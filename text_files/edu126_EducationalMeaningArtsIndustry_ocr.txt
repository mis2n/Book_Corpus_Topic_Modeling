  PREFACE 
The most vitally important and far-reaching educa- 
tional movement of our time is that which aims to intro- 
duce all along the line, from the lowest primary school 
to the senior college class, appropriate work in various 
kinds of manual arts and industries, including manual 
training, household arts, domestic science, agriculture 
and the like. And yet, when one wishes to know the 
reasons for the movement he looks in vain for an organ- 
ized treatment of the subject. In a hundred books and 
magazines one may find much that is valuable on this 
or that phase of the subject, but nowhere an attempt 
to relate these different aspects in a unified view. These 
conditions account for this book. 
It would be presumptuous to assume that this brief 
treatment exhausts the subject, or that on any phase of 
the question the last word has been said. The book is 
put forth in the hope that it contributes something to 
a clearer understanding and a more judicious promotion 
of a great movement. It aims to help those who, like 
myself, are working on the problem. 
For much of the general point of view presented 
throughout I am indebted to my former instructors in
-P-A-G-E-6
  the University of Chicago, especially to Professor John 
Dewey and Mrs. Ella Flagg Young. For guidance, 
encouragement, and direct personal help in the experi- 
mental studies my thanks are due to Professor James 
Rowland Angell, and for valuable criticisms and sug- 
gestions made upon the page proofs grateful acknowl- 
edgment is made to Dr. W. W. Charters, University of 
Missouri; Dr. John T. McManus, Chicago Normal 
School, and Professor George H. Tapy, Wabash College.

  CHAPTER I 
Tue PRosLeM OF THE Book 
“The old order changeth, yielding place to new, 
And God fulfills Himself in many ways, 
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.” 
Before entering upon the investigation of a problem 
it is only fair that the writer first make clear to the 
reader what the problem is, and then indicate the general 
line of the proposed attempt to find a solution. 
Conception of the Educative Process.—Notwith- 
standing all that has been spoken and written regarding 
education, it seems probable that the great majority of 
persons fail utterly to comprehend the meaning of the 
educative process, The most common misapprehension 
is the confusion of schooling, scholarship, an acquaint- 
ance with books, with education. Of one person it is 
said, “His parents gave him an excellent education, but 
he has never amounted to anything. He has failed in 
everything he has undertaken.” Another man who has 
proved himself unusually efficient in a calling requiring 
ability, sound judgment, and skill, is spoken of as “‘uned- 
ucated.” The fact is, the first man was not educated; 
he was merely schooled. Possibly nature gave him little 
that could be educated, or the years spent over books 
may have unfitted him for the kind of work he might 
have done with success, if his schooling had been along 
9
-P-A-G-E-12
  10 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
different lines. The second man was merely “unschooled,” 
unscholarly. But he must have had experiences, pro- 
cesses of training, that developed his power to do the 
things in which he had succeeded. Ultimately this must 
_~—~—_be the test of education, the judgment to determine what) 
is wort! ing, and the abili ing well 
ere is another aspect of this misapprehension that 
deserves a moment’s attention. To say a man was edu- 
cated at Harvard, at Oxford, or at Leipsic is almost as 
misleading as the uses of “educated” and “uneducated” 
referred to above. The years spent at college may have 
been very important factors in the development of power 
and character; but other experiences quite apart from 
any kind of schooling, as those of the home, for instance, 
may have been vastly more important. In like manner, 
to speak of one as having “finished his education” is 
utter nonsense, unless he has died or become an imbecile. 
Accordingly a “finishing school,” if true to its name, 
must be a horrible place. f 
Enough has been said to suggest our general con- 
~y ception of education as a whole life process, beginning 
at birth and ending at physical death, or with the failure 
of conscious powers. It is not only a whole life process 
as to time, but it involves the total experience of the 
organism during the lifetime—every thought, every 
feeling, every activity of nerve or muscle. Those who 
understand even the elements of educational psychology
-P-A-G-E-13
THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK 11 
know how every experience, that is, every thought, feel- 
ing, or act, leaves its impress upon the organism. After 
an activity of any kind the individual is not the same 
as before. This process of change is going on contin- 
uously. during life, and this is the “educative process.” 
Willy nilly we are being educated every moment, in 
some way, to some extent. 
This does not imply that the process is uniform in 
rate or in significance throughout life. During the period 
of physical growth the organism is most plastic, most 
impressionable, and the process goes on most rapidly. 
Childhood, from birth until early adolescence, is a period 
of distinctly sensory and motor development; during the 
adolescent period there should be a marked transition to 
reflective activities. There is no distinction in import- 
ance; each is important in its own peculiar time. Hence, 
to force the young child into studies requiring much 
reflection is to rob him of the opportunity for sensori- 
motor development, and stunt his growth in reflective 
power, while to over-emphasize the sensori-motor train- 
ing during the adolescent period is to set the interests 
and habits in those forms of activity. In either case there 
is hopeless retardation in the normal educative process. 
The Most Important Educational Institution.—If 
we accept the view that education is a whole life process, 
our next question is, What starts the process and keeps 
it going? To some extent it may be said to have its
-P-A-G-E-14
  12 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
initial impetus in the racial instincts with which the child 
is born, but to this there is immediately added the efforts 
of the child to adjust itself to its environment. In other 
words, the educative process is carried on by the activity 
of the individual impelled by some feeling of need, a 
desire to get control of something valued. In play it is 
the need of the pleasure tone of the activity itself; in 
other voluntary effort it is to attain something that 
seems of value to the individual. In the organization of 
society the life activities of the vast majority of the 
people have centered in and about the home. The 
children grew up in the home, shared in its activities 
and responsibilities, learned the arts that pertained to 
providing for and making a home. After an appren- 
ticeship, varying in length and success, the young people 
selected partners and started in the business of home- 
making for themselves. Thus the home was the first 
educational institution, and let us hope that it may long 
continue to be the most important means of education. 
It is exceedingly unfortunate that educators commonly 
talk and write as though the school were the one means 
of education. Parents often go a step farther, they 
act as though the school should assume all responsibility 
for the development of the child, physical, intellectual, 
and moral. 
The True Function of the School.—The school is an 
annex to the home; the teacher an assistant to the
-P-A-G-E-15
  
THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK 13 
parents. The phrase, in loco parentis, often used in 
school legislation, in defining the duties and responsibili- 
ties of the teacher, implies the real function of the teacher 
and of the school. The necessity for schools has been 
brought about by the natural evolution of society. As 
the family life became extended more and more into 
community life, needs became more diversified and duties 
more complex. Parents gradually found themselves 
unable to meet personally all the demands for the in- 
struction and training of their children. At first the 
teacher was brought into the home, or the sons (to whom 
it was thought special education was more important 
than to the daughters), were sent to boarding school. 
Later, several families, who could not well afford to 
adopt either of the above plans, combined in employing 
a teacher and in providing a schoolroom. Out of this 
cooperative school grew our free public school. His- 
torically, therefore, the function of the school is to pro- 
vide for carrying on certain kinds of training that were 
originally part of the ideal home life, and to extend this 
training in such ways as the developing community life 
seemed to make necessary or, desirable. The public 
school is now an organ of society, but with its roots 
“in the home and family life. Society’s ideal of education 
may be higher than that of the average home in the 
community, but it cannot be higher than that of the 
best homes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  14 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Possibly the ideal kindergarten furnishes the best 
example of the true function of the school. In a home 
where the mother has been well prepared for the duties 
of motherhood; has time to devote to her children; to 
direct, to some extent, their play; to tell and read appro- 
priate stories; to teach simple songs and melodies; to 
furnish suitable occupation in modeling, drawing, paint- 
ing, making; to explain some af the simple facts and 
processes that come under observation; for children in 
such a home the kindergarten is unnecessary. However, 
there are countless thousands of children not blessed 
with such a home. For the children of the untrained 
mother who does not know how to do the things enumera- 
ted above, for those of the overworked mother who has 
not time to do them, and for those of the over-leisured 
mother who does not realize her highest, most sacred 
duties and privileges, the kindergarten is an inestimable 
boon in that it does provide in a regular, well organized 
way, many of those experiences. The real test of the 
value of the kindergarten is the extent to which it carries 
on appropriately many of those activities, experiences, 
that should come abundantly to the life of the child in 
good home and community surroundings. 
Aim and Motive in Education.—By an aim we un- 
derstand that which one desires to do; by a motive, the 
reason for wishing to do it. All voluntary activity is 
inspired by a motive and guided by an aim. Society’s
-P-A-G-E-17
THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK 15 
aim in establishing and maintaining schools is to prepare 
its immature members for the duties and responsibilities 
of those who will soon pass off the stage. The motive 
is to conserve and develop the interests of the community 
life. The teacher is expected to understand both the 
aim and the motive of society, but the child knows very 
little of either. His voluntary activities arise from 
motives and are directed by aims of his own. In many 
ways the child can, to some extent, project himself into 
the future, can see what he must be able to do in order 
to take his part in the life of the home and of the com- 
munity, but in many others he is quite unable to do so. 
If the school continually imposes work for which the 
child has no personal motive, he becomes indifferent, in- 
attentive, idle, lazy, irresponsible. But, if the work is 
of a kind that appeals to his own motives he is interested, 
attentive, persistent, careful; he derives satisfaction and 
develops a right attitude, not only toward subsequent 
school work, but all work that seems worth while. 
As a people we are justly proud of our schools. In 
many ways they are excellent. But, when we congratu- 
late ourselves into self-satisfied complaisance, close our 
eyes to obvious defects, or neglect to search out weak- 
ness, we are disloyal to one of our most cherished insti- 
tutions. Why do so many children voluntarily leave 
school, if permitted, before they are fourteen years of 
age? Why do so many of those who remain grow in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
16 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
different and have to be spurred on in one way and 
another? Why are so many willing to go to “work,” 
even though they share but little in their earning? Is 
it because so much “school work” does not seem worth 
doing? While our children cry for bread, something 
of value in life, are we giving them stones, things that 
seem of no value? Why do they turn away from the 
things we offer? Or, if they gather them up to display 
them during the recitation, they soon drop them by the 
wayside, because nature has provided no means by which 
the child long retains the information he does not use. 
The Congested Curriculum.—Educators are pretty 
well agreed that courses of study are overcrowded, that 
pupils are required to do too many things, and hence the 
results, in both knowledge and training, lack thorough- 
ness. They are not agreed upon what can be eliminated. 
Let us consider some lines of work in the elementary 
school course to see whether the things we are doing 
appeal to real motives in the children. 
First, what shall we say of geography? When a 
student in high school the writer was invited to take an 
optional course in geography especially designed for 
teachers, Lesson number one was limited to the “rivers 
of Australia.” The rest of the course was not taken, 
and in a few days even the names of the rivers were 
forgotten because he had no use for them. In years of 
educational work and of business he has had no use for
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK 17 
the facts of that lesson. To many, that will seem an 
extreme case, but if they will face the problem frankly 
they cannot fail to see that every day, in the best schools 
in this country, young children are being required to 
learn lessons that to them are as useless as the “rivers 
of Australia.” Moreover, the course for children is not 
optional. The evil is further aggravated by the fact 
that, even in reputable schools, teachers require the 
pupils to learn the daily assignment in the “words of the 
book.” 
Second, let us take history. A good home or school 
environment will prompt most children to want to get 
some perspective of world history, and a little closer 
view of the growth of our own nation. In general the 
interest below the high school will center about a few 
heroes or other attractive personalities. But what is 
the common practice? With little or no background of 
earlier history, children twelve or thirteen years of age 
are taken through a text-book of United States history 
containing ten times as many details as they are expected 
to remember. Then both girls and boys spend a half 
year studying about “civil government,” for which, gen- 
erally speaking, they have as much feeling of need as a 
Hottentot has for Hegel. 
Again, most elementary schools teach arithmetic 
every day for eight years. Children in the first grade are 
“drilled” daily on number facts, most of which they 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
18 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
would learn out of school, or would learn with a fraction 
of the effort a little later. Problems are given in which 
the children have no direct interest. Often the problems 
are unintelligible to the children because they have had 
no experience through which to interpret them. The 
history of the work of many children in formal arith- 
metic, who for some reason have come to this subject 
late, shows the absurdity of the usual plan. These chil- 
dren often get control of arithmetic in half the time 
usually devoted to that subject. It is the opinion of 
many eminent authorities that fully half the time usually 
spent on arithmetic is worse than wasted. 
Then there is the old bugbear, technical grammar. 
At one time grammar was a high school subject; the 
first “grammar schools” in both America and Europe were 
college preparatory schools. Gradually it was forced 
down and down in the grades until it has been common 
to teach grammar during four or five years in the ele- 
mentary school. Children are thereby befuddled and 
discouraged before they understand what grammar means. 
There is, happily, evidence of a reaction against this 
absurd condition. An enquiry made in 1908 showed 
that in eighty per cent of the practice departments in the 
state normal schools of this country the teaching of 
formal grammar is deferred until the second year below 
the high school. But this reaction is not widespread. It 
is probably safe to say that in a large majority of our 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
THE PROBLEM OF THE BOOK 19 
schools formal grammar is begun at least two years 
earlier than it should be. The waste of time is bad, but 
that is a minor evil. The development in the child of 
the feeling that school work is not worth while, the 
consequent attitude of indifference, often aversion to 
this subject, and more or less toward all school work, is 
a serious, far-reaching wrong. 
Subjects Seeking More Recognition—While these 
and other wasteful conditions continually stare every 
alert, thoughtful educator in the face, other lines of 
work are pleading for their rightful recognition. To 
leaders in educational thought it has long been clear that 
the work of the public schools, those schools organized 
and maintained for all the people, should not be limited 
to the three R’s, or to those distinctly informational 
studies that have. generally pre-empted the whole course. 
Intelligent, fair-minded business men have condemned 
our school work as bookish and impractical. They say 
that our boys leave school with anywhere from seven to 
«twelve years of special training, acquaintance with books, 
but with little power to do things with their hands, not- 
withstanding that probably nine out of ten work chiefly 
with their hands the rest of their lives. Others point 
out that in the schooling of girls about the only things 
that are generally neglected are domestic science and 
household arts, the arts of “home-making” which ought 
to be the chief concern of the vast majority of women.

The Aim of this Thesis.—Assuming, without attempt- 
ing to submit evidence in detail, that, in accordance with 
the preceding statement, more satisfactory work in sev- 
eral school studies could, by certain readjustments, be 
done in much less time, it is the aim of this thesis to 
show.: 
First, the various educational values of training in 
certain forms of manual arts and industries, including 
manual training, cooking, sewing, mending, house furnish- 
ing and decoration, school gardening and agriculture. 
Second, in what part of the school course and to which 
classes of children this sort of training is relatively most 
important. 
Third, what general methods of training in these 
lines most fully realize their educational values.

~ CHAPTER II 
Tue DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION 
OF MaNnuaL OccuPaTIONS 
The date of the birth of manual occupations as a 
feature of school work has not been definitely located by 
writers on educational history. Probably it never will be 
determined. Like many other civilizing forces this one 
appears to have been at work for generations, if not 
centuries, before any one recognized its potency or the 
direction of its tendency. 
Egyptian Civilization—The civilization of any one 
of the ancient peoples is marvelously suggestive to us 
in this connection. Take for one example the first people 
known to have organized themselves into a settled nation, 
the Egyptians. Very early records, dating nearly 2,000 
years before the Christian era, show them to have been 
a people of versatile power and skill. Their masonry has 
never been surpassed. They had a decimal system of 
numbers, and a system of well adjusted weights and 
measures. In mechanic arts we have evidence of the 
skill of the carpenter, the book-binder, the potter, the 
weaver, the glass-blower and others. In fine arts their 
statuary and painting, their ornaments of gold and silver, 
their musical instruments, their engraving, their inlaying, 
all bear witness to a high stage of development in these 
a  
-P-A-G-E-24
  ee: MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
arts and processes. How had it come about? They 
were without books or a literature except in a very 
narrow sense. What they knew of physical and natural 
sciences could not have been organized for purposes of 
instruction. The science of mathematics was in a most 
elementary stage. 
How had these people been educated? There appears 
but one answer. They had developed their powers 
through their efforts to manipulate material things as a 
means of satisfying their felt needs and desires. Manual 
occupations must have involved a very large part of the 
active life of the people, must have been in a large 
measure *the medium through which they found their 
problems and solved them, and hence must have been im- 
portant factors in the progress of such a people. 
Hebrew Education.—The civilization of the early 
Hebrew people was as témarkable in its spiritual con- 
ception as that of the Egyptians in its industrial and 
artistic power. Yet the Hebrews of that time had little 
literature and less science and mathematics. The boys 
only were taught to read and write, and this usually 
merely to the extent that they might read the Scriptures 
and understand their religious duties. The girls were 
taught to spin, weave and embroider, to prepare food for 
the table, to superintend the household work, and gen- 
erally to sing and uance. Much importance was attached 
to the training of the boys in manual work. The majority 
 
-P-A-G-E-25

HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION 23 
of them became farmers, but it is significant that an oft 
quoted Rabbinical saying of that time was: 
“He that teacheth not his son a handicraft maketh 
him an associate of thieves.” 
For the girls the chief means of education were the 
social intercourse of the family and of the community 
and the domestic occupations just mentioned above. The 
boys apparently fared somewhat better, but the point is 
that without book learning Jewish women became com- 
monly the equal of their brothers and husbands, and that 
these limited means of education did produce a great 
people. 
Luther.—As early as the beginning of the sixteenth 
century, Martin Luther, the great religious reformer, 
strongly urged the introduction of training in manual 
occupations into the schools as a means of economic and 
moral development. About the same time Zwingli, the 
Swiss reformer, made similar recommendations to his 
people. fr é 
Comenius.—So far as we know, however, it was 
John Amos Comenius, 1592-1671, who first apprehended 
and presented the true significance of manual occupations 
as a factor in education. He wrote: 
“Finally, they would learn the most important 
principles of what goes on in the world around them, 
and that any special inclination teward things of 
this kind may assert itself with greater ease later on. ‘ae.

“The class lessons should not exceed four hours 
daily, of which two should be before midday, and 
two after. The remaining hours of the day may 
profitably be spent in domestic work (especially 
among the poor), or in some form of recreation.” * 
Francke, toward the close of the sixteenth century 
introduced instruction in wood working, glass cutting, 
and pasteboard work into his school at Halle. 
Locke, 1632-1704, said every boy should learn a trade 
or craft, and recommended gardening, husbandry, car- 
pentry, work in iron, brass, or silver. He also proposed 
a plan for a working school for poor children. The 
object of this school was to accustom the children to 
work, to relieve mothers of their care, and, at the same 
time, relieve the parish in part of the cost of supporting 
such children by giving it the benefit of their work. 
Rousseau, 1712-1778, recommended that when be- 
tween 12 and 15 years of age Emile should learn a trade 
and gave the preference to carpentry. While his plan 
for the education of a girl reveals a mediaeval conception, 
it is worthy of note that Sophie should learn to sew, 
embroider, and make lace, to be industrious, to dance, 
and to sing. 
Martin Planta, 1727-1772, a distinguished Swiss 
clergyman, who seems to have been the herald of Pestal- 
0zzi, established a school in which manual work was a 
Comenius. “The Great Didactic.’ Chapter XXIX.

prominent feature. The children were engaged in garden- 
ing, wood working, pasteboard work, and like occupa- 
tions. More advanced pupils made their own apparatus 
for experimental and demonstration work in physical and 
mathematical studies. 
Kinderman, 1740-1801, an educational reformer of 
Bohemia, first forced the question into public discussion 
by protesting against the limitation of the work of the 
elementary schools to merely supplying information, 
much of which could have no direct connection with the 
present interests or the future needs of the children, and 
the utter neglect of preparation for or training in the ac- 
tivities in which the children must later engage. He says: 
“T became convinced that this was the cause of 
much laziness and poverty, of unfruitfal life, and of 
great wickedness. 
“Working classes and reading classes must be 
combined. This is the only way that industry can 
be made a national characteristic.” 
As a result of his work, it is said, some 200 manual 
training departments were organized in connection with 
the primary schools of Bohemia. 
Pestalozzi, 1746-1827, lays much stress upon the 
necessity of providing a system of manual instruction. 
In some of his own schools the pupils were engaged in 
manual occupations more than half the time.

In 1791 Arnold Wageman of Gottingen, Germany, 
wrote “Uber die Bildung des Volks zur Industrie,” ad- 
vocating the introduction of industrial work in the 
schools. He says: 
“It is wrong to begin school work with direct 
instruction in subjects that are purely mental, and 
amount to nothing more than mere memory lessons, 
since the child has had no experience, and it is only 
experience that can give interest to the study of 
abstract subjects. It would be better to follow the 
hints of Nature, who allows the growth of the body 
in early childhood to supersede that of the mind. 
“We need only, unobserved by the children, to 
watch them at their occupations after school hours. 
We will soon see how we ought to busy them in the 
class room, in order to make their school life both 
agreeable and useful.” 
Dr. I. G. Krunitz, in 1794, published his “The Country 
Schools Viewed as Instructional and Manual, or Indus- 
trial, Schools,” in which he strongly reinforced Wage- 
man’s position. By royal command this book was ordered 
to be bought by every parish in Prussia. 
A. H. Niemeyer, 1754-1828, rector of the University 
of Halle, pointed out that the great problem of elementary 
education was to find an occupation suitable to each stage 
of development of the child.*

HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION Zz 
J. H. G. Heusinger, 1766-1837, the forerunner of 
Froebel advocated the same principles and made sug- 
gestions regarding the choice of occupations in his “Uber 
die Beniitzung des bei Kindern so thatigen Triebes, 
beschaftigt zu sein,” and in “Die Familie Wertheim.” 
Fallenberg, 1771-1844, established an agricultural and 
industrial colony on his estate, Hofwyl, a few miles north 
of Berne, Switzerland. A feature of this colony was 
known as the “Poor School,” having for its motto, “Pray 
and Work.” In this school it is said the children were 
chiefly occupied in the fields, in shops and with house: 
work, Their recreation was instruction in theoretical 
studies. 
Johann Jacob Wehrli, 1790-1855, was for many years 
director of Fallenberg’s “Poor School.” Under him the 
school gained such a reputation that many similar schools, 
known as Wehrli Schools, were established in Germany. 
Fichte, 1762-1814, emphasized the importance of in- 
corporating manual training into the national schools by 
positing it as the true aim of education to train the 
young in the line of their probable future work, hence 
the training should combine practical labor with theoreti- 
cal instruction. Every one should be taught how to work 
that he may not be tempted to commit crime to satisfy 
his needs. 
Froebel, 1783-1852, made a distinct advance upon his 
predecessors, not only in introducing so much in the By 
| Vv 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  \ 
28 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
of manual occupations into his kindergarten system, but 
in his advocacy of the value of training in such occupa- 
tions throughout the school course. To him such occu- 
pations were more than a means of preparing for a 
manual trade, more than a protection from idleness, more 
than a training for hand and eye; they were an essential 
means of self-expression.{ Before his time, the method of 
\ the schools Rt eck that the child mind was 
receptive and reproductive. It was apparently taken for 
  \ 
granted that only “what goes in can come out.” Froebel 
made practical application of the view that mind is “pro- 
ductive and creative.” This practice he carried into the 
occupations., Children were expected to think and do, to 
produce things different from anything that had been 
shown or explained to them. 
Switzerland.—Another very significant fact comes 
from Switzerland. In 1854, a Swiss statesman named 
Schwindler offered a prize for the best answer to the 
question: “How shall instruction in our elementary 
schools be freed from its present abstract method, and be 
made more conducive to true mental development?’ The 
question attracted much attention, was discussed freely in 
the public press, and many answers by leading educators 
of the time were submitted. Among the most significant 
were, “The Working Schools of the Parishes in their 
true Relation to the Elementary Schools,” by Dr. Conrad 
Michaelson, and “Education to Work, a Demand which
-P-A-G-E-31
  
HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION 29 
Life makes of the School,” by Karl Biederman. The 
former work was a plea for a combination of the working 
schools, that had been started here and there; with the 
elementary schools of the country, which were essentially 
book schools. Biederman’s work was still more valuable. 
He based his plea for manual occupations in school on 
the nature of the child and upon the general physical, 
intellectual, and moral results of such training. 
France.—In the meantime France was not lagging 
behind. The spirit of the Revolution infected every phase 
of life. In 1793 Robespierre proposed to the National 
Assembly a bill for a new educational scheme, prepared 
by Michael de Peletier. The plan aimed to instill the duty 
of the habit of work, not as thorough knowledge of any 
specific trade, but as the development of that energy and 
industrious activity which characterizes earnest, diligent 
persons. Peletier says: 
“T consider this part of education the most im- 
portant, and therefore my plan of general instruction 
contains manual labor as its vital feature. Of all 
the means likely to stimulate the average child, none 
will produce a greater desire for activity than physi- 
cal work. I would desire that various kinds of 
handicraft work might be introduced.” 
Sweden.—In Sweden we find Torsten Rudenschold, 
1798-1859, an earnest advocate of manual training as  
-P-A-G-E-32
  30 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
a factor in healthful development, but especially as a 
precautionary preparation for the needs of adult life. 
The progress of the movement is more clearly seen in 
“The Principles for the Study of Educational Instruc- 
tion,” by Ziller, professor of pedagogy in the University 
of Leipzig, and published in 1864. A notable passage is: 
“Theoretical and practical work should, as far as 
possible, bear one another out. On the one hand 
natural science, mathematics, history, geography and 
drawing should offer problems to the shop, and on 
the other hand, the practical experiences gathered in 
the manual work should make book lessons the more 
easily learned.” 
Summary.—Glancing backward we can see the grad- 
ual development of the recognition of manual arts and 
industries as an important factor in the process of edu- 
cation. A new conception was, during three centuries, 
evolving itself in the minds of religious and moral re- 
. formers, educators, and statesmen in Germany, France, 
Prussia, England, and Austria. While some of these men 
appear to have had a quite clear and comprehensive view 
of the real significance of what they advocated, the gen- 
eral conception, and especially the more common applica- 
tion of it threw the emphasis upon two ideas. First. the 
aim was to develop a kind of manual skill or handicraft, 
to the poor children a means of livelihood, or of bettering 
their material condition in life; to the children of the
-P-A-G-E-33
    HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION 31 
wealthy an inalienable resource in case of loss of their 
wealth. Second, the purpose was to train boys and girls 
into habits of productive industry not only for the posi- 
tive moral value of such training in itself, but to avoid the 
corrupting and corroding influence of idleness. 
When we consider how long the reform had been ad- 
vocated, how widespread the movement had become, and 
how many reasonably satisfactory experiments had been 
made, it is not surprising that plans for carrying on the 
work were systematized and established in several coun- 
tries almost simultaneously. 
Finland.—In 1858, Cygnaeus, a teacher in Finland, 
outlined a simple course in manual training for the 
schools of his country, and in 1866 it was made obligatory 
in all elementary and manual schools. The plan was to 
supplement the gifts and occupations of the kindergarten, 
and the work included joinery, turning, and basket mak- 
ing, not with a view to instructing in a trade but with 
strict reference to the universal aim of education. 
Russia.—In 1868, Victor Della Vos, Director of the 
Imperial Technical School of St. Petersburg, instituted 
a formal course in tool instruction. The Russian system 
had a three-fold aim: 1. To give an acquaintance with 
the nature and functions of the various tools used. 2. To 
instruct regarding the character, uses and limitations of 
the materials worked upon. 3. To train in planning, 
shaping and assembling the parts of models to be con-
-P-A-G-E-34
  32 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
structed. The system included work in both wood and 
iron, turning, carpentry, forging, and fitting. 
Sweden.—Swedish educators claim to have had some 
form of Sloyd since 1850, but it was not until 1870 that 
this system was introduced into the primary schools of 
the country. To encourage its introduction a royal man- - 
date provided for the payment of a special stipend of 
75 kroner ($21) yearly to each school in which Sloyd 
was taught. The system is too well known to need 
description, but the aims set forth by its advocates are 
of interest, viz.: to instill a love for work, to develop 
habits of order, attention, self-reliance, a sense of form 
and a high degree of manual dexterity. Sloyd spread 
rapidly to Norway, Germany, Austria, Denmark and 
America. 
France.—In 1882 the French provided for a system 
known as “L ’enseignement du Travail Manuel,” and 
made it compulsory in the public schools. Provision 
was at once made for preparing teachers to instruct boys 
in bench and lathe work in wood, iron work at the forge, 
drawing, modeling and molding. Girls were to be taught 
various kinds of needlework, cutting, and dressmaking. 
The aim of the introduction in this kind of work was 
apparently economic—to fit the children of the working 
classes for efficient and satisfactory work such as they 
would probably have to do, to develop a love for work 
through the habit of working successfully. 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION 33 
The United States—In this country, Worcester, 
Mass., had, in 1868, a technical school for students 
learning mechanical engineering. In 1870 the University 
of Illinois had wood working and iron working shops 
for students of architecture and engineering. The 
Stevens Institute of Hoboken, N. J., began similar work 
in 1871, and Washington University at St. Louis in 1872. 
A great impetus was given to the movement by the 
work of Della Vos’s pupils exhibited at the Centennial 
Exposition in 1876. Within ten years manual training 
schools, or departments, were established in St. Louis, 
Baltimore, Chicago, Eau Claire (Wisconsin), Toledo, 
New York, Philadelphia H. S., Omaha H. S., Denver, 
Cleveland H. S., Cincinnati, Minneapolis, and many other 
places. Little more than a quarter of a century has 
passed since the first real manual training school was 
established in this country. According to the report of 
the Commissioner of Education, 1899-1900, there were 
in the United States 144 schools specially devoted to 
manual and industrial training, having an attendance of 
41,736 pupils. Besides this, various forms of manual 
training other than drawing were taught in the public 
schools of 169 cities of over 8,000 population. Educa- 
tional reforms usually progress slowly, but this manual 
training movement has been phenomenally rapid, in some 
cases more rapid than rational. 
Conception of the Work.—While many of the early
-P-A-G-E-36
  34 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
advocates of the educational value of manual occupations 
seem to have had prophetic insight into its true signifi- 
cance, and the writings of some indicate a pretty clear 
intellectual conception of the broader and higher view, 
and while the idea of preparing children for trades has 
been continually repudiated, it is clear that the work 
under these systems, as they have been applied, has rarely 
risen above the idea of improving visual perception and 
developing manual skill. Note the expressed aims of the 
various systems. Hoffman says: 
“The primary object of the Russian method was 
to teach the child manual work, if not directly for 
the purpose of fitting him for a future vocation in 
the arts or trades, at least in order to make him 
more capable, in case he should select some mechan- 
_ical pursuit as his future work in life. 
a The Sloyd has for its first object to give an 
indirect preparation for life by teaching branches of 
certain trades and by imparting general dexterity 
to the hand. 
“The object of the French system is clearly ex- 
pressed in the words of the French Minister of 
Public Instruction: ‘The love for work can only 
come through the habit of working, and, reciprocally, 
the habit of work can only come by implanting a 
2994 love for it.

HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION 35 
In Germany and England the movement at first met 
much opposition from educators because it seemed to 
be an attempt to yoke the trade school with the school of 
letters. 
It may seem a strange, unwarranted statement to 
say that in America the general conception of manual 
training has not been much higher or broader. Look 
at some of the evidence. 
It was first introduced in this country into purely 
technical and industrial institutions, and the work was 
generally carried on in the same way as in a good trade 
school. 
The next step was the establishment of special manual 
training high schools, or of special departments in high 
schools for those students who were repelled by the regu- 
lar courses. Though it has been working its way down into 
the common schools, it is usually limited at first to one 
or two of the higher grades. Of the 169 cities of over 
8,000 population reported as having manual training 
in the public schools only 24 had extended it below the 
fifth grade. 
Later reports are more favorable. In 1906-7 there 
were 644 cities, of over 4,000 population, teaching manual 
training in the public schools, of which nearly one-half 
had some work below the fifth grade. But of the students 
taking this work only about 25 per cent are in the ele- 
mentary schools.  
-P-A-G-E-38
  36 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Narrow Views.—In many cases the first qualification 
sought in the teacher of manual training was skill in the 
use of tools. Frequently that was the only educational 
qualification required. The first manual training school 
the writer knew was put in charge of a carpenter, a man 
who for thirty years had done nothing but build houses, 
a man who knew practically nothing of schools, of books 
or of boys. The school lived less than half a year. 
Perhaps this was an extreme case; it certainly was not an 
isolated one. Very many of those appointed to establish 
manual training were mechanics, perhaps good mechanics 
(certainly not teachers), or persons of meager education 
who took a course in manual training at a summer school 
or some other short-course institution. 
But the special teacher was not alone in his limited 
views. City superintendents, reputed wide-awake and 
progressive, have confined manual training to the high 
school, or isolated it entirely from the other school work. 
or publised courses in manual occupations which indi- 
cate clearly that the work is regarded chiefly as mechani- 
cal training having no organic relation with the rest of 
the child’s life, either in or out of school. 
The kind of work usually done in the schools and 
proudly placed on exhibition, the talk of training “the 
eye to see and the hand to execute,” of following “shop 
practice,” of “practical education for the working classes” 
clearly revealed the conception that prevails.
-P-A-G-E-39
HISTORY OF EDUCATIONAL CONCEPTION SZ 
Discussion of the subject commonly indicated a 
higher point of view, but even in discussion there was 
abundant evidence that manual training meant little more 
than manual skill. 
Dr. W. T. Harris will be acknowledged by all as 
eminent authority. He says: 
“When we admit that the use of tools in the 
manufacture of articles of wood or iron is educative, 
we do not say much for it.. . . . But is is claimed 
that skill in the use of tools in these trades would 
be valuable to all, no matter what their employment 
might be. This, however, is a position that cannot 
be maintained. . . . . Manual training, if it in- 
cludes only wood and metal work, fits only eight 
per cent for their vocation, and more or less unfits 
for their vocation a large part of the remaining 
ninety-two per cent of laborers,” + 
It may be said that Dr. Harris has not been much 
in sympathy with manual training. Then let us turn 
to Dr. C. M. Woodward, one of its pioneer advocates in 
this country. In explaining the origin and purpose of 
the St. Louis Manual Training School he wrote: 
“The youth of today are to be the men of the 
next generation. It is important that we keep their 
probable life work in view in providing for their

education. . . . . As has often been said, nearly all 
our skilled workmen are imported, our best machin- 
ists, miners, weavers, watchmakers, iron workers, 
draughtsmen and artisans of every description, come 
from abroad; and this is not because our native-born 
are deficient in natural tact or ability, nor because 
they are in point of fact above and beyond such 
occupations, but because they are without suitable 
means and opportunities for getting proper train- 
ing 42 
Again referring to the Felix Adler Workingman’s 
School, he says: 
“Unlike the manual training school proper, it is 
a school for the youngest children. Its course of 
study ends at fourteen years, just when our school 
begins.” 
Such evidence can be multiplied indefinitely, and 
while much may be offered in defense, it cannot affect 
the verdict that even in America the general conception 
of manual training has been largely limited to the idea 
of preparing for manual trades. That it does this, and 
that this is an important result, is true, but the point is 
that this is not the chief reason for manual arts and in- 
dustries in the elementary schools. 
Our aim is to show that this does not represent the

most advanced theory of the manual element in education. 
Other educators have taken higher ground and attained 
a clearer, better perspective view. They rejoice in what 
has been accomplished and appreciate the efforts of those 
who have done so much to propagate manual training 
and household arts in the schools. They recognize that 
a change so great and vital could come about only by an 
evolutionary process, and that in this case the evolution 
has been phenomenally rapid. The attitude of those who 
have gone farther in the study of this subject, it is the 
purpose of subsequent chapters to set forth. For, 
“Whether manual training schools shall develop 
into industrial schools for the training of apprentices 
to the several trades, or on the other hand become 
incorporated into the school system as a general dis- 
cipline, depends, of course, upon the answer which 
educational psychology finally gives to the ques- 
tion.” 2

CHAPTER III 
_ FunDAMENTAL ImpuLsEs AND INTERESTS THE Basis OF 
Manuva Occupations AS MEANS OF EpucaTION 
Marvelous progress has been made in modes of gen- 
erating, controlling, and utilizing that mysterious and 
subtle force we call electricity, notwithstanding the fact 
that we do not know the nature of the thing itself. The 
scientist and the inventor have studied the thing through 
its modes of manifestation, through what it does under 
varying conditions. Similarly, wonderful progress has 
been made in the control of plant life. From the brier 
rose we have the American Beauty and from the bitter 
astringent husk of the almond we have the luscious 
flesh of the peach. Yet we do not know the nature of 
plant life, we know it only as a force, an activity which 
manifests itself in various ways under different condi- 
tions. 
Difficulty of Subject—With what added force the 
principle here suggested applies to human life and to 
the study of the development of human mind! We can- 
not take a specimen of life or of mind, isolate it, analyze 
it, and definitely describe and define it. We can only 
observe the manifestations of the activities at different 
stages and amid various environments. The multiplicity 
and the complexity of intellectual and emotional activi- 
40
-P-A-G-E-43
FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 41 
ties, make their study supremely difficult. However, the 
subtle and complicated conditions of the problem must 
not deter the educator from attacking it and working 
toward its solution, for progress in the science and art 
of education must always be conditioned primarily by 
progress in the development of knowledge concerning 
the being to be educated. 
Point of View.—American educators must have the 
credit for having given a great impetus to the investi- 
gation of one important phase of the problem, that most 
ancient department of human enquiry under its newer 
name of “child-study.” It is true, individual students 
of this subject expose themselves to ridicule by unscien- 
tific methods and by hasty generalizations. Some remind 
one of young ducks feeding upon mush, each taking up 
a little lump and running to one side in the apparent be- 
lief he has the whole thing. One takes later infancy, 
the kindergarten period, marks off definite limits and 
sees in that period all the life of the individual worthy 
of consideration ; another takes “recapitulation” and fan- 
cies he sees in every child at different stages the cave 
dweller, the fisher, the hunter, the shepherd, etc.; still 
another sees a clearly defined adolescent period freighted 
with dreadful dangers to the physical, intellectual, and 
moral life of the youth or maiden, as well as with opulent 
opportunities to them and to parents and teachers to de- 
velop a race of prodigies. In other words, the tendency
-P-A-G-E-44
42 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
is to take narrow views limited to particular sections of 
child life, instead of trying to get a perspective view of 
the whole life process, so that childhood may be inter- 
preted, not from a part of childhood, or by itself alone, 
but in relation to the whole life of the individual in all 
its bearings. 
Common Errors.—As a result of imperfect views of 
childhood two common errors have prevailed in educa- 
tional practice. First, some would set up an ideal adult 
as the aim of education,. and try to superimpose the quali- 
ties and characteristics of that adult upon the child as 
early and as rapidly as possible. Second, others would 
accept the common characteristics of childhood, as they 
manifest themselves in a fairly good environment, as 
being natural, and therefore good, hence to be fostered 
and cultivated as they are and so perpetuated. The for- 
mer view takes little or no account of the nature of the 
child, of the real potentialities with which formal edu- - 
cation must deal in order to produce that remote ideal 
result. The latter fails to recognize that the impulses, 
attitudes, and activities peculiar to childhood have only 
a temporary value. They are good for their time and 
in their relation to the future, but if perpetuated are sure 
to debilitate or arrest growth. They are, however, of 
such vital importance that we proceed to give them 
special consideration. 
\/Important Factors.—The prime factors in all educa-  
-P-A-G-E-45
FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 43 
tive processes are the impulses to activity, whether physi- 
cal or psychical. They are the fundamental characteris- 
tics of life, developed and differentiated in the evolution- 
ary process. They constitute the endowment that the 
child brings with him into the world which makes growth, 
development, education, possible. The sensory organism 
is predisposed to receive sensation, the brain is predis- 
posed to receive and the mind to select and analyze stim- 
uli; the muscles are predisposed to receive nervous dis- 
charge and to respond by contractions. All this must 
not only be recognized, but it must be basal in our 
conception of the whole educative process. 
A second group of factors are the stimulations that 
the impulses to activity receive from the environment of 
the individual. These stimuli might be called the op- 
portunities the impulses seek for their self-expression. 
Granted that there may be a limited range of activities 
in the system of voluntary muscles due to organic ac- 
cumulation and discharge of nervous energy, such move- 
ments have little educative value, they rather serve as 
a means of distributing, equalizing energy. The great 
mass of activities are, directly or indirectly, responses 
to environmental stimulations. Without such stimula- 
tions the impulses could never become anything more 
than mere impulses. From another point of view, in ad- 
dition to being the opportunity for the expression of the 
impulses, the stimulus appears as an obstruction to some
-P-A-G-E-46
  44 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
activity in the life process. If it were possible for the 
life process to flow on in a steady, uniform, wholly unim- 
peded way, there would be nothing to overcome, to con- 
trol, hence no development, no education. The opposition 
created by the stimulus necessitates inquiry, investigation 
as to the nature of the obstruction, persistent effort to 
understand and get control of it, and finally a readjust- 
ment, a reorganization of the forces with increased 
power to meet subsequent new conditions. 
Having taken this general view of the impulses we 
are prepared to consider their differentiated modes of 
manifestation, but for the purpose of this study we shall 
here limit our view to those directly relevant to manual 
arts and industries. 
Impulse to Sensation.—Among the strongest special 
impulses universal to the race is the impulse to get sensa- 
tion, to see, to hear, to touch. Though the last is es- 
pecially marked in early childhood it is by no means lim- 
ited to that or to any other period, as the familiar signs 
“Hands Off,” and “Please Do not Handle’ in exhibitions 
testify. The child turns his eyes toward the light to get 
more of the sensation. Bright colors attract and hold 
his attention. In’a similar way he tries to locate sound. 
When he discovers that he has control of some means of 
producing sound he is likely to use his power in count- 
less repetitions. When his hand touches an object, unless 
the sensation is distinctly unpleasant, he grasps the ob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 45 
ject or presses his hand against it so as to get more con- 
tact, more sensation. A bright rattle appeals to his eye, 
his ear, and his hand, and therefore has a triple charm. 
Motor Impulse.—Most intimately connected with this 
impulse to get, and the interest in, sensation is the impulse 
to motor activity. Besides the early movements that may 
be due to organic stimulations, there is from the first a 
tendency to set up sensori-motor coordinations, to facili- 
tate the repetition of those stimuli that give satisfaction 
to the organism. This point requires no elaboration be- 
cause the physical activity of the normal child is his most 
obvious characteristic. In fact it is only as he becomes 
reflective and “stops to think,” that is, checks some of the 
larger movements, that there is any prolonged suspension 
of physical activity while awake. 
Impulse to Play.—As these early activities, so largely 
instinctive, gradually come under the influence of con- 
scious control, they have added to them other qualities, 
and become the means of expressing the play impulse. 
The child plays with his vocal organs and at the same 
time with his auditory sense as he coos and babbles his 
first syllables. He plays with the water in his bath; 
with a spool or a ball for the joy of the motion; with 
sand or clay because it yields so readily to his manipula- 
tions; with pieces of paper because they readily move 
and make a noise. Later he runs about in mere physical 
wantonness. Whether this play impulse serves the pur-  
-P-A-G-E-48
46 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
pose of developing in the young those powers which have 
been evolved by the race, or whether it is merely a 
means of discharging surplus energy does not concern us 
in this discussion. We cannot, however, overlook its rela- 
tion to materials employed. Play, like work, must take 
materials as they are found, and, like work, it must 
adapt the materials to its peculiar needs at any particular 
time. Work actually reconstructs the material, divides 
it, and combines it in entirely new ways. Pure play trans- 
forms materials simply by the symbolizing power of the 
player’s imagination. A block of wood is now a ship 
and now a street car; a chair may be a horse or a car- 
riage or a pulpit. No transformation presents the slight- 
est difficulty to the magic mirror of the child’s imagina- 
tion. 
Social Impulse.—In trying to determine the normal 
course of growth and development we must, always take 
into account the social life of the individual. One is al- 
ways in a large measure the creature of the social medium 
into which he is born and in which he lives. A part of 
his racial inheritance is the social impulse. The young 
child’s early interests are almost exclusively personal and 
social. Apart from what he is conscious of doing, it is 
what other members of the family or what his immediate 
associates do and say that interests him. It is most natu- 
ral that these social interests should be important factors 
in the progressive development of the child’s activities.  
-P-A-G-E-49
FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 47 
Impulse to Imitate——The impulse to imitation, which 
has already been operative with the pure play impulse, 
finds a most convenient medium for its expression in the 
household and neighborhood occupations. Boys and girls 
are often equally interested in making bread or pies, in 
sewing, or in gardening. It is true these modes of activ- 
ity with the young child have in them little of the spirit 
of work. Through imitation the children play at work- 
ing, but, owing to the love of change and lack of definite 
purpose, progress is soon interrupted, though the impulse 
does not necessarily cease to operate. Attention and in- 
terest and activity are simply transferred to some other 
channel where this same imitative impulse continues to 
find expression. 
Impulse to Construct.——In the normal development 
of the child, guided and stimulated by social interests 
growing out of the impulses to physical activity, to play, 
to imitate, there develops the impulse to make things, 
the producing, constructive impulse, involving more clear- 
ly defined purposes, more continued attention, more per- 
sistent effort, and yielding the satisfaction which accom- 
panies each and all of these, but especially that which 
attends the tangible products of purposes accomplished. 
Impulse to Experiment.—The effort to satisfy this 
impulse to do, to construct, to manipulate materials leads 
naturally to the expression of two other impulses. First, 
there is the impulse to investigate and experiment. Some- 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
48 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
times this is simply a naive desire to see how things will 
act. Frequently it is a necessary element in the process 
of trying to work out the purposes and plans involved. 
Different kinds of materials must be tested and different 
modes of construction tried. Frequently, however, the 
experiment is a mere incidental episode suggested in the 
progress of the work, but scarcely less valuable because 
incidental. First-hand information is gained, and the 
mind kept alert and receptive by unlooked for changes. 
The Artistic Impulse.—The second is still more im- 
portant in connection with our subject, the impulse to 
decorate, the art impulse. When one comes to feel a con- 
scious power over his materials, is aware of a degree of 
technical skill in working, realizes a degree of pleasure 
in manipulating the materials, the art impulse begins to 
assert itself. He wants to add decoration to his work. 
He wants to express his feelings of joy in his work as 
well as his intellectual interest in the problem involved. 
Ownership Impulse.—Finally, there is the impulse 
to, and interest in, personal ownership, which finds its 
fullest expression in those things we have produced. With 
what wholesome pride the little girl shows the doll’s dress 
she has made. How much more satisfaction the boy gets 
out of the sleigh he made than out of the one his father 
bought for him. He is a rare, abnormal student who 
seems to get any satisfaction out of the essay he has 
largely cribbed. That kind of thing is usually done for 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 49 
prizes, or for class credits, or for public declamation. 
But an original piece of composition, produced because 
the writer has seen, thought, and felt something worth 
telling, “though a puir thing, his ain,” is always a source 
of pleasure to the author. The young bride rejoices, 
with very commendable pride, in the pie, or cake, or, if 
she be especially efficient, the loaf of bread, of her “own 
make.” The prosperous business or professional man 
takes vastly more interest in the products of his own 
flower plot, or of the fruit tree he has planted and 
pruned, than in the best his wealth can buy. The marvel- 
ous development of machinery for manufacturing, with all 
its accompanying advantages has had this disadvantage, 
that it has deprived the worker of a large part of the 
personal pride and joy he had in the work of his hands. 
It is not unreasonable to hope that shorter hours for 
the factory worker, cheaper and better transportation 
to suburban homes, training in manual occupations in the 
schools, growth of the arts and crafts idea, and develop- 
ment of an appreciation of the difference between machine 
made decoration and the work of the artist-artisan, may 
restore to civilized man in general, and to the city dweller 
especially, much of that joy in human production of 
which machinery has deprived him. 
Unity of Impulses.—This enumeration of the im- 
pulses and interests must not be taken to imply that they 
exist or function in independent and discrete ways. Their
-P-A-G-E-52
50 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
unity may be seen from two different points of view. 
First, they all come under the general concept of the 
child’s impulse to activity. During consciousness the 
whole being continually seeks to express itself in these 
and many other ways. It is the same unit of life and per- 
sonality that plays, imitates, constructs, and decorates. 
The diversity is outside thé child, in the objects of the 
activity, in the materials used, and in the results produced. 
From another point of view they must be unified in 
the social life of the child which so largely conditions the 
particular modes of activity. The impulse to locomo- 
tion, no doubt strongly instinctive as in lower animals, 
is stimulated by the observation of persons walking 
about, and by the desire to get to persons or objects by 
which the social life surrounds the child. The impulse 
to imitate comes out only in response to the observation 
of some act to be imitated. The impulse to do, to make 
things, would probably never realize itself in action un- 
less the child saw things that had been made or, better 
still, saw them in the process of making. 
There is also unity in the personal motives of the 
child. All conscious activities are directed toward the 
attainment of some end, something the child values. 
Treatment of the Impulses.—That these impulses ex- 
ist and are potent elements of human life is beyond ques- 
tion. The problem for the educator is, what shall be
-P-A-G-E-53
  
FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 51 
done with them? How shall they be treated? At least 
four modes of treatment suggest themselves. 
First.—It is possible to conceive of a scheme of edu- 
cation which should ignore them, take no actual account 
of them. It would set up the ideal character to be de- 
veloped, arrange the course of instruction and training 
that seemed best adapted to produce that type of charac- 
ter, then apply these. means to each child irrespective of 
his personality. If the child does not seem to profit by 
the instruction, or objects to the training, ignore the fact 
or impress*upon him that what he likes or dislikes to do 
cannot be taken into account, that his parents and teach- 
ers know best what will be for his future good and he 
must, willy nilly, be guided by them. 
Second.—Another mode of treating these impulses 
might be based upon the idea that in the child they are 
productive of no good result. His play impulse yields 
nothing of value, that is, it never produces anything of 
practical utility, or of commercial value. Nay more, it 
must inevitably lead to habits of idleness and immorality. 
The constructive impulse, it might be said, is usually 
rather destructive. The child simply spoils materials 
and tools and produces nothing of value. It is folly to 
give the child tools and materials until he is old enough 
to know how to use them to some useful purpose. Simi- 
larly, the art impulse might, from this point of view, be 
described as simply a means of disfiguring and wasting  
-P-A-G-E-54
  2) MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
material. It is impossible for a young child to produce 
anything of artistic value. His favorite drawings are 
likely to be caricatures of his friends, his paintings hid- 
eous daubs of crude color. Such practice can only give 
him low, distorted views of art. From such a point of 
view these impulses should be suppressed. Instead of 
allowing the child to play he should, as early as possible, 
have regular work adapted to his ability. Instead of 
building play houses and mock forts and crude boats he 
should be learning to read and write and spell, because, 
though he may have little interest in these things now, 
they will be useful to him later. The impulses of the 
child should be suppressed and supplanted by interests 
and habits that will be of value to him in later life. 
Third—Then again, precisely the opposite of this 
view might be taken. The natural impulses of the child 
are good, therefore they should be fostered and perpetu- 
ated. The play impulse is an expression of the instinct 
of the young to those activities which develop the racial 
inheritance of powers. When the child makes a stick 
symbolize a horse, a boat, or a gun, he is simply exercising 
his imagination, a power that will be to him not only a 
source of great pleasure through life, but an essential 
means of study whether of literature, history or science. 
This transforming power of the imagination should be 
kept alive. Human life never lacks the serious matter- 
of-fact work-a-day elements. Let the child continue to 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
FUNDAMENTAL IMPULSES AND INTERESTS 53 
indulge his childish impulses and interests to the full, 
and perpetuate them as completely as possible. 
Finally.—To ignore the impulses named would be the 
same in principle as to ignore the impulse to take food, 
to take rest and sleep, or to seek companionship. It 
would be to ignore the very force of the child’s being. 
It would fail to take account of and would allow to operate 
at random the most fundamental conditions of life and de- 
velopment. To restrain or suppress them would be ana- 
logous to impairing the digestion and restricting respira- 
tion and circulation. It would retard or check growth 
and result in a dwarfed individual. To indulge the im- 
pulses and perpetuate the interests of the child must pro- 
duce the same result in another way. Instead of there 
being a progressive development, there will be a tendency 
to fix and make permanent interests and modes of activ- 
ity that should be only transitory. It must be recognized 
that the normal interests and impulses of childhood are 
good, but that some of them have only a temporary value. 
If properly utilized they not only serve important present 
needs in the child, but prepare the way for future de- 
velopment. Others, such as the social impulse, the con- 
structive impulse, and the art impulse should be per- 
petuated and strengthened. 
This, then, is surely the answer to the question asked 
a moment ago, what shall we do with these impulses 
and interests of childhood? The impulses are essential 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  54 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
elements of life, differentiated, developed, and strengthened 
as the race has evolved. If there is to be growth and de- 
velopment in the individual the impulses must have ex- 
pression. The transient interests of childhood are es- 
sential to the expression of the impulses. Hence these 
interests should be utilized, each in its proper time, to 
serve as the means of reaching the next stage in the 
progress of the child’s development. 
In conclusion, how can the impulses to activity gen- 
erally, the impulse to get sensation, to motor activity, to 
play, to imitate, to construct, to experiment, to work, the 
social impulse, the impulse to art expression, how can 
each and all of these be utilized in carrying on the edu- 
cative process? Is there any better way than through vari- 
ous forms of manual occupations? What was a necessity 
to primitive peoples, and has been to a large extent with the 
whole race should be a well-ordered opportunity for the 
girls and boys whom new conditions tend to exclude from 
both the necessity and the opportunity,

Importance of Sense Training.—Attention has been 
called to the fact that the exercise and consequent de- 
velopment of the sense powers are fundamental impulses 
in the life process. If this position be accepted .the 
question for the educator is: What methods of exercise 
will give fullest expression to these impulses, and best 
development to the powers? This question cannot be 
answered without a brief glance backward. 
Comenius appears to have been the earliest writer on 
formal education to emphasize the importance of giving 
special attention to the training of the senses. 
“The ground of this business is, that sensual 
(sensuous) objects be rightly presented to the senses 
for fear they may not be received. I say, and say it 
again aloud, that this is the foundation of all the 
rest; because we can neither act nor speak wisely, 
unless we first rightly understand all the things which 
are to be done and whereof we have to speak. Now 
there is nothing in the understanding which was not 
before in the senses. And therefore to exercise the 
senses well about the right perceiving of the differ- 
55  
-P-A-G-E-58
  56 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
ences of things will be to lay the grounds for wisdom 
and all wise discourse, and all discreet actions in one’s 
course of life, which, because it is commonly neg- 
lected in schools, and the things that are to be learned 
are offered to scholars without their being under- 
stood or being rightly presented to the senses, it 
cometh to pass that the work of teaching and learn- 
ing goeth heavily onward and offereth little benefit.”* 
Rousseau followed in much the same strain, and sug- 
gested a special search for materials upon which to train 
the senses during the early years. He thinks it most 
unreasonable that a child under twelve years of age 
should be expected to exercise reason or judgment. 
“The first faculties which are formed in us are 
the senses. These then are the first which should 
be cultivated; but these are the very ones that we 
forget or that we neglect the most. We can neither 
touch, nor see, nor hear, except as we are taught.” ? 
Even our usually cautious, conservative, English 
friends have laid special stress upon this phase of de- 
velopment. Under “Training of the Senses” Sully writes: 
“A more systematic procedure can be gradually 
introduced, aiming at an accurate and full knowl- 
edge of the several sense-elements. Thus in training 
the color sense, the educator may best proceed by 
*Comenius. “Preface to Orbis Pictus.” 
* Rousseau. “Emile.”
-P-A-G-E-59
  SENSE-TRAINING a7: 
selecting first of all a few bright and striking colors 
as white, red, and blue. Each of these must be made 
familiar and its name learned. After being shown 
separately they should be shown in juxtaposition. ... 
When a few elements have thus been thoroughly 
learned, new ones may be added.” * 
Further, under the heading, “The Object Lesson,” he 
writes: 
“After the exercise of the child in the perception 
of form comes the training of the senses as a whole 
in the knowledge of objects and their constituent 
qualities. The systematic development of this side 
of the training of the senses gives us the object 
lesson....The object-lesson aims at nothing be- 
yond the training of the observing powers them- 
selves,” 1 
Further evidence may be found in still more recent 
writings : 
“The teacher who tries to train the powers of 
judgment and reasoning upon incomplete and inac- 
curate sense-perception is like the man who built his 
house upon the sand. The wise teacher endeavors 
to build up the intellectual edifice upon the rock of 
well-ordered sense-percepts.” 
“In giving a lesson on copper, one teacher deals 
be *Sully. “Teacher’s Handbook of Psychology,” pp. 104, 127, 
129. 4
-P-A-G-E-60
  58 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
with the color and then passes on to some such topic 
as the the method of obtaining the ore, thus appealing 
to one sense only, sight. Another teacher not only 
lets the child look at the copper, but lets him feel it, 
bend it, put his tongue to it, strike it, thus appealing 
to the sense of touch, muscularity, taste, and hear- 
mpge: 
Indeed, apart from supplying some unorganized in- 
formation, the whole theory of object-lessons as they pre- 
vailed in the schools of America and Europe a quarter 
of a century ago was based in part upon this idea that 
a height of power and alertness in sense discrimination 
is of prime importance to the young child, and that such 
ability is best developed by a course of training through 
special exercises. 
Substitutes for Object-Lessons.—Though the futil- 
ity of object-lessons has been generally recognized and 
the practice of giving such lessons generally abandoned 
in all the more progressive schools the disease, of which 
they were only a symptom, still prevails in many places. 
The eruption appears in various forms. Among some 
teachers it is plain, simple sense-training exercises. The 
children stand with their backs to the piano while some 
one strikes a key and the children try to guess, or judge, 
* Dexter & Garlick. “Psychology in the Schoolroom,” pp. 
99. 101.
-P-A-G-E-61
  SENSE-TRAINING 59 
what key has been struck. Cards or beads of various 
shades and tints of color are given to be assorted. 
The writer not long ago saw an alleged lesson in sense- 
training in art. A very bright, enthusiastic teacher had a 
class of forty or fifty children from seven to eight years 
of age. She stood before the class and held in her hands 
a number of cards about six by eight inches in size. Upon 
each card was mounted a cheap reproduction of some fam- 
ous work of art. A picture was flashed before the children 
for from two to five seconds and then removed. The chil- 
dren were expected to name the picture and the artist, and 
they did it with surprising readiness and precision. What 
was the value of it all? “What fools we mortals be.” 
Among another group of teachers, the disease breaks 
out, and becomes very infectious as “visualization” or as 
an alleged system of “mind training.” All sorts of ex- 
ercises and games are devised to provide practice in taking 
mental snap shots of the form, size, color, and number of 
objects, pictures, or hieroglyphic symbols. It is the easiest 
thing in the world to create a high degree of abnormal in- 
terest in this sort of exercise. Only teachers of enthu- 
siasm are likely to undertake it. The enthusiasm infects 
the children, and the activities involved are so superficial, 
and so gently graded, that the majority of children seem 
to succeed well in them. A spirit of intense emulation 
prevails and some children soon become very expert in 
the exercises. It is easy to test results and the method
-P-A-G-E-62
  60 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
lends itself to public demonstrations as only superficial 
work can. For these same reasons the method becomes 
epidemic for a time among a certain class of teachers who 
are especially susceptible to that kind of infection. 
The First Problem.—The reasons for this special 
emphasis of sense-training are, perhaps, sufficiently in- 
dicated in the citations from various authors just quoted. 
To restate them briefly we may say the senses are re- 
garded as the only outer gateways of knowledge. They 
bear to the mind the same relation that the mouth bears 
y to the stomach. They are the only avenues through which 
/ the mind can get its raw material. Hence the more alert 
and active they become the more raw material the mind 
will have to work over into organized knowledge. Then 
it has been recognized that the sense powers may be de- 
veloped to a much higher degree than is usual ; that in the 
blind the sense of touch and of hearing become peculiarly 
acute because special demands are made of them; that 
persons engaged in certain occupations acquire the ability 
to make sense discriminations utterly beyond the appre- 
ciation of others. Moreover, success in many occupations 
depends upon the possession and exercise of some su- 
perior sense power. Then, if we grant, as I think we 
must, that the senses can be rendered especially active 
by means of special exercises devised for that purpose 
alone, it must appear that such training is a proper and 
commendable phase of education. Is it not highly de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
SENSE-TRAINING 61 
sirable that the gleaners of the fundamental elements of 
all knowledge should be made as active and efficient as 
possible, and that every child should have the fullest pos- 
sible training of those powers that are directly necessary 
to success in so many of the practical occupations of 
life? Can there be any reasonable objection to such 
methods of training? 
An Important Distinction—Our effort to find an 
answer to these questions involves enquiry as to other 
possible methods of sense-training, and then a compari- 
son of such methods with those above described. We 
shall find these methods by considering how sense power 
has been developed where these special, direct methods 
have not been employed. How has the race evolved its 
powers of sense discrimination? How does the blind 
man acquire his acute sense of hearing and of touch? 
How do men learn to grade lumber, or paper, or 
textiles with such precision and rapidity that their 
work is bewildering to the untrained onlooker? 
How has the painter learned to mix his col- 
ors? It is evident that the distinction between the 
mode of training that has produced skill in these per- 
sons, and that of the direct method employed in some of 
the schools, lies in the purpose of the activity employed 
and in the consequent attitude of the person concerned. 
In the direct method, where there are specially devised 
school exercises, the discrimination of sense qualities is  
-P-A-G-E-64
  62 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
made an end itself, while in the indirect method, certain 
discriminations are necessary in order to the accomplish- 
ment of some end of direct personal interest to the one 
concerned. When one is trying to learn to sing a melody 
he has an immediate vital interest in discriminating the 
pitch, force, and quality of the different tones. If he has 
difficulty in getting a certain interval he is directly in- 
terested in hearing it played or sung over and over again 
until he can not only apprehend the distinction with the ear 
but can reproduce it with the vocal organs. When one 
wants to paint a tulip he must observe closely the form 
and relative position of the leaves and the differences in 
shade and tint, and his attitude toward the work is essen- 
tially different from that involved in assorting leaves or 
cards according to their shape or color, merely for the 
sake of showing that he can sort them. 
Relative Values.—The relative values of the direct 
and indirect methods of developing sense powers may be 
clearly seen from several points of view. 
First—Let us consider it from the point of view of 
evolution. How have the powers of sense discrimina- 
tion been differentiated and evolved? There seems only 
one answer to this question. It has been through exer- 
cise prompted by impulse and conditioned by the felt needs 
of the organism. The wolf, the fox, and the hunting dog 
scent their prey at great distances. The rabbit and the 
deer have large mobile ear-trumpets to enable them to
-P-A-G-E-65
  SENSE-TRAINING 63 
get warning of the approach of possible enemies. The 
hawk, flying high, has a clear eye for possible food sup- 
ply upon the ground beneath. The Indian hunter discerns 
the call, or sees the track of certain game where the or- 
dinary man distinguishes nothing by either hearing or 
sight. The sailor forecasts the weather by slight changes 
in the appearances of the far-off horizon, and detects the 
dangerous shoal by shades in the water unseen by the 
landsman. The miller’s apprentice soon learns to grade 
different qualities of flour by the sense of touch, because 
that is part of his business. When the hunger of ‘the 
wolf has been satisfied neither his nose nor his ear is 
alert. The sailor walking through the fields or woods, 
is likely to notice nothing of the flora about him. The 
miller whose finger tips are so sensitive to flour may be 
a very poor judge of cotton, woolen, or silk textiles. In 
all the course of normal development and evolution it 
does not appear that there is necessity or provision for 
special exercises for sense-training. 
The development of the color sense among oriental 
peoples illustrates this point. Van Dyke says: 
“It is said that the people of India are able to 
perceive three hundred different shades of color not 
perceptible to European eyes, and it cannot be 
doubted that their years of association with varied 
hues has trained them to.this keenness of vision. The 
detection of beauty in color is not a thing that can  
-P-A-G-E-66
64 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
be argued or learned from a book. As the handler 
of silk educates the sense of touch and the musician 
and the poet the sense of hearing, so the artist de- 
velops the sense of sight without rule or reason, and 
oftentimes quite unconsciously.” + 
Second.—The foregoing line of thought suggests an 
essential difference in the emotional attitude involved in 
the exercise of the senses as a means of attaining some 
desired end and in that where the sense-discrimination is 
the end in itself. In the first case the interest is directly 
in the qualities observed, as when one mixes colors 
in painting, or tests the smoothness of a piece of wood 
or metal he is polishing, or tunes a violin, or by taste or 
smell tests a substance for the development of an acid. 
In the second case the interest is indirect, is transferred 
from something else. The thing is done to please a sym- 
pathetic teacher, or to get through with it, or to excel 
classmates, or because the immediate social environment 
seems to make it a necessary part of the daily duty. 
In the case of direct sense training the interest is 
indirect and the discriminations are more purely intel- 
lectual, while in indirect sense training the interest is 
direct and the intellectual activity is set going and borne 
along by a more or less strong emotional force. 
The importance of this contrast cannot be over estima- 
ted. This is so because this direct interest, this emotional 
*John C. Van Dyke, “How to Judge a Picture,” p. 29.  
-P-A-G-E-67
  SENSE-TRAINING 65 
attitude toward a personal end lies at the base of all 
rational activity. Through it the individual sets up his 
standard of what is “‘worth-while.” Things that are done 
merely as assigned tasks and those done simply from in- 
direct interest are all on the same plane of values, so 
that there can be no comparison of values, no judgment 
of “worth-whileness,” hence nothing that makes this ac- 
tivity rational and that irrational. 
Third —Again it seems quite fair to infer that the 
character of the resultant will essentially differ in the 
two cases. It is a well known psychological fact that 
strong emotional disturbances produce distinct chemical 
and physiological effects upon the organism. Good 
humor is commonly believed to aid digestion. Intense 
excitement is usually followed by fatigue and weakness, 
often headache. Apparently authentic cases are reported 
of the death of infants due to poison generated in the 
milk of the mothers who have given away to furious 
anger. By analogy it may reasonably be inferred that 
when the sense organs are exercised with a favorable 
emotional accompaniment there will be a more normal 
kind of development, the effect will be more organic and 
hence deeper and more permanent. This view will ac- 
count for the fact that the results of special sense-train- 
ing usually appear so superficial and evanescent, while 
sense power developed through indirect methods are so 
deep-seated and abiding. A man who in early years had
-P-A-G-E-68
  66 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
been inspector of woolen fabrics in a large wholesale 
dry goods house and afterwards spent twenty-five years 
in a quite different occupation said he believed his tactile 
sensibility for woolen textiles of like manufacture had 
lost little of its acuteness. Another who had learned 
the blacksmith trade testified that, after twenty years 
spent as a traveling salesman, the different tints in the 
heated iron were as clear and full of meaning to him as 
when he was working at the trade. 
Fourth—Another difference between the two modes 
of sense-training in schools is found in the comparative 
isolation of a special sense to be exercised by the direct 
method, and then the over emphasis of attention to cer- 
tain arbitrarily selected qualities. One aspect of the error 
in this point of view is admirably expressed in the fol- 
lowing: 
“Underlying the sense-training is the recognition 
of the evolution of the differentiated senses out of 
one sense as an advance in power. From this 
foundation has developed much of the emphasis 
which has been thrown upon exercises devised to 
strengthen one form of sense-perception at a time. 
This accentuation of the functioning of one sense 
is opposed to the generally accepted doctrine of 
nervous function. The attempt to train the senses 
systematically in isolation gives rise to many exer- 
cises which seem to endeavor to narrow the -wide
-P-A-G-E-69

SENSE-TRAINING 67 
range of adjustments which are not only possible 
but desirable. The various kinds of images that are 
involved in a single perception show the futility, if 
not the wastefulness, of effort directed toward a 
conscious differentiation of the senses. It is true 
that the seafaring man has a training of the sight 
which enables him to distinguish vessels at a dis- 
tance which would make them invisible to a land- 
lubber ; that the practiced ear of a Theodore Thomas 
will detect in one instrument the slightest variation 
from the standard in tone or time of that set for 
a hundred instruments in his orchestra, that one 
particular sense acts as a fundamental in this or that 
trade or profession.” * 
The following shows clearly another evil of the 
method: 
“Another child who has been drilled in recogniz- 
ing colors apperceives the shades of color to the 
neglect of all else. The professor of the new psych- 
ology wants sixty-four shades of color taught to 
his infant child, as if to finish up that phase of 
training of the senses once for all. How fine to have 
the child able to recognize sixty-four shades of 
color! 
A third child, exclusively trained in form studies 
*Ella F. Young, “Some Types of Modern Educational Theo- 
Ty, op. o/.
-P-A-G-E-70
  68 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
by the constant use of geometric solids and much 
practice in looking for the fundamental geometric 
forms lying at the basis of the multi-farious objects 
that exist in the world, will, as a matter of course, 
apperceive geometric forms, ignoring the other 
phases of objects.” ? 
It is clearly not the function of the elementary school 
to give that kind of special sense-training which is neces- 
sary to the musician or painter or to the expert in any 
occupation. That is a form of technical education which 
properly belongs to special schools or colleges, just as 
much as training in pharmacy, architecture, or journal- 
ism. It is the proper work of the elementary school to 
promote the process of the all round development of 
the child, without attempting to develop a high degree 
of skill in any one thing. The aim should be rather to 
leave the powers in a plastic or fluid condition which ad- 
mits of further growth, because just as soon as ideas, 
modes of attention, or other habits, become set and fixed 
further growth and education is correspondingly retarded. 
Summary.—To sum up this discussion; direct or 
special sense-training is artificial, deals with specially 
selected materials; is intellectual but not emotional; is 
superficial, tending to inhibit rather than promote think- 
ing, and to establish habits of merely superficial obser- 
vation. On the other hand indirect sense-training is

SENSE-TRAINING 69 
not only the normal method of the individual in the 
practical affairs of life; but it is the phylogenetic method 
by which all sense powers have been evolved; involves 
a direct emotional factor as well as the intellectual; ad- 
mits of logical activities; has a more favorable biologic 
effect upon the organism; has deeper and more perma- 
nent results; is a general preparation for all possible 
subsequent activity and growth. 
Sense-Training Through Manual Industries—The 
case is so clear, that it seems like pointing a moral to 
call attention to the conclusion that “manual arts and in- 
dustries” furnish a better means of developing the sense 
powers than any system of specially devised exercises. 
The actual manipulation of various materials, clay, sand, 
papers, cardboards, woods, metals, cottons, wools, silks, 
materials that are being worked over for the sake of 
some end in which the tactile qualities must be appre- 
ciated, supplies all the conditions for desirable training 
of the sense of touch. Along with these will go training 
in visual perception which, however,:will have special 
emphasis in those occupations involving color, light and 
shade, details of form and proportion. Another ac- 
companiment will be the training of the muscular sense 
in judging weight, pressure, and other forms of force. 
The other intellectual sense, hearing, will be appealed to 
much less than touch and sight, but in working wood and 
metals especially there will always be more or less ear

exercise which has its own signficance in the operations. 
It is not implied that this kind of training develops the 
special expert sense of touch necessary in certain trades 
or professions. Such training in what corresponds with 
the public school state of the child’s development, “is 
undesirable, because, as has already been pointed out, 
- it tends to set in fixed habits, modes of activity that 
should remain fluid for later adaptations. To those who 
need it, this expert training should be given in the tech- 
nical or industrial trades schools, which must logically 
follow the general introduction of manual industries into 
,elementary schools.

  CHAPTER V 
Tue DEVELOPMENT OF Motor ContTRoL 
In Chapter III reference was made to the impulse 
to motor activity which manifests itself in all normal 
children. It is doubtful if the true significance of this 
impulse in the child has ever been fully appreciated in 
any scheme of formal education. In the fullness of the 
young child’s activities it is obvious to the most casual 
observer that the sensori-motor forms largely predomi- 
nate over the reflective. During his waking hours it is 
a matter of common remark that the child is never still 
a minute. We wonder at his endurance. Occasionally 
he stops to think, and gradually these partial inhibitions 
of the physical activity for the reflective become more 
and more frequent until in later life, with most persons, 
the reflective forms of activity exceed the sensori-motor. 
If we conceive of the whole volume of sensori-motor 
and reflective activities of life as represented by a cylin- 
der the relation between the two parts might be illus- 
trated as in the accompanying diagram. There will be 
from the first a small central core of reflective activity 
in a large medium of physical activity. In a normal 
development of the individual the. reflective life will 
gradually enlarge and the sensori-motor modes of activity 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    72 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
will relatively decrease. This does not mean that the two 
forms of activity are separate and independent. The 
fact is, they are inter-related and mutually dependent. 
Sensori-motor Activity 
    
    Sensori-motor Activity. 
Two Errors.—In this connection the fundamental 
errors of school education have been, first, lack of a 
proper estimate of the relative volume of each of the 
two modes of activity, and second, a failure to appre- 
ciate the fact that the change of proportions is a matter 
of imperceptibly gradual growth. 
Improvement.—During the past few years condi- 
tions in this respect have improved greatly. The teach- 
ings of Froebel, extending quite beyond direct kinder- 
garten schools, have done much to relieve the shock 
which the young child of a generation ago must have 
felt when he passed from the free, physically active 
life of the home to the restraining, constraining environ- 
ment of the school room. But the problem is far from 
being solved. The abruptness of the change demanded 
has been reduced but by no means entirely removed.
-P-A-G-E-75
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL i 
Where there are kindergarten schools the sudden transi- 
tion required often comes between the kindergarten and 
the primary school, instead of, as formerly, between the 
home and the school. The shock and consequent re- 
tardation of growth which the seedling plant suffers 
when transplanted is typical, in a very small way, of the 
interruption of growth and waste of time and energy 
of the child, caused by abrupt breaks in the continuity 
of his life experiences. 
Influence of Child Study.—If child study has estab- 
lished any one practical principle in education more 
clearly than another it is that in the elementary school 
the impulse to motor activity must be more fully utilized. 
The activity does not need to be developed. It already 
exists in predominating proportions. If we think of life 
as activity plus the power of adaptation to the end of 
the growth and development of the organism we shall 
see that the function of formal education in regard to 
motor activity must be to increase its power of adapta- 
tion, in other words, to blend with the activity the element 
of rational control. This is a psychological as well as a 
physiological problem. 
Immediate Problem.—This division of our subject 
is so large, involves so many ramifications and has come 
to occupy so important a place in educational discussions, 
that it could not be treated adequately within the limits 
of an ordinary volume, much less within a single chapter.
-P-A-G-E-76
74 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
For this reason only some of the essential aspects of the 
subject, vitally connected with our general subject, 
manual occupations, will engage our attention. With 
this purpose in mind we posit the following elements as 
“basal-in the development of motor control; the impulse 
to motor activity, under the guidance of attention, oper- 
ating through nerve and muscle. From the outside we 
may estimate the degree of motor control along three 
lines: accuracy of the movements, uniformity and 
steadiness in continued motor activity, rapidity of execu- 
A tion. Our immediate problems are: Do manual occu- 
pations tend to develop motor control? If so, how and 
to what extent? 
Experiments in Sawing.—To get a body of original 
data upon which to base our attempt to answer these 
questions, some simple experiments were undertaken. 
In general the activities involved in manual occupations 
are too complex to afford satisfactory material for ex- 
perimental work. Three conditions are essential. The 
activities must admit of comprehensive observation. 
They must be amenable to a reasonable degree of control 
of the conditions involved. The results must be capable 
of accurate estimation. For these reasons the first series 
of experiments consisted in sawing cuts one inch deep 
jn a narrow strip of inch board. The experiments were 
performed in accordance with the following directions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 75 
Tools: An ordinary handsaw without a back, try- 
square, rule, pencil, vise. 
Material: Pieces of dressed pine 12” x2” x 1”. 
1. From end to end upon each wide face of the 
board, draw a line one inch from the same 
narrow face. 
2. Beginning one inch from the end, upon the nar- 
row face referred to above, mark 20 points 
exactly % inch apart. 
3. Through these points rule lines across the nar- 
row face at right angles to the edges. 
4. From the extremities of these cross lines draw 
lines at right angles to the long lines and 
ending in them. 
5. Place the board in a vise and saw 20 cuts one 
inch deep from the narrow face, about 1/32 
inch to the right of the guide lines. Those   using the left hand will saw a like distance to 
the left of the guide lines. None of the pencil 
marks should be cut. 
6. Children under 13 years of age will saw only 
10 cuts a day, other persons 20 cuts a day. 
The whole series may be doné at once, or in 
equal parts at an interval of one hour. 
7. Each person should continue to practice until 
he can saw straight cuts three times out of 
four. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78

76 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
8. The date, the hour, and the number of seconds 
taken for the work, should be written under 
the group of cuts made at one time. 
9. If possible, notes should be made of the changes 
in the attitude of the mind toward the work 
from time to time. 
The Subjects.—In the first series of sawing experi- 
ments there were six subjects, four men and two women, 
all young well-matured adults, with considerable experi- 
ence in experimental work. All were right handed, but 
to make the exercise as nearly de novo as possible, each 
used only the left hand in sawing. 
No. 1 is a professor in the Department of Psychology, 
University. of Chicago, a man who does everything with 
exceeding care. At the outset left hand manipulations 
were performed with great effort. 
No. 2, a professor in the same department, is also 
a careful worker. To him left hand co-ordinations 
seemed at the start somewhat easier than for No. 1. , 
No. 3 is a woman graduate student. For some days 
before taking the exercises she had been constructing 
some apparatus that required considerable sawing. To 
rest her right hand she had done some sawing with the 
left, and so had acquired a degree of skill in left hand 
sawing to begin with. 
No. 4, also a woman graduate student, had done 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 77 
considerable sawing, but the left hand work was to her 
entirely new. 
No. 5, a graduate student, laid special stress upon 
precision. 
No. 6, also a graduate student, aimed to combine 
“speed with accuracy from the first. 
The first four sawed ten cuts, and after an interval 
of an hour the other ten of that day’s exercise. Nos. 
5 and 6 sawed the twenty cuts each day without a rest. 
All the exercises for each subject were taken at about 
the same time each day, between three and five o’clock 
in the afternoon. Except in the case of No. 4 the prac- 
tice was taken as nearly as possible on consecutive days. 
The work of No. 4 was purposely done at longer and 
less regular intervals. 
Objectively, it was evident the attempt to set up 
new co-ordinations required unusual effort. There was 
a high degree of rigidity throughout the whole body, the 
legs were set as braces, the right hand grasped tightly 
the piece of wood being sawed, the mouth was usually 
set, and the eyes watched closely the progress of the 
work. The last named condition was especially noticea- 
ble in those who made the practice most effective. In 
other words, the more concentrated the attention the 
more rapid the development of control. 
The accuracy of each cut was quantified by means of 
a specially prepared millimeter scale. The possible value 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  78 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
of each cut was 10 points, 2 for the horizontal direction, 
3 on each side for the vertical direction, and one on each 
side for precision in cutting just to the limiting line. 
One point was deducted for each deviation of a milli- 
meter from the guiding line. 
The following table shows the day of the month on 
which each exercise was taken, the estimated accuracy 
of each cut, and the time, in seconds, for each cut. 
No. 5 made very little progress in accuracy, in fact 
he reached the maximum in that respect on the first 
day, but it will be noticed that he worked very slowly 
until the last day when he was reminded that in the end 
the time element was of distinct importance. Then he 
showed he could very much lower the time without 
sacrificing accuracy. 
The exceptional record of No. 4 is suggestive because 
there appeared to be no other reason for the lack of im- 
provement than the irregularly long intervals between the 
periods of practice. 
The significance of the results of this series can be 
seen at a glance from the accompanying chart. The 
accuracy curve has risen steadily with only one deflection 
from 61 to nearly 82 and the time curve has fallen, 
abruptly at first, and then steadily from 300 to 110,

DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 81 
A New Problem.—The introspections reported indi- 
cated a varying sense of uncertain struggle, with decided 
fatigue at the end of each test, gradually giving place to 
confidence and comparative ease. 
At the end of the six days’ practice all except No. 6 
felt they could saw as well with the left hand as with the 
right. There remained, however, one common disability, 
a pronounced tendency to grip the saw handle, with the 
result that the hand, and more especially the fingers, were 
fatigued in from two to three minutes, though the general 
bodily tension and the unnecessary strain in the arm had 
disappeared. : 
It then appeared possible that this element, gripping 
the instrument, might be vital to the whole matter of 
manual motor control. A new problem had arisen; to 
devise some method of measuring the force with which 
the instrument is grasped in different stages of the 
process of gaining such control. 
The Dynamometric Sawhandle.—After considerable 
experimenting a sawhandle was constructed involving 
the principle of the hand dynamometer. The essential 
feature of this handle is that the part grasped by the 
hand is made of a heavy piece of rubber tubing suffi- 
ciently reinforced to secure a satisfactory balance be- 
tween the degree of strength and rigidity necessary to 
resist the push and pull effort of sawing, and the degree 
of sensitiveness to the gripping of the fingers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  82 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
The construction is shown in Fig. 1. The bottom 
of the tube constituting the hand grasp was closed by a 
rubber stopper cemented in to make it water-tight. Into 
the upper end of the rubber tube was inserted and 
cemented a brass tube which extended upward through 
the wood of the handle. To this brass tube a small, 
rather firm rubber tube was attached, the other end being 
connected with a tambour adjusted to register upon an 
ordinary kymograph.    
Fic. 2—Shows cross section of dynamometric saw handle. 4A, 
stiff rubber tube; B, reinforcing rubber tube; C, space filled 
with water; D, brass tube; E, small rubber tube filled with 
air; F, water-tight plug. 
A Precaution.—Before using the apparatus each day 
the cavity C in the handle was filled with water at about 
100° Fah. to prevent much variation in temperature due 
to heat from the hand. The temperature of the room 
was kept as nearly as possible at 70° to prevent expansion 
or contraction of the air in the apparatus. This precau-
-P-A-G-E-85
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 83 
tion was necessary because it was found that a rise or 
fall of one’ or two degrees in the temperature of the air 
of the room resulted in a considerable movement of the 
pointer. - 
The Subjects.—Ten subjects took the exercises with 
this saw, eight boys from twelve to thirteen years of age, 
one professor (No. 1 of the first group of subjects), 
and one graduate student. Only six of the boys com- 
pleted the regular series, sawing ten cuts a day for six 
days. All these boys were right handed and used only 
the right hand in sawing the series. All except No. 11 
had had considerable manual training. 
No. 7, rather underdeveloped physically, below normal 
in coordinating power and in continuity of attention. 
No. 8, weil developed, stocky, attentive, careful and 
persistent in effort. 
No. 9, very tall, slight, rather below normal in mus- 
cular development, intellectual rather than motor, but 
painstaking in effort. 
No. 10. well developed, has good motor control, but is 
a little impulsive. 
No. 11, underdeveloped, weak in both mental and 
physical control, attention wandering. 
. No. 12, slightly undersize, but in fair physical condi- 
tion, very impulsive and spasmodic. 
Table II shows the results for each boy, and Chart 
IT the average result for the group.

For each of these six subjects, as well as for the 
others of the groups, records were taken on the kymo- 
graph showing the degree of, and fluctuations in, the 
hand grip during the progress of the exercise. Plate I 
gives typical examples of the records of the work of the 
boys sawing with the right hand. To interpret the

work was done. 
The numbers correspond with those used in Table II. 
No. 7 exercised, for the most part, a comparatively 
light grip but occasionally put in a spasmodic effort. 
The whole may be described as below the average in 
muscular tension and decidedly irregular. So far as 
could be judged attention and interest ran in much the 
same irregular way as the curve of muscular tension 
shown here. His gain in control was slow. 
No. 8 applied steadily a quite firm grip, and watched 
the work with close attention. By referring to Table II 
it will be seen he attained the highest record in accuracy 
and a good time record. 
No. 9 worked easily and steadily. The slight rise in 
this curve, and that more marked in 10 and 14, was 
probably due to temperature change rather than increased 
pressure. 
No. 10 applied about the same pressure as No. 8, but 
worked with more vigor, hence the increased amplitude 
of the push and pull wave. 
No. 11 was as feeble as his tracing indicates. . There 
was little energy, little attention, little progress. 
No 12 worked with much vigor, but with some irreg- 
ularity. His ordinary activities were commonly as im- 
pulsive as these tracings indicate his sawing to have been. 
No. 13 lacked attention and tension in his effort. His

progress in the development of motor control was always 
slow. 
No. 14 had’ unusual control of the use of tools, and 
worked with ease and steadiness. His attention accom- 
panying constructive activities lacked nothing in con- 
centration or continuity. 
A third series of exercises was even more interesting 
and perhaps equally significant. These exercises were 
taken for the sake of comparing the extent and kind of 
effort involved in sawing with the right hand and with 
the left hand. The results are clear in Plate II. In every 
case when the change is made from right to left hand 
there is a distinct rise in the curve and marked increase 
in the irregularity, implying at least twice the energy in 
the hand and a marked deficiency in control. 
In the case of those to whom the left hand exercise 
was entirely new the discharge of energy manifested itself 
throughout the whole body. There was general rigidity 
of the trunk and limbs, the unused hand was clenched, 
the mouth was set (open or closed), the right arm ac- 
companied the left in the push and pull movement, even 
the breathing was explosive. The whole activity was an 
exemplification of what Baldwin calls the “excess dis- 
charge” which attends the setting up of new co-ordina- 
tions. The tracings are, for the hand, graphic records 
of what was taking place throughout the whole motor 
system.

DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 91 
As the practice continued this difference between the 
energy in the right ‘and left hand work almost entirely 
disappeared. It was nearly two months from the time 
No. 1 took the first series of exercises until he took 
his second series. At the beginning of the second series 
he felt that his left hand had lost nearly all its power to 
control the saw. In three practice periods of the second 
series, that is, in half the original amount of practice, 
  Plate III. 
  it regained all it had lost. Plate II] shows how nearly 
the left hands had attained to equal ease and control 
with the right on the fifth day’s practice in the second 
series. None of the boys in the brief practice given at- 
tained the same degree of relative skill and facility with 
the left hand as compared with the right. 
One other characteristic of many of the curves is 
worthy of note. There was a very pronounced rise when 
placing the saw and beginning the cut, then a quite 
regular but rapid fall. This was most marked in the 
cases of careful workers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  92 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
One boy, No. 9, took a series of exercises in boring 
with a brace and bit. A good brace with straight, firm 
bit adjustment, and a 3-inch bit were used. The material 
was a piece of 2x 4 inch clear pine, dressed on all sides. 
Lines one inch apart crossing one another at right angles 
were ruled on both of the wide faces so that the points 
of intersection on one face came directly opposite those 
on the others. The aim was to start the point of the bit 
on the point of intersection of two lines on one side and 
so guide the instrument in boring that the point of the bit 
would emerge on the opposite intersection point, and to 
do so as rapidly as possible. In other words, the purpose 
was to bore as straight and as rapidly as possible. Ten 
holes were bored in the forenoon and ten in the after- 
noon, as nearly as possible at ten and at three o’clock. 
The wood was fastened in a vertical position in a vise 
and was not moved during an exercise period. 
As will be readily understood this was a much more 
difficult operation than the sawing, especially the effort to 
control the up and down variations in the direction of the 
bit, as-the subject was not allowed to view the instru- 
ment from the side. The development of control, though 
less rapid than in the sawing exercise, was quite obviously 
regular and fairly rapid. There was a gain of nearly 
30% in both accuracy and time. The result is shown in 
Chart IIT.

  CHAPTER VI. 
DEVELOPMENT oF Motor Controt (Continued) 
Another Problem.—The experiments with the dyna- 
mometric saw suggested that the same line of investiga- 
tion might be applied to the development of motor con- 
trol in learning to write. 
A penholder was constructed involving the same prin- 
ciples as the dynamometric sawhandle. A piece of rather | 
rigid but thin brass tubing 14 inch in diameter and 3 
inches long was used as the foundation of the instrument. 
About %4 inch from one end the sides of this tube were 
filed away leaving only a narrow rib of metal about 
¥% inch wide at the front and back of the tube. These 
openings extended 1% inches up the tube, Fig. 2. 
Just below these openings the tube was sealed. The 
remaining whole sections of the tube top and bottom 
were covered with tight fitting rubber tubing cemented 
on and then a larger piece of rubber tubing 2% inches 
long was drawn over the whole from the bottom to within 
Y4 inches of the upper end. This was cemented to the 
under rubber. The lower end of the tube, below the 
plug, was left open for the purpose of fitting into it a 
pen, a short pencil or a piece of common school crayon 
as desired. The tube was then filled witha colored fluid 
and into it was inserted and sealed a glass tube of small 
94
-P-A-G-E-97
DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 95 
bore about 6 inches long. The colored fluid 
was forced up so as to be visible in the glass 
tube. A millimeter scale was adjusted to 
the glass tube so that the rise of the column 
of fluid could easily be read. 
This device gave a holder for pen, pencil 
or crayon, having the part where the fingers 
grasp the instrument collapsible, and the 
very slightest pressure was clearly indicated 
by a rise of the fluid in the tube. 
Minor Problems.—In the series of ex- 
periments in writing several problems ap- 
peared. 
1. Is there any relation between the 
tendency to grip the pen, pencil or crayon 
and the progress of development of motor 
control ? Q NY

resting on the desk, (b) with arm resting but the hand 
entirely unsupported, (c) with both hand and arm un- 
supported ? 
5. What is the relation between the tension exerted 
by young children, eight or nine years of age, as com- 
pared with that of children from twelve to thirteen? 
Test of Tension with or Without Rest.—In the first 
series of experiments in writing only a rather broad 
smooth pen of medium flexibility was used. The three 
methods of writing enumerated in problem (4) above 
were employed in the order given each for one minute 
of continuous writing with a brief rest interval between 
the successive tests. Six readings of the measure of ten- 
sion were taken during the minute, as nearly as possible 
at intervals of ten seconds. In cases where the subject 
seemed embarrassed by the unfamiliar instrument some 
preliminary practice was allowed before taking the test. 
Subsequently, similar tests were taken successively 
with a fine pointed pen, a broad soft pencil, a hard sharp 
pencil, and with a piece of ordinary crayon. The sub- 
jects were all boys, Nos. 9, 10 and 11, being the same 
as those in the sawing test. 
Table III gives the results of the five series of exer- 
cises. In the first series, for the purpose of showing 
the variations and general trend of the reading in each 
trial, the six readings for each subject are given in de- 
tail. Where the variation is very wide, it will be noticed 
that it is usually a fall as in No..15. This is accounted
-P-A-G-E-99
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 97 
for by the fact that these particularly low readings were 
taken at instants when the pen was off the paper and 
the tension consequently relaxed. On the other hand, 
there was an occasional spasmodic increase of tension 
especially by a subject of low motor development. These 
seem to represent impulsive struggles to get control. 
It will be understood, of course, that these readings 
are purely relative within the series of tests made; no 
attempt having been made to reduce them to standard 
units. 
As side lights upon the results of these experiments 
the ages of the subjects are given, and records of hand 
dynamometer and tapping tests are added. The strength 
of the grip of the hand is expressed in kilograms. The 
tapping tests were taken with an ordinary self-registering 
counter, having a rather stiff spring. The first record 
is the average for three successive trials of 10 seconds 
each, the second is for a minute trial. 
The next group of subjects comprised eight children, 
four being nine years of age and four eight years of age. 
“With the exception of No. 21, the eight-year-old children 
had had very little practice in writing, especially with 
pen or pencil. Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, represent girls 
and the other boys. These children were required to 
write successively with five different instruments as in- 
dicated at the head of Table IV. With each of the 
first four, they wrote in the three ways; namely, (1) 
with both hand and arm resting upon the desk, (2) with

  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 99 
the arm resting but the hand unsupported, (3) with both 
hand and arm unsupported. Then a fifth test was made 
in writing upon the blackboard. 
As in the preceding series six readings of the ten- 
sion were taken in each case, and the average has been 
placed in the table. The three lines of figures opposite 
each subject number represent the three modes of writing 
enumerated above. Comparing these three lines in each 
case it will be seen that free-arm writing involves less 
finger grip on the writing instrument than any other 
method, and that when the hand as well as the arm 
rests the tension is greatest. 
Similarly comparing the five columns, it will be seen 
that the easiest means of writing for these children was 
with crayon upon the blackboard, and that the muscular 
tension is much greater when writing with either a fine 
pen or a sharp, hard pencil than with a broad pen or 
broad, soft pencil. 
A final series of exercises was devised as a simple 
test of the relative fatigue resulting from five minutes 
continuous, rapid writing, first, with pen upon paper, and 
second, with crayon upon the blackboard. The matter 
written was in all cases a short sentence,and each subject 
wrote the same sentence in each test. All were instructed 
to write as rapidly as possible consistent with legibility. 
The dynamometer test was taken immediately before each 
writing exercise and again immediately after the writing. 
The results are given in Table V. :

utes continuous pen writing and five minutes blackboard writing. 
A comparison of the tables shows that the average loss in 
strength of hand-grip in the pen writing test was 2.88 kilograms 
while in the blackboard writing it was only 1.95 kilograms. In 
other words, the average fatigue from pen writing, for this 
group of children, was nearly fifty per cent more than from the 
blackboard writing. 
INFERENCES FROM THE WHOLE SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS 
I. Attention.—The first inference is that concen- 
trated attention is the fundamental factor in the devel- 
opment of motor control. This is based upon several 
observations : 
First, that without exception, in the practice exer- 
cises, the subjects who did the work with close and 
continuous attention to the thing in hand made most 
rapid progress in setting up new coordinations. 
Second, this was most marked in those who mani- 
festly had well established habits of attention.
-P-A-G-E-104
  102 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Third, in cases where attention seemed habitually 
weak and wayward there was a distinct contrast between 
the progress made when the work was performed in a 
more or less indifferent way, and that when even some 
transferred interest was applied to hold attention to the 
work in hand. 
Fourth, the length of time of practice and the number 
of repetitions of an act are vastly less important in devel- 
oping motor control than alert, concentrated attention. In- 
deed repetition that does not involve attention is rela- 
tively futile, so far as development is concerned. 
Fifth, all of the foregoing was equally true whether 
the subject was well or ill developed physically. This fact 
is well brought out in the cases of Nos. 11 and 16 in 
Table III. No. 11 is weak physically, and his attention, 
quite alert, is of that flitting sort which rarely focuses 
long enough to develop interest in the object. No. 16, 
on the other hand, is a big robust, muscular boy, 
whose apparent gross strength is not shown in the tests 
applied in these experiments. In manual work he was 
distinguished for the slow, awkward, clumsy way in 
which he destroyed materials. In other school work it 
was evident that his thinking was equally slow, clumsy, 
uncontrolled, and inefficient. He attained a fair degree of 
control in such activities as playing baseball, skating, and 
bicycle riding, where only the coarser adjustments were 
required. 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 103 
I am aware that this view is not in harmony with the 
conclusions of some other investigators. For example, 
Professor Bagley, who made some enquiry regarding the 
“Relation between Motor and Mental Ability,” claims to 
have found at least a well marked tendency to an inverse 
ratio between the motor development and the class stand- 
ing of a large number of children. The lack of harmony 
between his inference and mine may be more apparent 
than real. The fact that many children of good intellec- 
tual powers have not developed motor ability should not 
be taken as conclusive evidence that they are unable to 
develop it. They may not have had favorable oppor- 
tunities for motor development, may even have preferred 
intellectual to physical activity. Besides, it must not be 
forgotten that “class standing” may be a very unreliable 
criterion of mentality. What I have called an indication 
rather than a conclusion, does, however, seem to be. in 
harmony with the psychologic view of evolution. The 
first simple motor adjustment must have arisen in re- 
sponse to some conscious need of the organism and must 
have been brought about by a measure of active atten- 
tion. This simple statement represents the history of 
every new adjustment. There is a more or less conscious 
end to be attained and mind persistently attending, with 
some sort of image to imitate, finds the way to adjust 
the organism to the attainment of that end with economy 
of effort. While this is an entirely independent and
-P-A-G-E-106
104 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
original conclusion it,is not novel. At the close of his 
study of “Habit and Accommodation” Professor Bald- 
win says:1 
“Attention is the go-between between copy imi- 
tated and the imitation which copies it. It is, there- 
fore, the central and essential fact in all voluntary 
muscular control.” 
II. . Physical Vigor.—The second essential factor 
in the development of motor control is a healthful, 
vigorous physical organism. At one stage in the 
progress of the enquiry it looked as though this 
might be considered the prime condition, but as the 
enquiry proceeded the mental factor took the first 
place. That the degree of vigorous development of 
nerve and muscle is an important factor in the setting 
up of new coordinations, and developing easy control 
was, perhaps, most strongly indicated by the fact that 
in the experiments those subjects who made most rapid 
progress invariably exerted great efforts in the first at- 
tempts. As has already been pointed out, in referring to 
the sawing exercise, when a right hand subject first tried 
to saw with the left hand there was usually great nervous 
and musclar strain extending over wide areas, one might 
say, over the whole body. This was distinctly more 
marked in the case of those who rapidly developed con- 
trol. A few of the subjects, as the records show, notably 
  
‘J. M. Baldwin, “Mental Development,” page 474. 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 105 
No. 7 and No. 13, who are apparently up to the average 
in mentality but sub-normal physically, and No. 11, who 
is rather below normal in mental vigor and quite so in 
muscular development, only spasmodically grasped the 
instrument firmly. Even when the interest was apparently 
warm and the attention fairly concentrated and continu- 
ous they did not seem to have sufficient strength to make 
a vigorous effort except for a second or two at a time. 
When, as occasionally happened, a boy who usually 
worked with steady vigor, with the boy’s disposition to 
experiment on his own account, tried to see how lightly 
he could hold the sawhandle, there was a marked de- 
preciation in the control of the instrument and conse- 
quently in the character of his work. Nor ought the 
fact here pointed out to occasion surprise, when we recall 
the generally accepted theory of how new motor co- 
» ordinations are started. 
Professor Baldwin in his “Mental Development, 
‘Methods and Processes,” has reviewed earlier theories, 
and upon them, with much original material, constructed 
one of his own. The treatment is so elaborate that it is 
impossible to summarize it briefly, but a few quotations 
will serve to suggest his point of view. Discussing 
simple organic adaptation, he says: 
“A new stimulus can be accommodated to only 
within the limits inside of which the organ can pre- 
pare itself, on the basis of former-processes, to bring
-P-A-G-E-108
  106 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
about such a reaction as will tend to retain this 
kind of stimulus for itself. :This is accomplished, 
in the whole range of motor accommodations from 
the protozoa which swarm to the light to the most 
difficult feat of the acrobat, by what I may general- 
ize under the phrase ‘law of excess;’ it is an appli- 
cation within the organism of the principle upon 
which the natural selection of particular organisms 
is secured—the principle commonly known as ‘over- 
production.’ But, generally, the law of ‘excess’ may 
be stated somewhat as follows: the accommodation 
of an organism to a new stimulation is secured, 
apart from happy accidents, by the continued or 
repeated action of the stimulation, and this repetition 
is secured, not by the selection beforehand of this 
stimulation, nor by its fortuitous occurrence, alone, 
but by the proximate reinstatement of it by a dis- 
charge of the energies of the organism, concentrated 
as far as may be for the excessive stimulation of 
the organs most nearly fitted by former habit to get 
this stimulation again.” Page 179. 
Then, referring to the conditions of development 
that have become more complex, he says: 
“All the phenomena of consolidation or ‘down- 
ward growth,’ on the other hand, illustrate what is 
known as the law of ‘Habit;’ all the phenomena of 
specialization, or ‘upward growth,’ illustrate the law 
of Accommodation,
-P-A-G-E-109
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 107 
“As for Habit: Physiologically, habit means 
readiness for function, produced by previous exercise 
of the function. Anatomically, it means the arrange- 
ment of elements more suitably for a function, in 
consequence of former modifications of arrangement 
through that function. Psychologically, it means 
loss of oversight, diffusion of attention, subsiding 
consciousness. 
“As for Accommodation: Physiologically and 
anatomically, it means the breaking of a habit, the 
widening of the organic for the reception or accom- 
modation of new conditions. Psychologically, it 
means reviving consciousness, concentration of at- 
tention, voluntary control—the mental state which 
has its most general expression in what we know as 
Interest. In habit-and interest we find the psycho- 
logical poles corresponding to the lowest and the ‘ 
highest in the activities of the nervous system.” 
Page 292. 
Again, in the Chapter on Voluntary Attention, he 
writes: 
“In persistent imitation the first reaction is not 
repeated. Hence we must suppose the development 
of a function of coordination by which two regions 
excited respectively by the original suggestion and 
the reaction first made, coalesce in a common, more 
voluminous and intense stimulation of the motor 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
108 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
centre. A movement is thus produced which, by 
reason of its greater mass and diffusion, includes 
more of the elements of the movement seen and 
copied. This is again reported by eye or ear, giving 
a new excitement, which is again coordinated with 
the original stimulation and with the after-effects 
of the earlier imitations. The result is yet another 
motor stimulation or effort, of still greater mass and 
diffusion, which includes yet more elements of the 
‘copy.’ And so on, until simply by its increased 
mass, including the motor excitement of attention 
itselfi—by the greater range and variety of motor 
elements thus enervated—in short, by the excess dis- 
charge, the ‘copy’ is completely reproduced. The 
effort thus succeeds. 
“This, it is evident, is just the principle of ‘ex- 
cess,’ and it is very easy to find in it the origin of the 
attention. The attention is the mental function 
corresponding to the habitual motor coordination 
of the processes of heightened or ‘excess’ discharge. 
The exact elements which it includes have already 
been pointed out, and they will be spoken of again. 
“Let the child once withdraw attention from his 
copy, let him be distracted by bird or beast, and woe 
to his chance of learning the new movement. The 
whole conglomerate conscious content falls to pieces 
and he goes back to be a creature of suggestion.
-P-A-G-E-111
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 109 
But let him keep on attending—strongly, faithfully, 
well—and note his actions. His whole physical per- 
sonality gets concentrated in conjoint, then allied, 
then unified, then convulsive discharge upon the 
member which, by habit or previous use, is nearest 
to the copy requirement. He rolls his tongue, bites 
his lip, sways his body, works his legs, winks his 
eyes, etc., until every scheming nerve and tendon 
bends to do the task. His blood vessels, even, fill 
toward the hand he works with. This occurs only 
in attention, and this is the excess wave by which 
here in the highest consciousness, as there in the 
lowest organism, accommodation to new stimula- 
tions is secured.” Page 453. 
While this last was written with special reference to 
the development of attention, and it is a satisfaction to 
find my own inferences in harmony therewith, it is equally 
clear and strong in reference to the physical factors. 
Note, “every scheming nerve and tendcn bends to do the 
task.” If the nervous organization be not vigorous, or 
if the muscular system be not well developed, how can 
they ‘do the task” that makes such demands upon them? 
How can the new coordination be set up, the increased 
control be acquired? 
III. Strenuous Effort.—-From the above it follows 
that vigorous, energetic effort is essential in the early 
stages of the process of acquiring a neyy accommodation,
-P-A-G-E-112
  110 MANUAL ARIS AND INDUSTRIES 
and that the oft repeated admonition of the instructor to 
the young child struggling to acquire some new form of 
motor control, to “hold the pen easily,” to “let the saw run 
lightly,” to do the thing easily and not make such hard 
work of it, is wrong. The strenuous effort which the child 
makes is the short, direct line to the development of motor 
control. To insist upon a light grasp of the instrument is 
simply to retard progress in setting up the coordination. 
But, it will be urged, if the child be allowed to work with 
much tension he contracts a habit of working in that way, 
and all his subsequent exercise of that particular activity 
will be unnecessarily cramped and labored. - This idea has 
long been applied to training in writing with pen or 
pencil. The experiments indicate its limitations. 
Moreover, these results suggest another problem. Is 
there not danger in making the demand for a certain 
detailed and complex adaptation before the child is ready 
for it, in that the excessive energy must be kept up much 
longer than would be necessary at a later stage? In the 
experiments it was observed that in almost all cases the 
tension subsided as control developed, but that this rela- 
tion was less marked among the younger and relatively 
less mature children. The significance of this observa- 
tion was reinforced by another, viz.: that the tension in- 
creased with fatigue, and the testimony of many adults 
regarding their own writing confirms this observation. 
One little boy, Nq, 24, who appeared quite below normal
-P-A-G-E-113
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL i 
in motor control, after writing for a very short tin 
upon the blackboard, abandoned the free arm method, 
rested his hand against the blackboard, gripped the handle 
so as to send the fluid to the top of the tube, wrote a 
few letters and stopped from apparent lack of power to 
go on. The failure was partly due to the strangeness 
of the instrument with which he worked, because, in 
subsequent trials he maintained the free arm writing with 
fair success. The point is: Motor development proceeds 
gradually from large, simple_movements, to those that 
are finer and more complex. There is progressive prepar- 
ation for increasingly complex activities. To prematurely 
force a complex accommodation must interfere with the 
normal progress of development. This is important in its 
bearing upon training in handwriting: To require young 
children to write small letters with a fine pen or pencil is 
utterly wrong. 
IV. Value of Regularity in Practice—While it 
has been pointed out that in the progress of 
the development of motor control repetition is 
quite subordinate to attention, and that repetition of an 
act that does not require attention, or requires only a 
minimum of attention, is comparatively futile, it is not 
intended to underestimate the value of practice. The 
experiments were not primarily intended to show the 
development of the practice curve and the data is quite 
too meager for that purpose. All that can be said is that
-P-A-G-E-114
  112 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
the experiments seem to indicate that regularity and fre- 
quency of practice are important factors in the develop- 
ment of motor control. This was especially noticeable 
in the first series of sawing exercises, in which No. 4 
practiced at long irregular intervals, and, apparently for 
no other reason, made but little progress in either ac- 
curacy or rapidity. Some of the other cases tend to con- 
firm this indication. In the investigation there were some 
cases of desultory practice by children who attended 
irregularly. The results were too incomplete to include 
in the tables, and their only value was in the support 
they gave on the negative side to the importance of 
regularity and frequency in practice. 
V. Development in Large Nerves and Muscles 
First—Another point of some general significance is the 
apparent confirmation of the principle often alluded to 
by writers on development, and worked out with especial 
care by Burk,’ viz.: that development proceeds from 
fundamental to accessory in the nervous and muscular 
systems. One of the first observations made in the in- 
trospections of the subjects taking the sawing exercises 
with the left hand was that the fatigue was chiefly felt 
in the fingers. Even after a high degree of skill had been 
attained, it was commonly reported that the only remain- 
ing disability was the tendency to grip the instrument with 
the fingers, and a consequent fatigue in those members. 
‘Frederick Burk, Pedagogical Seminary, Vol. VI., pp. 5-64.
-P-A-G-E-115
DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 113 
This was further supported by the experiments in 
writing. A study of the tables shows that in general 
there is less nervous and muscular tension in black- 
board writing than in ordinary writing on paper. These 
two methods, however, involve so many differences 
that the physiological results are scarcely comparable. 
More significance may be attached to the results from 
the three different modes of writing upon paper. The 
third method in which the action involved the free 
arm shows the lowest degree of tension, while in the 
first mode involving mainly finger action, the tension 
is highest. Moreover, the blackboard writing was gen- 
erally smoother and more regular than that on paper, 
even than that written on paper with the whole arm 
movement, because the blackboard writing was done 
with more ample movement. In the free arm writ- 
ing on paper there was an obvious effort to keep the 
size of the letters down nearly to the usual size of pen 
or pencil writing and this necessitated a restrained, 
partially inhibited movement of the arm. The easiest 
movements were the freest arm movements, the most 
difficult were the most restricted finger movements. 
This must be understood to apply to the progress of 
the development of control. When, at the proper time 
control of the fingers has been attained for appropriate 
activities the work involved ‘may doubtless be done 
by the fingers with less effort than if the whole arm
-P-A-G-E-116
  114 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
were brought into play. It must be a waste to exer- 
cise large areas when small areas can easily perform 
the function. The teacher of writing who insists upon 
exclusive arm movement is as unreasonable as those 
who allow exclusive finger movement. 
VI. Value of Broad-pointed Instrument.—Directly 
connected with the above is another point. It 
was found that writing with a broad, smooth 
pen was, for most of the subjects, easier than writing 
with a fine pointed pen, and similarly, that writing 
with a broad, soft pencil was easier than with a hard, 
finely pointed pencil. With the finer instrument the 
children seemed instinctively to feel that more care 
must be exercised, that finer adjustments were neces- 
sary. 
VII. How Tension is Relaxed.—Incidentally it 
was shown that jn writing exercises there was a 
release of tension whenever the instrument left 
the writing surface, that is to say, when the pen, 
pencil, or crayon was momentarily raised in pass- 
ing from one word to the next or between letters— 
where the connecting line was omitted. This will account 
for the common tendency among young children learn- 
ing to write, among persons feeble with age, and 
among all of us when sensibly fatigued, to omit non- 
essential upstrokes and inconvenient joining lines be- 
tween letters in script. The skips between letters come
-P-A-G-E-117
  DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 115 
to form a sort of rhythmical relaxation of tension and 
thus greatly reduce the fatigue of continuous activity. 
VIII. Interest—The thoughtful reader will wonder 
why interest has not been given prominence among the 
factors in the development of motor control. There are 
three reasons for this. First, interest is really included 
in attention. It is the emotional element in attention. 
We give attention to a matter because we are interested, 
we wish to attain some desired end. As the attentive 
process continues new ends and aims, new elements of 
interest may arise to hold attention upon the problem. 
We attend to a matter only while we are interested. 
Second, in the eXperiments upon which these inferences 
are based there was little direct interest. The sawing 
and writing were done, not to produce something of 
direct value to the subject, but because I wished it done. 
It was observed, however, that in thpse cases, where the 
subject was, for personal or professional reasons, most 
  interested in the outcome, success was distinctly most 
marked. Third, next to the beginning of a discussion, 
the place of emphasis is at the close. Without detracting 
from the emphasis upon attention as the first and great- 
est factor in developing motor control, I wish here to 
impress the importance of interest. Where possible, 
direct interests should be utilized, otherwise recourse 
should be had to indirect interest, relying upon the devel- 
opment of direct interest through attention.

General Summary.—Whatever general significance 
there may be in this brief study of these various sub- 
jects actually engaged in manual occupations, under 
conditions as nearly normal as experimental exercises 
can be made, may be stated in a few words. It has al- 
ways been claimed for manual training that one of its 
chief benefits is along this line of developing motor con- 
trol. That seemed a quite obvious result. The study 
confirms this view. The simplest manual occupations, 
exercised with a fair degree of regularity and fre- 
quency, under the influence of interest and attention 
tends to develop, more or less rapidly, voluntary motor 
control for the particular movements involved. The 
race has evolved its powers through contact with its 
environment. In the later stages of the evolution that 
contact has been very largely a manual one. But all 
voluntary motor activities involve attention. Nothing 
worth while can be accomplished without attention. 
Moreover, as Professor Baldwin has somewhere said, 
if attention is not itself a motor phenomenon, it stimu- 
lates and correlates motor aspects of all to which we 
attend. In other words, manual occupations represent 
the working of the philogenetic law by which the 
psycho-physical powers have been evolved, and hence 
by which it is reasonable to expect the process to con- 
tinue to go on.

PuysicaAL AND PHysIOLOGICAL RESULTS. 
Education of the Nervous System,—In every stage 
of this enquiry the student should bear in mind how 
very slowly new general conceptions of important 
phases of the life of human society develop in the 
minds of the people. For generations there have been 
those who, in discussing education, have emphasized 
the necessity of due attention to the physical nature of 
the child, combating the more prevalent notion that it 
is the function of the school to give only mental train- 
ing, or at most, mental and moral training. The time 
honored platitude, “it is the mind that makes the man,” 
has been at least misleading, because only a half truth. 
Studies in physiological psychology are throwing light 
on this important subject. It has been made clear that 
in a very large measure the brain, indeed the entire 
nervous system, is at once the creature and the serv- 
ant of the organism as a whole. Nervous tissue is only 
a specialized form of protoplasm evolved by the or- 
ganism to perform special functions in its organic 
economy. Ina very large and important sense educa- 
tion has come to mean the development of the nervous _ 
system, but on the physical side it has come to mean 
117 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
    118 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
more than that. The recognized intimate relations 
among the sensory, the central, and the motor systems, 
and their mutual interdependence, make it obvious that 
education is primarily neuro-muscular development. 
Anatomy.—In order to understand how manual 
activities affect this development it is necessary first 
to review some features of the neuro-muscular equip- 
ment and to consider the possibilities of growth and 
development during childhood and youth. Considered 
anatomically the nervous system is composed of an 
aggregation of nerve elements embedded in a matrix 
of structures which support and nourish them. 
Chief Divisions.—There are two grand divisions: 
the central system, including the brain, spinal cord and 
spinal ganglia; and the peripheral system, embracing 
all the trunks and branches which connect the central 
system with the rest of the body. This peripheral sys- 
tem is more properly two systems, an afferent or sens- 
ory system composed of special sense organs and the 
fibers which connect these with the central system, 
and an efferent or motor system connecting the central 
system with the muscles in every part of the body. 
Formerly the terms employed to designate the nerve 
elements were “nerve cell’? and “nerve fiber,” and tt 
seemed to be implied, and was generally understood, 
that these two kinds of elements were in a way distinct
-P-A-G-E-121
  PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESULTS 19 
in both origin and function; that the cells were sort of 
organic batteries and the fibers were wires connecting 
them. According to later investigations the fibers are 
merely outgrowths from the cell body, and this cell 
body together with all its fibrous growths constitutes 
the nerve cell. That there are estimated to be about 
11,000 millions of these cells in the human system indi- 
cates what an army of trained, harmoniously co-operating 
workers the educated person may have. 
Dendrons and Neurons.—Of the cell outgrowths 
there are two kinds, dendrons and neurons. The den- 
drons are so called because they branch out into the 
surrounding tissue in a tree-like manner, while the 
neurons have a uniform caliber and the branches arise 
at right angles, usually only at the distal end. A cell 
may have several dendrons, but usually only one, 
sometimes two, and very rarely more than two, neu- 
rons. 
Both the dendrons and the neurons are pathways 
for nervous impulses, it being generally assumed that 
the dendrons convey impulses to the cell body and the 
neurons carry them away from it. It is not certain, 
however, that a given branch may not contain two 
pathways, one afferent and the other efferent. 
Nerve Development.—According to Professor Don- 
aldson, a study of a section of the developing spinal 
cord shows germinal cells dividing and producing
-P-A-G-E-122
    120 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
young nerve cells, called neuro-blasts, having a large | 
nucleus and a mass of cytoplasm at one pole, while this 
cytoplasm is being gradually drawn into a slender 
thread, the beginning of a neuron. As the neuro-blast 
grows there are marked changes in the developing cell; 
first, a great increase in the amount of cytoplasm, and 
second, an enlargement and elongation of the neuron.

largements of the cord, and in the peripheral system 
they reach from their point of origin in the cord to 
the most distant portions of the extremities. In each 
instance the fiber is a continuous growth of the cell

in volume to 500 times the cell body, and sometimes 
are even less than the cell body. Further, it seems that 
generally small cell bodies have neurons of small dia- 
meter and large cell bodies have neurons of large dia- 
meter. 
It is believed that the generation of new nerve 
cells ceases with the third month of foetal life, but 
after this time the total volume of the whole nervous 
system increases about 47 times. Since it is known 
that some parts of the system increases 10,000 times 
the original volume, it is evident that some parts in- 
crease little or not at all. Donaldson says: “The 
constructive development of nerve elements consists in 
an increase in size, in the formation of abundant 
cytoplasm and outgrowths, and in chemical modifica- 
tions which affect differently the several subdivisions 
of the cell.” + 
The studies of Kaiser upon this point are interest- 
ing. He examined and estimated the number of de- 
veloped nerve cells in similar portions of the spinal 
cord of man at different ages and tabulated the result

Development During Childhood.—It must be re- 
membered that this does not refer to the number of 
cells, but only to those that are developed so as to 
function as part of the system. It will thus be seen 
that the growth of the system goes on very rapidly 
between birth and the sixteenth year, but that it does 
not necessarily cease then. On the contrary it is be- 
lieved that development may be kept going, at least in 
the cortex, up to the thirtieth, fortieth, or even fiftieth 
year. 
Further evidence of this growth is found in the fact 
that, the average weight of the brain of a male child 
lat birth is 372 grammes; that of an adult male is 1,360 
lgrammes, an increase of 265 per cent. 
How the Nervous System Grows.—This possible in- 
rease in the total weight of the nervous system in- 
volves three factors: 
1. Increase in the mass of some of the previously 
indeveloped cell bodies. 
2. Increase in the number and size of cell out- 
rowths. 
3. Acquisition by the outgrowths of a medullary 
sheath, a process technically known as myelinization. 
his last named factor is probably the chief source of 
ncrease in weight, and its educational significance will 
ppear later. 
Recapitulation.—Restated, the condition of the
-P-A-G-E-126
  124 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
nervous system at birth is probably this: Every nerve 
cell which will be found in the adult is already present 
and all the main fibers and trunk outgrowths are 
formed, but a large number of cell bodies are unde- 
veloped and the fibers are not generally insulated from 
surrounding tissues, are not organized into systems of 
associated, co-operating groups. An impulse received 
in one part of the system spills as it goes along, over- 
flows the whole system. There is always an excess dis- 
charge of nervous energy and a corresponding general 
excess response of muscular activity. In the very young! 
child this condition is doubtless most favorable to the 
healthful development of the whole organism. A slight 
local stimulus gives rise to some general activity over 
large areas of the neuro-muscular system. Hence, ex- 
ercise, circulation, nutrition, and such conditions o 
growth and development are general and not localized| 
or special. When, however, controlled and specialized 
activity becomes desirable, this spilling of the impuls 
throughout the system would be most wasteful anc 
render efficiency impossible. 
A Two-fold Problem.—Now, if we are to be guide 
by the pedagogic doctrine of recent physiologica 
psychology that education is the development of th 
nervous system, that there is a psycho-physical par 
allelism in all activity, that is, for every change i 
mental stata there is a corresponding change in phys
-P-A-G-E-127
  PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESULTS 125 
ical state, two questions arise: First, the general ques- 
tion,—What are the conditions favorable to the growth 
and development of the nervous system after birth? 
Second, the more specific one—How do manual ac- 
       
                         
       
    tivities affect these conditions? 
To treat the former in detail would require a volume 
by itself, but the general answer is plain and simple. 
The first condition is that the nervous system shall be 
properly nourished ; that there shall be in the nourish- 
ing structures about the whole system a free circulation 
of blood supplying abundantly the proper nutritive ele- 
ments and carrying away waste. The second condition 
is that there shall be exercise of the nerves appropriate 
in kind and amount. The nervous system is an ex- 
tremely delicate organization which must function in 
lorder to grow, but unsuitable stimuli, or too much or 
too little exercise, may be equally harmful. 
To the second question the answer is not so ob- 
vious though, in general, it will readily appear that 
ny form of appropriate physical activity promotes 
irculation, digestion, and assimilation, and hence, 
ends to keep the whole organism in a healthful con- 
lition. It will also be conceded that the physical ac- 
ivity is even more important to the growing child 
han to the mature adult. But this is a very super- 
cial view; we must look deeper.
-P-A-G-E-128
126 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Probable Limits of Growth—While it is not 
claimed that any process of education can produce 
essentially fundamental changes in the nervous or- 
ganization, it is believed that certain kinds of ex- 
perience, certain modes of training can stimulate into 
functioning activity some of the dormant, undeveloped 
cells, and to some extent can, through suitable exer- 
cise, strengthen the already formed structures. In a 
child whose developed nerve cells are relatively few and 
            
   
    
     
     
    
   
   ill-nourished such training will have little result, but it will 
be correspondingly effective in growth and develop- 
ment, where the nervous organization is vigorous and| 
predisposed to activity. Racial inheritance or family char- 
acteristics may largely determine the possibilities of con 
tinued growth. In the case of individuals or races 
where life experiences early become a settled routin 
a limited number of associated activities becom 
habitual. The simple conditions of life do not de 
mand many new experiences and there is little in 
herent impulse to seek them; hence, certain habitua 
reactions become early established and later growt! 
is improbable, if not impossible. 
Donaldson says: “It is to be anticipated that on 
great difference in races will be found to lie in th 
extent of growth and organization in the nervous sys 
tem after birth, and especially after puberty. Shoul 
it turn out on further examination that some of th
-P-A-G-E-129
  PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESULTS 127 
lower races lose their capacity for training after 
adolescence, we should look with interest for changes 
in the central cortex in order to determine whether 
growth there practically ceases at puberty. * 
It is now well established that among some of the 
lower races, and in some individual cases in other 
races, the capability of intellectual education practic- 
ally ceases at about the age of puberty, and there are 
evidences that in all such cases the one hope of fur- 
ther education lies along the line of direct appeal to 
the sensori-motor portions of the nervous system; 
that is, practically, in large measure, to manual ac- 
tivities. 
Conclusion.—Without trying to cover the whole 
field of this topic the following general conclusions 
may be indicated: 
1. The nerve cell is itself a source of energy. In 
early life at least, both the cell body and the out- 
growths are plastic and capable of growth and de- 
velopment. An important factor in promoting this 
growth is the necessity of adjustment to new condi- 
tions, the establishment of ready means of communica- 
tion and co-operation among different cells and groups 
of cells. In a certain sense the whole cortex is motor; 
when stimulated at any point there is a response in 
some form of muscular activity. Every effort of the

  128 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
organism to perform a new act tends to develop prev- 
iously undeveloped cells into activity and to estab- 
lish new lines of association and co-operation. By 
repetition of these experiences new outgrowths are 
produced and some of these already present are en- 
             
     
   
    
   
      
      
   larged through exercise and the development of the 
sheath. For a time every repetition of a new ac- 
tivity continues to promote this growth. When one 
estimates the almost infinite number of sensory, dis. 
criminations and muscular activites that are involved 
in a simple act of manual manipulation such as model 
ing a rabbit in clay, taking a running stitch, or mak 
ing a mortise and tenon, and how all the cooperat: 
ing nerves and muscles must act in perfect harmon 
in time and in degree of energy, he can get some no 
tion of the effect of such activities upon the growt 
and education of the neuro-muscular system. Accept: 
ing the view that the race has in all the earlier stage: 
developed largely through its efforts in manual ma 
nipulations it is evident that this is “the good ol 
method of education,” and that, within certain limita 
tions, the more varied and the more complex the ac 
tivities essayed the greater the number of neuro 
muscular elements developed and the larger the nu: 
ber of co-operating areas established. 
Reference has already been made to the strengt 
of the impulse to motor activity and to the interest i

  PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESULTS 129 
various forms of manual arts, as well as to the physi- 
ological effect of the emotional attitude of the worker 
during the performance of any activity. It is reason- 
able to infer, therefore, that when a child is engaged 
in manual occupations that he enjoys, the emotional 
factor of the activity, as well as the natural intensity 
with which it is performed, are most favorable to a 
healthful development of the system. 
*2. It has been pointed out that the manual arts 
furnish some of the best means of developing the 
powers of sense discrimination. Not only, therefore, 
does this normal method of sense training assist ma- 
terially in the general devlopment of the nervous sys- 
tem, but a well developed sensory system makes the 
individual alert and receptive, just as a well developed 
efferent system gives promptness and_ effectiveness 
in execution, and a central system well developed and 
organized in connection with the other two gives 
poise, control, and practical judgment.

  CHAPTER VIII. 
INTELLECTUAL VALUES 
In the preceding chapter it was shown that motor ac- 
tivity is essential to the differentiation and development 
of the nervous system. Our topic requires that we go 
somewhat more into detail and show that it is largely 
through some kind of physical movement that the young 
child gets its first real knowledge, first becomes aware of 
himself and of things other than self. That which is so 
important in the beginning continues to be of great sig- 
nificance throughout life, and especially during the dis- 
tinctly developmental stages of childhood and youth. 
Three Kinds of Motor Activity Various motor ac- 
tivities may be grouped in three classes ; first, pure reflex 
activities such as breathing, winking, sucking, and grasp- 
ing ; second, random movements, due to accumulated ner- 
vous energy which seeks its own discharge, but have no 
other stimulus and no aim or purpose, such as the rest- 
less arm and leg movements of a little child; third, volun- 
tary movements made in response to some special stimu- 
lus and directed toward some end. Examples of this 
are too numerous and obvious to need mention. 
Development of Voluntary Movement.—It is with 
this third kind of motor activities we have chiefly to do, 
but it should be understood that movements of this kind 
130
-P-A-G-E-133
  4 * INTELLECTUAL VALUES 131 
have their origin in the other two kinds. It will be easy 
to see that random movements give results in sensation 
that lead the organism to perform some other movement 
involving more or less of consciousness, aim, and will. 
If the result of the random movement is an agreeable 
sensation, there will be an effort to repeat that move- 
ment again and again in order to reproduce the sensa- 
tion. Similarly, if the random movement results in an un- 
pleasant sensation there will be a movement to avoid 
that sensation. These first efforts to control movements 
are likely to be very clumsy, and to involve a large ex- 
cess nervous discharge spreading over the whole 
nervous and muscular systems. But, through some 
line of this discharge of nervous impulse success is at- 
tained. In each subsequent success there is a little less 
waste of effort. In this way certain cell bodies and out- 
growths become the special pathway for the stimulus 
that produces that particular movement. In time the out- 
growths become enclosed in a sheath, an insulation, and 
the nervous energy, with the consequent muscular 
energy, is still further economized. Thus is set 
up a system of specialization in. function among nerve 
elements. This differentiation and specialization of func- 
tion is the beginning of consciousness and hence the be- 
ginning of intellectual power. Throughout life mental 
development depends upon this kind of growth and or- 
ganization.

Sense-Training——The importance of training the 
senses has already been sufficiently elaborated in Chapter 
IV, and the relation of training in manual arts and indus- 
tries to sense-training has been shown. It is, therefore, 
scarcely necessary to suggest a recalling of how, in deal- 
ing with materials in the kitchen, the sewing room, the 
shop, the art room, and the garden, these sense powers 
are constantly being trained under most favorable con- 
ditions. 
Manual Activities and Right Attitudes.—In the 
chapters on Development of Motor Control it was pointed 
out that a fundamental factor in such development is 
the emotional attitude toward the activities involved. 
When we consider this in connection with another fact, 
that children almost invariably enjoy handling material 
things, planning and designing, constructing and produc- 
ing something of value, in other words, enjoy the activi- 
ties themselves and the sense of power that comes through 
work in manual and domestic arts, we see how favorable 
these experiences are to the development of the intel- 
lectual powers involved. 
Training Attention—Psychologists and other teach- 
ers are agreed that the most important work in intellectual 
education is the development of the power of prolonged, 
concentrated attention. The ability to apprehend facts, 
to comprehend all the conditions that pertain to a par- 
ticular situation, to compare and see relations, hence
-P-A-G-E-135
  INTELLECTUAL VALUES 133 
to exercise good judgment, all depends upon this power 
of attention. We know also, that attention is conditioned 
by interest, in other words, by the motive. We attend 
to that in which we are interested, that which we have 
some motive for considering. All our voluntary activi- 
ties are directed toward some end, the attainment of 
something we consider of value. It is a pathetic truism 
that a considerable percentage of our children become 
indifferent, idle, troublesome, and eventually leave school 
because so much of the work provided does not appeal 
to them as of value. They have no genuine motive for 
doing it. In Chapter III it was shown that children have 
many interests in the various forms of manual activities. 
This psychologic theory has been confirmed by experience. 
Among the most obvious results of the introduction of 
manual arts and domestic science into the schools is the 
fact that many more pupils continue in a school a 
much longer time than before these lines of work were 
introduced. 
This should require no argument. Many children 
have no direct interest in much of the work assigned in 
school. The skillful teacher finds a way of supply- 
ing an indirect interest, and if this works well a direct 
interest may develop. But practically all children have 
a direct interest in well-planned work in manual arts 
and industries. When a boy elects to make himself a sled, 
or a girl an apron, there is a genuine motive for every
-P-A-G-E-136
  134 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES | 
step in the process. The end is seen more or less clearly 
from the beginning. Each step is planned and executed 
with reference to the whole. Nothing can be done right 
without due attention. If mistakes are made they must 
be corrected. The more complex the project, and the 
more the worker is left to his own initiative and self- 
direction, the more attention he must give to it, hence, 
the more training he gets. It follows, then, that under 
right methods of training (see Chapter XVI) work in the 
shop, the kitchen, the garden, etc., provides most favorable 
conditions for developing the power and the habit of at- 
tention. 
Constructive Imagination.—Among the powers exer- 
cised in giving attention to work in manual arts and indus- 
tries is constructive imagination. Where the teacher is wise 
enough to let the pupils make their own plans, at least 
tentatively, the project must first be built up in imagina~ 
tion. There must be images of the whole, of the parts 
individually, and of these assembled in the whole. This 
is just as true of dressing a doll as of making a table. 
The girl who cannot use this power in dressing a doll 
appropriately, certainly should not be expected to select 
suitable clothing for herself. Moreover, unless she has 
had considerable experience in thus planning or design- 
ing things, she could not be qualified to select furniture or 
wall-paper for a room, to hang pictures, or even set a table 
so that it would look well. To the boy in most walks in
-P-A-G-E-137
  INTELLECTUAL VALUES 135 
life this training is equally important. Whenever he 
has to do with the construction of anything, or to judge 
of the value of anything constructed, this constructive 
imagery comes into play. Moreover, this power is es- 
sential in understanding descriptive literature, in all prob- 
lems in mensuration, and in all forms of invention, or of 
artistic industrial designing. 
Practical Judgment.—Another very important intel- 
lectual power is judgment, and it is easy to see how practi- 
cal judgment is continually being exercised in work in in- 
dustrial arts. First, there are the questions, What do I 
want to do most? What is most worth doing? How long 
will it take? Then there is the determination of plans. 
general and particular; the deciding upon materials; the 
order of steps in the process. As the work proceeds 
there is an exercise of judgment at each and every stage 
as to whether results are satisfactory. When a boy has 
finished a project he rarely needs to be told whether his 
work is good, bad, or indifferent. A girl who has had 
intelligent experience in sewing is likely to be a much 
better judge of fabrics than one who has had none, and 
one who has had good training in cooking not only knows 
how foods should be cooked, when they are well cooked, 
but what foods are wholesome, nutritious, and economical. 
When she reads a new recipe her judgment tells her 
whether it is worth trying or not. In dealing with ma-
-P-A-G-E-138
  136 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
terial things it is especially true that one learns quite as 
much by his errors in judgment as by his successes. 
Reasoning.—Professor Angell has given us a broad 
definition of reasoning as “purposive thinking, that is to 
say, thinking carried on in the interests of some plan 
which we wish to execute, some problem which we wish 
to solve, some difficulty which we wish to sur- 
mount.” Now, it is in manual arts and industries 
precisely these conditions that make them intellectually 
educative. There must be a more or less clearly defined 
end in view in each piece of work undertaken. The proc- 
ess must involve thinking out a plan, and in the execu- 
tion there will be difficulties to surmount. The “unedu- 
cated” cook cannot understand why “there are days when 
the bread won’t raise ;” the unskilled dairy maid is help- 
less before the fact that one day it takes only fifteen 
minutes’ churning to produce good buttter, while another 
day she works an hour and gets an inferior product. The 
person who has been put into the right attitude toward 
such things knows there is no chance about them; they 
are governed by simple physical laws. When things do 
not go right it is the business of the worker to search out 
the cause, to find a way to remove it, and so set the 
process going as it should. Thus we find that in these 
so-called manual occupations we have training, under 
favorable conditions, in every kind of intellectual activity, 
perception,. memory, imagination, conception, judgment,
-P-A-G-E-139
  INTELLECTUAL VALUES 137 
reason. In fact, where there is reasoning there must be 
all the other processes, because reasoning, the most com- 
plete process, involves all the others. 
Motor Training for Defectives.—The now generally 
accepted theory in regard to the education of feeble- 
minded children, and indeed the prevailing practice in 
the best schools for such children, are strong confirmation 
of our contention that systematic training in motor ac- 
tivities is an important means of developing intellectual 
activities, especially in the early stages. Sequin? is prob- 
ably the best authority on this subject. 
In his careful investigations and extensive experience 
he found that feeble-minded children, under training in 
the usual school studies, made very little progress in in- 
tellectual development. On the other hand, when he be- 
gan with training in motor activities, there was usually 
a very perceptible awakening of mental powers, and in 
proportion as they gained in motor control they gained 
in mental alertness and in power of sustained attention. 
For the testimony of an expert neurologist on this 
point one should read Donaldson, “Growth of the Brain,” 
especially Chapter XVIII. The gist of his view is that 
formal education should aim first at the development of 
the motor areas, because they naturally function first, 
  
1 Sequin. “Idiocy and its Treatment by the Physiological 
Method.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
ee 
138 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
and the development of the higher centers depends upon 
that of the lower. 
Cautions.—Again a word of caution seems necessary. 
There is nothing in this discussion to imply that hand- 
work may not be done with little or no attention or 
thought. Some forms of occupation soon become so 
nearly automatic as to require but little attention, but 
these should not be the things that occupy much time or 
attention in a school course. Then too, the “uneducated” 
teacher of manual training or domestic science may im- 
poverish the course by prescribing “cut and dried” direc- 
tions, and removing much of the necessity for thinking. 
Furthermore, this may be the best place to say, that, 
while well directed work in such academic studies as lit- 
erature, science, and mathematics, gives excellent intel- 
lectual training, such work may be done in a way that 
requires very little mental effort, and mere reading may 
become a favorite resort of the intellectually lazy.
-P-A-G-E-141
  CHAPTER IX. 
AESTHETIC VALUES. 
Meaning of Aesthetic Activity.—Grosse has given 
us a good working conception of artistic activity : 
“By an aesthetic or artistic activity we mean one 
which in its course, or in its direct result, possesses 
_ an immediate emotional factor—in art it is usually 
a pleasurable one. Aesthetic activity is, therefore, 
not entered upon as a means toward an end outside 
itself, but is in itself the end. In this respect it 
presents itself to us as the exact opposite of practical 
activity which always serves as a means.” * 
Further Description—Three other ideas are essen- 
tial to a right understanding of this activity. First, it 
is rarely an isolated activity, but very commonly combines 
with practical activities of one kind or another. This is 
very important in this connection because in the main 
we are dealing with distinctly utilitarian occupations. 
Second, the pleasure which characterizes an artistic ac- 
tivity may be realized throughout the whole course of the 
process, or in its result, or in both. Third, the enjoy- 
ment is not limited to those who perform the activities ° 
or produce the results, but is shared by those who through 
any sense are able to partake of its pleasure-giving power. 
‘Ernst Grosse. “The Beginnings of Art,” page 48. 
139  
-P-A-G-E-142
140 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
This condition is essential to the fullest realization of 
the effect by the artist himself. His work must have 
some measure of public approval. The following is a 
clear statement of this view: 
“In order to define art exactly, we must first of 
all cease to look upon it as a means of gratification, 
and consider art as one of the conditions of human 
life. Considering art in this way, we cannot but 
see that art is.one of the means of communication 
of people with one another. 
“Every production of art brings it to pass that 
the recipient enters into a certain kind of relation 
with the person who produces or produced that ob- 
ject of art and all of those who, at the same time 
with him, before, or after him, receive or will re- 
ceive the same artistic impression. 
“As speech, which conveys peoples’ thoughts and 
experiences, serves as a means of uniting peoples, 
so art acts in exactly the same way. The character- 
istic of this kind of communication, distinguishing 
it from communication by means of words, consists| 
in this, that by words oné person conveys to another| 
his thoughts, while by art people convey to one an- 
other their feelings.” + 
Early Evidences of Art Impulse.—The earliest mani- 
festations of the aesthetic impulse take the form of play, 
Tolstoi. “What is Art,” page 70. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
  AESTHETIC VALUES 141 
The child plays with its vocal organs, mere cooings and 
babblings to be sure, but taking somewhat a rhythmical 
movement, and gradually growing into a crude sort of 
song. Then follow various forms of personification, 
dramatization, and personal decoration, all involving, be- 
side art, a large measure of the impulse to imitate. 
It has been suggested in Chapter III how these im- 
pulses to play and to imitate are but the’ natural pre- 
cursors of the impulse to construct, and how this, in turn, 
gives the occasion for the normal expression of the 
impulse to produce artistic design in plan and the attempt 
to decorate the constructed article. 
Origin of Art—A study of the art of primitive peo- 
ples shows us that one form of art invariably begins with 
an attempt to decorate an article that has been tonstructed 
for some practical purpose. This seems to be a natural 
sequence. When one gets control of a practical activity 
the aesthetic impulse seeks its opportunity, its medium, 
for expression as an accompaniment of the practical. The 
utilitarian product expresses the purpose of the worker ; 
the decorative element expresses the emotional attitude. 
This feeling may be pride in the result of the labor, or in 
ownership of the product, of a sense of joy in contempla- 
tion of what seems beautiful in decoration itself. 
Examples of Art Evolution.—The primitive modes 
of cooking were purely utlitarian, to make the foods more 
nutritious and more digestible than in the raw state. Now 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  142 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
the cook or housewife, who takes any sort of pride in 
her cooking,+studies numberless ways of making her 
dishes attractive to the eye as well as to the palate. Even 
plain ham and eggs are served on a dish garnished with 
a spray of parsley. Table porcelain presents an exceed- 
ingly interesting aesthetic evolution, of which, however, 
the vast majority of people know little or nothing. 
The first pottery was made solely to be used as con- 
taining vessels. The material used, the general form and 
the character of the surface, offered such opportunity 
for the expression cf aesthetic feeling that for a long time 
nearly all pottery has been more or less decorated. A 
later stage of the evolution of this industry has given us 
immense quantities of pottery from which the utilitarian 
motive has disappeared entirely. It is produced solely for 
its aesthetic value, and takes its place among the fine arts. 
Examples of Application.—The young child of to-day 
has many marked advantages over the adult of primitive 
times in possible ideals of construction and decoration. 
His environment is full of suggestion for him, so that, 
as compared with race progress, he can make short cuts 
to results in both. 
A Rug.—A little girl who designs the pattern 
and selects the colors for a rug for her doll’s 
house has essentially the problem of the primitive 
weaver, but may have also much aid from the products 
of modern textile art. At the same time the number of
-P-A-G-E-145
  AESTHETIC VALUES 143 
colors and the complexity of design in the rugs the 
child observes may be a hindrance, unless there is wise 
guidance on the part of the teacher. An early form of 
floor covering was simply woven rushes. If the child 
merely wishes to cover the floor, a piece of coarse can- 
vas, or a rug of plain gray wool would suffice; but, just 
to the extent that she tries to secure pleasing effects by 
choice of colors and by arrangement of these in design, 
she expresses her aesthetic impulse and develops her 
taste. 
A Waist—When the older girl in the sewing class 
comes to choose the material, decides upon the pat- 
tern, and selects the trimming for a waist, she becomes 
an amateur Worth. There will be an exercise of practical 
judgment and of aesthetic taste in deciding upon the 
appropriateness of the material for the purpose for which 
the waist is intended. In deciding upon the color there 
will still be an exercise of practical judgment as to what 
is appropriate for the occasions when this waist will be 
worn, but artistic feeling will predominate when relating 
the color of the waist to that of the other clothing to 
be worn with it, to that of her own complexion, eyes, 
land hair. 
A Piece of Furniture—Similarly, when a boy in the 
shop plans to make a chair, a table, or a book-case, he 
should be encouraged to determine for himself upon the 
size of the whole, then upon the relative proportions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
144 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
the whole, and of the various parts; first, with a view to 
its utility, and second, to its appearance. The selection | 
of the material may be largely an intellectual problem, 
but even this will have its aesthetic factor. Pine is ad- 
mirable for some purposes, but no kind of stain or finish 
can make it appropriate in fine furniture. Then, if the 
young worker can be led to see that good proportions, 
plain, simple lines of construction well worked out, give 
a vastly more pleasing effect than an attempt at elaborate 
ornament out of harmony with the purpose of the article, 
or indifferently executed, he has made a good beginning 
toward the development of an artistic conception of con- 
structive work. 
A Question of Methods.—The extent to which the 
children shall be left to themselves in these matters is 
a problem for the teacher. It should never be forgotten 
that the dominant purpose, nay rather the whole pur- 
pose, is the development of the child and that development 
can come only through his reconstruction of his own ex- 
perience. Where the teacher provides completed models 
to be reproduced, or makes plans to be followed in detail 
by the pupils, or where the pupils work from dictation, 
whether dealt out in the aggregate or in petty install- 
ments, the child gets only a modicum of experience and 
that in a very unacceptable, unsatisfactory form. On 
the other hand, when pupils are allowed a large measure 
of initiation and self-direction in these matters they make 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  AESTHETIC VALUES 145 
mistakes, grievous mistakes, but they get the full benefit 
of the experience; they derive the result, learn to know 
the joy, of independent effort; they develop an abiding 
interest in the problems involved in the experience. When 
they realize these problems they are prepared for genuine 
study of the subject, whether by referring to books, by 
examining good examples of the thing they wish to make, 
or by discussion with teacher and classmates. 
Personal Motives.—Drawing comes to have a new 
meaning and value to boys and girls when they wish to 
represent definitely their plans for the construction and 
decoration of some article. Some of the best drawing 
and composition the writer has ever seen produced by 
young children was in nature study reports in connec- 
tion with the work in a school garden. Again, the study 
of color is vital when it becomes a question of a suitable 
waist for a slight blonde or for a stout brunette; or 
when it is a question of how to finish a bird-house or a 
parlor tabouret. 
Taste in Color—The natural inclination of most 
children is toward brightness in colors, and elaborateness 
in decoration. The genuine artistic problems in con- 
nection with work in manual arts present the most favora- 
ble opportunities for indicating where bright colors are 
appropriate, and where quiet colors and simplicity of de- 
sign and of decoration in general are more effective. 
The General Aim.—Let us not be misunderstood. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  146 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
We do not teach literature with the idea that even one 
pupil in a hundred will become a producer of literature ; 
rather that each may, in proportion to his capacity, de- 
velop a taste for the best in literature, may share in what 
the masters have provided for all who qualify to receive 
and enjoy them. True, if the teacher of English recog- 
nizes in his classes a “lad o’ pairts” in a literary way, he 
should foster the rare talent as fully as possible, but the 
teacher’s great work is always with the ninety and nine. 
These will come most fully into an appreciation of the art 
of literature when, having studied some of the best inten- 
sively, they try to write something that, to them, in 
form as well as thought, seems worth while. 
In like manner, we do not teach music in the public 
schools with the idea that we shall develop a Handel, a 
Mendelssohn or a Patti. Nor do we teach drawing and 
painting hoping to produce a Raphael, a Rembrandt or a 
Rubens. If the embryo masters are in our midsty these 
public school courses should help to discover them, but 
the real work on the aesthetic side, in relation to the 
great productions of art, is designed to develop apprecia- 
tion, that the mass of our people educated in the common 
schools may acquire a discriminating taste in these 
things, that they learn to enjoy what is most inspiring 
and elevating. 
Scope of Application—This principle is very far- 
reaching. Under the direction of judicious, well-trained
-P-A-G-E-149
  
AESTHETIC VALUES 147 
teachers, pupils may develop ideas of harmony and good 
effect in colors through the use of colors in adding beauty 
to something they value because of its usefulness. When 
they want a design for something they are making, they 
are ready to study design with a motive, that is, with 
genuine interest. Then the idea of design becomes in- 
corporated into the life experiences, and is not a thing 
apart. 
Children who have had a course in pottery, under 
good instruction, will never be satisfied with porcelain 
smeared with natural flowers, or with the crude color 
bespattered stuff that has been thrust upon the American 
market as Japanese art. 
Boys and girls who have been rightly directed in the 
making of designs for wall and floor coverings, will have 
no use for those patterns that throw everything else in 
the room into the background. Present conditions in this 
respect are well expressed by a statement recently made 
by a designer for a large New York wall paper factory: 
“Nine out of ten of the designs I make are bad. Manu- 
facturers have to make what the people will buy, and 
very few people in America know a good design when 
they see it, or will buy it when a responsible dealer assures 
them it is good. Indeed, few house decorators have had 
a training that enables them to know good designs.” 
Children who have been led to study house decoration 
under a competent teacher will not decorate (?) the  
-P-A-G-E-150
  148 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
front room by hanging a crude crayon reproduction of 
the photograph of some loved one in a massive shell frame 
of gilded gypsum or putty. 
__ The girl who has studied what is appropriate in dress 
will have simple house dresses in which to work, and 
will not be found doing the morning work or going to 
market in an old evening gown. ; 
One more illustration must suffice. Those who have 
done even a little work on furniture will have a life long 
interest in the contemplation of what is good and appro- 
priate, and will have only contempt for the machine 
pressed imitation of carving, cheap showy upholstering, 
or imitation woods. 
No doubt one reason why so many boys and girls 
leave the farm is that they do not learn to see and appre- 
ciate the beauties of nature all about them. Better farm- 
ing will develop this appreciation. No one can resist the 
attraction of well-bred stock. All the farm folk see the 
beauty of waving crops when they are good crops. From 
contemplation of these one comes unconsciously to see, 
admire, and love the green valley, the winding stream, 
the wooded hills. More renumerative farming will allow 
time and money for art, and art always leads back to 
nature.

CHAPTER X 
EruHicaL VALUES 
Specific Problem.—Attention has already been called 
in Chapter II to the fact that the introduction of manual 
arts and industries into elementary schools was first chiefly 
urged for ethical reasons. Moral and religious reformers 
took up the cause in the belief that idle habits and lack 
of_skill in common industries are prime causes of xice 
and crime; that on the other hand, persons trained into 
habits of industry, especially skillful industry, are not 
only likely to be preoccupied in wholesome ways, but 
are also.likely. to be self-reliant, self-respecting, and self- 
sustaining. In other words, these habits, these charac- 
teristics are fundamental conditions of an ethical life, 
and these reformers appreciate the great fact that in the 
matter of habits an ounce of formation is worth a ton of 
reformation. This view will be generally accepted, but 
it must be remembered that these advocates of manual 
arts in the schools had in mind, in most cases at least 
such training as would lead directly to some mechanical 
trade. Our idea is not primarily that at all, but rather 
to provide for experiences that are important factors in 
the early education of every child. In what special ways 
have these experiences an ethical value?

-P-A-G-E-152
  
  150 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Workmanship Impulse.—The disposition to work 
is not an original impulse or instinct. Primitive man 
had no daily routine of occupations such as characterize 
civilized life. His activities in the main, were directed 
toward supplying his immediate needs for food, shelter 
and other protection. Through countless generations in- 
dividuals of the race have been engaged in those activi- 
ties necessary to sustain life, satisfy desires, remove dis- 
comforts, and gradually to procure luxuries. Concurrently 
with these experiences the development of retentive 
memory and reason enabled man to see that his efforts 
may be economized by doing certain things at certain 
times, by anticipating certain needs and providing for 
them in advance. Gradually he learned to project him- 
self more and more into the future, so that the plans 
and activities of to-day may be prompted by an end to be 
realized months or even years hence. 
Children Live in the Present.—In young children this 
kind of workmanship impulse is little developed. They 
are, fortunately, unable to project themselves into the 
future, to anticipate needs; hence, they do not undertake 
projects with remote ends. If they build a hut or dig a 
cave, it is for the present, with little or no thought for 
next year. The real workmanship attitude, the attitude 
that impels the individual to undertake economic projects 
to provide for future needs, possibly the needs of others 
as well as the self, must be developed.
-P-A-G-E-153
  ETHICAL VALUES 151 
Doubtful Conditions.——In many children the usual 
school studies do this to some extent, but there are two 
important limitations. First, the activities of the pupil 
in his study of books are very different from his probable 
activities in after years. Indeed, some persons get the 
student habit so firmly fixed that they are unable to suc- 
ceed in other things. Commonly the working habit of 
the student of books is only partially transferable to 
manual work. Second, there are many children who do 
not “take to books.” To such children much of the 
school work does net seem worth while. Learning to 
spell words that they never expect to use, reading about 
things that they already know, or do not care to know, 
solving problems that are no problems of theirs, all these 
conditions tend to make them indifferent, train them to 
slight and shirk assigned work. 
Favorable Conditions.—On the other hand, nearly all 
children like manual activities, and this is likely to be 
especially true of those who are not attracted by books. 
These activities, when well planned, furnish the natural 
medium for the expression of the impulses to do, to 
construct, to imitate, to experiment. Moreover, to most 
children, under favorable conditions as to training, the 
work in manual arts and domestic science seems more 
worth while than much of the assigned work in books. 
There is concrete material with which to work and the 
end is a definite reality. Incomplete preparation of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  152 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
lesson may not be easily discovered. In the case of hand- 
work, if the child’s motive is not strong enough to carry 
the project to completion, the failure is obvious. It is 
usually easy for the teacher to insist upon its completion. 
The result speaks for itself. Every step of the process 
stands revealed in the product. It is a concrete example 
of “Virtue is its own reward.” 
But, the teacher should remember that, educationally, 
the finished product is not the thing of value. The vital 
product is in the child, in the satisfaction he derives from 
the various stages of the work, and especially from the 
completed product, in the sense of power he gains, in the 
self-reliance developed, in the attitude toward new under- 
takings. These conditions are essential to the develop- 
ment of an ethical character. 
A Sense of Responsibility—An important element 
in moral character is a sense of responsibility for time, 
opportunity, obligations assigned or assumed. In this 
country, at this time, the importance of this sense of 
responsibility can scarcely be overestimated, because 
American boys and girls, especially in urban life, are 
deplorably lacking in this respect. The cause, in part, 
is the change in industrial conditions that have removed 
the necessity for the children’s sharing in the responsibili- 
ties of the home life. So many things formerly produced 
in the home are now made in factories. In a city home
-P-A-G-E-155
  ETHICAL VALUES 153 
there is scarcely anything for a boy to do, and much 
less than formerly for girls. 
This, however, is not the only cause of the lack of a 
sense of responsibility among our young people. There 
has commonly been an absurd extension of the democratic 
idea of self-government in the home and in the school. 
Children openly boast, with evident reason, their inde- 
pendence of parental control. This attitude inevitably 
carries over into the school, where, sometimes, an over- 
soft pedagogy fosters it. Or, if the school insists upon 
obedience and prompt, efficient discharge of daily duty, 
the coddling parents interfere. In some American fami- 
lies this alleged democracy becomes in reality an absolute 
monarchy with the child on the throne. The result is 
usually written large, shame and sorrow for the parents, 
and life failure for the child. 
A Comparison.—What can manual arts and industries 
in the schools do toward counteracting these tendencies, 
more than may be done by the academic studies? Perhaps 
nothing more than may be done, because, if the academic 
studies are so planned that they appeal to the interests of 
the students, and if the requirements are exacting the 
student must learn to assume responsibility. There is, 
however, an important difference in the nature of the 
two kinds of work. In academic studies it is very diffi- 
cult, often practically impossible, to estimate accurately 
a pupil’s effort. A selection of literature may be studied 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
154 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
thoroughly or in the most superficial way, and the teacher 
may not discover the difference. Very young children 
learn the arts of shirking and simulating, and older 
students become experts in these arts. In work in the 
shops, the kitchen, the sewing room, or the school garden 
failure of any kind is easily detected. When a pupil un- 
dertakes to make a garment, a bookrack, a loaf of bread, 
he can readily be held responsible for every step in the 
process, for the time spent upon it, and for the character 
of the completed product. There is always a product that 
stands for the effort, for the attention to details, and to 
both teacher and pupil there is a certain standard to be 
attained, Even though the work sometimes becomes dis- 
tasteful, the sense of increasing skill, together with the 
final completion, brings a degree of satisfaction that is 
ample reward for the conscious effort required, and good 
preparation for subsequent undertakings. When a child 
acquires toward certain activities the attitude: This 
ought to be done, shall be done to the best of my ability, 
he has learned the lesson of responsibility. Through a 
regular series of undertakings this attitude becomes 
habitual toward all work that for any sufficient reasons 
seems worth doing. 
Sense of Efficiency.—With the accomplishment of 
each undertaking comes an increased sense of skill and 
efficiency. Society is burdened with inefficient men and 
women. They do not know the love of accomplishment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
ETHICAL VALUES 155 
the joy that comes from a sense of skill in any occupa- 
tion. Experience demonstrates that one of the very ob- 
vious results of work in the shop, in the sewing room, 
or in the cooking class, is the development of this sense of 
ability to do things well. Every piece of work proclaims 
in clearest tones the efficiency or inefficiency of. the 
worker. If good, it wins for the young worker social 
approval in the class, in his home, to some extent, in the 
community. All this tends to develop self-respect, self- 
reliance, a sense of power and skill that is basal in good 
character. 
Integrity.—This topic is taken up mainly because the 
claim is commonly made that training in manual occupa- 
tions has special value as a means of developing a sense 
of honor and integrity, while opponents of the general 
introduction of this work into the schools protest that 
shop or kitchen work has no more influence upon the 
sense of honor than work in general academic studies. 
Probably the latter are right. Otherwise we should ex- 
pect to find higher standards of integrity among skilled 
dressmakers and carpenters than among teachers and 
doctors. 
The real significance of this aspect of our problem 
lies in two considerations: First, the general one already 
referred to, namely, that the habit of industry in some 
legitimate occupation is a prime condition of general 
morality including integrity. The schools have heretofore 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  156 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
continually aimed to prepare boys and girls for profes- 
sional careers, or for unproductive lives of leisure, rather 
than for manual occupations. Elementary school work 
has centered about the three R’s. In earlier days when 
children received training in manual occupations in the 
home the conditions were fairly satisfactory, but condi- 
tions are greatly changed. A very large number of chil- 
dren now have but little in the way of manual occupation 
or responsibility, still less of systematic training, in the 
home. Out of school hours they play, read, practice 
music (all of which is good), but they do not learn to 
work with their hands. There can be no question that 
a training that gives a boy or girl a sense of ability to 
control material things, that leads to frequent experience 
of satisfaction through producing something worth while, 
is a great moral force. The new industrial and social con- 
ditions demand that this training be given in the schools. 
Second, the value of training in manual arts and 
domestic science as a means of developing integrity and 
a fine sense of honor depends very largely upon the 
character of that training. If copies of designs are passed 
off as originals, if putty, wood-stain, and varnish are used 
to hide poor materials or careless workmanship, if birch 
is made to pass for mahogany, or maple for quarter- 
sawed oak, if seams are loose and unfinished, in a word, 
if handwork is not genuine, if it is intended to de- 
ceive, the effect upon the worker is demoralizing. The
-P-A-G-E-159
ETHICAL VALUES 157 
opposite is obvious. If pupils are trained to use good 
materials, to measure and weigh accurately, to do work 
that will bear inspection inside and out; if the training 
leads them to see and appreciate the difference between 
sincerity and sham, it cannot fail to develop moral fibers 
of genuine integrity. This is the more certain because, 
while pretence in a recitation is elusive, in handwork the 
product stands with more or less permanence to com- 
mend or condemn, 
Will Training.—Regarding attention and volition 
Professor Angell says: ‘“‘No idea can dominate our move- 
ments which does not catch and hold our attention. 
Indeed, volition as a strictly mental affair is neither more 
nor less than a matter of attention. When we keep our 
attention firmly fixed upon a line of conduct, to the ex- 
clusion of all competitors, our decision is already made.” * 
This suggests one element in the effect of manual 
occupations upon the development of the will. We have 
already seen in Chapter VI how attention is the prime 
factor in development of motor control, that is, of skill 
in manual occupations. There appears to be only one 
other element of special interest in this connection. Work 
of this kind involves enterprises having remote ends, and 
a certain series of activities. The only way to attain the 
desired end is by careful attention to each step and by 
1 Angell, “Psychology,” page 402.
-P-A-G-E-160
    158 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
persistent effort. This necessity for close attention to all 
the conditions involved, for prompt response to the ‘will 
to act,” for untiring effort until the project is completed, 
is the special means of will training through these occu- 
pations.
-P-A-G-E-161
CHAPTER XI 
Economic AND INDUSTRIAL VALUES 
Isolation of the School.—Our schools have become 
strangely isolated from the industrial life of the vast 
majority of the people. Ninety per cent of our children 
do not enter high school. Fewer than half of those who 
enter remain to complete the course. The curriculum of 
     
              
    
     
   the elementary school is made to prepare students for 
the high school, that of the high school to prepare for 
college. The colleges, in the main, prepare for the pro- 
fessions. So far as school training goes, the ninety or 
ninety-five per cent of pupils who drop out early are 
prepared for none of the world’s industrial activities, in 
which, perforce, they must engage. Have we a right to 
claim that we are educating for efficiency ? 
Examples.—There is no industry in which a liberal 
special education pays a larger increase in return than 
farming. Probably not one farmer’s son in fifty is re- 
eiving, in the public schools, the special instruction and 
raining he needs to even start him right. The great 
ajority of boys in towns and cities will find their life 
ork in manual occupations. The schools are doing little 
coward preparing boys for any kind of manual work. The 
ocation of the great majority of women will continue to 
159
-P-A-G-E-162
  160 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
be “home-making,” and yet the arts of home-making are 
only beginning to find a place in our school curricula. 
A Problem.—How can the general introduction of 
manual arts and domestic science affect this situation? 
First, let us consider the case of boys on the farm. How 
can the rural school better prepare them for their life 
work? 
Elementary Agricultural Schools.—The answer is 
obvious, when one really thinks about it. The best kind 
of school for farmers’ sons is an elementary agricultural 
      
                     
   school. It should teach the usual academic subjects, to 
be sure, but it should in the last two or three years, to 
some extent, specialize in agriculture. For such a school 
the first requisite is a prepared teacher. At present such 
teachers are rare, but that is only a matter of readjust- 
ment. Teachers have always prepared for what was re- 
quired of them. In this case probably the best prepara- 
tion is a willingness to learn, The next absolute necessity 
is a small experimental farm, a “school garden,” if you 
prefer to call it such. Finally, there should be a text- 
book which presents the science of farming in a very, 
simple way, gives directions for simple, practical experi- 
ments, and provides a course in farm arithmetic applying} 
the theory. 
Results.—From such a school, a consolidated rural 
school if possible, the following results may be expected 
1. Farmers’ sons will continue in school longer, wil
-P-A-G-E-163
  ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL VALUES 161 
do their academic work as well or better, and instead of 
getting less academic training will probably get more. 
2. The interest aroused in the practical problems of 
the farm will lead many to continue the study in some 
more advanced agricultural school. Whether at school or 
on the farm they will continue to be students of the 
science of agriculture. 
3. The intellectual interests in scientific farming, 
together with the assurance of increased profits, will keep 
the brighter boys from leaving the farm to spend their 
lives in the city in occupations generally less profitable 
and less satisfying. 
4. Farming will be not only much more profitable, 
but vastly more enjoyable because the constantly develop- 
ing new ideas will relieve the old-time monotony, and 
give the satisfaction which always comes with progress 
and success. 
More Advanced Work.—If special work in agricul- 
ture be carried along in continuation classes in the cen- 
tralized rural schools, or in the local high schools, the 
majority of farmers’ sons might continue as students four 
or five months each year until seventeen or eighteen 
years of age. 
Special Courses for Girls—The same general princi- 
ples apply in regard to the education of girls. Just as 
agriculture is the most important, and under right condi- 
tions, the most interesting industry for men in the world,
-P-A-G-E-164
  162 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
so domestic science and household arts are the most .im- 
portant, and, under right conditions, the most interesting 
vocations for women. 
The same method of providing for such training 
applies as in the case of agriculture, with this difference, 
that no distinction need in this case be made between rural 
and urban schools. During the last two or three years 
in all elementary schools there should be for girls special 
classes for theoretical instruction and practical training 
in all that pertains to home-making. In the continuation 
classes in the consolidated rural schools, and in the local 
high schools, this work should gradually become more 
highly specialized. 
Results——From such an articulation of the school 
with the home, with the real normal life of young girl- 
hood, we should expect the following results: 
1. A very material lengthening of the school life 
of ninety per cent of American girls. 
2. Better general results in academic education, be- 
cause of extension of the time, the elimination of much 
useless and uninteresting material from the academic 
courses, and more vital interest in what remains. 
3. A very marked improvement in the home life of 
the people, because the school instruction and training 
would immediately carry over into the home. To be 
specific, there would result more sanitary conditions in and 
about the home, more wholesome, nutritious and less
-P-A-G-E-165
ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL VALUES 163 
expensive foods, better health, more attractive and more 
comfortable home furnishings. 
4. When the “homemakers” become more intelligent 
regarding their work, more skillful and more artistic 
in performing it, that work will take on the dignity of 
both science and art. Then the glory of the American 
woman will be her home. 
The Problem of the City Boy.—This leaves the boys 
of the villages, towns, and cities to be considered. The 
majority of these will find their life work in some kind 
of manual trade; the minority in commercial occupations. 
For reasons already stated, all should have training in 
manual arts. For the majority, this will be especially 
valuable in that it supplies a general fundamental training 
leading directly toward the manual occupations to which 
they are to devote their lives. Perhaps in the latter part of 
the elementary school course, certainly not later than the 
beginning of the continuation or high school work, there 
should be elective courses for these two classes of boys. 
First, greater specialization in manual training leading 
directly into the trade schools and technical schools, and 
second, commercial courses preparing boys who look for- 
ward to a business career. With these special courses there 
should, of course, be carried on only the most important, 
vital, appropriate portions of the present academic 
courses. 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
  164 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Results.—From some such gradual specialization in 
elementary and secondary school work the results may be 
easily inferred. 
1. A general extension of the school life of boys in 
urban communities, because boys will see the immediate 
value of the kind of training provided. 
2. A higher average of academic education, for rea- 
sons already given. 
3.. Fewer misfits in vocation, and fewer youths drift- 
ing along without definite aim as to vocation. 
4. More skillful and efficient workmen in manual 
trades as well as in commercial callings. 
5. A more intelligent, more prosperous, more opti- 
mistic mass of urban citizens : 
Another Problem.—Before leaving this part of the 
subject one other suggestion seems necessary. In the 
case of farmers’ sons there is no serious difficulty about 
a division of time so that the boys may spend part of 
their time at school and part on the farm helping with 
the work and getting the practical experience. The same 
is true of the training in “home-making” arts for girls. 
But as yet we have not in America, except in night 
schools, any plan by which boys and girls may continue 
in school part of the time while earning some money, 
rendering some practical service to others, and at the 
same time acquiring experience and skill in the line of
-P-A-G-E-167
ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL VALUES 165 
work for which they wish to prepare themselves as 
thoroughly as possible. 
Possible Solution—The European “continuation 
schools” are working out a plan of solving this problem. 
Students are divided into equal alternating groups. The 
members of Group A are in school for a time, while 
the members of Group B are at work in shop, in a busi- 
ness house, or at domestic service. Then for an equal 
period of time the members of these two groups exchange 
places. These alternations are repeated again and again 
during this period of the concurrent vocational and 
special school training. 
The details of such a plan must depend upon the 
peculiar conditions involved, especially on the employ- 
ment side. In the interests of the boys and girls it would 
seem desirable, when possible, that they work half -the 
day and study the other half, but weekly, fortnightly, or 
even monthly periods may prove quite satisfactory. 
With the organization of a system of schools along the 
lines of the general plan here outlined, there seems no 
reason why a very large majority of boys and girls should 
not voluntarily continue in school until seventeen or 
eighteen years of age. This would ensure much more 
academic culture than is now general, would develop 
much more of the student attitude, and provide for a 
large measure of vocational training.  
-P-A-G-E-168
  166 _ MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
It may be said that this proposed scheme of educa- 
tion does’ not provide for those who look forward to a 
professional career, or for those who wish education tor 
its cultural value. That is quite true. In this discussion 
it is assumed that the present system especially provides 
for these two classes. The early training in manual arts 
and industries is fundamental to the development of all, 
but for those to whom efficiency and satisfaction in life’s 
work depends upon the cooperation of hand and brain, 
training of this sort should be continued with increasing 
emphasis along gradually differentiating lines,
-P-A-G-E-169
  
CHAPTER XII 
SociaL VALUES 
Class Distinctions General—Social changes are 
necessarily of slow growth. Among all peoples the 
evolution of the social organization has always developed 
certain stratifications. There are always at least upper, 
middle, and lower classes of people. Various factors 
enter into this process of stratification. Primarily it is 
often a mere matter of wealth, or show of wealth. To 
some extent it may depend upon the evidences of literary 
and scientific culture. Another important factor is occu- 
pation, partly because of the estimation of the value of 
the service and the varying remuneration, and partly 
because of the difference in personal appearance that may 
be maintained while engaged in the occupation. There 
is a prevalent idea that any occupation in which one 
may always wear good clothes, or at least keep up good 
personal appearance, gives him a better social standing 
than one in which it is difficult or impossible to maintain 
appearances. 
The fact that these ideas cause distinct stratifications 
in society shows how strongly they characterize the social 
mind, and how difficult it is to bring about any significant 
changes in -social conceptions. 
167 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
    168 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Labor vs. Capital.—Another very important problem 
of the day is the adjustment of the relative interests of 
“labor” and “capital.” While this is primarily an 
economic problem, it has its distinct social significance. 
We hear much of the “dignity of labor,” but nothing 
of the dignity of capital. Is it because the latter is self- 
evident while the former has to be self-proclaimed? 
Is it because labor doubts its own dignity? Furthermore, 
is there not some real ground for this distinction? 
Whatever is essentially wrong can be corrected by 
the right kind of education. Judging the future by the 
past we recognize that important social changes are 
matters of evolution; not of revolution. Hence we are 
ready to urge and promote movements which can only 
come into full fruition in later generations. 
A Common Misconception.—The absurdity of the 
social distinction so commonly based upon occupation is 
admirably brought out in a story told by Miss Addams: 
“A Chicago manufacturer tells a story of twin 
boys whom he befriended and meant to give a start 
in life. He sent them to the Athenzeum for several 
winters as a preparatory business training, and then 
took them into his office, where they speedily became 
known as the bright one and the stupid one. The 
stupid one (so-called), was finally dismissed after 
repeated trials, when, to the surprise of the entire
-P-A-G-E-171
SOCIAL VALUES 169 
establishment, he quickly betook himself to the shop, 
where he became a wide-awake and valuable work- 
man. His chagrined benefactor, in telling the story, 
admits that he himself had fallen a victim to his own 
business training, and his early notion of rising in 
life. In reality he had merely followed the lead of 
most benevolent people who help poor boys. They 
test the success of their effort by the number whom 
they have taken out of factory work into some other 
higher occupation.” * 
This idea, that work in an office, or some other place, 
where one may keep his hands soft and his linen clean, 
is higher, more respectable, more worthy than efficient 
productive hand work in shop or factory or kitchen seems 
to have no basis in common sense, but we shall return to 
that topic for fuller discussion later. 
Evolution in Occupations.—The attitude of society 
toward various occupations may be clearly seen by study- 
ing the evolution of certain vocations. For example, 
there was a time when barbers acted as dentists and 
surgeons. Their dentistry was limited to extracting 
teeth, and their surgery generally to “blood-letting.” 
They were not supposed to be very skillful, and the fees 
for these services were probably about the same as for 
shaving and hair-cutting. Now, in practice, both dentis- 
‘Jane Addams, Democracy and Social Ethics, page 196.   
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  170 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
try and surgery are distinctly manual occupations, but 
society recognizes that successful practice requires much 
technical knowledge and a degree of skill that can only 
be acquired by long, careful training. 
Or let us take another example, where the evolution 
is all quite recent. Little more than a quarter of a 
century ago nearly all nursing was done by persons with- 
out special training. In social standing and in remunera- 
tion the old-time nurse took rank with other domestic 
help. Then within a few years special training schools 
for nurses were organized in connection with hospitals 
all over the country. Young women of fair academic 
education are taken in for a time “on probation.” If 
they show satisfactory qualifications, and wish to con- 
“tinue, they spend from two to three years learning the 
“theory and art of nursing.” What is the result? There 
is now a very large number of “trained nurses” who 
in professional ranking, might be designated assistant 
physicians or assistant surgeons; who are generally ad- 
mitted to the best society; and whose remuneration is 
two or three times that of the untrained nurse. 
Of course, we must remember that an important 
factor in the social evolution of these vocations is the 
inestimable value that may attach to the services they 
are prepared to render, but our point is that the ability 
to render those services is conditioned by the extent and 
thoroughness of the preparation.

SOCIAL VALUES 171 
     
                                               With this general survey of the conditions pertaining 
to our specific problem let us try to discover in what 
ways, if any, the general teaching of manual arts and 
industries can be expected to have any influence upon 
undesirable social conditions. 
Advantages to Laboring Classes.—First, what are 
the possible results as regards the social condition of 
the working classes in general? We have pointed out 
that the logical consequence of manual arts in the schools 
is the organization and maintenance of industrial schools 
in which some important academic work also will be 
carried on. From well conducted schools of this kind 
two results must surely flow. In the first place, men 
trained in such schools will be more skillful and efficient. 
Their earning power will be increased, their self-respect 
will be raised, their home life will be improved, and their 
general social standing will be enhanced. In the second 
place, the prolonged schooling in both academic and 
industrial work will result in a general rise in intelligence 
among the laboring classes. Notwithstanding our deep 
sympathy with “labor,” our general approval of the 
efforts made to improve the economic and social condi- 
tions of laboring people, our admiration for some of the 
leaders of organized labor, we cannot but deplore the 
fact that large labor organizations have sometimes been 
very badly led. This has been possible because men and 
women have not been quick to recognize the self-seeking,
-P-A-G-E-174
172 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
insincere man who appeals to their prejudices that he 
may impose upon them. Under these conditions the in- 
terests of the working people have often been sacrificed 
to capital. The only remedy for this is a higher average 
intelligence among the rank and file of working people. 
Results in Mode of Living.—The beneficial results 
of the general teaching, in the right way, of domestic 
science and household arts can scarcely be over-estimated. 
It has already been observed that in places where good 
courses in these lines have been provided, there is a 
marked change in the domestic life in many homes. The 
untrained mother does not know what foods have high 
nutritive value in proportion io their cost, which are 
easy and which difficult to digest, how best to prepare 
them to secure wholesome results. All of these things 
are taught the daughters in the domestic science classes. 
The immediate results may be mainly economic and 
hygienic, but the ultimate results in that home and in 
the future homes of the daughters will be social as well. 
We have said that one reason for the social recogni- 
tion of physicians and trained nurses is the value attached 
to their services. We may yet come to see that the 
services of a well trained cook in preserving and promot- 
ing health, especially among growing children, are even 
more valuable than those of the physician in his efforts 
to restore lost health.
-P-A-G-E-175
  SOCIAL VALUES 173 
Many a farmer knows thoroughly how to feed his 
young colts, calves, and pigs so as to ensure most healthy, 
vigorous growth. At the same time his children grow 
slowly, are pale, and anaemic, and neither father nor 
mother suspect that their condition is probably due to 
the kind of food they get. This, of course, is directly 
hygiene; indirectly it has important social relations be- 
cause prevailing illness is unfavorable to social develop- 
ment. 
Social Results in Rural Life.—Finally, let us con- 
sider the effect of better, agricultural education. Here 
again the results will be, first, increased profits, increased 
prosperity, better home conditions, greater self-respect, 
hence, greater respect from others. As in the case of 
other working people the prolongation of school life will 
result in a higher average of intelligence and culture. 
The centralized school will become a social center, there 
will be a library open to the community, an assembly 
room for the meeting of various clubs or other social 
organizations. The laboratory of the school will be open 
to the growing farmer to test his soils, fertilizers, etc., 
and to the young housewife to continue her domestic 
‘science studies. Such a school should be a genuine 
educational “extension” center. Increased prosperity 
will make it possible for rural people to devote more time 
to recreation, to reading, to travel, to art, and all that 
tends to social improvement.

General Conclusion.—In general, when a large ma- 
jority of our boys and girls continue in school longer, 
carrying along academic studies with vocational training, 
they can be led to choose vocations more wisely. They 
may be led to see that success depends upon skill and 
industry, that such an occupation as farming can utilize 
to the fullest extent a preparation as extensive and 
thorough as that required by a physician or a college 
instructor. Then, too, in this evolution, boys and girls 
may be led to see the folly of leaving the farm for the 
city, or of leaving shopwork or housework for work at 
a desk or at a counter, because it will be seen that, gen- 
erally, these changes are not favorable to material pros- 
perity, or in physical health, and that the apparent social 
advantages have no basis in reality.

CHAPTER XIII 
Hasir AND ‘ATTENTION IN RELATION TO MANUAL ARTS 
AND [NpustTRIES IN Epuc 
  TION 
In the beginning of this, our last distinctly psychologi- 
cal chapter, let us gather up and formally state some 
fundamental conceptions of psychology in relation to ed- 
ucation. 
Life-——We may define life as an activity having the 
power of self-direction, of adaptation, and of continuous 
development. It involves two interdependent factors, the 
physical and the psychical. 
Psycho-physical Parallelism.—Practically all modern 
psychologists are agreed that every psychical act is accom- 
panied by a corresponding physical activity within the 
central nervous system, that every change in the central 
nervous system is accompanied by corresponding psychi- 
cal activity. 
Physical Elements Essential to Life.— 
1. A nutritive system, the means of sustaining life 
and promoting growth. 
2. A nervous system, the means of communication: 
with the environment, and of motor control. 
3. A muscular system, the means of movement. 
Psychical Factors in Development.— 
1. Sensation, awareness of physical stimuli. 
175 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
    176 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
2. Cognition, all forms of knowing. 
3. Feeling, emotional attitude toward experience. 
4. Attention, the organizing mode of activity. 
5. Habit, the means of capitalizing experience. 
6. Volition, the power to determine action. 
Education.—The process of reorganizing experience. 
In a desirable education this reorganization tends to 
develop judgment, appreciation of what is of most real 
value in life, and the ability to attain and conserve those 
values. 
Habit and Attention—Out of their setting among 
these basal concepts let us take habit and attention for our 
special consideration. We have characterized habit as a 
_means of capitalizing experience. In our study of the de- 
velopment of motor control we saw that the attention is 
the most important factor in the development of control. 
Now it is the function of habit to gradually relieve the 
necessity for giving attention to an activity, and attention 
thus becomes free to devote its powerful and necessary 
energy in securing other forms of control. For ex- 
ample, if I were learning to write Hebrew, I should 
have to give close attention to the details of the forma- 
tion of the letters, but in English I have a writing habit 
that carries the process on rapidly while, attention is 
occupied with the organization of the thought and the 
mode of its expression. Habit has stored up and placed 
at my command the experience of my earlier years in
-P-A-G-E-179
HABIT AND ATTENTION 177 
learning to write. The idea that one can learn to write 
just as well while writing an original story as while 
giving all of his attention to the form and movement 
in writing is a psychological absurdity. 
Balance Between Habit and Attention.—The nor- 
mal condition is a sort of balance between attention and 
habit. They are mutually dependent: A new habit can 
be formed only with the aid of attention. The more in- 
tense the attention the sooner the activity can be 
largely turned over to habit,—and attention released 
to guide other activities. Any disturbance of this bal- 
ance tends to throw the mental machinery out of gear. 
Excessive habit formation tends to arrest development 
by limiting interests and activities to past experience, 
while a lack of habit would make it necessary to give an 
equal amount of attention to every action consciously 
performed. The problem of formal education in this 
connection is to maintain a proper balance between the 
tendency to form habits and the degree of attention re- 
quired in the development of conscious power in an ever 
enlarging range of activities. 
Value of Practice.—Opponents of manual arts and 
industries in the schools have sometimes taken the ground 
that there is but little educational value in manual ac- 
tivities because, they say, when one has done a thing 
once he has gained all he can educationally from that 
particular activity. If by this they mean that when a 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
  178 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
boy has once sawed to a line, has once driven a nail just 
right, or that when a girl has once cut out a waist, or 
made a loaf of bread, that after one successful effort 
there is nothing to be gained by efforts to repeat that 
success, they surely do not know the meaning of the 
development of confidence and skill. That first success 
may have been in part uncontrolled; several subsequent 
attempts may be failures. As well might one say that 
after a pupil has written one good piece of English 
prose he need write no more English prose, he 
has attained all the educational value from that. 
~kind of experience. We all believe that the first 
success will tend to secure a second success, that the 
power generated in these two successful efforts makes 
it easier to secure a third, and so on until writing good 
prose becomes more or less a habit; but it is doubtful 
that in this case attention can ever be to any marked 
extent released. In acquiring skill in a manual art the 
release of attention may be more rapid and more per- 
ceptible, but it is always a gradual process. 
A Possible Danger.—There is, perhaps, a real danger 
in emphasizing manual training in elementary schools, 
and it may be this that these critics have had vaguely 
in mind. The early attainment of skill is likely to 
center interest in that kind of activity, and arrest de- 
velopment along other lines. If a boy, for example, be- 
comes interested. in wood-work in the shop to the prac-
-P-A-G-E-181
HABIT AND ATTENTION 179 
tical exclusion of all other lines of work, if he attains 
a degree of skill in that work and therewith becomes 
satisfied, he may devote himself exclusively to that, leave 
school early to work in a shop or factory, and from that 
time on his general education is likely to be very much 
retarded. 
Example.—The appreticeship system furnishes a 
good example of this tendency. A boy of fourteen is 
bound to a master mechanic for a term of seven years 
to learn a trade. (It may be noted in passing that in 
the same time he could almost complete a high school 
and college course, and under favorable conditions, he 
could learn any mechanical trade while getting his 
high school and college training.) The boy is bound 
under contract, to his employer for seven years to learn 
to do one thing. He is not supposed to have any interest 
in any other kind of occupation. In general, where the 
apprenticeship system has been in use, the hours of 
work were too long to admit of time for other interests. 
There was no way of shortening the period of service, 
except by desertion, and no way of increasing the com- 
pensation by special efficiency. At twenty-one years of 
age the man was usually a good mechanic, but he was 
nothing more. The educative process was not abso- 
lutely stopped but it was very much retarded. On the 
physiological side a limited number of nervous cells had 
become closely associated, the pathways for stimuli had 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  180 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
become established, other large areas were relatively un- 
developed. 
  
Condition of Growth.—Continuous growth and de- 
velopment requires an ever widening range of interests 
and activities. The educative process becomes retarded 
only when interests center in, and become restricted to, 
some limited field of activities. But if one constantly 
flits from one interest and its related activity to another, 
then to another, he becomes a “jack of all trades and 
master of none.” The development of efficiency in any 
special line of activity requires practice, but, as we have 
seen, this practice should be at frequent, regular inter- 
vals and accompanied by concentrated attention. This 
is the direct route to skill in any field of endeavor. In 
childhood and early youth, however, no one line of in-. 
terest or activity should occupy a large proportion of 
time and attention. The child’s natural love of change 
is nature’s method of providing for an all round devel- 
opment. Different brain centers are constantly being 
stimulated and exercised, different associations estab- 
lished through the various possible pathways, different 
sensory and motor coordinations formed, the whole or- 
ganization maintained in a plastic condition favorable 
to growth. So far as possible, this condition should be 
presented during youth. While the development of 
control of some desirable activity, of a skillful habit of 
doing some thing, demands concentration and regular]
-P-A-G-E-183
ee eee 
HABIT AND ATTENTION 181 
practice, there should be carried along with that a vari- 
ety of other interests and activities. 
Application—The application of this important, 
far-reaching principle to manual arts and industries is 
obvious. When school work is exclusively of an academic 
character and the home provides no other special interests 
and occupations, a limited number of children have their 
interests centered in the little world of book learning. 
These, if they can, voluntarily continue in school, and, 
unless other interests are aroused later, their education 
is likely to be dominated by books. But, a very large 
number develop little genuine interest in academic stud- 
ies. These, and, for various reasons, many others, leave 
school early. Most of them devote themselves almost 
exclusively to some kind of manual occupation. Their 
interests, their attention, their chief activities, largely 
center in some more or less mechanical routine. Their 
life experiences may be somewhat more varied than that 
of the bound apprentice, and they may work at one 
thing for a time, then at another, but academic studies 
and other wholesome interests are, in most cases, ex- 
cluded. The educative process is accordingly restricted 
in its scope and retarded in its movement. Habit for- 
mation, within narrow limits, hampers attention and re- 
stricts the development of new interests and of new 
forms of control. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
182 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Suppose, however, that various kinds of manual and 
household arts are a part of the regular school work. 
At once the interests and activities are varied and mul- 
tiplied. Then, suppose, that practically all children con- 
tinue in school at least half of each day, or a considerable 
part of each year, until seventeen or eighteen years of 
age: think what that would mean for the continued 
growth and development of the nine-tenths of our boys 
and girls who now leave school early. Such a plan pro-' 
vides for continuous play of that balance of habit and 
attention which is a condition of growth and, at the same 
time, of the development of practical skill and efficiency.
-P-A-G-E-185
CHAPTER XIV 
To WHom TRAINING IN MANuAL Arts AND INDUSTRIES 
1s Most ImporTANT 
Physiological psychology clearly shows that early for- 
mal education should include a large amount of neuro- 
muscular training. This naturally includes much train- 
ing in manual activities. It has been pointed out in 
Chapter IT that the early conception of manual training 
in this country placed it first in technical and high schools. 
Then it gradually found its way into the upper grades 
of the elementary school, and it is only recently that many 
schools have allowed boys of the fifth and sixth grades 
to take work in the shops. To a considerable extent the 
practice has rather reversed the application of the true 
educational conception of manual arts and industries. 
Perhaps it would be better to say that we have not had 
too much manual training in the high school, but quite 
too little in the elementary school, and especially in the 
lower and intermediate grades of that school. 
Importance to Young Children.—Because the sens- 
ory and motor impulses are usually strong in young chil- 
dren they present a condition that must be met. Gener- 
ally the children will strive very hard to find some way 
of expressing these dominant impulses. If the school does 
not provide for their expression so much the worse for 
183
-P-A-G-E-186
  184 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
the school; it has a problem in repression. If it suc- 
ceeds in repression, so much the worse for the children. 
It is true that,eunder right conditions, many kinds of 
children’s games do much for the development of motor 
control, but it must be remembered that play has its limi- 
tations. Play alone can never express the impulse to 
make, to decorate, to own, to design and plan, to pro- 
duce something of value. For expression and develop- 
ment along these lines the young child needs much regu- 
lar training in various forms of manual arts. 
Probably the hardest task for most teachers of chil- 
dren, from seven or eight to ten or eleven years of age, 
is to interest their pupils in much of the text-book work 
provided in the usual course of study, but there is rarely 
any difficulty about interesting these same pupils in man- 
ual training, domestic science, or school gardening. They. 
are eager to do things, to make or produce things. It 
follows, then, that since the dominating impulses of young 
children demand much in the way of manual activity, 
and do not demand much in the way of book knowledge, 
that during the first four or five years of the elementary 
school course there should be distinct emphasis upon those 
lines aby that require physical activity in games and 
occupations. 
Precaution.—Here, again, a word of caution seems 
necessary. In some school systems the demand for man- 
ual occupations in the first half of the elementary school
-P-A-G-E-187
TO WHOM MOST IMPORTANT 185 
course has quite outrun the preparation to meet it. Such 
work as paper cutting and folding is no doubt interesting 
and valuable in the kindergarten and even in first and 
second grades, but for older children it does not seem 
“worth while.” The same general criticism applies to 
much of the work with cardboard and to the whittling ex- 
ercises. It is not enough that children shall have “occu- 
pation in manual activities.” Nay, more, it is not enough 
that children seem to like the occupation provided. This 
attitude sometimes expresses only a covert satisfac- 
tion in escaping for the time the “book lessons.” 
Many children would rather ‘serve time” at almost 
any kind of handwork than at some kinds of study. 
The occupations should have definite aims looking to 
the production of something that seems to the children 
themselves genuinely worth while. 
A Question of Aim.-—But, say the advocates of book 
education, young children are unable to do anything in 
manual arts and domestic science that is really worth 
while. They cannot be expected to have sufficient knowl- 
edge of materials, control cf tools and of processes to 
produce things of real value. In many cases, measured 
by adult standards, that may be true. But that is not 
the point of view here urged. The aim of this work 
in the schools is the development of efficient boys and 
girls, not the production of tables and tabourets, of pies 
and pinafores. The best teachers of drawing in elemen- 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
186 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
tary schools long since repudiated the idea that their aim 
is that their pupils shall produce works of art. They 
aim to give training in. expression through lines, light 
and shade and colors, to develop a sense for good form 
and proportion, for harmony in color, and an apprecia- 
tion of what is good in industrial design. So in all our 
schoolwork, it is not what the child produces that is the 
real aim of the school, but the effect of the effort upon 
the learner, the development of an appreciation of real 
values, and of the power to control those values. Hence 
it is of supreme importance that the work undertaken 
should seem of real value to the child. And it is with 
this condition distinctly understood that training in man- 
ual arts and industries is urged as of supreme importance 
for children from seven to twelve years of age. 
Application.—Here arises a minor question. Does 
this principle apply equally to all children? The an- 
swer must be, No. That is to ‘say, all children should 
have abundant opportunity for the expression of their 
impulses to sense perception, to motor activity, to make 
and produce things, but home conditions still do much 
more for some children in this respect than for others. 
In a well conducted country home the children early 
come to’share to some extent in the simpler and lighter 
forms of occupations. They thus get many experiences 
that are practically impossible to most children in an 
urban home. Even the boys and girls, however, in the
-P-A-G-E-189
TO WHOM MOST IMPORTANT 187 
best country home may be greatly helped by some system- 
atic training in shopwork, gardening, sewing, and cook- 
ing. Where the rural home conditions are not good 
the need for this school training may be in every respect 
as urgent as it is for any class of city children. 
The Centralized School.—One of the important ad- 
vantages of the centralized rural school is that in it 
adequate provision can much more readily and economi- 
cally be made for all these lines of work than in the 
small district school, and the work can be more special- 
ized for the older children. The girls can work out, 
in both theory and practice, the manifold problems of 
domestic economy, of home sanitation and decoration; 
while the boys attack the equally manifold and interest- 
ing problems of general and special agriculture, and, at 
the same time, in the shop get some of the mechanical 
skill that every farmer should have. 
Special Value to City Child—The urban child, how- 
ever, is now especially cut off from home opportunities 
for manual experiences. Even in villages this is com- 
monly true. The garden spot is usually small, and for 
one reason or another the garden work is generally 
done exclusively by adult members of the family. Chil- 
dren are not trained to take their share of the valuable 
experiences such work offers. Food and clothing are 
to a very large extent prepared outside the home. Even 
playthings of almost every kind come into the home 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  188 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
ready made. There was a time, not very remote, when 
the boys made their own baseballs and bats, their hockey 
sticks, their wagons and sleds. Then, too, little girls 
made and dressed their own dolls, made and furnished 
their own doll’s house. Vastly more important than 
this was the fact that both girls and boys had their re- 
spective shares in the duties and responsibilities of the 
home life. In many homes nearly all of this has been 
eliminated, with great disadvantage to the children. 
The school has been established and is maintained 
to provide certain experiences, that in the changed social 
and industrial conditions cannot be supplied in the 
home. Therefore it is peculiarly necessary that various 
forms of manual and household arts, judiciously selected 
and directed, should form a part of the daily work. 
Importance to Lower Races.—To understand the 
special value of training in manual arts and industries 
to children in relatively lower stages of civilization it 
is necessary to consider three points: 
First, that in persons in the lower stages of civiliza- 
tion the motor and sensory impulses and interests occupy 
a larger place in the sum of their activities than in 
those in whom the higher nervous centers have been more 
fully developed. To attempt to give persons in this 
stage of human evolution very much in the way of 
literary and scientific training is likely to prove futile. 
Preparation for that kind of education can come only
-P-A-G-E-191
  TO WHOM MOST IMPORTANT 189 
through generations of training in which there is a con- 
stant effort to work from sensori-motor activities to re- 
flective activities. The sensori-motor experiences must 
be more varied, must stimulate more numerous and 
more varied intellectual and emotional experiences. In 
other words, the person in a lower stage of civilization 
continues in the condition of the child of civilization, 
hence the training best adapted to such a child is, in gen- 
eral, likely to be the best for the member of the lower 
race. ss 
Second, if it is true that differentiation and special- 
ization in nervous tissue depends primarily, in part at 
least, upon the number and variety of neuro-muscular 
experiences it follows that either races or individuals 
in a lower stage of development need just that sort 
of experience as a means of evolution or development to 
a higher stage. 
Third, in probably the vast majority of cases the 
individuals of the less developed race will find their life 
work in occupations that involve mainly skill in man- 
ual training and domestic arts. When once it becomes 
recognized that training in these things means educa- 
tion there will be an increasing number willing to go 
lon with work in special schools. The intellectual inter- 
ests in the manual occupations will to some extent carry 
ver to academic studies and the ultimate results will 
be not only more skillful working people, but a higher 
eneral average of intelligence and culture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  190 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
  
Specific Application.. 
of this principle, it seems beyond question that the rise To make a specific application 
and progress of millions of the colored boys and girls 
of this country must be through education in various 
forms of industrial occupations. To such a people as 
a race that seems the way to genuine freedom, to ac- 
ceptable service, to personal self-realization, to home 
comforts and the possession of property. 
Importance to the Sub-normal Child.—In theory it 
must appear quite probable that the kind of training 
that should be emphasized in the education of the young 
child of civilization, and in the education of both child- 
hood and youth in lower races, will be most beneficial 
in the education of the feeble-minded child. Careful 
experimentation and extensive experience in a number of 
institutions for feeble-minded children very completely 
establish this theory. 
As regards intellect, the most obvious symptom of 
feeble-mindedness is the lack of the power of atten- 
tion. Now, it has been frequently observed that some 
form of manual occupation, the manipulation of mater- 
ials to some definite end, is the best means of develop- 
ing the power of attention in the sub-normal child. 
When a child can be led through some manual work in 
which he takes an interest, to regular oft-repeated ex- 
periences of this kind, day in and day out, he cannot 
fail to give attention and to develop a power and a habit
-P-A-G-E-193
  TO WHOM MOST IMPORTANT 191 
of attention that carries over to other interests and ac- 
tivities. The reason is that the sensori-motor experiences 
give a body of images, related and associated, which be- 
come the raw material of constructive imagination, con- 
ception, judgment, and reason. From the point of view 
of his intellectual development, therefore, the best that 
can be done for the sub-normal child is to give him ex- 
tensive training in various motor activities, including 
manual arts and industries. If the work provided ap- 
peals to him as worth while for its own sake so much 
the better. But if he seems indifferent to all projects 
some indirect interest should be appealed to. - 
Here again the probable future of the individual 
emphasizes the value of this kind of training, for, if 
the sub-normal child is ever to become independent, 
self-reliant, and self-sustaining it will probably be 
through some form of manual activity.
-P-A-G-E-194
CHAPTER XV 
GeNERAL METHOD 
Reference has several times been made to the way in 
which instruction and training in manual arts and in- 
dustries should be given. While it is entirely beyond the 
scope of this work to give detailed plans and directions, 
it seems desirable to suggest some general principles that 
may serve as guides in planning and carrying on the 
work. As in every new movement of this sort, there has 
been in school work in manual arts great waste of 
time and effort because teachers have not known 
what is most worth doing, and how best to do it 
to secure the most valuable results in the development of 
the pupils. This is but natural. The whole movement 
has been, and is still largely, in a process of experimental 
evolution. In such a process we find our way only 
through the recognition of misdirected efforts and fail- 
ures as well as successes. There are still many problems 
to solve and any earnest, alert, thoughtful teacher can 
contribute to the further development of the movement 
in its various ramifications. 
Motive.—The fundamental conception underlying all 
method should be motive, that impelling force within us| 
which prompt all purposeful action. A part of the great 
problem of education is the recognition, utilization, and| 
development of right motives to activity, to conduct in| 
192
-P-A-G-E-195
  
GENERAL METHOD 193 
its broadest meaning. It has been shown that children 
are naturally impelled to various forms of manual activi- 
ties. If observation be carried farther it will be clear 
that some lines of these activities attract nearly all chil- 
dren, some attract very few. Moreover, while nearly 
all children like to plant things and to see them grow, 
this kind of work may be directed and conducted in 
such a way as to kill interest and develop the utmost 
indifference, or in such a way as to continually increase 
in interest and satisfaction. Every one knows how com- 
monly boys like to use tools, how eagerly they welcome 
the opportunities of the manual training shop, and yet the 
writer has known a number of normal boys who began 
this work with great enthusiasm, to ask to be excused 
from the shop after a few weeks’ experience. In a few 
cases, when an attempt was made to compel attendance, 
they played truant during the shop period. 
There can be little question that such a condition is 
due to a failure on the part of the school to utilize or 
develop right motives, or to carry on the work in a satis- 
factory way. The writer has frequently asked boys in 
a shop what they were making and been told, “I don’t 
know.” The boys had simply been given pieces of wood 
and told to make them of a certain size. Later, they 
were told that the piece was to be part of a box, a 
book-rack, or a bird house, but in the beginning there 
was no real motive for the work.
-P-A-G-E-196
  194 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Principles Relating to Motive——This prepares us 
for the statement of three general principles governing 
method : 
First, the work should be such as the great majority 
of pupils will naturally wish to do, and will give satisfac- 
tion when completed. The second part of this is as 
important as the first. There may be exceptions to the 
tule, but generally speaking, when a pupil casts aside, as 
of no value, the piece of handwork he has completed, 
he might better not have begun it. His attitude toward 
subsequent projects is not so good as it would have 
been had he not had that more or less disappointing 
experience. 
Second, if the work is not obviously such as seems 
to the pupils worth while, it should be so explained to 
them that they see the value of it. In this way a good 
direct interest and personal motive may often be devel- 
oped. 
Third, if what seems the most desirable work for a 
certain group of pupils at a certain stage does not appeal 
to some immediate personal motive, recourse must be had 
to some good indirect motive. For example, they may 
produce things for the use of the school, or to donate 
to some charity, or for a friend or relative. 
In accordance with these principles it follows that 
the teacher determines in a general broad way the work 
to be done, that is to say, makes the general course of
-P-A-G-E-197
  GENERAL METHOD 195 
study, but makes it with reference to the known interests, 
aptitudes, and powers of the pupils. 
Within this general plan, however, each pupil should 
be allowed as much freedom as possible, not only in the 
selection of his special projects, but also as to the method 
of working them out. It must be remembered that the 
aim of the school is the development of the pupil, and 
that he is developed, not by what others do for him, but 
only by what he does for himself. When everything 
is prescribed for him in detail very much of the value 
of the work is lost. 
Exercises vs. Personal Projects.—This leads us to 
consider the value and place of “exercise” projects as 
compared with the so-called “useful” projects. The 
“exercise” in. manual training and domestic arts is a 
“practice piece” designed to develop skill as a prepara- 
tion for making things of value in themselves. The 
Russian system of manual training, for example, con- 
sisted almost wholly of instruction in the uses and care 
of tools and work upon “exercises.” The student was 
not supposed to undertake to make anything that could 
be put to any practical use. Swedish Sloyd was consid- 
ered a marked advance upon the Russian system in that 
the things made were supposed to be useful household 
articles. In America, however, Sloyd was soon super- 
seded because it was found that many of these “useful” 
articles were rarely used in the American home. Owing 
to the comparative failure of these systems some ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
196 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
vocates swung away from all forms of exercises, urging 
that boys should learn to make joints by making joints as 
they occur in boxes, book cases, tables, chairs, etc., and 
that girls should learn to make buttonholes, by making 
buttonholes as needed in a waist or other garment. 
Neither of these plans show ordinary common sense. 
The plan which keeps pupils long practicing upon ex- 
ercise pieces alone violates utterly our fundamental prin- 
ciple that, generally, the work should appeal to the pupils 
as aiming to produce something that is genuinely worth 
while in itself. On the other hand, when pupils under- 
take to make things for which they have not acquired 
the necessary technical skill, they frequently destroy much 
good material, waste much time, become discouraged by 
their failures, and finish their projects in an unsatisfac- 
tory way. 
The practice exercise has its value in its proper time 
and place. It is vicious only when made an end in itself 
or when to the pupil the real end is so remote as to 
fail to affect his motive. When pupils begin shop work 
in wood they are quite willing to do a little practicing 
in sawing to a line, in planing a surface smooth, 
and in trying to get two smooth surfaces at right angles 
to each other. They feel that they need this skill before 
they do anything worth while. The motive to work is 
very real and personal. Similarly, when a girl gets to 
where she needs to be able to make a good, neat button- 
hole, she is quite willing to take a piece of practice
-P-A-G-E-199
  GENERAL METHOD 197% 
cloth and work buttonholes until she is satisfied she can 
do it well enough to put them into her garment. The 
desired skill has a value just as real and personal as the 
garment itself. 
Fourth Principle-—Wence we have our next prin- 
ciple.—Work in manual arts should be mainly upon pro- 
jects that the pupils themselves wish to undertake looking 
to the production of something of real value to them. 
But, practice exercises should also be given. This prac- 
tice for skill in some step in a process should be given 
generally only when there is immediate need of it, so 
that the pupils feel the relation between the practice 
and the end for which the skill is necessary. 
Models.—The use of models is another factor in 
method. If the preceding principles are understood the 
proper use of models will be obvious. First, good models 
are always valuable as objects of study, to give basal 
conceptions of things to be made and to set ideals of 
workmanship. For example, when a girl is preparing to 
make an apron she should be given an opportunity to 
examine a number of well-designed, well-made aprons. 
Or when a boy is about to make plans for a Morris 
chair he should study several such chairs. If the pupils 
can have the guidance of the teacher in the study of 
models so much the better. Second, models may be 
valuable as guides in the practice of special exercises. 
In woodworking shops there should be models of saw- 
ing, planing, squaring face by face, joining, etc. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  Se 198 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
the sewing room there should be models of seams, hems, 
gathers, buttonholes, patching, darning, and the like. 
Plans.—Whether work in manual arts and industries 
has intellectual value depends much upon how and by 
whom the planning is done. This at once suggests that 
the maximum of educative value is attained when the 
pupils work out their own plans as independently and as 
completely as possible. This does not mean the pupils 
are to be turned loose upon new lines of work without 
suggestion or direction of any kind; rather, that the 
planning should proceed somewhat as follows: 
~ First, there should be, according to the nature of the 
work, a general discussion of the aims and purposes of 
the work, and of the materials to be used. This applies 
very generally to all kinds of manual and industrial 
undertakings. If the nature of the subject permits, there 
may be, in this connection, an examination and compari- 
son.of various samples or models. 
Second, with the aid of the teacher, general plans 
should be worked out, usually by the class as a whole. 
Third, each individual should work out his own plan 
in writing, with drawings when these are necessary, and 
submit it to the teacher for criticism and suggestion. 
Special care should be taken to secure originality in plan. 
» Fourth, after the plan is approved the pupil should 
still feel free to change his plan, but only with the ap- 
proval of the teacher. 
Supervision—We say, “children will be children.”  
-P-A-G-E-201
  
  GENERAL METHOD 199 
Would it not be better to say children are children. One 
of the dominant impulses of childhood is the impulse to 
play. This impulse is strongly stimulated by contact with 
other children even unto the days of maturity. In the 
shop, the sewing-room, or the kitchen the usual restraints 
of the school seem to be somewhat relaxed. For these 
reasons in themselves there must be constant and alert 
supervision of class work of this sort. But this implies 
only negative supervision. The delight in and value of 
the work are largely due to the fact that the pupils 
are constantly meeting unfamiliar situations, facing new 
difficulties. They continually need judicious guidance 
and help. The reasonable demands of a small class for 
help often tax the skill and energy of the most efficient 
teacher. 
When the members of a class are working upon 
similar projects much time and labor may often be saved 
by anticipating some of the common difficulties and 
giving such suggestions as will enable the pupils to meet 
them when they encounter them. This plan must be 
used sparingly and with great discretion. There are 
few greater mistakes in teaching than that of standing 
before a class and talking when the pupils are eager to 
do things. 
One’ other precaution is necessary. Some one has 
said, “It is not much learning, but much interference 
that makes the pupil mad.” When a pupil feels that he 
knows what he is doing he does not wish to be checked.
-P-A-G-E-202
200 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
Unnecessary criticism irritates and discourages him. 
Even when he is not doing just exactly what is best, from 
the point of view of the teacher, it may be better to let 
him go on until he discovers his own error, unless the 
experience is likely to be very costly in time or material. 
Cooperation——One of the socializing influences of 
work in manual arts and industries arises from the oppor- 
tunity such work offers for cooperation. In projects of 
considerable magnitude, especially when undertaken in 
the interest of the school, or for some other purpose 
of common interest, a number of pupils work together, 
each doing a part. In such cases, however, each pupil 
should thoroughly understand the whole project, and, so 
far as possible, be interested in it as though it were all 
his own. When this is done in the right way it tends 
to develop the true social spirit; the spirit that is the 
basis of all interest in community life. 
There is also a minor form of cooperation which has 
its value. Sometimes a pupil has a project in which he 
needs a little temporary help from time to time. Where 
the right attitude prevails pupils may safely be encour- 
aged to exchange help at such times without special per- 
mission. Or, when the instructor is very busy, a pupil 
may apply to another pupil for criticism on his work or 
for guidance when in doubt. 
In this connection two precautions are necessary. 
First, the aim of each pupil should be to promote the 
interest of all to do nothing that will hinder or unneces-
-P-A-G-E-203
  GENERAL METHOD 201 
sarily interrupt another. Second, group projects must 
not occupy so much time that the naturally strong indi- 
vidual interest and motive is lost. 
Rewards and Incentives.—In general, owing to the 
nature of the work in manual arts and industries, special 
rewards and incentives are unnecessary. Pupils not only 
wish to do the work, but they usually take pride in trying 
to do it well. Where these conditions prevail artificial 
stimulation is as unnecessary as it is to the appetite of 
a-healthy, growing boy playing or working in God’s out- 
of-doors. There are cases, however, where certain forms 
of special rewards and incentives have value and a legiti- 
mate place. 
Exhibits of Work.—Shows, exhibitions, expositions of 
various kinds have become a part of modern civilization. 
Farmers show their grains, fruits, vegetables, and live 
stock. Manufacturers exhibit their products and some- 
times their processes. Nations spend immense sums to 
place their resources in expositions. It is quite proper 
that boys and girls should be encouraged to make periodic 
displays of what they produce. There seems no valid ob- 
jection to this incentive to pupils to do their very best, 
and the exhibit is sometimes a means of securing fuller 
sympathy and cooperation on the part of parents, school 
officers, and the community in general. It should not 
be necessary to add that every care should be exercised 
to secure genuineness in every part of the exhibit. 
Prizes.—Educators generally discourage the giving 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  y 
y 202 “ MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
of special prizes for evidences of success in study. The 
writer is entirely in sympathy with that view of the 
matter, but feels that, in some respects, the case of manual 
arts and industries is different, and that, in the promotion 
of this great educational movement, exception may rea- 
sonably be made. For example, there seems no good 
reason why the members of a “corn club” should not 
make exhibits of their products at the County Fair, or 
elsewhere, and compete for prizes the same as their 
fathers do. Then, if this be a good wholesome experience 
for the boys, why should not the girls make displays of 
their work in household arts to be judged for prizes, and 
the boys exhibit collections of shop work? 
Sale of Products.—When pupils produce articles of 
value they should, if they wish, be allowed to sell them. 
In some cases it would be a good thing for teachers to 
consider the probable commercial value of the projects 
they assign to their classes. Could this thing be sold, 
and for how much? would often be good questions to 
ask the teacher. 
This principle has its limitations. It must be under- 
stood, of course, that it does not apply to work by young 
children. They should generally not be expected to 
produce things of commercial value. But when pupils 
are old enough to cultivate a piece of land they should 
be allowed to sell as much of the product as they like; 
and in some more advanced manual arts work pupils 
should be encouraged to make things that are saleable.

CHAPTER XVI 
SUMMARIZING THE TENTATIVE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM 
In beginning the book I tried to make it clear that 
there is, in the minds of educators, a real problem as to 
the significance and place of manual arts and industries 
in a system of education; that our present system is gen- 
erally lop-sided, over-literary, impractical, and lacking 
in interest and personal motive to the majority of pupils. 
Having shown that there is a real problem, I stated it 
in its three-fold aspects: first, the major question, what 
are the educational values of instruction and training in 
certain lines of manual arts and industries? second, in 
what part of the school course, and to what class of 
children is this training relatively most important? third, 
what general methods of ‘training should prevail in 
order to secure the maximum of education values? 
It should be clear to the reader that Chapters II to 
XIII inclusive are, throughout, devoted to the first phase 
of the whole problem, and that each of the minor phases 
is treated in a single chapter. It is not assumed that this 
is the ultimate solution of the problem, rather that it 
contributes somewhat to the working knowledge that 
makes progress toward the solution possible. 
203

  204 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: 
The historical chapter aims to give a perspective view 
of the whole matter. The brief statements regarding 
Egyptian and Hebrew civilization suggest the signifi- 
cance of manual arts and industries in racial evolution. 
This view may be clarified and enlarged by the study 
of any early civilization, or of any primitive people. 
What is given is intended to point to the fact that in a 
very real sense man has lifted himself by his hands. 
Moral Reform.—The movement to make training in 
certain industries a part of school work is at least 400 
years old. Martin Luther advocated it as a means of 
moral reform, pointing out that skill and industrious 
habits conduce to self-respect, self-reliance, and_ self- 
support, and that inefficiency leads to idleness, and idle- 
ness to vice and crime. This view was urged by many 
moral and religious reformers in different countries for 
many years. 
  
Wider View.—Gradually such educational reformers 
as Comenius, Pestalozzi, and Froebel enlarged the con- 
ception. They saw in manual activities the natural me- 
dium for the expression of the child’s impulses to self- 
activity, a means of utilizing especially the impulses to 
motor activity, a means of giving children real first-hand 
knowledge of things, as well as some skill and a right 
attitude toward manual work. 
Progress in America.—In America the introduction
-P-A-G-E-207
SUMMARIZING THE ANSWER 205 
of manual training had, for some years, mainly a voca- 
tional motive. That was in itself a good motive, and 
the promoters of the movement deserve unstinted praise 
for what they did. Gradually, however, a broader view 
has developed, and, to some extent, been applied. It is 
seen that motor activities are relatively more important 
to young children than to those of high school age, that 
among the most educative forms of motor expression are 
the various kinds of manual arts and industries appropri- 
ate to the different stages of development. Aceording to 
the present trend of the movement the vocational aspect, 
in secondary schools, is entitled to much more attention 
than it now receives; but vastly more, the non-vocational 
training in manual experiences in elementary schools 
needs careful study and strong emphasis. 
History shows the value of manual arts and indus- 
trices as means of human development. 
FUNDAMENTAL MEANING 
We have come to understand education as the pro- 
cess of reorganizing experience in such a way as to de- 
velop appreciation and conservation of the things of most 
value in the life of the individual and of society. Now, 
experience is primarily an individual, personal thing, It 
is the reaction of the individual upon his environment. 
It is the immediate product of self-activity, and all self- 
activity is- prompted, impelled, by some impulse, some 
conscious or unconscious sense of need, some desire to  
-P-A-G-E-208
  206 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
acquire power to control things or to possess things that 
seem of value. 
Modern pedagogy recognizes that these fundamental 
impulses should have opportunity for expression, should 
be directed and utilized in such ways that the immediate 
experiences are valuable in themselves and, at the same 
time, that they develop right attitudes toward subsequent 
desirable experiences. 
_ The Impulses.—In relation to our problem we con- 
sidered such fundamental impulses as the general im- 
pulses to activity, the impulse to get sense stimulations, 
the impulse to motor activity, to play, to imitate, to con- 
struct or to make things, to experiment or see what 
things will do in different conditions, the social impulse, 
the aesthetic impulse, the ownership impulse. To these, 
perhaps, we might have added the impulse to think and 
to work. These are all united in the general impulses 
to activity, with a view to solving problems, satisfying 
needs, attaining desired controls. 
Relation to Manual Art.—Each and all of these im- 
portant and varied impulses find peculiarly favorable and 
appropriate opportunities for expression in the various 
forms of manual arts and industries that may be intro- 
duced into the school. Social and economic conditions 
have, within a few years, so changed, that, to a very large 
extent, these opportunities have been eliminated from 
the life in the home. The school is maintained as the
-P-A-G-E-209
  SUMMARIZING THE ANSWER 207 
complement of the home. It is the business of the 
school to supply, so far as possible, the valuable experi- 
ences that are not supplied in the home. 
The nature of the young child demands for his best 
all-round development regular, systematic, varied experi- 
ences in manual arts and industries. 
SENSE TRAINING 
*  Importance.—Educators agree in recognizing the im- 
portance of training the various sense powers. So vital 
has this been considered that, in the mistaken belief that 
one power could best be isolated and trained alone, vari- 
ous schemes, such as object lessons and special sense- 
training exercises, have been devised and carried on for 
a time with great enthusiasm. 
The Natural Method.—Whether this matter is con- 
sidered from the point of view of evolution or from that 
of the development of vocational skill, it appears that the 
power of sense discrimination is best developed when the 
senses are exercised not directly for the sake of the 
sense distinctions alone, but as a means to the attain- 
ment of some end of value in itself. Moreover, it ap- 
pears further that the total result of special sense-train- 
ing exercises, if carried on extensively, may be arrest 
of general development. On the other hand, in-work in 
manual arts and industries there is abundant training of 
sight, touch, and of the muscular sense, under conditions 
that ensure a right attitude toward the experience and 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  208 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
keep the different elements of experience in their ap- 
propriate relations and true perspective. 
Manual arts and industries afford the natural and 
effective means of sense training. 
DEVELOPMENT OF MOTOR CONTROL 
Equally fundamental with sense training in human 
development is the development of motor control. It is 
impossible to conceive of development or efficiency in 
human life apart from motor control. No argument or 
evidence is needed to satisfy us that regular, systematic 
training in manual arts and industries develops such 
control. The purpose of that part of our investigation 
was to determine the conditions under which such con- 
trol develops most rapidly and to discover the relation 
of the motor activities to other accompanying activities. 
The Dominant Factor.—The conclusion that at- 
tention is the dominant factor in the development of 
motor control is most significant. Remembering that at- 
tention involves all modes of intellectual activity we see 
the relation of manual activities to mental development. 
A mental activity must accompany and guide every con- 
scious manual activity. There must be coordination and 
cooperation among brain cells before there can be co- 
operation between nerve and muscle. Practice without 
attention is folly. 
Effort.—The connection between concentrated atten- 
tion and strenuous effort will be evident, and the impor-
-P-A-G-E-211
  SUMMARIZING THE ANSWER 209 
tance of this connection should be carefully considered. 
To require children to strive for a certain kind of motor 
control, such as writing with a fine pen, before they are 
physically ready for that kind of experience, is likely to 
result in more or less permanent disability to acquire 
ease and skill in that control. 
Frequency and Regularity—The value of fre- 
quency and regularity in practice was clearly demon- 
strated. And the importance of training in large move- 
ments first, and then of gradually reducing the ampli- 
tude of the movements, hence of the nervous and mus- 
cular areas involved, was clearly implied. 
Training in manual arts and industries is an obvious 
means of developing motor control, but the dominant 
factor in the process is concentrated attention. 
Normal development proceeds from large to small 
areas among nerves and muscles. Young children 
should not use small materials or fine instruments. 
PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESULTS 
Education has been defined as the development of 
the central nervous system. One condition of this de- 
velopment is exercise of the system appropriate in kind 
and amount. Every effort to do something not done 
before tends to establish new connections among nerve 
or brain centers, to bring undeveloped cells into func- 
tioning activity, and to strengthen structures already 
formed. This condition is especially important during
-P-A-G-E-212
  210 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
} 
the first twelve or fourteen years of life, and still very 
important until maturity. During the early years there 
should be a great variety of experiences. The child 
should try to do many things, should learn something 
of many things, should not strive for a high degree of 
skill in any one form of activity. 
In early life motor activities naturally predominate 
over the reflective, but for every muscular activity there 
is a corresponding change in the nervous system. More- 
over, physical activity is essential to the healthy devel- 
opment of the brain and nerves as well as of the rest of 
the organism. 
Manual arts and industries supply the occasion for a 
great variety of experiences, both motor and mental, 
and hence develop the whole nervous system. 
INTELLECTUAL RESULTS 
In this summary the relation of training in manual 
arts to sense training has already been pointed out. The 
intellectual value of this is obvious, but there are other 
important intellectual results. Under right conditions 
every step in the work demands attention which exer- 
cises every mental power. All these mental and motor 
activities tend to the development and organization of 
the nervous system for more effective work with both 
hand and brain. Especially is it true that the experi- 
ences in hand-work, including the study of related ma- 
terials and objects, supplies a wealth of varied images
-P-A-G-E-213
SUMMARIZING THE ANSWER 21d 
available in constructive imagination. Then, too, the 
extensive first hand acquaintance with many materials, 
as they are brought into working relations, exercises and 
gives the best basis for practical judgment. Finally, 
the very nature of the work in the shop, on the farm, in 
the kitchen, or the sewing-room, when done under right 
conditions, necessitates more or less reasoning, that 
“purposive thinking” in the interests of a plan, a problem 
to be worked out, a difficulty to be removed. 
Rightly conducted, manual arts and industries furnish 
abundant exercise for all forms of intellectual activity, 
under conditions most favorable to mental development. 
AESTHETIC SIGNIFICANCE 
Apart from manual arts the art work in our schools 
is largely isolated, is unrelated to other activities, lacks 
a genuine motive. Construction work and various forms 
of industrial occupations give real occasion for the use 
of representative drawing, for design, for mechanical 
drawing, for studying color, decoration, etc. The desire 
and the attempt to use art leads to genuine study of 
the subject, both in school and out. Interests are devel- 
oped that are abiding and operative throughout life. 
Work in manual arts and industries gives real motives 
for studying and applying art, and develops abiding 
aesthetic interests.

  212 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
ETHICAL VALUES 
Whether hand-work in the schools has ethical value 
depends largely upon how the work is done. If the 
work is always genuine, free from sham and pretense, 
if pupils are held strictly responsible for regular attention 
to, and prompt completion of their work, the results 
cannot fail to be morally wholesome. The advantage 
of manual work over book work in this respect is that 
failure in the former is more easily known than in the 
latter. This is especially true in regard to the thorough 
completion of an undertaking, where exercise of the 
will is especially involved. Moreover, if the manual 
work is continued far enough in the school course it 
tends to develop a habit of industry and a right attitude 
toward manual labor. 
Under right conditions, training in manual arts and 
industries has important ethical values. 
ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL EFFECTS 
Schools Lopsided.—To think of a school is to think 
of books. One who has had much schooling is expected to 
be a scholar. This shows the ideal of the school that has 
prevailed. It is traditional; the work of the early schools 
was almost wholly literary, but then schools were for the 
few. Conditions have changed; our public schools are 
for all the children of all the people, and they must 
provide for much more than did the early school. The 
school of the future must provide all necessary expe- 
riences that are not provided in the home life.
-P-A-G-E-215
SUMMARIZING THE ANSWER 213 
Important Changes.—Changes in social, economic, 
and industrial conditions have eliminated many activities 
in the way of manual arts and industries from the home. 
These have important educational values and the lack 
in the home must be supplied by the school. So far 
as the pupils are concerned this is easy, because they 
want it. Countless thousands of boys and girls leave 
school early because they tire of book lessons. These 
would remain in school and do all necessary academic 
work, if only they had a chance to do other things that 
seem to them more worth while. 
A Far-reaching Movement.—The significance of this 
movement cannot now be estimated. With a saner curric- 
ulum for the elementary school, more interesting and 
attractive to the pupils, it should be easy to keep nearly 
all children in school regularly until they complete the 
elementary course. Beyond the elementary school the 
work should gradually take on a distinctly vocational 
aim for the majority of students. Besides studying lit- 
erature and history for culture, the boys and girls should 
be learning to do with intelligence and skill the very 
things they will probably have to do all their lives. The 
work in science, for example, should relate directly to 
cooking, to agriculture, to typical manufacturing proc- 
esses. 
Above all, the secondary schools and colleges of the 
future will be adjusted to the needs of those boys and 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  214 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
girls who must-devote much of their time to helping 
with the work at home, to earning their own support, 
or helping to support others dependent upon them. 
Under some such plan as that of the European “Con- 
tinuation Schools” it would be easily possible for boys 
or girls over fourteen years of age to work their way 
through high school and college, getting a better training 
than most students now get in those schools; to learn 
thoroughly some trade, business vocation, or profession, 
concurrently with the school work; and to earn enough 
to support themselves during the time. In this view 
it is understood that the vocation of the girls is likely 
to be home-making. 
This plan, of course, will eliminate much of the 
alleged cultural material from the high school and col- 
lege courses these students take, but it will relate the 
work in science, mathematics, etc., much more intimately 
to the actual life interests of these students. Things will 
not be studied for the recitation, for the examination, 
or for the credits, but for their use in the practical 
affairs in which the student is engaged. 
Manual arts and industries in elementary schools, 
leading to vocational work in secondary schools, will 
identify school activities with other life interests. 
SOCIAL RESULTS 
The plans here outlined should tend to develop more 
intelligent, skillful and efficient workers in all lines. 
Workers are esteemed and ‘remunerated according to
-P-A-G-E-217
  
SUMMARIZING THE ANSWER 215 
their knowledge of their work and their- skill in execu- 
tion. Both these conditions will tend to raise the social 
status of the worker and to break down class distinc- 
tions. Better incomes for working people in both city 
and country will allow more time and money for litera- 
ture, music, and other forms of art, and this in turn 
will have its effect upon the social life of the people. 
Extensive training in manual arts and industries will 
tend to improve the social life of working people. 
CONCLUSION 
If the tentative conclusions reached in this study are 
in the main right, the meaning of manual arts and in- 
dustries in education is most significant and far-reaching. 
It means that we must thoroughly reorganize our school 
curricula, elementary, secondary, collegiate; that, instead 
of spending nearly all of their time sitting at desks, 
working over books, pupils will spend about half of 
their time in some kind of work room, or in gardens or 
fields ; that, after pupils have attained a certain maturity, 
the educational system will provide that they may work 
for pay half the time and pursue academic studies dur- 
ing the other half; that the vast majority will continue in 
school years longer than they do now; that among the 
masses of the people in industrial and commercial life 
there will be a constant rise in intelligence, in physical 
vigor, in economic efficiency, in prosperity, in moral 
stamina, in aesthetic interest, and in joy and satisfaction 
in life.

  CHAPTER XVII 
SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 
It does not seem possible to make a course of study, 
or courses of study, in manual arts and industries that 
would be equally valuable in different sections of the 
country, or even in different schools in the same locality. 
Certain lines of the work represented in the course should 
be related as intimately as possible to home and com- 
munity life with which the pupils come in contact. As 
these conditions vary in different sections of the country, 
and in different communities, so must the course of study 
vary if the work is to be most interesting and educative. 
But, there are certain interests and activities that are 
more or less common in all communities, These will 
constitute a basis for a general suggestive outline which 
may be filled in and supplemented as ‘necessary or desira- 
ble for local conditions. 
First, there are certain lines of early racial industrial 
activities that have historical as well as manual art values, 
and that appeal to the combined play and constructive 
impulses of children. In their proper time and place, 
and within common-sense limitations, these have educa- 
tional value for all children, and hence should find a place 
in the course of study. For example, the making of 
simple textiles and pottery were among the early efforts 
216
-P-A-G-E-219
SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 217 
of the man to utilize the materials of his environment. 
Rushes and coarse grasses were everywhere available 
for the simple mats, and clay could always be found for 
making the “coiled” bowls or pots. In either of these 
processes no tools were needed. They were genuine 
hand-made articles. 
To trace the discoveries and inventions in connection 
with the development of these and similar arts and 
industries, from their crude beginnings down to present 
day process, reveals important stages in the progress of 
the race in acquiring control of environment. Moreover, 
the evolution of any one of the industries carried along 
with it, to a greater or less extent, the evolution of the 
natural sciences, mathematics, and art. 
Manuat Trarninc 1n ELeMEntary ScHOooLs 
First Grade—The work of this grade should 
especially center largely about the activities of the child’s 
home life, should be mainly “play-work.” As much as 
possible, for some weeks or even months, various kinds 
of work should be correlated about some unifying in- 
terest. For example: 
1. Children make dolls’ playhouses out of dry-goods 
boxes, or a number unite in making and furnishing one 
house. 
(a) Furniture is made of light wood or paste- 
board, glue being used for joining. 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  218 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES i | 
(b) Simple rugs are woven from rushes, 
grasses or very coarse yarns. 
(c) Lessons in drawing and painting are ap- 
plied to making wall papers. 
(d) In some cases the pupils will be able to 
make their own curtains. 
2. If there is a period devoted to the study of a 
primitive people, for example, the North American In- 
dian, there’ should be a similar correlation, such as: 
(a) The representation of an Indian home, or 
better a small village, on the sand table. 
(b) Construction of wigwams. Z 
(c) Making canoes of bark, or cardboard. 
(d) Placing evergreen twigs to represent forest. 
(e) Modeling in clay the figures of Indian men, 
women, and children engaged in typical occupations. 
Modeling, also, some wild animals. 
(f) Making spears, tomahawks, bows and ar- 
rows, hunting knives of stone, a stone corn mill, etc. 
3. Representation of some typical industry, such as 
the production of bread. 
(a) Making primitive spades or a plow, and 
harrow. 
(b) A wooden reaping sickle, or a scythe. 
(c) A flail. 
(d) A sieve. 
(e) A mortar or stone mill. 
| ({) A baking stone. 
4. The approach of Christmas offers a strong incen- 
tive to construction work. The children may be allowed
-P-A-G-E-221
SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 219 
several weeks to select, design and make, with special 
care, articles to be given as Christmas presents. 
5. In the early work with wood there should be an 
introduction to (a) the study of trees; (b) the process 
of making lumber ; (c) the physical qualities of different 
woods. 
6. “The Story of Ab,” or “The Tree Dwellers” by 
Miss Dopp, might be made the basis of studies in primi- 
tive life, and the Indian life left for the second grade. 
Second Grade.—The general principles governing the 
work of this grade are the same as those for the first 
grade, the subject matter being determined by the life 
and environment of the children. 
1. The historical work should center about the life 
in the pastoral and early agriculture periods, somewhat 
as follows: 
(a) The story of how men came to domesticate 
animals. Why sheep and goats were among the first 
domesticated. 
(b) Examination of part or the whole of a 
fleece. 
(c) Experiments in primitive processes of wash- 
_ ing, combing, dyeing, and spinning wool. 
(d) Designing and weaving a blanket for a 
doll’s bed. 
(e) Children construct their own simple wooden 
hand looms. 
2. Social projects.—Children of this grade may make,
-P-A-G-E-222
220 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
of wood, some things for use in the school room or in 
the school garden, and the possibilities of Christmas gifts 
are enlarged by the increased skill of the children. Raffa 
table mats, simply embroidered burlap mats, pin trays 
modeled in clay and finished with a simple glaze, are 
suitable projects. 
3. Playthings——Because play still makes up so large 
a part of the life of the child the impulse to construct 
should be directly connected with the play impulse. Both 
boys and girls should be encouraged to make kites, tops, 
whistles, marbles, boats, bows and arrows, bird houses, 
etc. In addition the girls should dress dolls and model 
dishes of clay for the doll’s house. 
Third Grade.—If third grade children have access 
to a wood-working shop, they may begin to make system- 
atic use of such tools as the saw, hammer, plane, rule, 
try-square, brace and bit, gouge and mallet, spoke-shave, 
and wood file. On the historical side, projects may 
center about the beginning of commerce and transporta- 
tion. 
1. The pupils convert a large box into a store, put 
in a counter and a few shelves and samples of staple 
goods, or boxes labeled to represent the goods. They 
construct balances to weigh articles, and rules with which 
to measure. 
2. In connection with the study of transportation 
they make boats, sleds, carts, wagons, freight cars, tracks, 
bridges, etc.
-P-A-G-E-223
SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 2215% 
3. For the home or school.—Pen-racks, trays, paper 
knives, desk-boxes, paper-files, portfolios, etc. 
4. Playthings—Houses for pets, wind mills, water- 
_ wheels, cross-bows, base balls and bats, balloons, etc. 
5. Other lines of work.—Basketry, pottery, and tex- 
tiles within the power of the children. 
Fourth Grade.—Historically, the fourth grade work 
will commonly run into the colonial period, and _ this 
should form the basis of some of the handwork. 
1. One group of children make a settler’s log cabin. 
It should be, in miniature, a real log cabin, with fireplace, 
loft, chinks filled with clay, etc. 
If the class is large a second group may build a 
blockhouse, enclosed by a stockade. 
Some furniture of colonial types may also be made. 
The problem of clothing is a good one to work over 
at this time. Spinning wool, cotton, or flax; weaving’ on 
hand or foot power loom; knitting; netting; sewing. 
Other industries—Making sugar, candles, soap, etc. 
2. Projects of immediate present day interest: Play- 
things, things of use in the home or the school; e. g., a 
hen coop, a house for a pet, a hammock, a raffia basket or 
hat, a bow and arrow, a sail boat, a key rack, a cross- - 
bow, a fern stand, a window box, a letter opener, a coat 
hanger. 
Fifth Grade—The work from the fifth grade on 
will depend largely upon what previous training the chil-  
-P-A-G-E-224
ee ee 
222 | MANUAL ARTS AND ee 
dren have had. If they have had but little training selec- 
tions should be made from some of the more typical 
forms suggested for earlier grades. Otherwise they 
should go on to projects requiring more technical skill, 
but following the same general principles, that the work 
be intimately related to the lives of the children in the 
home or in the school. 
1. Woodwork may include such articles as a bread- 
board, a box kite, a nail box, a bracket shelf, a milking 
stool, etc. Simple working drawings should be made. | 
2. In pottery such articles as fern-dishes, simple | 
vases, candlesticks, and trays are suitable for this grade. 
At this stage the pupils may decorate their pottery with 
simple cutting and coloring. Articles should be glazed 
and fired from this time on. 
3. Sewing should occupy the girls while the boys 
are in the shop. As in other work, the pupils should, 
with guidance, decide what they wish to make, plan the 
work, select the material, and generally possess what they 
produce. 
Sixth Grade.—The same general principles should 
prevail as in the fifth grade work. 
1. Woodwork.—Sun dial, weather vane, waste 
basket, teapot-stand, picture frame, any simple piece of 
furniture. 
3. Sewing.—Aprons, dust caps, bags, sofa-pillow 
2. Leather work.—Pen wipers, card case, book cover. 
covers, simple garments. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 223 
4. Metal work,—candle shade, hall lamps, pin tray, 
pencil tray, bowl. Materials and tools: thin sheet copper 
or brass, band iron, binders; hammers, mallet, blocks, 
files, pliers, snips, small iron vise. / 
5. Mechanical drawing should be taught so far as 
needed in plans. 
Seventh Grade.—The work of the seventh grade 
should aim especially at increased technical skill. If work 
corresponding with that previously suggested has been 
done, the seventh grade may undertake something like 
the following: 
1. Woodwork,—a mission chair, table or desk. This 
should involve accurate working drawings and a study of 
different methods of wood-finishing as well as skillful 
construction. 
2. Inthe rural school the woodwork may relate more 
specifically to farm needs; e. g., a double tree, a farm 
gate, making a brace or a rafter, a wagon box. 
3. The work of the girls should at this stage become 
distinctly specialized in domestic arts and sciences. See 
other courses following. 5d 
Eighth Grade.—In this grade boys should make one 
good piece of furniture, study and test other methods 
of staining and finishing wood. Wood-carving may also 
be begun. 
Boys in the country should have some forge work, 
learning to mend a chain, sharpen a plow iron, cut a

  224 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
| 
thread on a bolt, etc., to the end that they may be able to 
make ordinary repairs on farm implements. 
Girls should make a special study of house sanitation 
and decoration. See other courses. 
Domestic SciENcCE IN ELEMENTARY ScHOOLS* 
Fifth Grade.—Study of home industries, com- 
paring colonial times with the present.

varied aspects: conditions of a good site; what con- 
stitutes a good basement; plans for first and second 
floors, with special consideration of kitchen, pantry, 
‘and dining room management; study of warming, 
lighting, plumbing, and ventilating; how to keep 
the house clean; the relation of dirt to disease. 
House furnishing and decoration. Appropriate- 
ness in color schemes as applied to furniture, rugs, 
and wall decoration.   
THE ScHooL GARDEN oR Farm 
Purpose.—The school garden or farm has many ele- 
ments of educational value. It affords opportunity for 
the expression of the child’s impulses to play with soil, 
to plant things and see them grow, to produce something 
distinctly his own. In so far as soil and plants are con- 
cerned, it provides the best conditions for nature study. 
It tends to develop the true workmanship attitude and 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
    226 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
habit, because the real end of the activities is necessarily 
remote. The experiences not only give valuable first- 
hand knowledge covering a wide range of subjects, basal 
to all the sciences, but they open to view the marvellous 
possibilities of intelligent work in the various phases of 
agriculture. 
Size.—The size of the garden or farm depends upon 
local conditions. For a city school, or a small country 
school, a plot containing from 100 to 500 square yards 
is valuable. The more the better, providing it is well 
utilized. A large rural school should have from one to 
three acres, and a consolidated rural school or an agri- 
cultural high school can well use from*five to ten acres. 
Divisions.—Whether large or small the garden should 
be subdivided so that each pupil has an individual plot. 
When space permits there should also be some plots for 
group work along certain experimental lines, such as 
seed improvement, plant propagation, fruit growing, fer- 
tilization, etc. 
Fertilizing —Except in rare special cases no attempt 
should be made to raise a crop without the application 
of fertilizing material. This should be discussed with the 
pupils and the kind and amount of fertilizer decided 
upon. As the work proceeds experiments may easily 
be conducted to show value of fertilizing and what kinds 
of special: fertilizers are best for particular soils. The 
main point, however, is that when crops are taken from
-P-A-G-E-229
- 
SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 227 
the soil, that soil becomes poor unless materials for plant- 
foods are returned to it in a form that the plants can 
take up. 
Spading or Plowing.—As much as possible of the 
work should be done by the pupils. A number of large 
boys can spade a large plot in a few hours, and there is 
no reason why they should miss such excellent physical 
culture. The large boys should do this work for the 
smaller pupils. When, however, the plot is large, it 
should be plowed, the pupils witnessing the process and 
some, if possible, taking part. The value of deep culture 
should be studied in connection with plowing, fertilizing, 
and length of plant roots. 
Planting, Weeding, and Cultivating —Planting in- 
volves a study of depth, spacing, including ultimate thin- 
ning or transplanting. Pupils should early learn that one 
good strong plant, well nourished, is better than two 
weak, half-starved ones. 
Weeds are highway robbers to the cultivated plants. 
They are usually stronger and more vigorous than the 
desired plant. To “grow like a weed” is proverbial. 
Hence they get most of the plant food where they have 
a chance. The children should learn that it is easier to 
destroy a little weed than a big one. For every reason, 
therefore, the ideal of a “weedless plot” should be held 
before the pupils. 
Many confuse cultivation with the destruction of 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  228 MANUAL ARTS AND INDUSTRIES 
weeds, because cultivation does destroy weeds. Its real 
purpose, however, is to open and stir the soil, to let the 
air and warmth in and unfavorable gases out. The only 
precaution necessary is that the cultivation does not in- 
terfere with the spreading roots of the plants. 
Watering and Vacation Care.—In most localities, in 
the early season, it will be beneficial to the young plants 
to have more water than is supplied by the ordinary rain- 
fall. Pupils should be taught how and when to supply 
this need. Another problem is that of caring for the 
garden during vacation. This problem should be under- 
stood from the outset and, if possible, pupils should be 
held responsible for their individual plots. Where each 
plot is small a half-hour once a week will be sufficient to 
keep it in good condition. If some pupils are to be away 
during vacation, they may arrange with others to care 
for their plots. As a last resort, the janitor or some one 
else may be hired to do it. A neglected garden is de- 
moralizing. : 
The Crop.—It is expected that the garden will pro- 
duce things that are worth while, hence it follows that 
the products should be used. If some pupils in a particu- 
lar year grow only flowers, the flowers should be cut and 
used to decorate the school room, taken home, or sent to a 
hospital or other worthy place where they will be valued, 
or, if the grower wishes to sell them, he should be free 
to do so. Vegetables and fruits should be gathered at
-P-A-G-E-231
SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSES OF STUDY 229 
the proper time and used or disposed of as in the case of 
the flowers. It is sometimes a good plan to have pupils 
estimate the value of their product. In a very real sense, 
neglecting all other conditions, the pupil who produces 
the most value on his plot is the most successful farmer. 
Special Problems.—In so far as possible, each pupil 
should have some special problem to work out, beside 
merely trying to get something to grow. Some may 
divide their plots into two or three equal parts and test 
fertilizers. Some may cross-fertilize two varieties of 
corn or other plants and develop a new variety. To 
merely select the best seed each year for three or four 
years and watch results is sufficiently interesting. A 
small plot may be utilized as a nursery where different 
methods of plant propagation may be tested. Older pu- 
pils may make and experiment with a hot-bed.

The aim of the work in the Domestic Science and the 
Domestic Art Departments bears a distinct relation to 
the aim of manual training work in general. The aim is 
distinctly character building, and the careful guiding of 
the girl to happiness through the ability to do and ex- 
press herself through home mediums. It aims to lead her 
to become a responsible being, ready to take the initiative 
when she faces the world and its requirements. The 
sewing, dressmaking, cooking, etc., presented are in no 
sense the end and aim; they are simply the means of 
attaining educational training. Because of the practical 
nature of the work, the girl is enabled to take up the 
duties of life in a more competent and intelligent way, 
and to become a home-maker in the broadest sense of 
  School, Muskegon, Michigan.

toward an “all-around” development that can be obtained 
in a large measure through the training of the motor ac- 
tivities along lines most closely related to home-making. 
Domestic Art 
First Year.—The aim of the course in Domestic 
Art during the first year is to make the girl more self- 
reliant and responsible, and to lead her to self-expression 
in all her work; the emphasis is placed on the educational 
training, not on the garment produced. The growing in- 
terests of the girl are considered. 
Subjects considered: 
,1. Machine sewing, history of machines, com- 
parison, use, care; practice stitching, tucking, use of 
gauge, tucker, etc.; drafting and making a pillow 
case and one undergarment.

the skirt. The month preceding Christmas is de- 
voted to making simple gifts, suggested by the pupils 
and the teacher. During the past year, such articles 
as the following were made: 
Turn-over collars, cuffs, handkerchiefs, bed room 
slippers, baby sacques, aprons, hand-hags, center-

touch and a skill in handling, which such materials de- 
mand. The course trains the imagination and aims to 
cultivate a love and appreciation for the beautiful and ar- 
tistic. The work of this year should form the basis of 
the study of home decoration, and will correlate with the 
courses in Domestic Science, House Sanitation, etc. (See 
fourth year course Domestic Science.) It is the aim to 
suggest to the girls the true beauty and atmosphere of a

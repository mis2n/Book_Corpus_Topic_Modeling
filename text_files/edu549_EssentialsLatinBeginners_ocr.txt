  PREEACKE 
Tus book is designed primarily to prepare pupils in a thorough 
fashion to read Caesar’s Gadic War. It contains seventy lessons, 
including ten that are devoted exclusively to reading, and six supple- 
mentary lessons. ‘The first seventy lessons contain the minimum’ 
of what a pupil should know before he is ready to read Latin with 
any degree of intelligence and satisfaction. The supplementary 
lessons deal largely with certain principles of syntax that some 
teachers may not wish to present to their pupils during the first 
year’s work. They are independent of one another and of the rest 
of the book, and may, therefore, be taken up in any order that the 
teacher wishes, or any number of them may be omitted. 
It is hoped that the following features will commend themselves 
to teachers of first year Latin: 
1. Carefully selected vocabularies, containing with a very few 
exceptions only those words that occur with the greatest frequency 
in Caesar’s Gallic War. About five hundred words are presented 
in the first seventy lessons. 
2. The constant comparison of English and Latin usage. Not 
much knowledge of English grammar on the part of the pupil is 
taken for granted. The more difficult constructions are first 
considered from the English point of view. 
3. A more logical and consecutive treatment of topics. Nouns, 
adjectives, pronouns, and verbs are not treated in a piecemeal 
fashion, but four or five consecutive lessons are devoted to a topic 
before passing on to another. Sufficient change, however, is in- 
troduced to avoid monotony.

4 PREFACE 
4. A brief preparatory course. Allowing ample time for re- 
views, the first seventy lessons should be thoroughly mastered in 
about twenty-five weeks. 
5. The Review Exercises under each lesson. These employ 
the vocabulary and constructions of the preceding lessons, and 
afford additional practice for those who wish it. They may be 
omitted, however, if desired, as the regular Exercises also review 
preceding constructions. 
6. Carefully graded material for reading. ‘There are stories for 
rapid reading, based on the vocabulary and constructions already 
studied, and selections from Viri Romae and the first twenty 
chapters of Caesar’s Gallic War, Book II, in simplified form. 
This material should prepare a pupil to begin to read the regular 
text of Caesar at the beginning of the second year. 
I wish to express my grateful acknowledgments to the following 
well-known teachers of Latin who have read the manuscript of 
this book, and have rendered valuable assistance by their sug- 
gestions and criticisms: Mr. H. F. Towle, Curtis High School, New 
York City ; Mr. A. L. Hodges, Wadleigh High School, New York 
City ; Mr. A. J. Inglis, Horace Mann High School, New York City ; 
Mr. Herbert T. Rich, Boston Latin School. This book has had 
the benefit of the criticism of Professor M. H. Morgan of Harvard 
University, one of the editors of the series, who has carefully read 
both the manuscript and the proof.

PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION 
THE present revision embodies some of the suggestions received 
from time to time from teachers who have used the Essentials. 
It has been undertaken, not to change the character or plan of the 
work, but solely to introduce such simplifications and amplifications 
as will make it still more helpful to the beginner. The statement 
of rules has ina number of instances been modified ; a different
-P-A-G-E-5
  PREFACE 5 
arrangement has been given to the conjugations in the appendix ; 
the introduction has been made somewhat fuller ; and the order of 
Lessons 38 and 39 has been changed. In other respects the changes 
are internal and do not affect the method or scope of the work. 
Many full-page illustrations have been added, together with 
several new cuts of smaller size and a double-page map of the 
western portion of the Roman empire at the time of Caesar. 
All the changes made in this edition have been scrutinized and 
approved by Professor Charles Knapp of Columbia University, 
to whose keen scholarship and valuable aid the author is deeply 
indebted.

INTRODUCTION 
1.~These introductory sections should be read by the 
pupils and used for reference. Pupils learn pronunciation 
quickly by imitation. It is suggested that the teacher 
pronounce slowly the words in sections 9 and 21, and that 
the pupils repeat them after the teacher. Reference may 
be made to the rules as mistakes are made. 
ALPHABET 
2. The Latin alphabet is the same as the English, 
except that it has no 7 or w. J is used both as a vowel 
and as a consonant. It is a consonant when it stands 
before a vowel in the same syllable, as in itnior. 
3. The vowels are a, e, i, 0, u. The other letters are 
consonants. ‘ 
4. Diphthongs are combinations of two vowels that are 
pronounced as one syllable. They are 
ae oe au eu ui 
PRONUNCIATION 
5. The long vowels are pronounced as follows: 
a like a in father. i like z in machine. 
é like e¢ in prey. 6 like o in note. 
i like 00 in root. 
6. The short vowels are pronounced as follows: | 
a like the first a in ahd. . i like 7 in pz. 
e like e¢ in step. o like o in ov 
u like # in pad. 
Il
-P-A-G-E-12
I2 ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 
7. Most of the consonants are pronounced as in English. 
But note the following points: 
c and g are always hard, as__s isa hissing sound, as in s¢z; 
in come and go. never like z as in case. 
i consonant is like yin yes. ch is like ch in chorus. 
t is always hard, as in dn. ph is like pf in alphabet. 
  vis like win wine. a is almost like Aw. 
8. The diphthongs are pronounced as follows: 
ae like az in azs/e. au like ow in house. 
oe like o@ in ¢ozd. eu (rare) like ¢h-oo. 
ui is almost like we. ei (rare) like e7 in eight. 
9. Pronounce carefully the following words: 
hi iam tot mé eye a 
ad vis sic uia coepit 
ita quis haec caySa  régnd méysae 
YLLABLES 
to. A syllable consists of a vowel or diphthong alone 
or with one or more consonants, préceding or following. 
Therefore a word has as many syllables as it has separate 
vowels or diphthongs: ae-di-fi-cé, 7 dudld. 
11. Except in compound words (see 13), a single con- 
sonant between vowels or diphthongs should be joined with 
the second vowel: a-mi-cus, friend, di-xit, he said. 
Taio TE ee ee ae or 
diphthongs, the division is before the last consonant, extept 
that 1 or r with the consonant immediately preceding is 
joined to the second vowel: hés-pes, guest, dic-tus, said, 
sdnc-tus, oly, cas-tra, camp, dé-méns-tro, J point out, cdg- 
nés-cd, J recognize, pt-bli-cus, pudlic. : 
13. Compound words are divided into their component 
parts: ad-est (ad, wear; est, he is), he ts present.

14. RRR ERS a rer pu-él-la, g77/. 
15. The last syllable of a word is called the w/tima, the 
next to the last, the penu/t, the one before the penult, the 
© 
antepenult. « 
QuanTITY \\s 
16. Vowels are long (-) or short (v). The long vowels / 
are marked in this book; unmarked vowels must be con- —— 
sidered short. Diphthongs are long. 
«17. The following are a few general rules for determin- { 
ing the quantity of vowels: 
1. A vowel is short before another vowel or h: co-pi-a, 
abundance. 
2. Vowels resulting from contraction are long: cé-gd 
(cdago), J collect. 
3. Vowels are long before ni a L bring 
in; 9h us, mad. 
_ 4. Dipht ah are long: caysa, cause. 
18. A syllable containing a long vowel or a diphthong is | 
long by nature: lé-gés, /aws,; ae-dés, temple. 
19 Avsyllable containing a short vowel followed by two 
or more consonants, or by x or z, is long by. position, The 
shovt vowel, however, is still pronounced—short : vefant, 
. they call; dux, leader. ‘ 
ACCENT 
2». The following principles determine what” syllable 
of a word receives the stress of the voice (accent): 
1. The ultima, or last syllable, is never accen 
2. Words, of two syllables accent the first, or penult: es 
témplum, ¢emple.
-P-A-G-E-14
14 ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 
Bi oat oe accent the penult 
by nature or position, otherwise the 
siete amare, zo Jove; mit e, fo send. 
4. Certain words like -ne, the sign of @ question, and -que, 
and, called_enclitics, are so closely joined to the pre- 
ceding word that they are pr ith if; the 
last syllable of th word has an accent: ashe, 
docs he love? hényinésque, and the men. v 
     
  EXERCISE 
21. Divide into syllables, accent, and pronounce the 
foljowing words: 
fu LA i ptf vingam aedificium gladio 
giauae ‘ifs coepérunt cuifis 
huic idem filiusque quae 
monére vero ménsarum faciébam 
facere aegrittidd pugnabo laudabimus 
INFLECTION 
22. Parts of Speech.— These are the same in Latin 
as in English, except that there is no article in—Latin: 
namely, noun, adjective, pronoun, verb, adverb, and the 
particles. 
23. Inflection. — This is the change that words undergo 
to show their grammatical relations to the rest of the sen- 
tence. The inflection of nouns, adjectives; and pronouns 
is called declension ; that of verbs, conjugation. 
' 24. Declension. — Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives have 
the following cases, which are shown by means of case 
endings : 
1. Nominative, which is the case of the subject. 
2. Genitive. It may generally be rendered by the English 
possessive, or by the objective with of - SAS OF DY, ENE ODI SSNS ALAA E;
-P-A-G-E-15
  
Leia rt JY Perna, { ESSENTIALS OF LATIN rs 
3. Dative. This corresponds sometimes to the English 
objective with the prepositions ¢o or for. aes 
4. Accusative, the case of the direct object. 
Vocative, the case of.direct address.1 
Ablative. This expresses various adverbial relations 
corresponding to the English objective with the prep- 
ositions from, with, in, by, at, and on. 
Nouns in Latin are divided into five declensions, or 
classes, which are best distinguished from one another by 
the ending of the genitive singular. ~~. Oe 
25. Stem and Base. — The stem is the form which gives 
in a general way the meaning of the word. The final letter 
of the stem. isti often disappears | 
or is changed before case endings. It is always found in 
itive plural,-except that o of -o-stems is lengthened. 
The base (that part of the noun which remains unchanged 
in inflection, and to which the case endings are added 
directly) is formed by dropping the st racteristic or 
by omitting the ending of the genitive singular. 
26. Conjugation. — Verbs in Latin have 
1. Three finite moods, Indicative, Subjunctive, Impera- 
tive; also Infinitives, Participles, Supines, Gerunds,, 
and Gerundives. 
2. Six tenses, Present, Imperfect, Future, Perfect, Plu- 
perfect, Future Perfect. 
3. Two voices, as in English, Active and Passive. 
4. Three persons, as in English, First, Second, Third. - 
5. Two numbers, as in English, Singular and Plural. /~ 
1 Except in the singular of nouns in -us of the second dgelenaios oie voca- 
tive case is like the nominative. It is therefore not given in the paradigms 
except in the second declension.

GENDER 
27. There are three genders, Masculine, Feminine, and 
Neuter. 
In names of persons only, the gender is based, as in Eng- 
lish, on sex (Natural Gender). In all other classes of words 
the gender is determined by the signification of the noun or 
_by the ending of the nominative (Grammatical Gender). 
28., General Rules of Gender. 
1. Nouns denoting mal 
‘and months are masculine: 
i hb, Jantary. 
2) noting females, and names of countri wns, 
and trees .re feminine: filia, angler alia, aly 
Rie, den ; pirus, pear tree. 
3. Indeclinable nouns are neuter: nihil, xothing.

Observe in these sentences 
1. That agricola denotes the same person as Marcus, and 
that it tells something about him, and is in the same

has the same relation to Marcd. Compare with 33, c, 
and note the difference.

declined like nouns of those declensions. As has been 
seen in 51 and 56, the endings of the masculine and neuter 
of adjectives are the same as the endings of the nouns of 
the second declension, and the feminine endings are the 
same as those of nouns of the first declension (32). The 
complete declension of bonus, good, is as follows:

dans, the nominative singular of the present participle.

IMPERFECT AND FUTURE OF sum. REVIEW 
81. Review 39. The imperfect and future tenses of 
sum are conjugated as follows: 
IMPERFECT - Future 
" SINGULAR 
I. eram, / was 1. erd, J shall be 
2. eras, you were 2. eris, you will be 
3. erat, he was, there was 3. erit, he will be, there will be

I. eramus, we were I. erimus, we shall be 
2. eratis, you were 2. eritis, you will be 
3. erant, they were, there 3. erunt, they will be, there

1. Are the personal endings of these tenses regular? 
See 43. Are these endings the same as those of 
the present of sum? 
82. Order of Words. — In an English sentence the order 
of the words is very important, because of the compara- 
tively few inflectional endings. A change in the order 
1 Be careful as to the position of this word. See page 27, footnote 1.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 41 
may change entirely the meaning of a sentence. For 
example: : 
Caesar praises the loyal farmers. 
The loyal farmers praise Caesar. 
In Latin, a change in the order of the words does not 
usually change the meaning of the sentence, but merely 
shows the emphasis which the writer wishes to give to a 
particular word or phrase. For example: 
1. Caesar agricolas fidds laudat, Caesar praises the loyal 
Sarmers. 
2. Caesar fidds agricolas laudat, Caesar praises the loyal 
Sarmers. 
3. Agricolas fidds laudat Caesar, Caesar praises the loyal 
farmers. 
The first sentence shows the normal! order, and implies 
no special emphasis on any word, but this order is often 
changed to express the emphasis the writer wishes to show. 
In the second sentence fidds is more emphatic than in the 
first. In the third agricolas fidds and Caesar are emphatic.

REvIEW List OF NouNS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND DECLENSIONS 
1. Review carefully the meaning, gender, and declension 
of each noun. 
2. Recall any English equivalents that the Latin words 
suggest, viz., vita, val; nauta, xautical. Also 
watch for relationship between Latin words, viz., 
ager, field; agricola, farmer. Do this for new words 
of succeeding vocabularies. ee 
1 The normal order of a Latin sentence is (1) subject with modifiers, 
(2) indirect object with modifiers, (3) direct object with modifiers, (4) adverb, 
(5) verb. But this normal order very often gives way to considerations of 
emphasis or clearness.

fect with those of the imperfect (87). There is this 
difference in the use of the two tenses: the perfect

134. Jurius CAESAR 
Julius Caesar is the greatest character in Roman history. 
He was great, not merely as a general, but also as an 
orator and statesman. He was born on the 12th of July, 
100 B.c. He belonged to an old, aristocratic family, but 
at an early age allied himself with the party of the people. 
After filling many minor political offices, at the age of 
forty-one he became consul, and formed a political alliance 
_ with Pompey and Crassus, known as the “ First Triumvi- 
rate.” The next year the government of Gaul was assigned 
to him, and it is the subjugation of this country that he 
describes in his Commentaries. These Gallic Commen- 
taries have been read in schools for hundreds of years, 
and they establish conclusively his ability as a writer. 
After spending eight years in Gaul, he was ordered by 
the Senate through the jealousy of Pompey to disband his 
army. Caesar refused, and, crossing the Rubicon, set out 
with his army to make himself the master of Rome. In 
the civil war that followed, Pompey at the head of the sena- 
torial forces was defeated. This left Caesar the master of 
the government at Rome. As Dictator and Imperator for 
life he instituted many reforms that show his insight as

disliked Caesar’s power. A conspiracy was formed, and 
Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 B.C.

135. Tue HELVETIAN WAR 
The Helvetii were people of Celtic origin who inhabited 
almost all that region now known as Switzerland. 
In the year 58 B.c., incited by ambitious leaders, they 
decided to leave their homes and seize the more fertile 
lands to the southwest, lying nearer the Roman province 
in Gaul. It is to this uprising of the Helvetii that Caesar 
devotes the first thirty chapters of his first book of Gallic 
Commentaries. After two battles the Helvetii, being com- 
pletely subdued by Caesar, were forced to return to their 
former territories. 
The reading lessons that follow are adapted from the 
first ten chapters of Caesar’s account of this Helvetian 
war.

NOMS The present infinitive active of all verbs has appeared 
as the second principal part of each verb given (86). 
Observe that the present passive is formed from the 
present active by changing final -e to -i, except in 
the third conjugation, which changes final -ere to -i. 
183. Examine the following: 
Matirat milités convocare, Ze hastens to summon the | 
soldiers. 
Laudari est gratum, Zo de praised is pleasant. 
Incolas armari iubet, he orders the inhabitants to be 
armed. 
Omnés primi esse cupimus, we a// wish to be first. 
Débet interfici, Le ought to be killed. 
Fortis esse dicitur, /e zs sazd to be brave. 
Filids bonds esse cupimus, zwe wish our sons to be good. 
These examples show that the infinitive in Latin is 
often used as it is in English. 
In 2, the infinitive is subject of est. In 1, 4, 5, 6, the 
infinitive completes the meaning of the main verb, 
and 8“eal&l the complementary infinitive.
-P-A-G-E-105
  
ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 93 
c. In 3, observe that incolas, the subject of the infinitive, is 
accusative. So filids in 7. In 4, note that the predi- 
cate adjective primi agrees with the subject of the 
main verb, cupimus, and is therefore nominative. In 
7, the predicate adjective agrees with the subject of 
the infinitive and is therefore accusative. 
184. RULES OF SYNTAX 
1. Subject of Infinitive. — Tie subject of the infinitive is 
in the accusative. 
2. Complementary Infinitive.— Verbs signifying to be 
willing, determine, be able, dare, begin, cease, be accustomed, 
etc., are used with an infinitive (complementary infinitive) 
without subject accusative, to indicate another action of the 
subject of the verb of willing, determining, etc. 
3. Predicate Adjective with Infinitive.— A predicate ad- 
jective with a complementary infinitive agrees with the 
subject of the main verb.

a. The relative pronoun refers to some word, and the word 
to which it refers is called its antecedent; thus the 
antecedent of quas in 1 is féminae. Point out the 
antecedents in the other sentences. 
6. Observe that the relative has the same gender and num- 
ber as its antecedent, but that z¢s case is not necessarily 
the same. The case of the relative is determined by 
its relation to the words of its own clause: for ex- 
ample, in 1, quas is accusative because it is the direct 
object of vidémus; in 5, quo is ablative to express the 
instrument of the verb vulneratus sum. Explain the 
cases of the other relatives. 
c. In 6, is does not refer to any particular person, but 
means a@ man, one. Is is thus commonly used as 
the antecedent of the relative. This is, in fact, the 
commonest use of is. : 
197. RuLE.— Agreement of Relative Pronoun. — A re/- 
ative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and 
number, but its case depends upon the construction of the 
clause in which it stands, not upon the case of its antecedent.

PERSONAL AND REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS 
284. Learn the forms of the personal and reflexive pro- 
nouns with their meanings (511): ego, /, ti, you; sui, of 
himself, herself, itself. 
285. UsE OF THE PERSONAL PRONOUNS 
1. The pronoun of the first person is ego, 7; of the second 
person ti, you, of the third person is, ea, id, 4e, she, 
zt (190, @). _They are used m Latin as subjects only 
to show emphasis or to avoid ambiguity. 
a. Té voces, /’m calling you. (“I” is unemphatic, and 
therefore ego is not used.) 
4, Ego té vocd, /(emphatic) am calling you. (Such emphasis 
1 Why is there no preposition? See 237, 3.  ? Le. the river Rhone.
-P-A-G-E-156
138 ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 
might be expressed in English by the translation, 
“It is I who am calling you.”’) 
c. Egoeum laudo; is méculpat, / praise him; he blames me. 
It will be recalled that in the exercises of the preceding 
lessons the subjects of the verbs, when pronouns, were 
not expressed. Why is it impossible to omit the personal 
pronouns as subjects in English as often as in Latin? 
286. UsE OF THE REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS 
1. A reflexive pronoun is one that refers back to the sub- 
ject of the clause or sentence in which it stands (see 
also 428). It is never in the nominative case and 
so is never subject. 
S. 1. I praise myself Pi. We praise ourselves 
2. You praise yourself You praise yourselves 
oe praises | 
31 She praises herself 
2. In Latin the pronouns of the first and second person, 
ego and ti (except in the nominative case), are used 
both as personal and reflexive pronouns. There is 
no special form for the reflexive as in English. In 
the third person, however, there is a special form for 
the reflexive, sui, of himself, herself, itself. 
S. 1. mé laudd, / praise PL. nods laudamus, we praise They praise themselves 
myself ourselves 
2. té laudas, you praise vos laudatis, you praise 
yourself yourselves 
3. sé laudat, he praises sé laudant, they praise 
himself themselves | 
3. Review 190. Do not confuse is with sui. Sui regularly 
refers to the subject of the sentence or clause in which 
it stands.

a. Vir sé videt, the man sees himself. 
6, Vir eum videt, the man sees him (some one else). 
4. Review 207, 2. Do not confuse ipse with sé. Ipse is 
not a reflexive, but merely emphasizes the noun to 
which it belongs. It may be used in any case. 
a. Vir ipse eum vidit, the man himself saw him. 
am Vir sé vidit, the man saw himself. 
Virum ipsum vidimus, we saw the man himself. 
287. The preposition cum does not precede the ablative of 
personal and reflexive pronouns, but is appended to them: 
técum, instead of cum té; ndbiscum, instead of cum nobis. 
So also quibuscum, w7ti whom, instead of cum quibus. 
288. Examine the following: 
1. Ego, qui haec facid, tuus pater sum, /, who do this, am 
your father. 
2. Vos, qui haec facitis, mei amici estis, you, who do this, 
are my friends.

to the subject, use the genitive of is, eius, A7s, her, tts ; 
edrum, ‘Hezr ; earum, ¢hezr (referring to feminine). 
a. Agricola suum equum laudat, the farmer praises his (i.e. 
his own) forse.

INDEFINITE PRONOUNS. DESCRIPTIVE ABLATIVE AND 
GENITIVE 
300. Review 195, 216. Indefinite pronouns are used to 
indicate that some person or thing is referred to, without 
indicating just what one. They vary in degree of indefi- 
niteness. Learn the declension of the following indefinite 
pronouns, carefully distinguishing the meanings (see 515): 
INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER 
quis qua quid (quod), somebody, anybody 
aliquis aliqua aliquid (aliquod), some one 
quisquam quicquam, any one (at all) (no plur.) 
quidam quaedam quoddam, quiddam, @ certain one 
quisque quaeque quidque, quodque, cach one, every one 
1. The meanings of the neuter would be something, etc. 
2. Quisquam and quisque are declined like quis. 
3. In the neuter the quid-forms are used as pronouns, the 
quod-forms as adjectives. 
301. USES OF THE INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 
I. Quis, some one, any one, is never the first word in its clause. 
It is generally used only after si, nisi, né, num: si 
quid his accidit, 7f anything happens to them. 
1 Express by the neuter plural of the proper possessive adjective.  
-P-A-G-E-165
ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 145 
2. Quisque, cach, should be distinguished from omnis, a//, 
every. It is not often used in the plural, and regu- 
larly follows the word to which it belongs. 
3. Quisquam is used chiefly in negative and conditional sen- 
tences: nec quisquam hoc facit, and nobody does this. 
4. Aliquis, some one or other, some one, denotes some one 
whose identity is unknown: aliquis tibi haec dixit, 
some one (I do not know who) told you this. 
5. Quidam denotes some one whose identity is known but 
is not fully revealed: quidam haec mihi dixit, some 
one (I know who, but I will not tell) told me this. 
302. Examine the following: 
1. Vir summae virtitis fuit, } he was a man of very great 
2. Vir summa virtite fuit, courage. 
Observe that the genitive phrase summae virtitis and 
! the ablative phrase summa virtite describe the noun vir; 
and that an adjective modifies the nouns virtitis and virtite. 
303. RuLE.— Descriptive Genitive and Ablative. — 7he 
ablative or the genitive of a noun, if itself modified by an 
adjective or genitive, may be used to describe a person or 
object. The genitive is less common in this use than the 
ablative, it occurs chiefly in expressions of measure or num- 
ber, and in phrases consisting of nouns modified by magnus, 
maximus, summus, tantus.

  1. Learn the participles, with their meanings, of the. model 
verbs (516-520). 
2.; Participles ending in -ns are declined like adjectives 
of the third declension (504); those in -us, like bonus 
(62). 
308. The participle is a verbal adjective. As a verb, it 
may govern a case; as an adjective, it agrees with a sub- 
stantive. The tenses of the participle denote time, zot 
absolutely, as in the indicative mood, but with reference to 
the time of the verb of the clause in which it stands. The 
following examples will show how the time of the participle 
depends upon that of the main verb. 
110 verbs have a connecting vowel e before the ending; ¢.e. audiéns, audi-~

311. Participles are used in Latin more extensively than 
in English. In Latin the participle is used to express 
ideas that are often expressed in English by a relative 
clause, by clauses beginning with “ when,” “ after,” “ since,” 
“although,” “while,” “if,” etc. Study carefully the fol- 
lowing examples, which show the various relations that the 
participle expresses : 
I. Milités missds non culpavit, Ze did not blame the soldiers 
who had been sent (lit., the soldiers sent). This use is 
not common; a relative clause is generally used. 
2. Vidébam eds id agentés, / saw them as (or when) they 
were doing this. 
3. Caesar consul factus in Galliam contendit, Caesar, after 
he had been made consul, hastened into Gaul (literally,

THE PARTICIPLE (Continvep). ABLATIVE ABSOLUTE 
315. Ablative Absolute.— A noun or a pronoun in the 
ablative, with a participle agreeing with it, may be used to 
express any of the ideas mentioned in 311. This con- 
struction will be understood best by a careful study of the 
following examples : 
1. Caesar, Germanis 
victis, in hi- 
berna vénit, 
2. Oppidé expugnato, | 
hostés vincent, 
3. Nobis castra mi- 
nientibus, Galli 
pervénérunt, U

-P-A-G-E-172
  152 ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 
Observe that the ablative absolutes, Germanis victis, 
oppidd expugnato, nobis minientibus, are translated in a 
variety of ways. In translating an ablative absolute, one 
must use judgment in selecting a translation that is con- 
sistent with the meaning of the main verb. 
Notice that the ablative absolute construction is used 
only when the participle does not agree with a noun of the 
main clause (the word “absolute” means that the ablative 
phrase stands by itself). For example, such a sentence as 
“When the Gauls had been conquered, they returned 
home’’ would be rendered, Galli victi domum rediérunt, 
and the ablative absolute construction would not be used, 
because it is possible to make victi agree with Galli, which 
is the subject of rediérunt. 
316. Since the verb sum has no present participle, two 
substantives, or a substantive or pronoun and an ad- 
jective, are sometimes used in the ablative absolute con- 
struction. 
Duce Caesare | lit. Caesar (being) leader, 
Romani under the leadership of Caesar, 
semper if Caesar was their leader, 
vincébant, | when Caesar was their leader, the Romans 
always used 
to conquer. 
317. Remember that the Latin perfect participle is 
passive, there being no perfect active participle. The 
ablative absolute is often used to supply this lack of a per- 
fect active participle; for example, the sentence “ Caesar 
having done this returned to Rome” cannot be expressed 
literally in Latin. It must be changed to the passive form, 
“This having been done, Caesar returned to Rome,” and 
then it may be rendered : hic facté, Caesar Romam rediit.

LESSON 55 
INDIRECT DISCOURSE. SIMPLE STATEMENTS 
327. The words or thoughts of a person may be quoted 
either directly or indirectly. A direct quotation (2.2. direct 
discourse) is one which gives the exact words or thoughts 
of the original speaker or writer. An indirect quotation 
(z.e. indirect discourse) is one in which instead of the orig- 
inal words or thoughts we have their substance (general 
sense) stated in the words of another. 
The English sentence, “I am present,” when quoted di- 
rectly, is stated thus: ‘He said, ‘I am present.’” When 
-quoted indirectly, it assumes this form: “He said that he 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  158 ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 
was present,” or, after a present tense of the verb of 
saying, “He says that he is present.” An indirect state- 
ment, then, is generally introduced in English by the word 
“that,” although this may be omitted, as, “ He says (that) 
he is coming.” 
328. Examine carefully the following : 
DiREcT DISCOURSE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
ti venis, you are coming. dicit té venire, he says that 
you are coming, or he says 
you are coming. 
Note 
1. That the English generally expresses the indirect state- 
ment by a clause introduced by “that” (expressed or 
understood ). 
2. That there is no word in Latin to correspond to the 
“that” in English. 
3. That the Latin changes the verb of the direct statement 
to the infinitive, and changes the case of the subject 
to the accusative. 
329. RuLr.— Indirect Discourse. — Simple statements, 
when quoted indirectly after verbs of saying, knowing, 
thinking, and perceiving, are expressed by the infinitive with 
its subject in the accusative. 
330. Review 308. The tenses of the infinitive do not 
follow the tense of the introductory verb. Like the tenses 
of the participle, they merely denote time relative to that 
of the main verb. The present infinitive describes an 
action as going on at the time of the main verb, the perfect 
as completed by (before) that time, the future as not yet 
begun at that time.

The common uses of the subjunctive in dependent clauses 
are considered in this lesson and those following. Its uses 
in independent clauses are treated in Lessons 67, 71, 72, 73. 
350. Examine the following: 
1. Romam venit ut suum amicum videat, “e comes to Rome 
that he may see his friend, in order that he may see 
his friend, in order to see his friend, to see his friend, 
Sor the purpose of seeing his friend. 
2. Vir in urbem fugit né interficiatur, the man flees into the 
city that he may not be killed, so that he may not be 
killed, in order not to be killed, lest he be killed. 
a. Observe that the verbs of the dependent clauses ut suum 
amicum videat and né interficidtur are subjunctive, 
and that they express the purpose of the action of 
the main clauses, ut (¢#a¢) introducing an affirmative 
and né (¢hat . . . not) a negative clause. 
6. Notice that the purpose clauses may be translated in a 
variety of ways. Purpose clauses may be translated 
by the English infinitive, but never use the Latin 
infinitive to express purpose. 
351. RuLE.—Subjunctive of Purpose. — Purpose may be 
expressed by the present or imperfect subjunctive with ut if

ferd (527); of possum (522); of f10 (526); of vol, ndld, 
malo (524). 
Observe that the first person of the perfect active sub- 
junctive of all verbs may be found by adding -erim to the 
perfect stem; that the pluperfect active subjunctive may 
be found by adding the personal endings to the perfect 
active infinitive; that the perfect and pluperfect passive 
subjunctive are compound forms, like the same tenses of 
the indicative. 
369. Examine the following: 
DIRECT QUESTION INDIRECT QUESTION 
Ubi sunt? where are they ? Scid ubi sint, 7 know where 
Quid facit? what zs he doing ? they are. 
Vidimus quid faceret, we saw 
what he was doing. 
Observe that when a direct question is asked indirectly, 
depending upon some introductory verb, the verb of 
the original direct. question becomes subjunctive in the 
indirect. 
1 See 311, 6; 315. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 175 
Caution. — Do not confuse an indirect question with an 
indirect statement (327). Indirect questions may be recog- 
nized by the fact that some interrogative word follows the 
main or introductory verb. 
INDIRECT QUESTION INDIRECT STATEMENT 
Scid quis veniat, Scid eum venire, 
L know who ts coming. L know (that) he ts coming. 
370. RuLE. —Indirect Question. — The verb of an in- 
direct question ts in the subjunctive. 
371. It has been noticed in the three preceding lessons 
that the tense of a dependent subjunctive depends upon 
the tense of the verb of the main clause. This use of the 
tenses follows a principle called the Seguence of Tenses, a 
principle that is familiar from English usage. Compare: 
He comes that I may see him. 
He came that I might see him. 
The change from may to might accompanies the change 
of the main verb from comes to came. This change of 
tenses, therefore, is not peculiar to Latin. 
372. All tenses are divided into two classes, as follows : 
Present Indicative, 
Perfect Indicative, some- 
Primary or principal tenses, times, when it means have, 
denoting present or future ) Future Indicative,

Observe what tenses of the subjunctive follow primary 
tenses of the indicative, and what tenses follow secondary. 
374. RuLE.— Sequence of Tenses. — Whenever the sub- 
junctive is used in a dependent or subordinate clause, the 
tense that should be used is determined commonly by the 
following rule: 
A primary tense in the main clause is followed by a pri- 
mary tense in the dependent subjunctive clause; a secondary 
tense in the main clause is followed by a secondary tense in 
the dependent subjunctive clause. 
1. Sometimes the perfect indicative, when it means have, 
has, . . ., is followed by a primary tense.

SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES 
378. A substantive clause is a clause used as a noun, 
especially as subject or object of a verb. In the following 
examples the substantive clauses are italicized : 
I know what he has done. (As object.) 
I know (haz) he has come. (As object.) 
(As subject, or in appo- 
sition with subject.) 
He persuaded us Zo leave the city. (As object.) 
We feared that he might die. (As object.) 
I do not doubt that he will go. (As object.) 
He ordered us Zo leave the city. (As object.) It happened chat he was present. { 
It will be observed from these examples that substantive 
clauses are expressed in English in several ways. In Latin 
substantive clauses are usually expressed either by the in- 
finitive or by the subjunctive. This use of the infinitive in 
indirect discourse and as complementary infinitive, and of the 
subjunctive in indirect questions, we have already considered. 
379. Subjunctive clauses introduced by ut or né are very 
often used in Latin as the object of verbs signifying to ask, 
command, advise, resolve, urge, persuade, permit, strive, decree. 
As an infinitive phrase is used in English as the object of 
such verbs, while ut or né and the subjunctive is used in 
Latin, this difference in usage must be carefully noted.

Cum, meaning wen (cum temporal, sentences 1, 2, 3), is 
used with the indicative if the verb of its clause refers to 
present or future time. Cum, meaning wen, after, is com- 
monly used with the subjunctive, if the verb of its clause 
refers to past time, but the indicative is sometimes used to 
point out clearly the exact time at which the main action 
took place (cum then = qué tempore). Cum, meaning szzce 
or as, is called cum causal, and the verb is subjunctive 
(sentence 4). Cum, meaning a/though, is called cum con- 
cessive, and the verb is subjunctive (sentence 5). The 
student will be able to infer from the meaning of the whole 
sentence which of the three translations cum should have 
in a given case. What must it mean with the indicative?

GERUND AND GERUNDIVE 
403. Carefully distinguish the difference in English 
between a verbal noun and a verbal adjective. They both 
end in -zzg, the verbal noun being used like a noun in any 
of the cases, and the verbal adjective, or participle, like an 
adjective, always in agreement with some word. Both have 
the force of a verb, and may therefore take an object. 
Compare these examples: 
I found my friends wazting for me. (Participle, or 
verbal adjective.) 
Waiting is tedious. (Verbal noun, subject of “is.”’) 
We learn to do by doing. (Verbal noun.) 
404. In Latin, the gerund is a verbal noun. It has only 
the genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases, the 
1 Review page 15, footnote, and page 27, footnote 1,

nominative case being supplied by the infinitive. Its 
gender is neuter. Zhe gerundive ts a verbal adjective (see 
308), and is passive in its meaning.

verbs (516-520). Note that they are formed from the 
present stem.

SUPPLEMENTARY LESSONS 
Nore TO THE TEACHER. — These lessons are designed to meet the needs 
of those teachers who wish a more extensive treatment of syntax than has been 
attempted in the previous lessons. They are so arranged that they may be 
taken up in connection with the previous lessons, or in any order that the 
teacher wishes. 
LESSON 71 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES. PRESENT AND PAST TIME 
413. Conditional sentences are complex sentences. They 
consist of two clauses, the condztion (or protasis) introduced 
by “if,” “if not,” “unless,” and the conclusion (or apodosis). 
For example : 
If it rains, I shall not go. 
If he had not seen me, I should have gone. 
You will not do this unless I command you. 
Observe that a condition may be expressed in English 
without using “if,” “if not,” “unless,” by merely placing 
the subject after the verb in the condition. For example: 
Had he not seen me, I should have gone. 
414. Various classifications of conditional sentences are 
possible, but for convenience they will be considered as 
follows : 
I. Conditions referring to present or past time. 
1. Simple. 
2. Contrary to Fact. 
196
-P-A-G-E-223
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 197 
II. Conditions referring to future time. 
1. Vivid Future. 
2. Less Vivid Future. 
415. SIMPLE CONDITION 
Examine the following : 
1. Si hoc faciunt, bene est, f they are doing this, it is well. 
2. Si hoc fécérunt, bene fuit, 2f they did this, it was well. 
a. Observe that the condition (or protasis) does not imply 
whether the statement is true or not, z.e. whether 
“they did this” or not; it merely makes a supposition. 
6, That the present or past tenses of the indicative are 
used in both condition and conclusion. 
416. CONTRARY TO FACT CONDITIONS 
Examine the following : 
1. Si hoc facerent, bene esset, 7f hey were (now) doing this, 
it would be well. 
2. Si hoc fécissent, bene fuisset, 7f they had done this, tt 
would have been well. 
a. Observe that the condition (or protasis) makes a suppo- 
sition that is obviously contrary to the actual facts of 
the case; 7.¢. the first sentence implies that they are 
not now doing this, and the second sentence, that 
they had not done this. So too the conclusion (or 
apodosis) makes a statement contrary to the facts; 
z.é. the first sentence implies that it is not now well, 
the second sentence that it was not well. 
6. That the zmperfect subjunctive is used in both condition 
and conclusion, when the time is present, and the 
pluperfect subjunctive, when the time is past.

Examine the following: 
Si hoc facient, bene erit, 7f they do this (i.e. shall do this), it 
will be well, 
a. Observe that the condition (or protasis) states a future 
supposition vividly or strongly (7.c. by using “shall”’). 
6. That the conclusion (or apodosis) states positively what 
will be the result, if the condition shall prove to be true. 
c. That the future indicative is used in both condition and 
conclusion.
-P-A-G-E-225
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 199 
d. That the present tense in English may often refer to 
future time (ze. “if they do this” means “if they 
shall do this’’). 
419. Less Vivip FUTURE CONDITIONS 
Examine the following : 
Si hoc faciant, bene sit, zf they should do this, it would be 
well. 
a. Observe that the condition (or protasis) here states a 
future supposition in a less distinct and vivid fashion 
(z.e. by using “should ’’). 
6. That the conclusion (or apodosis) states less positively, 
as a mere possibility, what the result would be, should 
the condition prove to be true. 
¢. That the present subjunctive is used in both condition 
and conclusion. 
420. SumMaryY OF CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 
I. Present or Past Time. 
1. Simple. Present or past tenses of the indicative in both 
parts. 
2. Contrary to Fact. 
a. Present time —imperfect subjunctive in both parts. 
6. Past time — pluperfect subjunctive in both parts. 
II. Future Time. 
1. Vivid Future — Future ! indicative in both parts. 
2. Less Vivid Future — Present! subjunctive in both parts. 
421. It has been indicated in 311, 5, 315, 2, and 316 
that the condition (or protasis) may be expressed by the 
participle without the use of si or nisi. For example: 
1 For the sake of clearness the use of other tenses in the protasis of future 
conditions is not here treated.

LESSON 73 
WISHES 
423. Wishes may be divided into two classes: 
I. Those that refer to the future. For example: 
May my friend come! 
Would that my friend would come! 
O that my friend would come! 
Observe that the above expressions are different ways 
of expressing the same desire. -
-P-A-G-E-227
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 20% 
II. Those that refer to present or past time, and that 
wish for something which (it is implied) is not or was not 
attained. They are, therefore, sometimes called hopeless 
wishes. For example: 
referring to pres- 
ent time, and 
implying that he 
is not here. O that my friend were here! 
I wish (that) my friend were here! 
Would that my friend were here! 
referring to past 
time, and imply- 
ing that he was 
not here. O that my friend had been here! 
I wish (that) my friend had been here! 
Would that my friend had been here! 
424. Examine the following: 
1. (Utinam) meus amicus veniat, may my friend come! 
(a wish about the future). 
2. Utinam meus amicus adesset, would that my friend were 
here! (a wish hopeless in present time, implying 
that he is not here). 
3. Utinam meus amicus adfuisset, O that my friend had 
been here! (a wish hopeless in past time, implying 
that he was not here). 
a. Observe that the subjunctive is used to express a wish. 
6. That the present (or perfect) subjunctive expresses a 
wish relating to the future, that the imperfect sub- 
junctive expresses a wish that is hopeless in present 
time, and the pluperfect a wish hopeless in past time. 
. That hopeless wishes employ the same mood and tenses 
as contrary to fact conditions (416). Dp 
Utinam is often omitted with the present tense, but is 
regularly used with the imperfect or pluperfect. The 
negative is né.

LESSON 74 
INDIRECT DISCOURSE. COMPLEX SENTENCES 
427. Review 327-330, 349. When a complex sentence 
is quoted indirectly, its principal or main verb, if the main 
clause makes a statement (affirmative or negative),? follows 
the rule stated in 329. Its dependent verb follows this law: 
Each dependent verb becomes subjunctive, Its tense 
depends upon the tense of the introductory verb of saying, 
thinking, etc., in accordance with the principle of sequence 
of tenses (374). 
428. Pronouns in Indirect Discourse. — In changing from 
direct to indirect discourse, pronouns of the first and 
1 Plural of inquit. ? The treatment of main clauses involving command 
has been purposely excluded from this book.  
-P-A-G-E-229
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 203 
second persons are generally changed to pronouns of the 
third person. The reflexive pronouns refer commonly to 
the subject of the introductory verb, but sometimes to the 
subject of the verb of their own clause. 
429. Examine the following : 
DIRECT DISCOURSE INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
Present Time 
Vir quem vided meus amicus Dicit virum quem videat suum 
est, the man whom I see is amicum esse, “e says that 
my friend. the man whom he sees ts 
his friend. 
Past Time 
Dixit virum quem vidéret 
suum amicum esse, /e 
said that the man whom 
he saw was his friend. 
Observe 
a. That the main verb est becomes esse with its subject 
virum in the accusative. 
é. That the dependent (or subordinate) verb vided becomes 
present subjunctive, videat, when the introductory 
verb, dicit, is a primary tense, and imperfect subjunc- 
tive, vidéret, when the introductory verb, dixit, is a 
secondary tense. 
c. That the person of the dependent verb changes to the 
third person, and that meus becomes suum, because it 
refers to the subject of the introductory verb. 
430. RuLE.— Moods in Indirect Discourse. — Jz indirect 
discourse the main verbs, if the clauses in which they stand make 
statements, are in the infinitive with sulject accusative, and 
the subordinate (or dependent) verbs are in the subjunctive.

LESSON 75 
IMPERSONAL USE OF VERBS. SUPINE. DIFFERENT 
WAYS OF EXPRESSING PURPOSE 
432. Verbs are said to be used impersonally when they 
do not have a personal subject. This impersonal use is 
more common in Latin than in English. There are some 
verbs in Latin that are used only impersonally, while others 
are used both personally and impersonally. 
EXAMPLES 
Acriter pugnatum est, the dattle was fought sharply, or there 
was sharp fighting (literally, 7¢ was sharply fought). 
1 because. 2 ago, treat. 3 impero.
-P-A-G-E-231
ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 205 
Vos hoc facere oportet, you ought to do this (more literally, 
zt is proper that you do this). 
Vobis hoc facere licet, you may do this (literally, 2¢ 7s per 
mitted to you to do this). 
433. The supine is a verbal noun of the fourth declen- 
sion, and has forms only in -um and -i. These forms are 
used only in the following constructions : 
Légati vénérunt ad Caesarem gratulatum, ambassadors came 
to congratulate Caesar. 
Hoc difficile est factii, ¢i7s is difficult to do. 
The supine in -um is used to express purpose, but only 
after verbs of motion; the supine in -i is used with a few ad- 
jectives and indeclinable nouns, as ablative of specification. 
434. Various Ways OF EXPRESSING PURPOSE 
Review 351, 364, 406, 3. Are there several ways of 
expressing purpose in English?

(READING SELECTION 465) 
LESSON 76 
PERIPHRASTIC CONJUGATIONS 
437. The first or active periphrastic conjugation is formed 
by the future active participle and the verb sum. It is future 
in its meaning, and expresses the idea conveyed in English 
by the phrases “about to,” “going to,” “intend to.” For 
example: 
Laudatirus est, Ze zs about to praise, or is going to praise, 
or zxtends to praise. 
For all forms of this conjugation, see 529. 
It has been noticed that there is no future or future per- 
fect tense in the subjunctive. The subjunctive of the first 
periphrastic conjugation may be used in their place. For 
example: 
Scid quem visirus sit, / know whom he is going to see, or 
whom he will see. 
438. The second or passive periphrastic conjugation is 
formed by the gerundive and the verb sum. It is passive 
1direction. * to see his daughters : express in three ways.
-P-A-G-E-233
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 207 
in its meaning, and expresses the idea of obligation or 
necessity. For example: 
Laudandus est, he ought to be praised, or he must be praised 
(literally, Ze zs to be praised ). 
For all forms of this conjugation, see 530. 
439. USES OF THE PASSIVE PERIPHRASTIC CONJUGATION 
1. The person for whom the obligation or necessity exists 
is expressed by the dative. 
2. Since the conjugation is passive, all active English sen- 
tences must be recast before they are the equivalent 
literally of this Latin construction. Thus: “I must 
do this” = “For me this is to be done,” id mihi 
agendum est. 
3. Intransitive verbs are used impersonally in this conju- 
gation in Latin. Thus: “We ought to come,” ndbis 
veniendum est. 
EXAMPLES 
Urbs est miinienda, the city must be fortified. 
Nobis fortiter pugnandum est, we ought to (or must) fight 
bravely (literally, for us it is to be fought bravely). 
Caesari omnia erant agenda, Caesar had to do everything 
(literally, for Caesar everything was to be done).

6. Labienus had to cross the river. 7. Caesar asked who 
was going to remain with him. 8. The ambassadors will

NOTE: 
TuE following exercises are intended to provide additional 
material for the rapid reading of connected prose. Each selec- 
tion is based on the vocabulary and constructions already acquired. 
Nothing has been admitted that has not been previously studied, 
with the exception of a very few necessary words, all of which are 
indicated by superior figures and translated in footnotes. Such 
words, however, present no additional difficulty in form or con- 
struction. Proper names which have no English form, or are 
readily recognizable, are used without explanation; ¢. g., Corio- 
lanus, Washingtonius. 
The exercises have been prepared for use after every third 
lesson. The subject matter chosen is intentionally largely non- 
classical, in order that the beginner may realize as early as possible 
that the Latin language is adapted to the expression of modern as 
well as ancient thought.

  SUMMARY OF RULES OF SYNTAX 
Nominative Case. — The subject of a finite verb is always 
in the nominative case. [34, 1.] 
A predicate adjective agrees in number, gender, and case 
with the word to which it refers. — A predicate noun agrees 
in case (only) with the word to which it refers. [34, 2.] 
Genitive Case. — The genitive is used to limit or define 
the meaning of a noun. [38.] 
The genitive of the whole (partitive genitive), denoting 
the whole from which a part is (or is not) taken is used 
with nouns, pronouns, adjectives (except numerals), and 
adverbs. The part taken is denoted by the noun, pronoun, 
etc., on which the genitive depends. [251.] 
The ablative or the genitive of a noun, @f ztself modified 
by an adjective or genitive, may be used to describe a person 
or object. The genitive is less common in this use than 
the ablative; it occurs chiefly in expressions of measure or 
number, and in phrases consisting of nouns modified by 
magnus, maximus, summus, tantus. [303.] 
Dative Case. — The indirect object of a verb is in the 
dative case. [58, 2.] 
The dative is used with adjectives denoting Likeness, 
Fitness, Nearness, Service, Inclination, and the like, and 
also with their opposites. [163.] 
The dative is used with es?, sunt, etc., to denote the pos- 
sessor, the thing possessed being the subject. [231.] 
282
-P-A-G-E-315
  ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 283 
The dative is used with swm and a few other verbs to 
denote the purpose or end of the act or state expressed by 
the verb. Commonly there is combined with the dative of 
purpose another dative denoting the person interested in 
the purpose or end, or affected by it. [295.] 
Most verbs signifying to favor, help, please, trust, and 
their contraries; also to believe, persuade, command, obey, 
serve, resist, envy, threaten, pardon, and spare, take the 
dative case. [343.] 
Many verbs compounded with ad, ante, con, in, inter, 0b, 
post, prae, pro, sub, and super, often govern the dative. [394.] 
Accusative Case. — The direct object of a transitive verb 
is in the accusative case. [46, 2.] 
The subject of the infinitive is in the accusative. 
[184, 1.] 
Place to which is expressed by the accusative with ad 
or 7z,; with names of towns, domus, humus, and ris, by the 
accusative without a preposition. [237, 2.] 
Extent of time or space is expressed by the accusative. 
[245.] 
Ablative Case. — The means or instrument of an action 
is expressed by the ablative without a preposition. [94.] 
Cause is expressed by the ablative, usually without a 
preposition. [118.] 
Time when or within which is expressed by the ablative 
without a preposition. [131.] 
The personal agent with a passive verb is expressed by 
the ablative with @ or ad. [142.] 
Manner is expressed by the ablative with the preposition 
cum, but cum may be omitted if an adjective is used with 
the ablative. [148.]
-P-A-G-E-316
  284 ESSENTIALS OF LATIN 
The ablative of specification tells in what respect the 
meaning of a verb, noun, or adjective applies. No prepo- 
sition is used. [157.] 
Verbs meaning to separate, remove, set free, deprive, 
lack, etc., are often followed by the ablative of the thing 
from which separation takes place. Ad or ex with the 
ablative is, however, often used with these verbs, regularly 
when the separation is literal and physical (not figurative) 
and the ablative denotes a person. But with caveda prepo- 
sition is never used. [211.] 
Place where is expressed by the ablative with zz; but 
with names of towns, domus, humus, and ris, by the loca- 
tive. [237, 1.] 
Place from which is expressed by the ablative with aé, 
dé, or ex, with names of towns, domus, humus, and riis, by 
the ablative without a preposition. [237, 3.] 
In expressions involving a comparative with guam the 
same case is used after gvam as before it. After compara- 
tives without gwam the ablative is used. [260.] 
The measure of difference is expressed in connection 
with the comparative degree by the ablative without a prep- 
osition. [267.] 
The ablative or the genitive of a noun, ¢f 7tself modified 
by an adjective or genitive, may be used to describe a per- 
son or object. The genitive is less common in this use than 
the ablative ; it occurs chiefly in expressions of measure or 
number, and in phrases consisting of nouns modified by 
magnus, maximus, summus, tantus. [ 303. ] 
The ablative is used with the deponent verbs aor, fruor, 
JSungor, potior, and véscor, and their compounds. [337. ]

PEARSON’S LATIN PROSE 
COMPOSITION 
By HENRY CARR PEARSON, Horace Mann School, 
Teachers College, New York, 
Cop ete ys tech a ay segues 
Part II, Based on Caesar . 
Part III, Based on Cicero 
HIS book combines a thorough and systematic study of 
the essentials of Latin syntax with abundant practice in 
translating English into Latin; and affords constant prac- 
tice in writing Latin at sight. It meets the most exacting 
college entrance requirements. 
4 Part I is a summary of the fundamental principles of Latin 
grammar and syntax, and contains clear, concise explanations 
of many points that are troublesome to the ordinary pupil. It 
is divided into graded lessons of convenient length, each Jes- 
son including English-Latin exercises for practice. References 
to all the leading grammars are also given. 
4j Part I contains short, disconnected English sentences and 
some continuous narrative based on Books I-IV of Caesar’s 
Gallic War. Part III presents material for translation into 
Latin based upon Cicero. ‘There are also exercises for gen- 
eral review preparatory to college entrance examinations. 
4j A valuable feature of the book is the Review Lessons, in- 
troduced at intervals. These contain lists of important words 
for vocabulary study, and together with the summaries of 
grammatical principles afford excellent material for review 
work and practice in sight translation. For purposes of em- 
phasis and intensive study, typical Latin sentences, illustrating 
important grammatic usages, idioms, and phrases are placed at 
the head of each chapter based on Books I and II of Caesar 
and the first Catilinian oration of Cicero.

LATIN GRAMMARS By ALBERT HARKNESS, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor 
Emeritus in Brown University 
Complete Latin Grammar, $1.25 Short LatinGrammar. . $0.80 
Pht text-books represent the latest advances in philo- 
logical science, and embody the results of the author’s 
large experience in teaching, and of his own linguistic 
studies, together with the suggestions and advice of eminent 
German specialists in the field of historical and comparative 
grammar. 
4| Throughout each volume the instruction has been adapted 
to present methods and present needs. A special effort has 
been made to develop the practical side of grammar, to make 
it as helpful as possible to the teacher in explaining the force 
of involved constructions in Latin authors, and to the learner 
in understanding and appreciating the thought in a compli- 
cated Latin sentence. 
4] The COMPLETE LATIN GRAMMAR is designed to 
meet the needs of Latin students in both schools and colleges. 
Simplicity and clearness of presentation, as well as of language, 
form leading characteristics of the work. Attention is directed 
particularly to the arrangement of material, and to the treat- 
ment of etymology, syntax, moods. and tenses, subjunctive, 
indirect discourse, and hidden quantity. 
4| The SHORT LATIN GRAMMAR iis intended for 
those who prefer to begin with a more elementary manual, 
or for those who do not contemplate a collegiate course. In 
its preparation the convenience and interest of the student have 
been carefully consulted. The paradigms, rules, and dis- 
cussions have in general been introduced in the exact form 
and language of the Complete Latin Grammar, by which it 
may at any time be supplemented. The numbering of the 
sections in the two books is also alike.

EPISODES FROM CAESAR’S 
GALLIG AND CIVIL WARS 
Edited by MAURICE W. MATHER, Ph.D., formerly 
Instructor in Latin, Harvard University 
$1.25 
HIS volume presents interesting and important parts 
of both the Gallic and Civil Wars, and for this 
reason differs from all other editions of Caesar. The 
selections from the Gallic War are equivalent in amount to 
the first four books, and include the account of the Helvetian 
War in the first book, the conflict with the Nervii in the 
second, the entire third and fourth books, the description 
of- Britain and the Britons in the fifth book, the comparison 
of the Gauls and the Germans in the sixth, the failure at 
Gergovia and the grand success at Alesia in the seventh. 
From the Civil War about two-thirds as much is taken, 
including Curio’s disastrous African campaign in the 
second book, and the struggle between Caesar and Pompey, 
ending with the latter’s overthrow and death, in the third 
book. 
{| The notes on the first and second books of the Gallic War 
are adapted to the needs of classes which begin their study of 
Caesar with either book. Long vowels are marked, and sum- 
maries and frequent topical headings supply the thread of the 
narrative. The introduction contains the lives of Caesar and 
Pompey, a brief description of Caesar’s army, and a list 
of books useful in the study of Caesar. 
4] An innovation which will meet with general approval is 
the printing in full in the vocabulary of the principal parts of 
verbs and of the genitive of nouns, except in the first conjuga- 
tion of verbs, and in such nouns of the first, second, and 
fourth declensions as offer no possibility of mistake. Deriva- 
tions are adequately explained. The book is abundantly 
supplied with illustrations, maps, and plans.

VIRGIL’?S AENEID Edited by HENRY S. FRIEZE, late Professor of Latin, Uni- 
versity of Michigan. Revised by WALTER H. DEN- 
NISON, Professor of Latin, University of Michigan 
First Six Books . . . . $1.30 Complete. 
Complete Text Edition. . $0.50 
N its present form this well-known work has been thor- 
oughly revised and modernized. It is published in two 
volumes: one containing the first six books, the other the 
entire twelve books—an arrangement especially convenient for 
students who read more than the minimum College Entrance 
Requirements in Latin. Both volumes are printed on very 
thin opaque paper, thus making each an extraordinarily 
compact and usable book. 
9] The introduction has been enlarged by the addition of 
sections on the life and writings of Virgil, the plan of the 
Aeneid, the meter, manuscripts, editions, and helpful books 
of reference. 
{| The text has been corrected to conform to the readings that 
have become established, and the spellings are in accord with 
the evidence of inscriptions of the first century A.D, To meet 
the need of early assistance in reading the verse metrically, 
the long vowels in the first two books are fully indicated. 
4] The notes have been thoroughly revised, and largely added 
to. ‘The old grammar references are corrected, and new ones 
added. The literary appreciation of the poet is increased by 
parallel quotations from English literature. The irregularities 
of scansion in each book are given with sufficient explanations. 
| The vocabulary has been made as simple as possible, and 
includes only those words occurring in the Aeneid. The 
illustrations and maps, for the most part, are new and fresh, 
and have been selected with great care, with a view to assist- 
ing directly in the interpretation of the text.

BISHOP, KING AND HELM’S 
CICERO 
Edited by J. REMSEN BISHOP, Ph.D., Principal, 
Eastern High School, Detroit; FREDERICK ALWIN 
KING, Ph.D., Instructor in Latin and Greek, Hughes 
High School, Cincinnati; and NATHAN WILBUR 
HELM, A.M., Principal, Evanston (Ill.) Academy of 
Northwestern University. 
Ten Orations and Selected Letters. 1.25 
Six Orations. $1.00 
HIS edition is issued in two forms: one containing the 
six orations most frequently required by colleges for 
entrance—the Manilian Law, the four orations against 
Catiline, and Archias; the other giving, in addition, the Milo, 
Marcellus, Ligarius, and Murena, and selections from the 
Letters. The Murena is included because it exhibits Cicero’s 
powers to a generous degree, aud with the Milo affords 
material for rapid reading. 
{| Quantities are marked in accordance with the most modern 
scholarship. The illustrations and plans have been carefully 
selected to picture the environment of the orator as it was in 
the Republican, and not as it was in the Imperial, period. 
The source of each illustration is accurately indicated. 
| The aim of this edition has been helpfulness toward an 
appreciation of Cicero and of his literary work and the 
exclusion of borrowed or original erudition. Such help as 
seemed to be required by the ordinary student is freely given, 
but the smoothing out of difficulties which the pupil may 
reasonably be expected to conquer by himself has been 
avoided. Grammatical principles are enunciated as far as 
possible, and references to the leading Latin grammars are 
given. The notes contain much assistance in translation and 
are clearly expressed. The vocabulary contains carefully 
prepared renderings of the words and phrases used in the texts.

JANES’S SECOND YEAR LATIN 
FOR SIGHT READING 
Edited by A. L. JANES, Instructor in Latin, Boys’ High 
School, Brooklyn 
40 cents 
HIS book has been prepared to meet the Latin sight 
reading requirements of the College Entrance Exam- 
ination Board, and is intended to follow the intensive 
reading of Books I and II of Caesar’s Gallic War. All 
words which Professor Lodge in The Vocabulary of High 
School Latin has shown should be mastered by the end of 
the second year are printed in full-faced type in the text 
where they first occur. The footnotes include the meanings 
of the less usual words, unusual meanings of common words, 
hints on derivation and translation, and synonyms. 
BARSS’S THIRD YEAR LATIN 
FOR SIGHT READING 
Edited by J. EDMUND BARSS, Latin Master, 
Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Conn. 
40 cents 
HE purpose of this work is identical with that of 
Janes’s Second Year Latin for Sight Reading, which it 
is intended to follow. The treatment of vocabulary, 
idiom, and construction is therefore much the same as in the 
earlier volume, but since the pupil has now acquired the 
greater power of reading at sight, the assistance afforded in 
the way of footnotes and vocabulary is not quite so extensive. 
The book covers more than twice the amount specified by 
the requirements.

THE WORKS OF OVID 
Edited by FRANK J. MILLER, Ph.D. (Yale), 
Professor of Latin, University of Chicago    
    Annotated Edition. . . $1.40 Text Edition 
   HESE selections are fairly representative, and are 
edied in such a way as to illustrate the style and 
subject-matter of each poem, and at the same time to 
show the exact relation of every part to the complete 
work. 
§| The book includes over 3,800 lines from the Meta- 
morphoses, thus more than meeting the requirements in Ovid 
of the College Entrance Examination Board, and in addition 
the following: Selections from Heroides, Amores, Ars 
Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, Fasti, Tristia, and Epistulae ex 
Ponto ; Life of Ovid, Poetic Forms of Ovid’s Works; with 
notes on the selections, and vocabulary. 
“| The notes have been prepared with special reference to 
the needs of both the school and the college student. They 
include: General assis‘ance in the translation of difficult 
and obscure passages ; judicious references on points of syntax 
to all the modern school grammars in common use ; notes 
and comments upon points of antiquarian interest ; and sug- 
gestions and illustrations of the relations of Ovid’s stories to 
their earlier sources, and especially of their effect upon English 
literature. 
| The vocabulary, which has been prepared especially 
for this volume, gives the literal meaning of each word, 
and also all of the typical meanings which occur in the 
text. Generous assistance in word derivation is offered 
as well.

this book are: Atalanta’s Last Race; Pyramus and 
Thisbe ; Apollo’s Unrequited Love for Daphne ; 
How Phaéton Drove his Father’s Chariot ; The Death of

| There is a distinct advantage in using these selections 
from Ovid as a stepping-stone from Caesar to Virgil. 
Written in an entertaining manner, they not only make the 
student acquainted with the legends of the gods and heroes, 
but also lessen the greatest gap in a continuous Latin course by 
familiarizing him with the vocabulary of Virgil in easier verse. 
In the present volume are all but 300 of the words found in 
the first book of the Aeneid. 
§| The work contains about 1,420 lines of text, with full 
notes on the text and on scansion, and a vocabulary. The 
first hundred lines are divided into feet for scansion, with the 
accents and caesuras marked. The first three stories are 
accompanied by a parallel version in the order of ordinary 
Latin prose, with the quantities indicated. There are also 
synonyms of words not usual in prose, and of common 
words in extraordinary uses.

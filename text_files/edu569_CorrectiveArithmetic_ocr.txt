EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
PEOPLE engaged in educational research have known for 
some time that a very distinctive piece of work was being 
done by the Director of Educational Measurements of the 
Wisconsin State Department of Public Instruction. This 
work was begun by Dr. W. W. Theisen; and it has been 
carried forward with unusual effectiveness by Dr. W. J. 
Osburn, the author of this book. 
Dr. Osburn’s contribution to the technique of teaching 
has consisted in the development of an analysis of errors 
and in the adjustment of remedial measures to the condi- 
tions exhibited by these errors. In this procedure he has 
used many of the existing means of measurement and has 
devised others. He has been peculiarly successful in secur- 
ing the codperation of the school people of Wisconsin; and 
his success in this direction is undoubtedly attributable to 
the recognized merit of his method. The various bulletins 
which he has issued to the schools of his State have at- 
tracted favorable attention in other States. These bul- 
letins, however, were not issued in sufficient quantities to 
be available to teachers outside of Wisconsin nor, indeed, 
to any but a very few principals and superintendents. 
When, therefore, Dr. Osburn found himself in a position to 
put these matters, together with the rational basis upon 
which they rest, into the form of a book, it immediately 
became evident to those whom he consulted that such a 
systematic presentation of his doctrine would be of un- 
questionable advantage. 
Although Dr. Osburn’s interest was by no means con- 
fined to a single school subject, it is undoubtedly true that 
IBRARY L 714 1. MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE COLLEGE MIIREREF GRAD:

iv EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
his technique was more fully exhibited in the case of arith- 
metic than in the case of any other subject. He was there- 
fore right in formulating his method with reference to the 
subject on which he could furnish the greatest detail. The 
result is the book which he now submits. It is quite evi- 
dently a book which has grown out of actual practice, and 
as such it will make its greatest appeal to those who are 
engaged in actual teaching service. It is essentially a book 
for teachers. In spite of that fact — indeed, I think be- 
cause of it —it is of first-rate importance for those who 
train and supervise teachers. 
In my judgment, those who read it will find in it a stim- 
ulating point of view especially as relates to the analysis of 
the errors which children make in arithmetic. Custom- 
arily, we close our eyes to the nature and causes of error. 
Our attitude is reflected in the ratings which we give to 
pupils. We say, for example, that a child’s paper is worth 
seventy-five per cent, and by this we intend to measure the 
degree of his success. Similarly, we record ratings in our 
classbooks and send them home to parents on report cards. 
These ratings are our estimates of the pupils’ success. In- 
stead of directing our attention and the attention of pupils’ 
and parents to the seventy-five per cent of success, we 
should undoubtedly accomplish more by considering the 
correlative twenty-five per cent of failure. If we examine 
the errors which led to it, and if we try to locate the causes 
of these errors, we shall without question be taking the 
most effective way of increasing the seventy-five per cent 
of success. 
When Dr. Osburn looks into this matter of errors in 
arithmetic, he finds that they are typical and not merely of 
a haphazard character. He finds that the same sort of 
errors are committed in one city as in another and by 
children of every level of intelligence and home influence.
-P-A-G-E-5
    EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION v 
The fact that this is true makes it possible to devise a suc- 
cessful method of meeting these typical difficulties. The 
way in which this is done, the types of material needed for 
the purposes, the penetrating analysis of the task of teach- 
ing arithmetic in the lower grades, the invoking of psy- 
chological principles to rationalize the procedure, the ef- 
fective treatment of diagnosis, drill, and retesting — all 
these, woven into a new and stimulating method of teach- 
ing, have been presented concretely by the author of this 
book. It is rightly called “Corrective Arithmetic.” It 
proceeds, first, to set up what must be taught; second, to 
find out in what particulars pupils fall short of knowing 
the things they should know; third, to analyze the causes 
of their failure; fourth, to apply remedial measures; and, 
fifth, to furnish the material needed in carrying out the 
remedial measures. 
In some ways Dr. Osburn’s book is strikingly original. 
For example, he shows that not forty-five combinations in 
each of the fundamental processes, but a total of nearly 
seventeen hundred combinations must be taught. Because 
a child can subtract 5 from 13 does not at all mean that he 
can subtract 5 from 43. Because he can multiply 6 by 7 
does not mean that he can multiply 7 by 6. Dr. Osburn as- 
serts that we have trusted too implicitly to the doctrine of 
transfer of training. ‘Is it any wonder,” he says, “that 
children make mistakes? . . . Let’s give the child a chance.” 
The /book is offered in the spirit of giving the child a 
chance. It has limitations of some importance, and the 
author is himself clearly aware of them. Undoubtedly 
these limitations will evoke criticism, as indeed they 
should. But to have waited until these limitations could 
have been eliminated would have been to delay the issu- 
ance of a book which despite its limitations appears to have 
pronounced merit. Those who counsel perfection would do

well to look about them and to ascertain who has a perfect 
plan in education and whether the fortunate possessor of 
such a plan is accomplishing as much as Dr. Osburn is ac- 
complishing with his plan in the schools of Wisconsin.

  PREFACE 
  Tuts book is largely a description of some research work 
which the author has been called upon to do in response to 
an insistent demand from teachers, supervisors, and super- 
intendents for some means whereby better results might be 
obtained in the teaching of arithmetic. The problem was 
approached by means of a study of errors made by pupils 
in taking standardized tests. The results of this study 
have been presented in Chapters IV and V and to some ex- 
tent in Chapter VII. The results of previous error studies 
were substantiated and it was proved definitely that errors 
are specific, widespread, and constant. The multiplicity 
of the necessary remedial work led to a review and restate- 
ment of well-known principles of economy in teaching as 
set forth in Chapter II. A further requirement essential 
in successful remedial work is some means by which the 
classroom teacher can diagnose the needs and disabilities 
of her pupils. This technique is presented in Chapter V. 
After the teacher has become aware of the specific diffi- 
culties which her pupils are experiencing, suitable practice 
material must be available for the correction of the dis- 
abilities. A search for such material soon disclosed the in- 
adequate and poorly graded condition of the textbooks 
which are being used. This problem is discussed in 
Chapter VI. 
Busy teachers often have to concentrate their attention 
on the more important things and neglect those which are 
less important. The relative value of subject-matter is 
therefore discussed in Chapter III. Chapter VIII is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii PREFACE 
condensed summary of the facts and laws of Educational 
Psychology as they apply to the teaching of arithmetic. 
Chapter VII give: <pecific suggestions for the work in each 
of the primary grades. Chapter IX relates to means of 
motivation. 
A vast amount of research work remains to be done be- 
fore the final word can be written concerning the teaching 
of arithmetic. In all probability the final word never can 
be written, but that is no reason why each worker in the 
field should cease striving toward the goal. In such a 
spirit this book has been written. The material which it 
contains is by no means complete. It aims only to suggest 
how to do a few things better than they have been done. 
Practically all of the suggestions are now being profitably 
used in many of the schools of Wisconsin. It is hoped that 
the book will prove interesting and helpful in other States 
also. 
The writing of a large part of the book would have been 
utterly impossible had it not been for the hearty and faith- 
ful codperation of scores of superintendents, principals, 
supervisors, and teachers in Wisconsin whose names cannot 
be mentioned here. The author is deeply aware of the ob- 
ligation which he is under to these people and is profoundly 
thankful to them for their cordial support.

  CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
; CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
Can the results of our teaching in the fundamentals of 
arithmetic be improved? This is an old, old question, 
and it may seem to some that there is little need for 
another book in this field. Scores of books have been 
written and teaching devices have greatly multiplied ; 
yet the results of our efforts as teachers remain unsal 
factory. Courtis reports that only thirty per cent of 
our pupils attain a per cent of accuracy above seventy.? 
Business men everywhere deplore the lack of ability 
of their employees to perform with accuracy even the 
simplest of arithmetical processes. Courtis’s results 
show that their complaint is a legitimate one. 
Consider, for example, the young applicant for a job, 
fresh from high school as he goes in search of work. His 
prospective employer may well be expected to ask,:“‘ Can 
you add?” ‘The answer, if truthful under present con- 
ditions, will of necessity be, “ Well, I have completed all 
that the schools had to offer in arithmetic. I learned 
to add. Of course, I can get the correct answer to only’ 
six out of ten problems, but I received passing grades 
from my teachers.” ‘Yet the people are paying a sub- 
stantial price to have their children made masters of these

skills which are fundamental to successful living. If 
inquiries be started in search for the causes of this intol- 
erable condition of affairs, the result is generally nothing 
further than a more or less skillful ‘ passing of the buck.” 
The school board passes it: to the superintendent and 
supervisors, while they in turn pass it on to the teacher. 
The teacher, knowing as she generally does that she has 
labored long and hard, is much perplexed to find a legiti- 
mate excuse. It is true that many pupils do not attend 
school as regularly as they should, and it is also true that 
there is an astonishing tendency for the facts of arith- 
metic to go into one ear of a pupil and out at the other. 
A few of the pupils are utterly incapable of learning the 
arithmetical facts and should not even be allowed to 
attempt them. 
To make matters worse, the elementary-school curric- 
ulum is no longer a simple combination of the three R’s. 
One subject after another has pushed its way into the 
school. We now have spelling, geography, history, 
language, hygiene, civics, music, art, and ever more in- 
sistent demands for economics and sociology. Super- 
vised study and project teaching are adding to the 
demands made on the already overburdened teacher. 
Within the life of the present generation teaching has 
changed from a relatively easy occupation to a tremen- 
dously exacting and nerve-racking one. 
At first sight the outlook for better results is gloomy ; 
but it is the firm belief of the author of this book that 
there is a way out. That way lies along the line of more 
economical methods of teaching based upon a more 
definite conception of the actual needs. The author 
has no intention to discredit in any manner the splendid 
enrichment of curriculum and methods that is now in 
progress. On the contrary, he strongly favors them.

INTRODUCTION 3 
The purpose of this book is to help to make them possible 
by showing how to secure better results in the funda- 
mentals in less time. The studies upon which this work 
is based are still far from complete, but sufficient data 
are now available to warrant some suggestions concern- 
ing improvement which will be both helpful and construc- 
tive so far as the work of the first four grades is concerned.

  CHAPTER II 
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN TEACHING 
THE preceding chapter has set forth the problem which 
every primary teacher faces in her arithmetic teaching, 
and has suggested that a solution of the problem lies in 
the direction of more economical methods of teaching. 
.The purpose of this chapter is to summarize a few of the 
more important principles to guide us in our efforts to 
save time and energy and at the same time to improve 
results. It may seem at first sight that the principles 
which are to follow are too commonplace to be mentioned 
in a book which expects to make a contribution to our 
technique of teaching. Such is not the case, however, 
because the actual evidence shows conclusively that quite 
the contrary is true. This evidence will be presented 
from time to time throughout the book. 
I. Surr tHe Amount or Dritt To THE DIFFICULTY OF 
THE TASK 
This is one of our oldest pedagogical precepts. Teach- 
ers and supervisors for generations past have granted 
its truth and have tried to apply it in their practice. The 
handicap which has always beset them is the fact that 
the actual amounts of difficulty have not been known 
in detail. It has been assumed that the particular num- 
ber facts are all equally difficult for the child. Not until 
1915, when Holloway ! published his study of the relative 
difficulty of the fundamental combinations, was there

any adequate realization of the great difference in diffi« 
culty which exists between learning that 2 and 2 are 4 
and learning that 9 and 7 are 16. Further details con- 
cerning these differences are given in Chapter VI, Here 
we shall have to content ourselves with saying that our 
present practice material is almost the exact reverse of 
what it should be so far as Principle I is concerned.1_ Sup- 
plementary practice material to remedy this situation is 
indispensable if we hope to improve our results as they 
should and can be improved. 
II. Tracu First anp Most Compretety THAT Wuicn\ 
1s Most Usep In Lire 
This is another principle, the truth of which is self- 
evident; yet apparently not until 1919, when Wilson 
published his survey,” was any attention given to finding 
out what arithmetic is actually needed outside of the 
schoolroom. An effort has since been made to eliminate 
from our textbooks much of the material which is rela- 
tively useless socially, but the process is yet far from 
complete. It is still true that the people are paying taxes 
to support schools in which essential facts are poorly 
taught and in which non-essentials are taught reasonably 
‘ well. Surely busy teachers can ill afford to continue 
such a policy. In Chapter III this matter is considered 
in detail together with suggestions for improvement.

in the spelling book. The teacher never’ thought of 
making an effort to find out whether or not some in the 
class already knew how to spell every word in the lesson, 
yet such was often the case. Similar procedure is still 
to be found in most of our schools both in spelling and 
in arithmetic. Pupils are continually being required 
to study that which they already know. On the other 
hand, pupils are failing to get the answers to their prob- 
lems even in the high school, because they fail to respond 
correctly to a few fundamental number facts. The 
author recently found a boy in the demonstration school 
of a State normal school who was failing to get his answers 
correctly because he said that 8 times 7 are 63 every 
time he met it in his work. How much discouragement 
and how much lack of self-confidence on the part of the 
pupil would be removed if we could teach only what the 
child needs instead of wasting our time and his in drilling 
him upon what he already knows. This principle will be 
considered more in detail in Chapter IV. 
IV. Donot Try To TEAcH Wuat THE CuItD CouLp Not 
LEARN EVEN WITH THE Brest TEACHER IN THE WORLD 
A large number of teachers are afflicted with one or 
two pupils who simply cannot learn. Strenuous efforts 
on the part of the teacher may bring forth the correct 
response to a new word or number fact for to-day; but 
when to-morrow comes the child has forgotten every- 
thing which he had seemingly learned the day before. 
Such children appeal to our sympathies and some of them 
have even learned how to act so as to heighten this appeal. 
Thus it happens that some of our best teachers spend 
most of their precious nerve energy on the pupil who 
cannot profit by it. They are trying to teach something 
which the child cannot remember even if he were taught
-P-A-G-E-17
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN TEACHING 7 
by the best teacher whom the sun ever shone upon — 
while the rest of the children in the room are being robbed 
of their share of the teacher’s time and attention. Many 
of these latter children are having their troubles also. 
Some of them are trying to divide when they cannot sub- 
tract, or multiply when they cannot add. A little judi- 
cious help from the teacher would do them a great amount 
of permanent good. The fundamental contention here 
is-that the teacher should distribute her attention in 
accordance with two guiding principles instead of one. 
She must try to help all who need help, but in addition 
to this she must attend first to those who need help and 
who can profit by it. To overlook the latter principle is 
to make a serious mistake; because unless this precept 
is observed, it will inevitably follow that the most neg- 
lected pupil in the school will be the most brilliant one. 
This question will be considered further in Chapter V. . , 
V. Atways Do Your Brest To Make Pupits WANT TO 
Learn WuHAtT THEey SHOULD LEARN 
Do not try to teach pupils when they are tired, bored, 
or sleepy. A full discussion of this principle will be given 
in Chapters VIII and IX. Here it will be possible to 
indicate in a brief manner only some of the annoyances 
and distractions which the teacher must remove from her 
pupils if she is to avoid wasting her strength. It must 
be confessed, however, at the outset that entirely too little 
is known concerning the nature and operation of the 
things which annoy children and distract their attention 
from their work. On the other hand, some well-known 
facts are often overlooked. Most teachers know that 
children must be comfortable and contented if they are 
to learn. Surely every teacher has heard somewhere 
that the temperature must be suitable in all parts of the 
‘
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
room; that the seats must be comfortable; that un- 
necessary confusion should be avoided; and that the 
health and physical condition of the children should be 
looked after. All of these things should be considered, 
yet it is certain that some of them are ignored in most 
of our schools. 
The author recently visited a school where facts such 
as those mentioned above had been singularly disregarded. 
As the door of the room was opened, the visitor was met 
with an outpouring of hot, foul air reeking with sickening 
odors. The thermometer stood at eighty degrees. Upon 
investigation it was found that the fresh-air intake had 
been carefully closed. Some of the children were sitting in 
seats too high for them, with their feet dangling above 
the floor. Others were enduring similar torture in seats 
which were too low. There were no shades to shut out 
the glaring light. No attention had been paid to the 
physical condition of the pupils. For all that the teacher 
knew, many of the pupils may have been suffering from 
poor eyesight or hearing, malnutrition, decayed teeth, 
bad tonsils, or adenoids. Indeed, the gaping mouths 
of two or three pupils made the last condition almost a 
foregone conclusion. Some of the children must have 
had headache. Their faces were flushed and red and 
an uncontrollable drowsiness pervaded the whole room. 
In spite of all this, the teacher seemed earnest and con- 
scientious; and the school was situated in a rather en- 
lightened community. 
While the author does not wish to imply that conditions 
are as bad as this in many schools, he is firmly of the 
opinion that one or more elements of this situation are 
present in the vast majority of them. Certainly no 
industrial concern could operate with profit under such 
viclation of the laws of economy and common sense.
-P-A-G-E-19
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMY IN TEACHING 9 
Schools are expensive and teaching is hard work at best. 
Surely better conditions are at hand, and it is to be most 
sincerely hoped that within the lifetime of those now 
living we as a nation shall be able to look back upon this 
age of waste and extravagance of effort and marvel at 
our own stupidity.

  CHAPTER III 
RELATIVE VALUE OF SUBJECT-MATTER 
Any one who takes time to sum up all that a child is sup- 
posed to know about the fundamentals of arithmetic at 
the end of his fourth yeai in school will be struck with 
the magnitude of his task and will obtain an illuminating 
notion as to why our results are as poor as they are. 
CoMBINATIONS TO BE LEARNED 
Let us look at the task somewhat in detail. There 
are 100 combinations each in addition, subtraction, and 
multiplication. In order to do column addition accurately 
up to and including all cases where g is to be carried, the 
child must know more than 700 additional facts! In 
order to master short division, the child must know 450 
facts ? including the 90 cases where there are no remain- 
ders and the 360 cases in which remainders occur. 
In long division, if one thinks only of the examples 
in which there are two digits in the divisor and two in 
the quotient, one finds that there are 8100 such exercises. 
It should be borne in mind that all of this takes no account 
of the work often done in these grades in common frac- 
tions and denominate numbers nor of the work in reason- 
ing problems which is always done. 
The following is a summary of what we expect of the 
child. 
1 These are the cases in which a number less than 10 is added mentally to 10 
or toa number greater than 10. These are called high-decade additions. For 
samples see Appendix, pp. 163 to 165. :

Tue INADEQUACY OF TRANSFER 
The real magnitude of this undertaking has been largely 
obscured by a’ pedagogical doctrine which we have 
thoughtlessly followed for generations. This doctrine 
is known as the “ transfer of training.” According to it, 
if a child is taught a combination in direct form, he will 
always know it in reverse form. If he learns it in the 
simple form, he will always know it in every form. For 
example, if a child is taught how much 8 and 2 are, it is 
assumed that he will always respond correctly to 2 and 8, 
18 and 2, 28 and 2, 12 and 8, 22 and 8, and so on. In 
like manner a child who is taught that 8 from’ 13 equals 
5 is expected to respond correctly to 8 from 23, 8 from 33, 
5 from 13, 45 from 53, and so on. Lastly, a child who is 
taught how much 7 times 8 are is supposed to respond 
correctly to 8 times 7, 56 divided by 7, 62 divided by 8, 
and the like. Thus we have been encouraged to believe 
that all our work is done when we have taught 180 facts — 
the 45 so-called “ principal combinations ” in addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division. Just how this 
marvelous transfer is to take place completely from 180 
combinations to the 1680 has never been explained. Yet 
teachers still go about their work with the simple faith 
that the expected will infallibly take place. 
On the other hand, we have long known that the scheme 
fe » »

  12 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
did not work. Parents and business men have complained 
for more than a century that the results of our teaching 
in arithmetic are inadequate. Little improvement re- 
sulted, however, until our teachers, textbook writers, 
and educators began to break away from the time-hon- 
ored “armchair philosophy ” which they had so long 
followed. Instead of theorizing about how the teaching 
should be done, we find that since 1900 they have been 
making an honest effort to analyze what actually happens 
under the old plan and to study means of improving it 
through the use of modern scientific method. {In 1903, in 
/his Educational Psychology, Thorndike launched his first 
/ attack against the general theory of transfer of training 
| | 
ay et or formal discipline as it was then called; Bagley follow- 
ing with his Educative Process in 1905. The work of 
these men has since been verified by many other investi- 
ators. The substance of their conclusions is as follows: 
(Transfer is real in many situations, but is never per- 
fect. (eYIt can take place only when there is either 
identity of elements, identity of procedure, or identity 
\ of ideals, - 
There is, indeed, a partial identity of elements in the 
additions 5 and 8 and 15 and 8. There is also partial 
identity of procedure and there may be identity of ideals, 
such as pride in the correct answer, pertinacity, and the 
like. But the identity is never complete, and from this 
fact it necessarily follows that the transfer is also incom- 
plete. This means that the old methods of teaching the 
fundamentals of arithmetic were bound to be faulty —a 
conclusion which is abundantly supported by’ the un- 
satisfactory character of the results which we have been 
getting. 
Thus we find ourselves facing the task: of teaching 
thildren to master 1680 number facts with methods which
-P-A-G-E-23
  RELATIVE VALUE OF SUBJECT-MATTER 13 
have proved to be inadequate. In seeking help in such 
a situation there are two principles which can guide us. 
They have been mentioned in Chapter II, but they are 
hoes ma e for emphasis: (1) (Teach first that which 
mast used ) rw should be most used in life outside of scho 
osu the‘ amount of drill to the‘ difficulty of the ist) 
ow, what facts in the fundamentals of arithmetic are 
i! most use in life outside of school? It seems incredible 
that so little attention has been given to this question. 
The first contribution to it so far as the writer knows was 
made by Wilson less than ten years ago. He found that 
the amount of arithmetic which people use is astonishingly 
small. Indeed, so little is used that some writers believe 
this is not an adequate criterion of what should be taught. 
Some competent people think it would be better to teach 
all the people might use with profit in the transaction of 
their business. Yet, even if we adopt the latter criterion, 
the amount of arithmetic fundamentals which should 
be thoroughly mastered is relatively small. From this 
point of view the writer proposes the following number 
facts as far too important in life outside of school to be 
neglected or left to be acquired through the limited possi- 
bilities of transfer. 
CoMBINATIONS IN ADDITION 
It is assumed that everybody will need the ability to 
add, subtract, multiply, and divide accurately, at least 
within certain limits. As to addition, every person should 
be able to add any number less than ten to any other 
number of the same sort. In other words, he should be 
able to add every possible combination of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, and g taken two at a time. This includes these

combinations in both direct and reverse form. For ex- 
ample, the addition of, 2 and 7 is to be taught just as 
carefully as 7 and 2. (i It is also necessary to teach care- 
fully all combinations involving zero. Children do not 
inherit the ability to add zero and 6 or 8 and zero. The 
failure to teach the zero combinations is responsible for 
a large share of the error in the fundamentals of arith- 
metic even in high-school classes. The total number of 
these addition facts is 100. 
Cotumn ADDITION 
A perfect knowledge of these 1oo addition facts will 
enable a pupil to make every possible combination of any 
one number less than ro with any other number less than 
ro. This knowledge is extremely important, but obvi- 
ously it does not include all of the information which 
is needed in addition. Every one occasionally meets a 
situation in which he needs to add more than two num- 
bers together. This process is usually called “ column 
addition.” A need for it arises most frequently in con- 
nection with the purchase of a bill of goods when it is 
required to find the total amount spent. Such a need 
is exemplified in the following situation :

Pupils are usually taught to begin at the lower right- 
hand corner. Let us suppose they have learned the 100 | 
facts mentioned above, among them the fact that 8 and 6
-P-A-G-E-25
    RELATIVE VALUE OF SUBJECT-MATTER 15 
are 14. The next step, however, is new. The child must 
now think 14, and add a written 7 to the 14 which is in the 
mind. Having obtained 21, the child must now think 21 
and add 8 to it. In like manner the process is continued 
until the top of the column is reached. The final sum 
for the right-hand column is 42. The child must then 
write the 2 in the units’ place and add 4 to the 9 at the 
bottom of the second column from the right. (Addition 
upward is assumed.) Four and 9 are 13 is one of the 100 
facts already learned, but the addition of the remainder 
of, the tens’ column requires the mastery of additional 
facts. 
Heicut or CoLtumns 
The process is just the same for each succeeding col-" 
umn as one goes from right to left in column addition. 
The new facts needed in column addition are evidently 
the higher decade combinations. As already stated, there 
are more than 7oo of these; and any of them may be 
needed if the columns are high enough to give sums 
up to 100. In other words, the number of higher-decade 
additions which a child will use depends upon the height 
of the columns which he is expected to add accurately. 
How tall should these columns be? No answer has ever 
been agreed upon so far as the author is aware. The 
result is that some teachers are asking their pupils to add 
columns which extend from the bottom of their tablets 
to the top, while other teachers are giving little attention 
to any column addition. 
Small practical need for tall columns. It is evident 
that some more definite standards should be set if the 
principles of economy of teaching are to receive considera- 
tion. In attempting to arrive at a standard, two or three 
facts should be considered which tend to lessen the em-  
-P-A-G-E-26
16 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
phasis to be placed on the adding of extremely tall columns. 
In the first place, there is little practical need for the 
addition of tall columns outside of banks and similar 
places of business. Almost invariably, however, these 
institutions own adding machines and have no need for 
employees who can add such columns “ by hand.” 
In the second place, even though such addition is . 
necessary in a few small grocery stores, meat markets, 
and the like, it must be remembered that one always 
starts the column, however tall it may be, with the lower 
decades. One must add through the tens, twenties, and 
thirties in order to reach the fifties, sixties, and seventies. 
It follows, then, that additions in the lower decades are 
used much more frequently. 
The attention span as related to height of columns. 
In the third place, there is a limit to the number of figures 
which a person can add in a column without a pause. 
This is because each person has what is known as an 
“attention span.” There is a limit to the amount of 
time which any of us can spend thinking closely about 
any one thing. There is also a limit to the number of 
things which we can see at a glance or remember when 
heard as a group. It is probable that the average child 
cannot add more than six or eight figures without a pause. 
If a child attempts to add more than this, his attention 
wanders for a moment from the task in spite of himself. « 
It is true that he can bring himself back to the work after 
a short pause, but by this time he may have forgotten 
the partial sum which he was holding in his mind and he 
may have forgotten just how far he had gone in his pro- 
cess of adding up the column. In either case an error is 
inevitable. This means that the difficulty of correct .

_addition increases enormously as the column increases 
in height. It would be better, therefore, to break the 
extremely long column into two or three, add each one 
separdtely, and then add the two or three separate sums. 
/The most important combinations. For all of these 
reasons it seems advisable to set a limit to the height 
of the columns which we assign for addition. The 
author suggests that we teach first, and as thoroughly 
as possible, the addition of columns in which no column 
adds up to more than 39. If longer columns are consid- 
ered at all, they should either be broken in two or left 
for spare time, if there is any, in the upper grades. To 
assign addition exercises which are nine figures high and 
three or four figures across is useless and even cruel. 
If we make up our minds, then, to limit our efforts to 
the teaching of that which is most useful in column addi- 
tion, the task is very much shortened. Instead of having 
more than 700 combinations in high-decade addition we 
shall now have only 255. Thirty of these, however, are of 
the form 16 and zero, 29 and zero, and the like. These 
cover all the cases in column addition up to sums of 39 in 
which zeros may occur in the column. Now zeros are 
not of importance in column addition and the child should 
be taught merely to neglect them. After these 30 are 
deducted, 225 of the total 255 remain to be taught. 
Since these 225 are already partly known, it seems cer- 
tain that, with a small amount of attention closely cen- 
tered upon the most useful and most difficult of them, 
we shall be able to solve the old and troublesome question 
of how to get accurate results in column addition.

/ This is the addition which occurs in multiplication. Sup- 
/ pose one needs to multiply 98 by 7, for example. The 
98 problem is usually written in the form In order 
to obtain the right answer some addition is necessary. 
The child must think 7 times 9 are 63 and must remember 
that he has 5 to carry. Here we have a situation where 
it is necessary to add two numbers both of which are in the 
mind only. They are never written. Now, 63 and 5 
is one of the higher-decade additions mentioned on page 
11, but it is not included in the minimum given on page 17, 
since 63 is greater than 39. It follows, then, that some of 
the combinations in the upper decades are much more 
important than others. For example, 63 and 5 is of great 
practical value, but 67 and 5 is not. This is because 63 
is one of the products in the multiplication table while 67 
is not. If one takes the trouble to list all possible addi- 
tions which can ever occur in multiplication situations like 
the one given above, one finds that there are 175 of them. 
Eighty-eight of these occur also in the group needed for 
the addition columns whose sums are 39 or less. It fol- 
lows, therefore, that only 87 combinations are needed in 
addition to the 225 mentioned on page 17. The 88 are 
needed both in multiplication and in the most useful col- 
umn addition. It is recommended, therefore, that these 
be reviewed again in connection with the 87 new ones. 
No teacher can expect high accuracy in carrying in mul- 
tiplication unless she has carefully and conscientiously 
taught each one of these 175 addition combinations.! 
CoMBINATIONS IN SUBTRACTION 
In subtraction two sorts of situations need careful 
attention. They are the 100 combinations as ordinarily 
1See Appendix, pp. 165 to 166 for list of these 175 combinations.

given in the subtraction table and the 175 subtraction 
combinations which are needed in short division. To 
neglect either of these groups is to insure poor results in 
accuracy. The first group is usually taught carefully, 
but the second is universally neglected even in our best 
textbooks. When children meet the situation 8)712, they 
must subtract 64 (held in mind) from 71. But no previ- 
ous practice has been given in this sort of thing. The 
only clue that even the bright child has is his knowledge 
that 4 from 11 leaves 7. Now, the question is what 
does 64 from 71 leave —a que@tion which is considerably 
different. Is it any wonder that children make mistakes? 
To attempt to teach the mastery of short division under 
such conditions is rank stupidity. Let’s give the child 
a chance. Teach him the 175 combinations. 
CoMBINATIONS IN MULTIPLICATION 
In multiplication there are 100 combinations which 
must be thoroughly mastered. As in addition, it is poor 
policy to teach only 45 piston It is equally as 
bad to fail to teach the zerO combinations. It is not at 
all unusual to find a high-school pupil failing to get the 
correct result in an algebra exercise because he responds 
“8” to the situation 8 times zero. 
CoMBINATIONS IN DIVISION 
In division the requirements are more extended. If 
the child is to be expected to do accurately all possible 
forms in short division, he must have the mastery of 450 
facts. He may be called upon to make any of the follow- 
ing divisions : ?

The total number of possible divisions with 1 as a divi-.

and so on up to 9, which occurs as a divisor 90 times. 
Thus the grand total for all possible facts in short division 
is 450. Ninety of these are the facts which are ordinarily 
taught. They are the total number of cases in short divi- 
sion in which there are no remainders. It has been 
customary until very recently to expect the child to 
attain a mastery of the 360 cases in which remainders 
occur without help from the teacher. Every teacher 
knows that this is impossibleyparticularly in the 45 cases 
in which a child is called up@fto divide a number into 
something less than itself. The following is an illustra- 
tion : 
34. 
6)1824 The correct answer, of course, is 304. The child has erred 
in failing to think “ 6 into 2 goes zero times.” Failure to 
teach needed facts is the cause of this most prevalent error. 
In general, it may be said that satisfactory accuracy 
in short division is not to be expected until all of the 
pupils have had at least some practice on each of the 
possible 450 combinations. 
The summary on page 11 showed a total of 1680 com- 
binations, which a child might need. The following

No teacher in grades four to eight can consider her 
work well done until she has made an inventory of the 
amount of mastery of these combinations attained by 
each of her pupils. 
We have seen how a consideration of use outside of 
school has reduced the number of facts to be taught from 
1680 to 1237. The second principle, quoted on page 13, 
enables us to go one step farther. It tells us to suit the 
amount of drill to the difficulty of the task. If perchance 
any teacher becomes so busy that she cannot possibly 
teach all of the 1237 facts, she should teach the ones that 
are most difficult, hoping that the child, in some way or 
other, will learn the easy ones himself. Which ones of the 
1237 facts are the most difficult?

made, however, and one point is well established. The 
exercises which involve bridging are generally more diffi- 
cult than those which do not.! 
Bridging means either adding or subtracting from one 
decade into another one — usually an adjacent one. All 
the integers less than 10 constitute the first decade; all 
those from 10 to 19 inclusive constitute the second decade. 
All of the twenties make up the third decade; all of the 
thirties the fourth, etc. If one subtracts, for example, 
8 from 13 and obtains the answer 5, one passes from the 
second decade into the first. If one subtracts 8 from 
53, one passes from the sixth decade into the first. Like- 
wise in addition, if one adds 7 to 16 and gets 23, he passes 
from the second decade into the third. All such cases 
involve what is called “ bridging.” A great deal of our 
adding and subtraction is done, of course, within the 
same decade. Thus, 6 and 13, 18 minus 15, 35 and 4, 
48 minus 45, and the like do not involve bridging. 
« Itis worth while, therefore, to know which of the 1237 
combinations involve bridging. The following is a sum- 
mary of them. 
Among the too simple addition combinations, the 45 
whose sums are between 10 and 18 inclusive involve 
bridging. Among the 225 higher-decade additions, there 
are go combinations of this sort. Of the 87 higher-dec- 
ade additions which occur in multiplication and which 
do not occur in the 225 mentioned above, 26 involve 
bridging. Among the roo subtraction combinations the 
45 whose minuends are 1o or more are of this class. Of 
the 175 additional subtraction combinations involved in

Multiplication and division. Two further facts con- 
cerning relative difficulties are quite well established. 
Of the 1oo simple multiplication combinations, those 
whose products are more than 25 are more difficult, gen- 
erally speaking, than those whose products are 25 or less. 
In like manner, in short division those with dividends 
larger than 25 are more difficult than those whose divi- 
dends are 25 or less. Of the former there are 32 which 
are more difficult. Of the latter 112 are more difficult.t 
This total is 144. These, combined with the 266 in ad- 
dition and subtraction, yield 410 combinations which 
are very useful and rather difficult. Constant drill upon 
these combinations ‘will be needed even in the eighth 
grade. To neglect this means certain failure to attain 
the desired degree of accuracy. 
THe CoMBINATIONS IN VARIOUS SETTINGS 
The foregoing represents a minimum requirement for 
the number of facts to be taught in the fundamentals of 
arithmetic. To teach these and stop, however, would 
not be sufficient. School children will also need the help 
of the teacher in the application and use of these facts. 
_ Some of these applications are so useful to people in gen- 
eral as to merit special mention here. The teacher will

need to pay particular attention to carrying in addition, 
borrowing in subtraction, compound multiplication, and 
long division. All of these are so well known that ex- 
planation of their nature is not needed. It may be worth 
while, however, to say that “ compound multiplication ” 
is a term used to include all cases in multiplication where 
there is more than one figure in the multiplier. 
The minimum amount which should be taught con- 
cerning these applications has already been described in 
part. It is summarized here in a more complete form 
and in the order of importance. It has been suggested 
that column addition should be limited very largely to 
columns whose sum is 39 or less. This means that the 
child must learn accurately and carefully how to carry 
one, two, and three —and this is also the order of 
importance in carrying. It is much more important for 
a child to be able to add and carry one correctly than 
for him to be able to carry two, three, or more with 
accuracy. This is true because most of the column addi- 
tion which people use involves the carrying of one rather 
than that of more than one. Teach the children first 
the mastery of exercises where one is carried. When 
these are mastered, teach exercises where two and then 
three are carried. Then review all three frequently. 
In subtraction we never borrow more than one and 
this borrowing is done only in connection with the 45 
subtraction combinations mentioned on page 23. Teach 
each of these 45 particular cases very carefully. 
In compound multiplication it is recommended that 
children be taught the mastery first of such exercises as 
have two figures in the multiplier and two in the mul- 
tiplicand. When this type of exercise is mastered, take 
up exercises that have two figures in the multiplier and 
three, four, five, etc., in the multiplicand. Then pro-

a 
ceed to exercises in which there are more than two figures 
in both multiplier and multiplicand. ? 
In long division a similar order is advisable. Teach 
first a mastery of the exercises in which there are two 
figures in the divisor and one in the quotient. Include 
answers with remainders also. Then proceed to exer- 
cises with two figures in the quotient, then to those with 
three in the quotient. After the pupil becomes proficient 
in all these exercises and not before, start him upon 
examples which have three figures in the divisor and one 
in the quotient, then upon those with two, three, etc. 
in the quotient keeping a three-figure divisor. This 
process may be continued as long as time permits, but 
it is not advisable to use examples which involve products 
or dividends which are extremely large. The question 
of how to deal with the applications of the fundamental 
number facts will be considered further in Chapter VII. 
{ In concluding this chapter we may summarize by 
saying that we should teach first and most carefully that 
which is most useful and that which is most difficult. 
We should stick to each of the essentials until the child 
masters it. This is the best way to secure economy of 
time and effort in the long run.

CHAPTER IV 
THE NEEDS OF THE PUPILS 
In the preceding chapter much was said concerning what 
the child needs to learn in the fundamentals of arithmetic. 
Two principles were enunciated which serve as guides 
to the needs of all children. First, (teach, that which is 
Gh used or should be most used in 2) and, second, 
  
      suit the amount of drill to the difficulty of the task.) In 
this chapter I propose to consider the needs of pupils 
in a more individual and detailed manner. Such specific 
_ information has been entirely lacking until very recent 
years. The sum total of human knowledge in print con- 
cerning detailed needs in the fundamentals of arithmetic 
is indicated by the references in the footnotes of this 
chapter. The meagerness of our information has been 
due in the main to two causes. It has been felt that the 
difficulties of small groups of pupils are not worth con- 
sidering and that such difficulties are distributed en- 
tirely by chance. 
MinvTi# 1n TEACHING 
It is quite certain that these two assumptions are 
responsible for the hopeless “ doldrums ”’ into which we 
have fallen in recent years in our efforts to improve results 
in arithmetic. Big and striking things naturally attract 
attention. Furthermore, it is necessary to deal first with 
general principles and with material which is capable of 
wide application. [It is unwise to devote much attention 
to the five or ten per cent of pupils who have special needs 
when the ninety or ninety-five per cent are not properly 
cared for.\) We now have a voluminous literature dealing 
26
-P-A-G-E-37
    
THE NEEDS OF THE PUPILS 27 
with the method of teaching the fundamentals of arith- 
metic to the average child, and perhaps even to ninety 
per cent of the children. The large elements have re- 
ceived attention in the past. But the hope of improve- 
ment now lies in the consideration of smaller elements. 
A slight increase in the efficiency of a machine may change 
failure into success. The removal of a very small amount 
of friction may increase efficiency enormously. It has 
been a mistake to overlook the minutie of learning and 
teaching, just as it would be a mistake to overlook the 
minutie which contribute to the success or failure of an 
automobile. There is a very great difference between 
almost getting through the mudhole and actually getting 
through when we are driving our cars; yet the actual 
-difference in the motive power may be very slight, in- 
deed. In teaching, the matter of minutiz is even more 
important. 
Suppose a teacher has a class of thirty pupils, and 
suppose that all of the pupils are doing well save one. At 
first sight it may seem that the failure of the one is a 
matter of small consequence. The truth, however, is. 
often quite the contrary. Our best teachers are usually 
conscientious, and many of them often devote more 
effort and nerve energy to the one slow pupil than they 
do to all of the remaining twenty-nine put together. 
Meanwhile the twenty-nine are often compelled to mark 
time until the one slow pupil catches up, if he ever does. 
They learn laziness and idleness, not arithmetic. Thus 
the efficiency which at first sight seems extremely high 
may degenerate into something little better than mockery. 
A Srupy or Errors 
Evidence showing the futility of the assumption that 
individual needs are distributed according to chance will  
-P-A-G-E-38
28 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
be presented later on in this chapter. The method of 
approach used in collecting this evidence was the study 
of the individual errors of 3600 children. This also 
proved an effective means of dealing with the small group 
of retarded pupils whose presence often plays such havoc 
with the actual results obtained by the teacher. In bas- 
ing suggestions for the improvement of instruction upon 
error studies, it is assumed that success frequently re- 
sults from the study of failures. Industrial concerns find 
it profitable to study the situations in which their output 
falls short of the expected amount. Few salesmen talk 
about the weak points of what they sell, but it is safe 
to assume that all good salesmen have a pretty definite 
knowledge of what those weak points are. Teachers, 
however, are almost always destitute of such information. 
There is an abundant literature and a host of correlation 
coefficients based upon the correct responses of the child, 
but no one knows the correlations which exist among the 
annoyances, distractions, and disturbances to which both 
children and teachers are subject. 
Previous Error STUDIES 
Wherein do children err and why? Our knowledge is 
far from complete, but enough is known to merit a pres- 
entation here. Most studies of errors have been based 
upon some standard test. Theisen in The Janesville 
Survey* describes an error study based on the Woody 
Tests in Arithmetic. C. J. Anderson had previously 
made a study of errors in division based on the same 
test.2 Uhl has also done similar work in column ad-

‘dition based on the Courtis Practice Tests.1 Counts 
made a much more complete study in 1917 based upon 
the Cleveland Survey Tests.? These investigators proved 
one thing of great significance. They showed that many 
errors are not of the chance type and made it appear 
doubtful if any of them are. 
The most complete study of errors which has yet been 
made was carried on in Wisconsin in 1920-21 under the 
direction of the author. This study would have been 
utterly impossible had it not been for the hearty codpera- 
tion of Wisconsin school superintendents, supervisors, 
and. teachers. These busy people spent hours of their 
time in the tedious and laborious process of listing the 
wrong answers obtained by their pupils on the Woody- 
Theisen Parallel Tests in Arithmetic.’ Copies of this 
survey were sent out in mimeograph form in December, 
1921. The following is a summary of the findings: 
Including duplications, 21,548 wrong answers were 
reported, of which 6107 were in addition, 6459 in sub- 
traction, 4551 in multiplication, and 4431 in division. 
The number of children involved ranged from 3044 in 
division to 3943 in addition. The schools represented 
were in various parts of the State and in varied environ- 
ments. Much of the data obtained relates to material 
beyond the scope of this book. Only that portion of the 
report which relates to the fundamental processes is given 
in detail here. The remainder is briefly summarized.

All errors are included even when made by pupils who 
were unquestionably beyond their depth. This was done 
on the theory that what a child does when he meets a 
new situation is the same as what he does when he meets 
“one that he has totally forgotten.

Addition. The following are some of the more im- 
portant details in addition. Sixteen children in grade 
three and 9 in grade four got an answer of go to the prob- 
lem . because they did not know the combination 9 
and zero. Twenty-four children in grade three, 27 in 
grade four, 23 in grade five, and 14 in grade six got an 
answer of 4 to the problem 4 ++ 1=_ because they did 
not know the meaning of the plus sign. Sixteen children 
in grade three got an answer of 15 to the problem 47+ 22 = 
(They said 4 and 7 and 2 and 2 equal 15.) On five prob- 
lems in column addition the children in grade three gave 
roo wrong answers; those in grade four gave 82; and 
those in grade five gave 12. The total number of children 
tested was 597 in grade three, 674 in grade four, 703 in

number of children tested was 467 in grade three; 642 
in grade four; and 637 in grade five. The source of 
trouble in nearly every case was reacting to zero in the 
multiplier and multiplicand as though it were 1. In 
the last exercise the pupils multiplied by the first figure 
of the multiplier and added the other two.

of children tested was 597 in grade four; 641 in grade

causes of the trouble were ignorance of division com- 
binations, lack of acquaintance with the division sign, 
and trouble with zeros in the quotient. 
Type ERRors 
The foregoing data have been presented in detail be- 
cause they prove conclusively that there are very definite 
and very persistent type errors. When children in school 
systems scattered over a whole State get the same wrong 
answer to the same problems, it is idle to speak of these 
errors as chance errors. The per cents of type errors in 
the addition of integers in grades three, four, and five 
was 17, 15, and 4 respectively. In subtraction the cor- 
responding per cents were 45, 25, and 9; and in multi- 
plication they were 24, 13, and 3. In division the per 
cents of type errors in grades four, five, and six were 23, 
14, and 4 respectively.
-P-A-G-E-43
THE NEEDS OF THE PUPILS 33 
The remainder of the errors were of such a nature that 
their cause could not be ascertained from the test papers 
alone. Further investigation since the time of this sur- 
vey indicates that they are due in large measure to a 
varied combination of the same causes which produced 
the errors described in detail above. Even if such were 
not the case, the fact remains that by removing four or 
five causes, from 3 to 45 per cent of all the errors would 
be removed. For children who make these type errors 
we can guarantee the amount of improvement which will 
result when the causes of the errors are removed. The 
question of how to remove the causes will be considered 
in Chapter VI. 
The per cent of type errors would have been much larger 
if another sort of test had been used in the survey. The 
Woody tests aimed to present only one or two exercises 
representing each type of difficulty. Some of these were 
presented in such a form that it was impossible to ascertain 
the cause of the error. This was not so much the case 
in subtraction, and as a result the total per cent in that 
operation was much higher. Evidently, before the final 
word is spoken concerning the nature and frequency of 
type errors, a great deal more work will have to be done. 
An Error Stupy in Lone Division 
One type of procedure designed to give a more accurate 
notion of the individual and specific needs of pupils is 
given below. The data were collected in an effort to 
ascertain the nature and distribution of the errors which 
children make in long division. The following test was 
used : 
To the pupil: This ladder has easy problems at the bottom 
and more difficult ones at the top. How far can you climb om

15. 4388 + 51 
16. 1808 + 42 
17. 5600 + 70 
These exercises are constructed in such a manner that 
it is fairly easy to tell what caused the wrong answers. 
The test was given to 500 children in rural schools and in 
two cities. The total number of errors was 716. The 
errors were found to be grouped as follows: 
Per CENT 
Errors in estimating the quotient . . .. . 39 
Errors in multiplication combinations . . . . 22 
Errors in subtraction combinations . . 21 
Errors in carrying, borrowing, copying, bringing 
down, and failure to complete the exercise. . 19 
An inspection of these per cents leaves little doubt as to 
the character of the needs of these particular children. 
Nearly half of their trouble lies in multiplication and 
subtraction rather than in division — indeed, more than 
half of it if carrying and borrowing are included. Now, 
multiplication and subtraction are presumed to be pre- 
requisite to long division; yet here we find teachers try-
-P-A-G-E-45
Ee eT oe ae “22

THE NEEDS-OF THE PUPILS 35 
ing to teach children to divide when at least half of the 
difficulty lies in what precedes division. 
Type Errors ARE WIDESPREAD AND CONSTANT 
Having reached this point in our study of errors, it 
seemed advisable to stop and devote our attention to a 
means of removing the errors whose nature and extent 
were already known rather than to spend more time in 
the search for further types. When our remedial pro- 
gram has been completed up to this point, we hope to be 
able to devote further time to a study of additional causes. 
One thing is encouraging. A comparison of error studies 
shows that type errors are remarkably widespread and 
constant. Theisen, in his study of the errors made by 
fifty children at Janesville, found nearly all of the type 
errors which were found later in the responses of more 
than three thousand children scattered over the entire 
State of Wisconsin. Similar results have been obtained 
in several studies which have since been carried on in 
local areas. Now, a study of the errors made by a thou- 
sand or more children can be carried on only with the 
codperation of many people. On the other hand, a 
study of the errors of fifty or a hundred children can easily 
be made by one person. The fact that such a study 
reveals typical errors gives much significance to the work 
of individual investigators who are dealing with small 
groups. Progress, therefore, should be easy in the future. 
CouNTING ON THE FINGERS 
Two more facts remain to be mentioned concerning 
the needs of children in the fundamentals of arithmetic, 
as revealed by the foregoing studies. The first relates 
to a peculiarity of the errors of children in simple ad- 
dition, Lists were made out of the wrong responses
-P-A-G-E-46
36 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
which children gave to such combinations as 9 and 6. 
From this it appears that most children make the correct 
response. Of those who err, a large number will respond 
14 and about an equally large number will say 16. Two 
other equal but smaller groups will respond either 13 or 
17. This is undoubtedly very largely due to counting 
with the fingers, tongue, or some other portion of the 
body. It is one of the chief arguments against permitting 
children to indulge in such a practice. To some extent 
the same thing is discernable in the other processes, 
INTERFERENCE IN LEARNING 
fire second fact is that of interference. Large numbers 
of ‘children substitute something which they have pre- 
viously learned for the thing which is required of them. 
Those who are asked to add will multiply; those who 
are asked to divide will subtract. This is one of the 
worst of all errors, and it seems to grow worse as the child 
progresses from grade to grade.) It would not seem to 
be difficult for any one to learn that 2 times 3 is 6, yet 
children continually give 5 for an answer, because they 
have learned 2 plus 3 so well. In like manner there 
is a very marked tendency to respond “ zero” to any 
number divided by itself. Another common type of 
interference is the confusion of one multiplication com- 
bination with another. Thus we find 3 X 2 = 3, 
4X4= 27, 7X2=16, 6X 7=35. In fact, the 
wrong response is nearly always some other product of 
the multiplication table. 
InFoRMAL REPORTS ON ERRors 
Just as the constant and general nature of errors tends 
to lend weight to the results of individual investigators, 
so the reports of teachers are worthy of considerable
-P-A-G-E-47
THE NEEDS OF THE PUPILS 37 
attention even when they have not made a formal sur- 
vey. The following errors are reported by teachers often 
enough to insure for them a place in this chapter: 
(rz) Failure to put zeros in the quotient when necessary, 
as in 7)2863. The wrong answer is 49. 
(2) Errors arising when children are required to add a 
number between 5 and ro to one less than 5. For ex- 
ample, 2+ 8 is more difficult than 8+ 2. This seems 
partly due to the habit of counting on the fingers or tap- 
ping. In 8+ 2 the child needs to tap only twice, which 
is easy; but in the case of 2 + 8 the child has to tap eight 
times and the chances for error are much increased. 
(3) In higher-decade addition, when the next number 
in the column is the same as the digit in units place in 
the preceding sum. For example, in the exercise 
27 
45 
78 
34   
suppose the child begins adding at the bottom of the units 
column. When he gets up to the number 7, he should 
have17inmind. The addition of such numbers as 17 and 
7, 26 and 6, 38 and 8, etc., seems rather difficult. This is 
probably due to too much expectation of transfer. The 
children have been taught 7 and 7, 6 and 6, and 8 and 8, 
and have found these combinations rather easy because 
they are reénforced by some things learned in multipli- 
cation. Such is not the case, however, in the correspond- 
ing higher-decade additions.

which is very pronounced. The existence of chance 
errors is doubtful.

  CHAPTER V 
HOW THE TEACHER CAN DISCOVER THE » 
NEEDS OF PUPILS 
Tue title of this chapter assumes that teachers both can 
and should discover the causes which are operating to 
retard the progress of their pupils. The truth of this 
assumption is usually acknowledged in theory, but it very 
frequently fails to carry over into actual practice. Be- 
cause of this, the teacher is seldom considered to be an 
expert by the general public. We often hear of expert 
mechanics, expert physicians, and expert lawyers; but 
little is said outside of pedagogical books and articles 
concerning expert teachers. An essential characteristic * 
of an expert is his ability to diagnose difficulties better 
than ordinary people can. Thus the expert mechanic 
must know how to tell what is wrong with a machine 
that will not work. An expert physician must be able 
to tell what is the matter with people who are ill. And 
an expert lawyer must be able to point out the weak 
points in his opponent’s argument. In like manner, 
expert teachers must be capable of making an educational 
diagnosis of pupils who are not succeeding in their school 
work as well as they should. The teacher must know 
better than any one else how to discover the nature and 
causes of the disabilities under which pupils labor. 
The past century has seen a development and appli’ 
cation of the principles of scientific method to an extent 
unheard of before. Advancement in scientific research 
has made possible the great inventions which have so 
recently transformed our mode of life. A similar advancé 
40
-P-A-G-E-51
  HOW TO DISCOVER NEEDS OF PUPILS 41 
has also been made along professional lines. Together 
with the growing multiplicity and complexity of our ways 
of doing things, has come of necessity a multiplicity and 
complexity of technical knowledge and skill. Much of 
this knowledge is available in books, but the place to 
learn how to apply it effectively is in the presence of 
actual situations. The machinist has become an expert 
by an extended experience in making and repairing com- 
plex machines; the surgeon by the actual performance 
of intricate surgical operations; and the physician by 
continual practice with people who are ill. Thus the 
growth of modern thought has made necessary more and 
more specialized forms of expert science. 
Tue NeEp ror Expert EpucaTionat D1acnosis 
The teaching profession has also felt the impulse of “ 
this movement. The growth of technical information 
relating to methods of teaching had developed to such 
a point seventy-five years ago that it was found necessary 
to provide normal schools for the professional training 
of ‘teachers. These institutions have done a valuable 
and extensive work, but their influence is not yet what 
it should be. In many respects they have lagged behind 
other institutions which give professional training. This - 
is particularly true in their failure to equip their students 
with a mastery of scientific methods or even with a scien- 
tific attitude of mind. If an automobile fails to work, 
one can find a man in any country garage who can usually 
make a satisfactory scientific diagnosis of the difficulty 
and a reasonably good prescription of the treatment nec- 
essary. In like manner, if a person becomes ill, one can 
usually find a physician who can make a diagnosis and 
prescribe a remedy in accord with scientific procedure. 
But how is it when Mary and Johnnie fail to make their  
-P-A-G-E-52
42 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
grade in school? Most teachers, indeed, will offer a 
diagnosis. They tell us that Mary is restless and giddy 
and refuses to think about what she is doing; that John- 
nie is indifferent and bad and so disgustingly careless and 
slovenly in his work. This is diagnosis of a sort, but it 
certainly is not scientific and it is quite likely to be faulty. 
Any school patron could do as well. Hence we as teach- 
ers have not yet been able to convince the public that 
we are experts i in our business. 
The main cause of the trouble lies in our ignorance of “ 
the disabilities and weaknesses which beset our pupils. 
We have not gone about our work in a scientific manner. * 
The machinist can tell the general disabilities to which 
machines are subject and he judges from the behavior of 
a machine which particular disability is present. The 
doctor, in like manner, looks us over, observes our behav- 
ior, and then from his general knowledge of diseases iden- 
tifies the thing which is afflicting us. There was a time 
when doctors did not have sufficient knowledge of dis- 
eases to identify any particular one. Then they met the 
situation by saying that some evil spirit had gotten into 
the patient, just as teachers often say that Mary and 
Johnnie are possessed by the spirit of laziness, stubborn- 
ness, or plain meanness. Doctors, however, have learned 
that diseases are caused, not by spirits, but by certain 
definite and specific conditions. They have learned 
that there are many diseases. They have identified 
these diseases and have given them names. They have 
learned that the behavior of the patient is the key to his 
disease. They know that specific diseases require spe- 
cific treatment, and no longer try to cure typhoid fever and 
rheumatism by hocus-pocus or incantation. 
Teachers, too, must learn how to identify the educa- 
tional diseases which afflict pupils. Many of these dis-
-P-A-G-E-53
    HOW TO DISCOVER NEEDS OF PUPILS 43 
abilities are so vague as yet that we have no names for 
them. We do know, however, that they are specific. 
Mere efforts to make the work interesting or to compel 
the child to study will not remove them any more than 
charms and amulets will cure scarlet fever. We are 
beginning to learn, too, that the behavior of the pupil 
affords the symptom of his educational disability just 
as fever, cold feet, and a peculiar-looking throat are 
symptoms of influenza. = 
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth certain types 
of pupil behavior which are symptomatic of some of the 
most widespread educational disabilities, with the hope 
that the teacher on the job may be able to use them 
profitably in the educational diagnosis of her pupils. 
Two Types or Epucationat DIsABILITIES 
V ‘here are two general types of disabilities, one that 
must be outgrown if it is ever removed, and the other 
oa may be_remov ith c arative ease when its 
0 The former is the result 
a a lack of mental ability on the part ofthe child, while 
. the latter is due to poor teaching, poor health, and the 
like. It is evidently of great importance for the teacher 
to have some means of discovering which type is respon- 
_ sible for the child’s shortcomings. If the former type 
of disability is present, the teacher is not to blame; if 
the latter, she and her predecessors are at least partially 
at fault. 
How can the teacher tell whether or not a lack of mental 
ability is the cause of the pupil’s failure? , 
The use of an intelligence test is the best help. “Con- 
sider the grade which the child is in and the average age 
gf the pupils who are generally found in that grade, 
Syppose you are dealing with a child in the fifth grade,  
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  44 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
for example. Fifth-grade children should be from ten 
to eleven years of age. But suppose this pupil responds 
to an intelligence test just about like a seven-year-old 
child should respond. This means that your fifth-grade 
child has the mental age of a seven-year-old child regard- 
less of how old he may be. Such a pupil would have 
only second-grade ability, and it would be a mistake to 
try to teach fifth-grade subject-matter to him. Efforts 
to do so, if vigorously carried out, would tend to subject 
the child to overstrain. The teacher is not to blame 
under such circumstances when the child fails. On 
the other hand, she is to blame if she robs the other pupils 
of attention and tries to get one or two children through 
when they haven’t the ability to do the work even under 
the best teacher that ever lived. 
It is a mistake, however, to rely upon one intelligence 
test alone. Some children are so timid and nervous that 
they cannot do themselves justice on one such test. 
There are a few children, too, who may receive low scores 
on an intelligence test when they are in reality good in 
arithmetic. Thus a pupil may have more than fifth- 
grade ability in arithmetic and still get a low score on an 
.intelligence test because he has almost no ability in any- 
thing but arithmetic. In other words, the exercise of 
common sense and the use of other data than those 
derived from intelligence-testing are essential. 
While the use of an intelligence test is advisable, there 
are many cases when it will be impossible because of the 
expense involved or because the teacher does not know 
how to give such tests. Under these circumstances, the 
following “symptom” is worth remembering. If you 
find a child in grade three or above who simply cannot 
xemember the arithmetic combinations —if he always 
forgets by to-morrow what you teach him to-day — the &

chances are that you are dealing with a pupil who is lack- 
ing in mental ability. In that event, give the pupil his 
share only of your time, but do not neglect the other pupils 
on his account. - 
Moines further should ike said in this connection. 
First, if a child is mentally incapable of doing what is 
j expected of him now, do not assume that he never will 
’ be able to meet the requirements. Some babies say da-da . 
before others do; but none of them does so until he is 
fully ready. In ‘ike manner, the children who cannot 
possibly do fifth-grade work this year may do it well next 
year. Mental growth is rapid in some and slow in others. 
With a few individuals it may be slow for a long period and 
then it may take place rapidly. When the baby refuses to 
say da-da, sensible parents merely wait until he is ready. 
Teachers and parents must often do likewise with the 
slow child who cannot learn long division or fractions. 
‘Second, some children are capable of doing the work 
in the grade in which they are placed, but they learn so 
slowly that the teacher, in justice to the other pupils, 
cannot afford to take the time required to teach them 
thoroughly. The only thing for the teacher to do in 
such a case is to tell the child’s parents very clearly how. 
matters stand and recommend that they employ a tutor 
for him. If they fail to do so, do the best you can for 
the child; but do not rob the other children of their share 
of your attention. Do not try to teach that which the 
children cannot learn even with the best of teachers, and 
do not teach slow pupils at the expense of other pupils 
who can profit more from your attention. 
Symptoms or DISABILITIES IN ARITHMETIC 
The second type of disabilities is due in large measure 
(to he e environment and experience or lack of experiences

which the child has had. \The best approach to a diag= 
nosis of these abilities is through the observation of types 
of behavior which are symptomatic. In the case of arith- 
metic, the teacher will need to know what the child does 
and how he thinks when confronted by a problem. It 
is often possible to discover disabilities by merely ex- 
amining the wrong answer which the child gets to his 
problem. Some of these significant errors have already 
been noted in Chapter III, together with a list of the most 
common disabilities. Additional samples are given here 
as a further aid to a teacher who is a beginner in educa- 
tional diagnosis.

The trouble occurs in connection with 2 and 4, 5 and 1, 
and 2 and 7 respectively. It is possible that the child 
does not know these combinations. Other possibilities 
are that he multiplied instead of adding in the first case, 
and that he confused the plus and multiplication signs in 
the second. In the third he may have attempted to add 
by tapping. After making the seven taps, he may have 
written “7” instead of “9.” The second group of 
possibilities are the more probable.

In the first, the error is in the tens column, and there 
are three possibilities; mistakes in combinations, having 
carried x instead of 2, having written 3 instead of 4 after 
obtaining 34 as the sum of the tens column. The first 
and third of these are the more probable. In the second 
example, the error lies either in the combinations or in a 
failure to see the number at the top of the units column. 
The odds are about even between the two. In the third 
example, the trouble undoubtedly lies with the combina- 
tions. In number four, the error may be due to mistakes 
in combinations or in failure to carry. The latter is the 
more probable. In example five, the trouble is due either 
to combinations or to having carried 4 instead of 1. The 
former is the more probable. 
In number six, the child either made a mistake in the 
combinations or carried 1 when there was nothing to 
carry. The latter is the more probable.

In the first example, the child neglected the numerators, 
added the denominators, and wrote the result as an in- 
teger. In the second, an error was made in adding the 
numerators after each fraction had been reduced to a 
common denominator. In the third, the child multiplied. 
Tn the fourth, he added the numerators for a new numera- 
tor and the denominators for a new denominator. In 
the fifth, he added the numerators for a new numerator 
and multiplied the denominators for a new denominator. 
In the sixth, the last process was reversed.

error.

In the first case, the child added as though he were 
working with abstract units. Having obtained 16, he 
wrote down the 6 and carried the 1. In the second case, 
no effort was made to reduce the answer to proper terms. 
These two types cover nearly all of the errors found in the 
addition-of denominate numbers. Sometimes they are 
mixed with errors due to a lack of knowledge of the addi- 
tion combinations, and in rare cases we find that trouble 
with the addition combinations is the sole cause of the 
error.

Each of these shows an ignorance of subtraction com- 
binations, though number ten may be due to a lack of 
acquaintance with the minus sign. In both addition and 
subtraction, when children miss a combination they miss 
the answer by just one unit more often than they make 
any other error. This is shown in numbers three and 
four. It seems to be due to counting on the fingers. 
Numbers six and seven are samples of the very common 
trouble which children have with zero combinations. In 
number seven the child does not feel that he has sub- 
tracted unless his answer is less than what he started with. 
Number eight shows a rather frequent trouble that chil- 
dren have in subtracting a number from itself. In num- 
bers six and nine the error may be due to the substitution 
of another process for subtraction.

Numbers one and two are very common in the lower 
grades and are found in all grades. The error in number 
one may be due to a failure to “ pay back ” what is bor- 
rowed, or it may result from something like the following 
line of thought: ‘ She wants me to take 5 from zero. I 
don’t know how to do it, but we learned not long ago 
that zero from 5 leaves 5.” This reversing of digits in the 
subtrahend and minuend is very common. In number 
two the child probably thinks: ‘“ If you start with zero 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
and take 5 from it, you certainly would still have zero. You 
can’t get anything by taking something from nothing.” 
In number three the child feels that he cannot take g 
from 1, so he uses 9 times 1. Number four shows a sure 
case of reversion. Nine from 7 is responded to as 7 from 9 
should be. Number five is either a case of reversion or a 
failure to “pay back” what is borrowed. The odds 
favor the former. Number six might be addition, but 
much oftener it is reversion. Number seven is a case 
of failure to “ pay back ” what was borrowed. Number 
eight is a case of “ you can’t take something from nothing 
and get anything.” Number nine is a case of “ paying 
back twice”? what was borrowed. Number ten is an 
example of where the child “ pays back ” when nothing 
has been borrowed.

A small amount of inspection shows what was done in 
each of the five cases above. In number one, the de- 
nominators were added while the numerators were sub- 
tracted. In number two, the fractional portion of the 
subtrahend was brought down. Numerators and de- 
nominators were both subtracted in number three. Num- 
ber four is an illustration of numerators subtracted from 
corresponding denominators, In number five the nu- 
merators were multiplied.

The wrong answers shown in numbers one, two, and 
nine are most likely due to ignorance of combinations. 
The pupils probably responded “8 times 8 are 63,” “6 
times 7 are 56,” “7 times 9 are 72,” respectively. In 
number four, the possible errors are 4 times 7 are 48, or 
4 times 8 are 34, or 32 and 2 are 36. One cannot tell 
with certainty from an inspection of the answer. In 
number five, the error is probably 4 times 8 are 4o with 
failure to carry. In number six, the child said 4 times 
   
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
o are 4, and brought down the remainder of the multipli- 
cand. In number seven, the figure 7 is omitted from the 
multiplicand. In number eight, the child either said 9 
times 7 are 62 or 63 and 8 are 70. The odds favor 
the latter. In number ten, the pupil used the zero of the 
multiplier as though it were a 1. 
Compound multiplication. All the errors of simple 
multiplication are likely to occur also in compound mul- 
tiplication. Thus, in

In number one, the answer is written backwards. In 
number two, there is an error in division in reducing the 
answer. In number three, the child confuses the multi- 
plication sign with that of addition, while in number eight,

HOW TO DISCOVER NEEDS OF PUPILS 53 
he adds the numerators and adds the denominators. In 
numbers four and five, the child merely brings down 
the fractions. In number six, the pupils found 4 of 8 to 
be 4. In number seven, the answer is inverted. In 
number nine, the child divided. 
Multiplication of decimals. All the errors of simple and

number four, the child failed to write zero in the quotient 
in response to “ 6 into 4.”

as errors in multiplication and subtraction when the 
latter are taken together.

two shows a failure to carry where the child multiplies 
25 by 9. Number three shows an error in subtracting 
225 from 240. Numbers four and five exemplify failure 
to deal with situations where the quotient ends with a 
zero followed by a fraction. Number six shows another 
case of zero trouble.

Nearly all of the errors are connected with inversion.

two, he inverted both divisor and dividend; and in num-

Errors found in the division of whole numbers play a 
considerable part. Almost all of the new errors are of the 
two kinds above shown. In the first case, the child thinks 
he must put the point in the quotient just above where it 
is in the dividend. In the second case, he thinks he must 
point off as many places in the quotient as there are in 
the divisor and dividend taken together. 
How To D1Acnose Errors IN REASONING PROBLEMS 
- The most frequent trouble in this connection is the 
ilure on the part of the child to know what process to use. 
He looks at his teachers and asks artlessly, ‘Do you 
subtract?” On examination or test day the teacher, 
of course, does not answer. Under such circumstances 
* the child acts like any normal but ignorant person would. 
He thinks: “She wants me to do something. I don’t 
know what it is, but I’ll take a chance at it anyway.” 
There are four fundamental processes, and the child has 
one chance in four in one-step problems of getting the 
correct answer by mere guess. He will guess wrong, 
however, about three times out of four. Thus, in the 
problem, ‘‘ We learn to spell two new words a day in our 
school. How many new words do we learn in eight days?” 
We find by far the largest number of wrong answers to be 
zo, 6, and 4. These represent the wrong guesses. The
-P-A-G-E-66
    6 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
children add, subtract, or divide because they are un- 
lucky. It follows, of course, that some of the children 
who get the right answer have guessed luckily. In prob- 
lems of two or three steps the same thing occurs, but it 
is not so easily detected. 
The first thing to do in trying to account for wrong 
answers to reasoning problems is to find every possible 
way to “juggle” the figures. In more than five cases 
out of ten you will find in your list the wrong answer ob- 
tained by the child. 
Another large group of errors arise from the fact that 
the child misreads or misunderstands some portion of 
the problem. Consider the following problems?: 
(x) A boy had 210 marbles. He lost one third of them. How 
many had he left? Pupil’s answer, 70. 
(2) A coat cost ten times as much as a hat. Both together cost 
$66.00. How much did the coat cost? 
Pupil’s answer, $6.60. 
(3) Find the total cost of the following purchases : 
83 yards of flannel at 96¢, 44 yards of braid at 16¢, 12 yards 
of embroidery at 223¢, 10 yards of lace at 273¢ 
Pupil’s answer, $1.62. 
(4) What is the product of 6 and 8? Pupil’s answer, 14. 
In the first problem, es pupil fails to read what is re- 
quired. He assumes that‘he is to find how many marbles 
were Jost. In the second problem, he leaves the cost of 
the hat entirely out of consideration. In the third, he 
fails to understand that the prices quoted are prices per 
yard. In the fourth, he does not know the meaning of 
the word product. He adds, just to be doing some- 
thing. 
A third type of error arises from an ignorance of fun- 
damental relations, such as those of income and outgo, 
1 Problems (1) and (3) are taken from the Buckingham Problem Test.
-P-A-G-E-67
HOW TO DISCOVER NEEDS’ OF PUPILS 57 
profit and loss, velocity and time, and the like. For 
example : 
(x) I wish to buy a house and lot. I find a place that rents for 
$720.00 a year. The taxes and up-keep amount to $240.00 
per year. How much can I afford to pay for the house and 
lot if I wish to clear 6 % per year on my investment ? 
Pupil’s answer, $16,000. 
(2) The distance from New York to Chicago is 980 miles. A 
train starts from Chicago toward New York, running at the 
rate of 40 miles per hour. How long will it take the train 
to reach New York? Pupil’s answer, 39,200 hours. 
In the first case, the pupil adds the amount spent on 
the property to the amount received from it. In the 
second, he multiplies the distance by the rate to find the 
time. 
In addition to the errors just given and their symp- 
toms, any teacher who investigates the matter will find 
errors in the children’s work which are due to mistakes 
in the fundamental processes. These should be diag- 
nosed as suggested on pp. 46 to 55. 
It will be noticed that in many cases the disability 
cannot be surely identified by the mere inspection of the 
children’s work. In some instances two or three possibil- 
ities have been given. This means that upon a first 
inspection we may be unable to decide which of two or 
three things is the matter, just as the physician is some- 
times uncertain as to whether we have the influenza or 
merely a bad cold. In both cases further diagnosis is 
necessary and possible. In all matters of doubt the 
teacher should request the pupil to do his adding, mul- 
tiplying, and the like aloud. 
This takes very little time and is very much worth while 
because it is almost sure to yield the true diagnosis. It 
1 See Uhl, of. cit., p. 29.
-P-A-G-E-68
58 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
is recommended that the teacher attempt first to account 
for failure on the part of the child by the inspection of his 
wrong answers. If doubt still remains, be sure to have 
him do the work aloud. Having thus gotten a correct 
notion of the true nature of the child’s difficulty, it is 
usually easy to remove it. 
EpUCATIONAL INVENTORIES 
The business man often makes an inventory in order 
that he may carry on his business more effectively. In 
like manner the teacher will frequently need to make 
educational inventories. Such instruments are given 
in the Appendix. On pages 155-78 are the things 
which every child needs to know. The teacher’s task 
is to find out just how many of the required things each 
child knows and just what and how many he does not 
know. In obtaining this information the procedure is 
as follows, taking the 100 addition combinations on 
pages 155-56 as an example. Ask the pupils to write 
the numbers from 1 to 100 on their tablets, leaving a 
space at the right of each column. Read aloud the first 
combination in this manner: ‘How much is 2 and zero? 
Write what you think it is just after the number 1 on 
your tablet.” See that all get it in the right space. Then 
say: “I am going to read some more combinations to 
you. Please write the answers after 2, 3, 4, etc. I am 
going to read them rapidly. You will have to hurry to 
keep up. If you do not know the answer, skip the space 
and go to the next number.” Read the combinations, 
then, “2 and 6,” “3 and zero,” and soon. When a child 
does not know a combination well, or when he has to 
count on his fingers, he often spends too much time on it. 
Often he finally gets it right, but in the mean time he has 
forgotten what the next combination is. In checking
-P-A-G-E-69
  HOW TO DISCOVER NEEDS OF PUPILS 59 
papers it is well to remember, therefore, that a blank often 
represents trouble with the correct answer just preceding 
it. 
In order to help some children to get back on the track 
after they have been “lost,” it is well to say, “ Number 
ten (or whatever the number is) is 5 and zero.” Then 
proceed as before. Both teacher and pupil will need 
preliminary practice before the final try-out is made. 
The pupil will need practice to enable him to skip cor- 
rectly when he does not know the combination. The 
teacher will need practice to enable her to read the com- 
binations regularly and at the correct rate of speed. A 
reasonable time between the readings is:

These limits should be gradually shortened if the test is 
used as a practice exercise. The final limit is the speed 
with which the children can write the answers. It goes 
without saying that the teacher should give no further 
‘help after the children understand what is to be done. 
All of the combinations given on pages 155-72 can 
be tested out in this way. In this manner the teacher 
and pupil can learn just what each pupil already knows 
and just what remains to be learned. Be sure that each 
child keeps a record of the combinations which he misses. 
A final word seems necessary to meet the objection 
which is sometimes raised against giving tests to children 
under time pressure. It is said that children get nervous 
and excited and cannot do themselves justice. The an-
-P-A-G-E-70
  60, CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC By 
awer is, that we do not careif they do. In actual life situa- 
tions we do our adding, multiplying, and the like when 
we are thinking of something else. We cannot afford 
to have to stop and think how much g and 6 are or how to 
spell our names. These things must be done accurately 
and almost umconsciously. Our task as teachers is to 
teach these combinations so well that the pupils will 
respond correctly even when they are scared or excited. 
So far as the strain is concerned, the test does not last 
long enough really to injure even the most excitable 
pupil. One of the best things we can teach our pupils 
is the power to concentrate their attention, marshal their 
forces, and settle down to accurate, concentrated work 
for short periods. Instead of harming pupils, it helps 
them and they enjoy it. Every practical teacher knows 
this. 
SUMMARY 
Suggestions have been made as tolocating the pupils who 
are so poorly equipped mentally that it isn’t worth while 
to devote time or effort to teaching them in public schools. 
Lists have also been given of the “ symptoms ”’ of special 
disabilities in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division, and in reasoning problems. This part of the 
chapter is to be used mainly as reference in connection 
with individual case studies. Finally, a method has 
been outlined for using as inventory instruments the lists 
given in the Appendix. ba

In seeking for needful types of practice material, there 
are four guiding principles. First, additional practice 
_should be provided _in that which is inherently more 
difficult for children to learn. )The practice eater 
should, therefore, be arranged in the proper order so that 
each element ‘can be practiced when it is most needed. 
Second, additional practice should be provided for those 
elements in which the pupils are weak. \ Third, practice 
material ‘should be provided to take care of situations in” 
which needful material does not now exist in printed form. -) 
We cannot afford to hold children responsible for some= 
thing that they have never hada chance tolearn. Fourth, 
thst which is-necded should be taught directly “To expect useful habits in arithmetic to be formed merely 
by transfer is not in accord with scientific principles and 
is sure to result in waste and disappointment. 
Inherent difficulties. These principles will be con- 
sidered in the order indicated above. The question of 
inherent relative difficulty has already been discussed in 
Chapter III. The facts brought out there are sum- 
marized here for convenience. 
or

In simple addition the combinations whose sum is more 
than 10 are relatively more difficult except those in which 
a number is added to itself, such as 9 and 9, 8 and 8, and 
the like. In the latter cases the difficulty varies almost 
exactly with the size of the numbers. 
Large numbers added to small numbers are usually more 
difficult than the reverse. Thus, 3 and 9 is more difficult 
than 9 and 3. In higher-decade addition, bridging gen- 
erally involves additional difficulty. In subtraction, 
multiplication, and division much the same situation 
is found. The larger the numbers involved, the more 
difficult the combinations. One important exception 
to this rule occurs in division where it is required 
to divide a number by itself. For some children these 
combinations seem the most difficult of all. At least 
they are responsible for most of the errors. These facts 
are well established even when the pupils have had an 
equal amount of practice beforehand. 
Elements in which pupils are weak. In the study of 
errors described in Chapter IV, it was impossible to know 
‘how much previous practice the children had received. 
The results, however, were largely in accord with the 
facts given above. One outstanding condition, however, 
developed. The zero combinations proved very trouble- 
some. This was particularly true in subtraction, mul- 
tiplication, and division.

The trouble with zeros raised the question as to whether 
or not sufficient practice material is provided for use in 
_ schools. In order to answer this question, the author 
checked through one set of the Courtis Practice Cards, 
one set of the Studebaker Practice Exercises, and Book I

    TYPES OF PRACTICE MATERIAL 63 
of one of the leading textbooks on the market. The 
results were uniformly the same. Accordingly, the data of 
Table I, obtained from the textbook, may be considered 
typical. The averages refer to the average number of 
times. a child was called upon to use each of the com- 
binations. Under the caption “ Range of Practice” I 
have listed the smallest and the largest number of times any 
combination occurs. All of the problems were worked out 
and a record was made of every combination used. Thus 
in a problem in long division, a record was made of the 
division, addition, subtraction, and multiplication involved. 
Assumptions. In order to make this count, certain 
agsumptions were necessary. They are as follows: 
was assumed that all addition is.made from the 
ottom of the column upward. When carrying is 
involved, it was assumed that the amount carried was to 
be added in at the beginning of the next column. 
multiplication where carrying is involved it was assumed 
that the amount carried was added as a higher-decade 
addition. For example, in the case o 5 it was as- 
sumed that the addition involved is 25 and 1 rather than 
the reverse. (4) In the case of “ borrowing,” it was as- 
sumed that the one which was borrowed was added to 
the next figure in the subtrahend. (5) In case addition 
was presented in the equation form, it was assumed that 
the direction of addition was from left to right unless it 
was necessary to recopy the numbers. In the latter case 
it was assumed that the first number on the left was 
written at the top of the column. (6) The simple divi- 
sion facts which the child uses in estimating the quotient 
in long division were counted even though the first es- 
timate might be wrong. For example, in the exercise 
49)1274 a count was given to 12 + 4.

An inspection of the averages and ranges given above 
raises some interesting practical questions. How many 
times should a child have used the fundamental com-
-P-A-G-E-75
TYPES OF PRACTICE MATERIAL 65 
binations by the time he is promoted into grade five? 
By common consent it is assumed that the fundamentals 
should be so well mastered by that time that the emphasis 
thereafter may be placed almost entirely on their ap- 
plication in the various situations in which they have 
proved useful in human experience. 
Amount of practice needed. How much practice should 
a child have in order to insure this required mastery? 
This very important question has been almost entirely 
overlooked by previous writers on the subject. Thorn- 
dike, in lieu of anything better, hazards an assumption 
as to the answer. He says: 
“ For one of the easier bonds, most facilitated by other bonds 
(such as 2 X 5 = 10, or 10 — 2 = 8, or the double bond 
7 = two 3’s and 1 remainder) in the case of the median or 
average pupil, twelve practices in the week of first learning, 
supported by twenty-five practices during the two months 
following, and maintained by thirty practices well spread over 
the later periods should be enough . . . For bonds of or- 
dinary difficulty, with average facilitation from other bonds 
(such as 11 — 3, 4 X 7, or 48 + 8 = 6) in the case of the 
median or average pupil, we may estimate twenty practices in 
the week of first learning, supported by thirty and maintained 
by fifty practices well spread over the later periods. . . . For 
bonds of greater difficulty, less facilitated by other bonds (such 
as 17—9,8X7,.. .), the practice may be from ten to a 
hundred per cent more than the above.” 
Thus the total amount of required practice is estimated 
at 67, 100, and 110 to 200, according to the inherent 
difficulty of the combination. If this estimate is a rea- 
sonable one, it is up to teachers and supervisors to see 
that this amount of practice material is provided for the 
1237 combinations which a child must master.? If we 
1 Thorndike, The Psychology of Arithmetic, p. 133. 2 See pages 155 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
66 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
give 150 practices to the 185 hardest combinations and 
67 to the remainder of the 1237, the total number of 
practices would be something less than 100,000. This 
is somewhere near the number contained in the ordinary 
three-book series extending through eight grades. In 
other words, the present textbooks contain only about 
three fourths of what they should contain if Thorndike’s 
estimate is to be met by the end of the sixth grade. 
Range of practice. A more serious problem presents 
itself when one looks at the ranges of practice as shown 
in Table I. In addition ° occurs five times, while : 
occurs 335 times. 
In subtraction 7 occurs eight times, while : occurs 
293 times. 
In multiplication @, occurs eleven times, while : oc- 
curs 323 times. 
In division 81 +- 9 occurs four times, while 4 + 2 is found 
133 times. In division with remainders and in higher 
decade addition a total of 95 combinations do not occur 
at all; and the maximum is always far below the mini- 
mum requirement, according to Thorndike’s estimate. To 
make matters worse, if possible, there is a general tend- 
ency to give the least practice to what is inherently the 
most difficult and the most practice to what is easiest. 
Under circumstances such as these it is certainly out of 
the question to expect to get better accuracy than we have 
been getting. In fact, it seems remarkable that the 
children do as well as they do. Our teachers are doing 
well when we consider the crude tools with which they 
work.
-P-A-G-E-77
TYPES OF PRACTICE MATERIAL 67 
Tue NEED FOR SUPPLEMENTARY PRACTICE 
MATERIAL 
The problem before us is quite clearly that of pro- 
viding better and more adequate practice material. This 
does not necessarily mean that the textbooks should all 
be rewritten. It may even be impossible to write one 
that would apportion the amount of drill to the inherent 
difficulty of the task. Furthermore, it is not certain 
that it would be advisable to use such a book even if it 
could be written. A textbook of this sort would be very 
likely to violate one pedagogical principle in seeking to 
observe another. (Difficult combinations must have ade- 
quate practice, but this practice should not, as a rule, be 
given when other difficulties are present) When children 
are being introduced to new topics, such as short division 
with remainders, long division, or fractions, the new 
element should be introduced in connection with com- 
binations which are inherently as easy as possible) The 
observance of this principle necessitates a large amount 
of over drill upon easy combinations, but the benefit de- 
rived is worth the cost. 
For another reason also, it would be unwise to throw 
overboard or radically charige the textbooks which we 
now have. The estimate given by Thorndike is in terms 
of averages only. But that which suits the average child 
is usually extremely out of place for the child who is far 
above or far below the average. 
For both of these reasons it seems best to use the text- 
books somewhat as they are and get at the problem 
through supplementary practice material in card form. 
Much practice material is now available in this form, 
but all of it has unfortunately been based upon the theory 
of transfer. The relative amount of practice is almost 
   
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  68 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
identical with that of the textbooks. The same com- 
binations are overdrilled in both and the same important 
combinations are entirely omitted in both. 
Both supplementary and textbook practice materials 
are also open to one further objection. \Both fail to afford 
certain essential practice material when it is needed. ) This 
is true both in single combinations and in groups of com- 
binations. In one widely used textbook the child meets 
o plus 8 for the first time on page 112. The combination 
8 plus 5 occurs only three times in the first 191 pages. 
In subtraction no drill is provided for the combinations 
used in short division before short division is introduced. 
In column addition the child must add small numbers 
to large ones without any preliminary practice. In carry- 
ing in multiplication the conditions are the same. In 
multiplication, 1 times x occurs for the second time on 
page 183, and 8 times 3 occurs for the third time on page 
112. In short division almost no practice is afforded in 
the use of 1 as a divisor, and the amount of drill is in- 
adequate for cases where a number is to be divided into 
itself. All of these combinations occur frequently in 
compound multiplication and in long division. Some 
of the difficulty of these latter processes is due to insuffi- 
cient preliminary practice upon the combinations in- 
volved. Trouble with zero in the quotient is notoriously 
common because little or no practice is afforded where 
the divisor is greater than the dividend. 
Wuat TO Do IN Lone Division 
Long division is troublesome because too many diffi- 
culties are presented at once. A study of the errors which 
children make in long division shows that the centers of 
trouble lie (1) in getting acquainted with the new form, 
(2) in carrying, (3) in borrowing, and (4) in estimating  
-P-A-G-E-79
  TYPES OF PRACTICE MATERIAL 69 
the quotient including the use of zeros ¥ These difficulties 
should be introduced one at a time. “The worst difficulty 
is that of estimating the quotient. It would seem reason- 
. able, therefore, to postpone the consideration of all prob- 
lems where the estimated quotient is likely to be wrong 
until all of the other difficulties are mastered. Some of 
the textbooks have made an effort to do this, yet one of 
the most widely used books introduces the child to long 
division through the problem 15)240. This exercise in- 
volves carrying, borrowing, a zero combination and trouble 
in estimating the quotient in addition to a new form of 
operation. There is no excuse for such a thing as this. 
There are 8100 problems in long division which involve 
two figures in the divisor and two figures in the quotient. 
Three hundred of these contain no major difficulty other 
than the new form of operation. One thousand others 
are equally easy with the exception of the zero combina- 
tions which they contain. Twelve hundred contain 
carrying as the only major difficulty, and more than four 
hundred involve borrowing as the only major trouble. 
More than half of the 8100 exercises afford no trouble in 
estimating the quotient for children who have had a 
reasonable amount of the right kind of practice in short 
division. The general rule for teaching long division 
should be: Present the examples in such order that one new 
difficulty and only one is presented at a time. No child 
should be called upon to solve a problem involving all of the 
difficulties until he has mastered exercises involving each 
one separately. Groups of examples arranged coe 
to difficulty are given on pages 173 ff. 
The best way to obviate the defects of the present prac- 
tice material is to provide a set of practice cards which 
will afford drill upon that which is needed when it is 
needed. These cards should supply drill directly upon
-P-A-G-E-80
70 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
those combinations which are missing or of infrequent 
occurrence in the textbooks. With cards of this sort 
the teacher who makes an effort to diagnose the errors 
of individual children will be able to correct individual 
weaknesses by the mere manipulation of the practice 
cards. The cards can be constructed so that each child 
may know just why he failed to get a correct answer to 
any particular example. The pupil will be made aware 
of just how much he knows and just how much remains 
for him to learn. The cards should stress certain individ- 
ual combinations which particular pupils miss. Special 
drill should be afforded in the higher-decade addition 
combinations listed on pages 163-65, and upon the sub- 
traction involved in short division shown on pages 167-69. 
Additional drill should also be provided on examples 
which have zeros in the quotient. Lastly, plenty of 
practice should be afforded in long division in accordance 
with established principles of teaching relative to order 
of presentation. 
SUMMARY 
The principles governing practice have not been ob- 
served by those who have published our most widely used 
practice material. Combinations which are inherently 
difficult receive relatively less practice. The existence 
of type errors has been largely overlooked. Our present 
practice material is unsatisfactory both in amount and 
character. A large number of combinations in higher 
decade addition and in division with remainders do not 
occur at all, while many others are practiced so few times 
that they might as well have been omitted entirely. On 
the other hand, some easy combinations are overlearned 
beyond all reason. In some instances where a fair amount 
of practice is provided, the bulk of it comes too late to be

of value. Prerequisites occur for the first time along with 
the things for which they are prerequisite. This is par- 
ticularly true in multiplication and division.

textbooks alone. Suitable practice material in loose-leaf 
or card form is essential, if we are to provide adequately

CHAPTER VII 
WHAT TO TEACH IN EACH GRADE 
Tue Work ror GRADE ONE 
In the first grade the main task is to give the’ pupils a 
mastery of reading.» For this reason it does\not seem 
advisable to require formal work of any sort in arithmetic. 
This does not mean, however, that no number work is 
to be taught during the first school year. As a matter 
of fact, the first year is a very important period. Children 
who are learning to read words can easily learn to read 
numbers also. The reading of numbers comes most 
naturally in connection with the page numbers in the 
primers and readers. Children at this age like to count, 
and there are numerous situations in which a need for 
counting arises. 
Tue NEED FoR OBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE 
One general rule applies to the number work of the 
first grade. It should always be taught in connection 
with objects. No doubt this is the manner in which 
numbers first came into use by the human race. Rous- 
seau: tells us that all of the child’s learning should come 
in that way. Froebel believed that a child’s education 
consisted in his realization of or reliving the experience 
of the race. This doctrine breaks down when applied 
generally. In the case of arithmetic, however, there is 
abundant reason for allowing little children to proceed 
much as the race did in the discovery of numbers. The 
children are naturally interested in such questions as: 
How many fingers and toes have you? How many pupils 
72
-P-A-G-E-83
  
  WHAT TO TEACH IN EACH GRADE 73 
are in this room? How many pages have we read? 
How much money have you? When such situations 
arise, the teacher has a real opportunity to teach the 
children to count. Most children should be able to 
count to one hundred before they reach the second grade. 
Teach also the counting by tens and fives from 10 to 100 
and 5 to 100 respectively. : 
In their reading the children will be very likely to 
meet the numbers in the form “ three,” “ five,” etc. On 
the pages of their books these numbers will appear as 
“3” and “5.” On clocks and watches they often 
appear in the forms “III” and “V.” Teachers should 
make a special effort to see that children can recognize 
the smaller numbers in these three forms. The word 
forms should be learned only as they occur in the child’s 
reading. The Roman numerals should be known up to 
XII as a basis for telling time by the clock. The ‘Arabic 
numerals should be known up to roo. 
Number work arises very naturally in connection with 
common units of measure, such as pints, quarts, inches, 
feet, yards, pounds, and the several coins in common use. 
Teachers should give particular attention to the teaching 
of numbers in cases where the number element is some- 
what obscure. Little children are naturally perplexéd 
when they are told that one small silver dime is the 
equivalent of ten copper cents or that a certain bag con- 
tains two pounds. « 
The first grade is also the place to. begin to proyide.the 
experiences essential to the later handling of reasoning 
problems....The meaning of the common units of measure 
can be developed only through actual experience with 
foot-rulers, pint cups, nickels, and the like. Each child 
should have the opportunity actually to manipulate these 
measures himself. The meaning of addition, subtraction,  
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
multiplication, gad division may easily be taught by the 
use of objects.” If one child has eight marbles and an- 
other has five, and there is need to know how many both 
together have, the natural and right thing to do is to 
_bring both sets of marbles near together and count all 
of them. Similar procedure applies to the other processes 
as well. More or less experience of this sort is positively 
essential and indispensable to the understanding of the 
words “add,” “sum,” “ subtract,” “ remainder,” and 
the like. In multiplication the meanings of the words 
“times ” and “ product ” must be developed in this self- 
same way. Many teachers prepare large numbers of 
small pasteboard squares with which the children build 
larger squares and rectangles. Thus, “three times 
four ”’ becomes associated with a rectangle built of the 
pasteboard squares with three squares on one side and 
four on the other. This is also an excellent method of 
showing that “ three times four ” and “ four times three ” 
are the same. id ” } 
The work in division grows naturally out of the work in 
multiplication. A three-by-four rectangle made of paste- 
board squares contains rows and columns each of which 
represents a third and a fourth of twelve respectively. 
The better children of the grade may even be taught to 
find three fourths of twelve, two thirds of fifteen, and the 
like by means of the squares. The work with the squares 
or other objects is absolutely necessary to the success of 
the work in the upper grades. It should be given, there- 
fore, either at the last of the first year or the first of the 
second. 
The amount of work suggested here will not be sufficient 
for the brighter children. Such children should be en- 
couraged to go on with their counting and reading of 
numbers. They will be able to dispense with the objects  
-P-A-G-E-85
_WHAT TO TEACH IN EACH GRADE — 75 
very quickly. As a general rule no child should be 
allowed to work with objects any longer than is necessary 
to form a basis for the more abstract work later. 
Tue Work For GRADE Two 
The second grade is the place where fixed periods in 
thedaily schedule are first assigned to number. work. 
Two questions of very great importance must be an- 
swered, however, beforehand: First, unless much valuable 
time and energy are to be wasted, the teacher must find 
out whether or not all her pupils have reached sufficient 
mental maturity to do formal work in arithmetic. Second, 
she must know whether or not they have had sufficient 
experience in dealing with objects to constitute a basis 
for the work which is to follow. The mental level of the 
child is best established by the use of an intelligence test, 
Where this is impossible, an inspection of the grades made 
by the child during the previous year will have to’be used 
as a basis of estimate. If the child’s grades were low and 
if he fails to learn or retain the easy combinations, the 
teacher will be justified in the belief that she should wait 
until he grows a little more before she devotes much extra 
time to him. \ 
Inventory for grade two. \Po find out whether or not 
the pupils have had sufficient experience to constitute a 
basis for advanced work)\it is recommended that an in- 
formal inventory test be used. The following form is 
suggested. The questions are addressed to each of the 
children, but the information may generally be obtained 
from all at once.

Questions such as these will give the teacher an idea 
of what the children know. The prerequisite experience 
for successful number work in the second grade is not well 
known, but the following words may be considered as an 
approximate arithmetical vocabulary which the children 
should possess when they enter this grade:

It is almost certain that very few pupils have all this 
information upon entering the second grade; but each 
child will have some of it, and what he does not know he 
should learn as soon as possible. 
It will be well to review during the first few days the 
work which has been done with the pasteboard squares 
so as to fix again firmly in the minds of all the children

Much informal practice should be afforded in one-step 
reasoning problems, but these should under no circum- 
stances require the use of combinations other than those 
listed above. If any of the children show a tendency to 
juggle the figures, they should be provided immediately 
with further experiences with pasteboard squares and other 
objects. The objects mentioned in the reasoning problems 
should never be those with which the children have had 
no experience. The problem, “ If one sibtad costs 5 cents, 
how much will four sibtads cost?” will prove at least 
slightly embarrassing to many adults. One should think 
of four times five, but there is an almost uncontrollable 
tendency to wonder what a sibtad is. This is an irrele- 
vant thought and is absolutely valueless for the problem in

with an\inventory of what the children know concerning 
what has gone before. } Ask the pupils to write the num- 
bers from 1 to 45 in a’column, leaving space at the right 
of the column. Read one of “the combinations listed on 
page 77. Say, for example, “ How much is 2 and 3? 
Write what you think this is just after the number 1 on 
your tablet.” See that all get it in the right space. 
Then say, “I am going to read some more combinations 
to you. Please write the answers after 2, 3, 4, etc. I 
am going to read them quite rapidly. You will have to 
hurry if you keep up. If you do not know the right 
answer, skip the space and go to the next number.” 
Read the remaining combinations im chance order. Do 
not use the order given on page 77. 
In order to help some children to get back on the track 
j after they have bes n “lost,” it is well to say, “ Number 
“ zo is so and so.” / Then proceed as before. Both teacher 
and pupil will need preliminary practice before the final 
try-out is made,) (The pupil will need practice to enable 
him to skip cofrectly when he does not know the com- 
bination. )/The teacher will need practice to enable her 
to read the combinations regularly and at the correct rate 
of speed.) A reasonable time between readings for the 
beginning of grade three is six seconds. Use a similar pro- 
cedure for the combinations given on pages 77, 78, and 79. 
List all combinations missed and remember that trouble 
with the preceding combination often causes a child to 
miss a combination which he would know otherwise.

It is worth while also to test the children on the types of 
column addition and reasoning problems which they 
studied in the second grade. A check should likewise 
be taken of the mastery which the children have of the 
special vocabularies and abbreviations listed on pages 76 
and 82. This inventory will afford a basis upon which 
teachers can intelligently plan their review work.

tion as a prerequisite for multiplication are given in the 
Appendix, pages 165-66. Two groups are given com- 
posed of those which are relatively easy and those which 
are relatively difficult. The easy ones should be taught 
first. No multiplication involving carrying is to be pre- 
sented until the corresponding addition combinations 
have been mastered. The combinations in simple addi- 
tion, subtraction, and multiplication are to be taught in 
the equation form also. The higher-decade additions 
are to be taught only in the equation form. The children 
should have by this time a complete mastery of the signs 
+, —, X, +, and =. The plus and equality signs
-P-A-G-E-97

should be used with the higher-decade additions along 
with the words “ and ” and “ equals.” 
Application of the combinations. An application of 
any of the combinations listed on pp. 84-86 invariably 
involves “ borrowing” or “ carrying.” Both of these 
terms are often included under the one term “ bridging.” 
The mastery of these two difficulties is one of the main} 
purposes in the third grade. Further suggestions on 
these troublesome points are given on page 126. After 
the children have learned the combinations listed above, 
they are prepared to do all sorts of column addition, 
provided not more than three is carried in any case. Simple 
and compound multiplication should be taken up. Short 
division may be introduced informally, but only the. 
simplest forms should be used. 
[/ (The third grade i is the place to begin formal work with 
e-step_reasoning problems,).'No problems with more 
“than one step should be used. Particular effort must 
be made to see that a sufficient amount of practice is 
given to establish a sense of which of the four processes 
is to be used. (Oneste problems involye either addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, or division. )) No evidence is 
at hand to show how much practice isrequired to yield 
a mastery of each type. It is probable, however, that 
the types are not of equal difficulty. From data at hand 
it seems safe to estimate that the order, ranging from 
easy to difficult, is addition, multiplication, subtraction, 
and division. The teacher should note particularly any 
pupils who fail to respond properly to any of these types 
and should provide additional practice with the paste- 
board squares to remedy the particular type of weakness 
which the pupil exhibits. Two fundamental principles 
‘ should always be observed : 
1 See page 74. 
   
-P-A-G-E-98
  ie CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 88. 
V Never allow a pupil to attempt a problem wit 
N _AAhings he has not experienced. 
2) Do not present problems which have no practical 
application in real life. \ t 
An observance of the latter principle involves a careful 
scrutiny of each problem, since problems which violate 
it are to be found even in our best textbooks.!

the fourth grade will be the mastery of long and short divi- 
sion. The work must begin with a study of the subtrac- 
tion involved in short division. This subtraction is not of 
the written sort and has received no practice up to this 
time. Be sure, therefore, to see that your pupils have a 
mastery of every subtraction combination listed on pages 
167-69. These exercises should not be used in the col- 
umn form — at least such usage is of little or no value as a 
prerequisite for division. Teach these combinations either 
in the form given or in some form in which the child is 
required to deal mentally with the numbers as wholes.

\ "Short division without carrying has been studied in the 
y third grade to some extent, but it will be necessary to start 
at the beginning again since the third-grade work was en- 
tirely informal in character. 
The order of procedure is as follows: Bevin with exer- 
Aa cises which do not involve carrying.) Only a few of these 
are in existence in simple form. Samples are as follows: <,

The list can be extended by using three or more figures in 
the dividend, but in each case every additional digit used 
must exactly contain the divisor. Short division should 
always be introduced by means of these exercises because 
the only new element is the presence of more than one 
figure in the quotient. 
When this type of division is well established, review 
the easier portion of the subtraction on pages 167-68. 
Then proceed to the short-division exercises which begin 
with the easy division combinations listed on pages 169-71, 
, and end in such a manner-as to leave no remainder when 
Q 5 \/ the division is complete:—Carrying will be the new ele- 
._- ment here, and special attention must be paid to its mas- 
tery. \ The list on pages 169-71 can be used as an inven- 
tory at any time, as described on page 83. As soon as 
any child answers 95 per cent correctly, review him on the 
more difficult subtraction list (page 168) and then let him 
take up the more difficult combinations on pages 171-72, 
always adding a digit to the dividend so that no remainders
-P-A-G-E-101
  WHAT TO TEACH IN EACH GRADE _ gt 
will be obtained. Use the hard lists in subtraction and 
division as inventories from time to time in order to dis- 
cover pupils who are ready to proceed to the next step. 
The next step will be to(familiarize the children with 
exercises in which there is a remainder.) It is suggested 
that the pupils be taught for the presént to write their 
quotients as so much with so much over. The first prob- 
lems involving remainders should be those made up of the 
easier combinations in both subtraction and. division. 
\_ The final step in short division will be(the mastery of 
/ “situations in which child meets dividends which are 
less than the divisors.) Special attention should be de- 
voted to these exercises because they fortify the pupil 
against the notorious error of failing to write zeros in the 
quotient when necessary. This type of drill is also an 
indispensable prerequisite for percentage. Guard the 
child against the idea that the dividend is always greater 
than the divisor. The list of exercises on pages 171-72 
contains all of the forty-five simple elements of this sort. 
Use it frequently as an inventory. 
When the child has progressed thus far, he is ready for 
long division. This part of our number work is of well- 
known difficulty. Most of the trouble is the result either 
of presenting too many new difficulties at once or of pre- 
senting them in the wrong order. It is quite essential, 
therefore, that the teacher follow the order suggested on 
pages 173 ff. inthe presentation of the exercises. The easi- 
est divisors in long division are 10, 11, 20, 21, 30, 31, etc. 
With them the child can devote most of his attention to 
the single new element involved, namely, the form of opera- 
tion. Such exercises are listed as Class A on page 173. 
The classes of exercises which follow in the appendix are 
planned so as to introduce one new major difficulty and 
only one at a time. Class B includes exercises involving
-P-A-G-E-102
  
  02 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
carrying; Class C, those involving borrowing; and Class 
D, those involving both carrying and borrowing. In 
Class E the pupil meets for the first time situations in 
which the estimated quotient will ordinarily be wrong. 
The exercises in this and the following classes should under 
no circumstances be presented before classes A, B, C, and 
D are mastered. It is probably advisable to give drill in 
examples having more than two figures in the quotient and 
divisor before confronting the child with exercises which 
give special trouble in the estimation of the quotient. The 
brighter children will be able to master long division during 
the fourth grade, but it is quite probable that many pupils 
should not even attempt exercises as difficult as those in 
Class G. The division ladder given on page 178 will be 
of value in ascertaining how far each pupil has progressed, 
provided, of course, that there has been no practice upon 
the test before it is used. 
Reasoning problems. The work in pro s should be 
continued much as in the third grade. \\Few two-step 
problems are advisable in grade four.) One sort should be 
taught, however. Pupils should be able by the end of the 
year to tell how much change should be received after 
several articles have been purchased. ‘Three-step problems 
of this sort should also be taught because of their great 
social importance. The processes involved are, of course, 
multiplication, addition, and subtraction. Valuable prac- 
tice on one-step problems may be obtained in the fourth 
grade by asking the pupils to make up one-step reasoning 
problems in each of the four processes. 
Applications of the combinations. Continued practice 
should be afforded in all of the work outlined up to this 
point in all sorts of settings; but the numbers should not 
be larger than those in ordinary use outside of school. 
Some drill should also be given in the addition of decades

WHAT TO TEACH IN EACH GRADE g3 
higher than those suggested heretofore. It is hoped, how- 
ever, that sufficient transfer will occur so that the remain- 
ing higher decade additions may be mastered without any 
great amount of practice. The teacher should conscien- 
tiously persist in requiring pupils to do their work aloud 
when mistakes have occurred that cannot be detected 
accurately from inspection. This means individual atten- 
tion to certain pupils, but it is worth the cost since no 
other method is available for the discovery of serious indi- 
vidual disabilities. 
Upper GRADE WorkK 
A detailed discussion of the work in the upper grades is 
beyond the scope of this book. A few things may be 
suggested which are known to be essential to those who 
would_use corrective types of arithmetic. 
(x)LAt the beginning of each school yegr an inventory 
should be taken to detect any Sembnistees the previous 
grades which have been forgotten or which were never 
Cae TT he most important group of errors in each of 
the upper grades centers around the fundamental combina- 
tions which should have been learned in the primary 
grades. The exercises in the appendix of this volume 
should be given each year to all pupils who show inaccu- 
racy in their work. Rugg and Clark! found that one of 
the few major errors in the algebra work of some fifty chil- 
dren was the inability to do accurately the primary number 
work involved in the algebra exercises. The most sen- 
sible thing to do for pupils of this sort is to take an inven- 
tory of their arithmetic knowledge and see just what is 
causing the failure of the pupils in their algebra work.

(2) The fifth gr ‘ade is usually the place where the pupils 
are supposed to) obtain a reasonable mastery of common 
fractio The facts of corrective arithmetic which apply 
in this grade are not well worked out. The following, 
however, are worthy of consideration. 
Confine your efforts to the teaching of those fractions 
which are of most social value. Most of the fractions con- 
sidered should have denominators less than 13. 
Guard against mere juggling with denominators and 
numerators. Two possibilities are at hand to meet this 
difficulty. One is the out-and-out memorization of the 
most important combinations of fractions. Pupils should 
know at sight the answer to $+ 4 just as they know 7 
times 9. The other is the habit of falling back upon the 
pasteboard squares as a means of checking answers. 
Suppose, for example, that a child has said that 3 + dis}. 
(Many do say so.) Have the child build a rectangle of 
say twelve squares and let him count out what he gets 
when he takes out 4 and then 4 of the twelve. This, by 
the way, is an excellent preparation for the very trouble- 
some exercises on the type “ What part of 12 is 10?” and 
the like. — 
In grade six |the children will be required to gain a 
mastery of decimal fractions. ')As a corrective measure in 
reducing common fractions to decimals, stress again the 
fact that the divisor is often less than the dividend. A 
good way to do this is through the use of ordinary prob- 
lems involving money. For example, “ Five boys are 
planning to pull the weeds from a man’s garden. The 
man will pay them three dollars. How much will each 
boy get if they all share equally? ” 
Experience shows that children have much trouble with 
the use of the decimal point. See to it that the point 
is placed correctly. In the addition and subtraction of 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
WHAT TO TEACH IN EACH GRADE = 95 
decimals it will be difficult for the children to keep the 
points even. The reason for this is the notion, well 
established by this time, that the right-hand ends of the 
numbers to be added or subtracted must be kept even. 
In subtraction, matters are still further complicated by 
the idea that the minuend always appears larger than the 
subtrahend. In such an exercise as 10 — 3.75, there is con- 
sequently a strong tendency to write the exercise in the 
form Aa and thus to obtain an answer of 365. Fur- 
ther suggestions of spots in which corrective work is needed 
are given on pages 47, 50, 52,and 54. Each of the types of 
errors listed on those pages indicates danger spots in the 
child’s path, 
Do not fail to give continued practice on the equation 
form. If your pupils are not well acquainted with this 
form by the time they reach the upper grades, you cannot 
do better corrective work than to emphasize it. Samples 
of the exercises follow :

CHAPTER VIII 
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 
Tue fundamental thesis of corrective arithmetic is the 
idea that the function of the teacher is to help the child to 
learn things of value in arithmetic which he is capable of 
learning, but has not learned. The problem. of every 
teacher consists, therefore, in finding out what the pupils 
of a given grade need to learn and can learn and how they 
may best learn it. The teacher’s method must conse- 
quently be based upon an observance of the laws and 
principles of growth and of learning. It will be the main 
purpose of this chapter to indicate the most important of 
these laws and principles and to show how they apply to 
the teaching of arithmetic. 
Tue Laws AND PRINCIPLES OF GROWTH 
Growth means vastly more than mere increase in size. 
Children are not little men and little women even in a 
physical sense. Until this fact was recognized, there was 
no sound basis for method in education — in fact, little 
method was necessary. If children were like adults in 
every respect save that of size, and if all adults were alike, 
then any adult could teach equally as well as any other 
adult. He could teach all that he had ever learned by the 
same method as that by which he himself had learned it. 
This fallacy more than anything else is responsible for 
the relatively retarded condition of the science of educa- 
tion. Many highly intelligent’ people even now insist 
that there is no such thing as a science of education. A 
gradually increasing recognition of the difference between 
Too

PRINCIPLES ‘OF METHOD Ior 
children and adults is clearing the way, however, for the 
advancement of educational practice and the develop- 
ment of teaching into an expert occupation. 
Differences between children and adults. \ First of all, 
there are the very apparent differences in size and strength: 
- It is also quite evident that little children cannot codrdi- 
nate their muscles as well as grown-ups. Children are 
more active physically than adults and are more inclined 
to play. The interests of children are unique and char- 
acteristic of different ages in child life. Children are less 
capable of sustained attention, less able to resist distrac- 
tions. They are inexperienced and therefore incapable of 
judging or reasoning as well as adults. The attention 
span of children is relatively limited. They are also 
relatively incapable of thinking or remembering in a logi- 
cal manner. 
The teaching of arithmetic is still suffering because of 
delusion in regard to these matters. The writers of some 
textbooks and the authors of some standard tests still 
expect children to deal with huge numbers and to add ex- 
tremely high columns. These authors are interested in 
such things and assume that children are likewise inter- 
ested in them and that they are capable of doing the work 
involved. Some teachers assume that their pupils are 
interested in knowing why a fractional divisor is inverted 
or why you square the radius of a circle and multiply it by 
3.1416 in order to find the area. Some textbooks are still 
‘Rigeming with reasoning problems which no sane person 
5ypuld ever use in a real situation. Indeed, we are barely 
free from the time when children were compelled to learn 
“ apothecary’s weight,” “‘ Vermont rule for partial pay- 
ments,” “true discount,” and numerous other things 
solely for the reason that teachers and textbook makers 
were interested in them., Those who expect to be good
-P-A-G-E-112
    ‘182 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
teachers must learn first of all that it is their function to 
help little children to grow into good adults. 
Individual differences. “A~second principle of funda- 
mental importance is the fact that different children grow 
at different rates. A century ago this fact was totally 
unrecognized. As a result we have, among other things, 
the grade system of school organization. If all children 
grow at equal rates, it follows that all will reach a given 
stage of development at the same time. Hence we expect 
all six-year-olds to be in the first grade, all seven-year-olds 
to bein the second, andsoon. But the truth of the matter 
is that some children belong in the first grade at the age 
of four, while some cannot do first-grade work at the age of 
twelve. Thus in many schools teachers are trying to 
teach pupils who are utterly incapable of learning what 
they are trying to teach, while other pupils in the same 
grade are bored almost to distraction with tasks which to 
them are infantile. 
The application of this principle to the teaching of 
arithmetic has already been pointed out several times. 
Some children in the second grade should not be expected 
to do abstract number work and some in grade eight are 
not able to do arithmetic reasoning. Do not attempt the 
impossible in your teaching. Do not attempt to force 
stupid little children to overstrain themselves in an effort 
to learn that which is beyond them. 
Varying rates of growth in the same individual. The 
idea that individual children have varying rates of growth 
both physically and mentally was first set forth in a prom- 
inent manner by G. Stanley Hall about the beginning of 
the present century.’ Hall’s writings exerted a far- 
reaching influence and tinged the educational thinking of 
that whole period. The coming of more accurate means 
> ‘Hall G. Stanley, Adolescence. Preface, page xiii and elsewhere. 1904. 4, +
-P-A-G-E-113
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 103 
of measurement, however, has shown that some of Hall’s 
conclusions were overdrawn and overemphasized. In 
recent years, Baldwin and others have been attacking the 
problem of growth in a more scientific manner.’ It is 
now known with certainty that the growth of a normal 
child is quite regular from year to year both physically 
and mentally. There are variations, but they are not of 
the spectacular sort which Hall described. 
One must not forget, however, that Baldwin’s results 
are for average or normal children only. No evidence has 
been produced to show that the rate of growth is constant 
for every child. Common observation tells us that a long 
illness often retards physical growth. We know too that 
mental growth is subject to similar variations in individual 
cases. Retardation in the rate of growth is called arrested 
development. 
Such a period of arrest may be either temporary or per- 
manent. For this reason it is not safe as yet to predict 
concerning the future growth of any child either physi- 
cally or mentally. We know that the great majority of 
children who are tall at birth will be tall when grown. We 
know, too, that by far the most of the children who have a 
mentality on the Binet Scale of eighty per cent of the 
average for their age will continue to have about eighty 
per cent mentality on that scale all of their lives. But 
there is a minority who are suffering at any given time 
from a temporary arrest. The teacher should be con- 
stantly on the lookout for these few pupils. Sometimes 
the cause of the trouble is merely poor eyesight, adenoids, 
or the malfunctioning of some gland. If the trouble can 
be found and removed, the child will often grow with suf- 
ficient rapidity to make up for lost time.

Fifteenth Yearbook, National Society for the Study of Education, part 1, pages 11-22. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  104. CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
The application of these facts to the teaching of arith- 
metic is evident. Children who are suffering from physi- 
cal defects often fail to keep up with their grades. Some- 
times the cause of the arrest in arithmetic is partly emo- 
tional. Mary may get low grades in her arithmetic work 
because she has not had sufficient experience to enable her 
to understand the reasoning problems or because she re- 
sponds wrongly to a few of the essential number combina- 
tions listed in the Appendix of this book. At the same 
time she may be doing excellent work in geography; spell- 
ing, and reading. Mary’s parents soon find that her 
grades are low in arithmetic, but high in other things. 
Now, instead of seeking for the cause of the trouble in 
the arithmetic, both teachers and parents will sometimes 
coéperate to build up in Mary’s mind the idea that she 
“ just can’t get arithmetic, but is good in everything else.” 
Such a condition leads straight toward what the psycholo- 
gists call an inferiority complex. Mary gradually comes 
to have a permanent feeling of inferiority with reference 
to arithmetic. Her development, already obstructed by 
other causes, becomes more and more retarded because of 
the emotional element involved and finally settles down to 
a condition of permanent arrest. 
Teachers should guard most carefully against making 
prophecies concerning the future progress of a retarded 
child. Strengthen the pupil’s morale all you can. Seek 
diligently for the cause of the trouble. Do not waste 
your time and overburden a pupil by attempting to teach 
him what he cannot learn in his present condition. Pro- 
vide for him the most stimulating, environment possible 
and wait for him to grow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 105 
Tue Laws or LEARNING 
The law of use. We have seen how mistakes have been 
made by ignorance or disregard of the laws and principles 
of growth. It is equally disastrous to neglect or ignore 
the laws of learning. We all have an unfortunate tend- 
ency to overemphasize that which is most open to the ob-\_ 
servation and to ignore that which is somewhat obscure. 
The statement that {practice makes perfect ” is a prov- 
erb whose origin is lost in remote antiquity.» Every man 
and woman in the street has heard the proverb and believes 
it. Belief is tremendously strengthened by the idea that 
all men are equal intellectually and emotionally. But 
the proverb is often not true, and the idea of intellectual 
and emotional equality is entirely false. - When is it that 
practice does make perfect? Every teacher should know 
this and know it definitely because it is one of the phases 
of expertness which teachers must have if they are to be 
experts at all. To say that practice always makes per- 
fect is just as absurd as to say that a body in motion will 
remain in motion forever. Both statements are true so 
long as no opposing forces or obstacles get in the way. 
In the learning process the opposing forces are produced 
by the violation of some of the other laws of learning. 
The law of effect. {In educational psychology the idea 
that practice makes perfect is called “ the law of use.” 
For generations it was thought that all of human learning 
was subject to this one law. Now we know that just as a 
body in motion is always subject to the force of gravity, so 
the law of use can never operate independently of another 
force. The law which,expresses this other force is called __ 
“ the law of effect.” //The law of use tells us that things 
which are practiced or repeated tend to become permanent 
in the mind. | The law of effect says that things which be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
come permanent in the mind must be satisfying to us. 
Practice with things that are annoying does not lead to 
improvement or permanence. Practice in eating break- 
fast food may make us want breakfast food every morn- 
ing, but practice in having one’s teeth pulled does not 
make us want to repeat the experience. Persons who are 
greatly afraid of water do not learn to swim. Girls who 
detest sweeping do not make good housekeepers. Boys 
who hate plowing do not make good farmers. Children 
who hate school do not learn much. Practice under such 
conditions tends to make us imperfect rather than perfect. 
Practice makes perfect only when the results of the practice 
“are satisfying to the person whois practicing. 
An old fallacy. We are just emerging from a period in 
which the law of effect was entirely neglected and even ° 
opposed. Many of our ancestors believed thoroughly 
that man was “ born in iniquity and conceived in sin.” 
From this it followed quite naturally that children were 
sinful creatures. Therefore, whatever satisfied them was 
evil and useless, while whatever annoyed them was good 
and worth while. According to such philosophy the func- 
tion of the teacher was to the teach the child to do “ what 
he did not like to do.” A school in which the children 
were contented and happy was therefore a poor school ; 
and one in which the children were bored and unhappy 
was a good one. 
This philosophy is still in vogue among many laymen. 
Witness the frequent appearance of newspaper cartoons 
showing how children hate the school. Such a point of 
view could scarcely be worse for the progress of the science 
of education. The writer remembers an institute which 
he attended some years ago, in which a young teacher got 
up and asked timidly how to make a fourth-grade lesson 
in nature study interesting. There was a prolonged 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 107 
silence. Then the most experienced superintendent in the 
group arose and said, ‘‘ The school isn’t supposed to be 
as interesting asa circus. The school is a place for work.” 
It would have been far better if her school board had kept 
the young teacher at home. With such a heritage back of 
us and with such misconceptions still prevalent among our 
patrons, it behooves us as teachers to study very carefully 
the applications of the law of effect and use it wisely. 
Avoidance of extremes. There are two dangers to be 
avoided. One is the complete failure to observe the law 
and the other (which is just as bad) the elevation of the 
law of effect'into an object of worship.) Some teachers 
have grown so enthusiastic that they refuse to have the 
children practice upon anything that is not at first sight 
interesting to them. Children are not wicked as some of 
our forefathers thought, yet they are in a certain sense 
young savages. They have inherited most of what they 
are from a remote ancestry which knew nothing of line 
fences, refined manners, the alphabet, or the multiplica- 
tion table. It follows, therefore, that the immediate in- 
terests of children are those of the savage and not those of 
the twentieth-century adult. If this were not true, there 
would be no need for a teaching profession. The chil- 
dren would learn all that they need to know without 
teachers. 
As matters stand, however, teachers have very impor- 
tant things todo. The most important task of all for the 
teacher is to begin with the interests of the children as 
they are and gradually to widen and direct them until they 
include everything which humanity in a slow and painful 
evolution has found to be worth while. This is in itself a 
tremendous task, but it can be done. Children’s inter- 
ests develop and spread with marvelous rapidity when 
the right environment is provided. To provide this en-  
-P-A-G-E-118
  CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 108 
vironment is the function of the teacher, and it is here that 
she can attain unto a true and genuine expertness. 
The technique for the application of the law of use has 
been almost common knowledge for generations. But 
we have no established technique for the application of the 
law of effect. Much, however, has been written on this 
topic in the last quarter of a century and we are learning 
many things. The process of applying the law of effect 
is often called ‘ motivation.” A further consideration 
of the details of this process must be postponed to the next 
chapter. For the present we shall proceed to a discussion 
of a few of the general principles involved from the stand- 
point of corrective arithmetic. 
Some general principles. . the first place, the teacher 
must remember that arithmetic was of comparatively 
little use to the savage. From this it is suggested that 
even the brightest pupils in! nerit very little in the way of 
immediate interest in eae That is why the teacher 
of the first grade must busy herself in an effort to awaken 
such an interest through the manipulation of actual ob- 
jects and through pertipaton in group activities which 
involve quantitative relations. This first work is of 
fundamental importance, however, because without it the 
law of effect will work anne the law of use instead of with 
it. | Every effort must be made to make the child inter- 
ested in learning the number facts which he must learn in 
order to take his proper place in organized society. The 
facts referred to here are o in detail in the Appendix. 
The problem in hand is to

  uncomfortable seats, squalid surroundings, too much con- _ 
finement in one position, foul atmosphere, physical pains, 
malnutrition, and the like. They are satisfied by kind 
words, smiling faces, moderate temperatures, appropriate 
light, comfortable seats, pleasing environment, freedom of 
movement, pure air, and bodily comfort.-/ The first task 
of the teacher is to banish the annoyances and provide the 
proper satisfiers) 
The teacher must also remember that. many satisfiers 
are not conducive to progress in arithmetic. To watch a 
circus parade or a dog fight is intensely satisfying to chil- 
dren, but it is not conducive to the learning of arithmetic. 
Banish, therefore, so far as possible, all irrelevant satis- 
fiers along with the annoyers. Provide for the correct 
operation of the law of effect if you expect your teaching to 
be a success. A great amount of corrective work can be 
done by observing this one principle. 
FAaticue 
The law of use and the law of effect are the most general 
of all the laws of learning in their application. The other 
laws are, however, of great value in special situations. 
Teachers often need to have accurate information concern- 
ing fatigue. In this connection the most important thing 
to remember is that most of what is called fatigue is not 
fatigue in reality. It was once thought that human beings 
were like storage batteries and that rest and sleep were for 
the purpose of recharging them with energy. According 
to this doctrine, it was held that the early morning was 
the best time for work. The hours after the evening meal 
were likewise regarded as the poorest because by that time 
nearly all of the energy accumulated during the previous 
night would be exhausted. For the same reason it was 
recommended that difficult subjects like arithmetic should
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
come the first thing in the school day before much of the 
store of energy was exhausted. 
It was asserted by others that fatigue was caused by 
the accumulation of chemical poisons in the blood. Sleep 
and rest according to this theory was for the purpose of 
cleansing the blood. In the morning the blood would 
naturally be more pure than in the afternoon. So we 
arrived by another route at the conclusion that the most 
difficult subjects should be taught first in the day. 
BorEDOM 
At present both of these theories are in the discard. 
They were intended to apply for the most part to physical 
fatigue, and it was assumed that mental fatigue could be 
accounted for in the same manner. This assumption has 
been seriously questioned. It is a matter of common 
knowledge that many excellent students do their best 
work just before they retire instead of just after they get 
up. Of more importance still is the distinction which 
has been made between fatigue and boredom. Boredom 
affects both men and animals, and its effects are so similar 
to those of fatigue as to be almost indistinguishable from 
them. There was an old saying among the farm hands 
that no one could ever work a mule so hard that he would 
not run and kick up his heels when it was necessary to stop 
the work in the fields and hasten to the farmhouse to 
escape the oncoming storm. Children are much the same. 
Who has not seen a room full of apparently almost ex- 
hausted children suddenly transformed by the sudden 
ringing of the fire-gong? The truth of the matter is that 
healthy children in school seldom if ever feel the sensation 
of mental fatigue. On the other hand, some children are 
often unutterably bored in almost every school. 
~The curve of average achievement has some fluctua-
-P-A-G-E-121
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD It 
tions in it during the day, but these fluctuations are rela- 
tively insignificant and are due for the most part to bore- 
dom. All of this means that the important thing for the 
teacher to do is to prevent boredom. Don’t keep the 
children at one thing too long: Practice periods upon 
such material as that given in the Appendix of this book 
should never exceed two minutes unless the practice oc- 
curs in connection with a game. Even then the extremely 
long practice period is to be avoided. Fifteen minutes at 
a time will be an abundance in the primary grades even 
for the game. As a general rule, always change the work 
as soon as the children appear to be tired. In ninety- 
nine cases out of a hundred they are bored and not fatigued. 
. 
MULTIPLE RESPONSE 
Other principles of learning are of interest because they 
explain many of the errors listed in Chapters IV and V. 
Consider the juggling with figures which is so common 
when children attempt to solve reasoning problems which 
they do not understand. When a child or an animal finds 
itself in a difficult situation from which it must escape, it 
employs, one after another, all of the reactions which it is 
capable of making. Recently a certain man who was just 
learning to drive his car, which was of a well-known and 
widely used make, had the disagreeable sensation which 
comes from finding one’s self stalled on a country road. 
He knew very little about automobiles, but he got out and 
began to manipulate various parts of the car in a vague 
and indiscriminate manner, but without success. Finally 
in despair he gave the car a good shake, climbed in, and 
started off without further difficulty. He does not know 
why he succeeded, but it is safe to assume that he will do 
some more shaking next time his car stalls. 
The foregoing is an excellent illustration of the manner
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
in which many pupils attack their reasoning problems. 
Any of us in a totally unfamiliar situation would react 
ina similar manner. The trouble is always due to a lack 
of prerequisite experience. Wild answers and juggling 
with figures are always reliable signs. It is a natural hu- 
man reaction and always calls for a specific type of treat- 
ment. Reasoning is conditioned upon judgments and 
judgments are in turn conditioned upon experience. To 
attempt to teach reasoning without previous experience 
and without previous practice in forming judgments is 
sure to be futile. 
\ Tue Law or ANALOGY \ 
Another cause for many errors in arithmetic is the oper- 
ation of the\law of analogy.) When men or animals meet 
with a situation which is partly new to them, they are 
likely to react in the same manner as they do to the old 
situation which is most like the new one. Thus children 
who have had practice in the addition of numbers in a 
single column when brought suddenly face to face with a 
situation like nf will often get 515 for an answer. In 
like manner, if they are asked to multiply 3 ft. 6 in. by 3, 
they will get 10 feet and 8 inches because 36 X 3 = 108. 
Such results are invariably due to the fact that the child 
is not conscious of the new elements involved. The 
remedy for the situation is emphasis upon this new ele- 
ment. 
ANALYsIS 
The process by which children are made conscious of 
the new elements in their work is called analysis. Prac- 
tice in analysis has three phases: (z) identification ¢f the 
new element; (2) practice in distinguishing the new ele-
-P-A-G-E-123
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 113 
ment from the old; -(3) identification of the new element 
in various situations.» 
Identification of the new element. In the first of the 
two examples given above, the new element is the fact 
that the numbers in one of the columns add up to more 
than 9. In the second example, the new element is the 
presence of the words “ feet ” and “inches.” Point out 
these new things very carefully to the children. 
Practice in distinguishing the new element from the 
old. In the first example the child knows how to react to 
exercises of the type on They are familiar. But ex- 
ercises of the type * are not so familiar. In the sec- 
ond example the child is familiar with exercises of the type 
“multiply 36 by 3,” but is not familiar with the type 
“multiply 3 ft. 6 in. by 3.” In both cases practice is 
needed to enable the pupil to know whether the particular 
exercise which confronts him belongs to the old or the new 
type. If it is of the old type, he knows what todo. If of 
the new, he has only one additional thing to remember. 
Identification of the new element in various situations. : 
Children need practice in carrying and knowing when to 
carry under various situations. The addition of digits 
other than 9 and 6 (as in the above example) makes carry- 
ing necessary. Carrying must be done in situations like 
the following: 
14 192 98 92 
23 26 76 4 
64 3t 32 183. 
Practice is needed in the carrying of 2 and 3 as. well as r,

and in multiplication as well as addition. In like manner 
the child must learn to react to the new denominate num- 
ber element in connection with yards and feet, quarts 
and pints, pounds and ounces as well as with feet and 
inches. 
INFERENCE 
Another principle of learning the neglect of which causes 
many errors is “ the principle of inference.” The ability 
to infer is one of the few things which definitely distin- 
guish human beings from lower animals. The ability to 
size up what happens under certain situations and to infer 
what will happen under others is of tremendous practical 
importance’ It is the only basis upon which we can plan 
intelligently for the future and it is fundamental to induc- 
tive reasoning. Trouble arises because little or nothing 
is known concerning the ability to infer which children 
possess at different ages. One of the simplest forms of 
inference is the expectation that whatever is customary 
and satisfactory will remain so. We all believe that next 
summer will be hot and next winter will be cold because 
summers have always been hot and winters cold. No one 
would care to step off of the roof of a high building because 
it has always been customary and satisfactory to avoid 
such actions. Now, it is entirely normal for children who 
have been getting correct answers by adding to continue 
to add even when the type of exercise is radically changed, 
The same is true to a less degree of subtraction, multiplica- 
tion, and division. This accounts for the very large num- 
ber of errors which children make through the use of the 
wrong process. ‘The way to correct this type of error is to 
emphasize more the analysis of new elements and the pres- 
ence of changed conditions.’ After this is done the teacher 
should not fail to provide abundant practice in mixed 
   
-P-A-G-E-125
  
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD IIs 
exercises which involve all of the fundamental operations 
in simple form. 
The worst mistake, however, has been to expect from 
little children greater powers than they really possess. 
Few children are able to infer that 4 X 3 = 3 X 4, that 
16 and 9 are 25 because 6 and g are 15, that since you mul- 
tiply the length by the width to find the area, so you divide 
the area by the length to find the width. Such ability is 
simply beyond the children at the ages when the above 
facts are expected to be learned. Under such circum- 
stances there are only two sensible types of procedure. 
We must find a new method of presentation or postpone 
the consideration of the facts until the pupils are old 
enough to infer correctly concerning them. As a general 
tule, proceed very carefully in those exercises which re- 
quire inference on the part of the pupils. They are in all 
probability much less able to infer than the teacher thinks. 
The principle of inference has already been discussed at 
some length under the name of transfer of training. The 
reader should read pages 11 ff. again at this point. After 
all, the best corrective measure under actual schoolroom 
conditions is to reduce to a minimum the number of situa- 
tions in which children in the primary grades are expected 
to use inference in the solution of their problems and exer- 
cises. 
ForGETTING 
(One of the most discouraging things about teaching is 
the fact that so much of the work has to be done over 
again. Children forget what they learn. At the end of 
the school year they seem to be well up in their work; 
but after the summer vacation the teacher often receives 
looks of blankness and dismay when she asks questions 
which seemed easy to the children at the close of the pre-

vious session. Weare all forgetful creatures. Who would 
want to remember everything, anyway? The advantages 
of forgetting probably far outweigh its disadvantages 
because, though we forget useful things along with the 
rest, we can easily relearn that which is worth remember- 
ing. Here is the basis for the insistence upon the use of 
inventory tests at the beginning of the new school year. 
Let us find out first of all how many valuable things the 
children have forgotten so that we can attend to these 
first. 
RELEARNING 
(The forgetfulness of children, however, is not a hope- 
less condition. Valuable corrective measures are possible, 
They are based on certain established facts. “In the first 
place, permanence of learning is possible only at the price 
of frequent relearning. One out of every five men who 
entered the army in the recent war could not read a news- 
paper intelligently. This was not because they had never 
learned to read. They were simply “out of practice.” 
In like manner, it is probable that very few adults who, 
twenty-five years ago, were star pupils in the Greek class, | 
would care now to attempt to read at sight a passage from : 
Herodotus or to conjugate a Greek verb. They, too, are 
“out of practice.” If such is the case with highly intelli- 
gent adults, the teacher should not be greatly disheartened 
when the little ones get “‘ out of practice.” 
In the second place, that which has been once learned 
well and then forgotten can be relearned in an extremely 
short time. / A very small amount of drill in silent reading 
would have changed the situation among the army re- 
cruits very decidedly for the better. Likewise a few min- 
utes’ review of the Greek grammar and the Herodotus 
book will work wonders for the star Greek pupil. Chil- 
   
-P-A-G-E-127
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 117 
dren will profit tremendously from a small amount of in- 
telligent review upon that which they knew last year. 
How To Improve THE MEMmory 
In the third place, a poor forgetter is a good memorizer. 
This brings up the question of how to improve one’s mem- 
ory and how to improve the memory of one’s pupils. 
Educational psychology has help for us on this point. 
Some of the facts are as follows: 
(x) The human brain is in many respects like a very complex 
telephone system. The long and slender nerve cells 
correspond to the wires. Some of the cells lead inward 
from the eyes, ears, and other sense organs to the brain, 
while others lead outward to the hands, feet, vocal or- 
gans, and the like. Still other cells act as connections . 
within the brain between the cells which bring in the’ 
sensations from the sense organs and those which carry 
out “‘messages” to the muscles. The teacher is to some 
extent at least like the switch-board operator whose 
business is to make and keep the right connections. 
(2) The process of remembering includes four phases — 
the formation, retention, recall, and recognition of these 
connections. 
(3) Connections which are made for the first time are likely 
to be more permanent. 
(4) The same is true of connections which are accompanied 
by vivid or striking feelings. 
(5) Single connections are more permanent than those of 
multiple type. ; 
(6) Connections are remembered best just as they are 
formed. 
(7) Recall is strengthened when the connections to be re- 
membered are associated closely with situations like those 
which the child will meet most frequently during the 
vacation and after life.

-P-A-G-E-128
118 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
The foregoing facts are so important that they merit 
further discussion. Every teacher should be familiar 
with the four phases of remembering, namely, the forma- 
tion of connections, their retention, recall, and recogni- 
tion. She should be on the lookout for any sort of device 
which will tend to strengthen connections. She should 
remember, too, that children grow at different rates and 
that there are tremendous variations in their ability to 
form and retain the connections which the teacher is 
striving to make. If we may return to the illustration of 
the telephone switchboard, we find some children whose 
minds are similar to an imaginary board in which the plugs 
are continually slipping out of the holes into which they 
are placed. Other children have minds like a switch- 
board in which the plugs can be pushed in only with 
great difficulty. When they are once in, however, there is 
little danger of their falling out. In other words, some 
children forget rather quickly almost everything that they 
have learned. Others learn very slowly but retain well. 
These are the two extremes, however. The average child 
learns with comparative ease and remembers reasonably 
well, provided the material is not beyond his grasp. The 
ability to retain seems to be largely inherited. No correc- 
tive procedure is known which can improve retention 
when it is lacking. The only hope is to wait for the child 
to grow. 
While little can be done to increase the child’s power of 
retention, much improvement can be made in the methods 
which promote memorizing. Present the new element 
as vividly as possible. Things are vivid to children when 
they appeal to fundamental interests and instincts. It is 
not possible within the limits of this book to discuss in 
detail what these fundamental interests and instincts are, 
but it is worth while to give at least one illustration. Chil-
-P-A-G-E-129
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD Ig 
dren are strongly individualistic. They are greatly inter* 
ested in their own well-being. Anything that enables 
them to excel or to promote their own interests is very 
satisfying to them. On the other hand, anything that 
interferes with their personal success or detracts from their 
reputation among their fellows is thoroughly annoying. 
All children like to engage in activities in which they can 
win and dislike anything that brings upon them, even in 
the slightest manner, the scorn or ridicule of their fellows. 
These instincts are crude, primeval forces which, like the 
lightning, do damage when undirected, but are very valu- 
able when controlled properly. Wise teachers know how 
to manipulate these forces. In the teaching of primary 
number, the desire of the children to win is often used. As 
soon as pupils find out that the number combinations 
which are being presented for the first time to-day will 
help them to win the game to-morrow, they become more 
interested, give more attention, and receive more vivid 
impressions. If, when the next day comes, some child has 
forgotten and fails to win, he experiences the discomfort 
which comes to us all when some one passes us in the race. 
He will tend to remember the cause of his failure and see 
to it that the accident does not occur again. All of this 
promotes vividness, and vividness should accompany the 
forming of the connections on which learning is based. 
The author recently visited a good teacher on the day 
on which she was introducing carrying in addition for the 
first time. When the first sum turned out to be 10 or 
more, she called attention to the fact that the sum was 
really one 10 and so many units. She reminded the chil- 
dren that they were to write the number of units only 
beneath the units column and instructed them to write the 
one ro at the top of the 10’s column. Then she said, 
“ There are some little children who forget to write what 
W
-P-A-G-E-130
  120 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
is to be carried at the top of the next column, but I am 
almost sure that no one in this room will ever be so foolish 
as that.” The result was that every child made a special 
effort to avoid this particular mistake because no one 
wanted to appear foolish. This is another illustration of 
how vividness of early impressions may be secured. 
Multiple connections are difficult to form and difficult to 
retain. For this reason it is a bad policy to teach number 
connections and rationalizations concerning them at the 
same time. Such devices as the use of bundles of sticks 
to explain carrying or borrowing; introducing the fours 
and eights as combinations of twos; trying to explain why 
you invert the divisor; attempting to teach the Austrian 
method of subtraction along with some other method; 
introducing such forms together as 4 is what part of 6? 
what part of 6 is 4? what per cent of 6 is 4? etc. — all of 
these are open to the objections stated above. To at- 
tempt to present more than one thing at a time is like try- 
ing to do two things at once. The probabilities are that 
neither will be done well. 
FUNDAMENTAL NumBER Facts Must BECOME 
AUTOMATIC 
There is yet another argument to show the futility of 
trying to teach more than one thing at a time. When a 
child fails to respond to a number connection, many teach- 
ers urge the pupil to think about it. They attempt to 
secure the correct response by reasoning. This is objec- 
tionable on several grounds. First, the other pupils are 
being deprived of time which should have been spent on 
them. Often they are bored almost to tears waiting for 
some retarded child to do successfully that which is per- 
fectly easy to them but which the slow child is unable to do 
at all. Second, memorizing combinations and reasoning 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 121 
about them are two quite different things and should not 
be taught together. Third, the procedure is of no value 
in real life. No one wants to have to stop and reason 
about 9 and 6 when he needs that combination. 
Suppose a girl goes into the city and sees a very attrac- 
tive hat in a store window. Suppose also that the girl 
needs the hat quite badly. As she stands there her 
thoughts are probably something like this: “I need the 
hat. It will be very becoming to me. All of my friends 
will remark about how well I look. Let me see, I have 
so many pounds of butter and butter sells at so much per 
pound. I can sell so many eggs at so much per dozen ” ; 
and so on. Then she begins multiplying and adding. 
Surely that girl should not be expected to reason about 
any particular number combinations which she is using. 
Allof her thoughts are and should be centered on the hat. 
The truth of the matter is that we must teach the funda- 
mental number facts so well that the pupils will respond 
to them correctly even when they are thinking or reasoning 
about something else. The use of numbers and reasoning 
concerning them almost never occur together in life. Our 
aim should be so to subject the number combinations to 
routine that reasoning will be set free to occupy itself 
elsewhere. Reasoning about primary numbers is there- 
fore just the thing which we should not do. See to it, 
therefore, that the number facts are presented as simple 
facts to be learned and remembered. After they are well 
mastered there will be plenty of time to practice their use 
in connection with reasoning. 
Space is available here merely to repeat what has been 
said several times before concerning the transfer of train- 
ing» (It-is not safe to expect most of the children to re- 
member connections in other settings than those in which 
they were first formed. Many a child who has learned 9 Tm 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
122 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
and 7 will be confused when he first meets with 29 and 7. 
Do not expect much from this sort of transfer and you will 
at least avoid being disappointed. 
The recall of useful connections is strengthened by asso- 
ciating these.connections with situations which occur fre- 
quently in life, For this reason it is an excellent idea to 
teach number’ combinations in connection with games 
which the children are likely to use during vacation and 
playtime. This is the chief justification for the use of 
such games as hopscotch and dominoes during the school 
hours. In like manner, wise teachers will attempt to tie 
up the finding of per cents with the calculation of baseball 
standings. 
Hasit FORMATION 
The mastery of primary arithmetic and the use of cor- 
rective arithmetic are both closely related to. the formation 
of habits. In the minds of many people the.word “habit” 
means something bad, but there are multitudes of good 
habits also. To see 7 X 9 and always to say, or be ready 
to say, 63 isa good habit. The steps involved in the for- 
mation of habits have been covered rather completely 
heretofore, but a summary will not be out of place here. 
The steps to be taken are as follows: 
1. Get the child to want to form the habit. In other 
words, always observe the law of effect. Motivate 
your work. : 
42. See that each child knows just what heistodo. This 
has been discussed under the subject of analysis. A 
copy of the inventory test which the child has taken 
will usually furnish convincing evidence of what 
remains to be learned. > 
3. Practice the new elements frequently and oe. 
ently but with short practice periods. : }
-P-A-G-E-133
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 123 
4. Avoid wrong responses as much as possible. The 
most important need which the teacher of arithmetic 
has is a means of diagnosis which will enable her to 
avoid allowing the children to practice errors or 
allowing them to practice connections which are 
already well formed. 
. Reward the right sort of practice in a suitable man- 
ner. There are various ways of doing this. A very 
good one is to keep a record of the scores made on 
successive practices, so as to show the amount of 
improvement. Encourage the children to try to 
beat their own past records. Nothing is more stimu- 
lating or satisfying than to be able to convince one’s 
self that one is getting somewhere. Many other 
devices of this sort are used by our best teachers. 
Some of them are listed in the next chapter. 
’6. Use the inventory tests frequently to discover what 
the children are forgetting. Provide additional 
practice where it is needed. wn 
QUESTIONS 
Special mention should be made at this point of a few 
questions which have recently received much attention 
from those who are interested in the teaching of arithmetic. 
Question 1. Should the pupils be required to check 
their work in every case or should the answers be pro- 
vided in the textbook? The law of effect requires that 
the child know just as soon as possible whether or not he 
has succeeded. This is a splendid argument in favor of 
supplying the answers at once to the child. On the other 
hand, we are told first, that children will juggle figures in 
order to obtain the answer when they know what it is; 
second, that children will work only to obtain the answez 
and not from sheer love for the task; third, that we are 
+ % “eae.
-P-A-G-E-134
    124 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
preparing children to solve problems in real life for which 
the answers are not known and will therefore not be avail- 
able. The argument concerning the juggling of figures 
will appeal to the lazy teacher. Pupils juggle figures to 
an alarming extent, even when they do not know the cor- 
rect answer. The teacher cannot escape her responsibil- 
ity on this point. It is her business to see that the pupils 
do not juggle figures. 
The statement that children will work merely to get the 
answer and not for the love of the task is scarcely worthy 
of notice. What sane person would ever want to solve a 
problem or work an exercise in arithmetic for any purpose 
other than to obtain the correct answer? 
The third argument is worthy of more serious considera- 
tion. Children must be taught how to check their an- 
swers. This is particularly valuable as a corrective device 
in common fractions and in the division of decimals. 
Checking must not be emphasized, however, to the extent 
of boring the pupil. This is particularly true in column 
addition. Most children do not object to adding upward 
but most of them detest adding downward after they have 
added upward. The use of checking is particularly harmful 
when used too soon. Children who have not mastered col- 
umn addition, for example, will be sure to make mistakes 
either in adding upward, in adding downward, or both. 
The result will be that the child will seldom if ever get his 
exercise to check. To practice something continually and 
fail continually is extremely discouraging. Practice of this 
sort makes the pupils imperfect rather than perfect. 
To avoid the foregoing intolerable situation, it will be 
necessary to furnish the correct answers until the exercises 
are well mastered. Then introduce and teach checking as 
a separate subject in the same manner as other new ele- 
ments are introduced and taught. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 12 
Question 2. In beginning column addition, shall the 
children be taught to add upward or downward? 
The most common practice is to teach the upward addi- 
tion first. No great amount of scientific data is available 
on the subject but that which we have indicates that the 
question is of small importance. Neither method can 
claim any significant advantage over the other. Under 
such circumstances it is preferable to follow the estab- 
lished usage. Teach adding upward first, but do not for- 
get to teach adding downward as a means of checking. 
Question 3. How shall subtraction be taught? 
Two methods are available. One is known generally 
while the other — the Austrian method —is not so well 
known. The latter method has received ardent support, 
however. Its advocates claim that it greatly decreases 
the work of the teacher because, by it, subtraction becomes 
merely an application of addition instead of seeming 
entirely new to the child. It is also asserted that the 
Austrian method is the one in common use in the making 
of change. 
The latter argument is the result of loose thinking and 
is not worth considering. Suppose, for example, you have 
purchased something for 55 cents and you hand the mer- 
chant a dollar. He hands you your change, saying, “ 55 
and 1o and 65 and 10 and 75 and 25 is one dollar.” But 
this is not the procedure of the Austrian method. It 
would be as follows: $1.00 « Five and five are ten. 
  
Put five in units’ place. Remember to carry your one and 
add it to the five in the tens’ place; 6 and 4 make ro. 
Write the 4 in the answer in tens’ place.” It is evident, 
therefore, that none but the most superficial observers will 
use this argument. 
_ The first argument seems sound, but some recent results
-P-A-G-E-136
126 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
indicate that children who have been taught by the Aus- 
trian method cannot subtract any better than those taught 
in the ordinary way.! Until further evidence is forth- 
coming, we must conclude that we are not justified in 
abandoning the old method. 
Question 4. How shall borrowing in subtraction be 
taught? 
Two methods have been widely used. In one case you 
subtract what is borrowed from the next figure in the min- 
uend; in the other you add one to the next figure in the 
subtrahend. The main argument for the first method is 
that it prevents children from having to think of addition 
when they subtract. This is said to be a simplification of 
the task and therefore desirable. The method of sub- 
traction throughout causes trouble, however, in cases like 
10000 
7819" 
subtractions before he can say 9 from ro leaves 1. He 
must then remember that instead of having 1000 left in 
his minuend, he has 999. This is extremely difficult for 
many children, as is shown in the frequency of error in this 
sort of exercise. 
The practice of adding what is borrowed to the subtra- 
hend avoids trouble with zeros in the minuend, but it 
tends to complicate matters by mixing addition with sub- 
traction. f 
Both methods are open to objection from the moralist. 
In the first you borrow and fail to pay back, while in the 
second you pay back what has really not been borrowed. 
The argument of the moralists is utterly worthless, how- 
ever, because it is based upon a totally erroneous concep- 
tion of childhood. Children are not little adults. At the 
1 Mead, Cyrus D., and Sears, Isabel, ‘‘Additive Subtraction and Multiplica- 
tive Division Tested.” Journal of Educational Psychology, 7: 261-70. Here the child has to go through a series of four
-P-A-G-E-137
  PRINCIPLES OF METHOD 127 
age when they are taught to “ borrow,” they are quite un- 
able to sense the subtle logic of the situation. Little 
children who feel glorified when they ride a stick horse or 
who revel in dolls with cracked heads or no heads at all 
are not going to be corrupted or morally injured in the 
least through the use of “ borrowing” in subtraction. 
For this reason no apology is offered for use of the terms 
“ borrow ” and “ pay back ” in this book. They are not 
logical or moral in the strictest sense, but they are well 
known by all and quite satisfactory from a practical point 
of view. - 
The conclusion is that, as in the case of adding upward 
and downward, neither side can ‘claim any great advan- 
tage. The same is true also concerning the question of 
whether in carrying one should write what is to be carried 
at the top or at the bottom of the next column. One 
thing, however, is true and extremely important. Be con- 
sistent in what you do. If you start one of these methods, 
carry it through. Use the same method used by your 
predecessor on all doubtful points as far as the same chil- 
dren are concerned. Children who have partly learned 
one method of procedure should rarely if ever be taught 
another method by the next teacher. It is better to use 
a poor method well than two good methods poorly. 
Question 5. When should the tables of addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication, and division be taught as such? 
The answer is, “ Not at all.” The number facts can 
never be used in the order in which they occur in the tables. 
Tables are merely summaries of what has been learned. 
They are of value as a means of remembering what has been 
learned. They are useless as methods of learning. If 
used at all, they should come in at the end of the third 
grade as a means of summarizing what has been learned.

  CHAPTER IX 
GAMES AND DEVICES 
Tue teacher who wishes to improve her work through cor- 
rective arithmetic will use an inventory test to find out 
just what she needs to teach. She will then strive to teach 
what is needed through the use of the best possible: meth- 
ods. It has been shown that connections made in com- 
pany with vivid and pleasant feelings are more permanent 
and more likely to be practiced spontaneously. Vivid 
and pleasant feelings are always associated with the exer- 
cise of some fundamental instinct. The desire to excel 
and the tendency to play are fundamental and wide- 
spread instincts in almost every child. It is very desir- 
able, therefore, to tie up the child’s number work with 
these instinctive tendencies. Two dangers, however, 
must be avoided. The play or contest element in the 
game must not be too highly organized for the little 
children or too infantile for the larger ones. 
GaMES 
Games and devices for use with number work are plenti- 
ful on the market. No teacher needs all of them. There- 
fore every teacher must select the ones which she proposes 
to use. Some are much better than others. The purpose 
of this chapter is to list and describe those which have 
been found most useful by school supervisors in Wiscon- 
sin.’ Both rural and city supervisors were asked to list 
five games which they had found most useful in the teach- 
ing of primary number. Two hundred and thirteen games 
were mentioned including repetitions. The types of

Racing games. An inspection of the above data shows 
that games involving a race of some sort are used more 
frequently than any other type. The race element is in- 
troduced in a variety of ways. A very common form is 
to write the combinations in a long row if presented in the 
column form or in a column if presented in equation form. 
Two children start at opposite ends of the column or row 
at a given signal and call answers as fast as possible. The 
purpose of the game is to see which child can get to the 
center first. In using this device the same two children 
should reverse their positions and call the answers again 
because one half of the column or row may be more diffi- 
cult than the other half. If a different child wins each 
time, the result should be called a tie. 
Children get tired of the same game played all the time. 
It is necessary, therefore, that the teacher have in mind 
numerous variations. A small variation in the setting of 
a good game will revive the interest of the children re- 
markably. For example, let each child call the answers” 
to all the combinations in the row or column. Keep
-P-A-G-E-141
  GAMES AND DEVICES 131 
time for each one by observing the second hand of your 
watch. The winner is the child who does the required 
work in the shortest time. If either of the children makes 
a mistake, the teacher says, “ That is too bad. You 
didn’t know how much (giving the name of the com- 
binations missed) are. You will have to study a little 
more on —— (naming the combinations missed) before 
you can win in this game.” For these exercises absolute 
accuracy should be the standard for winning. Maintain 
this standard if you can, but do not bore the children in 
order to do so. 
Children in the second grade enjoy a variation of this 
game in which the teacher runs along with her finger just 
behind the combinations whose answers the child is nam- 
ing, saying, “ Hurry, or I’ll catch you,” “ Don’t let me 
win,” and the like. 
Young children enjoy playing at picking the apples 
before the frost comes, gathering in the clothes before the 
rain, rescuing the guests from the burning hotel, and the 
like. Of course, the apples, articles of clothing, guests, 
etc., are the particular combinations which each child 
needs to practice. The worst objection to the last game 
is the drawing of the apple tree, clothesline, etc., which 
must be done by the teacher before the game begins. 
The drawing is worth while, however, particularly when 
the teacher has some facility at it. 
The games so far listed have been of the individual 
type. They are particularly useful among little children. 
In the upper grades, say from the fourth up, group games 
become more and more useful. For the group games, two 
leaders are appointed who “ choose up,” thus dividing the 
school or class into two groups. A representative from 
each group is selected to take part in each race. The dif- 
ferent races or “ events’ vary in character. A common  
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 CORRECTIVE. ARITHMETIC 
type is the circle game. Suppose, for example, that the 
teacher wishes to give practice in the more difficult higher 
decade additions given on page 164 of this book. The 
number 19 may be written in the center of a circle while 
the numbers o to g inclusive are written in mixed order 
around the edge. Two circles of this sort are provided. 
They may be joined to form a bicycle. A child is chosen 
for each circle and both start calling or writing sums at a 
given signal. The score may be either the number correct 
or the time required to give a set of entirely correct an- 
swers. The score for each event is added to see who wins 
the “meet.” For the next pair of children the require- 
ments may be changed by merely substituting another 
number for the number 19. The same device can be 
adapted to the teaching of any of the combinations where 
the first number is always the same. 
There are many other group games which permit the 
use of entirely different combinations each time. An 
example of these is the ladder game. Two ladders are 
drawn with combinations for rungs. Two children 
“climb ” the two ladders by giving the answer to each 
combination starting from the bottom. The scoring is 
the same as that for the circles. 
Another device — one which will interest little children 
— is to make two series of circles on the floor representing 
stones. Two pupils then attempt to “ wade the brook.” 
If they miss a combination, they have fallen into the 
water. Another form of discomfort when a combination 
is missed is the requirement that the child who missed the 
combination step back two steps. Any of these games 
may be used in relay form, thus securing drill for every 
child in the group when his turn comes. The total score 
for the group is the sum of the scores made by the individ- 
uals composing it.
-P-A-G-E-143
GAMES AND DEVICES 133 
The use of the inventory tests as practice exercises has 
already been mentioned. Standards of speed and accu- 
racy are available in the Courtis Manual ? and in many of 
the newer textbooks. The pupils can thus measure them- 
selves in time and accuracy against each other as individ- 
uals, or as groups, or against the standard scores. 
Another very helpful device is to keep the daily scores 
so that each child can measure himself against his own past 
record. This allows the slowest pupil a chance. If he 
can’t beat any one else, he can at least beat himself. 
Post-office game. Another type of game is used quite 
widely by the supervisors who reported to us. One of its 
forms is known as “ the post-office game.” A large num- 
ber of cards with combinations on them are given to the 
child who is to be the postman or the postmaster. If it 
is the postman, he puts his cards in a satchel or some sort 
of container and passes down the aisles. Each child has 
a number for a name. Suppose, for example, the post- 
man comes to a child whose name is eight. All of the com- 
binations which have an answer eight are his letters and 
should be left with him by the postman. Thus the same 
395 
child might get the “letters” 8 X 1, +5 —7 48+ 6, 
4 of 16, and so on. If a “ postmaster ” is appointed, the 
children go to his office for their mail. It will add to the 
interest if the teacher calls herself the government inspec- 
tor. It is her work to check up the postman or post- 
master. She may appoint deputy inspectors among the 
children with the understanding that when she stands at 
a certain place in the room, the children are to play as if 
she were not there at all. At such times all understand

that a deputy isin charge. The penalty fora mistake on’ 
the part of the postmaster, postman, or deputy is a tem- 
porary suspension from office because “‘ The people had 
letters in the mail and you couldn’t find them. We shall 
have to get some one who can really hold this job down.” 
The “I am thinking” game. In another form of the 
game the teacher or some pupil says, “I am thinking of 
two numbers whose sum is so and so.”’ Some other child 
is required to name two such numbers. Other statements 
used with the “ I am thinking ” game are: “ I am think- 
ing of two numbers which give seven when subtracted ” ; 
“Tam thinking of two numbers which give fifty-four when 
multiplied ”; “ I am thinking of two numbers which give 
six when one is divided by the other”; and soon. Any 
correct response may be counted or the teacher may allow 
the class to keep on guessing until some child hits upon 
the actual pair of numbers in the mind of the questioner. 
The last device is helpful in locating children who make in- 
correct guesses. 
There is some argument pro and con concerning the 
value of the “ post-office ” and “I am thinking.” The 
objection is that much of the practice is given in an 
indirect manner. The children start with the answers 
and work backwards. ‘This, of course, is seldom true in 
life. Thus the drill is being given in a form in which it 
will not be used. 
On the other hand, there are great advantages. The 
most important thing of all is that the children like the 
games very much and actually do become proficient in 
their number work by means of them. It is claimed that 
since the correct answer or response is the aim, we should 
present it first in order to take advantage of the principle 
that first connections are more permanent. It is also 
argued that this form of drill offers a very useful method   
    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-145
GAMES AND DEVICES 135 
of classifying combinations. In subtraction, for example, 
there are ten combinations which yield the answer 9, ten 
which yield the answer 8, and so on, including the much- 
neglected ten which give the answer zero. It is said to be 
advantageous to learning when the groups are thus con- 
stituted. The weight of the argument undoubtedly 
favors the use of these games. Some loss results, but the 
gain much more than compensates for it. 
Two types of games have been discussed thus far. The 
racing games are for the purpose of developing speed, while 
the post-office and “ I am thinking ” games aim chiefly at 
accuracy. The chief characteristic of all speed drills is the 
element of time pressure. They should never be used 
until accuracy is well established. Many of the games 
and devices used for the development of accuracy may be 
used as speed drills by the mere limitation of the time ele- 
ment. The group contest plan can, of course, be used in 
connection with the exercises in the textbook. A repre- 
sentative from each side begins working simultaneously 
on the same exercise. As he finishes, he erases his work, 
takes his seat, and another pupil from his side comes for- 
ward and starts to work on the next exercise. If one of 
the contestants makes a mistake, he has to find it himself. 
While he is looking for it, all the other pupils on his side 
are impatiently watching him and urging him on. Such 
a situation may prove very valuable. The rest of his 
group get some useful practice in self-control; while he 
himself experiences a pronounced sense of discomfort, the 
memory of which will be a source of no small amount of 
motivation for his future work. 
One extremely important caution must be observed 
with this device, however. The child who delays his side 
must always be made to know just what combinations 
caused his trouble. If this caution is not observed, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
whole device breaks down and may even become posi- 
tively pernicious. 
Card games. A third type of game or device is the use 
of cards upon which the several combinations are listed. 
The cards may be used in connection with the develop- 
ment of both speed and accuracy. Their greatest value, 
however, is as a means of presenting and fixing new com- 
binations for the first eight or ten times. Their use in 
connection with the post-office idea has already been dis- 
cussed. The latter game cannot be played, however, 
until a considerable amount of practice has been given 
with other forms of card drill. The cards are a conven- 
ient sv cener ora presenting the combinations at the very 
beginning.“ The teacher selects three cards which show 
the first three combinations to be taught. Some of the 
children will know the answers already. Have the an- 
swers given and see to it that each child gets some practice 
innaming them. The combinations may be written on the 
blackboard and the class may take turns in coming to the 
board, pointing to each combination, and giving the cor- 
rect answer. If a child misses a combination, he should 
be made aware of that fact and a record made showing 
which combination was missed. Another form of drill 
with the three cards is the flashing of each card before 
each child in turn. A limited use may be made of re- 
sponses in concert. A great difficulty with this method is 
the tendency of the class to depend upon one or two bright 
pupils for their responses. The wide-awake teacher will 
soon detect the well-known echo effect which this sort of 
response produces. To offset this, some teachers request 
the quick pupils to “ hide their eyes ” or stay out of the 
game for a while. This is rather hard on the best pupils 
and may operate as a punishment for correct responses 
and thus violate the law of effect. A better procedure is to
-P-A-G-E-147
  GAMES AND DEVICES 137 
have correct responses from groups of the class. Even at 
best the concert type of procedure is of doubtful value. 
After the class period on the first day, the children may 
begin to use the cards as seat work. The children are 
requested to think of the answer to each combination and 
prove that their answer is correct by means of pasteboard 
squares or other objects. 
The mastery of the combinations is distinctly a process 
of habit formation. This necessitates many short prac- 
tices with intervening periods. No teacher can expect 
her pupils to remember the three combinations presented 
on the first day unless further practice is given. For this 
reason it is advisable to teach the same three combina- 
tions the next day along with three new ones introduced 
in the same manner as in the case of the original three. It 
is a good plan to keep the original three combinations for 
about five days. Thus, if the work starts on Monday, 
the three combinations introduced on that day will be 
practiced every day of that week. On the following 
Monday they will not be practiced. On Tuesday the 
three combinations which were first presented on the pre- 
ceding Tuesday will be omitted, and so on. The amount 
of drill for the first week will therefore be: Monday, three 
new combinations; Tuesday, the same three with three 
new ones; Wednesday, the six old combinations and three 
new ones; Thursday, thénine old combinations and three 
new ones; and Friday, the twelve old combinations and 
three newones. From this point on, the practice material 
will consist of fifteen combinations. Each day three old 
ones will be dropped and three new ones added. Each 
combination that is dropped will have been practiced for 
five days in succession. This process should be kept up 
until all the new combinations for the grade or half-grade 
1See page 74.
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
have been practiced for five days in succession. In the 
meantime these combinations must be practiced in as 
many other games and with as many other devices as pos- 
sible in order to prevent forgetting. 
After combinations or number facts have been presented 
for two or three days in class, there are many seat-work 
devices which may be used to provide further drill. A 
few samples of useful seat work will be briefly described. 
According to one plan, each child is provided with cards 
bearing all the combinations which have been learned — 
also with cards bearing all the answers. The child is re- 
quired to match the answer with the corresponding com- 
bination. Even before combinations are taught, cards 
‘may be used as seat work. For example, one set of cards 
may show in printed form the words, “ one,” “ two,” 
“three,” etc.; another set the corresponding Arabic 
numerals; another the Roman numerals; and still an- 
other the corresponding dots. These cards may be pre- 
sented in chance order. The child’s task is to match the 
cards properly. Further seat work is suggested on page 
141. 
There are numerous other games that may be played 
with cards by the class as a whole. Second-grade chil- 
dren like to play “street car.” The chairs are so ar- 
ranged as to represent a street car. The children sit in the 
chairs and each child has a card upon which a combina- 
tion is written. The conductor comes along to collect 
the fare. The children pay their fares by naming the 
combination which they have. The game “ pussie wants 
a corner ” can be adapted to number work by means of 
cards. A combination card is fastened in each corner of 
the room. A child stands in each corner. The child who 
is “it ’ runs about trying to displace some one who has a 
corner. This may be done by beating some one to the
-P-A-G-E-149
GAMES AND DEVICES 139 
corner when the children change places. It is under- 
stood, too, that no one is allowed to occupy a corner who is 
found to be unable to give the combination in that corner. 
The person who is “ it ” may always get a corner by nam- 
ing the combination in the corner before the child who is 
already in the corner can name it. In “hunting” the 
children search about the schoolroom or in the yard for 
combination cards and are allowed to keep all they find. 
The games “ grab-bag ” and “ fishing ” are quite similar, 
yet different enough to prevent monotony. 
Playing store. A fourth type of game represented in 
the results of the questionnaire is that which is for the pur- 
pose of supplying the children with the experiences which 
are prerequisite to abstract number work and arithmetical 
reasoning. ‘‘ Playing store”? was mentioned most fre- 
quently. The articles in the store should be represented 
by pictures and there should be plenty of toy money of all 
the common denominations. Credit accounts may be 
kept with certain definite periods for paying up. Plenty 
of opportunities for making and receiving change should 
be provided. The characteristic of this type of game is 
the fact that the children play at real life situations in 
which the number element is an essential. 
Baseball. “A fifth type of game is that in which the 
number work is artificially attached to some game in com- 
mon use in the community. This type was represented 
most frequently in the questionnaire by the game of base- 
ball. There are several ways to play the game. The 
following is a sample: 
The room is divided into two teams. One team is at 
bat; the other is in the field. The catcher stands in one 
corner of the room with the first, second, and third base- 
men in the other corners. The pitcher stands near the 
center of the room. The remainder of the group are 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
140 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
fielders. The batter is, of course, a representative of the 
other side. He stands just in front of the catcher facing 
the pitcher. The teacher is the umpire. She decides 
disputes, calls strikes, and furnishes the pitcher with balls. 
The pitcher throws a ball by asking the batter to give the 
answer to a certain combination. He may use his judg- 
ment (within the limits set by the umpire) concerning 
what combination he shall use upon the batter. The bat- 
ter must answer three successive combinations correctly 
in order to score one for his side. If the batter misses, 
the umpire calls, “ strike one,” and the combination goes 
to the catcher, pitcher, first, second, and third basemen 
and then to any of the fielders who can give it. If no one 
answers correctly, the batter continues, but if some one 
“ catches him out ” another batter takes his place and so 
on until there are three outs after which the two teams 
reverse their positions. 
Any teacher who uses games of this type will soon be- 
come convinced that the children are interested. The 
danger is that the play element may entirely obscure the 
educational value. For this reason it would seeem pref- 
erable to limit somewhat the use of this sort of game. 
Games for use out of school. A sixth type of game is 
worth mentioning, although it occurred rarely in the re- 
sults of the questionnaire. It is the type which is most 
likely to carry over into vacation time and thus provide at 
least some practice in number work while school is not in 
session. Hopscotch and dominoes have already been 
mentioned as examples of this class. Dominoes can also 
be played to advantage by pairs of children, even while 
school is in session. Usually, in order to score, the child 
must play so as to make the ends of the line of blocks add 
up to some multiple of five. Multiples of other numbers 
may, however, be used. The doubles are to be placed 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  
  GAMES AND DEVICES 141 
crosswise so as to form bases for side lines of blocks. With 
two ends to the main line and one end of each of several 
side lines a great deal of practice in addition and subtrac- | 
tion can be provided. 
Practice TESTS 
In addition to the games and devices suggested above, 
every teacher should have the use of one of the practice 
tests now on the market. Their purpose is to provide 
suitable practice material under scientific conditions. 
They also provide useful standards in speed and accuracy. 
The Courtis! exercises were constructed to make these 
standards available. The Studebaker? exercises are very 
similar, but they are presented in a form which is preferred 
by many. The Osburn exercises are for the purpose of 
supplementing certain deficiencies in the older material 
based upon the notion that direct teaching of ail the use- 
ful combinations is essential. 
Seat Work 
One further type of practice deserves more attention 
than has yet been given-to it. All teachers, and particu- 
larly all rural teachers, are sadly in need of suitable seat 
work for their pupils. In recent years it has been recog- 
nized that pupils can learn a great deal by themselves if 
the material is presented in the proper form. This is glad 
tidings for teachers in one-room rural schools and for 
teachers whose rooms are crowded. There is a pressing

-P-A-G-E-152
  142 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
demand for an improved technique in the presentation of 
seat work. This demand is very much strengthened by 
another factor of tremendous importance. An improved 
technique in seat work is the most promising relief from 
the grade system with its intolerable lock step. If a pro- 
cedure can be provided by which the child can learn by 
himself — even in spite of a poor teacher — the way will 
begin to open so that the bright child can be required to 
work at least hard enough to “ stretch the traces taut,” 
and the slow pupils can proceed comfortably and without 
fear of derision or unfavorable comparison. There is no 
greater need in American instruction to-day than for 
some means of individualizing instruction. An improved 
technique in seat work represents the best hope of improve- 
ment in this respect. The problem has been attacked in 
Winnetka, Illinois, in Los Angeles, California, and in Wis- 
consin. The results in Wisconsin are still in the formative 
stage, but one or two things have been proved quite defi- 
nitely in all three localities. 
First, better seat work is needed in all subjects. Since 
time is limited and since the principle of correlation of sub- 
ject matter is well established, there is no objection to 
providing copies of seat work relating to more than one 
subject. Experience has shown that arithmetic seat 
work can be given to advantage in connection with silent- 
reading seat work. Second, the busy teacher needs to 
have in her possession a number of copies of seat-work 
material each carrying its own set of written directions. 
Thus equipped, all that she has to do is to pass out the 
cards. Third, the work must be provided in such form 
that it can be very easily scored or graded. Busy teach- 
ers must be relieved from the drudgery of grading compli- 
cated seat work. Fourth, the exercises for seat work must 
be'appropriately graded in difficulty and the teacher must
-P-A-G-E-153
GAMES AND DEVICES 143 
know what exercises to use with each child, how long to 
use each one, and in what order to use them. 
Finally, each card must carry, so far as possible, its own 
motivation. It must have its own particular purpose and 
the child must be made conscious of this purpose as a spe- 
cific goal which he is to attain. He must be made to un- 
derstand that as soon as he has reached a suitable profi- 
ciency on one card he is to proceed to the next. The dis- 
cerning reader will at once see that this leads directly into 
the heart of both curriculum reorganization and educa- 
tional psychology. What is the relative value of subject 
matter? What are the bonds or connections which should 
be formed? When should they be formed and in what 
order? These are big questions and no one can answer 
them fully until a great deal more research work has 
been done in physiological, psychological, educational, and 
social fields. The exercises which follow are in a very 
crude form. Their gradation is extremely tentative as 
yet. The need is so great and the demand so insistent, 
however, that even crude ungraded exercises are worth 
considering until further improvements are possible.

Some children try to solve their problems without knowing 
what they are going to do. Are you one of these? Each of 
these problems has add, subtract, multiply, divide after it. 
One of the words tells the right thing to do. Write on your 
tablet the word which tells the right thing to do in each prob- 
lem. Do not work the problem.

Lack of space prevents the giving of more than a few 
samples of seat-work devices here. It is hoped, however, 
that enough has been presented to enable the teacher to 
make up similar devices of her own. They are particularly 
needed as corrective exercises to meet the type errors of 
the class. 
The whole process of corrective arithmetic may be 
summed up in these words: Find what needs to be taught 
in your grade and what should have been taught in pre- 
vious grades. Give an inventory test based on the work 
of the previous grades. Note the errors and the names of 
the children who make them. Plan your class and seat 
work on the basis of what the children need. Busy 
teachers will have to rely to a large extent on the seat 
work. For this type of work it is hardly possible to have 
too much material. The material must be in such form 
that it may be used by the children with a minimum of
-P-A-G-E-160
150 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
help from the teacher. Clear directions and a definite 
means of scoring are essential. Finally it is very essential 
for every teacher to understand that the devices for seat 
work are of no value on the pages of a book. They must 
be available in loose-leaf or card form. Until the seat 
exercises are published in this form it will be necessary to 
obtain the copies in some other manner. Many teachers 
are mimeographing or multigraphing them. When the 
copies are made, they should be put into such form that 
the teacher may keep them for use in future years. Seat 
work is the capsheaf of the corrective process. Without 
it all of the efforts spent in testing and diagnosing will be 
like grain which withers away before it ripens.

  CHAPTER X 
SUMMARY 
Tue salient points-which have resulted from the studies 
described in this book are: (1) the new meaning which old 
principles of teaching take on in the light of recent educa- 
tional research ; (2) the futility of our naive faith in trans- 
fer of training; (3) a clearer notion of just what is to be 
taught — its difficulty and importance socially; (4) the 
natureand causes of errors; (5) the inadequacy of available 
practice material; (6) the technique of educational diag- 
nosis; (7) the identification and order of bonds to be 
formed; and (8) the use of educational inventories. 
Renewed emphasis has been placed upon the old prin- 
ciples of teaching because they are fundamental and will 
continue to be guides in our future progress. Whenever 
we learn how to teach just a little better, with just a little 
less effort, we remove just that much friction from our ed- 
ucational machinery and the art and pleasure of teaching 
is accordingly enhanced. The breakdown of our former 
unconscious faith in transfer results in a large increase in. 
the number of combinations to be taught. This does not 
necessarily mean an increase in the teacher’s labor, how- 
ever. We shall in a large measure rid ourselves of that 
notorious thorn in the flesh which has resulted from the 
presence in the class of a number of children whose condi- 
tion is hopeless. For them the transfer did not take 
place. Transfer is closely related to the power to infer, 
and this in turn is a function of native intelligence. The 
slower children cannot make correct inferences. What- 
ever is taught them must be taught directly. This is 
I5r
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 CORRECTIVE ARITHMETIC 
work for the teacher, but it is infinitely better than striv- 
ing to teach by a method which is hopeless. 
The teacher’s burden will be lightened also because she 
will have a clearer idea of the end to be reached. The 
mere knowledge of just which combinations are to be 
taught will save a large amount of labor for the teacher 
and of hopelessness for the child. 
Teaching will become more expert and therefore more 
satisfying when the teacher knows the nature and causes 
of errors, when she is master of the technique of educa- 
tional diagnosis, and when she has a clear notion of just 
what supplementary practice material is needed. We 
shall no longer permit little children to suffer from the dis- 
couragement which comes when they are expected to know 
that which is not to be found in their textbooks. We 
shall no longer compel them to encounter difficulties for 
which they have not been prepared. 
In our teaching we shall proceed from the simple to the 
complex with an insight and wisdom which has not been 
known heretofore. Finally, we shall put teaching on a 
sound basis by making a careful inventory of just what 
each child already knows and just what he is expected to 
learn.

Devised by WortH J. OsBuRN 
Directions to be read by teacher and pupils together : 
The exercises on this page are arranged in the form of a ladder. 
Sometimes you think you have gotten to the top when you have 
not. Wrong answers do not count. See if you can climb the 
ladder. The examples get more difficult as you go up. Begin 
at the bottom and work upward. Watch your step and don’t get 
dizzy. Put all of your work on this sheet. Do not check your 
work, but when you have finished, ask your teacher to read the 
correct answers. Put crosses in the ladder to show how high you 
have climbed before you made a mistake. You can climb no 
higher than your first mistake.

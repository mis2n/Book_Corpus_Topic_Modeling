CHAPTER I. 
         CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Relative importance of city school systems (Table 1)—Comparison of city and country schools 
(Lables 2 and 3)—Comparative statistics for four years of all cities reported (Table 4\—Com- 
parative statistics of enrollment, attendance, teachers, and accommodations in the city schools of 
the several States (Table 5)—Comparative statistics of property and expenditures of the same 
(Zable 6)—Number and, population, by States, of cities, etc., of over 4,000 inhabitants (Table 
7)—Explanation of the same—Summary, by States, of school enroliment and attendance in the 
same cities (Table 8)—Similar summary of supervising officers, teachers, property, and expendi- tures (Table 9)-—Similar summary of public high schools (Table 10)—Similar summary of pub- 
lic evening schools (able 11). : 
           
            
     The tables immediately following (i. e., Nos. 1, 2,and 3) are designed to indicate “A 
the differences in the conditions of work that exist between the city schools and : 
those of rural districts. The tables are self explanatory, and even a cursory ex- 
amination will disclose the importance of the facts they develop. A few of these 
may be mentioned. the 
Though 32.39 per cent of the total population isin the cities, only 23.43 per cent of 
the enrollmentisin city schools. This isapparently an indication that education 
is apprecia‘ed more highly in the country and that, though school attendance 
is surrounded by greater difficulties, country children more eagerly accept the . 
advantages offered. The attendance is more regular in cities, as would naturally 
be expected. owing to the greater distance as a rule that must be traversed by 
country pupils and the better highways in the cities. 
In the length of the school term rural schools are at a great disadvantage and 
the same is true of the average duration of each child’s attendance. These may 
arise from the more meager-financial support accorded torural schools andfrom ~ 
the exigencies of farm life which demand the services of the older children for 
a great part of each year. 
The number of teachers is relatively very small in the cities, and the number 
of buildings required for city schools appears insignificant until their greater 
size and value are considered. 
The slight difference that exists between the average cost per day of tuition 
for each pupil is significant and might readily serve as a text for a lesson on the 
meagerness of the pay of country school teachers, for there are nearly twice as 2 
many ptpils to each téacher in the city schools. " 
On the other hand, may it not be that the greater proportionate enrollment 
in the country is atleast partially due to the smaller number of pupils to a 
teacher and cpaseuonty: the more intimate personal relation that exists ba- 
tween teacher and pupil? 
Tables 5 and 6 are similar to others that have appeared in the Reports of the 
three years previous, and in Table 4 are reproduced for comparison some of the 
ratios shown in those tables. The data presented do not cover sufficient time to 
form the bases for any important general conclusions. The method of keeping 
school statistics and the manner of collecting them are yet far from perfect, 
and a variation of a few tenths of a per cent affords no ground for startling 
assertions of progress or the reverse. Such conclusions may be justly reached 
only after the appearance of marked differences or a series of changes in the 4 
same general direction covering a considerable number of years. 
For several years past there has been a desire on the part of those int-rested 
in the preparation of these statistics to present a series of tables showing with

reasonable accuracy the absolute totals of the several items for the entire Union. 
The first result of this was presented in the last Report, and similar tables are 
also included in this chapter as Nos. 8, 9, 10, and 11. 
‘To prepare such tables it is first essential to perfect a list of cities of which all 
shall meet certain uniform conditions. This itself is very difficult even with the 
census reports at hand. Table 7, with the accompanying explanation, indicates 
some of the perplexities encountered. In the years other than census years the 
difficulties are of course multiplied, since dependence must be placed almost 
wholly upon local estimates. 
‘Then, having the list of cities, the collection of complete statistics involves a 
task almost hopeless. Many cities fail to report every year, and in the returns 
-of many more severalof the most importantitems are omitted. As before ex- 
plained, estimates were necessary to make good the deficiencies. The correc- 
tions and additions that the circumstances indicated having been made, the 
tables as they now stand are presumably fairly correct.

EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE FOREGOING TABLE. 
The difference between the list of ‘ places” of over 4,000 inhabitants presente 
in Bulletin-No. 165 of the United States Census Office and the list of “‘ cities an 
villages” used in the compilation of the tables of this chapter may be explaine: 
as follows: 
First. The population of the cities of Owego, N. Y., Evanston, Ill., and Salem, 
Oregon, was not separately reported by the enumerators of their respectiv 
localities. Consequently these cities were not included in the list of places i 
the census bulletin mentioned. All three cities are undoubtedly of the popu: 
lation requisite for representation in these tables; their school statistics ar 
reported in due form, and no reason is apparent why they should not b 
inserted. The population assigned to them is estimated, the estimates being 
based principally upon the population in 1880 and the rate of increase of the 
several townships of which they are parts. : 
Second. The differences which appear in the figures for the six New England| 
States require more extended notice, since the school data here presented will] 
be used in comparison with similar items in future years, and it is important 
that persons so using them shall be in no doubt as to what the figures represent. 
In New England, as it_is well-known, the methods of local government are 
peculiar. Counties exist, but for judicial purposes only; in nearly all other matters| 
what is there known as the ‘“‘town system” prevails. The entire territory is 
divided into towns, which correspond in a measure to the western townships, but] 
with the important difference that the New England towns are independent of the| 
county in all matters of local concern. Villages in the towns are not recognized 
in the system and do not even have their boundaries defined. <A ‘‘town” is made} 
a city by simply changing the plan of government from a pure democracy to a 
representative form, This may be done when the people desire the change| 
and the legislature sanctions it, after certain conditions have been reached, 
as, in Massachusetts for example, when the population is as great as 12,000. 
‘The average area of the towns in Massachusetts is approximately 23 square 
miles; in Rhode Island, 30; in Connecticut, 29; in Maine, 60; in Vermont and 
New Hampshire, 38. 
It is plain, therefore, that there are many towns in which a population of sev- 
eral thousand is so scattered over a large territory as to deprive them of every 
aspect of urban communities. Then, too, some of the ‘‘cities” consist of several 
distinct villages, between which original forests or agricultural lands still remain, 
although in most.cases the incorporated cities are uniformly and thickly set- 
tled, and do not differ materially from cities in other parts of the country. But 
there are no boundaries recognized. excepting those of the counties and towns 
or cities, organized as before explained; and the custom prevalent in that sec- 
tion of never considering the village apart from the town in official matters, evi- 
dently had its effect upon the census officials, for with a few exceptions they 
made no mention of the villages in their figures of population. 
There is great difficulty, therefore, in making from such data a tabular state- 
mentof urban population in New England which will substantially correspond 
with the conditions elsewhere. Only two methods of dealing with the problem 
seem possible: First, disregard the great territorial extent of the “towns” and 
place them in the same category with the cities and villages of other sections; 
second, investigate the character of the population of the several towns, consid- 
ering each one separately, and from the best data available make as close an esti- 
mate as possible of the urban population. 
The first method was adoptet by the census authorities in this city. It has 
the advantage of displaying no figures except those obtained by an actual count 
of something; but its disadvantage is obvious, since it makes the urban popula- 
tion appear to be far greater than it isin fact. 
This method is particularly unsatisfactory in the matter of school statistics. 
‘City school systems” are essentially those of dense settlements. The schools 
in rural, or sparsely settl2d, districts form a class entirely different in organiza- 
tion, in methods, and, as a rule, in results. It becomes important, therefore, to 
separate them as far as possible. Asthis could not be done under the classifi- 
cation of the Census Office the second method of obtaining the list of “ cities” 
_ was adopted, although it involved the use of estimates in many cases. 
The following may be given as the principal means by which the fitness or 
unfitness for these tables of individual localities was determined: = 
First. When a town was shown to contain more or less rural or scattered 
population, and a single village or borough whose population was exactly stated, 
or could be approximately determined from the schcol census or otherwise, the
-P-A-G-E-19
    
       
CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 611 
town was disregarded and the village or borough was cohsidered with sole ref- 
erence to its own population. Cases of this kind arose principally in Connecti- 
cut and Vermont. 
Second. When the only school statistics to be had were for the town as a 
whole, and it appeared that the town was composed wholly of a city or large 
village with its environs or ‘‘suburbs,” as in the case of New Britain, Conn., the 
population of the town was used in preference to that of the city alone. This 
was necessary to make the figures of population correspond in area with the 
school data, and is in accordance with the general practice of including more or 
less of contiguous territory in the corporate limits of a city. 
» Third. When a town contains several distinct villages with separate interests, 
none of which had as many as 4,000 inhabitants, all were discarded, though tie 
population of the entire town may have been a great deal more than the mini- 
mum limit. But when one of the villages evidently contained the required 
population that village was included in the list, with an estimate as accurate as 
may be of its population. Warwick, R. I., is an instance of the first class, and 
Lincoln, R. I., containing Central Falls, of the second class. 
Fourth. When nothing definite could be determined concerning the villages 
in a town the population of the town as compared with its area as shown by the 
maps was taken as an indication of the density of its population, and conse- 
quently of the fitness of the town for use in the tables. But in all such cases 
the organization of the schools shown by the reports of the school committees 
was considered, for in New England small schools almost invariably indicate   
spar: 
was © population. 
   Tn Massachusetts, and in some instances in other States, it 
necessary to accept or discard each town as a whole according to these 
guides, which, it must be admitted, were by no means satisfactory. * 
It is to be remembered that the list as it stands is not claimed to be a perfec 
one, and persons ‘with an intimate knowledge of the several localities may de- 
. tect flaws in the conclusions reached regarding them; if so, any suggestion in 
relation thereto will be gladly accepted. 
The following shows in detail the instances of difference between the Census 
Office tables and those of this chapter so far as they relate to New England:

had in any particular case, an estimate based upon the ratios developed in the other cities of the a 
same State was used unless it appeared that the conditions were essentially different inthecity 
for which. precise data were lacking. 
Blanks in the tables indicate that the number of cities which reported the item was not suf- 
ficient to justify an assumption of approximate correctness in an estimate for the deficiency, ; *

It is now about.a decade since the first organized effort was made to cause all — 
chool pupils to be taught the laws of health and in that connection the publi 
evil effects of alcoholic beverages, tobacco and other narcotics; that their use 
in whatever degree is dangerous because of their power to create an uncontroll- 
able appetite for mo: that the indulgence of such an appetite is unqualifiedly    
  detrimental to the physical and moral ‘woll- ‘being of man; and that the only safe 
“course to pursue with regard to these substances is one of total abstinence. 
HISTORICAL SKETCH. 2 
This movement was started by Mrs. Mary H. Hunt,’ through the Woman's 
   sor or teacher of ‘chemistry in am eastern college had led to her assuming 
practical oversight of the education of her only child, who was a student in — 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1872 to 1876,“ ‘While thus en- 
gaged,” she says, ‘‘the question concerning alcohol as a chemical reagent led 
to inquiry as to its origin, nature, and effects upon the human system as found 
in the popular alcoholic beverages. This study became an absorbing research 
that filled me with alarm for the future of a nation whose people were consum- 
ing such vast quantities of aleohol.” 
‘As a result of this study the conviction was forced upon her ‘that intemper- — 
ance could never be prevented until people were taught the real nature and 
effects of alcoholic drinks, and that this must be done through the schools.” 
The National Temperance Publication Society of New ¥1 made several tenta- 
tive movements in that direction, principally under the direétion of Miss Julia — 
Coleman, whose Juvenile Temperance Manual, published in’ 1878, was Salis 
quently introduesd into a few public schools. 
The town of Hyde Park, Mass., at the instigation of Mrs. Hunt, was the first 
to introduce the study of scientific temperance into its public school curriculum, — ian Temperance Union. The previous experience of Mrs. Hunt as a pro- - 
No suitable text-book had been prepared, and for the time being use was made 
of ne Temperance Lesson Book, written by Dr. B, W. Richardson (London, 
1887), 
Action of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union.—The first official action of ~ 
the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union was taken, in response to Mrs. Hunt’s 
earnest importunity, at their Indianapolis meeting in 1879, when the faRowe 
resolution was adopted : 
' Resolved, That this convention consider the introduction ot scientific temperance text-books _ 
into the regular course of study in our public schools as a most hopeful line of work. We 
therefore urge the various States here represented to take immediate action to secure this im- 
portant study taught in,the schools of their several localities.   
1It is proper to say ‘that Mrs, Hunt kindly undertook the revision of the proofs of this his- 
‘torical sketch.

        696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
-A standing committee, of which Mrs. Hunt was made chairman, was chosen 
to carry the above resolution into action. But difficulties were soon encoun- 
tered in the way of accomplishing any uniform work through a committee 
widely separated; and at the Boston meeting of the Woman’s Christian Tem- 
perance Union the ensuing year (1880) a department of scientific temperance 
instruction in schools and colleges, under a national superintendent, was created, 
to take the place of the standing committee. Mrs. Hunt, who was chiefly instru- 
mental in bringing about this change, was made superintendent of the depart- 
ment, a position she still holds. It was made her duty in that capacity “‘to 
originate, advise, and direct plans of work,” which are carried out with the 
assistance of auxiliary superintendents in all the States and Territories, be 
are under the direction of and report to the national superintendent. 
Subordinate assistants were appointed for the minor civil divisions of the State, 
so that the organization is somewhat military in character. Prompt, vigorous, 
and effective action has been thereby secured, with the ability to concentrate 
effort at any desired point. This centralization of authority has been one great 
secret of success. 
The labors of the first year, 1880, were chiefly ‘‘ confined to organizing the 
work throughout the country and to creating public interest in the proposed 
study through the press and lectures by the national superintendent before pop- 
ular audiences, educational bodies, churches, and philanthropic conferences.” 
In her Brief History of the First Decade, from which the foregoing has been 
chiefly condensed, as also much which follows, Mrs. Hunt goeson tosay: ‘‘Some 
teaching from Dr. Richardson’s Temperance ‘Lesson Book and a little work by 
Miss Coleman, entitled Alcohol and Hygiene, followed these efforts, by order of 
local school boards. The sporadic character of these results deepened the con- 
viction that the study must be mandatory or it never would be systematically 
pursued. Experience soon proved the soundness of my position from the first, 
viz., that text-books on temperance only would not fully meet the need. In 
order to understand the consequences of violating hygienic law in all respects, 
but especially in the use of alcholic drinks and other narcotics, pupils must 
-know something of relative physiology and general hygiene; therefore the study 
should be incorporated with these topics.” 
What the doctors said.—In the efforts of the leaders in the movement to make 
ogress the stock objection that met them on every side was, ‘‘‘There is noth- 
ing definite that can be taught about the effects of alcoholic drinks upon the 
human system.” ‘‘The doctors are not agreed about it.” It became evident 
that no progress could be made in getting legislation until an authoritative 
reply to this objection could be produced. 
Mrs, Hunt, therefore, went before the American Medical Association at its 
meeting at St. Paul, in June, 1882, and ‘asked them for some expression as to 
the evil nature and effects of alcoholic drinks. She presented the following 
resolutions on behalf of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union: 
Whereas alcoholic intemperance is a prolific cause of disease, and prevention, through the 
education of the people, is one of the most powerful antidotes, 
Resolved, That we approve teaching the children and youth’: in the schools and educational 
institutions in this country, as facts of pyeleney the physiological dangers and evils resulting 
from the use of alcoholic beverages; and 
Whereas it is the acknowledged duty of the State to provide for such education of the people 
as is essential to good citizenship, 
Resolved, That we recommend the State legislature to enact laws requiring the physiological 
dangers and evils resulting from the use of alcoholic beverages taught in all schools supported 
by public money or under State control. 
These resolutions were referred to the section on State medicine, which after 
some discussion adopted the following as a substitute: 
Resolved, That the association reaffirm the resolutions in regard to the abuse of alcoholie 
- liquors passed.at Buffalo in 1878, and further urge that all State legislatures introduce hygiene 
as one of the branches to be taught in the schools. 
The resolutions of 1878 so reaffirmed are as follows: ‘ 
Resolved, That in view of the alarming prevalence and ill effects of intemperance, with which 
none are so familiar as members of the medical profession, and which have called forth from 
eminent practitioners the voice of warning to the people of Great Britain concerning the use of 
alcoholic beverages, we, the undersigned, members of the medical profession of the United 
States, unite in the declaration that we believe alcohol should be classed with other powerful 
drugs, that when prescribed it should be done with conscientious caution, and a sense of great 
% responsibility. 
Resolved, That we are of the opinion that the use of alcoholic liquors asa beverage is produc- 
- tive of a large amount of physical and mental disease; that it entails diseased appetites and 
enfeebled constitutions upon offspring, and that it is the cause of a large percentage of.the 
crime and pauperism of our cities and country. 
Resolved, That we would welcome any change in public sentiment that would confine the use 
of intoxicating liquor to the uses of science, art, and medicine.  
-P-A-G-E-105
SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 697 
No one can doubt that these resolutions placed a powerful weapon in the 
hands of the promoters of the new study, or that it was most effectively used. 
“The favorite objection,” wrote Mrs. Hunt at the time, ‘‘ of opponents is silenced, 
for no one can hereafter say that the doctors of this country disprove the state- 
ment of facts against alcoholic beverages that we would teach the rising gener- 
ation.” i 
The end achieved.—A course of thorough and systematic agitation was entered 
upon to create a public sentiment in favor of compulsory temperance education 
and to influence law makers in the desired direction. As a result, the first com- 
pulsory temperance education law was enacted in Vermont, in November, 1882. 
By this law there was added to the branches to be taught in the common schools 
“elementary physiology and hygiene, which shall give special prominence to 
the effect of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics, upon the human svstem.” 
In the ensuing year laws to the same effect, more or, less stringent in their re- 
quirements, were enacted in many other States. A tabular statement’ giving 
the date of enactment of these laws and their general features will be found on 
page 713. 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
  A difficulty was experienced at first in the matter of text-books. Dr. Richard- 
son’s Temperance Lesson Book proved too technical for common school use, and 
like Miss Coleman’s book, contained only temperance matter, but no physiology 
or other hygiene which the Statelaws were demanding. Publishers and authors 
were slow to believe there would be a permanent market for this kind of litera- 
ture. 
The first physiological temperance book indorsed by the superintendent of the 
Scientific Department of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union was written 
by Dr. Steele, and published by A.S. Barnes & Co., the latter being actuated in 
their venture by philanthropic as well as business motives. 
The design of the promoters of the movement was to have ‘‘all pupils in all 
schools,” receive a temperance education, and to this end a series of at least three 
text-books would be necessary, one each for high, intermediate, and primary 
grades of schools, and four for schools closely graded. It was deemed best that 
these books should be issued by regular school-book publishing houses. 
In 1884, after a search for authors and publishers, and the disappointments of 
authors of manuscripts rejected because unsuitable, and wrath of publishers 
books who secould not be indorsed, two books.were pronounced ready for use, one 
for high schools (Steele’s Hygienic Philosophy) and one for intermediate grades 
(Hygiene for Young People). The book for primary grades was still wanting. 
Mrs. Hunt says in her report of that year: 
“Large numbers of publishers and authors have rushed into our field with 
books containing the old and disproven theories con¢éerning alcohol, badly ar- 
ranged and badly graded, and otherwise inadequate to the demands of the laws 
and the needs of the schools. These works are defective in their treatment of 
alcohol, and have not the proportion or arrangement of temperance matter that 
is intended by the spirit and letter of this legislation.” 
The ensuing year (1885) the set of three approved text-books, known as the 
Pathfinder series, was made complete by the addition of the Child’s Health 
Primer, prepared under the direction of the scientific department of the 
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. = 
As the temperance-education movement began to assume large proportions, 
‘publishers ceased to entertain doubts about a market for this kind of school 
literature. About thirty works on physiology forsschool us2 were issued by dif- 
ferent houses immediately after the passage of the New York lawin 1884. ‘‘ Most 
of these were the old-time physiologies with a little temperance matter tacked on 
the back of the book as an addenda, where pupils would rarely reach it. The 
embarrassing position of the national superintendent in not being able to indorse 
these books can hardly be appreciated.” 
The laws passed by the Legislatures of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in 
1885 excluded text-books with temperance matter in the appendix. This aroused 
the opposition of the publishers, but to no purpose ; they were obliged generally 
to remodel their books, ‘‘putting the temperance matter where it belongs, in 
each division of the subject of physiology with the other hygiene. Although 
this was the first step toward the satisfactory revision that came in later years, 
yet these books, in quality and quantity of temperance matter and adaptation to 
grade, were still so defective that they could not be indorsed,” as was the Path- 
finder series.

      EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Rigid text-book requirentents in Vermont.—The Vermont law, as amended in 1886, 
~ required that “all pupils in all public schools of.the State shall be taught thet 
nature of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics. Children too young to read shall 
receive oral instruction, and those. who can read shall use a text-book.” Text- 
books. were required to devote one-fourth theirspace to this subject, and schools 
not giving the statutory instruction forfeited their share of tho public money. 
Other States followed the example of Vermont in requiring one-fourth of the 
space of t2xt-books in physiology to be devoted to temperance instruction. 
The great petition to publiskers.—In order to bring a strong pressure to bear 
upon publishers, a syllabus was compiled in 1887 of what should be taught in the 
schools as scientific temperance, and after having been signed by over two hun- 
dred leading American citizens, ‘representative of the best. medical, physio- 
logical, chemical, educational, legal, and ethical opinion in our country,” was 
presented to publishers in form of a-petition asking for a revision of their im- 
perfect text-books upon this subject. As awhole, this petition constituted ‘‘an 
expression of the best expert sentiment of our country, in favor of teaching to 
the children of the United States the full truth of science against strong drink 
and in favor of total abstinence.” 
After this petition was sent to the publishers its syllabus of requirements was 
adopted as their standard for temperance text-books: by the National Woman’s 
Christian Temperance Union, at Nashville, November, 1887, and. became their 
ereed, or “articles of faith,” so to speak. 
The full text of the petition is as follows: 
A PETITION TO PUBLISHERS OF TEMPERANCE THEXT-BOOKS. 
1. Thirty-two States and Territories now require scientific tempérance instruction in the pub- 
» lie schools, and the question whether the children shall receive such instruction en to de- 
pend largely upon the character of the text-books employed. 2. It was the intention of those who secured these laws that the children should have tho 
latest science concerning the dangerous and hurtful qualities of alcohol used in any degree, 
and the peril of forming the habit of its use, The law requires this. Nothing less than this 
will ever satisfy its friends, i 
_. 8 Those text-books that.are largely physiology, with a minimum of temperance matter that 
only points out the evil of drunkenness and the danger df excessi e of alcoholic drinks and 
narcotics, do not meet the requirements of the law, and do not satisfy those who secured its 
enactment and who are determined to secure its enforcement, 
4, Therefore, the undersigned legislators who voted for these laws in various States and in 
the National Congress, the representatives of temperance organizations, and who are familiar 
with the sentiment and are entitled to speak for the very numerous membership of different 
churches and other. bodies, extending widely throughout the land, and citizens who-speak for 
ourselves, do make respectful and earnest appeal to all publishers of text-books on this subject 
to reyise their publications to conform to the latest results of scientific inquiry, and to meet 
the terms and spirit of these statutes in making the temperance matter the chief and not the 
subordinate topic in these books, so that public and authorized expressions of approval and 
indorsement of all such books can be issued and given wide circulation. 
5) In urging this appeal we beg leave to represent that if this new education is to give to the 
world a coming generation of intelligent total abstainers, as we expect, its manuals of instruc- 
tion must conform to the following specifications: ¥ 2 
(1) They must teach with no uncertain sound the proven findings of science, viz: ee That alcohol is a dangerous:and seductive poison. 
(6) That beer, wine, and cider contain this. same alcohol, thus making them dangerous drinks, 
» to be avoided, and that they are the product of a fermentation that changes a food to a poison. 
(c) That it is the nature of a little of any liquor containing alcohol to create an appetite for more. which is. so apt to become uncontrollable that the strongest warning should be urged 
against taking that little and thus forming the appetite. (2) They must teach also the effect of these upon “the human s; 
         
              
   
  em,” that is, upon the whole being—mental, moral, and physical. The appalling effects of drinking habits upon the citizen- 
ship of the nation, the degradation and crime resulting, demand that instruction here should 
give clear and emphatic utterance’to the solemn warnings of science on this subject. 
(83) This instruction must be as well graded to the capacities of each class of pupils as the 
modern school readers are. A book fit for high schools put into primary or intermediate 
classes will make the study afailuré there. Truth is just as true and as scientific when told in 
easy words as when put into stilted technicalties the child can. not understand. 
(4) This is not.a physiological but a temperance movement. In all grades below the high 
school this instruction should contain only physiology enough to make the hygiene of temper- 
ance and other laws of health-intelligible. Temperance should be the chief and not the subor- 
dinate topic, and should occupy at least one-fourth the space in text-pooks for these grades. 
As only a small portion of the pupils in our public schools attend high schools, and vast num- 
bers leave with the primary, this instruction should be early and ample. It is not desirable to 
have a separate book for the physiology heretofore studied in the high school or to limit the 
amount, but at least twenty pages out. of that ordinarily required should be given tothe ques: 
tion of the danger of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics, in a text-book for these classes. 
(5) This effort to disabuse the minds of the rising generation of fallacies which lead to drink 
habits should purposely ayoid- reference to the medical use of alcohol, except to state that as 
by common consent its lay prescription is condemned, the question of its use as a remedy may 
properly be relegated to medical treatises, as out of place and misleading in a school text-book. 
Lacking in any of these points,‘a text-book on scientific temperance is incomplete, and the 
use in the schools of such a book will not result in a strong temperance sentiment among the 
pupils using it. 
Because the question of total abstinence for the children of this country, and therefore of 
their well-being and that of the land soon to be governed by them, depends so largely upon the 
_ teachings in these books, we make this appeal. - E:

           SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
. t ; + 
As a result of the foregoing petition nearly all of the publishors of temperance — 
text-books expressed the desire to have their books remodeled in conformity 
therweith. This work of revision was taken up and carried on in 1888 under — 
the supervision of Mrs. M. H. Hunt, the national superintendent of the scientific — 
department of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, with the assistance 
of the following advisory board; Albert H. Plumb, D. D., president Massachu- 
setts Amendment Society; Daniel Dorchester, D. D., vice-president. Massachu- 
setts Total Abstinence Society ; William E. Sheldon, president National Teach- ~ 
‘ers’ Association of 1887; Rev. Joseph Cook, of Boston Monday Lectureship. 
Upon consultation with authors it soon became apparent that there was not so 
much difference of opinion about what was true concerning the subject as mis- 
apprehension as to what special truth should be brought forward. ‘Some writ- — 
ers were misled by supposing that exhortation or avpeal after the style of the 
temperance lecture was desired. These difficulties: vanishe@ when they found 
that we wanted no fanatical preaching, but instead a full statement as to th 
origin, evil nature, and effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcaties, all told’ 
. in language that the various grades of pupils can understand.” 7 
- “The great men among these authors who are fully abreast with the researches, 
experiments, and proven facts of modern science on this subject. were first to 
come into accord with the petition standard.” 
Now fully equipped.—Mrs.. Hunt, writing at the beginning of 1892, says: “The 
study that was thus hdmpered and halting at the first is now fully equipped. 
What it then lacked is now supplied. Everything is ready. As the teachers 
translate these methods into actual school-room work, the intent of the law 
will be accomplished in the generation of intelligent total abstainers that will 
come from our schools.” Z

. Charts.—With reference'to charts Mrs. Hunt says: ‘‘ To be worth anything to 
the cause the endorsement of this department on scientific matter must repre-: 
sent accuracy. Realizing the injury to the work sure to follow any accusation 
of inaccuracy that could be well sustained, we have hesitated about placing our 
endorsement upon physiological charts. We are yet waiting for the chart that 
_ shall be pronounced accurate, as to delineation and coloring, bythe best physio- 
logical experts, and that shall give a due representation of the evil results of 
narcotic indulgence. We would advise our friends to delay the. purchase of 
charts until some that are authorized are issued.” 
Course of study.—In order to assist in finding a place for this study, and to de- 
termine how much to teach each year and in what grades to teach it orally, ‘a 
carefully graded course of study in this branch has been prepared covering all 
these points.” ‘‘It also shows the grades or classes in both graded and ungraded 
schools to which the various books are adapted.” This course of study is as fol-

‘This plan provides for three lessons per week for fourteen weeks of each school 
_ year, after which the subject may be dropped for the remainder of the year, to 
be taken up with a more advanced treatment for the same length of time the 
following year. These courses, with well-graded text-books that contain the 
truths the law requires taught, will, if faithfully pursued, with oral or written 
reviews, cover the subject, and will not unduly crowd other studies,

    UNGRADED SCHOOLS. 
In an ungraded school, three classes should be formed, one for advanced 
pupils, one for those who rank as intermediate, and another for primary. AIL 
y pupils in the school should be divided according to their attainments among 
-.__ these three classes. 
a Is it neceSsary to have a separate book for each of the three classes referred 
to in an ungraded school? -Yes, emphatically yes. All pupils in ungraded 
schools where there are advanced pupils can not be taught as the law requires 
“with less than three grades of books. The primary or lower grade pupils need 
a book they can understand ; the next grade should have one a little more ad- 
vanced ; and pupils who correspond to the high-school grade should have a book 
adapted to their acquirements. This study has often been made a ridiculous 
, failure by the attempt in ungraded schools to make one book (and that often a 
high-school book) fit all pupils. 3

    REASONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF A COURSE OF STUDY AS OUTLINED. 
The reasons to be urged in favor of adopting a definite course of study in this 
topic, which includes text-books in the hands of all pupils above the primary, ~ 
are as follows: 
First. Such a course gives the definite time and place to the branch that the 
law demands. 
Second. It points out the grade for which oral instruction is adapted, and 
those in which instruction should be given from text-books ia the hands of. 
upils. : 
: Phird. V4 specifies the grade for which each book is adapted. The pupil just. 
learning to gain information froma text-book needs one in which the style and — 
vocabulary is very little in advance of his own. As soon as he gains ability to 
master a more advanced style and treatment he needs a more advanced book. 
To keep him longer in the book he has outgrown is to stultify his developing 
faculties. On the other hand, to give him a book too advanced is to discourage 
him and lead to a distaste for study. Either course is false economy and con- 
trary to all educational principles. = 
Fourth. The use of text-books as specified secures the teaching of truth in- - 
stead of the notions and traditions of some.teacher who has had no special edu- 
cation on this topic. ‘ 
Fijth. It will, in nearly all cases, prevent outside topics, such as the legal or 
political phases ofthe temperance question, from-being brought into the recita- 
tion under the, guise of scientific temperance instruction, which sometimes 
gives rise to trouble. 
Siath. It takes less time from the overcrowded school course than anything 
like an honest attempt above the primary class to teach the subject orally, which 
is always liable to cause waste of time through branching out into unimportant — 
collaterals. e. 
TOPICAL OUTLINE OF COURSE OF STUDY.’ 
[Prepared by Department of Scientific Temperance Instruction, W. C. T..U.] 
This age needs men and women who are wise to resolve, strong and quick to 
act. Such men and women are the result of the right development of the three- 
fold human system, mental, moral, and physical, and are the object sought by 
this study. 
?This topical outline has been furnished by Mrs. Hunt in advance of publication. =

EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Because the use of aleoholic drinks and other narcotics is a prime obstacle in 
the way of such development, a knowledge of their origin, their inherent evil 
nature, and of their destructive effects is an objective point in the study of 
scientific or physiological temperance. But itis by no means all. This study 
does not stop with teaching the consequences of evil. It atthe same time shows 
the road to the ideal. 
As demanded by law and presented in all approved manuals of instruction, it 
teaches the all-round physical education that leads to strength, health, and such 
physical development as will make the body an efficient servant of a rightly 
trained mind—a meet temple for the divine indwelling. In showing the conse- 
quences of broken natural law, it is also a powerful moral teacher. 
As some knowledge of structure is an essential basis, enough anatomy and 
physiology to make the various laws of hygiene intelligible is*a part of the 
study. The whole subject may be classified under the following divisions : 
Ten divisions. 
  (There may be differences of opinion as tothe order of presenting these divi- 
sions. It is not essential that the same order be always followed, provided 
- the division treating of the nature of alcoholic drinks.and other narcotics pre- 
cede those treating of the various organs and the effects of these narcotics upon 
them.) 
1. Food.—This division includes the uses of and kinds of food and rules for their 
selection and proper preparation, together with hygienic rules in regard to 
eating. 
(For reference and personal study the teacher should have some one of the high- 
- school books mentioned on the last page of this cireular, and for guidance in the 
selection of matter appropriate for primary grades, one or more of the primary 
books there mentioned.) 
2. Alcohohe drinks and other narcotics.—This division has for its object to show 
_ when and why healthful fruit juices and grain infusions become poisonous drinks 
that should be avoided. The instruction therefore covers the changes that take 
place in these liquids during fermentation, the causes of such changes, and the 
nature of the changed liquids, 
(For full information on these points the teacher should study this division of 
the subject in some one or more of the text-books mentioned above, and for the 
selection of matter adapted to grade, the primary text-books before mentioned.) 
3. Digestion.—Its anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, and the effects of alcoholic 
drinks and other narcotics. 
4, Circulation.—Its anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, and the effects of alco- 
holic drinks and other narcotics. In this division the controlling action of the 
vaso-motor and inhibitory nerves should be brought out as early as possible, be- 
cause many of the contradictory appearances concerning the action of alcoholic 
and other narcotics on various portions of the body are only intelligible when 
this is understood. 
5. Respiration.—Its anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, including the effects 
of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics, with special emphasis on the impor- 
tance of breathing pure air, of full and deep breathing, and of right positions for 
securing this; also of simple methods of ventilating rooms in which no provi- 
sion for ventilation has been made. Such information, put ito actual practice 
in the schoolroom, will be carried home by the children and correct many of 
the bad habits in this direction that lead to unhealthful conditions of the body 
and to drink. 
6. The nervous system.—Its anatomy, physiology, and hygienic laws that gov- 
ern the best development of nerve and brain tissue, and the consequences of 
disobeying these laws in the use of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics. The 
shock of all narcotic indulgence falls with greatest force on the nervous system. 
Instruction at this point should therefore be full and emphatic. Effects on the 
intellect, will, and moral character, as a result of its effects on brain and nerve 
tissue, should be fully brought out, as is done in all the approved text-books, 
which also indicate how much of each topic may be appropriately presented in 
each grade. 
7. The bones.—The anatomy and physiology of bone tissue and its hygiene, 
including the effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics. Special stress 
should be laid on the fact that growth lost through wrong habits during the 
_ growing time of life can never afterwards be made up, of the importance of 
right position, and the relation of proper food, and the effects of alcohol, to- 
bacco, and other narcotics in preventing healthful growth.

  SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 705 
8. The muscles.—The anatomy and physiology of muscular tissue and its hy- 
 giene, including the effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics. This divi- 
/ sion of the subject includes in its hygiene systematic exercises for the devel- 
- opment of the various tissues of the body, such as calisthenics, gymnastics, or 
what are called physical-culture exercises. 
9. The skin.—Its anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, including the relation 
of exercise, pure air, right food, bathing, and proper clothing to the hygiene 
of the skin, and the evil effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics upon the 
same. 
10. The senses.—Their anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, iicluding the effects 
of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics. 
Gradation. 
In physiological temperance, as in other branches which extend through sey- 
eral years of the school life, a few of the simple elements should be taught in 
the lowest grade, and these reviewed and more added from year to year, until ~ 
an advanced treatment of the whole topic is completed in the high school. 
In the lower primary grades a few lessons on the parts of the body should pre- 
cede the work on the other divisions, which, in the lower grades, should consist 
chiefly of hygiene with only a very littlé physiology and almost nothing of the 
anatomy of internal organs. 
Methods for primary grades. 
Simple truths should be selected for first, second, and third year pupils under 
each division of the subject, to be developed by means of simple stories, objects, 
or pictures, or questions relating to the pupil’s previous experience. The fol- 
lowing indicates what may be taught under the division of alcoholic drinks and 
other narcotics to first-year pupils, to be reviewed with added truths for second 
or third year pupils: 
First lesson: 
1. There are ferments on thedust on grapes. 
2. There is sweet juice inside the grape. 
3. When the juice is pressed out the ferments get into it. 
4, The ferments take away the sweetness of the juice and leave apoisoninit 
Second lesson : “ é 
1. Poisons can do us harm. 
2. Poisons may kill. 
3. Alcohol is a poison. 
4, We should never take any driuk that has alconol in it. 
Third lesson: 
. Cider is made from apples. 
. Ferments change the juice of the apples after it is pressed out. 
. We should not drink cider, for there is alcohol in it. 
. Wine is made from grapes. 
. We should not drink wine, for there is alcohol in it. . 
. There is no alcohol in grapes or apples. OouR 
oboe 
Methods for lower intermediate grades. 
The law, in saying that this study should be introduced and taught asa regular 
branch, virtually says that the established methods of teaching other branches 
with text-books when pupils are able to read, and orally before,is to be the 
method here. But the books used should be adapted to grade. Where such 
books are in the hands of the pupils three lessons per week for fourteen weeks 
of the school year will allow time for covering as much of each division of the 
subject as the pupils are capable of understanding, without repetition or crowd- 
ing other branches. When pupils have mastered so much of a topic as is adapted ~ 
to their grades, they should not go over and over the same with needless repeti- 
tion. The subject, after suitable reviewing, should be dropped for the remainder 
of the year and something else take its place, 
Fourth-year pupils.—Pupils in the fourth year of school are ready to begin to 
learn to use text-books, and should at this point begin to pursue this branch as 
aregular text-book study. The matter contained in the indorsed primary text- 
ED 90. 45 ‘   
   
-P-A-G-E-114
  2006) = : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
~ hook has been carefully culled with special reference to what is adapted to this 
grade of pupils. Z 
Fifth and six year pupils.—Pupils in these grades are prepared fora larger dis- 
cussion of the subject, which should here, as in all grades above the primary, be 
a text-book study. More time would therefore be required to cover the subject, _ 
which may here be distributed over a period of two years. Fifth-year pupils 
- may take a part of the ten divisions, as food, alcoholic drinks, and other narcot- 
ics, digestion, circulation, respiration. [The hygiene of the last three will in- 
clude the effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics.] 
Sixth-year pupils, after reviewing the work of the fifth year, may take the 
remaining divisions, as bones, muscles, skin, the nervous system, the senses’ 
{each including in its hygiene the effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics]. 
For the use of pupils in these grades a large variety of books that contain the 
matter that should be taught at this stage, expressed in language adapted to the 
comprehension of the pupils, without the use of technical terms, are ready and ~ 
indorsed by the friends of the movement. 
Advanced grammar grades. 
For seventh and eighth year pupils the topics may be apportioned as in the fifth 
and six year grades; but the pupils will require text-books containing a more 
advanced treatment of the subject. Nothing is more detrimental to the object 
sought by this study than attempting to make one grade of books on temperance 
_ physiology fit all grades of pupils. 
High-school grades. 
The spirit and letter of the law requires this to be a text-book study in this 
grade., High-school pupils are See of comprehending the partially techni- 
cal treatment found in the indorsed high-school physiologies mentioned on p. 
699. This can be easily mastered the first year of the high-schoolcourse. Where 
examinations show that it has been so mastered the study is completed and should 
be dropped and not repeated through the other years. Pupils in thé second 
and third years of the high school who have not had this study should take it 
up in those grades. 
Ungraded schools. 4 
The divisions are the same here as in the graded schools. The pupils should 
be arranged in classes according to their attainments, ordinarily three—a pri- 
mary, an intermediate, and amore advanced. Each class of pupils able to read 
should have books corresponding to their various grades. Atleastthree grades 
of books on this subject are generally needed for ungraded schools. 
THE SPECIAL WORK OF 1890. 
“The special work of 1890 has been careful planning for thorough enforcement 
of legislation that has made scientific temperance a mandatory study. Two 
States, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, began this year what may be termed 
campaigns for this enforcement. The State organizations, after voting to make 
this a leading line of work, provided fuuds for paying the expenses of county 
superintendents or other organizers to go through the counties securing local 
workers; also for the necessary literature and postage. Literature, showing 
the local superintendents, as fast as they were appointed, exactly what to do in 
every detail of the work, was then sent out from State and national headquar- 
ters.’ 
“As soon as active work for enforcement was begun it became apparent that 
an accepted standard as to what coustitutes an honest enforcement of a temper- 
ance education law is as necessary as the standard for temperance text-books 
proved. Time and experience have established something like school-room 
standards for the pursuit of other branches; but the conceptions as to how this 
new subject should be studied and taught were vague, various, and indefinite. 
From consultation with eminent educators and comparison of the fruits of varied 
experience the following standard was wrought out. This is being sent to~ 
superintendents of public instruction intrusted with the enforcement of temper- 
ance education laws in various States. Its specifications as to minimum of time, 
necessary means, and method for the pursuit of the study is receiving their 
cordial indorsement :” -

     A STANDARD FOR THE-ENFORCEMENT OF A TEMPERANCE EDUCATION LAW 
1, Minimum of time.\—The pursuit of the study of physiological temperance by “all pupils in ~~ 
all schools,” as the law demands, requires at least three lessons per week for fourteen weeks of 
each school year below the second year of the high school. After an adequate and well-graded 
ao POR ON: of the topic assigned for this time is thoroughly learned, the subject may then be 
iropped for the remainder of that year. The following year a little more advanced treatment 
of the subject should be pursued for the same length of time. Allowing twenty minutes toa 
lesson for all grades or classes above the primary, this requirement would amount to only ~ 
fourteen hours per year; butif carried through the several years between the primary and the 
second year of the high school or corresponding class of ungraded schools, would give suffi- 
olen. time for a thorough comprehension of the subject without encroaching upon other S 
studies. 2 2. Necessary means for the fulfillment of the law.—Well-graded text-books on physiology and 
hygiene that contain also the ‘‘spécial” facts concerning the nature and effects of alcoholic 
drinks, tobacco, and other narcotics, that the law requires taught. These facts can not be 
treated in less than one-quarter of the space given to. the physiology and hygiene appropriate 
tor primary and intermediate grades, or in less than twenty pages of the ordinary high-school . 
ee These books should be as well graded to the capacities of pupils as modern’ school Z 
readers ar } 3. Necessary method.2—Text-hooks in the hands of pupils who use text-books in studying such 
other branches as arithmetic or geography, and oral instruction, not less than three times per 
week, for those not sufficiently advanced to use text-books. 
4. Buaminations or tests.3—As thorough examinations or tests should be required in this study 
as in other branches, the same marking system should be used, and such marks should enter 
into the general average which decides the rank of the pupil. Ss 
The above standard of requirement for the enforcement of a temperance educationlawis .— 
both fair and just. Anything less would not represent the spirit and letter of this legislation, 
and would not be a pursuit of the subject ‘‘as a regular branch” by ‘“‘all pupils in all schools,” “s 
as the laws of many States demand. a

1Three lessons per week for fourteen weeks is specified, instead of one lesson per week for 
forty weeks, or two lessons per week for twenty-one weeks, because when the lessons come 
farther apart the pupils forget the last before they reach the next; the subject as a whole does 
not become so readily a part of the intelligence; more time has to be taken in reviewing the 
last lesson before taking up the new; the pupil’s interest is not so well sustained, nor profi- 
ciency so easily acquired, as when the lessons are given in closer succession. 
2 Without well-authenticated text-books in the hands of pupils, error is as Mable to be taught 
as truth, for teachers have rarely received even a brief course of instruction in the subject, and 
their knowleege of the same is therefore made up of as much folklore asfact. Much time is 
also liable tc be wasted over matters that are entirely irrelevant, such as the legal or political 
phases of the temperance question, whenever the text-book is not followed. < 
8 Teachers will be more thorough in Ee subject in which the pupils, and hence their. 
faithfulness in teaching it, are put toa test. The. pupils will also study a subject more faith- 
fully when they know that their standing or promotion depends upon their ability to pass an 
examination in it.

708 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The following, relating to the requirements of institute instructors and the 
oa duties of school boards, is taken from Mrs. Hunt’s work, ‘‘A Brief History of the 
First Decade,” before referred to: 
t INSTITUTE INSTRUCTORS. 
There is now great need of trained institute instructors on this topic. Great 
he harm has been done this cause, and the study has been brought into disrepute, 
by persons going before institutes and attempting to give instruction when they 
were not qualified to do so, and were not prepared to answer the questions pro- 
pounded by critics, friendly or otherwise. 
An institute instructor on this topic should have the following qualifications: 
1. He, or she, should be a good physiologist. 
2. Should be thoroughly familiar with the biological side of the question as 
revealed by the researches of the last few years. Should be well read in the 
works of Pasteur, De Barry, Troussart, Shurtzenberger and others on fermenta- 
tion. 
: 3. Should know enough of modern investigation to be able to refute, on the 
ch testimony of scientific experts, the popular fallacies concerning the nature of 
alcohol, especially as found in the most common drinks, beer, wine, cider, ete. 
4. Should be familiar with the great physiological authorities on the subject 
or the erect of these narcotics upon the human system, mental, moral, and 
physical, 
‘>. Should be familiar with all the school literature on this subject and be able 
to Pome out quickly where one book is defective and where and why another is 
sound. e 
6. Should understand thoroughly the matter of grading the topic, i. e., what 
should be taught the first year and what enlargement of the subject should be 
added each succeeding year, through all the grades, in order that ‘‘all the 
pupils in all schools” may be taught the subject as the law demands without 
- unnecessary repetition. 
7. Should be familiar with modern methods of teaching as based upon psycho- 
logical principles, so as to be able to present this subject in harmony with the 
ame. 
3 8. Should have also what is called ‘‘ platform powers,” i. ¢., ability to present 
By this subject with clearness, enthusiasm,and the magnetism which holds an 
: audience. 
The subject of physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the nature 
and effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics, is a large one requiring 
Se exact knowledge on the part of anyone who would attempt to instruct teachers. 
a For those who can fully meet these requirements there is a wide opening, and 
: correspondence with such is invited by the national superintendent of this de- 
partment, Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, Hyde Park, Mass. 
A bureau for the training of such instructors on this topic for teachers’ insti- 
tutes is already under way. Applicants for the course of training will be 
required to present testimonials as to previous education, capacity for study, 
aptness to teach, and power to interest an audience. _The instructors now pre- 
paring for this work have had experience as institute instructors on other 
topics, and have established a reputation in that direction. 
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 
  = The parties who ought to take the first official steps in the enforcement of a 
temperance education law are ordinarily the local school boards. These steps, 
if rightly taken, are: 
(1) The adoption of a definite course of study, with time and place given to it 
as to other branches, and for each grade of pup’ 
é (2) The recommendation of text-books containing the facts the law requires 
a taught, graded to the capacities of the several classes of scholars. 
Bs, In the discharge of these duties on the part of the schcol boards, there is 
A wide room for improvement. They have too often recommended books notably 
- lacking in temperance matter, and so absolutely out of grade as to be practically 
* useless. Conscientious teachers in such cases have tried to give oral instruc- 
tion, but they have not had the previous drill in this branch that they have 
had in others. When neither the teacher nor the books are in possession of 
_the facts to be taught, it is not strange that the teacher soonruns out of matter 
for the so-called oral instruction, 
           
-P-A-G-E-117
  SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 709 
Oralinstruction on this topic, in all grades above primary, has been, and still 
is, a signal failure. We must insist upon text-book study in all grades using 
text-books for other like branches, if we would not be mocked with disappoint- 
ment in results, 
A master in a city school, under temperance education law, recently said: 
“‘T can and will teach this branch when it is put into my course of study and 
books containing the subject are put into my hands and those of my pupils, but 
the school board must do that first. If they fill my course of study absolutely 
full with other branches, leaving no time for this, and in addition, neglect to 
give me or my pupils any adequate text-books, I can not do much.” 
This statement represents the relation of school boards to the enforcement of 
these laws, and reveals the greatest hindrance to be overcome. The neglect 
with these officials is often due to misapprehension or indifference, and some- 
times to positive opposition. The appeal in the latter case is to the people for 
the election of persons who will execute the law. The man who would with-. 
hold this instruction from the children of a city or modify its full truth for fear 
of injuring the bréwing or other liquor interests is most unfit to be intrusted 
with any care of the education of the children in this age. Misapprehension on 
the part of school boards can be enlightened; that should be the work of the 
local superintendent. The indifferent can ordinarily be aroused; if not, they 
should be retired. 
Hard indeed must be the heart of the man or woman who could deliberately 
withhold the utmost warning science has against strong drink and other nar- 
cotics from the children under his or her care. If we deliberately or otherwise 
withhold a given information from a child are we not responsible for what may. 
follow to that child’s future and to others through him because of such withhold- 
ing? Is it too much to say that the officials who carelessly, negligently, or pur- 
osely fail to provide for the full enforcement of the temperance education laws 
in the schools under their control, are incurring a fearful and personal responsi- 
bility for the drunkenness of the future? The time has come for calling atten- 
tion to this from pulpit, platform, and press. . 
Il—THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM AND 
THE METHOD OF TEACHING THEM. 
By Pror. A. C. BOYDEN, OF BRIDGEWATER, MAss. 
[From proceedings National Educational Association, 1886.] 
* * * Two very practical questions remain for us as teachers. The two are 
these: What shall we teach ? and How shall we teach it? That is, what shall 
we select from all the mass of material that has been prepared upon this subject 
for the young pupil? Much is especially adapted to them. Much we can give 
them with assurance. Many of the facts can be presented correctly, simply, and 
effectively to the children. And when we have made our selection, the impor- 
tant question comes, how shall we present the subject according to the best 
methods of teaching and in such a way as to lead to conviction on the part of 
the young. Let me say, what I am going to repeat a great many times through- 
out this discourse, that it is not mere knowledge that we are to teach—it is con- 
viction that we are to bring to the minds and the wills of these pupils. Stop- 
ping with mere knowledge will notaccomplish the work. -Whatshall we teach? 
First. A knowledge of the human body: Its external parts; the relations of 
those parts to each other: the uses of these parts, and especially the proper 
care of them; a knowledge of these delicate organs, the senses that we have 
and the work which they do for us, and the care which we should take of them; 
. the work done by the important systems within our bodies, the way in which 
they do that work, and the care which they should receive from us—not merely 
a knowledge that we have certain parts, that we use them in certain ways, and 
that they can be taken care of in certain ways, but we should lead the mind to — 
a profound conviction of the marvelous construction of our body, the delicate 
arrangement of its parts and the duty of each one of us to take the very best care 
of these houses of our souls. Not the mere knowledge, we repeat, but the con- 
viction of the duty to care for these. This work is the preparation for the later 
work. 
Second. A knowledge of the origin, properties, and uses of the various stimu- 
lants and narcotics; that the children may recognize them when they see them ;      
     
-P-A-G-E-118
710. EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
that they may know the properties, and the effects upon the human body, and 
that they may know why alcohol has this certain influence upon the human body. 
Third, and most important: That these narcotics, especially alcohol, tobacco, 
and opium, upon the human body; what they do and why they doit. Now, with 
your indulgence, I shall hope to offer afew suggestions in answer to these two 
questions, what shall we teach and how shall we teach it, with some very simple 
experiments. TI have gone to the extreme of simplicity in order to avoid the ob- 
jections which come from so many teachers who say: ‘‘I have had no practice 
in any laboratory. Iam situated in a school where very few, if any, appliances 
are given tome.” I wish to present that which can be used by every man and 
woman in every schoolhouse in this land ; requiring no previous laboratory work, 
requiring no great outlay or expense. Of course in those schools which are 
more favorably situated, more advanced experiments may be conducted ; but I 
- intend to present those experiments which will give asufficient knowledge of the 
effects on the human body, so that if it is taught rightly the children will be 
saved. Now, in this work, so far as I can show it before such a large audience, 
-_ L will leave the subject of general physiology, and come directly to the subject 
of narcotics, their origin, their properties, and uses, and what they do to the hu- 
- man bddy; and I have selected for their principal work, 
ALCOHOL, 
I.—ORIGIN OF ALCOHOL. 
1.—In fermented liquors. 
Experiment 1. Add molasses to water in a bottle till itis of adeep brown color, 
‘then add a teaspoonful of yeast; allow it to stamd in a warm place for a day or 
two. Observation: The mixture has the odor of alcohol, later a sour, acid 
odor; the mixture ‘has a sharp taste. Inference: The Tittle yeast has changed 
the sugar of the molasses to alcohol; this will change to acid if left alone. Call 
the yeast plant a ‘‘ ferment,” and the process of changing ‘‘fermentation.” 
Experiment 2. Allow apple juice to stand exposed to the air for a few days. 
Observation: The liquid has the odor of alcohol, also the biting taste. Later 
-ithas a sour, acid taste like vinegar. Inference: Very small ferments from 
. the air have changed the sugar of the apple juice to alcohol. Call the liquid 
“cider.” The alcohol will change to vinegar if left exposed to the air. © ~ 
Cider is formed by the fermentation of apple juice in the air, S 
Wines are formed by the fermentation of grape juice, etc., in the air. 
Ales ae beers are formed by the fermentation of the sugar of grains. (Malt 
liquors. 
Bulasbol is an essential constituent of all these fermented liquors; nature will 
change it to an acid ifleft to itself. 
  2.—In distilled liquors. 
aes Experiment 3. Heat. cider or wine in a test tube over an alcohol lamp; pass 
the steam through a glass tube into a bottle which is wrapped in a wet cloth to 
condense this steam. Observation: The odor and taste are more marked than 
~ in the fermented liquors; often there isa bitter taste. Inference: The con- 
densed liquor isstronger than the fermented liquor and is changed: into new sub- 
stances oftentimes. Call this process of evaporating and condensing “ distilla- 
tion,” and the resulting liquid a ‘‘ distilled liquor.” 
Brandy is distilled from wines. 
Gin is distilled from beer and flavored with juniper berries. 
Whisky is distilled from the wort of fermented grain. 
Rum is distilled from fermented molasses. 
II.—PROPERTIES AND USES OF ALCOHOL. 
Experiment 4. Examine alcohol for its color, odor, and taste. Place alittle 
or the hand. Observation: Alcohol is a transparent liquid, has a strong odor, 
and a biting taste. Inference: The rapid evaporation of the alcohol makes the 
hand feel cool—it is a volatile liquid. 
; Experiment 5. Place a little inaspoon; apply a lighted match. Observation: 
. Itburnsina blue; hot flame. Inference: Alcohol is inflammable because it unites 
easily with the oxygen of the air. . ‘

Call this ‘‘ coagulation.” Inference: Alcohol coagulates albuminous substances 
by extracting the water from them. 
Properties.—Alcohol is a transparent liquid, odorous, has biting taste, is vola- 
tile. It dissolves many resinous substances, and mixes with most oils. It is 
inflammable, has great affinity for oxygen. It coagulates albumen, has attrac- 
tion for water. Uses (resulting from these properties), external application to 
allay inflammation. Alcoholic lamps for heating purposes. A solvent for gums 
in preparing varnishes. In preparation of perfumery, medicines, etc. Preser- — 
vation of museum specimens. 
Ill.—EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN BODY. 
1.—Alcohol impairs digestion. 
Experiment 9. Place with the finger a little alcohol on the inside membrane 
of the mouth (a mucous membrane);* repeat this several times. Observation: 
The membrane stings, the saliva flows freely, finally there is a dry, puckery 
feeling. Inference: Alcohol inflames the membrane, excites the flow of the 
liquid which it secretes, and absorbs the moisture in it. 
Application.—The lining membrane of the mouth also lines the stomach and 
the other organs of the digestive system. A small amount of alcohol will cause 
aprofuse flow of the gastric juice and pass very rapidly into the blood. A larger 
amount inflames and irritates the lining membrane of the stomach. A continued 
usé weakens the quality of the gastric juice by the unusual and irregular fiow, 
also impoverishes the blood from which it comes. It irritates the constantly in- _ 
flamed membrane of the stomach, leading to an ulcerous condition and chronic 
inflammation. 
Experiment 10. Add alcohol to raw meat, also rub some meat in water till it 
is well colored with blood, add alcohol to this blood. Observation: The liquid 
is full of white particles and the meat seems hard. Inference: The alcohol has 
coagulated the albumen of the meat and blood. 
Experiment 11. Add alcohol to some of the pepsin of the gastric juice. Ob- 
servation: The pepsin contains white, stringy particles. Inference: Alcohol — 
coagulates pepsin. : 
Novrs.—To prepare the pepsin get from the butcher the inside membrane of 
a pig’s stomach, cut into fine pieces and soak it in glycerine for afew hours, 
The glycerine dissolves the pepsin; strain through a fine cloth. Prepared pep- 
sin can be bought of the druggist. ‘ 
Application.—Pepsin is the active solvent of the gastric juice. Alcohol tends | 
to harden the food and coagulate the pepsin, thus retarding digestion.. Contin- 
ued use tends to chronic indigestion and to the intensifying of any disease of 
the digestive system.   
2.—Alcohol absorbs the water of the body. 
Refer to experiments 8 and 9. Alcohol not only absorbs water from the albu- 
. men which it coagulates, but the whole system floods it with water to dilute it 
and render it less harmful. Hence alcohol absorbs the water of the saliva, of 
the gastric juice, of the blood, of the tissues, and of all thesecretions. This soon ~ 
results in a craving for fluid to suppiy the body, really a ‘‘thirst” for water, 
requiring time for its absorption throughout the system, but temporarily satis- 
fied by more exciting drink. 
3.—Alcohol destroys the blood corpuscles. 
Experiment 12. Prick with a pin under the finger nail and draw a drop of 
blood; place this on a bit of glass and examine with a magnifying glass. Ob- 
serve the way in which the little blood corpuscles are arranged. Touch them 
with the smallest amount of alcohol. Observation: The corpuscles are gf an 
ver do that or teach others “H, Hunt.

    T12 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
irregular shape and have lostpartof their color. Add more alcohol. Observa- 
tion: The corpuscles are an irregular mass of a whitish color. Inference: Al- 
cohol coagulates the albumen of the corpuscles and dissolves the.coloring mat- 
ter. Refer also to experiment 5. 
Application.—Alcohol at once enters the blood, seizes the oxygen that the 
red corpuscles are carrying to the various parts of the bod’y, dissolves the color- 
ing matter, and coagulates the albumen of these corpuscles; hence the blood 
partially fails in its work of carrying new matter to the tissues and in eliminat- 
ing the waste matter. The result isa clogging of thesystem with effete matter, 
poisoning of the blood, diseases of the skin, liver, and kidneys. . The retarding 
of the combustion within the body lowers its temperature in direct proportion 
to the amount of alcohol taken. 3 
4.— Alcohol ruins the blood vessels. 
Observe the crust of earthy matter on the inside of bottles of grape wine. 
Inference: The earth matter which was soluble in the grape juice is thrown 
down by the alcohol in the wine. 
Application.—The mineral matter is being carried by the blood to the bones, 
is precipitated by the alcohol, and forms a crust in the blood vessels and in all 
the tissues, making them weak and brittle. As a result blood vessels burst 
. Mnder any unusual strain, and apoplexy results. 
5.—Alecohol paralyzes nerve matter. (A narcotic.) 
Experiment 18. Etherize or chloroform a frog by soaking a wad of cotton and 
putting it in his mouth, or place a spoonful of ether in a jar of water and immerse 
_ the frog. When insensible carefully cut upon the skin and flesh of the leg till 
the nerve is exposed. Touch a drop of alcohol to the exposed nerve. Observa- 
tion: The nerve becomes stiff and white, the trembling of the limb ceases. In- 
ference: Alcohol has paralyzed the live nerve matter. 
Application.—A small dose of alcohol causes incipient paralysis of the nerves 
of the tissues and brain; this causes an extra activity for the purpose of diluting 
and expelling the poison from the system, manifested by the ‘‘ animated ap- 
pearance, the throbbing of the arteries, the flush of the face, and the sparkle of 
the eye.” This paralysis also numbs any feelings of pain, apparent benefits 
arising from previous paralysis. The paralysis of the nerves controlling the 
muscular walls of the capillaries weakens their elasticity, at the same time the 
heart increases its action, hence the blood tends to remain near the surface, and 
an extra radiation of heat takes place, a second reason for the lower tempera- 
ture of the body. 
Increase the dose and the paralysis of the brain increases in this order: First, 
of the delicate nerve matter of the superior brain (cerebellum), blunting the 
highest functions, reverence, modesty, love, etc., its reflex action is the loss of 
control of the connecting nerves, thus moral power fails and the lower nature 
is supreme ; ‘second, the part of the brain controlling voluntary motion is par- 
alyzed, and also that part which is said to preside over the thoughts (cerebrum), 
_ at the same time the nerves are paralyzed, resulting in an insensibility to pain 
and injury—this goes on till a person is “dead drunk ;” third,—the last part 
of the nervous system affected is that which controls the involuntary actions, 
breathing, etc.—this paralysis causes death. 
. Continued use leads to a degeneracy of nerve matter and tissue by the con- 
stant paralysis and repair, because the structure of the nerve matter is changed, 
hence ‘‘disorders occasioned by the strain imposed on the system, diseases 
traceable to the general degeneration of the system, and diseases which might 
otherwise be averted or resisted ;” finally the insatiable demand for alcohol: 
diseases of the nerve, delirium, and death. 
This extra exertion of the organs tends to weaken them, which accounts for 
the fact you are all familiar with, namely, that when a person is taken with a 
“serious disease and is brought to the hospital the first thing the physician or 
surgeon who comes to him says is: Has this person been using alcohol? Yes; 
and he shakes his head. There isa question about that. That extra exertion 
of those organs which has been going on eliminating poison from that man _ 
makes it impossible for those organs to resist the terrible strain of a new dis- 
‘ease. The physician says to another: Has this person used alcoholic liquors? 
No., Then we will try to pull him through. Those organs have not been ex- 
erted under that terrible strain. Now the effect on this nerye matter of pulling

it down, paralyzing it to-day, then mending it, pulling it down, and to-morrow 
mending it, paralyzing it a little more the next day, and mending it again, 
changes the constitution of that nerve matter so that it gets into what we call a 
diseased condition. And there isasecond reason for this terrible thirst that 
comes over a man. Such thirst that nothing, as he says, in heaven or earth 
will stop him in getting that liquor; and why? Because of the changed con- 
dition of that nerve matter, and it looks as if there was no remedy for him. 
Surely itis a terrible condition for a man to reach. 
Now, without going further, I think I have made the points that I desire: 
That in teaching these points we should lay the foundation on simple experi- 
ments (with substances which are the same or similar to those of the human 
body), performed by the pupils themselves. That, I say, should be the founda- 
tion. ‘Then we should apply these facts and explain the action on the human 
body. This may be supplemented by reading, not from one book, but from many 
books, of the effects, which can not be shown by simple experiments, but which 
are the result of difficult scientific experiments and of medical experience. 
Now let me leave these thoughts with you: Teach very carefully out of a full 
knowledge of the subject; discriminatingly, not with exaggeration, but for the 
purpose of finding the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Teach 
scientifically, according to the principles of the very best science, basing the - 
work upon experiments in the hands of the pupils. Teach impressively. AsI 
said at first a person may know all about these facts that Ihave presented and 
yet go right on doing just the same thing as before. ‘The lessons should be taught 
in such a way by the teacher as to bring conviction and decision to the minds of 
each one of the children. Any teacher that fails to reach that point has failed 
in moying the wills of the children. Teach for the sake of developing right 
habits aad good character.

effécts of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system.”

~ SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 15 
Up to the present time the teaching has been desultory and the results inap- preciable. Some teachers are earnest and enthusiastic on the subject, many 
take hold of it in a cold, perfunctory way, and many, I fear, neglect-it alto- 
gether. Some teachers, when the law was passed, found themselves unprepared. 
to do anything in that line, and, not having the fear of an examination before 
them, failed to make any adequate preparation. Some of the county boards — 
very properly required an examination of their teachers in this subject and en- 
tomology before issuing renewals of certificates. The course of study suggested. 
by the State board of education supplies the data for some years only. 5 
I would suggest that county superintendents give this subject a more promi- 
nent place at their institutes and in their teachers’ examinations and that 
pupils be examined thoroughly in the work prescribed for each grade; also, that 
by legislative enactment scientific temperance be added to the branches in 
which applicants for teachers’ certificates must be examined, and that the 
words ‘intemperate habits” be added to the clause bearing upon the revoca- 
tion or suspension of certificates. 
If this were done the almost universal desire which I have observed among 
our superintendents and teachers to uphold the law would produce beneficial 
results in this direction.

  Methods of instruction. —Eugene De Bum, superintendent of San Diego schools: 
In connection with the work in physiology, alcoholic drinks and narcotics are 
treated of as fully ineach grade as the comprehension of the pupils will permit. 
The teacher talks with the class of the manufacture of alcohol, its uses in the 
arts, and the beverages in which it isfound. A brief history of tobacco is given- 
with the process of manufacture and the ways in which it is used. Thedeserip, 
tion, uses, and hygiene of each part of the body; the skin, the muscles, the 
bones, the stomach, the lungs, etc., are taught; the effects of aleohol and to- 
bacco are given with the hygiene. Caution as to using other narcotics, as opium 
and morphine, is given the pupils. This work is not only laid out in thecourse ~ 
of study, but it is done in the school room. : 1 
COLORADO. : 
Generally observed.—State Superintendent L. S. Cornell reports (1888): The 
temperance law passed by the last legislature has been generally observed 
throughout the State. In all of our schools instruction as to the effect of alcohol 
and narcotics on the human system has been given. The law, as passed, is 
somewhat vague and indefinite, yet.it has been obeyed as the school boards un- 
derstood it. 
Douglas County reports (1890) the law as ‘‘ generally enforced.” 
CONNECTICUT. 
- REPORTS OF SCHOOL VISITORS. 
Lack of text-books and of interest.—The evident intention of our legislators in 
the law requiring the study in our schools of physiology as connected with alco- - 
holism is not being realized as it should be, owing to a lack of appropriate text- 
books, as well as a lack of interest in all concerned. The devastation, moral, 
physical, and financial, resulting from the drink traffic, calls for a more full and 
clear understanding of the direful effects of indulging in alcoholic drinks, and 
also tobacco in its various forms, that those who persist in going the downward 
road may not present the plea of ignorance as an excuse. Statistics of classes - 
pursuing a college course show conclusively that those who indulge in the use 
of the weed rarely attain to the highest position meytally or physically. _Fash- 
ion and habit hold a tyrant’s sway over the boys who think they have attained 
to manliness when they can sport a cigar, or flood the spittoon, the fleor, or the 
walk with foul tobacco juice; and we know the natural tendency of this habit 
is to lead on to the saloon. The moral obtuseness of those addicted to the use 
of strong drink is something startling to every thoughtful mind. The great 
majority of the accidents and crimes which are so appalling are directly tracea- 
ble to aleohol, which is the provocative of nearly every sin in the calerdar. I 
shall probably be accus2d of want of jiberality in this matter, but when our law-

makers in their wisdom have seen fit to place such a law-on the statute book, it 
is well for us to heed it, especially when we are charged with the moral and 
physical, as well as mental, wellbeing of the young in our communities.—Plym- 
outh, L. D. Baldwin, acting visitor. 
_ Regularly and faithfully taught.—The subject of physiology and hygiene has 
been regularly and faithfully taught. A conscientious effort has been.made to 
select and teach the facts best adapted to the mental status of the pupil, and to 
impress him with the importance of obeying the laws of health which a consid- 
eration of the body and its complicated machinery suggests. So far as practica- 
ble scientific terms are avoided, and the matter is presented in language within 
the comprehension of the pupil. 
The composition and nature of alcohol and tobacco are studied, and the effects 
which they produce when taken into the system. The evils which flow from 
their long-continued use are pointed out, and the effort made to create an im- 
pression which will result in total abstinence.—Norwich Central District, N. L. 
Bishop, superintendent. 
x DELAWARE, ~ 
— _ Growing more and more popular.—Superintendent James H. Ward, of Sussex 
- County, reports: The study of physiology and hygiene is growing more and 
more popular every year. Three years ago these two branches were introduced 
into our schools. During the first year comparatively few schools used the book, 
but now nearly all the schools in the county are making use of it; and very soon 
none, we think, will be without it. The teachers prove themselves in the ex- 
aminations to be much more conversant with these subjects now than they were 
three years ago, and their interest will, of course, to a great extent assure us of 
the interest and advancement of the pupils in this part of a popular education. 
We feel gratified that the people begin to show themselves interested in this 
work, and begin to feel that the laws of health should be taught in our schools, 
and that the principles of temperance instilled into the children’s minds should 
be considered a part of a good, substantial education,

health and in regard to the effect on the human system of narcotics and alcohol. 
Whatever opinions may be held concerning the liquor traffic, every intelligent 
man will welcome all honest efforts to enlighten the people in regard to the 
physical effects of narcotics and intoxicants. 
IOWA. 
, 
[From Report of State Superintendent Henry Sabin, 1888-89.] 
Scientific temperance instruction.—The law requiring that regular instruction 
shall be given in all the public schools of the State having special reference to the 
effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system 
has been the subject of much thought and attention. I believe the law has been 
steadily growing in favor, and that its provisions are generally complied with 
by our teachers. Not only has the attention of teachers been called to the abso- 
lute necessity of obeying the letter of the law, but in most of our county insti- 
tutes valuable instruction has been given in methods of teaching this branch 
and in. the arrangement of the subject-matter, so as to make the teaching most 
effective. i 
In response to many inquiries, in May, 1888, the following circular was dis- 
tributed among the teachers for their guidance and direction: 
To county superintendents and teachers of Towa: 
We are often asked as to the limit of instruction in the branch of scientific temperance in- 
struction. 
The evident intent of the law is to place the teaching of the nature and effects of stimulants 
and narcotics upon the same basis as other branches taught in our public schools. The pupil 
gains his knowledge of arithmetic by successive steps; he must pass an examination in one 
part of the subject, and show his familiarity with it before he is advanced to the next division. 
Scientific temperance instruction should be treated in the same manner. One portion should 
be thoroughly mastered before the next is entered upon. If this is well done,the teacher will 
often find work enough in one part of the subject io employ and interest the pupils during a 
whole term. Careful consideration will convince us that the work in this branch of study is 
too superficial in many of our schools, because we are attempting more ina given time than can 
be done well. Temperance instruction needs to be reduced to a system.  
-P-A-G-E-125
SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
We suggest the following plan: ‘ 
In the first division, intended for little children, let the work be entirely oral, and confine the 
subject-matter largely to the simple rules of health, as cleanliness, exercise, and habits of eat- 
ing and drinking, with but little of physiology or anatomy. 
In the second division, instruction should still be given orally, but an advance may be made, 
in-that the pupil should be required to carefully reproduce what has been given him, and to 
commit to memory facts and principles, soas to make them his own. The department of hy- 
giene may be enlarged, and something of the mechanism of the body may be added. It is to be 
noticed, however, that this oral work should be very carefully prepared, with method and 
thought, in order to adapt it to the capacity of the papas. It is of especial importance in these 
two divisions that you give, if possible, a strong bent to the child’s mind against the use of 
liquor and tobacco. 
In the third division the use of the text-book should begin. Here more individual study and 
work on the part of the pupil isnecessary. It would not be well to endeavor to cover the whole 
ground of physiology and hygiene. The functions of the more important organs HY, should 
be thoroughly studied and explained. The action of stimulants and narcotics upon these or- 
gans should be faithfully impressed upon the child’s mind. 
Tn advanced divisions the whole subject of the human body, its mechanism, its needs and pro- 
tection, may be carefully studied. At this stage afew of the more important technical names 
may be learned, and the functions of the various organs more minutely described. 
In all your work care should be taken to give instruction in accordance with the spirit of the 
law. Total abstinence should be taught as the only sure way to escape the evils arising from 
the use of alcoholic drinks and tobacco. This systematic plan, if carefully followed, will insure 
a more thorough understanding of the subject, and teachers will not complain that they have 
used up all their material. 
Allow me to suggest to county superintendents that you give this study, especially as it has 
reference to the effects of stimulants and narcotics upon the human system, the attention which 
it deserves at your coming institute; and that at examinations you submit to your teacher 
anor Luy COntEronens te questions to test their knowledge, as required by section 3 of the 
aw. Reports from every county in the State indicate that there is a very general desire to admin- 
ister the law faithfully. Considering the difficulties naturally arising when a new branch is 
introduced into the course of study, the progress made is very encouraging. The attention the 
subject received last year in institutes greatly assisted teachers in their work. Our confidence. 
in the fidelity of the school officers and instructors of Iowa to any trust imposed upon them 
makes us certain that much more will be accomplished during the coming year. To assist in 
this important work the hearty codperation of all is invited. 
HENRY SABIN, - 
Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
Des MOINES, May 20, 1888. 
The code should be amended so as to require the teacher to include in his 
register, which he files with the secretary at the close of his school, a certificate 
that he has fully compiied with the provisions of the law. Section 1745 should 
also be amended, so that the secretary should be required to furnish the county 
superintendent with a transcript of the action of the board, as required by laws 
of 1886, and also with the names of those"teachers who have and those who have 
not filed the required certificate. 
The attempt to teach the children and youth the injurious effects of stimu- 
lants and narcotics promises great good to the cause of temperance. The aim 
of such instruction should be to fortify the child against the formation of bad 
habits in his youth, and_to lay the foundations upon which to build the higher 
work of strengthening the will, so that he may be able to resist temptation from 
whatever source it may come. In this connection I am free to say that I believe 
there should be upon our statute book a law making it a misdemeanor, punish- 
able by a heavy fine, to sell tobacco in any form to a minor under 16 years of age. 
The necessity of such a law is becoming more apparent every day, and we ought 
not longer to delay its enactment. 
Statistics.—Reports from the township boards indicated ‘‘that the law had 
been complied with in its spirit” in every township without exception; also 
that the teachers were ‘‘skillful in giving the instruction required by law.” ’ 
In 1890, out of 15,762 schools, the effects of stimulants and narcotics were 
taught in 15,097. 
KANSAS, 
We should unite to make the teaching a success.—State Superintendent J. H. Law- 
head (1886): A vigorous mind inhabiting a healthy body can do more for the 
State than the same mind can in a body. that is weak and diseased; and as the 
public school is sustained at public expense upon the theory that the perma- 
nency of the State depends upon the intelligence of its citizens, the State claims 
the right to have those branches taught in her schools that will best secure 
these results. Now athorough knowledge of the human system is essential to 
its preservation and highest development, which can only be secured by a study 
of its physiology and hygiene, and the effects of such substances‘as may be dele- 
terious to its growth and the healthy exercise of its various functions; and it has

been decided by the best medical authority, as well as fag universal aisyration 
of mankind, that both alcoholic stimulants and narcotics exert a baneful and de- 
structive influence, not only upon the body and its various functions, but it like- 
wise destroys the intellect and deadens the moral sensibilities. In view of all 
these results, we, as school officers and good citizens, should unite to make the 
teaching of the effects of alcoholic stimulants and narcotics upon the human 
system a success. We should supply our teachers with all the necessary appli- 
ances to secure the best results, and furnish our, schools with the best maps, 
charts; and books, to enable the teacher to perform his part inthis great work.

taken hold of this subject with an earnestness that is full ot promise for good” 
results. # 
MAINE. 
Obstacles to the execution of the law.—State Superintendent N. A. Luce reports 
- (1890): The results of the law requiring instruction in the hygienic effects of 
stimulants and narcotics have not been fully up to what was hoped and expected 
when enacted. Three obstacles have stood in the way of such results: 
1. In the smaller rural schools where failure has been most general, the in- 
competence of the teachers has been the cause of such failure. In such schools 
of necessity the instruction must be largely oral because of the primary charac- 
ter of those to be taught, and such instruction to be efficient presupposes teachers 
of higher professional ‘grade than is required to give instruction from text- 
books. Efficient oral work, except in rare cases, can be done only by those 
trained and practiced in such work. 
- 2. The unwillingness of parents to purchase text-books has hitherto been an 
almost insurmountable obstacle not confined to any class or grade of schools. 
While oral teaching in this as in other branches is most efficient with primary 
classes, it is otherwise with thoss more advanced. With these the text-book: is 
a necessity. 
3. The inertia of public opinion—a quite general feeling that this instruction 
‘is of minor importance—has not only been in nlarge measure the producing cause 
~ of the two obstacles already cited, but an obstacle in and of itself. Schools both 
in their instruction and supervision are quick to respond: to. the condition of 
public opinion. Had there been sharp public demand that every child in every 
school should be taught as the terms of the law require, a demand watchful and 
exacting, there can be little doubt that cases of utter ignoring of law would have 
been rare, and that pupils and teachers would everywhere have been ee by 
that demand. 
The first of these obstacies can be removed only by such reform in our system 
as will lift these poorer schools out of their present condition. The second has 
been largely removed by the furnishing of free books. The third will disappear 
only as the result of a ‘‘campaign-of education.” To bring this instruction up 
to the efficiency desired by those who believe in its vital importance, calls not 
for law but for labor. Law can not create public opinion, but public opinion will 
* compel the observance of law. Labor with teachers is needed to awaken them 
to deeper interest and more earnest effort; with scheol officers to force them to 
~ full exercise of their authority ; and especially with the people to educate them 
to an intelligent appreciation of the value of the results sought. Such labor is 
the privilege, and the duty as well, of those by whose efforts the law was en- 
acted and of all others who believe in its wisdom. / 
Siatisties.—In 1889, out of 3,894 ungraded schools, 2,557 had classes in physi- 
ology 
In 1890, out of 3,909 ungraded schools, 2,426 had classes in physiology. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Object and methods of the instr uction—Haaggerated statements to be avoided.—G. T. 
Pletcher, agent of the State board: This is required to be given in connection 
witl “physiology and hygiene, whichtare to include special instruction as to 
the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics on the human system.” 
Right and faithful teaching i in this line’ may prove of great value to the Com- 
monwealth, and the subject should secure careful consideration from school offi- 
cials and teachers. The reports of school committees seem to indicate that some 
effort is made in every town to comply with the requirements of the law. 
_ My personal observation convinees me that the methods and results are not 
satisfactory. Many teachers desire to do justice to the subject, but they plead,
-P-A-G-E-127

as an excuse for neglect, lack of time and knowledge. Perhaps a brief consid- 
eration of the object of the instruction may suggest a method. 
The teaching is to lead the child to form temperate habits of living. His 
knowledge of the danger of indulgence in the use of narcotics and intoxicants 
must lead to a.development and exercise of will power sufficient to enable him 
to resist temptation. The education must be intellectual and moral, to induce 
the habits of thought and action necessary to good citizenship. The instruction 
should be true, simple, and earnest, largely objective; illustrations may be 
drawn from life, pictures, and recorded facts. Personalities and allusions that 
will wound the feelings of children should be avoided. No exaggerated state- 
ments of the evils to be shunned should be made; they are not wholly true, and 
they will react against the cause. 
For young pupils good temperance stories are valuable. I aminclined to think 
that most temperance teaching should be oral, the school being supplied with 
such books and charts as will be helpful to teacher and pupils for reference. 
Truths from scientific investigations, and facts and figures from other reliable — 
sources, may prove valuable. Not so much for school as for life the children 
need temperance instruction, and the teacher should honestly, faithfully, as well 
as intelligently, endeavor to make lasting impressions. 
Begin with the teachers.—State board of education: The statutes -require that 
physiology and hygiene shall be taught in all the public schools as a regular 
branch of study, and that the teaching shall have special reference to the effect 
of stimulants and narcotics upon the human system. The board has instructed 
its agents to make particular inquiry as to the manner in which this require- 
ment is met. They report that the disposition is very general to comply with 
the law, but that very much of the teaching under this head is defective and of 
little value, owing to the inability of teachers to deal with the subject. In the 
judgment of the board, therefore, especial attention must be given to the train- 
ing of teachers to teach this branch of learning before the results expected from 
its introduction into the schools will be produced. 
MICHIGAN, im 
Overteaching is perilous.— State Superintendent Theodore Nelson (1886): In my 
opinion it is the design of the law to give to this class of studies the same status 
it gives to other practical topics, such as reading or grammar, i. ¢., that some- 
where in his course the pupil shall be taught the physiological and moral effects 
of narotics and alcoholic stimulants upon the whole being of man. To my mind 
this is quite enough. Less would be insufficient; more would be unnecessary, 
and possibly harmful. It is to be regretted that in any public school the full 
requirements of the law should suffer neglect; yet it would be a mistake quite 
as serious to give to these special studies a disproportionate, unequal place in 
the school curriculum—to codrdinate them, as some extremists insist upon doing, 
with every other subject from the low zones of a, b, c up to the high regions of 
calculus. Overteaching upon a subject which relates to moral conduct, espe- 
  cially if it concerns the appetites or passions, is really perilous. Too constant — 
dwelling upon topics of this character has a tendency to invoke morbid condi- 
tions in the mind of the youth which either provokes or fascinates him to 
attempt dangerous experiments. Were you to teach a boy the flagrant wicked- 
ness of burglary it would not be expedient, nor would it be necessary, to induct 
him into the mysteries of picking a lock. The specialist finds a peculiar charm 
in the ugly spider; he sees a thousand beauties in the bright colors and sinister 
eyes of a loathsome snake. We may well fear the consequences of making our 
boys and girls too familiar with nauseating details of any evil which we desire 
them to'shun. The teacher or parent can not be too earnest to enjoin correct 
principles, to give warning of penalties, and to himself exhibit a blameless ex- 
ample; which having done he can effeetively add nothing further, except to 
devoutly leave the result with God. 
Statistics.—In 1890, out! of 10,810 school districts, 5,701 reported physiology

Temperance in the broader sense.—State Superintendent D. L. Kiehle (1888): 
The reports from the counties indicate a purpose to honestly exceute the law. 
The subject is doubtless as well taught as others are. The children are easily.

interested, and I have no doubt will derive much permanent good through the 
skill and example of good teachers. Nothing should be left undone that will 
fix in the minds of our youth a sense of the folly and danger of the use of alco- 
holic beverages, and a resolution to entirely abstain from their use. I therefore 
cordially support this law, and have, so far as I know, used every means to ad- 
minister it thoroughly. It ought, however, to be noted in a report upon educa- 
tion, as this assumes to be, that temperance in the restricted sense of abstinence 
from the use of any kind of food or drink is in itself but a negative virtue, and 
must therefore in an educational view take a subordinate place in any curricu- 
lum of instruction. Character is determined by what a man is, and not by what 
he is not, by what he does, and not by what he does not do. Hence, education 
having to do with the whole man in his health, intelligence, and character, it 
has chiefly to do with the positive virtues of temperance in the broader sense of 
self-control and the subordination of appetite and passion to the authority of the 
higher moral and intellectual natures, of high purposes in choosing worthy ob- 
~ jects of life, of pure tastes in the love of the good, the beautiful, and the true. 
These receiving the first place,a secondary consideration should in reason be 
given to what is destructive and inconsistent with what every wise man should 
be, and for what he should live. 
Reports of county superintendents—(1890). 
Anoka County.—No opposition has been made to the instruction in temperance 
hygiene. Both teachers and pupils seem to enjoy this subject. Anatomical 
charts have been purchased for about two-thirds of all the schools. ‘The great- 
est difficulty seems to be in getting parents to supply the children with books. 
. Douglas County.—Instruction in temperance hygiene has been systematically 
and regularly given in all schools, since the law requiring it became operative. 
The books recommended by the commission have been used exclusively and 
have given the best of satisfaction. 
Lac qui Parle County.—No objection to the teaching of this subject in the 
. schools has been heard. In nearly all of the schools it is taught, and I believe 
there is no subject more entertaining to the little ones, or one that will be of 
more importance to them in their general education. The teachers in nearly 
all of the schools use the book recommended by the commissioner. 
Meeker County.—Temperance hygiene has been taught in every school without 
exception. In some instances, however, threats had to be resorted to in order 
to induce school boards to do their duty in this respect. All the teachers have 
been loyal and active in doing their parts in fulfilling the law. 
Redwood County.—The temperance hygiene work is quite satisfactory. Teach- 
ers feel the need of good, earnest work on this subject. Nearly all make place 
for iton their programme. Some try it on the three times a week plan. What 
have we accomplished in the work, no one can tell. _We shall know more five 
years hence. 
Swift County.—Temperance hygiene has found a place on every programme 
“in our schools, and the law is well observed. 
Wilkin County.—Instruction in temperance hygiene has been given in this 
county, I think, very thoroughly and has been met with no opposition. 
MISSOURI. 
The law a farce and a fraud.—The law on teaching the evil effects of alcoholic 
stimulants and narcotics upon the human systemis afaree and fraud. Itis virtu- 
ally a prohibition against temperance instruction in the public schools. And 
strange as it may appear, those who claimed to favor proper legislation upon this 
subject, favored this measure, while they rejoiced over the defeat of Senate bill 
No. 52, which required such instruction in all schools of the State. The law asit 
standsis worthless, and should be repealed or amended, . (State Superintendent 
W. E. Coleman.) ‘ 
MONTANA. 
Montana without a luw.—State Superintendent John Gannon (1892): The only 
law upon our statute books relating to the teaching of the effects of stimulants 
and narcotics is that known as the ‘‘ Blair bill,” approved May 20, 1886; but as 
that applied only to the Territories, it became void upon the admission of Mon- 
tana into the Union, and has not been reénacted by our legislature; though”

teachers are still examined in ‘‘ physiology and hygiene, with special reference 
to the nature and the effects of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics upon the 
human system.” 
Statistics (1890).—Out of three hundred and sixty-one school districts in the 
State, physiology and hygiene were taught in three hundred and thirty-six. 
NEVADA, 
Scientific knowledge necessary.—State Superintendent W. C. Dovey (1890): The 
legislature passed an act in 1885 which provides that elementary physiology and 
hygiene, which shall give special prominence to the effect of alcohol and narcot- 
ics upon the human system, shall be taught in the public schools. No wiser - 
provision is found in our school law. Scientific knowledge on this subject, 
though very primary, will do more in shaping the habits of the children in this 
respect than can be done by appeals to his moral nature or by reviewing the ter- 
rible degradation and ruin which its use has inflicted upon the human family. 
Reasons, stronger than sentimentalism, excite in him a wise fear of the tippler’s 
habit. The following figures show that the great body of our teachers are in 
hearty accord with this law: Number of children studying physiology in 1885, 
365; in 1886, 851; in 1887, 1,602; in 1888, 2,150; in 1889, 2,265; in 1890, 2,283 
[out of 7,387 pupils enrolled]. In six years the number has increased from 365. 
to 2,283. This item is a source of thankful congratulation to every intelligent 
friend of the rising generation. 
‘NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
Nearly all schools complying with the law.—State Superintendent J. W. Patterson 
(1890): In the year 1883 an act was passed, without any material opposition in~ 
either house, which required school boards to prescribe in all schools sufficiently 
advanced the study of physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the ef- 
fects of alcoholic stimulants and narcotics upon the human system. To prevent 
evasion by those not favorable to the law, it was amended in 1887 so as to require _ 
the introduction of this study in ‘‘all mixed schools and in all graded schools 
above the primary.” 
Being deeply interested in the execution of the law, I endeavored to inform 
myself as to how far it had been complied with and the spirit with which the 
subject was taught. It took a year or two to qualify the teachers to do even re- 
spectable work in this branch. There were a few towns which ignored the law, 
as every sensible man knew there would be, and there were others that complied 
with the letter of the law and violated its spirit. But as time went on I was 
gratified with what seemed to me as general a compliance with the law as any 
one had reason to anticipate. > 
I was, therefore, greatly surprised and not alittle annoyed when his excellency 
the governor, in his inaugural, stated that so far as he could learn the law had 
been ‘‘almost entirely disregarded.” I said to myself, either Iam mistaken or 
the governor has been misinformed, and the public has a right to know whether 
the law is a dead letter or not. I therefore inserted the following questions in 
the statistical blanks sent to the school boards for their annual returns: 1. Give 
number of schools in which physiology and hygiene are taught with text-book. 
2. Give number of schools in which they are taught orally. 
All but eight towns in the State responded to these questions, and the result 
is as follows: In 946 schools physiology and hygiene are taught by text-books, 
and in 817 they are taught orally. This gives us 1,763 schools out of 2,302 in 
the State in which the law has been regarded, leaving only 539 in the whole 
State in which the subject is not taught. This number would be considerably 
reduced by the statistics from the eight towns not heard from. It is gratify- 
ing to learn from the school boards, who know the facts, that nearly all the 
schools of the State, except the primary, in which the subject is not required to 
be taught, are complying with the requirements of the law. Clearly his excel- 
lency the governor, whose scrupulous loyalty to facts and fearless fidelity to the 
cause of temperance all men must respect, was misinformed by parties who pre- 
sumed_to advise on matters in respect to which they had no definite knowledge. 
I do not claim that the subject is taught with great thoroughness in some of 
the schools, but I presume it is up to the average teaching in other studies in 
those schools. The limitations are in the qualifications of the teachers, and 
will be removed. with their improvement.

PENNSYLVANIA. 
Such knowledge is of vast account.—State Superintendent E. E, Higbee (1885): 
In regard to the recent law requiring physiology and hygiene to be taught as 
part of the necessary curriculum of our public schools, a word here may not be 
out of place. Of course, where children can not read intelligently or with ease, 
it would be a monstrous perversion of ordinary common sense to expect them to 
_ use a text-book. Their instruction, to be such and not a farce, must be oral; 
- and such instruction must and ought to be given, properly adapted to the age 
and attainment of the pupil. In higher grades, text-books in full conformity 
with the meaning and purpose of the law should be used; and thus all pupils, 
whether of low or high grades, will receive instruction. Only enmity to the 
law can warrant such an interpretation as will defeat its own purpose, which 
plainly is, that all our children shall gain as much knowledge of physiology and 
hygiene as our common schools, with their limited sphere, can give, accom- 
panied at each step with a proper practical application of this knowledge in 
reference especially to the effects of alcohol and narcotics on the human system. 
Such knowledge is in itself of vast account; and such special application of it, 
in way of warning, properly belongs to the moral discipline which should char- 
vacterize all teaching, whether required by definite statute or not. The law- 
abiding habits of teachers and directors give abundant assurance that this law 
will be fully obeyed. We are willing that time shall demonstrate how far it 
may serve to remove one of the greatest curses that pollute social life. The 
fathers and mothers of this Commonwealth will be‘more than thankful for any- 
thing which may aid their children in keeping away from those temptations 
which they themselves so much fear, and from which so many of them have 
been made miserable and broken hearted. . 
In harmony with public sentiment—The right to impart such instruction unquestion- 
able.—State Superintendent E. E. Higbee (1886): The practical operation of the act 
of assembly requiring the subject of physiology and hygiene, with special ref- 
erence to the effects of alcohol and narcotics upon the human system, to be in- 
troduced in the schools as a legal branch of study, strengthens and confirms eur 
belief in the wisdom of the law. The act was approved April 2, 1885, and went 
into effect at the beginning of the school year, in June following. 
The commendable spirit in which the measure was so generally acquiesced in 
by the patrons of the schools, its prompt enforcement by directors, the earnest 
codperation of superintendents, and the wiliingness of the teachers to comply 
with its provisions by a ready performance of the duties required of them, offer 
an unanswerable argument in proof of the fact that such instruction given to the 
children in the public schools is in favor with the people, and in harmony with 
astrong and growing public’sentiment throughout the Commonwealth. 
There have been shortcomings in some instances and partial failures in oth- 
ers, but there are few indeed in comparison, and occasioned more, we believe, by 
a misunderstanding of the law’s requirements than by a disposition to evade its 
provisions. All things fairly considered, the friendsof the measure have cause 
for congratulation, and even the most sanguine and hopeful of its advocates can 
find much to commend in the work of the first year. 
The good results that will come from judicious and timely instruction in the 
subject will in the near future demonstrate the practicability of temperance 
eons. in the public schools, and will fully justify the policy of the course pur- 
sued. : 
The principles underlying moral instruction in the schools as a proper prepa- 
ration for good citizenship, as well as to afford protection and safety to the in- 
dividual, are pressing themselves more forcibly to-day than ever before upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION, 723 
earnest attention of our teachers. The causes, only too clearly discernible, that 
make such teaching an absolute necessity need not here be referred to. 
The right to impart such instruction can not be questioned with any degree of 
sincerity or consistency, and when made an imperative and lawful requirement 
by the State, it becomes the duty of all concerned to render willing obedience 
thereto. 
Gaining favor with teachers and pupils—State Superintendent E, E. Higbee 
(1888): Scarcely any difficulties have arisen in reference to the comparatively 
new study of physiology and hygiene made obligatory by law. The teachers at 
the outset, in preparing themselves for this work, have very naturally given 
themselves to the study as a science, and no doubt in many instances have made 
this s0 prominent in their teaching as to overshadow the moral side in not fully 
discussing the vast evils of intemperance to both body and soul. In our judg- 
ment, however, there has been little if any conscious attempt to evade, in any 
way, the explicit requirements of the law, and the science, together with its 
hygienic applications, is gaining favor with teachers and pupils. 
There should be no indifference to the serious moral import involved in. such 
instruction. To avoid the evils of intemperance requires, of course, the firm 
exercise of will, which in most cases, when habits are already formed, needs the 
power of Divine grace to secure a lasting victory; yet it must be plain that a 
clear knowledge of the evils, as affecting body and soul, especially with the 
young, can but be of great service in helping them to shun the temptation when 
in subsequent years the tempter meets them-with his specious pleas. Prudent 
treatment of any vice is not only therapeutic in the way of applying remedies 
for the disease already in existence, but prophylactic as well in guarding against 
its threatened attack. 
General compliance with the law.—State Superintendent D. J. Waller, jr. (1890): 
The reports made to this office indicate a very genéral compliance with the 
spirit as well as with the letter of the law. The penalty for failure to comply 
with its provisions has proven to be sufficient to secure obedience on the part of 
those not specially interested in the subject. 
Aninstance ofharmful legislation— Results oppositeto what intended.—Superintend- 
entC. F. Foster, of Chester, Delaware Co.,(1891): With all respect for the philan- 
trophic and Christian women who have secured the present scientific temperance 
law,wecan only characterize it, after a thorough test of six years ina strict observ- 
ance of all its details,as an instance of harmful legislation. _We have followed 
its requirements to the letter. "We have used only the authorized text-books. 
Every grade, from first primary tohigh school, is taught physiology and hy- 
giene, ‘‘ including special reference to the effect of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, 
and narcotics*upon the human system.” The result upon the minds of the pupils, 
and too often upon their personal habits, is the opposite of what was intended. 
The way in which this effect is produced, for aught we know, may be that illus- 
trated in the oft-repeated lines of Pope: 
* Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, 
As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; 
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace.” 
It is certain that a repetition of any precept, whether in abstract or concrete 
form, during twelve or thirteen years of a school course, must produce weari- 
ness and eventually disgust in the pupil’s mind, and that the natural perversity 
of the human heart will, in not a few cases, assist to produce a revulsion in senti- 
ment and practice. I am ready to affirm that in this community the evils which 
this legislation aims to check are constantly on the‘increase in spite of the most 
thorough temperance instruction in the schools, and thatthe bestresultsin this 
linehave been reached by a few teachers, who, in a kindly, yet conservative way, 
have gained the confidence of their pupils, and by the voluntary organization of 
children in ‘‘bands” or “societies,” have kept them interested in the various 
features of moral and social reform. There can be no objection to the require- 
ment by which scientific temperance instruction is made a part of the public- 
school course within certain limits, but when it becomes like the image set up _ 
- in the plain of Dura, claiming universal homage, it is well to ask ‘‘ cui bono?”

session of the State legislature, of a bill, with stringent provisions, for teaching 
in our schools the facts concerning the nature and effects of alcoholic drinks 
and narcotics upon the human system. I am not able to state how universally 
in our schools the provisions of this law are complied with, butI aprehend that 
the matter has not received in all places the thorough attention from school of- 
ficers and teachers which it should. Its provisions are not too strict when we 
. consider the importance of the subject. 
After June 1, 1891, teachers are required by this law to be examined with 
special reference to their knowledge of the nature and effects of alcoholic drinks 
and narcotics. As the questions heretofore prepared by the state department 
have quite thoroughly covered. this ground, the teachers and schools are’pre- 
sumably in full harmony with the spirit of this law, and the only change will be 
that of the text-books that do not comply with the provisions of the statute. _

Let the children be taught to form good habits.—State Superintendent Justus Dartt 
(1886): The startling fact that so large a number of school boys are forming the 
habit of using tobacco by smoking cigarettes, thus retarding physical develop- 
ment, disordering the nervous system, and weakening their mental power, is a 
sufficient incentive to all the effort that has been or can be put forth to forearm 
the children against this evil. Above all things else, let the children be taught 
to form good habits. 
V.—AN INQUIRY INTO THE RESULTS OF TEMPERANCE TEACHING 
IN MASSACHUSETTS. 
REPORT OF GEORGE H. MARTIN, AGENT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
__ [The following report of Mr. Martin was taken from the Massachusetts School 
Report of 1890-91, pp. 312-326.] G 
Under the law of 1885,’ which requires physiology and hygiene, with special 
reference to the effects of stimulants and narcotics, to be taught as a regular 
branch to all pupils.in all. schools, there is great diversity of practice. I have 
made it a subject of special inquiry, and have gathered a large amount of ma- 
+ terial in the form of written papers. These papers have been furnished by the 
    most advanced classes in the grammar schools. The pupils have been asked to 
write for me what they could recall concerning the effects of alcohol and tobacco 
on the human body. ‘They were not required to put their names to the papers, 
so that they wrote without constraint, usually taking all the time they wanted. 
To judge of the work most intelligently, one should read all the papers; but in 
this report I can use only enough to illustrate the classes of work, or special 
features of the instruction. Read with the allowance which all written papers 
need, they are useful. They are printed as written. 
The cities and towns within my inspection may be roughly grouped in four 
e.asses: (1) those in which oral instruction is given during three or four years 
of school, with the use of text-books during the remainder of the course, from 
four to six years; (2) those using text-books only in the last one or two years, 
confining all earlier work to oral instruction; (3) those using no text-books, 
put having regular oral instruction throughout; (4) those having only oral in- 
struction, of an occasional, desultory sort. The first three classes might each 
be subdivided into those having regular oral and written examinations, and 
those having none. For the use of the teachers in giving oral instruction one 
or more books are usually furnished, from which the teachers gather material 
for talks, or from which they read. 
Of the work of the schools in the fourth class, it is perhaps enough to say that 
it does not meet the requirements of the law. Physiology is to be taught as 
1The Massachusetts act of 1885-provides that per olay and hygiene, which, in both divi- 
sions of the subject, shall include special instruction as to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimu- 
lants, and narcotics on the human system, shall be taught as a regular branch of study to all 
pupils in all schools supported wholly or in part by public money, except special schools main- 
tained solely for instruction in particular branches, such as drawing, mechanics, art, and like 
studies. All acts or parts of acts relating to the qualifications of teachers in the public schools 
shall apply to the branch of study prescribed in this act, and all penalties now fixed for neglect 
2 Peeve instruction in the branches of study now prescribed by law shall apply to this branch 
of study.”

  2 SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 725° 
a ‘‘rvegular branch.” This can mean nothing less than it shall have a per- 
manent place in the programme of school exercises. How frequently the periods 
given to it shall recur, the law does not attempt to prescribe; but that they 
should recur at stated intervals, and frequent enough for teachers and pupils to 
consider them essential parts of the school exércises, there can be no doubt. 
The word occasional is so elastic that the results attained in schools of this 
class may vary widely. In some schools few facts have secured a lodgment in 
the pupils’ memory, though there is a decided impression of the harmful char- 
acter of alcohol; for example 
EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. 
The effects of alcohol is bad because it injures your health and body and ina 
little while it will kill you. When you are cold and take alcohol in Hquor it 
will warm you up for a while and in case of sickness the doctors will give it to 
you in liquor. . 
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL. 
Ihave heard that the effects of alcohol on the human body is a ruination to 
the person who uses it It burns the person in side and doen’t him any good but 
does himharm. They say it is good for medicine but I do not know. [ think 
we could get along with outit. If it is good they abuse it by puting it into in- 
toxicating drinks which is very injuriou to the human body. 
TOBACCO. 
Tf the persons smoke it will make cancers come on their lips and will make 
the cancer in the stomach. ‘Tobacco often leads to drinking. Tobacco issome- 
times made in filthy places and is not good for persons to use. 5

In other schools of this class the best pupils are are able to write as intelli- 
gently as when more formal work is done: 
Alcohol is a stimulant when taken in small quantities, in larger quantities it 
isanarcotic. Its immediate effect is exhilerating but after working through 
the system it stuneues the brain and makes the body unfit for use. It destroys 
many of the small glands of the stomach and alimentary canal and makes those 
that are left hard and ropy. It makes ulcers on the small intestines. It de- 
stroys pepsin which is the fluid that digests the food taken into the stomach, It 
makes the blood flow much faster than is necessary and consequently wears out 
the heart much quicker than it naturally would, It makes a mana beast, It 
in time takes the place of food, and makes the stomach a good pouch for hold- 
ing alcohol, but useless to digest food. The poison in tobacco is called nicotine, 
«a drop of this fluid will instantly kill adog. The general effect of tobacco is 
the same as that of alcohol although it is not so violent, it produces ulcers in 
the throat.   
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO ON THE HUMAN BODY. 
When a boy begins to smoke young his growth is stunted, his complexion is 
sallow, his teeth become yellow, and his breath bad. It also works on the brain. 
It does not effect one right off but by degrees The man who drinks a little at 
a time does not think he is doing any harm tohis body, but he is, His stomach 
is burning by degrees and finally when he becomes a drunkard he has no stomach 
at all, (so to speak). It works on his nerves and his muscles, and he finally looses 
all his power. 
The weaker ones have little to say, but contrive to express their feelings: 
ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. 
The effect of alcohol on the human system is to produce raw sores in the in- 
testine. In*time it produces a disease of the brain known as delirium tremens, 
A man who drinks intoxicating liquors is slowly poisoning himself and if he 
keeps on he will die. Tobacco contains a deadly poison called nicotine. When 
the young use it, it dwarfs the body more or less.

ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. 
Alcohol makes any one neryous and irritable. If any ono begins to drink, it 
is very-hard to leave off. It irritates the stomach and heart. 
In schools where the instruction is all oral, but regular, the pupils write more 
. fluently than in schools of the fourth class. Their knowledge of the subject 
is apt to be more comprehensive, but it is still general. The effort to be specific 
is not often successful : 
THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM. 
Alcohol is one of the worst enemies of mankind, yet many people, falling into 
the habit of drinking this disastrous spirit, could not live without it. If they 
could see the picture of their system before and after using the alcohol they 
would not care to drink another drop. When it passes down the throat it burns 
off the'skin leaving it bare and burning. It causes the heart to beat many un- 
necessary times and after the first dose the heart is in danger of giving out 80 
that it needs something to keep it up and therefore the person to whom the 
heart belongs has to take drink after drink to keep his heart going. This un- 
necessary work soon wears the heart out. The liver is also effected by alcohol. 
Before the use of it, the liver is smooth and velvety. After long use of it, the 
liver is turned to a different color, and there are large pimples growing out on 
it. These look like nails.and the liver is called “Hob nail live    
   
     
     
    THE EFFECT OF ALCHOHOL ON THE SYSTEM. 
Alchehol poisons the human system. After a man has been drinking-alchohol 
his brain becomes cloudy and he is unfit for work. Many people think that al- 
choholic drinks help men to do their work better, but after they get used todrink- 
ing alchoholic drinks, it is hard for them to work without it, and they do not do 
their work so well. . 
Statements like the following abound in the average papers: ‘‘ Makes the mind 
dizzy ;” ‘‘ The skin on the organs cracks out:” ‘Before alcohol is put into the 
hody, the liver is soft and flat, but after a person drinks it for two or three years, 
that organ becomes hard and full of holes like a sponge, and instead of being 
flat, it is round ;” ‘‘ Every drop that is taken rushes to two little cups in the 
brain.” The more illiterate pupils here, as in the other schools, are firmly im- 
pressed that alcohol is an evil. 
Alcohol, to those who drink it makes great blotches on your face, and makes 
itred. If you drink much of it, it will make you drunk. ‘its males your liver 
like leather, and is called the hob-nailed liver. It affects your whole bedy and 
makes you dic sooner. It affects your heart the most. 
THE EFFECT OF ALCHOALL ON THE HUMAN SYSTOM. * 
When aman gets adrinking rum, which contains alchoall, it goes to his brain, 
and makes him unsenseable. Alchoall will quicken the pults, and the hart will 
beat faster than usual Alchoall is poision, and will poision the blood. 
In some schools the moral and social side of the drink question seems to be 
made more prominent in the oral instruction than the physiological side. Some 
of the best papers, from a literary standpoint, are from these schools. Such are 
the following, which are scarcely better than the average of the whole class: 
THE USE OF ALCOHOL. 
Alcohol is a spirit of wine. It is very injurious to the system, and sometimes 
causes paralysis of the nerves, which also leads to blindness. The use of alcohol 
by grown up people, sets a bad example to the young, who surely can not help 
‘from seeing intoxicated men and sometimes women staggering along the street. 
It seems as if young people might resist the temptation of what they know will 
be an injury to them, when they see the effects; poverty, cruelty, murder, sui- 
cide and. many others. 
A man who comes home under the influence of alcohol, with his mind dazed, 
is often cruel to his family, and what might be a happy home is an unhappy one, 
on account of the father’s habit of drink.

SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. ~ Tat. 
In many homes wine is on the table daily, and the children see it drank before 
them, and some are even allowed to taste it. 
I think the whole country suffers from it, and it should be put down as it has 
in some places. Attempts have Feen made in Boston, but the prohibitionists 
have not suecceded. Some of the business men say it will hurt business, but I 
should like to have it tried. “ 
THE USE OF ALCOHOL. 
Alcohol is a kind of ardent spirit: It will paralyze the nerves when taken as- 
adrink. Alcohol is generally used to putin drinks, such as rum, ale, and lager. © 
When once a man begins to drink things in which alcohol is put, it is very © 
hard for him to stop, A man who drinks, almost invariably, is robbing his fam- 
ily of the money which they aught to have and which he is spending for his 
cravings of liquor. 
It is bne of the great topics of the day whether or not drinks, which contain 
alcohol shall be sold, made or imported into this country. 
Young men who begin to drink dg it because they think it a smart thing 
They do not look forward to what will become of them when they grow up to be 
men. »They perhaps do not think or know that nations have been ruined by this 
curse. 
Every day this curse is getting a stronger hold on our nation, Every day it 
is growing larger and larger. Shall we allow this curse toruin our nation. No! ~ 
Somehow it must be stopped but how. ‘ 
THE USE OF ALCOHOL, 
The pure alcohol is a liquid of about the color of water. The Bible says ‘It 
piteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder.” 
It is mixed with wine and sold to people as a beverage. To such people the © 
ordinary food is not strong enough to satisfy their appetites. They sometimes 
eat garlic with their food. 
A liquor saloon is a very poor thing to have ina community. It is generally 
brilliantly lighted in the evening to attract the young men. They will stay 
away from home for the sake of being in this gay company. They may loose 
their position in business if found intoxicated. It is the ruin of aman to take 
liquor as a beverage. 
Drunkenness leads to many evils. When intoxicated murder may be com- 
mitted, rash acts, stealing, and sometimes suicide. 
A large partof the money spent in the Union is for liquor, wines, and tobacco. 
Good could be done in every way with the money spent for these purposes. 
In the effort to have the pupils receive their information in more definite 
form and retain it, some teachers arrange the leading physiological facts in 
form and order and require the pupils to memorize the statements. In classes 
_ where this practice obtains, the papers are essentially alike : Z 
Alchohol isa drug of very great power It weakens the nervous system and 
often leads to paralysis. It causes a disease of the liver, stomach and kidneys, 
and often leads to dyspepsia, which is caused by indigestion. It lessens the 
mental powers, so, that a child using would not be able to learn or think as quick 
as he otherwise would. It often dwarfs the body. 
It weakens the whole nervous system and often causes paralysis, epilepsy or 
insanity. When used insmall quantities it is a stimulant, when used -in large 
quantities it is a narcotic. 
The higher faculties‘are first paralyzed leaving the victim under his lower and 
meaner nature. 
Alchohol weakens the muscles of the heart causing it to beat more rapidly, 
distending the blood-vessels, and overcharging them with blood. 
Alcohol, irritates, weakens, and inflames the stomach, liver, and kidneys and 
often causes fatal diseases in these organs. .

    es EFFECTS OF TOBACCO ON THE SYSTEM, 
Tobacco is very injurious to the young and no child which uses it is ever-a 
good scholar. It dwarfs the body and lessens the mental power when first used. 
by the young it makes them feel sick, stupid and drowsy, and gives them a yel- 
lowish or sallow look. It hurts the action of the heart, persons using it are 
hardly ever if ever healthy. Tobacco. isa drug of very great power, a drop oil 
extracted from it placed on a dogs tongue will kill him nearly as quick as spru- 
cid asic. 
EVIL EFFECTS OF TOBACCO. 
Tobacco is a drug of very great power a drop of oil exacted from it placed on 
- 2a dog’s tongue would kill him nearly as prusic asid. 
Tobacco when used by young is always injurious. It oftens duarfs the body 
and always lessens the mental powers. No child usuing it is ever as‘good a 
scholar as he otherwise would be. 
Tobacco also causes diseases of mouth and throat. 
_ Passing to consider the schools where text-books are used for a longer or 
shorter time, the character of the papers presented seems to depend more on 
the general character of the school and the ability of the pupil than on the num- 
ber of years spent in the study of alcohol. 
If we select a number of schools in which the subject is studied from text-books 
one, two, three, or more years, we shall find the best papers presented will cover 
essentially the same facts in all the schools. On the other hand, the average 
papers, after one year’s use of the book, may be better than other schools will 
furnish after five or six years’ study. For example: 
A.—Text-book one year; two lessons a week. 
EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL. 
Aleohol at first acts as a stimulant, but when the stimulant has spentits force 
it leaves the body in a very weak condition It paralyzes the nerve centres, and 
causes a fatty deposit around the heart and enlargement of the liver. When 
alcohol is first taken into the system it quickens the action of the heart and 
afterwards leaves it very weak so that it cannot perform its work properly 
Continued use of alcohol produces delirium tremens which sometimes ends in 
death. The appetite for alcohol may be inherited In persons who use it the 
nerves are so weak that they cannot resist the temptation to drink. 
B.—Text-book one year; four lessons a week. 
EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM. 
When a person first tastes any alcoholic liquor, as a rule, they do not like it ; 
but they often try it again just to see if they don’t like it. Gradually they learn 
to like it. Some persons drink to such excess that their whole system is sat- 
_ urated with liquor and it would kill them to go without. 
Alcohol weakens the muscles and makes them flabby. When alcohol is first 
taken into the system it exhilarates the person and makes them lively; but it 
soon produces a stupor. Alcohol weakens the heart, so that itis not able to 
perform its work thoroughly. It eats out the coats of the stomach, and of course 
the stomach is not able to perform its work of digesting the food thoroughly, 
thus causing indigestion. Nothing will quench the thirst of a man who drinks 
alcohol but alcohol. s

< EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM. 
Alcohol drys the blood, weakens the mind, deadens the nerves, causes sick- 
ness, sores, cancers and in every way weakens and poisons the body. It hasa 
‘great craving for water and therefore it takes the most necessary thing from 
our body. It weakens the blood-vessels so much that the blood, which flows 
with much force when alcohol has been taken into it, burst them, this causing 
death. The blood often stagnates in the blood-vessels near the skin, causing it 
to have a red appearance.
-P-A-G-E-137
SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
It weakens the mind, causing the victim to stagger. It also puts one in such 
a@ way as to murder, steal and to even worse things. The man does know he is 
doing anything because the alcohol has weakened his mind so much that he 
does not think. ; : 
The liver, stomach, lungs, and intestines are weakened and poisoned more or 
less. : 
The teeth have a soiled appearance, and the gums are spungy. The breath 
also has a disagreeable odor. 
The habit of drinking alcoholic drinks often leads to insanity. 
D.—Text-book five years; two lessons a week during last two years. 
PHYSIOLOGY. 
Alcohol in any form, is very injurious to the body. Young children should 
never use it, because it checks their groath. It weakens the brain, and makes 
them seem very stupid at times. 
People who begin to use it, and think it will do them no harm, find out in 
after years that it has power over them, and they cannot control their appetite. 
It also makes them have an uncontrolable temper. 
Alcohol hurts the stomach very much. Without realy giving strength, they 
give a feeling of strength and confidence. Their sensibilities become lively 
Alcohol often causes paralysis and insanity, and often enlarges the small blood- 
vessels. People who use alcohol have very impure blood. 
E.—Text-book three years; two lessons a week: written examinations. 
EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL ON THE SYSTEM. 
Alcohol is the fermentation of fruits and grains. The different liquors made 
from it are cider, beer, wine, whisky, brandy, and gin. Alcohol is a clear color- 
less fluid and is lighter than water. Alcohol could not be a food for the body 
because it does not nourish the body. The alcohol makes the person dry and 
want to drink a good deal after using it. It also takes water from other parts 
of the body where it is needed. It turns the blood to water, and it does not sat- 
isfy the hunger because hunger needs solid food to satisfy that, and it does not 
help to digest the food. It does not keep the body warm as some persons:think 
it does It flushes the face, deadens the body.and makes the face red and bloated. 
Alcohol poisons the stomach and bowels. When the person first commences to 
use this for a drink it makes him sick to his stomach, and the food does not 
agree with them. And after awhile the stomach gets diseased and flamed and 
the person dies. Alcohol might be looked upon as a medicine and never should 
be used for any other use. Itis areal poison and if persons regarded it so the 
better their health would be. It is a cause of thousands of peoples death and 
nervous diseases. And children inherit bad habits, and are likely to be weak 
minded.

  THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM. 
When alcohol is first. taken, it goes first to the stomach, where it does its first 
harm. It begins to absorb the gastric juice, so that there will not be enough to _ 
mix the food. Then it is carried into:the blood, which it poisens. Then it dces 
a great harm in the brain. It destroys the nerves centered there, and so the 
person that takes the poisen, does not feel the cold or heat as he ought. The 
alcohol in the blood, makes the flesh look bloated and discolored. Sometimes 
persons grow crazy from the effect of strong drink. So, we see what a great 
harm it does.

EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE HUMAN SYSTEM. 
  Alcohol is very injurious to the human system. It effects every part of it. It 
‘stops the growth of the bones. It makes unhealthy fat on the muscles so that 
they cannot work with much force and are not soelastic. It enters the stomach 
and does ‘great harm there. It separates the pepsin from the gastric juice and 
makes sores all over the stomach. It gets into the blood and makes it impure, 
and also injures the blood vessels. In the lungs it injures the thin membrane 
or lining to the them and makes the breath smell bad. The heart is a muscle 
so that it injures that in much the same way as other muscles and also makes it 
work harder. 
The nerves and brain are also injured. Alcohol deadens the nerves and often 
people will do things when intoxicated that they would think very wrong when 
sober. Alcohol also.causes consumption instead of curing it as some people 
think. If children have drinking parent they often weak and sometimes 
‘idiots. Alcohol is used by some people because they think that it will warm 
them but it does not only for a little while then they are colder than before. It 
has been found that people can work better without alcohol than with it. 
3 THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL. 
(a) The effect of alcohol is that of a narcotic; it destroys character, destroys 
the vital functions of the body & has the effect of a slow poison. 
(b) The action of the heart is increased & “‘ fatty heart” is often the result. 
(c) The lungs are affected by having more work & the influence of bad sur- 
roundings. 
(d) The bones are affected by having their growth stunted by poor blood & the 
injuring of the pieroistum. 
_ {e) The blood as the life fluid is affected by a loss of red corpuscles, the minute 
bodies which carry oxygen, & from this loss comesa disease knownas Aneamia; 
Of course there is a large increase of fat which is entirely useless. 
(f) The effect upon the brain in slight does; asa glass or two ata fashionable 
pall, is to increase or stimulate the action of the cerebrum. In larger doses the 
nerves are deadened or the person is hateful & finally sleeps it off. Inaregular 
spree Delirum Tremins is often the result. 
ta) All the senses are deadened. 
{h) 'The pepsin in the gastric juice is separated from it, & sinks to the bottom 
of the stomach, stopping digestion till more can be thrown in & digestion com- 
pleted. The lining is also irrated to the extent of cancers & sores. 
~ (i) The liyer becomes of an immense size, swollen, or “‘ hob-nailed.” Alsoa 
bad secretion of bile. 
(j) An extra growth of the connective tissue is caused in the muscles. 
The last two papers are from a school where the instruction has been most 
thorough and systematic, and continued through the longest period ; probably 
in no town in the State has more time been given to the subject. 
These are specimens of the best papers; from them the others shade down to 
almost zero; for example, in schools where a text-book has beenstudied for five 
_ years many of the pupils can write but two or three lines:

In many of the country schools the amount of information retained and realy 
for use is very small. The poorer scholars, whose deficiency is marked by faulty 
English, are often stronger in their expressions than the more cultivated pupils: 
ALCORHALL. 
Allliquor contanes alcharhall. It poisions the syliava and the gastrit juice 
when it mixes withe the food it stops the works and the food layes in the stomacke, 
which causes it to ache. When the juice mixes with the blood it poisons it. 
Next the man is sick with blood poison and dies and the people wonder what 
made him have that. t 
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL. 
Alcohol is another very injurious thing to the body. It is very injurious to 
the heart especially and there area great many men that die from the use of 
alcohol sooner than those thatdon’t. Some men go crazy from the use of alcohol 
or they are called delireum tremans, and a great many men the have used al- 
cohol have become ministers and their advice to boys or anybody not to use 
alcoholic drink’s. 
Alcohol is very bad for the stomach and is good for the head ack and it is 
a strong smell and It will stop any one from fainting. 
THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL, 
It will gradually eat away the flesh. If any one drinks it, it will pickel the 
inside of the body. 
THE EFFECT OF TOBACCO ON THE HUMAN SISTEM. 
The effect of tobacco on the sistem it deadens the brain and the user it is said 
to have a sore heart which in the gets clogded and they die quicker than if they 
did not use it. it softens the brain. 
In schools where the text-book is begun early, I have sometimes called for 
papers from the sixth grade, a class which has used books for two or three 
years. Here the amount of information retained is usually scanty, and in crude 
form. The following are the best papers from school I, sixth grade: 
EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL. 
Alcohol weakens the body and makes the heart beat too fast, it also makes the 
blood-vessels enlarge and weakens the walls of the blood-vessels, “ 
Alcohol makes a man have a red face because when the blood-vessels enlarge 
they show out. 3 
When alcohol is taken into the system it makes poor circulation. The brain 
wants good blood but when alcohol is taken it does not receive it. When alco- 
hol is taken the brain cannot send the messages so well. Livinstone found that 
in Africa that the men could do better without it and could endure more heat. 
And in the Artic Regions the explorers can do better without it because when 
they take alcohol they ds not know so much and can do great deal better with

_ out.» A man said once that he would not have any alcohol used in his factory 
because they did not work so well, and if any did use it he would discharge them. 
Boone! also makes the muscles weak and fat so that they cannot work so 
well. 
_ Ifa person once takes some alcohol ‘he will keep wanting more because his 
appetite for it is so strong. 
ALCOHOL ON THE’ BODY. 
When a man drinks the first glass he cannot stop but wants more It burns 
his stomach and fills the blood vessels so full with the watery substance that 
they cannot bear the strain so sometimes an artery breaks and death occurs in- 
stantly. 
rnc one-fifth of all the water that is in the body is in the head around the 
£0't fibers of the brain and the alcohol mixes with it and takes it away from 
where it is needed. It deadens his nerves so that the messages do not obey and 
he does not know what he is doing. Many people are in prison for murder or 
some other wicked thing because they are under the influence of licquer. 
A story is told of a great murderer who was about to kill a baby when the lit- 
tle creature looked up in his face and smiled so he did not like to kill it, so he, 
took a glass of brandy and he did not care. 
Insurance men will not insure the lives of licquer sellers because they are most 
always beer drinkers. 
Some times when a person is dying the doctor gives him alcohol to make his 
penet beni taster till he can give him some other medicine and thus som:times 
Save his lite. 
From school H, sixth grade, the following are the best: 
The effects that alcoho! has on the body is that it poison the blood, and hard- 
‘ens the albuem of the brain, just as it hardens the egg as if it was boiled, and it 
does harden the brain, so that we can not think as we could if we did not drink 
the alcohol, and it hurts the heart because it makes the heart beat to fast be- 
eause heart wants to drive it out quick, and this wears the heart out, and so we 
know alcohol does harm to the body. ; as 
Alcohol poisons the blood and hurts the brain so it is not able to think well, 
It. poisons the heart and lungs it makes people stuid and they don’t don’t walk 
straight. And it makes them have diseases 
Sometimes it makes the heart stop beating and then they die. Alcohol makes 
them so stuid that they do not know what they are doing part of the time. 
Alcohol makes bad blood and bad blood makes poor bones. Alcohol makes 
them unhealthy and so shortens their lifes. When people first begin to drink 
aleohol it seems bitter, but they keep on and so get used to it. 
I have culled the following statements of the effects of alcohol on the stomach 
and brain from a large number of papers. Most of them are from the better 
class of papers, as the poorer scholars make few specific statements: ‘It separ 
rates the pepsin from the gastric juice, an ales sores all over the stomach ;” 
‘Destroys the fine membrane that lines it;” ‘‘Inflames the lining of the stom- 
ach ;” Inflames the sides, and changes the pinkish lining to a bright red ;” ‘‘ By 
taking the gastric juice from the stomach, so the stomach has no juice to aid in 
digesting the food;” ‘“‘Inflames the membrane, and causes sores to come in- 
side ;” ‘It uses up all the tissues lining around the stomach, and it uses all the 
saliva in the body so that we cannot digest the food ;” ‘‘ Will make the lining of 
the stomach fat;” “The pepsin in the gastric juice is separated from it, and 
sinks to the bottom of the stomach ;” ‘‘Takes the gastric juice of the lining and 
turns the lining into fat;” ‘‘Irritates the lining, and takes the water from the 
gastric juice;” ‘‘The alcohol in the system lies at the bottom of it until the 
glands can pour in enough gastric juice to dissolve the alcohol;” ‘‘ Burns the 
stomach so as to raise little blisters on the inside of it;” ‘Eats the lining ;” 
‘“‘Burns off the coating ;” ‘‘ Makes cancers come in the system;” ‘‘ Makes the 
lining of the stomach tough ;” ‘‘His stomach becomes black, and covered with 
cancers. The moderate drinker’s stomach is not quite so black ;” ‘‘ Hardens the 
mucuous membrane, so that the digestive juice can not get through ;” ‘‘Makes 
the gastric juice flow fast, until it becomes so weak it can not perform its part;” 
‘Causes the stomach to be dry and hard ;” ‘‘It draws the pores of the stomach

so tight that the first coating on the stomach is so hard that it can not per- 
spire ;” ‘‘ The stomach becomes coated with a sort of crust, and disease sets in ;” 
‘“Hinders the action, and makes.it look -like raw beef ;” ‘‘ Makes great sores in 
the stomach, because alcohol burns the stomach ;” ‘‘ Gastric juice becomes thick _ 
and ropy;” ‘‘The blood oozes out from the flesh. into the stomach ;”. ‘* Eats the 
stomach until, after a time, a man has no stomach at all, so to speak ;” ‘It hurts 
the brain by injuring the nerves, and often the nerves break, and people have 
apoplexy ;” ‘‘It causes more blood to go to the brain ;” ‘‘ When alcohol is taken, 
the brain can not send the messages so well ;” ‘‘About one-fifth of all the water 
in the body is in the head around the soft fibers of the brain, and the alcohol 
mixes with it and takes it away from where it is needed;” ‘‘About one-fifth of 
the blood is in the brain, and around the soft gray matter, and among the white ~ 
fibers are tiny blood vessels, and the blood vessels are injured from the drink- 
ing of alcohol, and then the blood sometimes becomes stagnant, and headaches 
often follow after a glass of liquor.” f 
I have endeavored to show as clearly as possible in a limited space the present | 
condition of the physiological work of the schools. To show the work com- 
pletely would necessitate printing all the papers. After a careful study of these 
papers, I am lead to the following conclusions, 1. The phrase, ‘‘scientific tem- 
perance instruction,” sometimes applied to this work, is a misnomer. 'There 
is, and in the nature of things can be, no such instruction. The two essential 
elements of scientificstudy—observation and inference—are necessarily wanting ; 
neither the pupil nor the teacher can have first-hand information; 2. That the 
outcome in accurate knowledge, resulting from much of the work done, is meager 
and out of proportion to the time spentuponit; 3, That many false impressions are 
left in the minds of the students; 4. That physiological details are not suited to 
young children; 5. That, however defective the instruction may be, the senti- 
ment of the schools is sound—the conviction that alcohol and tobacco are bad 
things to use seems universal; 6.-That the strength of this sentiment does not 
depend upon the amount of information acquired; 7. That, where exaggerated 
notions of the effects of stimulants have been acquired, there is danger of a re- 
action of sentiment in the light of after knowledge. From these conclusions I 
venture the following suggestions: 1. That committees and superintendents 
give more careful attention to work in this department, prescribing definitely 
its limits, and requiring the prescribed work to be done as well as work in other ~ 
subjects, using the same means for judging of its progress and results; 2. That 
teachers who are called upon to give oral instruction prepare themselves with 
great care for the exercise, and see that their statements are true, and by fre- 
quent tests, oral and written, ascertain that their teaching is intelligently com- 
prehended by all the pupils ; 3. That, when no text-book is used in any grade, 
the teachers prepare for the highest classes a summary of the effects of stim- 
ulants and narcotics upon the different systems of the body, aiming at clearness 
of statement, and avoiding exaggeration; 4. That the use of text-books be lim- 
ited to the older pupils; 5. That so much of explanation accompany the use of 
the book as may be necessary to guard against error and insure exact knowl- 
edge; 6. That, as far as possible, technicalities be avoided ; 7. That the pupils 
have frequent opportunities to express their knowledge orally and in writing; 
8. That throughout the course the moral and social effects of the use of intoxi- 
cants be made prominent, and abstinence be inculcated from higher ends than 
such as*concern only the body.

VI.—OBJECTIONS TO SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION 
STATED. 
SCIENCE IN HARNESS. 
[From the Popular Science Monthly, November, 1887.] 
No journal has upheld more steadily than the Popular Science Monthly the 
principle that, as far as they are established; the truths of science shall be ap- 
plied to useful purposes and through popular education be made as widely avail- 
able.as possible for the general guidance of life. And yet we can not look with 
favor upon what many persons doubtless regard as a very signal and happy ex- 
ample of the utilization of scientific conclusions. We mean the authoritative 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
      
    134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
-and dogmatic teaching as to the effects of aleohol nowprovided for by the school 
laws of many States. It is only right, therefore, that we should assign our rea- 
sons for holding that this is not a case of the legitimate application of scientific 
truths to practical life. - 
- In the first place, it is an abuse of power on the part of the majority. In the 
“temperance” controversy as a distinct social issue we have no wish to inter- 
‘fere ; but we can not ignore the fact that there is such a controversy, nor can 
we consent to believe, with the adyocates of prohibitory legislation, that their 
_ Opponents are necessarily persons devoid of all high motives and hardly to be 
distinguished from the criminal population. But if a minority in the State is 
to be respected so long as it is law-abiding, its opinions are also to be respected ; 
and to seize hold of the school machinery of the State to inculcate opinions that 
are not accepted by the minority, and that tend to set the minority in a very un- 
favorable light, is not right nor just. If every triumphant party were to seize the 
public schools for the inculeation of doctrines favorable to its own party inter- 
ests, there would soon be an end of our public-school system. Itwould always be 
easy to invoke the name of science. If it were desired to rear a race of protec- 
tionists, it would only be necessary to claim that you were teaching the truths 
of political economy. The proper text-books would be prepared, and teachers, 
on pain of dismissal, would have to enunciate the doctrines of Henry C. Carey 
and Horace Greeley; and so in the days of slavery, the science of ethnology 
might have been invoked either on the side of abolition or in defense of the 
slave system, according to the leaning of the majority. Atthismomentwehave 
the president of a New England college recommending the majority in the sev- 
eral States to use their power to enforce the teaching of certain specific views 
of New Testament history which he is pleased to declare all competent critics 
have accepted. 
“But,” say the advocates of the teaching to which we refer, ‘‘ we only wish to 
inculcate the real results of scientific research in regard to alcohol.” ‘To which 
we rejoin that, in a community like this, it is too soon to inculcate the truth, 
supposing you have it, if the issue is still jpractioaly: open, and if large numbers 
of your fellow-citizens are not persuaded that what you call the truth is the 
truth. Minorities have their rights even when they are in the wrong, and to 
use aschool system which the minority support to teach opinions which the lat- 
ter do not believe to be true is unfair. 
But there is another view of the matter. Are the advocates of such instruc- 
tion prepared to have it communicated in a thoroughly nonpartisan spirit? Are 
they prepared to have the whole truth taught, or do they want only that part of 
the truth which is favorable to the specific end they have in view? Are they 
prepared, for example, to give any fair representation to the views of those who 
consider that alcohol has its important uses, dietetic and social? A few years 
ago the Contemporary Review opened its columns to a discussion of the alcohol 
question ; and we are safe in saying that there was a preponderance of opinion 
among the many eminent men who joined in the discussion in favor of a moder- 
ate use of alcoholic beverages. In the August number of the North American 
Review, a well-known physician of this city enters a plea against the indiscrimi- 
nate condemnation of narcotics and stimulants. Is ali this opinion to go unrep- 
resented when the alcohol question is introduced into the schools? Of course 
it must, or the specific object of the teaching would be ruined. We say, there- 
fore, that this is not teaching science ; it is harnessing science to the ‘* temper- 
ance’ cart, and driving her under instruction from ‘‘ temperance ” headquarters. 
THE RESULT OF SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
[From Science, July 29, 1887.] 
Will the reader please cast his eye upon the following questions : 1. How can 
it be proved that nicotine is a poison? 2. Why are cigarettes especially harm- 
_ ful? 3. Is alcohol a food? 4, What is the effect of disuse upon a muscle? 
5. Under what names is opium sold? 6. Under what name is alcohol drunk ? 
7. What is the difference between a food and a poison? 8. Is anything gained 
by changing from one narcotic to another? 9. What is the effect of beer asa 
drink? 10, How does cheerfulness help the muscles? These are the questions 
given as a test_in physiology in the public schools of a prominent Eastern city. 
They are not addressed to young men about to leave school. No; they are asked 
of little boys and girls of from 8 to 10 years of age. This is the examination 
paper at the end of the first year’s elementary instruction in physiology. Of ten 
questions, eight relate to drinking and smoking; the physiology is a mere side 
issue. These children, who ought to have about as much knowledge of such 
matters as they should of the methods in vogue at the stock exchange, are  
-P-A-G-E-143
  
    
SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE. INSTRUCTION. 735° 
actually forced to learn by rote the details of human vice;-and that, too, under — 
the name of ‘‘ physiology,” the only science which they learn. Unconsciousness, 
naiveté, is the symbol of childhood. The fact that physiology, even if well 
taught, tends tq destroy this trait is the chief objection to its early study. In- 
struction such as the above-implies crushes the most valuable trait in the child, 
directs curiosity to what is morbid, and forces into precocious development all 
its dangerous elements. Not enough thatthe newspaper and the dime novel pro- 
claim in glaring colors the story of crime and sin ; some notion of the perversity of 
human nature must be mixed with the food of babes. “That the result of this 
teaching is to excite in the children a morbid curiosity to experiment for them- 
selves in such matters; or (with the boys) to regard the whole thing as a lesson 
in ‘‘ goody-goodiness,” to which they forthwith decide to show themselves supe- 
rior; or to regard their father who takes his glass of wine at dinner as an incipi- 
ent criminal—this could easily have been foreseen and goes without saying. 
If there is one method better than all others to produce a race of drunkards, 
this has good claims to that distinction. If there is a degree of wrong in such 
superlatively perverse methods, then it is still worse that the fair name of 
science should be outraged in this cause. Not only that this kind of teaching 
necessarily depends upon catechism methods (that the answer to the second 
question, for example, is to read that the especial perniciousness of cigarettes 
- is due to the fact that they are usually made of decayed cigar stumps), but that 
the entire idea of science thus implanted is as wrong as it well can be. Better 
far revert tothe old days when there was no science on the curriculum than 
have science thus taught. The crowning educational virtue of science is that 
it leads to the use of scientific methods of teaching ; this usurper chokes up all 
possibility of an interest in the scientific. The temperance question is doubt- 
less one of the most important with which our age has to deal; sufficiently 
important, perhaps, to make some consideration of it in the public schoolsa 
legitimate proceeding, but it must be done at the right time and in the proper 
way. Nothing can excuse the conversion of a text-book on physiology into a 
“temperance” tract; nothing can excuse the sacrilege of presenting this story 
of disgusting vice under the name of ‘‘ science.” 
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOLS. 
[From the Medical Record, September 24, 1887.] 
Probably no class of men in the community are better fitted to give a calm, 
unprejudiced opinion on the alcohol question than physicians. In their capacity _ 
of public sanitary guardians, they feel an interest in all practical measures de- 
signed to limit the deleterious effects of the use of liquors upon the human sys- 
tems. The latesteffortin this direction is the introduction into the public schools 
of several States of so-called ‘f temperance” text-books and other paraphernalia 
of teaching. Some communities have already experienced the first fruits of this 
new system of instruction. These results are somewhat curious. It is found 
that the incidental facts designed only to lead up to the one great moral are 
more prominent in the pupils’ minds than the moral itself. The various charts 
which portray stomachs, livers, and other viscera diseased from alcohol are re- 
garded much in the light of picture-books on a targe scale. They produce no 
more impression on a child’s mind than the sight of a tattooed man, or some 
“freak” of a dime museum. 
It isright that the question of temperance should be brought down to the scope 
of a child’s ideas; right from a medical standpoint as well as from a moral one. 
But it is hardly the judicious course to teach him to regard aleohol as a deadly 
poison under every circumstance. He will be disillusioned as he grows older, 
and will look back to his text-book teaching as a mass of overstated facts. The 
trouble with many of the text-books on temperance used in schools is that they 
are not physiologically correct. They are written by persons with more zeal 
than accurate knowledge, and consequently we have sometimes ludicrous state- 
ments from pupils. The description of the distillation of alcohol strikes the 
child as a very interesting thing, and so the fact designed to be taught—its per- 
nic ious effects—fails to make a lasting impression. é 
We think that a better state of things could be brought about if physicians 
could be led to take a more active management in the public schools. Ministers, 
lawyers, business men, and professional politicians are always represented upon 
school boards, but rarely physicians. They are the very ones who should be 
fully represented. They can, by their advice, better than any other class, con- 
duce to bring up a class of pupils who shall have sound minds in sound bodies. 
They can prevent the introduction of text-books on temperance or any other 
topic having a reference to physical matters which are not written with a due        
-P-A-G-E-144
736 - | EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
regard for truth and for the receptivity of the minds which are to graspit. It 
is coming more and more to be realized that a physician’s duty to the community 
-oyersteps the sphere of mere sanitary matters and lays hold upon social factors 
as well. Much of the teaching in schools nowadays is one-sided, because the 
mind is regarded as something apartfrom the body and taught accordingly. No 
one so well appreciates the relation of one to the other as the physician. 
HOW WE TEACH INTEMPERANCE, 
|From the Popular Educator, December, 1891.] 
At the Norfolk County teachers’ convention, recently held in Boston, a paper 
was read on the teaching of physiological temperance (or intemperance) in the 
public schools; and, a little more than a week after, the same subject was pre- 
sented for our consideration at a teachers’ meeting in Hyde Park. 
At the former meeting it was very noticeable in the discussion that followed 
the reading of the paper that those who objected to this scientific teaching, tak- 
ing the moral side instead, met with greater favor from the audience as a body, 
judging from the heartiness of the applause, than the paper itself. Possibly, if 
those gentlemen who advocated the strengthening of the moral nature as the 
best preventive of intemperance had explained their position more fully, this 
article would not have been written. 
There is, as I believe, a radical error at the basis of this scientific teaching of 
intemperance, or its causes, to little children. Let me illustrate. ~* 
On our way home from the convention we were discussing this subject, and 
- oneof our party related the following incident which had come under her notice: 
A teacher, who was an enthusiast on this subject, had taken the fruit into the 
schoolroom and taught the children the process by which the pure juices of the 
grape and apple were changed into alcohol, and its effect upon the body. 
A short time after, one of the boys who had been instructed by her remarked 
to some one that he had learned the taste of all the liquors in his father’s store 
(he was a saloon keeper), and could readily distinguish one from the other. . 
How much fear of the effects of alcohol upon his body do you suppose had been 
created in this boy’s mind by this teaching? Instead of this, it would seem 
there had been aroused in him a curiosity to know more of the things about 
which he had been taught. 
How many of these boys, think you, went home, took their grapes and apples, 
and made their own wine and cider ? ‘ 
All might not do this, of course, but, judging human nature as it appears, and 
f especially child nature, there seems to be a strong desire to do that which is 
forbidden. 
I know the thought has been, and still prevails, that to avoid evil we must 
know something about it. Z 
What is our practice in educational matters ? 
Formerly teachers used to put mistakes upon the blackboard to correct, but 
now the best teachers claim that children should see only the perfect form of 
word or letter. 
We teach children to be pure in thought, word, and deed, but would never 
think of specifying the evils to be avoided. 
No wise parent or teacher would ever say to a child, ‘‘ You must not read that 
book. It contains that which will poison your mind and give you wrong views 
of life.” . 
Nevertheless, I did hear of a teacher not long ago who advised her girls not 
to read a certain book which she named, and immediately they sought and ob- 
tained the book, of which they had not known before, and read it, although 
warned against it. 
No doubt all who read this can recall many instances of like character, 
Vice is a monster of such frightful mien, 
That to be hated, needs but to be seen; 
But seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace. 
As the world is to-day, the children can not but see that which we call evil all 
about them; but if they have been taught to love the good, the evil will be 
hated, or perhaps not recognized by them; while, if we continually keep it be- 
fore their minds, even though we teach them to avoid it, we make it a familiar 
object of thought which can not but produce bad results. 
“Ag a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” 
“Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever 
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, what- 
   
-P-A-G-E-145
SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 3T 
soever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any 
praise, think on these things.” 
We all know what great imitators children are, and that with them example 
goes further than precept. How, then, can we teach them the bad effects of 
alcohol and tobacco so they will feel it and never touch them when fathers and 
brothers and men who hold high places in the community and are respected by 
everyone are slaves to one or both of these habits? We must find some other 
means of teaching them the truth so they also shall not be led into this cap- 
tivity to the senses, than that recommended at the convention. 
Teach temperance, not intemperance; health, not disease; truth, not error; 
purity, not impurity; goodness, not badness; teach the positive, not the nega- 
tive. s 
A TEACHER. 
“EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL.” 
[From the Journal of Education (Boston), December 81, 1891.] 
May I again call attention of the importance of strictly adhering to truth in 
teaching concerning the effects of all drugs upon the body. On page 359 of the 
Journal we are told, ‘‘ Whatever effect is produced upon the albumen of the egg 
by contact with the alcohol the same thing must happen when alcohol is mixed 
with food in the stomach.” 
This is incorrect: 1. Because blood albumen is not egg albumen. 2. Because 
the blood albumen is greatly diluted, while the egg albumen is concentrated. 
3. Because in one case the alcohol used is concentrated, in the other greatly - 
diluted. 4. The experiment in the test tube is performed away from the “life 
forces,” while in the body ‘‘life forces” modify chemical forces. Ina word, a 
laboratory experiment must not be taken to explain literally what occurs in the 
body. The boy, taking a drink of beer, finds he is not killed by it, and soon 
comes to reject all that he has been taught in reference to the effects of stimu- 
lants. Harm is done by our inaccuracy.

CHILDREN CAN BE TAUGHT TO THINK ABOUT BETTER THINGS. 
An effort has recently been made to fight intemperance by teaching, in con- 
nection with the subject of physiology, the effects of alcohol and narcotics on 
the system. It is an open question whether the results are all that were antici- 
pated. It seems that in many places the craze after cigarettes and old cigar 
stumps is worse than ever before, notwithstanding the fact that the schoolsare 
giving instruction along thisline. Why is this? It is quite possible that many 
teachers use both time and text book in sucha way as to injure the cause of tem- 
perance. To spend a portion of each recitation in talking aboutrum and tobacco 
is, to say the least, unwise on the part of the teacher. Instead of this let him 
class rum, tobacco, and opium with other things that should be let alone, and 
let him speak of them only as occasion requires. The better way will be to see 
that none of these things are found on or about the schcol grounds. Milton has 
not increased our hatred of Satan by making hima heroin Paradise Lost. Why 
should rum and tobacco be the ‘‘ heroes” inso many school rooms? Children 
can be taught to think about better things. (J. D..Meese, Southwest State Nor- 
mal School, Pennsylvania.) 
VII. ANSWERS TO SOME FALSE NOTIONS. 
BY MRS. MARY H. HUNT. 
The following misconceptions have arisen in certain quarters concerning the 
teaching of physiological or scientific temperance :   First, that “temperance is a moral not a scientific question; therefore, if 
taught at all in the schoolsit should be from the moral standpoint only.” ‘The 
strengthening of the moral nature is the best preventive of intemperance.” 
“You should strengthen the will to prevent the pupil from drinking,” these 
objectors say. - 
Second, “If you teach the pupil the evil character and effects of alcohol, 
tobacco, etc., the law of perversity in his nature will make him want to try those 
things for himself,” etc. 
Third, ‘‘ As long as the fathers smoke and drink it is not only of no use to 
teach the children not to, but such teaching is disrespectful to parents.”

738 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
In answer to the first objection that ‘‘ temperance is a moral, not a scientific 
question,” etc., let us inquire : 
~(1) Is it not true that a moral question is one that considers what is right or 
wrong in action on the part of beings capable of choice? 
(2) Are there not certain facts which are the reasons for an action or course of 
action being right or wrong ? 
(3) If these facts, the reasons for the right. or wrong, are duly arranged in 
the case of each obligation, do they not form the science of that special obliga- 
tion? Webster says 3 that a Science is knowledge duly arranged.” 
(4) Can a person be taught the principles of morality in any case, or to intelli- 
gently choose the right “without being taught the facts which show why one 
course or set of acts is right and another wrong; are not these facts the science 
of the case ? 
To illustrate: Moral obligations may be classified under three general heads: 
(1) Duties to our Maker. 
(2) Duties to our fellowmen. 
(3) Duties to ourselves. 
The facts that are the reasons for our duties to our Creator are set forth in 
the science of theology. 
Those in the ease of our duties to our fellowmen are classed as the science of 
sociclogy. 
The facts that prove our moral obligations to ourselves in the case of alcoholic 
drinks and other narcotics are very properly termed the science of temperance ; 
and here, as in the case of other duties, no person can fully comprehend the 
extent or scope of that obligation without knowing the facts. 
The answer to the question, ‘‘What is the nature and effects of these sub- 
stances,” is the facts in this case, on which the whole temperance question 
rests. 
- There is no such thing as moral question without a basis of fact that is the 
science of the question. These are not the days of dogmatic morality. Modern 
morality teaches the reasons for the right, shows why, and thus ‘strengthens 
the moral nature.” 
The objector says, ‘Strengthen the will to resist temptation.” How do we 
strengthen the will? The will is the faculty in us that acts on choive, and our 
choices are more or less influenced by our knowledge or ignorance of the facts 
in the case. How would you strengthen the will of a boy against the tempta- 
tion to row across the Ningara River alittle way above the falls—by telling him 
_ he must not, it would be wrong, or by explaining to his reason the perils that 
inhere in that fatal current? How would I strengthen a boy’s will against 
intemperance? I would try to give him intelligent reasons on which his will 
should act. Just as I would teach him the character of the Niagara Rapids I 
would teach him the nature of those other, the alcoholic rapids, that lead toa 
worse, a more hopeless plunge into utter darkness. WhileI would never exag- 
gerate, I would search for the truth on this topic as for “hid treasures,” and 
then, teach it, abating not ‘‘ one jotor tittle,” leaving the consequences with Him 
who said ‘“‘T am the Truth.” He has so made the human mind that it is moved 
by truth that warns as well as promises. I would teach the boy before appetite 
is formed the dangerous and deceptive character of alcoholic drinks and other 
nareotics, especially that proven fact that a little alcohol in any liquor has the 
power to create an imperious, uncontrollable, and destructive appetite for more, 
and therefore its use in any quantity is never safe, I-would show him that 
there is a scientific connection between the first glassand the drunkards’ fate, I 
would not preach atthe boy nor weary him with repeated homily, but I would 
lead him, through the study of the laws of his own being, to see and understand 
for himself that the inestimable blessing and happiness of a strong, healthy, 
useful life are the result of obedience to laws that are written in our living tis- 
sues, and that the penalty of disobedience inheres in the law itself. I would 
strip the wine cup, and the whole brood of strong drinks, the pipe, the cigar, 
and the cigarette of the glamor with which ignorance and tradition have decked 
them, and help the boy to see them and their consequences as labeled by modern 
science—narcotic poisons. 
In answer to the second objection, that teaching the evil character of alcoholic 
drinks will make the pupil want to try them for himself, we reply: If we tell the 
boy the perils of the rapids in the smooth, safe- -looking stream above the falls, 
will he immediately wish to embark thereon? Is ita rule that teaching the con- 
sequences of evil is only furnishing a motive for immediately plunging into the 
evil? Ifso, there must be something radically wrong in the most authoritative 
of all teaching, for all through the Bible the blessings of right doing are coupled 
   
-P-A-G-E-147

SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
with vivid descriptions of the consequences of following the wrong. Gerizim 
and Ebal stand together. Iam sure the great body of teachers in our land will 
agree that it will be safe for us tofollow in method the great Teacher. He made 
the human mind, and He knows the laws of its development far better than we 
ever can, after all our study. 2 
We teach the need of pure airand good ventilation by showing its importance 
and relation to health, and how to get it, and the consequences of its absence. - 
If you teach the need of oxygen by showing the consequences of breathing vitiated 
air, are you thereby teaching imperfect ventilation? Such aclaim would be absurd. 
And yet a recent writer refers to teaching the evil nature and effects of alcoholice 
drinks, etc., as ‘‘teaching intemperance.” Then the vivid descriptions of in- 
temp2rance in the ‘‘ woes” the Bible pronounces upon drunkards is ‘‘ teaching 
intemperance.” These objectors certainly need a new and expunged version of 
the greatest of all manuals of instruction. ae 
Experience must, after all, decide, and happily we are not without precedent. - 
Wherever in the thirty-five States of our country the spirit and letter of the law 
requiring this study are obeyed, and well-graded text-books on this topic con- 
taining the truths the law requires taught are used, with the same wise and 
thorough methods of teaching asin the case of other branches, pupils thus taught 
have not consequently rushed headlong to the saloons. On the contrary, an in- 
telligent aversion to strong drinks and other narcotics is manifest ; fewer cigar- 
ettes are smoked, and pupilsare more careful to obey other laws of hygiene. 
Giving an occasional temperance exhortation in the schoolroom may take 
less time and, study on the partof the teacher, but, compared With the results of 
carefully prepared lessons that guide the pupil in finding and intelligently un- 
derstanding the reasons for total abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and other 
narcotics, and for obedience to other lawsof health, the mere exhortation or so- 
called moral homily falls immeasurably short. 
The prophet said, ‘‘ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,” not for = 
lack of exhortation. To aright-minded child or youth the most impressive of ~ 
all moral lessons is the one that convinces his understanding and is thereby 
lodged in his reason. Thatall children and youth are notright-minded towards 
aleohol and tobacco is evidence of the deep wound these substances have made 
upon our humanity through inheritance upon children and ‘children’s chil- 
dren.” That someof these, heavily weighted with the sins of the fathers,will go 
wrong anyway, does not prove that faithful instruction is useless in all other 
cases. = 
To the third objection we would put the question: Shall we make no attempt 
to teach the children better because the fathers drink and smoke? Because 
some parents murder the Queen’s English, we do not therefore think it useless 
or disrespectful to their parents to teach the children correct speech, and as a 
consequence the generations rise in the scale of better utterance. ‘ 
The difficulties are appreciated of teachers who were commanded to teach this 
topic and given nothing to do it with but the imperfect, badly graded books first 
put upon the market. But a better day has dawned. Well-graded manuals of 
instruction, that contain these truths adapted to all classes, are published in great 
abundance and variety. i 
‘Truth is the lever of Archimedes that moves the world. The truth concern- 
ing the evil nature of alcoholic drinks and other narcotics is the lever destined 
to overthrow their use. To the teacher has come the opportunity to scatter 
that truth. Opportunity is God’s command.

FOR PRIMARY GRADES. ‘ 
In this subject, as in other branches which extend through several years of 
school life, a few of the simple elements of each topic are taught, where the sub-

sons on the harm that comes from the use.of tobacco and the common alcoholic 
drinks. 
Second year pupils review these topics with additional matter and add lessons 
on care of the bones, the hygiene of eating and drinking, breathing, etc. “The 
special points brought out in these lessons will be written out by the children 
at the close of the lesson, and from these written exercises selections may be 
made and sent on to the exhibit with photographs of class, ete., as above. 
Third year pupils, reviewing the ground already covered, learn more on each 
topic, and add a few simple facts about muscles, nerves, the organs of digestion, 
circulation, respiration, etc.; the best of their written exercises may also be 
selected. 
In response to request, the questions given below are suggested by the depart- 
ment of scientific temperance instruction. 3 
QUESTIONS ON THE SENSES FOR FOURTH YEAR PUPILS. 
(Notz.—Other topics studied during the fourth year are, food, alcoholic drinks and other 
narcotics, digestion, circulation, respiration, the skin, bones, muscles, and nervous system, the 
hygiene of each being chiefly developed. As it is manifestly impossible in the time allowed for 
preparing papers for this exhibit to cover all the topics studied in any one grade, a selection 
as*been made of one or more for each grade, with questions covering salient points.]

QUESTIONS ON THE’ ORIGIN AND NATURE OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, FOR FIFTH 
YEAR PUPILS. 
[Nore.—According to the plan of grading this study, now in most successful operation, only 
a part of the topics included in the whole subject, as food, alcoholic drinks, digestion, cireula- 
tion, and respiration, are taken up during the fifth year; the remainder, bones, muscles, skin, 
nervous system, and senses, being left for the sixth year. But the work, though more exhaust- 
ive than that in the fourth year, still leaves much that the poey is not yet prepared to compre- 
hend. The same plan is again pursued for the seventh and eighth years, the seventh year tak- 
ing up the same topics as the fifth, é. ¢., food, alcoholic drinks, digestion, circulation, respira- 
tion, but with a more thorough and comprehensive treatment; the eighth taking the same 
topics as the sixth-year grades, é. e., bones, muscles, skin, nervous system, and senses, with more comprehensive treatment. The topics covered by the questions are selected in accord- 
ance With this plan.]

Ris GENERAL STATEMENT. 
The higher education of women continues to receive marked attention in this ~ 
country, several institutions for this purpose having been established during 
the past few years. These institutions make provision for instruction of colle- 
giate grade and are not merely ‘‘finishing” schools. The tendency seems to be 
to establish these institutions as colleges affiliated to universities already estab- 
lished, or at least to locate them in cities where leading universities exist, thus. 
securing to these new schools the advantages of large and well-selected libraries, 
museums, etc., facilities which otherwise could not be obtained until after along 
period of years.. Another advantage gained by locating them in university 
towns consists in this, that very frequently the services of some of the university _ 
professors or instructors whose time is not fully occupied with their regular 
duties can be easily secured for a part of the day. In this manner nearly all the 
instruction in a few of the more prominent of these institutions is provided by 
university professors, and this fact has done much toward making their work 
successful. A short account of the establishment of some of the institutions re- 
cently founded is here given. 4 
DESCRIPTION OF NEW INSTITUTIONS. 
Barnard College.—Since the year 1885 Columbia College, New York, has 
granted the degree of bachelor of arts to women who have pursued a course of 
study equivalent to that for which the degree is conferred in the school of arts. 
Notwithstanding the degree was conferred by the college no provision was — 
yaade by which the women pursuing this course could obtain instruction from the 
faculty, although those who had secured this degree might study for higher — 
degrees under the direction of the professors of the college. -The suggestion 
was therefore made to found a college where women studying for the Columbia — 
degrees could receive instruction from the college faculty. This proposal re- 
ceived the official approval of the trustees of Columbia in March, 1889, and the 
college was opened for instruction in the following October. The name given 
to the new institution is Barnard College, in honor of the late Dr. F. A. P. Bar- 
nard, who had always taken great interest in the higher education of women 
and had advocated granting to women full opportunity for collegiate training. 
- The course of study is identical with that of the School of Arts of Columbia Col- 
lege, and is intended to give to the girls of New York and its vicinity the same 
instruction that is given to the boys. In order that the statusof this institution 
may be made clear the following is reprinted from the first report of the aca- 
demic committee: 
“The entrance examination papers are the same for the students of Barnard 
and Columbia, the papers are passed upon by the same examining board, the 
course of study is the same, and at the end of the course the degree awarded is: 
. thesame. These facts are emphasized because nothing is so constantly mis- 
FAS

    Re 
  744. “EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. ae 
understood as the fact that Barnard College has no separate academic existence. 
Educationally considered, Barnard is Columbia. ie only autonomy is admin- 
istrative and financial.” 
The establishment of Barnard College rendered indeteeary the continuance 
of the collegiate course for women by Columbia, and no new students in that 
course are received $ but those who haye already been admitted to the course 
wiil be allowed to complete it. 
Barnard College does not yet possess an endowment fund, but depends for its 
support upon the fees from its students and upon yearly contributions. Stren- 
uous efforts are being made to raise an endowment sufficient to make the insti- 
_ tution in a measure independent of students’ fees. 
Although Barnard has no productive funds,'on account of its relations with 
Columbia College it has been able to exact that its students should be fully 
prepared to enter upon the course as laid down. It has been decided by the au- 
thorities, as a result of the experience of the first year, to accept, at least for 
- some years to come, only regular students in its undergraduate classes. This 
was rendered necessary by the large number of students who wished to enter 
upon special courses. Students who wish to pursue special courses in botany 
and chemistry only will be admitted, but such students must pass the examina- 
tions required for admission to the freshman class. The first year’s work of the 
college proved successful. There were thirty-six students in attendance, which 
number was increased to forty-five at the beginning of the second year; of 
these, eighteen are in the regular classes, eight are graduate students, and six- 
teen are specials in chemistry and botany only, while three are specials from 
last year who are permitted to remain. 
Woman’s College of Balttmore.—Another addition to the institutions for the 
higher education of women is the Woman’s College of Baltimore, Maryland. 
This institution was first opened for instruction in September, 1888, with fifty 
students, while the number in attendance during the year 1889-90 was two hun- 
dred and eighty-three. Of this number only thirty were in attendance upon reg- 
ular undergraduate courses, one hundred and thirty-three were in special or 
partial courses, while the remainder were in the preparatory department. The 
name of this department has been changed to Girls’ Latin School of Baltimore 
‘and the purpose is to give it a separate organization. 
The institution was founded ‘‘to provide women with the best facilities for 
securing liberal culture. Its primary purpose is to meet the educational de- 
mands arising in the Methodist Episcopal Church. Itwas established by action 
of that church, and is conducted under its fostering care. At the same time it 
was nop planned and is not managed in an exclusive or sectarian spirit.’ 
The buildings, three in number, have been erected since 1887 and are valued 
at $340,000, while the productive funds of the college amount to $150,000. The 
president of the institution is Rev. John F. Goucher, D. D. 
The scheme of instruction consists of four years’ courses of study leading to the 
degree of bachelor of arts, supplemented by such instruction in subcollegiate 
courses as may be found necessary. No election of studies is allowed in the first 
collegiate year and but little in the second. In the third and fourth years a 
wide range ee choice is permitted, to accord with individual tastes or tomeet the 
. demands of preparation for practical work. 
Cleveland ole lege for Women.—The Cleveland College for Women, Cleveland, 
Ohio, was first opened for instruction in 1888 as a department of Western Re- 
serve University. At the same time the trustees of the university decided to 
receive no more women into Adelbert College. That the success of the new 
school might be assured, the faculty of Adelbert College generously offered their 
services for a term of years as instructors. During the first year twenty-three 
young women were admitted, but two of whom were in the regular courses. 
During 1889-90 the number of students increased to thirty-eight, eleven of whom 
were in the regular courses, of which there are three, viz, the classical and mod- 
ern language courses, leading to the degree of A. B. and the Latin English course 
to that of PH. B. The institution received $100,000 from Mrs. Eliza A, Clark, 
one-half of which is to be used for the erection of a building and the remainder 
invested as an endowment fund. : 
Livelyn College.—In 1887 Evelyn College, an institution for women, was opened 
at Princeton, N. J. Its location at this place gives the institution very great 
advantages, inasmuch as the use of the libraries and museums of the College of 
  
ie the settlement of the Fayerweather estate, New York, Barnard will receive a fund of

New Jersey, popularly known as Princeton College, are granted to the students. 
The college offers the following courses of study : 
I. A classical and scientific course corresponding to thatof Princeton College, 
including the lectures of the professors and examinations upon them. 
II. Post-graduate courses under the direction of the professors of Princeton — 
College. 
TI. A special or elective course with lectures and college advantages, in which 
French and German may be substituted for Latin and Greek, and other modifi- 
cations made to meet the requirements of those who, for want of time or for 
other reasons, are prevented from taking the full college course. 
IV. Preparatory classes, with reference to either collegiate or special work. 
V. Opportunities for the study of music, art, and modern languages, including 
constant conversation in French and German. 
Evelyn College grants its own degrees, and in this respect it differs from Bar- 
nard College, whose students receive the Columbia degree. Another point of 
difference between these two institutions is that while Evelyn gives instruction 
in preparatory studies, Barnard receives only those as students who are already 
prepared to enter the freshman class. Thus of the forty-six students in attend- 
ance at Evelyn during the year 1889-90, only four are reported as in the regular 
undergraduate courses. * ~ 
PREPARATORY DEPARTMENTS, ETC. 
It can not but be deplored that so many of the higher institutions of learning 
in this country are compelled, either through the lack of good preparatory _ 
schools or on account of insufficient endowment funds, to maintain preparatory 
and other departments which are neither collegiate, professional, nor post- 
graduate, The maintenance of such departments calls for a part of the valuable 
time of a number of professors which otherwise could be devoted entirely to the 
collegiate classes or be spent in the necessary study and research so indispensa- 
ble to the college professor of the present time. But the large number of in- 
stitutions claiming to give higher instruction, especially those for women, 
renders it necessary for the larger part of them to maintain all grades of in- 
struction, so that a large number of students may be enrolled, the tuition fees 
of whom are necessary to meet the expenses of the institutions. Some idea of 
the amount of labor that is imposed on some of the professors of colleges may be 
formed from the fact that in one of the colleges for women five professors give 
all the instruction to sixty students in the preparatory department, twenty 
students in the seminary or academic department, and fifty students in the col- 
legiate department, to say nothing of the instruction in music and art, which of 
course is furnished by these professors. 
A majority of the colleges for women are without endowment and are therefore 
compelled to rely in great part if not entirely upon the fees received from the 
students. This is especially the case with the large number of such institutions 
in the South, where more than 68 per cent of all the institutions for the higher 
education of women exclusively are situated. 
The list of colleges for women contains a large number of institutions which 
should really be classed assecondary schools, but which, by virtue of the authority 
to confer degrees granted them by the several State legislatures, demand to be, 
included in the table devoted to colleges for women. ‘This fact necessitates the. 
incorporation in this table of institutions not authorized to confer degrees, but 
which maintain courses of study that are by far superior to the courses for which 
regular collegiate degrees are conferred by alarge number of the institutions, 
In order to show how easy it is to obtain a degree in one of these the following 
course of study for which the degree of A. B. isconferred is taken from its catalogue:

___A comparison of this course with the admission requirements of institutions 
- like Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, etc., shows that the above course for the first three 
years is little more than what is required for admission to the freshman classes 
of institutions like those above named. Again, it will be seen that Greek has 
-no place whatsoever in the curriculum. The above course is a fair sample of 
the courses of study offered by a number of colleges for women and shows that 
_ there is room for considerable improvement in this class of institutions. 
This state of affairs is due. without doubt, to the lack of endowment funds. 
In connection with this subject W. Le Conte Stevens says: ‘‘ Experience has 
~ amply demonstrated that no institution of learning can preserve a high standard 
of scholarship and present an extensive course of studies for selection unless pos- 
sessed of a permanent endowment, so as to be wholly or partly independent of 
the fluctuations of patronage. Without-this it is like an engine without a fly- 
wheel.” A glance at column 17 of the table of colleges for women will show that 
this important feature of institutions for higher education is rendered prominent 
by its infrequent appearance in the tabulation of the statistics. The table on 
the following page shows that the total amount of endowment funds reported by 
the 179 institutions is $2,609,661, of which amount $1,901,461, or 72.8 per cent, is 
reported by 12 institutions of the North Atlantic Division. ’ 
In a large number of cases the institutions are either owned by the president 
_ or leased to him by the owners, and he makes out of it whatever he can. In this 
respect these institutions differ very materially from the coeducational and male 
institutions, where the president is generally engaged by aboard of trustees, by 
i aon his work and actions are controlled and from whom he receives a stated 
_ salary.

    148 ~ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The total number of colleges and seminaries for women reporting to the Bu- 
reau during 1889-90 was 179, which is 19 less than were included under the same 
category in 1888-89. A number of institutions hithertore ported as colleges or 
seminaries for women have been classed this year as secondary schools. This 
action was warranted either by some statement of the reporting officers or by 
the work of the institutions as shown by an examination:of the catalogues. 
Owing to the widely diversified characteristics of these institutions it is a very. 
difficult matter to devise some standard of classification which, if adopted, would 
give due credit to all the institutions for the work which is done by them. A 
few of the better class give instruction which will compare favorably with that 
afforded by some of the best male and coeducational institutions. But the large 
majority of the institutions do not come up to this standard. They begin by 
admitting pupils to the primary and preparatory departments, usually organized 
on the plan of a graded school, and conduct the pupils by successive stages, 
. through the academic and collegiate departments. The course in the last-named. 
depar ‘tment would not in a large number of cases take a student farther than 
the end of the sophomore year in a college for males. 
An examination of a number of the catalogues also shows that with some ex- 
ceptions Greek is entirely omitted from the curriculum. We also find that some 
institutions will give the degree of A. B. for a course which is considerably in- 
ferior to courses which in other institutions are not accorded adegree. It will 
therefore be seen-that a classification based only on the authority to confer de- 
_ grees would not be a just classification in this case. Until a suitable standard 
shall be decided upon, the classification adopted a few years ago will be con- 
tinued. 
A glance at Division A of the table' of colleges for women will show that the 
number of institutions in this division has been increased from 8 in 1888-89 to 14 
in the current year. This increase resulted from the establishment of afew new 
institutions and the reorganization of several others, through which reorgani- 
zation they were raised to the regular college grade. In afewcases the number 
of students in the collegiate departments is very small, but such is nearly always 
the case in newly established institutions or in newly organized departments of 
institutions. 
Endowment.—The institutions in Division A are as a rule fairly well endowed, 
differing somewhat in this respect front the institutions included in Division B: 
The total amount of permanent productive funds reported by the institutions 
in both divisions of the table was $2,609,661, of which amount $1,970,461, or 75.5 
per cent, was reported by 10 of the institutions in Division A, while the re- 
mainder was reported by 24 of the institutions in Division B, thus leaving 145 
institutions not reporting any productive funds, 
Scientisic apparatus.—The total value of scientific apparatus reported was $418,- 
900, of which $305,391, or 72.9 per cent, was reported by 12 of the institutions in 
Division A, while the remainder was reported in small amounts by 97 of the in- 
stitutions in Division B. This latter fact would seem to show that very little 
attention is paid by the institutions in this division to the practical study of 
chemistry, physics, astronomy, etc., for the prosecution of which apparatus is 
- absolutely necessary. 
Benefactions.—One evidence of the greater popularity of the institutions in 
Division A is shown in the column of the table devoted to benefactions. The 
total amount of gifts and bequests to the 179 institutions during 1889-90 was 
$303,257, and of this amount $193,502, or 63.8 per cent, was reported by 9 of the 
14 institutions in this division, while the remaining $109,775 was reported by 29 
of the institutions in Division B. The latter amount was reported in sums vary- 
ing from $15 to $20,000, while the former was comprised of sums ranging from 
$465, reported by Bryn n Mawr College, to $61,000, reporte a by the Woman’s Col- 
lege of Baltimore. 
income.—The attempt to tabulate and publish the income of these institutions 
has been abandoned for the present. It was found that the reports on this sub- 
ject were so meagre that the totals would not be valuable for any purpose what- 
soever. As said before, a large number of these institutions are owned or leased. 
by the presidents, who manage and condvct them for the profits that can be 
made. Insuch cases the questions relating to finances of the institutions re- 
mained,as arule, unanswered, and when they were answered, the replies to the 
inquiry ‘asking for the amount received from tuition fees usually included the 
amount received for boar: d, lodging,ete. As it was desired to learn the amount

expended purely for educational purposes, it is evident that such answers could 
not be used and were practically useless. 
Degrees.— The following table presents thesummary, by States, of the number

Course of study.—In the report of the Bureau for 1888-89 appears a table giv- 
ing the courses of study in one hundred colleges and universities, including a 
few of the colleges for women of Division A. A similar scheme, somewhat con- 
densed, has been devised for the comparative representation of courses leading 
to the degree of A. B., as given in fifteen of the institutions included in Divi- 
sion B. All the studies have been grouped under five headings, viz, language, 
mathematics, natural science, history and geography, and philosophy and civil 
government. An examination of the table will show that while a few of the in- _ 
stitutions have a fairly good course for the degree of A. B., in other cases the 
same degree is earned quite easily. The course, as set forth in the latest cata- 
logues of the several institutions, is as follows:

I.—BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 
Number of institutions The number of colleges and universities from which 
this Office has received reports for the year under consideration is 415. The 
number is constantly increasing; a condition not to be regretted, provided the 
institutions do work for which they are prepared and equipped and not at- 
tempt to give courses of study for the successful prosecution of which they lack 
both the necessary appliances and finances. As is well known higher education 
is not and can not be celf-supporting and needs considerable aid from outside 
sources, either in the form of endowment funds or annual gifts or appropriations 
for currentexpenses. Notwithstanding this fact it often happens that no sooner 
is an institution established whose real work ought to be secondary instruction 
than it organizes a college of commerce, so-called normal, collegiate and gradu- 
ate departments, and calls itself a university, even if it has no endowment and 
relies almost entirely for support upon the tuition fees received from the stu- 
dents. 
It is frequently the case that some of the smaller institutions of the country 
advertise graduate or university courses of study,when, infact, they often have 
not a sufficient number of professors and instructors to carry on properly the 
undergraduate work of the institution. In order to make asuccess of graduate 
work—work which renders necessary considerable independent research—it is 
desirable, ifnot absolutely necessary, for the student to have, athis or her com- 
mand, large and well-equipped laboratories and libraries such as are far beyond 
the means of our smaller institutions. Such work ought, therefore, to be left to _ 
those institutions that are well endowed enough to provide the appliances which 
are indispensable for the successful prosecution of the work. The discussions 
of the relations of institutions to scholastic work and requirements have been 
intensified and extended by the action of the Harvard faculty in its attempt to 
shorten the time necessary for the acquisition of the A. B. degree.1 
Increase in number of institutions—The age of the institutions for higher edu- 
cation in the United States is inconsiderable when compared with that of 
European institutions. The first of our colleges, Harvard, was founded in 1638 
under circumstances which are familiar. From that time on new institutions 
were gradually established until now the number exceeds four hundred. This 
large increase in the number of institutions is due to the munificence of wealthy 
people who wish to promote the advancement of knowledge, to religious zeal, 
and to the formation and settlement of new States. The large majority of the

  756 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
people settling the new States are people of moderate means, who wish to give 
their children a good education, but who are frequently not able to spend the sum 
_« necessary to send them to an institution at a considerable distance from their 
7 homes. The desire for an institution of their own naturally follows, and the 
: attempt to establish one succeedsin the larger number of cases. In most of these 
attempts the object is accomplished through the aid of some one of the religious 
denominations by whom the controlling power is retained. The rivalry exist- 
~ ing among the several churches frequently causes the establishment of weak 
colleges in places where more good would be efiected by devoting the money 
thus used to the enlargement and better equipment of some existing institution. 
General character of colleges and universities.—Speaking of the general character 
of the universities and colleges of the United States the Hon. James Bryce, M. 
P.,in The American Commonwealth, says: ‘‘Out of this enormous total of de- 
gree-granting bodies very few answer to the modern conception of a university. 
If-we define a university as a place where teaching of a high order, teaching 
which puts a man abreast of the fullest and most exact knowledge of the time, 
is given in a range of subjects covering all the great departments of intellectual 
life,not more than twelve and possibly only eight or nine of the American in- 
stitutions would fall within the definition. Of these nearly all are to be found 
in the Atlantic States. Next below them come some thirty or forty foundations 
which are scarcely entitled to the name of universities, some because their range 
of instruction is still limited to the traditional literary and scientific course, such 
as it stood thirty years ago; others because, while professing to teach a great 
variety of subjects, they teach them in an imperfect way, having neither a suffi- 
ciently large staff of highly trained professors, nor an adequate provision of lab- 
oratories, libraries, and other external appliances. The older New England 
colleges are good types of the former group. Their instruction is sound and 
thorough as far as it goes, well calculated to fit a man for the profession of law 
or divinity; but it omits many branches of learning and science which have 
grown to importance within the last fifty years. There are also some Western 
colleges which deserve to be placed in the same category. Most of the West- 
_ ern State universities belong to the other group of this second class, that of in- 
stitutions which aim at covering more ground than they are as yet able to cover. 
They have an ambitious programme, but neither the state of preparation of their 
- students nor the strength of the teaching staff enables them to do justice to the 
promise which the programme holds out. They are true universities rather in 
aspiration than in fact. 
*‘Below these, again, there is a third and much larger class of colleges, let us 
say three hundred,’ which are for most intents and purposes schools. They 
differ from the yymnasia of Germany, the lycées of France, the grammar schools 
of England and high schools of Scotland, not only in the fact that they give de- 
grees to those who have satisfactorily passed through their prescribed course 
or courses, but in permitting greater personal freedom to the students than boys 
- would be allowed in those countries. They are universities or colleges as re- 
spects some of their arrangements, but schools in respect of the educational 
results attained. These three hundred may be further divided into two sub- 
classes, distinguished from one another partly by their revenues, partly by the 
character of the population they serve, partly by the personal gifts of the presi- 
dent, as the head of the establishment is usually called, and of the teachers. 
Some seventy or eighty, though comparatively small, are strong by the zeal and 
capacity of their teachers, and while not attempting to teach everything, teach 
the subjects which they do undertake with increasing thoroughness. The re- 
mainder would do better to renounce the privilege of granting degrees, and be 
-eontent to do school work according to school methods.” 
e System and methods of instruction.—A bout thirty or thirty-five years ago nearly 
all the colleges and universities of the country prescribed a regular four years’ 
course of study. The course consisted of classics and mathematics followed by 
the elements of mental and moral philosophy, and at its completion the degree 
of A. B. was conferred upon the students. The system of a prescribed inflexi- 
ple course has been abolished by the greater part of all the institutions. and con- 
siderable latitude in the matter of choice of studies isallowed. The adoption of 
the elective system, as itis called, was due to the demand for instruction in scien- 
tific studies, in addition to those of the old time curriculum. 
Provision for a choice of studies has been made in two different ways, viz, by 
offering to students the choice of separate and distinct courses of study, and by 
  
  iThe figures here used were taken from the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1885-86, when the total number of colleges and universities was 345.

offering electives in a course ofstudy. This latter plan was in vogue to a limited 
extent in Harvard University as early as 1843-44. The following extract from 
the catalogue for that year will show the arrangement at that time: ‘‘ The laws 
of the University allow, after the freshman year, to the parents or guardians of 
undergraduates a selection in respéct of certain specified studies, This selection 
must be made known to the faculty on or before the first day of June, in each 
year. If no notice of such selection be received, in respect of any student, the 
faculty themselves proceed to assign to such student the elective studies they 
deem it best for him to pursue. No student is allowed to select or have assigned 
to him more elective studies than will occupy, with the required studies in reci- 
tation and lectures, every week twenty-one hours.” At the date specified all 
the work of the freshman year and a comparatively large part of the work of 
the sophomore, junior, and senior years remained as required studies. The 
amount of ‘‘required” work has been gradually reduced, and the ‘‘elective” in- 
creased, until at the present time the only required studies in Harvard are in 
the freshman year: Rhetoric and composition (three times a week), chemistry” 
(lectures, Thursday, first half year), and German or French for those who do 
not present both of these languages for admission (three times a week); in the 
sophomore and junior years the prescribed work consists of themes and forensics; 
in the senior year no studies are prescribed. ~ 
The action of Harvard in offering electives to students was naturally followed 
by other institutions. These either offered similar privileges or formed new 
courses of study from which the student could take his choice. It may be well 
to note the fact that down to the present time none of the institutions allow as 
much freedom in this respect as Harvard. In many instances election is not 
allowed until the beginning of the junior year, while in some cases, especiall. 
in those institutions that are not well endowed, the prescribed courses are still 
adhered to. This action is very often a matter not of choice but of necessity, for 
an elective system can be maintained only by institutions where the teaching 
staff is able to do justice to a wide range of subjects. 
Union College, Nv. Y., and scientific education.— Union College, Schenectady, N. 
Y., claims to have been the first college to provide a scientific course of study. 
The essential features of this system, as originated by Dr. Nott and now so gen- 
erally adopted, was the substitution of the modern languages and an increased 
amount of mathematical and physical science in place of the Greek and Roman 
classics. A scientific course of study was offered by Union in 1833. This course, 
in 1838-39, was as follows: 
  FRESHMAN CLASS. 
First term : 
Sallust. 
Horace and Latin prosody. 
Herodotus and Thucydides. 
Second term : . 
‘Xenophon’s Cyropa and Anabasis. 
Horace, Roman Antiquities. Cicero de Officiis, de Amicit., etc. 
Third term : 
Livy, with composition and declamation. 
Algebra (Bourdon). 
Lysias, Isocrates, and Demosthenes, 
SOPHOMORE CLASS. 
First term : 
History. Arithmetic (Hassler). 
Algebra (Bourdon). 
Second term : 
History (Tytler). 
Natural theology (Paley). 
Plane geometry (Legendre). 
Third term: 
Natural history (Ware). + 
Solid geometry (Legendre). 
Logic (Whately). 
The studies of the freshman year, as given above, are the same as were pur- | 
sued at that time by students in the classical course. JUNIOR CLASS. 
First term : 
‘Trigonometry and applications (Hassler). Algebra (Bourdon). 
Rhetoric (Blair). Second term: 
Chemistry. Descriptive geometry (Davies), analytic 
geometry of two dimensions (Bouchar- lat). 
Natural philosophy (Farrar’s Mech.). 
‘Third term : 
Differential and integral calculus (Bou- 
charlat). 
Analytic geometry of three dimensions 
(Boucharlat). Natural philosophy (Farrar’s Mech.). 
SENIOR CLASS. First term : 
Mechanics (Boucharlat). 
Electricity and magnetism, optics (Biot). 
Elements of criticism. 
Second term: 
Astronomy. Moral philosophy. 
Chemistry (Kames, and lectures). 
Third term : 
Law-(Kent or Blackstone). 
Anatomy and physiology. 
Chemistry, botany, mineralogy, tech- 
nology, synoptical view of the sciences. 
It will be seen that in the 
above course of study neither ancient nor modern languages were pursued after 
the freshman year. 
  This was changed shortly afterwards, for, in the catalogue 
                
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
  for 1842 we find that Latin (Tacitus and Juvenal) was studied in the first and sec- 
ond terms of the sophomore class and German during the second term of the 
junior class. French was first offered as an extra study in 1843, and was made a 
_ required study during the second term of the junior class in 1850. 
From 1838 to 1853 the requirements for admission and the studies of the fresh- 
man year of the classical course were identical with those of the scientific course, 
- and election between the two courses was made at the beginning of the sopho- 
more year. In 1854 the scientific course was remodeled, with the result that 
ancient languages disappeared entirely from it. The requirements for admis- 
sion, which were necessarily modified, demanded that the candidate ‘‘be thor- 
oughly prepared in English grammar and the other usual elementary studies, 
and be quite familiar with practical arithmetic. . 
From what has here been said, it will be seen that a student can at the pres- 
ent time purgue almost any studies above what is generally required for admis- 
sion to college during a period of four years, and at the completion thereof re- 
ceive his degree. Through the adoption of the elective system it naturally 
_ follows that a degree given by one college does not necessarily mean the same 
thing as the same degree given by another college. In fact, some institutions 
frequently confer the same degree upon students who pursued widely different 
courses of study. Harvard, for instance, offers for 1890-91 2193 full courses of 
instruction, of which 18.2 courses must and 25.2 courses may be taken to obtain 
the A. B. degree. From this total number of courses it will be seen that a large 
number of combinations, each leading to the A.B. degree, could be made. 
Degrees.—The fact that no fixed value is attached to the degrees in this coun- 
try causes considerable confusion, especially among foreigners, Respecting the 
significance of the degrees given in this country, Professor Bryce, in the American 
' Commonwealth, says: ‘‘As regards the worth of the degrees given, there is, of 
course, the greatest possible difference between those of the better and those of 
the lower institutions; nor is this difference merely one between the few great 
universities and the mass of small colleges or Western State universities, for 
among the smaller colleges there are some which maintain as high a standard 
of thoroughness as the greatest. The degrees of the two hundred colleges to 
-which I have referred? as belonging to the lower group of the third class have 
no assignable value, except that of indicating that a youth has been made to 
work during four years at subjects above the elementary. Those of instituticns 
belonging to the higher group and the two other classes represent, on an ayer- 
age, as much knowledge and mental discipline as the poll or pass degrees of 
_Cambridge or Oxford—possibly rather less than the pass degrees of the Scottish 
universities. Between the highest American degrees and the honor degre<e of 
Oxford and Cambridge it is hard to make any comparison.” 
The number of different kinds of degrees conferred by American colleges and 
universities is constantly increasing and is very often the cause of considerable 
confusion. Thus, for instance, we find that the degree of Ph. B. (bachelor of 
philcsophy) is giyen by one institution at the completion of a course of study 
for which in another institution the degree of B.S. (bachelor of science) is con- 
ferred. 
Value of the Ph. D. degree.—For some time past many of the leading colleges 
and universities and a few scientific associations of the United States have at- 
tempted, by resolutions and by example, to restore its original value to the de- 
gree of Ph. D. In Germany this degree is the reward purely of scholarship, 
_ which must be shown by examinations and other tests; but in this country the 
value of the degree has been greatly impaired by the fact that many of the col- 
leges confer it as an honorary doctorate. To such an extent has this custom 
spread that the American Philological Association, at a meeting in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, July, 1881, adopted the following resolution: : 
Whereas many colleges in the United States have in recent years cofiferred the degree of 
doctor of philosophy, not by examination, but honoris causa: Be it 
Resolved, That this association deprecates the removal of this degree from the class to which 
it belongs (namely, B, D., LL. B., M. D., and Ph. D., degrees conferred after examination), and its transfer to the class of honorary degrees. 
This resolution was concurred in by the American Association for the Ad- 
yancement of Science, at its meeting, held in Cincinnati, August, 1881. 
The following table, compiled from the annual reports of the Bureau from 
1873 to 1890, shows the number of honorary Ph. D. degrees conferred and the _ 
number of institutions so conferring the degree:

From this table it would appear that the protest from the above-named soci- 
eties had a temporary effect, as both the number of honorary Ph. D. degrees 
conferred and the number of. colleges conférring the degree was considerably 
less in 1882 than in 1881; but, though the number of such degrees conferred in 
succeeding years fluctuates considerably, there does not seem to be any tendency 
to abolish the custom, as will be seen by looking at the last year of the above — 
table. During this year both the number of degrees conferred and the num- 
ber of schools conferring them exceeded the numbers of any previous years. 
The custom is: opposed by many colleges. President Pepper, in his annual 
report to the board of trustees of Colby University in 1887, says : = 
“The faculty desire respectfully through this report to ‘express to the board 
their conviction thatthe degree of Ph, D. should never be conferred as an honor- 
ary degree, but only, as is now the custom in the best colleges and universities, — 
on those whe by completing courses of study prescribed by the faculty under — 
conditions also prescribed, shall merit the degree. It seems to the faculty that 
-Colby, in consistency with its past history, “should do nothing to lower, but’ 
everything to maintain or raise, the value of the symbols of scholarship. u = 
That this recommendation was adopted-is shown in the report of President 
Small for 1890, which contains the following statement: 
“The faculty wish to express their gratification that the trustees voted at 
their last annual meeting to adopt the recommendationmade in 1887 by Dr. Pep- 
per, with reference to the degrees of doctor of philosophy. *.* * The ground ~ 
upon which the faculty based their support of Dr. Pepper’s recommendation was * 
that the degree referred to had a distinct meaning abroad, and that the leading - 
universities of this country had attempted to reserve it for the same use in the — 
United States. The degree is intended not as a distinction for men who have 
shown marked ability, or performed conspicuous service, but it is now used asa 
certification that, in addition to college instruction, the person upon whom itis 
conferred has had, at least three years of university training in the processes of 
‘original investigation, and has ‘proved his right to recognition as a ‘master 
workman’ by university examination and the publication of some results of 
original research.” He also says: ‘‘It is also manifestly improper for aninstitu- _ 
tion to grant that degree when it makes no pretension of furnishing the train- | 
ing which qualifies for it.” 
The sentiment here expressed by Dr. Small seems to be shared by the author- — 
ities of Rock Hill College,in the catalogue of which the following appears : es 
“Application is sometimes made to the college for the degree of doctor of 
philosophy. This of all degrees ought to be the reward of high merit, whether 
for work actually done in the field of philosophy or for an examination rigidly 
gone through before a faculty of philosophy. Itis not within the scope of a fac- 
ulty of science or a faculty of arts to pass upon this degree. It can bo legiti- 
mately conferred only bya university having a school and faculty of philosGp ag 
Proceeding from any other source it is valueless and misleading,” = 
If this sentiment was shared by a large number of the institutions which con- 
fer the Ph. D.as an honorary degree the evil would be rapidly diminished, but 
so long as a few of our leading universities persist in this custom itis not to be- 
supposed that the smaller colleges will drop it. 
Many of those who receive this degree for work done at some of the leading 
institutions make it a practice to write after the degree either the name or an 
abbreviation of the name of the institution by which the degree was conferred. 
If this practice were more generally followed by people who earn the degree it — 
might have some effect upon those colleges who do not provide courses of study 
leading thereto.

      164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Coeducation.-The fact that increasing attention is being bestowed upon the higher education of women is apparent not only from the number of colleges 
for women that are constantly being established, but from the number of institu- 
tions that are continually removing the barriers against the admission of women 
to their privileges. The great advance that has been made in this direction 
during the past ten years may be graphically presented by means of the follow- ingdiagram. This shows the ratio of coeducational institutions to the total number of colleges and universities (excluding colleges for women) for the years 
1880 and 1890: :

. Teaching force.—The total number of professors and instructors employed in 
the 415 institutions during the year under consideration was 7,918. This num- 
ber includes the instructors in all the departmentsof the institutions. The dis- 
tribution of instructors among the several departments is shown by the follow- 
ing diagram: 
  
  
  
  II.—Diagram showing the distribution of professors and instructors among the several de- 
partments of colleges and universities. 
From this representation it will be seen that a little more thin half the total 
number of professors instruct in the collegiate department, counting those in- 
structing in both collegiate and preparatory departments. Of the 7,918 profes- 
sors and instructors reported 1,083 were women. Thegreat majority of thisnum- 
ber were engaged as instructors in music, art, and elocution, or as assistants to 
professors. An examination of the catalogues of the 272 coeducational institu- 
tions shows that in 134 of them women have charge of some regular college stud- 
ies. This includes not only the cases where women have the title of ‘‘ professor,” 
but also cases where they are called ‘‘instructor,” but have charge of the sub- 
ject specified. Nearly all of the coeducational institutions have women in their

corps of instructors, but, as said before, the large majority of these are engaged 
as assistants or as instructors in music, art, etc. The same investigation also 
showed that 24 of the coeducational institutions have women as members of their 
boards of trustees.

The graduate students form a very small percentage of the total number, not- 
withstanding the remarkable increase in this respect during the past twenty 
. years.’ As would naturally be expected, much the larger proportion of all the 
students are males, though this ratio is being constantly decreased. The ac- 
companying diagram shows the proportion of males and females reported in all a 
departments of colleges and universities : a

Taking only the regular college students—that is, students pursuing under- 
graduate college courses, we find that the proportion of males is larger than 
when the students in all departments are considered. The total number of stu-

Comparing Diagrams vi and vit it will be seen that the North Atlantic Divi- 
sion is the only one in which the proportion of college students is greater than 
the proportion of institutions. This is somewhat changed when we consider the 
students in all the departments, the distribution of which is as follows:

Income.—The sources from which colleges and universities draw their annual 
- income forms another interesting subject for investigation. The total income 
reported for 1889-90 was $10,801,918, derived from tuition fees, productive funds, 
State or municipal appropriations, and from miscellaneous sources. The ratio 
which the income derived from each of these sources bears to the total income 
is shown in the following diagram :

1IX.—Diagram showing the sources of income of colleges and universities. 
As would be expected, the amount of income derived from productive funds 
is greater than that from any other source, while the amount derived from tui- 
tion feesis but alittle more than one-third of the total. As institutions supported 
by tuition fees nearly always expend their total annual income the small pro- ~ 
portion of the cost of college education paid by students is again forcibly brought 
out. The inference is that vigorous institutions for higher education can not be 
self-supporting, but must receive aid from sources other than tuition fees. Ee 
The income derived from permanent funds was $3,966,083, distributed among 
the several geographical divisions as follows:

      mparing diagram VI (p..766), showing the ratio of institutions in the several 
‘ions with the above diagram, it will readily be seen that the institutions of 
‘the North Atlantic Division are more generously endowed than those of the 
other divisions of the country. The institutions in this section are, comparatively 
speaking, old institutions with well-established reputations, having alumni 
attered throughout the entire country. The rich man with money to give for 
educational purposes naturally turns to his alma mater, and, if he is not a col- — 
lege graduate, he designates an institution or institutions with well-established 
reputations. Thus the older institutions are constantly receiving large and ~ 
numerous benefactions. The gifts and bequests to colleges and universities 
- amounted in 1889-90 to $6,006,474, the distribution of which is shown in the fol- 
lowing diagram : TS

_ The institutions of the North Atlantic Division received, as will be seen, 45.5 
per cent of the tetal amount. The advantages possessed by this division in the 
matter of productive funds and benefactions are somewhat offset in some of the 
other divisions by State appropriations for current expenses.

XIIL.—Diagram showing the proportion of State or municipal appropriations received by the

  Tho North Atlantic Division reports 11.2 per cent of the appropriations here 
considered. Nearly the whole of this was received by the College of the City 
of New York from the city of New York, which it serves as ahighschool. The 
North Central Division reports 61.8 per cent of the total. In this division State 
universities have met with considerable favor, and the States have, as a rule, 
dealt with them very generously. It will also be seen that although nearly all 
the States comprising the South Central Division have State universities, the 
amount appropriated for their support was exceedingly small. They depend 
chiefly for their support upon students’ fees and the income from productive 
funds. In a large number of the State universities tuition is free to residents of 
the State, and in the few cases where tuition is not free the charges have been 
made as low as the resources of the institutions would allow.

III.—DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS IN DEGREE COURSES. 
Table 2, page 773, presents, in a form convenient for comparison, the distri- 
bution of undergraduate students in the several degree courses for the succes- 
sive years from 1886-87 to 1889-90. During the past few years the statistics 
necessary for the compilation of this summary have been given by the different 
_ institutions with a marked degree of accuracy and in considerable detail, thus 
enhancing the value of this representation. 
The summary furnishes an indication of the trend of college education, which 
is virtually determined by the relative predominance of different courses of 
study for a period of time. z : 
From an examination of the statistics included in this table it appears that 
the ratio of students in what is known as the classical or A. B. course is slightly 
decreasing. The greatest decrease is shown in the South Central Division, 
where the ratio in the classical or A. B. course has dropped from 59 per cent in 
1886-87 to 47.9 per cent in 1889-90. It will also be seen that the South Atlantic 
Division continues to draw a larger ratio of its students to the A. B. course than 
any other section of the country. The movement here indicated, 7. ¢., the de- 
crease of students in the A. B. course, will not be a surprise to anyone who has 
studied the subject of collegiate education in America during recent years. 
The colleges and universities of the country are continually forming new courses 
of study for which evidently there is a demand. But, notwithstanding the 
multiplication of courses leading to degrees other than the A. B., the number 
of students pursuing the A. B. course is still greater than the sum of all the 
students pursuing other degree courses. 
The degree of A. B. does not at present necessarily imply that its possessor 
has acquired a classical education, for there are institutions that confer this 
degree on the completion of courses of study in which neither Latin nor Greek 
are included. 
It is a matter of great regret that statisties showing the classification of stu- 
dents by-courses for a long pericd of years can not be obtained. In making 
comparisons the data used should be for at least a period of ten years, so that 
temporary fluctuations of any sort whatsoever would be avoided. But, since 
such complete data do not exist, the reader and investigator must content him- 
self with the briefer record. 
A glance at the statistics will show that the percentage of students pursuing 
regular degree courses has increased with considerable regularity since 1886-87, 
the time when these statistics were first collected. It will also be noted that 
it is in the older portions.of the country, the North and South Atlantic Divi- 
sions, in which the classical course has the deepest hold upon college students, 
while in the more recently settled regions more attention is given to the sci- 
ences and courses of study in which the ancient classics seldom find a place.

"~ “IV.—ENDOWMENT FUNDS OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
    
      
   
   
   
    
       
    
   
         
    
   
     
   
     
    
    
     
    
   
   
        
   
       
      
   
    Although the number of colleges and universities in the United States is cons 
'stantly i increasing, both by the foundation of new institutions and iby the develop- 
“ment of institutions from secondary schools to colleges, this increase in the 
number of institutions has not thus far affected to any perceptible degree the 
increase in the endowment funds of the older institutions of the country. 
The gifts of the people to higher institutions have been large and numerous 
and seem to be keeping pace with the increase in the population and wealth of 
the country. During the past few years a number of rich bequests have been 
‘made to old institutions, and also in not a few cases for the foundation of new 
institutions. The most notable of the latter are Clark University, Worcester, 
_ Mass., University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill., Catholic University, Washington, 
D. C., and Leland Stanford Jr. University, Palo Alto, Cal. 
On account of the failure of a number of institutions to report to the Bureau 
from year to year a comparison between the total amounts of productive funds 
in 1880 and in 1890 would not show the true rate of increase in the funds during 
. the last ten vears. 
_ The following tabular statement includes, first, only the institutions that re- 
_ . ported on this subject in both 1880 and in 1890, and, second, all the institutions 
that reported in either On From the first ‘showing the’ average rate of in-

From this tabie it will be seen that, while the increase in the productive funds — 
of the 191 institutions distributed over the entire country is 77.3 per cent, the 
largest increase has taken place in the forty-two institutions of the North At- 
jJantic Division, which reported, in 1889-90, more than 56 per cent of the total 
amount included in the above table. The poorest showing is made by the in- 
stitutions of the Western Division, but this can be accounted for in a measure 
by the small number of institutions reporting in 1880 and the number of new 
institutions that have been founded during the decade. : 
The most remarkable increase recorded is in the State of Louisiana. This is 
due to the establishment of the Tulane University of Louisiana, which is the’ 
successor of the old University of Louisiana. It has at present an endowment. 
fund of more than $1,000,000. 
The total number of colleges “and universities reporting to the Bureau in 
1889-90 was 415, and of this number but 315 answered the question relating to — 
productivefunds. Among those not answering this inquiry were Clark Uni- 
versity, Princeton, Rutgers, Dartmouth, and Haverford, allof which have large — 
endowment funds, and would have materially increased the total amount for — 
1889-90. The figures here given show an increase of 71.6 per cent, which would 
be considerably larger if all the institutions had reported. 
V.—GROUNDS, BUILDINGS, AND APPARATUS. 
_ Inconsidering the resources of institutions for higher education the material 
equipment, such as grounds, buildings, and apparatus, must notbe lost sight of. 
The increase in the value of appliances is due, in great measure, tothe increased 
attention given to the sciences and the consequent erection and equipment of — 
laboratories for experiments andresearch. The substantial and ornamental style 
of architecture which has been adopted in the erection of college buildings has in-. 
ereased the cost of buildings while adding considerably to the general appear- 
ance of the college campus. In the following table an attempt is made to pre-~- 
sent in a convenient form the value of grounds, buildings, and apparatus of col- 
leges and universities for the years 1879-80 and 1889-90." In order to show the © 
rate of increase the table is divided into two parts, the first part containing sta- 
“tistics of such institutions only as reported in both 1879-80 and 1889-90, while — 
the second part includes all the institutions that reported in either of the years 
under consideration.

, VI.—STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
The establishment and-management of State universities form an interesting 
subject for study and investigation. As early as 1787 the General Government 
passed an ordinance setting aside two townships of land in what is now Ohio 
for the support of a‘‘university,” and this precedent has been followed in the case 
of nearly every State since admitted into the Union. The funds derived from the 
sale of these lands have in almost every instance been devoted to the support of 
State universities, andif properly managed would have yielded handsome en- 
   
-P-A-G-E-189
fa ; ae ; oo - : 
dowment funds for such institutions. Butin many cases the persons to whom 
the management of the lands was intrusted were in too great a hurry to disp: 
of them, often sacrificing them at a ridiculously low figure; in some cases they 
‘served as a means of ‘‘ booming” a particular State, the lands being advertised 
ard sold at very low rates, thus inducing settlers to locate; in a few cases, where 
the States disposed of the land and assumed the indebtedness therefor, the fun 
have been mismanaged and sometimes very much impaired. 
The mismanagement of these lands and the funds derived therefrom has 
served one good purpose. The newer States, profiting by the experience of t 
older, are disposing of their lands advantageously, and by the time all of them 
are sold their universities will have endowments far exceeding those of the 
older institutions. : “ a 
_ In a number of cases the funds derived from the sale of university lands ha 
been considerably augmented by the land grantof 1862, which was given by 
some of the States to the State universities, while in other cases the fund was 
used for the establishment of separate and distinct institutions. : 
The State universities have also as a rule been generously treated by the le; 
islatures of their respective States in the matter of annual and special appro- 
priations. Very recently the legislature of Missouri granted to the State Uni- 
versity at Columbia the direct tax refunded to the State by the General Gover: 
ment, amounting to $647,900. This amount is to be added to the permanent 
endowment fund, increasing the latter to $1,180,946. * 
The statistics of State universities for the year under consideration are given 
in the table on the following page. :

  VII.—DENOMINATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 
The majority of institutions for higher education in this country are at pres- ~ 
ent carried on under the auspices of the several religious denominations. As 
stated before, the total number of institutions reporting to the Bureau in 1889-90 
is 415, and of this number but 99 claim to be nonsectarian, leaving 316 that are 
under the control of some religious sect. It must not, however, be inferred that 
the instruction in denominational institutions has asectarian bias. Onthe con- f 
trary a large number of them state particularly that their teaching is entirely f 
Ses eae and that students will not be disturbed in their respective religious 
beliefs. 
These denominational institutions have been the pioneers of higher education 
in several States, and have, at least in the Western States, prepared the way 
for the establishment of good State institutions. This they have succeeded in 
doing, not by advocating the establishment of such institutions; but by creating 
and fostering a desire for knowledge and making the people of the several com- 
munities realize the value of a liberal education. This much accomplished, the — 
establishment of a State university naturally followed, the funds having been 
provided by the land policy of the General Government in setting aside certain 
tracts of land for the purpose of founding institutions of learning. 
The proceeds arising fromthe sale of these lands are generally used in the si 
establishment of new institutions in preference to giving themoney to some one

of the institutions already in operation. This is rendered necessary by reason — 
of the denominational relations of nearly all institutions for higher education not 
under State control. To give public money to any one of these institutions would 
_ cause a great deal of jealousy and bitterness throughout the State. Again, if 
the money were distributed among the different institutions of the States a great 
deal of. its effectiveness would be destroyed. Thus it will be seen that the States 
have, as a rule, adopted the most feasible plan. The number of institutions 
under the control of the several religious denominations is as follows:

VIII.—ORGANIZATION OF A NUMBER OF LEADING UNIVERSITIES. 
Having shown the organization of the State universities, an attempt is here 
made to present in a somewhat similar manner the organization of a number of 
other leading institutions for higher education in the United States. These 
institutions are well equipped not only with able professors and instructors, 
excellently chosen libraries, and scientific apparatus, but with valuable build- 
ings and large productive funds, both of which are necessary for effective work. 
“Nearly all of the selected institutions provide for advanced work in graduate 
departments in addition to the regular undergraduate and professional courses. 
They are well supplied not only with endowed professorships, but also with fel- 
lowships and scholarships to assist students in obtaining an education. 
As will be observed, all the institutions with two exceptions are located in 
the extreme eastern section of the country, and among them are included the 
oldest institutions of the country. They are arranged in the order of their or- 
ganization. ‘The number of professors and students in the several departments 
in 1889-90 is given.

IX.—REORGANIZATION OF COLUMBIA COLLEGE. 
One of the most significant occurrences of the year was the reorganization of * 
Columbia College, New York. President Low, in his report for 1889-90, treats 
this subject very fully, and the following facts are taken therefrom. ae 
_ On the 6th of February, 1890, Columbia College in the city of New York, con- ‘ 
sisted of the School of Arts, the School of Law, the Schoo! of Mines, and the 
School of Political Science. In addition to these schools, which are under the 
direct control of the trustees of the college, the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons had become the Medical Department of Columbia College. The president, 
‘however, and the board of trustees have no responsibility as towards the medi- 
cal department.' 
Each of these schools, the School of Arts, the School of Law, the Schooi of 
Mines, and the Schqpl of Political Science, had its own faculty, and each was 3 
administered without any reference to the others, almost without any conscious- ° 
ness of the others. There were indeed students of one school taking some 
            
  1 This state of affairs has since been changed, and the.medical department now enjoys the 
benefits of the reorganization of the university, 
       
-P-A-G-E-198
  790 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
studies in one or another of the other schools, but in order to do this they were 
obliged to matriculate and pay the fee of $5 in each school in which they studied. 
Seniors in the School of Arts were .permitted to elect certain subjects in the 
other schools. In fact, the attitude of the institution towards the student was 
one of multiplied opportunities, but opportunities held more or less out of rela- 
e tion to each other. What seemed especially to be needed, from the point of 
view of the student, was such a unification of the institution as would make its 
- varied opportunities more available to those students whose equipment and 
capabilities justified them in desiring to study in more than one school. 
_ The graduate work also stood in need of organization. It had grown to con- 
siderable proportions, but depended too much upon individual professors. There 
was no general standard to which all must conform. 
‘Hor this purpose,” says President Low, ‘‘it was necessary to secure a bod 
which could, in effect, direct the graduate work where it concerned itself wit. 
more than one school and provide a common standard for all the schools. In- 
cidentally it was desirable, if possible, to place this work, in its general phases, 
under the charge of faculties rather than of individuals.” 
» A faculty of philosophy was formed to take charge of the advanced work in 
philosophy, philology, and letters. The central body or university council was 
then formed, based primarily on the four university faculties of law, mines, po- 
litical science, and philosophy, which between them comprise all the professors 
entitled to a seat in any faculty, and yet no professor sits in any more than one 
of them. The council was made to consist of twelve members, four of whom are 
men of letters, four of whom are men of science, and four of whom are men of 
law and political science. 
It was decided that every student should matriculate simply as a student of 
Columbia, paying but the one matriculation fee, and thereafter that the-facili- _ 
ties offered by any faculty or by all should be open to him, subject, of course, to 
any necessary regulations. Thus atone stroke Columbia ceased to be divided 
into fragments, and took upon herself the aspect of a university, wherein each 
department was related to every other and every one strengthened all. 
The general control of the graduate work was also placed. into the hands of 
the university council. ‘‘ The result,” says President Low, “‘ has been to secure 
a common basis of requirement for the degrees of master of arts and doctor of 
philosophy, under whatever university faculty they may be obtained, which 
common basis represents a combination, for the most part, of the best require- 
ments hitherto maintained in any quarter.” ~ 
“The most important result of the reorganization of the institution thus far 
attained in its bearing upon the college proper is seen in the enlarged option 
already given to the members of the senior class. By a unanimous vote of the 
faculty of the School of Arts, it was resolved that courses under any university 
faculty designated by such faculty as open to seniors should be accepted as op- 
tional courses for seniors in the School of Arts. This action, being referred by 
the trustees to the president and university council with power, was unani- 
mously indorsed by them. The senior year is thus made the point of contact 
between the college and the university. This arrangement, while it has the 
advantage of maintaining the dignity of the faculty of the college proper as a 
degree-granting faculty, has the other undoubted advantage of making the 
bachelor’s degree seem, not so much the end of a student’s course, as what it 
ought to be, merely am incident on the way to the true goal, the professional 
- degree, or the degree of doctor of philosopy. While it in no way cheapens the 
bachelor’s degree, it does shorten by one year the time required for the college 
and professional course combined.” 
X.—NEW INSTITUTIONS. 
Clark University, Worcester, Mass., was first opened for instruction, October 2, 
1889. This institution was founded and endowed by Mr. JonasG. Clark. Among 
the reasons given by Mr. Clark for choosing Worcester as the seat of the new 
foundation is the following: ‘‘ Because its location is central among the best 
colleges of the East, and by supplementing rather than duplicating their work, 
he hopes to advance all their interests and to secure their good will and active 
support, that, together, further steps may be taken insthe development of 
superior education in New England.” : 
‘The corner stone of the main building was laid on October 22, 1887. The build- 
ing is plain, substantial and well appointed, 204 x 114 feet, four stories high, and 
fivein the centre, with superior facilities for heating, lighting, and ventilation, 
_ and has been constructed of brick and granite, and finished throughout in oak. 
The chemical building, erected in 1888, is constructed throughout of brick. The

dimensions of the building are 134.6 x 135 feet; the main body of the building is 
three stories, and the southwestern wing is two stories high. Another de- 
partment building is in course of erection. 
On April 3, 1888, Dr. G. Stanley Hall, then professor of psychology at Johns 
Hopkins University, was invited to the presidency. The official letter convey- 
ing this invitation-contained the following expression, showing the liberal spirit » 
animating the trustees and their confidence in the man whom they wished to 
honor: ‘They desire to impose on you no trammels; they have no friends for 
whom they wish to provide at the expense of the interests of the institution; no-  ~ 
pet theories to press upon you in derogation of your judgment; no sectarian 
tests to apply; no guarantees to require, save such as are implied by your ac- 
ceptance of this trust. Their single desire is to fit men for the highest duties 
of life, and to that. end, that this institution, in whatever branches of sound 
learning it may find itself engaged, may be a leader and alight.” 
Having accepted this invitation, Dr. Hall was granted a year’s leave of absence 
with full pay in order to inspect universities in Europe. During thisyear he 
visited every European country but Portugal, conferring with ministers of 
education, heads of universities, and leading scientific men. As aresult of his 
investigations Dr. Hall, in his first annual report to the board of trustees, thus 
defines the work of Clark University: 
“J, It must be of the highest and most advanced grade, with special promi- 
nence given to original research. “This our country chiefly lacks and needs for 
both its material and educational welfare. This is in the current ofall the best 
tendencies in the best lands, and is the ideal to-day of, I believe, about every 
scientific man, who is able and in earnest, throughout the world. For this our 
location offers the rarest opportunities and inducements yet possible in this 
country. 
$625 We must not attempt at once to cover the entire field of human knowledge, 
but must elect a group of related departments of fundamental importance, and 
concentrate all our care to make these the best possible. Each science has be- 
come so’ vast and manifold that it is impossible to cultivate the frontier of all at 
a single university. This is moreand more recognized abroad, and is still more 
true under our American system of private endowment than on the European 
plan, with a national treasury todraw from. If coming universities, instead of 
imitating, would supplement others, will elect each its group of studies, all the 
gain in economy and effectiveness which skilled labor has over unskilled will 
be secured in the field of highest education. 
“3. For our group we chose at first five fundamental and related sciences. 
Work in science can be quickest organized. Great libraries and museums, and 
everything else that only age can bring, can be dispensed with at first, and a 
complete outfit of the best apparatus and of all needed books can be gathered in 
ashort time. Again, this isa practical country, and its industries are sure to 
depend more and more on the progress of science. So far, we have utilized _ 
science with extraordinary ingenuity in our inventions, but have done compara- 
tively little to create or advance it. We desire to make a patriotic endeavor to 
develon American discoverers as well as inventors. Finally, and above all, 
science, with its modern methods, has become an unsurpassed school of diseip- 
line, culture, and reverence. 
“4, We must seek the most talented and best-trained young men. We must - 
not exploit them for the glory of the institution, work them in a machiné, nor 
retard their advancement, but we must give them every needed opportunity and 
incentive. Their salaries must be among the very best in the country; yet we 
must not ask them to spend their best energies in teaching and earning tuition 
fees for the university, and must leave open all possibilities, should such prob- 
lems as individual fees, a periodic year in Europe, etc., arise later. We must 
give to those who know how to value it such facilities as we are able, that they 
may work for science and for themselves, requiring in return only a limited 
amount of mutual instruction, special and advanced enough to aid rather than 
divert from research (and no one is so éager and so able to teach the few fit as 
a discoverer), and careful conformity to a few obvious regulations.” 
The five sciences selected by the university are mathematics, physics, ehem- 
istry, biology, including anatomy and physiology, and psychology, ineluding 
neurology, anthropSlogy, criminology, and history of philosophy. In addition 
to these, modern languages are taught in a way to meet the practical needs of 
studentsin thesedepartments. The policy of the institution is,first,to strengthen 
the departments already established, and then proceed to the establishment of 
those which are scientifically most closely related to the established depart- - 
ments. z ‘ 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
    EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  According to the register for 1889-90, no clearly marked lines exist between 
instructors and students. Fellows and scholars who have attained some degree 
of mastery in a special line of work give brief special courses, which are often 
attended by professors. This is a stimulus to the student, and both tests and 
exhibits his powers in teaching. The total number of professors and students 
during the first session of the institution was 60, selected in part only from 
about 900 applicants for various positions. The number selected included grad- 
uates from forty-eight different universities and colleges. Only graduate stu- 
- dents, or those of equivalent attainments, are admitted, unless in rare and special 
cases. The tuition fee is $200 per annum. 
The University of the Northwest, Sioux City, Iowa, was opened for instruction in 
September, 1890. It is located at Morningside, a suburb of Sioux City, and is 
reached by the elevated railway. The institution is under the fostering care of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church, but is free from sectarianism, and will be con- 
ducted on broad Christian principles. The following departments have been 
established: Preparatory department; college of liberal. arts; college of com- 
" ‘merce; college of didactics ; college of law; conservatory of music, and college 
    of medicine, The college of medicine will be opened in September, 1891. 
Lake Charles College, incorporated under the Louisiana statutes, June 22, 1887, 
is located at Lake Charles, in southwestern Louisiana. The college, prepara- 
tory and academic departments were opened for instruction, October 1, 1890. 
The institution is open to both sexes. The home life of the college is after the 
“ cottage plan,” and separate cottages are provided for young ladies and gentle- 
men, each accommodating about thirty students. Each cottage is under the care 
of a matron. 
Parker College, Winnebago City, Minn., was founded by the Free Baptists, and 
was first opened for instruction in September, 1888. The college has $100,000 
worth of property, $65,000 of which is productive endowment. 
- Cotner University, Lincoln, Nebr., was first opened for instruction in 1889, under 
the name of Christian University, which was changed to its present name 
on the Ist of June, 1890, This institution was established by the Christian 
Church of Nebraska, and is under the presidency of David R: Dungan, A. M. 
The courses already established are collegiate preparatory, normal preparatory, 
special Biblical, and medical. Other courses will be established when needed. 
Black Hills College, Hot Springs, S. Dak., was founded by the Black Hills Mis- 
sion of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and opened for instruction on Thurs- 
day, September 11, 1890.. The college building is constructed of gray sandstone. 
It is 54 feet wide, 74 feet long, and three stories high. The recitation halls are 
large, commodious, and well lighted. The campus is agently rolled tract of land 
comprising 20 acres situated in the very center of the town. 
University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.—One of the most generous benefactors to 
the cause of education is Mr. John D. Rockefeller, a prominent member of the 
Baptist church. When the Board of American Baptist Education Society, in 
May, 1889, decided to establish a well-equipped college in the city of Chicago, 
Mr. Rockefeller made a subscription of $600,000 towards the purpose, which sum 
was increased during the succeeding year by about $600,000 more in subscrip- 
tions, representing more than two thousand persons. Three months after the 
completion of this subscription, Mr. Rockefeller made an additional proffer of 
$1,000,000. The following are the formal terms in which these subscriptions 
were made: 
x May 15, 1889, 
Rey. FRED. T. Gates, Corresponding Secretary 
AMERICAN Baptist EDUCATION SOCIETY: 
My Dear Sir: I will contribute $600,000 toward an endowment fund for a col- 
lege to be established at Chicago, the income only of which may be used forcur- 
rent expenses, but not for land, buildings, or repairs, providing $400,000 more is 
pledged by good and responsible parties, satisfactory to the Board of the Ameri- 
can Baptist Education Society and myself, on or before June 1, 1890, said $400,- 
000, or as much of it as shall be required, to be used for the purpose of purchas- 
ing land and erecting buildings, the remainder of the same to be added to the 
above $600,000 as endowment. 
I will pay the same to the American Baptist Education Society in five years, 
beginning within ninety days after completion of the subscription as above and 
pay 5 per cent each ninety days thereafter until all is paid; providing not less 
than a proportionate amount is so paid by the other subscribers to the $400,000;

The institution was chartered September 10, 1890, as the University of Chi 
cago, and the management of the corporation is Veste d in a board of twenty-one 
trustees. The qualifications of the trustees and of the president of the Univer- 
sity are thus set forth in the application for the charter: . 
“At all times two-thirds of the trustees and also the president of the University 
and of its said college shall be members of regular Baptist churches—that is to 
say, members of churches of that denomination of Protestant Christians now 
usually known and recognized under the name of the regular Baptist denomina- 
tion; and as contributions of money and property have beep and are being so- 
licited, and have been and are being made, upon the conditions last named, this 
charter shall not be amended or changed at any time hereafter so as to abrogate 
or modify the qualifications of two-thirds of the trustees and the president above 
mentioned, but in this particular this charter shall be forever unalterable. 
“No other religious test or particular religious profession shall ever be held as 
a requisite for election to said board, or for admission to said University, or to 
any department belonging thereto, or which shall be under the supervision or 
control of this corporation, or for election to any professorship, or any place of 
honor or emolument in said corporation, or any of its departments or institu- 
tions of learning.” 
The site of the University consists of three blocks of ground lying between the 
two South Parks of Chicago, and fronting on the Midway Plaisance, which is a 
park connecting the other two. One-half of this site was given by, Marshall 
Field, of Chicago, and the other half was purchased at a cost of $132,500. 
William R. Harper, Ph. D., professor of the Semitic languages and Woolsey — 
professor of Biblical literature in Yale University, was elected to the presidency 
at the first meeting of the board. He has decided to accept the position to 
which he was elected by the unanimous vote of the board. 
The work of the University will probably be begun in October, 1892, and is 
thus set forth in Official Bulletin No. 1, published by the trustees: 
The work of the University shall be arranged under three general divisions, 
viz., The University Proper, The University- -Extension Work, The University 
Publication Work. 
1, THE UNIVERSITY PROPER will include— 
(1) Academies: The first academy of the University will be established, in ac- 
cordance with the terms of the gift of Mr. John D. Rockefellgyge Morgan Park, 
Til. Others will be organized or affiliated as rapidly as favofable opportunities 
are presented. 
(2) Colleges: Of these there will be organized— 
(a) The College of Liberal Arts, in which the curriculum will be arraised with 
a view to the degree of B. A. 
(0) The College of Science, in which the curriculum will be arranged with a 
view to the degree of B. S. 
           
-P-A-G-E-202
  794 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
(c) The College of Literature, in which the curriculum will be arranged with 
special view to. the study of Modern Languages and Literature, History, etc., 
with a view, likewise, to the degree of B.S. : 
(d) The College of Practical Arts, in which the curriculum will be arranged 
with greater reference, than in the other Colleges, to the practical departments 
of business and of professional life, with a view to the degree of B.S. 
_ (3) Affiliated colleges: The character of affiliation will be determined by exist- 
ing circumstances in particular cases. 
{4) Schools: Of these, there will be organized— 
(a) The Graduate School, which will include all graduate work of a nonpro- 
fessional character. 
(b) The Divinity School, which will include the curriculum of study ordinarily ~ 
- presented by Divinity Schools. 
As-soon as the funds of the University permit, there will also be established— 
(a The Law School. 
d) The Medical School. 
e) The School of Engineering, which will include civil, mechanical, and eles- 
trical engineering. 
f) The: School of Pedagogy. 
9) The School of Fine Art. i 
) The School of Music. 
2. THE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION WORK, which will include— 
(1) Regular courses of lectures, delivered in and about the city of Chicago, in 
accordance with the best developed plans of University Extension. 
_ _ (2) Evening courses in college and university subjects, in and about the city of 
Chicago, for men and women whose daily occupation will not permit them to 
take advantage of the regular college and university courses. 
(3) Correspondence courses in college and university subjects for students resid- 
ing in all parts of the country whose circumstances donot permit them to reside 
» at an institution of learning during all of the year. 
(4) Special courses in a scientific study of the Bible in its original languages 
and in its translations, to be conducted by University instructors at the Univer- 
sity at times which shall not conflict with Uviversity work. 
(5) Library Extension, in connection with the preceding forms of University 
Extension work. 
3. THE UNIVERSITY PUBLICATION WORK, which will include— 
(1) The printing and publishing of University bulletins, catalogues, and other 
official documents. 
(2) The printing and publishing of special papers, journals, or reviews of a 
scientific character, prepared or edited by instructors in the various departments 
of the University. 
(83) The printing and publishing of books prepared or edited by University in- 
structors. 
(4) The collecting, by way of exchange, of papers, journals, reviews, and books 
similar to those published by the University. 
; (5) The purchase and sale of books for students, professors, and the University 
ibrary. 
The general regulations published by this institution will undoubtedly attract 
considerable attention on account of the many new features that will be intro- 
duced. Instead of the customary three months’ suspension of work during the 
summer, the year is divided, for the purpose of instruction, into four quarters, 
beginning on the 1st day of October, January, April, and July, and continuing 
twelve weeks each, thus leaving a week between the end of one quarter and the 
beginning of the next. Each quarter is divided into two terms of six weeks 
each. Students will be allowed to take as vacation any one of the four quarters, 
or two terms of six weeks in different parts of the year. By attending four 
quarters per year, students will be able to complete the course in three years. 
The courses of instruction will be classified as majorsand minors. The major 
will call for 10 to 12 hours of.class-room work each week, the minor for 4 to 6 
hours. All courses are to continue six weeks, but the same subject may be 
continued through two or more successive terms either as a major or aminor. 
The regulations regarding the teaching body will be fully appreciated by the 
members thereof. Each resident professor or teacher shall lecture thirty-six 
weeks of the year, 10 to 12 hours a week, and no instructor shall be required to 
lecture more than this amount. For any time that he may teach in addition to 
the threé-quarters required, he shall receive either an extra two-thirds pro 
rata salary or an extra full pro rata vacation. A teacher-who has taught three

years ‘of 48 weeks each, or six years of 42 weeks each, will thus be entitled to a 
year’s vacation on full salary.

INTRODUCTION. 
The subject of higher education has been so ably discussed and set forth dur- 
ing late years by the leading college men of the country that it will be profitable 
to reproduce here some of their remarks. 
Prominent among the subjects which have engaged attention is that of short- 
ening the time required to complete the college course. The proposition took — 
practical shape in the attempt made by the faculty of Harvard Collegeto reduce 
the time required for obtaining the A. B. degree. 
This attempt was made in the interest of those students who, after completing 
a college course take afull four years’ coursein medicine. By the method nowin 
practice the average age at graduation of such students, according to President 
Eliot, is between 26 and 27 years. That this is anevil and that something ought 
to be done to remedy it is generally admitted; but considgrable opposition has 
been developed to the propositions advanced with this end in view, more espe~ 
cially by the smaller colleges of the country. ‘To these institutions the abridg- 
ment of the course would mean, for some time at least, a diminished attendance 
and consequently a diminished income from tuition fees, while to replace this 
loss a larger increase in the productive funds of the colieges would be required. 
than there is any reasonable hope of obtaining. 
The Harvard plan of shortening the course is given farther on. Another and 
less radical measure looking to the accomplishment of the same purpose as the 
shortening of the college course has been proposed. This plan allows seniors to: 
_elect the first year studies of the professional department which they propose to 
enter; but this plan, it is evident, ean be adopted only by those institutions 
which have professional departments in close proximity to the college. oe 
Age of freshmen.—Befcre giving the views of college presidents om this sub- 
ject it maybe well to consider the age of college students. Am inquiry on this 
subject was addressed by this Office to the colleges and universities of this eoun=~ 
try. 220 of which have returned fairly satisfactory answers. The inquiry was 
worded as follows: ‘‘ How does-the average age of the members of the freshman. 
class in your institution compare with the average age ten years ago?” 
Of the 220 institutions replying, 102 reported the average age as being the 
same as ten years ago; 65. reported a lower average, and 53 a higher average. 
Of the 65 institutions in the second category 52 give the age as “‘slightly lower,” or 
‘less than one year;” 9 report it as being between one and two years lower, and 
4 report it as between two and three years lower. Of the53 that report the age as 
higher, 36 say itis slightly or less than one year higher, 12 report it as being 
between one and two years higher, and 5 report it as between two and three 
years higher. But we must not lose sight of the fact that in a large number of 
these institutions the requirements for admission have been raised considerably 
é 799

        EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. — 
during the last ten years, which would naturally have a tendency to raise the 
age at admission, provided no improvement had been made at the same time in 
the secondary schools preparing for the colleges. Of the 220 institutions an- 
swering the inquiry as to the age of their students, 81 say that the requirements 
‘for admission have been raised ; and of these 81 institutions the standard of 54 
has been raised without increasing the age; in fact, 23 of these 54 institutions 
say that the age is lower than ten years ago. The requirements for admission 
have been raised in 27 of the 53 institutions that report the age as having in- 
creased, and it may be well to note the fact that of the 12 institutionsin the North 
Atlantic Division reporting an increased age, 10 show an increase in the require- 
ments for admission. : .

ies On the assumption that all who ever joined each class were admitted as freshmen. 645 years old. c44years old. 
From this table it would appear that the average age has been increased in 
thirty-four years by alittle more than seventeen months. But let us inquire 
_into the manner of arriving at these results. The secretary of Harvard Uni- 
versity, in a communication received August 16, 1890, gave the average ago of 
the freshman classes for the last ten years as follows: 
  ‘Years. Hons. = Years. |Months. Years. |Months.

      _ As the figures in the president’s report did not agree with those given by the secretary, a letter was written to the latter asking him which of the two sets of ’ figures should be used in the compilations of the Bureau. The following reply - was received March 5, 1891: s 
_- “The table in the President’s report is the best authority, as it contains all recent changes and corrections in the age statistics. 
‘*The most marked changes are due to the embodying in the figures of per- sons entering the classes of 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1893 (i. e., the freshman classes 
marked 1887, 1888, 1889, and 1890) with advanced standing. For example: If a man comes from Yale or Amherst after graduation and enters our senior class

  af LENGTH OF COLLEGE CURRICULUM. 803 
his age is added to the freshman table of that class as though he had entered. 
three years earlier as a freshman. 
“As 73 men were admitted to advanced standing this year, youcan readily see. 
that the chance of change in the average is very strong. * * From what I 
have said you will see that the present figures for 1888, "1389, and 1890 will change 
slichtly until the classes of '92, 93. and 94 have been ‘graduated. ‘ 
Prior to 1873 the catalogues of Harvard do not show the presence in the under- _ 
graduate department of students who had already taken the a. B. degree at some . 
other college. In 18783 three such students were enrolled in the senior class, but 
the year when such degrees were received is not given until the year 1887. In 
order to show the number of such students in the different classes a rigid exam- 
ination of the catalogues has been made, with the following results : 
1873. Senior class, 3. 1885. Senior, 8; junior, 6. 
1874. Senior, 2; junior, 2. 1886. Senior, 8: junior, 1: sophomore, 1

he figures from 1873 to 1886, inclusive, have not much significance beyond — 
giving the number of such students, inasmuch as the years when the students 
, had received the A. B. degree are not given. In order to show to what an 
extent the aggregate age of the Harvard freshman classes are raised by the 
methods of computation employed by that institution, let us examine into the 
probable ages of students who had received the a. B. degree and were members 
of the senior class in 1889-90. By looking at the table above given we find that 
amember of that class had received his a. B, degree in 1880. Supposing that 
he was 22 years of age when he received his degree he would have been 31 
years old when he entered the senior class of Harvard. According to the 
method of computation there, as given by the secretary, his age as a freshman 
at Harvard is used as 28 years, when really he was a freshman at some other 
institution ten years before and had never been in the Harvard freshman class.. 
By means of such methods thirty-four years were added to the total of the ages 
of members of this freshman class by taking the ages of students who had al- 
ready received the degree of A. B. elsewhere. In our investigations no note 
was made of students who had received a degree other than A.B. Of these there 
are quite a number; there are also students who had not taken a degree, but 
were admitted to advanced standing. Some idea of the number of such students 
“in the different classes may be formed from the fact that in 1890 seventy-three 
students were admitted to advanced standing, while the catalogue shows the 
presence of but thirty-one students in the college who had already received the 
degree of A. B. at some other institution. The number of such students enter- 
ing the undergraduate department of Harvard is constantly increasing, and this 
faet will of course have the tendency to continually increase the average age of 
the freshman classes as this is now being computed. Nor is it likely thata 
large number of the graduates who thus raise the age will ever pursue the 
study of either law or medicine, but are merely pursuing liberal studies and 
very likely fitting themselves to teach. Speaking of these students, the dean 
of the graduate school of Harvard says: ‘‘A large proportion of these students 
should properly be classed in the graduate school; but many of them have 
elected to enter the undergraduate department in order to avail themselves of 
Price Greenleaf aid and of scholarships which can be given only to students of 
the college.” 
From the above statement of the dean it would appear that these students are 
not actuated so much by the desire to obtain the Harvard A.B. as’by the desire 
‘to receive Harvard aid for the purpose of pursuing post-graduate studies, and it 
seems that such students should not be included in the computations. The real 
average age of a freshman class is the average obtained from the ages while 
they are freshmen, and the average age of a senior class should be obtained by 
adding the ages of the members of the class and dividing it by the number of 
members in the class, and not by adding four yearsto the average age of the fresh- 
man class, for a sufficient number of students might have beend ropped tochange _

  materially the average age. From these statements and explanations it will be 
seen that in comparing the age of the Harvard freshman class with that of other 
institutions it must be borne in mind that the methods of computation employed 
by Harvard are different from those generally used, and the result does not rep- 
_ resent the age of the freshman class as such. 
Having shown that the increas? in the average age of freshmen during at 
least the last decade is not general,as proved by the facts collected from the 
colleges throughout the country, we will now proceed to set forth the views of 
the most prominent educators upon the length of the college course and the 
propriety of reducing it. In collecting these expressions of opinion, an effort 
has been made to present it from every point of view. It isa matter of great 
regret that the opinions from the smaller institutions are so few.. This is owing 
to the very small number of such institutions that publish the annual reports of 
'. their presidents. It is in these reports, and not in the general reports or cata- 
logues, that remarks and recommendations upon subjects pertaining to general 
college matters are as a rule found. 
PRESIDENT ELIOT AND THE ACTION OF THE HARVARD FACULTY. 
The first remarks of President Eliot of Harvard on this subject appear in his 
annual report for 1885-86, where he calls attention, to the comparatively advanced 
age at which graduates of colleges and scientific schools begin the study of med- 
icine. In connection with this subject he says: ‘‘The average age at whichis 
Harvard graduates get the degree of A. B. is about 22 years and 7 months. 
such bachelors of arts then spend four years in the study of medicine, they are 
26 years and 7 months old when they are ready to begin the practice of their 
profession. The faculty consider this unreasonable postponement of entrance 
into practice a serious evil, which itis their duty to combat, since more than 
half of their students—and that much the best half—are graduates of colleges 
or scientific schools. They therefore laid before the acalemic council in June 
last a plan for the abridgment of the college course by those students who go 
from college directly into one of the professional schools of the university.” 
The medical faculty proposed that the first-year stadies of the medical school 
be counted, under certain conditions, for the degree of A. B., which proposal 
was concurred in by the law faculty. This would have resulted in shortening 
the college course by one year for students who should pursue their professional 
studies to the full limit in the Harvard schools. The general subject oi short- 
ening the college course was then (December, 1887) submitted to a committee 
of nine professors, appointed by the president, who were to consider the subject 
in all its relations. No report seems to have been made by the board when Pres- 
ident Eliot made his annual report for 1888-89, in which he again says: ‘‘ Wherever 
the fault and whatever the remedy, it is clear that the degree of bachelor of 
arts is taken in the United States later than in any other country in which the 
degree is used, and too late for. the best interests of the individuals who aspire 
to it and of the institutions which confer it.” 
On account of the pressure of other matters the college faculty was unable to 
give this subject full consideration until the year 1889-90, when eighteen meet- 
ings of the faculty, from November to March, were spent in its discussion. At 
last, March 25, 1890, the following was communicated to the president and fel- 
lows by vote (not unanimous) of the faculty : 
“The faculty desires to modify its present regulations in accordance with the 
following propositions : j 
“1, That the requirements for the degree of bachelor of arts be expressed 
under suitable regulations with regard to length of residence and distribution 
of work, in terms of courses of study satisfactorily accomplished. 
“2. That the number of courses required for the degree be sixteen. 
«3, That when a student enters college there shall be placed to his credit, 
towards satisfying the foregoing requirements of sixteen courses, (1) any ad- 
vanced studies on which he has passed in his admission examination beyond the 
number required for admission and (2) any other college studies which he has 
anticipated. 
‘4, That a student may be recommended for the degreé of bachelor of arts in 
the middle as well as at the end of the academic year. 
~ “Tn case the measures here proposed shall be adopted, it is the purpose of the 
faculty to encourage the anticipation of college studies by students at the time 
of their admission and to facilitate the attainment of the degree of bachelor of 
arts in less than four years. 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-213
  } LENGTH OF COLLEGE CURRICULUM. 805 
“The faculty further proposes to advise parents and teachers that eighteen 
_ years is a suitable age for entering Harvard College.” 
A comparison of these propositions with the present requirements for the de- 
gree of bachelor of arts shows that, though the faculty does not, in so many 
words, advocate the reduction of the course from four to three years, it pro- 
poses by a slight reduction in the requirements to make it possible for close or 
diligent students to attain the degree in three years. The requirements for the 
degree at present are 18.2 courses and in three years the student completes at 
least 14.2 courses; so that, if the proposition to reduce the requirements to six- 
teen courses should be adopted and the conditions should remain the same, the 
student will complete the course in about-three and one-half years, though, by 
anticipating some studies or by taking extra courses, as is frequently done even 
now, hard-working students would be enabled to complete the course in three 
years. It isto be remarked, however, that, although under the present condi- 
tions it is possible for students to complete the course in three years, very few 
have thus far accomplished it. According to the report of the dean of Harvard 
College for the year 1889-90 the number so completing the course during the — 
last ten years was twenty-seven,’ ten of whom graduated in 1890. 
In the same report the dean says: ‘‘Among the great mass of the present 
students there is unquestionably a sentiment in favor of the traditional four 
years’ course. Ifit should be made possible by moderate exertion to graduate 
in three years, there is nothing in the present attitude of the students to indi- 
cate that the majority would restrict their liberal training to this three years’ 
“minimum, any more than they are disposed to confine themselves to the mini- 
mum requirement of courses in any year. And these facts may well reassure 
those who fear that a general lowering of the standard of education would result 
from. the adoption of the faculty's proposals.” Another point that the dean.em- ~ 
‘phasizes is that even if the course be reduced as proposed the standard of the 
degree will still be considerably higher than it was twenty years ago. 
At the meeting of the Board of Overseers, October 8, 1890, the committee, to 
whom these propositions had been referred, submitted its report—only a qual- 
ified approval of the suggested changes—which was laid over for future action. 
The following are the principal recommendations made by the committee: 
“Voted, That the Board of Overseers concurs with the corporation in the ap- 
proval of the fourth proposal of the college faculty: that a student may be rec- 
ommended for the degree of bachelor of arts in the middle as well as at the 
end of the academic year. 
“Voted, That the Board of Overseers concurs with the corporation in its ap- 
proval of the third proposal of the college faculty, provided it be amended by 
striking out the words ‘the foregoing requirement of sixteen courses’ and 
substituting therefor the words ‘the requirements for the degree of bachelor of 
arts ;’ so that it shall read as follows: ‘That when a student enters college there 
shall be placed to his credit towards satisfying the requirements for the degree 
of bachelor of arts any advanced studies on which he has passed in his admis- 
sion examination beyond the number required for admission and any other col- — 
lege studies which he has anticipated.’ : 
“Voted, That the Board of Overseers does not concur with the corporation in 
its approval of the first and second proposals of the college faculty : that the re- 
quirements for the degree of A. B. be expressed under suitable regulations with 
regard to length of residence and distribution of work in terms of courses of 
study satisfactorily accomplished ; that the number of courses required for the 
degree be sixteen. 
- “Voted, That the Board of Overseers recommends the modification of the pres- 
ent regulations of the college faculty in accordance with the following proposi- 
tion: That a senior intending to enter the medical school and to take the full 
four years’ course therein may, under proper supervision, include in the require- 
ments for the degree of bachelor of arts the courses on physiology and anatomy 
required in the first year of the medical school, each of said courses to count ag 
one full elective course.” 
The committee thinks that if any time is lost it is in the preparatory schools, 
where considerable attention is given to athletics, etc. . 
The Board of Overseers, at a meeting in April, 1891, finally decided to reject 
all the proposals of the faculty. 
  
1 This includes, of course, only those students who entered as freshmen and completed the 
course in three years.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90.

   Andrew D. White, LL. D., in an article entitled ‘The future of American 
universities,” published in the North American Review for October, 1890, urges 
the reorganization of our college and university system. He calls attention to the 
_ very large number of colleges and universities in this country, especially to the 
number of small colleges with still smaller endowments, which possess all the © 
powers of universities’. Although Dr. White does not expressly recommend 
the shortening of the college course, his plan for the reorganization of cur uni- 
versity system would nevertheless accomplish that purpose, as well as reduce 
the age of college graduates. His plan is as follows: , 
 . “Let institutions of small endowment, whether called colleges or universities, 
frankly, take their rightful positions; let.them stop claiming to do work which 
their authorities know well that they can not accomplish in competition with 
the largely endowed universities. Let them accept the situation and begin 
their freshman year two years earlier than the present freshman year at mostof 
the better colleges; that is, let them put their roots down into the great public- 
school system of the country and draw copiously from it. A course of instruc- 
tion thus formed would begin with the beginning of the higher arithmetic, alge- 
bra, geometry, the principal modern languages, the elements of the natural 
sciences, and, for those who wish to study them, one or more of the ancient lan- > 
eS. 
oN ext, let this course in the intermediate college be®ontinued up to the point 
which is at present reached, as a rule, in our colleges and universities of a good 
grade at the beginning of the junior year. After its four years’ work, let the 
college bestow its diplomas or certificates upon its graduating classes and then 
let those who desire it be admitted into the universities upon the presentation 
of these certificates and diplomas. f : 
‘“‘ Next, as tothe universities. In these let there be courses of advanced study, 
_ general, professional, or technical, covering, we will say, three years, and grad- 
_ nating men into the various professions.” 
' According to this plan the degree of bachelor would be received two years 
earlier than it is at the present time. Butlet us see whateffect this would have 
_ upon the significance of the degrees. At the present time some of the large in- 
stitutions that confer the degree of doctor of philosophy demand three years of 
study after receiving the bachelor’s degree and none demand less than two years ; 
while, according to Dr. White’s plan, but one year’s study in addition to the 
time now required for the bachelor’s degree would suffice for the attainment of 
the PH. D. degree. 
PRESIDENT D. C. GILMAN. 
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., has for some time been maintain- 
ing courses of study leading to the degree of bachelor of arts and which were 
designed tobe completed in three years. In view of this fact, it might easily be 
~ expected that President Gilman would be an enthusiastic advocate of the short- 
tening of the college curriculum, but, as will be seen, he is very conservative on 
this subject. In an article entitled “‘Shortening the college curriculum,” pub- 
lished in the Educational Review for January, 1891, he says: 
“No general conclusion can be quickly reached on such a question. It must 
be settled in each institution according to its own circumstances. It must be 
tried in the local court before it is submitted to the court of appeals; that is, to < 
the public. It does not follow that if one institution, even the strongest and 
most influential, decides to shorten its course, others willlikewisedoso. * * * 
“The curtailment of the curriculum is chiefly urged for this reason: The 
number of persons who proceed to professional schools after taking a college 
- course is much smaller than it should be; it is diminishing; and those who 
pursue a collegiate and then a professional course postpone till too late a period 
- the actual business of life. For all such persons a year of preparatory work can 
well be spared.” £ 
- Farther on he says: ‘‘As remedial agencies for this acknowledged difficulty I 
make the following suggestions: ‘ 
(a) The authorities in our educational system should really, as well as nomi- 
nally, distinguish between the requirements of three scholastic periods, namely: 
  
1The chief blame for this condition in our country rests with the legislatures of the several 
States which grant these powers to institutions without defining the qualifications to be de- manded for the attainment of degrees. = 
  
-P-A-G-E-215
  The school, the college, and the university; or, in other words, between what is 
essential, what is liberal, and what is special in a prolonged education. 
(b) The period of college life; which of late years has been carried forward so 
that it extends on the average from 18,5 years to 22.5 years (in many, perhaps, 
most of the older colleges), may be brought back to an earlier age, say, from six- 
teen to twenty years. : 
(¢) The significance of the baccalaureate degree should be restored, so that it 
may be, at least, a trustworthy certificate, an approximate measure, both of the 
eapacity and of the acquisitions of the possessor. In one way or another a con- 
sensus should be reached as to the dignities, rights, and privileges to that degree 
appertaining. 
- (d@) The rigidity of the class system should be relaxed, so that those who are 
exceptionally favoréd or exceptionally strong may, if they choose, run the course 
in less than the average time, and likewise so that any who are embarrassed by 
ill health, the necessity of earning a support, or the inadequacy of their early — 
opportunities may spend more than the usual time without any implied discredit; 
indeed without attracting any attention. 
(e) The enormous waste of time and energy at. the school period, the time of 
preparation for college, must be stopped. 
Dr. Gilman says that the result of the adoption of these remedies would be 
that school life would usually end at sixteen years of age, college life at twenty, 
and the young man would receive his professional certificate or his diploma of 
doctor of philosophy at the ave of twenty-three years or thereabouts. 
He also says: ‘‘If then the stronger universities would take the ground that, 
as a rule, none should be admitted to the professional courses or to the freedom 
of university instruction until they had attained a bachelor’s degree, or in 
some other way acquired a corresponding preparation for advanced work, the 
reproaches of which we are conscious would soon disappear, and higher edu- 
eation would be more generally diffused, more wisely ordered, and more serv- 
iceable to the public.” 
ACTION OF COLUMBIA COLLEGE. 
Although Harvard may have been the first to call attention to the excessive 
age of those students who, after completing a college course, enter professional 
schcols, Columbia Coilege, New York, was the first to make provisions by which 
students can complete both courses at an earlier age. In order to accomplish 
this end an entire reorganization of the institution wasrendered necessary. As — 
a result of this reorganization,’ seniors in the School of Arts may select as op- 
tional courses such courses under any university faculty as may be designated 
by said faculty as being open to seniors. The senior year is thus made the point 
of contact between the college and the university. President Low, in speaking 
on this subject, says: ‘‘This arrangement, while it has the advantage of main- 
taining the dignity of the faculty of the college proper as a degree-granting 
faculty, has the other undoubted advantage of making the bachelor’s degree 
seem not so much the end of a student's course as, what it ought to be, merely * 
an incident on the way to the true goal, the professional degree, or the degree 
of doctor of philosophy. While it in no way cheapens the bachelor’s degree, 
it does shorten by one year the time required for the college and professional 
course combined.” ee 
PRESIDENT CHARLES. KENDALL ADAMS, LL. D. 
In his annual report for 1889-90, President Adams of Cornell University says 
there ought to be some means by which the work done in the last one or two years 
of the undergraduate course could be made to-apply directly in the interests of < 
those professional studies which students might desire to take up after complet- 
De their undergraduate work. After discussing the pee put in operation by 
Columbia College and that proposed by the faculty of Harvard University, he 
says: 1 
“Tt is not my object in this connection to express an opinion in regard to — 
either of these methods, but simply to point out that, whatever the weakness of 
either system may be, the substantially simultaneous efforts of two institutions 
as prominent as Harvard and Columbia to reduce the number of years necessary. 
tocomplete the requirements for an advanced degree-is one of unmistakable 
_ Significance. The movement will unquestionably have not a little importance 
in influencing the development of higher education within the next few years.”

808 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
ae PRESIDENT JAMES B. ANGELL, LL. D. 
- President Angell of the University of Michigan has a few words to say on-this 
subject in his last annual report. He remarks: 
- Tt certainly is desirable, and I believe possible, to save some time in the 
education of the men who take four years’ work in college and then their pro- 
fessional training. I am convinced that considerable time can be gained in the 
better arrangement of the work in schools. After the student is prepared for 
college, two plans for completing his education in briefer time than has usually 
been consumed are possible: 
“First. Only three years of college work may be asked for the bachelor’s de- 
‘gree. In that case the student must be required to do more work in each year 
than he has done heretofore in college, or the standard of attainment for grad- 
uation must be reduced. 
_ *Second. Substantially the plan which we have followed for several years 
may be adopted. The condition of attaining the bachelor’s degree is not meet- 
ing a requirement of time, but of work. One must complete so many courses of 
study, a part of which are fixed, a part elective. While in order to avoid cram- 
ming there is a limit to the number of courses which a student may undertake 
at once, still, with the liberty given, a capable and industrious man may easily 
meet the requirements for the degree of bachelor of arts in three and one-half 
ates and a few exceptionally strong men in each class may doit in three years. 
ut in case they are within half a year of graduation at the beginning of their 
fourth year, we allow them to enter any one of our professional schools and con- 
tinue half work in the literary department. Having planned their course in 
advance, they have always elected some studies—the law students, constitutional 
history; the medical students, biology and chemistry—which either form a part 
of the professional course or are closely allied to it. Thus they are able with- 
out overwork or cramming to complete the college course and the first year’s 
~ course in the law school or the medical school. This plan, which has been fol- 
lowed several years, has worked on the whole satisfactorily. Ofcourse, it could 
be followed only by a university which has upon the same grounds its collegiate 
and its professional departments.” 
But President Angell doubts the expediency of the reduction of the college 
course from four to three years by the University of Michigan on account of the 
effect it would have.upon the standard of education in the West.. In this con- 
nection he says: ‘‘ Without assuming too much for ourselves, wecan hardly doubt 
that if we made the proposed change our example would compel the smaller col- 
leges in this region and probably tend to bring all State universities in the West 
to make the change also. One who is familiar with the range of work now gen- 
erally done in the Western colleges and universities can hardly think that it 
would be beneficial to the West to reduce the standard of graduation by a year’s 
study, at least until the requirements for admission are considerably raised.” 
PRESIDENT HYDE OF BOWDOIN. 
The November (1891) number of the Educational Review contains an article 
entitled The Policy of the Small College, which was contributed by Rey. William 
De Witt Hyde, D. D, president of Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Me. This article 
coming from a man who is himself at the head of one of the smaller colleges is 
so suggestive that extracts therefrom are here reproduced. He begins his ar- 
ticle as follows : 
“Now that we have the germs, more or less developed, of eight or ten uniyer- 
sities, the college must prepare to take second place in our educational system. 
To ape the university and try to spread over the whole field of higher education, 
or to be jealous of the university and set up as its rival, is equally absurd and 
suicidal. Its proper policy is to.accept with modesty and self-respect its new 
position, and by losing the old life of self-sufficient independence to find the 
new life of membership in the highly differentiated educational organism of 
which the kindergartens are the feet and the university is the head. 
‘*There are three classes of educated persons: First, those whose knowledge 
of reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, modern history, descrip- 
_ tive science, and their native language and literature enables them to do ordi- 
nary business, to enter good society, and to enjoy periodical and popular litera- 
ture. Second, those whose knowledge of ancient and modern languages and 
literatures, higher mathematics, experimental-science, political and economic 
history, psychology, ethics, and sociology enables them to grasp the principles — 
     
-P-A-G-E-217
     
  LENGTH OF COLLEGE CURRICULUM. 809 
of medicine, or law, or politics, or theology; to guide social progress and form 
public opinion; to enjoy the companionship of wise and good men of all lands 
and ages; and to apprecia‘e the results in some department of scientific inves- 
tigation or historical research. Third, those whose special training qualifies 
    them to discover and interpret new truth within some chosen field of knowledge. — 
‘“To make scholars of the first class is the business of the school; to make 
scholars of the second class, and to discover and encourage those capable of 
entering the third class, is the business of the college; to train the chosen few 
who constitute the third class into full possession of productive powers is the 
business of the university.” 
The requirements for admission and the course of study to be maintained by 
the college are then discussed. He proceeds to show wherein the requirements — 
for admission ought to be modified in order to bring the secondary schools and 
colleges into close connection. On this subject he says: 
“The change is destined to become universal in the near future. As soon as 
the high schools are able to teach experimental science, French, and German 
as well as they now teach Greek and Latin, it will be the policy of the college 
to require for admission mathematics and English as at present; ability to read 
easy prose at sight in Latin, and either Greek, French, or German, and evidence 
of a thorough course in experimental science. We shall then have a consider- 
able number of students fitting for college in the high schools, who will be for 
the most part in the same classes with the students who are not intending to 
enter college, instead of the small number who pursue a separate course, and 
thus receive an undue amount of the time of the teacher and an unjust propor- 
tion of the public school fund. ys 
“This modification in requirement will necessitate some corresponding modi- 
fications in the course of study. It will be necessary to offer an elementary — 
course in Greek, as well as in German and French, for those who wish to begin 
this study after admission to college. There should be a course in the history, 
literature, mythology, and archzeology of Greece required of every student who 
has not studied the Greek language as a part of his preparatory or college 
course. 4 ; x 
“The multiplication of highly specialized electives is not the province of the 
college. The expense is too great, and the profit to students at this stage too i : small. 
“There are two fundamental lines of scholarly interest and two corresponding 
' types of mind, the literary and the scientific. 
“The college should, by its required courses, insure to every student an ac- 
quaintance with the first principles in both these fundamental lines of study. 
The college may wisely require of its candidates for a degree, ability to read 
both French and German, to writ2 correct English, the elements of political and 
economic science, psychology, and ethics on the side of the literature and life 
of man, and higher algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, and the elements of 
‘chemistry, physics, and biology, on the side of mathematics and physical sci- 
ence. 
‘For the remaining half of the course sufficient. electives should be offered to 
allow concentration on either literary or scientific studies, according to the taste _ 
-and interest of the individual student. 
‘*Such a readjustment of the conditions of admission and the course of study, 
together with improved methods of teaching in the lower schools, will allow 
pupils to enter college a year or two earlier than at present. No shortening of’ 
thg course will be necessary. The difference between the best academies and 
high schools and those of inferior grade will express itself by the increased 
number of students who will enter college a year in advance. 
“A, B. should be the ordinary college degree, and it should be given without 
reference to the precise nature of the course pursued. The degree means sim- 
ply that the recipient is a liberally educated man. Attempts to discriminate . 
between the educational value of courses of equal length and thoroughness in 
the same institution of liberal learning are relics of an educational superstition 
from which it is high time to emancipate ourselves. 
‘In order to encourage continued study during the year immediately follow- 
ing graduation the college is justified in granting the degree of A. M. to grad-_ 
uates who give evidence of having done the equivalent of a year’s graduate | 
study. Beyond this the college has no right to go. It owes to its undergradu- 
ates the full expenditure of its income and the full time of its professors, and 
if it attempts to divide its strength between graduates and undergraduates it — 
does an injustice to both. It is the duty of the small college to drive away grad-

    -uates who desire a prolonged courss of systematic instruction to larger institu- 
tions, which make graduate instruction their main concern. 
_ ‘The degree of PH. D. no mere college has a right to confer, and the confer- 
ring of this degree by institutions which make no adequate provision for grad- 
_ uate instruction is the gravest breach of educational propriety.” 
  PRESIDENT CAPEN, OF TUFTS COLLEGE. 
The purpose of the Office being to present this subject impartially, the most 
strenuous objections that have been advanced to a change in the college course 
are here presented. The first of these is from President Capen, of Tufts Col- 
lege, who protests most vigorously against any reduction in the requirements 
for the degree. - 
_ In the course of hisremarks on the subject he says: ‘‘ Of course, if knowledge 
be substituted for discipline and culture; if the cramming process takes the place 
of those calm and thoughtful methods by which the intellect of man finds its 
‘most complete development, it is possiblé that many young men might cover the 
ground embraced by the college curriculum in three years. But if the attain- 
ment of the bachelor’s degree is to be putwithin the reach of the majority of 
undergraduates in the shorter time by diminishing the courses of study now re- 
_ garded as essential to it, few persons who have given attention to the subject 
~ will fail to esteem it as a lowering of the standard of general education.” ! 
He does not agree with those who say that 27 is too advanced an age foraman 
-  tocommence the practice of medicine. In connection with this hesays : ‘‘It may 
_ well be asked who wants a stripling by the bedside of those whose lives are 
most precious to him?” 
He also says that if the age of college Sraduates has been increasing in recent 
years it is due to the increase in the requirements for admission, and the remedy 
would be either to abridge these requirements or to soimprove the facilities for sec- 
ondary education that men may be brought to college at an earlierage. ‘‘ For,” 
says he, “‘ifa youth has but seven years to give to study from the time he en- 
ters the secondary school until he receives the degree of bachelor of arts it is 
_ better that hespend three yearsin the fitting school and four years in the col- 
lege than four years in the fitting school and only three years in the college.” 
PRESIDENT WARREN, OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY. 
One of the leaders of the opposition in this matter is President Warren, of 
Boston University, who has done his utmost to arouse popular disapproval to 
_ the proposalsof Harvard. His remarks have been given great publicity through 
_ themedium of the public press, so that but fragments thereof will be here pre- 
sented. In an open letter to one of the overseers of Harvard University he says: 
“The scheme which I thought to propose is this: That every American classical 
college retain its present four-years’ course, and simply notify all students of 
their successful completion of the junior year by conferring upon them at that 
point the title A. B. (Harv.), reserving the proper and legitimate a. B. as now 
_ __ for those who complete the entire course. This ought to satisfy Harvard, since 
_ it would greatly multiply the representatives of her ideas and standards, while, 
on the other hand, it would permit the other colleges to go on as usual, protect- . 
. ing and promoting the interests of liberal education, properly so called. This 
happy compromise seems to me so just and conservative of all interests that I 
take great pleasure in presenting it for your consideration and for the considera- 
tion of your distinguished colleagues.” 
Again, on October 31, 1890, the Boston Post contained a communication from 
Dr. Warren, from which the following is taken : 
As eritical action is to be taken within a few days by the last of the govern- 
ing boards of Harvard University, it may serve a useful purpose to set before 
the interested public a few pertinent facts and suggestions. = 
‘First. The new measure now pending at. Harvard makes no provision what- 
ever for a compensative increase of the present requirements for admission to the 
freshman class. 
Second. The college is not understood to claim that its present requirements 
for admission are more exacting than those of any first-class American college. 
In fact, in. consequence of their flexibility and of the provision for maxima and 
' minima many a student now enters Harvard College who can not pass the en- # 
  1Annual report of the president of Tufts College for 1889-90. 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
    
    see = 
LENGTH OF COLLEGE CURRICULUM. : 811 
trance examinations at Yale, Brown, Amherst, MESSE, and similar colleges. — 
Few people seem to be aware of this ‘fact. 
“Third. The new movement aims to cut down ihe requirements for the A. B, 
degree to such a point that any apt and industrious student can acquire the de- 
gree of A. B. inthree years. In point of fact, an exceptionally brilliant student, — 
taking as many hours per week as some of the more hard-working frequently 
ae could finish the proposed sixteen courses and win the degree in two and a 
alf years. 
» Fourth. So far as yet appears, no effort is to be made to limit the present 
range of election allowed to the student, so that the A. B. degree on the new 
terms, as on those now in force, may be taken by persons whose entire under- 
graduate course is spent in Harvard, and yet who have never studied Latin, of 
Greek, or French, or German, or mathematics, or history, or philosophy, a dine 
gle day in Harvard College. 
“Witth. The new proposal, if adopted, will make the Harvard A. B. the least 
significant and least valuable in New England. There is even danger lest the 
‘a. B. (Hary.)’ become a byword. 
‘Sixth. No body of American students has ever asked for such a cheapening 
of the degree. Even at Cambridge the students are reported to have voted 
against it. 
“Seventh. The Harvard alumni haye never asked for the change, and many 
have expressed themselves in terms of the strongest opposition to it. 
“Fighth. Still less have the American colleges, or any class of them, or any 
association representing them, asked for such a surrender as the proposals of 
the Harvard faculty contemplate. On the contrary, the authorities of every 
college in New England, if not in the United States, deprecate the movementas 
fraught aie: and far-reaching evils in all the colleges, Harvard included. 
“Ninth. The fitting schools have not desired the change. On the contrary, | 
nearly all yet heard from deplore even the discussion of so demoralizing a Props 
osition. 
‘Tenth. Massachusetts, which has ever felt.a special ownership and. pride i in. 
Harvard College, has required no such action as that proposed. Had the legis- 
lature, five years ago, required it, how furious a storm of indignant opposition 
and expostulation would have raged from one end of the land to the other! 
Courts would have been appealed to, constituencies instructed, new legislators 
elected, to frustrate so pernicious a measure. Yet, quod non “Fecerunt barbari, 
fecerunt barbarint. What the Philistinian ‘‘rural members” did not do, that the ~ 
faculty and corporation of Harvard are doing their best to accomplish. 
‘*Eleventh. No ecclesiastical or religious body has called for the innovation.    
All the religious bedies, even to those which are popularly supposed to care ¥ 
least for culture, seem stoutly to oppose so needless and harmful a capitulation. 
“Twelfth. The entire movement is self-originated in Harvard University, and 
herein, for the first time in all her noble history, Harvard appears before the 
American public and the world as the sole leader in a confessedly and disgrace- — 
fully downward and backward movement in liberal education. 
“On careful consideration of this matter, several questions suggest them- 
selyes—questions which the Harvard overseers and all custodians of the higher 
education should take time to investigate. For example, it has been jauntily 
assumed that the age of Harvard undergraduates is too high, and that the only 
problem is how to reduce it. Would it not be eminently appropriate for all con- 
cerned, first of all, to make a few inquiries like the following: 
“1, Is ita fact that the majority of the youth entering Harvard and other 
colleges are any too mature for that self-direction in study now expected of 2 
them ?. 
“2, Is ita fact that they are any too mature for that manly self- -government 
in conduct now expected of them ? 
‘*3. If younger would their power of sustained and accurate abstract thinking 
be sufficiently developed within the limits of their course to enable them 
thoroughly to master the fundamental, philosophical, ethical, and sociological 
sciences as now taught? 
“Tt has been assumed that the age of those entering our colleges is higher 
than it was fifteen years ago. Precisely the contrary is the truth in Boston — 
University, and it might be well for all concerned in the discussion to inquire: 
“4, Whether the age of the majority of students in college has not of late 
years steadily fallen in all or most of our classical colleges. 
“Tt has been assumed that the growthof the higher education in our country 
has not kept pace with the growth of population, and the short-weight degree 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
812 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
_ (which may also be spelled short-wait) has been represented as the only cure for 
the evil. As the first allegation does not accord with the results of my investi- 
gations, nor the second with my judgment, I venture to suggest two further 
questions: 
‘5, Whether the relative significance and power and growth of the higher 
education were ever as great in the United States as to-day. And 
‘*6, In case they are not, whether the best way to cure the evil would be to 
raise up a larger crop of superficial and one-sided smatterers chiefly interested 
in ebtaining the earliest possible chance for money-getting? 
- “Tt has been assumed that many of the students who now enter schools of med- 
icine would first have taken an A. B. course, had this required but three years 
instead of four. As in all my life I have never yet learned of one such student, 
it might be well to institute another inquiry and to ascertain— 
‘*7, Whether ten such students can be found in all the scores of medical schools 
in the United States taken together ? * 
“Tt has been assumed that the required attendance upon college four years 
makes the collegiate medical students far older on graduation than they ought 
to be. Inasmuch, however, as the statistics of the Harvard Medical School show 
that the noncollegiate members of the school are but seven months younger than 
the collegiate, it would be wise to inquire— 
‘8. Whether a four years’ course in liberal arts may not abundantly pay for 
“seven months’ delay in entering upon medical practice ? G 
. “Tt has been assumed that athree years’ course in arts would attractfar greater 
- numbers of young men than can be induced to take a four years’ course. Inas- 
much, however, as many of the best colleges of the country have for many years 
offered both three years’ and four years’ courses, under the same teachers and 
with degrees conferred by the same authorities, the three years’ course invaria- 
bly offering even greater privileges of election than the four years’ course, and 
still many times more students have always chosen the four years’ course than 
the three years’—it is certainly fitting to start another inquiry, namely: 
“9, Whether untested assumptions are to be made the basis of far-reaching 
a : and revolutionizing measures in educational administration ? 
“Tt has beenassumed that Harvard College, without consulting with any other 
colleges of the country, has the full right to cut down the A. B. course to three 
years. Might it not be well to discuss for a little— 
“10, Whether she has not an equal right, if it please her, to cut it down to 
two years, or to one, or to six months? 
‘*It has been assuned that if Harvard were to cut down her course, all the 
other classical colleges would do the same. In view hereof, might it not be well 
to ask— 
“11, Whether, in case they were to do so, it would be a good thing for Ameri- 
ean education—a thing for which, in history, Harvard Uhiversity would be 
pleased to take the responsibility? And Ps 
**J2, Whether, in case they were not to do so, it would be a good thing for 
Harvard College ? 
‘Tn closing, I may be permitted to say that Harvard College is the one insti- 
tution whose leadership the other colleges of the country will gladly accept and 
follow so long as she is true to her own illustrious traditions. If just now these 
other institutions break with her and revolt, it is because they can not recognize 
her inher strange newrdle. She isnot herself, Herface is set the wrong way. 
She is marching, not at the front forward, but at therear backward. The warmth 
of our remonstrance is simply an index of our habitual love and loyalty.” 
This letter was written a few days before the meeting of the Harvard board 
of overseers, at which meeting it was supposed that the. question of shortening 
the course would be decided, and it was undoubtedly intended to influence this 
decision. 
PRESIDENT ANDREWS, OF BROWN UNIVERSITY. 
The fifth annual meeting of the New England Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools was held at Boston, Mass., October 17 and 18, 1890. At 
this meeting President Andrews, of Brown University, delivered an address on 
‘Shall the college course of study for the bachelorship in arts be reduced ?” 
As a representative of one of the smaller institutions, it was to beexpected that 
he would uphold the negative side of the question, which he did in a very able 
manner. His address was discussed freely and brought forth the fact that the 
men at the head of some of the leading institutions for secondary instruction 
  -are greatly dissatisfied with the present state of our educational system. While ©
-P-A-G-E-221
    LENGTH OF COLLEGE CURRICULUM. ~ 813 
they did not definitely declare for the reduction of the course of study, they 
were emphatic in the expression of the opinion that something ought to be done’ — 
to make our system more elastic, ‘‘so that those who feel the need of starting in 
their life work assoon as possible, and are ready to put forth extra effort, would 
be encouraged to finish their course in three years rather than four.” 
During the discussion Mr. George L. Fox, rector of the Hopkins Grammar 
School, New Haven, Conn., said: ‘‘I am aware that this[completion of the course 
in three years] is often done at Harvard, but so far as I know, at other colleges, 
while in rare instances it may be done, there is not the disposition to encourage 
any sueh efforts. If such a possibility could be distinctly held out to men having 
a college course under consideration, some worthy men would be deterred from — 
the unwise step of entering the professional school without college training, as 
they do now.” ‘ 
Another objection to the proposed change was advanced by Prof. Tracy Peck, 
of Yale. In the course of his remarks, on the negative side of the question, 
he said: ‘‘1f there is a widespread call in the thoughtful part of the community 
for reducing the college course of liberal study to three years, I have not been 
able todiscover it. There certainly are many earnest young persons whom poy- 
erty or other circumstances prevents from pursuing a full or even any course of 
liberal study. Such cases appeal strongly to our sympathies, and most colleges 
provide for the support of the meritorious ; butno reduetion in the conditions of © 
time or other requirements can reach them all, and it would be unjust to the 
majority of students if their privileges were to be diminished because of the 
unfortunate few.” 
Exception may well be taken to that part of Prof. Peck’s remarks which 
relate to the curtailment of the privileges of the majority of the students. - Let 
us consider whether in fact these privileges would be diminished by the short- 
ening of the present college curriculum. It appears not, for the reason that the _ 2 
graduate department would still be at the command of such students as might 
wish to pursue still further those studies which comprise what is known as a 
liberal education, and their privileges would be at least as great as they are at 
. the present time. The shortening of the undergraduate course would fot by any, 
means carry with it the abridgment of any of the opportunities or facilities for 
advanced study now offered by our institutions of learning, but would very prob- 
ably be the means of inducing a larger number of young men to pursue such | 
studies, since they would be enabled to enter thereon one year earlier than at 
the pzesent time. 2 
Another objection to the proposed reduction is that it would mean the degra- 
dation of the A. B. degree. If this degree had a fixed meaning, or meant in one 
part of this country the same that it means in another part, this might perhaps 
stand as an objection; but we are sorry to say that such is not the case, and will 
not be so long as State legislatures continue to grant to institutions the power 
of conferging degrees without defining the requirements to be demanded there- 
for. Should this reduction be made by Harvard and other leading institutions, 
it is certain that even then the A. B. degree conferred by these institutions 
would still mean at least as much, if not more, than the A. B. given by a large 
number of institutions in the United States. i 
The full discussion which the subject has excited has the great advantage that _ 
those upon whom the final adjustment of the matter will devolve will act in full 
view of all tho difficulties to be met and of all possible means which experience — 
suggests for the solution of the problem. A

. ORGANIZATION. 
The organization and maintenance of departments for the prosecution of 
graduate or advanced study and research is of comparatively recent date. By 
this we do not mean that before the establishment of such departments graduate 
students did not remain in residence at the universities, for we find that in some 
cases such students remained in residence before special provision had been 
made for their instruction. An attempt is here made to trace the progress made 
by a few institutions in this direction. 
Yale College.—The catalogues of Yale College show that although graduate 
students were in residence as early as the year 1836-37, no mention was made of 
any provision for their instruction until the year 1844-45, when the catalogue — 
for that year contained the following: ‘‘ Instruction is also given by the profes- 
sors to resident graduates, provided a sufficient number present themselves to 
form a class.” A few years later the catalogue for 1847-48 announced the estab- 
lishment of anew department, in the following terms: 
“It has long been felt at Yale College to be important to furnish resident 
graduates and others with the opportunity of devoting themselves to special 
branches of study, either not provided for at present or not pursued as far as in- 
dividual students may desire. With the hope of accomplishing this object more 
fully and systematically, the corporation at their meeting in August, 1846, ap-» 
- pointed a committee to take this subject into consideration, and in accordance 
with the report of the committee, at their next meeting in August, 1847, estab- 
lished a new department called the department of philosophy and the arts. 
The branches intended to be embraced in this department are such in general 
as are not included under theology, law, and medicine; or more particularly 
mathematical science, physical science, and its application to the arts, meta- 
physics, philology, literature, and history. Instruction in this department may 
be given by professors not belonging to the other departments, by the academ- 
ical professors, and by such others as the president and fellows may approve. 
The instructors for the year, with the president, compose the faculty of the de- 
partment. ‘The instructions in the department are intended for graduates of 
this and other colleges, and for such other young men as are desirous of pur- 
suing special branches of study ; but it is necessary for all students in philology 
and mathematical science that they be thoroughly grounded in those studies.” 
The greater portion of the students enrolled in this department were not 
-graduates, but may perhaps properly be called special students, who wished to 
pursue studies not given in the regular academical department. A school of 
applied chemistry was made a part of the department from its organization. 
The catalogue for 1852-53 shows that a school of engineering had also been 
established, and that of the 55 students enrolledin the department during that 
year, 51 were connected either with the schoolof applied chemistry or the school 
of engineering. The same catalogue also contained the following respecting 
degrees: ‘‘The degree of bachelor of philosophy will be conferred by the presi- 
dent and fellows upon students in the department of philosophy and the arts, 
after being connected with the department for two years and passing a satisfac 
tory examination in three branches of study.” ee

      816 * EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. \ 
The catalogue of 1854-55 slfows that the chairs of chemistry and engineering 
received the name of Yale Scientific School some time during the year 1854, and 
that several new professors became connected with it. The following extract 
from The History of Yale College shows the development of the department from 
this time: 
~The ‘scientific school’ now enteregd upon a rapid career of extension. Mr. 
Joseph E. Sheffield began his remarkable series of gifts. The ‘school,’ in 
honor of its distinguished benefactor, was called in 1861 the ‘Sheffield Scientific 
School,’ and a large number of new professors were appointed. Thus the ‘sci- 
entific school’—a section of the department of philosophy and the arts—had 
now become one of the most flourishing and valuable branches of the college. 
Its origin was due to the effort which had been made, in 1846, to establish what 
was then called a ‘fourth department,’ the primary object of which was to pro- 
vide instruction for graduate students in all branches of knowledge. But till 
this time everything had been in a formative state. There had been all along 
a small body of graduates who went on with their studies in history, philology, 
and literature; there had been also graduates among the students in the scientific 
section of the ‘department,’ who pursued advanced studies under the instruction 
of the scientific professors ; but it was found by experience that the larger pro- 
‘portion of those who applied for admission to the Sheffield ,school had not re- 
ceived the proper preliminary education which would enable them to pursue the 
study of any of the higher branches of science to advantage. Accordingly, in 
1860, substantially what is the present organization of the school was decided 
upon ; the courses of instruction being adapted to the educational wants of those 
persons who resorted to it, and to the somewhat general public demand for what 
was beginning to be known as the ‘new education.’ A scheme requiring three 
years of study was planned after the methods followed in the academical depart- 
ment, characterized mainly by the omission of classical studies and the promi- 
nence given to scientific studies.” 
This new arrangement of the scientific section was undoubtedly the cause of 
the readjustment of the whole department, which occurred in 1872. According 
to this reorganization the department of philosophy and the arts was made to 
include the undergraduate academical department, the Sheffield scientific 
school, the school of fine arts, and the school for graduate instruction. This 
organization is still in force. Itwill thus be seen that a distinct school for grad- 
uate instruction was not organized until 1872. 
No. degree for advanced work seems to have been given by Yale prior to 
1860-61. In that year the catalogue contained the following: 
“Tt is required of candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy that they 
shall faithfully devote at least two years to a course of study selected from 
branches pursued in the department of philosophy’and the arts. The selec- 
tion may be made from the studies of either or both sections, but must belong 
to at least two distinct departments of learning. 
**All persons who have not previously.received a degree furnishing evidence 
of acquaintance with the Latin and Greek languages will be required, before 
presenting themselves for the final examination for the doctor’s degree, to pass 
a satisfactory examination in these languages, or in other studies (not included 
in their advanced course) which shall be accepted as an equivalent by the fac- 
ulty. 
department who, having complied with the conditions above stated, shall pass 
a satisfactory final examination, and present a thesis giving evidence of hig: 
attainment in the branches they have pursued.” 
The requirements in vogue at the present time require the student to have 
taken a bachelor’s degree, to haye a good knowledge of Latin, German, and 
French, and to have pursued for two years studies in the graduate department. 
Harvard University.—The history of graduate instruction in Harvard is ably 
set forth by James Mills Peirce, secretary of the academic council, in his report 
to President Eliot for the year 1879-80. In this report he says: 
“ As no report has heretofore proceeded from this (the graduate) department, 
it seems to be desirable that I should take the occasion to present a brief sketch 
of its history. The residence of graduates at the university for the purpose of - 
pursuing advanced studies is a practice probably as old as the college itself. 
‘Traces of it are to be found in the ancient recordsof the faculty, and it hasalways 
been felt that the presence of such persons, even when their connection with the 
university has been of the slightest kind, has had a tendency to heighten the 
serious scholarly feeling of the place. At the time of the foundation of the 
scientific school, under the administration of President Everett (1846-1849), one 
  “The degree of doctor of philosophy will be conferred on all members of the
-P-A-G-E-225
  GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS OF UNIVERSITIES.- 817 
of the main objects had in view was the provision of instruction suited to the 
wants of the most advanced students, and it will be remembered that, in the 
first organization of that school philological studics were represented in the 
faculty as well as the natural and practical sciences. In point of fact, the scien- 
tific school did, within the boundaries to which it was soon restricted, fulfill an 
important function in regard to higher work, and had a considerable influence 
in preparing the way for what is now the graduate department. Until the great 
extension of the elective system of the college ten years ago (1870), and the es- 
tablishment of the degrees of Ph. D. and S. D. somewhat later (1872), it was the 
only department of the university that offered the opportunity of obtaining a 
degree by the performance of special work of a high character in pure science. 
It was resorted to by college graduates and other advanced students who desired 
to make a real beginning of ascientific career. Its opportunities of study, under 
professors of rare eminence, not overburdened with undergraduate work, and 
eager to promote genuine scientific achievement, were exceptionally fine, though 
inadequately represented in any printed record, and the degree of the school 
soon attained a very high estimation. 
“The next step that was taken towards the provision of instruction for gradu- 
ates was the institution of the system of ‘university lectures’ during the 
administration of President Felton [1860-1862]. Early in 1863, under the presi- 
dency of Dr. Hill, these courses of lectures, having been practically discontinued, 
were resumed on a’plan of increased extent and efficiency ; and at the same time 
it was ordered by the corporation that ‘the president, with the professors in all 
departments of the university, be authorized to meet and associate themselves 
in one body for the consideration of itseducational interests, and for the arrange- 
ment of such courses of lectures as may be thought expedient for the benefit 6f 
members of the professional schools, graduates of this or other colleges, teach: 
of the public schools of the Commonwealth, and other persons.’”    
The university lectures do not seem tohave been very popular. In the sever... 
years from their establishment in 1863, seventy-four courses of lectures were 
delivered, of which number sixty-seven were upon scientific subjects. The 
seven exceptional courses were delivered before 1866. 
At the beginning of Dr. Eliot’s administration graduate instruction was placed 
upon a permanent and more efficient footing. In 1869 two courses of instruc= 
tion, one in philosophy and the other in modern literature, were opened to“‘grad- 
uates, teachers, and other competent persons (men and women).” Thirteen 
teachers took part in the twocourses, 7 in the first, and 6 inthe second. Twelve 
students were in attendance upon the courses, 4 of whom presented themselves 
for examination on the course in philosophy. In his report for 1871-72 Presi- 
dent Eliot says: ‘‘ The university lectures have now been tried for nine years. 
Although some temporary advantages and certain improvements have resulted 
from them, it must be confessed that they have distinctly failed as a scheme for 
giving advanced instruction in philosophy, history, and the humanities, and 
that.they have failed hopelessly and in an unexpectedly short time. They have 
not induced bachelors of arts of this university to remainin Cambridge for pur- 
poses of systematic study, and they have not attracted to the university ad- 
vanced students from other places. Advanced students want profound, contin- 
uous, and systematic teaching. The university lectures, taken together as a 
_ body of teaching, have been discursive, heterogeneous, and disconnected.” The 
  best results were obtained in 1869-70, when the courses in philosophy and mod- 
ern languages were given. Nevertheless, even these two long courses, given by 
a succession of five or six different teachers, lacked consecutiveness and unity of 
plan and method. ‘ 
In 1872 the corporation and board of overseers adopted a statute of which only 
asummarized statement can be given. ‘The scheme contemplates residence 
of one year for the masters’ [A. M.] degree, of two years for the degree of doc- 
tor of philosophy, and of three. years for the degree of doctor of science, exam- 
inations for all degrees, and the presentation of these by candidates for either 
doctorate.” This action of the university immediately attracted an increased 
number of students, as will be seen by a glance at the table on page 819. 
Princeion.—The catalogues of Princeton do not show the presence of graduate 
students at the institution prior to 1870-71, in which year there were 3 in 
attendance. In 1870 three fellowships were created, and the students re- 
ferred to were the holders of them. The conditions on which the fellowships 
were bestowed were such as to require the holders thereof to pursue advanced 
studies for at least one year. The number of fellowships was gradually in- 
creased, thus increasing the number of graduate students ; »butit may be well to 
remark that until the year 1877-78 no graduate students, excepting fellows, were

  in attendance at the college, although a few such students had been in attend-— 
ance at the scientifie school. In 18i7 Dr. McCosh made a report to the board of 
trustees on the course of study in Prineeton College. In this reporthe says : 
“In the last few years there have becn a few graduates receiving instruction 
from individual professors. The board of trustees has now sanctioned post- 
gradyate courses. They have been started this ycar experimentally, aid the 
trial has been success{ul beyond all expectation. 
“The aim of every college should be to secure a fair amount of scholarship 
_ from every student. No college can make all its students great scholars. But 
there is a certain proportion, say one in ten, or one in five, who as having the 
taste and the talent may be made so. This is to be done by postgraduate 
courses. We have at present no fewer than 42 graduates, mostly from the Col- 
lege of New Jersey, but a number from other universities in America and Great - 
Britain, attending classes in our col'ege, chiefly in phi-osophy and physics.” 
From that time the graduate courses of Princeton have been well attended. 
In 1890-91 graduate courses will be offered in the following subjects : Theoret- 
ical ethics, science and religion, Pluto and his philosophy, modern philosophy, 
history, Latin, pedagogies, Greek, architecture, archxology, English language, 
Sanskrit, Semitic languages, physics, higher mathematics, theoretical astron- 
omy, biclogy. 
Columbia College.—The graduate department of Columbia College was not 
organized until 1880, although graduate students were enrolled as early as 
1874-75. Here, as at Princeton, the first graduate students enrolled were in- 
duced to pursue advanced studies through the instrumentality of fellowships. 
The holders of these fellowships were not importuned to pursue studies in the 
college itself, but were encouraged to resort to foreign universities, and the only 
conditions imposed upon them was to report the character of their work peri- 
odically to the president. But cn the organization of the graduate department 
a new departure in this respect was made, which was the adoption of a plan for 
the appointment of fellows with tutorial duties. This scheme was first put into 
operation at the close of the school year 1883-84, and marks a considerable in- 
crease in the number of students in the graduate department. 
_ Nonresident courses,—In addition to the institutions that provide courses of 
study for resident graduates, there are a number of institutions that provide 
similar courses for nonresidents. Such courses were established as early as 1874, 
and are, asa rule, taken by large numbers ofstudents. Insuch ca es the students 
pursue their studies at home, and, after a satisfactory examination, the appro- 
priate degree is conferred upon them. At least one institution, the Illinois 
Wesleyan University, also offers a nonresident course of study for undergrad- 
uates, which leads to the degree of Ph. B. These courses are intended for per- 
sons whose circumstances and occupations are such that they would be unable 
to obtain a higher education if residence at an institution were insisted upon. In 
some cases where a demand arose for an opportunity to do advanced work for 
which credit would be given, nonresident courses were established in preference 
to resident.courses, because the time of the professors was so fully occupied with 
other duties that they could not give the time that would be demanded by res- 
ident graduates.    
GROWTH OF GRADUATE WORK IN EIGHTEEN YEARS. 
The growth of graduate work in American colleges and universities during 
the past twenty years has been remarkable, the number of students in graduate 
departmentsof such institutions having increased from 198 in 1871-72 to 1,998 in 
1889-80. This increase has been due, probably, to the greatly increased facilities 
which have lately been provided for the prosecution of advanced study and re- 
search in the older foundations and to the establishment of new institutions in 
- which advanced work is the.chief if not the only feature. Of the latter class the 
number is very small, Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore, Md., opened for in- 
struction in 1876, and Clark University, at Worcester, Mass., opened in 1889, being 
the only representatives. The larger part of the students of the former are 
registered in the graduate department; the latter admits such persons only as 
have already received their first degree or have otherwise prepared themselves 
to enter upon advanced study. 
The number of students in the graduate departments of colleges and universi- 
ties in the United States from 1871 to 1890 was as follows:

As will be seen from the above, the increase in numbers has been fairly reg- 
ular, especially during the last ten years. 
Statistics of graduates in individual institutions.—In order to show the increase 
in individual institutions, and the fluctuations caused in some of them by the 
establishment. of new institutions, the following table has been prepared. The 
statistics have, with few exceptions, been taken from the annual catalogu-s of 
the institutions concerned. In a few cases where catalogues were not available 
the statisties were taken from the annual reports of the Bureau: <s

Effect of the opening of Johns Hopkins University on other institutions.—From the 
foregoing table it would be inferred that the opening of Johns Hopkins Univer- _ 
sity caused a temporary diminution in the number oi graduate students in nearly 
all of the institutions presented. This should not, however, cause surprise to any 
one who is acquainted with the favorable conditions the new institution afforded 
for advanced study. At the time of its establishment few institutions in the 
United States could offer inducements in the form of fellowships. In this re- 
spect Johns Hopkins University had a decided advantage, as it possessed twenty 
fellowships available upon terms which naturally attracted the graduates of 
other institutions. The natural result in the course of time was that other uni- 
versities secured funds for the same purpose. Z 
The readiness with which the graduates from the graduate departments of 
the leading universities receive appointments to professorships in educational 
institutions has undoubtedly created a desire for advane d study among the young 
men. This fact, together with the multiplication of fellowships, has been an im- 
portant if not the chief cause of the increase of students in graduate departments. 
The number of fellowships has increased from 19 in 1872 to 172 in 1889-90.1

State residence of graduate students at three typical institutions.—In connection with thissubject of graduate students it may be interesting to know the sections of the country from which the different institutions recruit these advanced departments; 
for, the standing of aschool isshown not only by the number of students that flock 
to it, but also by its drawing power or the geographical extent of its influence. 
‘In order to give a fair representation of the drawing powers of three typical 
institutions, the annual catalogues of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard Uni- 
versity, and the University of Michigan for the four years 1886-87 to 1889-90, 
inclusive, have been carefully examined with the view of ascertaining the home . 
residences of the students in the graduate departments. In an investigation of 
this kind a fairer representation can be made by taking the statistics of a series 
of years than by taking the statistics of but one year. The result of the exam- 
ination indicated is as follows:

    : GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS OF UNIVERSITIES. 821 
This tabulation indicates that Johns Hopkins has a stronger drawing power 
than either Harvard or the University of Michigan. It is also noticeable that 
notwithstanding the fact that the North Atlantic Division has more institutions 
offering the advantages of well-equipped graduate departments than any of the 
other divisions, Johns Hopkins draws more students from this than from any 
other division excepting the South Atlantic in which itis situated. It is a well- 
known fact that institutions nearly always draw much the larger part of their 
students from the immediate locality in which they are situated. 
Taking the figures as given above, we find that while Johns Hopkins draws 55 
per-cent of its students from sections other than the division in which itis located, 
Harvard draws but 25 per cent,and the University of Michigan but 20 per cent from 
such sections. It will be observed further that the number of foreign students 
in attendance at Johns Hopkins exceeds the number in attendance at the other 
two institutions. 
Probable causes of the popularity of Johns Hopkins University.—The large number 
of students from the North Atlantic Division attending Johns Hopkins suggests 
that some department of this institution is superior to the corresponding de- 
partments of the institutions in that division. In order to arrive at some con- 
clusion with respect to this matter the catalogues of Johns Hopkins have been 
examined with particular reference to the students from New York and Massa- 
chusetts, with the following result: The 57 students from New York were 
distributed among the studies as follows: Chemistry, 12; pathology, 7; his- 
tory, 7; physics, 6; English, 5; biology, 4; astronomy, 4; mathematics, 3; 
Latin, 3; Romance languages, 3; geology, ‘1; histology, 1; and Semitic lan= 
guages, 1. The thirty-nine from Massachusetts were divided as follows:. His- 
tory, 9; biology, 6; chemistry, 5; Greek, 5; geology, 4; Germanic languagés, 
3; mathematics, 2; philosophy, 2; Assyriology, 1; English, 1; and Sanskrit, 1. 
It will thus be seen that the two departments of history and chemistry eae 
33, or about one-third, of all the students from the two States specified, and 
may very properly be said to be the most popular departments of the institu- 
tion. This statement is substantiated by the annual report of the president 
of Johns Hopkins, ingvhich it is shown that more students are entered for those 
departments than for any other. 
Probably, however, the true cause of the superior drawing power of this in- 
stitution is to be found in the manner of making appointments to the fellowships. 
While a large number of the Harvard fellowships are open only to Harvard 
graduates, all of the Johns Hopkins fellowships are open to graduates of any in- 
stitution. Thus, although the number of fellowships possessed by Harvard ex- 
ceeds the number possessed by Johns Hopkins, the chances of obtaining a fellow- 
ship at Johns Hopkins by a graduate of another institution are larger than at 
Harvard. 
It has been suggested that the place where a student received his first degree 
might have some influence in the selection of an institution for the prosecution 
of advanced study and research. In order to arrive at some conclusion with re- 
spect to this subject the catalogues for the past four years of the three institu- 
tions which have thus far been made the subjects of special study and investiga- 
tion were again examined. Before giving the results of this investigation it 
may be well to state that of the 243 students registered in the graduate depart- 
ment of the University of Michigan during that time but 133 were resident 
students, the remainder pursuing adyanced study ata distance. In this investi- 
gation the latter could not be included, as the catalogues do not give the desired 
information concerning these students. For the same reason 118 of the students 
at Johns Hopkins University who were attendants at single courses only could 
not be included. 
While the investigation was being made it was found that the institutions 
represented were so numerous that it was deemed impracticable to give the 
names of the institutions. It was then decided to give merely the State resi- 
dence of the students and the States in which they received their first degrees. 
So as to make the representation as simple and complete as possible the results 
have been incorporated in three separate tables, which are as follows:

1, DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION. 
By the term university extension is meant that movement by which higher 
education is provided for all classes of people who are unable to attend the uni- 
yersities where such instruction is imparted. The definition given by Prof. R. 
G. Moulton, A. M., one of the Cambridge University extension lecturers, is 
“University education for the whole nation, organized upon itine~ant lines.” 
He says that university education has nothing to do with universities, that is, 
hhas no necessary connection with universities, and in order tosupportthisstate- — 
ment he shows that one of the three great branches of the movement in England 
is not managed by a university, but by an association which simply goes to the” 
universities for lecturers just as one would go to a grocery store to provide for 
the household. He claims that university education must be defined in an-— 5 
tithesis to school education. School education is compulsory and administered 
under discipline, while university education is purely voluntary; school educa- 
tion is limited, while university education begins where school education ends, 
and is practically unlimited, as it may be kept up during a man’s whole life, 
“The essence of university education,” says Prof. Moulton, “is that it is 
education for adults; itis voluntary; it is unlimited in scope; unlimited in age; 
it applies to a man’s whole life. If that be the true view of university education 
you will see that it has no necessary connection with universities, but it is 
equally the interest of all adults who have a desire to take part in it.” 
The methods adopted by the different branches for the extension of university _ 
education in Europe do not differ very materially. The elements employed are 
lectures, class, syllabus, weekly exercises, examinations, and certificates. 
The lectures are open to everybody and the audience is expected to be as mis- 
eellaneous as the congregation of a church. But in every atidience there is 
expected to be a nucleus ofstudents. . By this is meant persons who wish to learn 
more than is brought out in thelectures. For such persons the syllabus which 
contains the lecturer’s own outline for the whole work of his course is provid-d. 
With the syllabus as a guide the student can employ the time between lectures 
very profitably in reading what is required. In addition to the outline of the 
course of lectures and references for reading, the syllabus contains a list of ques- 
tions, one set of which is to be answered weekly. This is known as the weekly 
exercise, but is widely different from our examinations. The exercises are to 
be written at home, and any and all assistance that the student can derive from 
books, papers, or any source whatsoever is allowed. The exercises are not in- 
tended to find out how much the student remembers, but simply to train him to - 
work for himself. 
The class is held on the day of the next lecture either before or after the lec- 
ture. It usually oceupies an hour, and during this time thestudents can ask any 
questions they desire. Very frequently the lecturer discusses points brought 
forth in some of the exercises, orrepeats some bright saying made bya student. — 
But it should be borne in mind that the exercises are treated as being confiden- 
tial, and it is the lecturer’s aim to see that the feelingsof no student are hurt in | 
the class. 
At the close of the course of lectures a final examination is held.. This is as 
written examination and is open to those only who have done the weekly exer- 
cises in a manner satisfactory to the lecturer. 
The granting of certificates depends equally upon the lecturer’s reports of the 
exercises throughout the term and the result of the final examination.

2. ORIGIN AND HISTORY. 
The term “university extension” seems to have become current in England as 
early as 1850, but the movement as it is now known was not started until more 
than twenty years thereafter. For a few years prior to the establishment of the 
university extension scheme, educational associations for mutual benefit had 
been formed in many of the towns in England, and university graduates had 
been engaged as lecturers. The associations thus established found the greatest 
difficulty in securing competent teachers, and therefore requested the University 
of Cambridge to supply them with lecturers and draw up a scheme of higher edu- 
‘eation suitable to the wants of the towns. ‘After careful consideration the uni- 
versity, in 1872, appointed a syndicate (or committee), and instructed them to 
inquire into the best methods of dealing with the subject, and afterward empow- 
ered them for a period of two years to try the experiment of holding courses of 
lectures and classes in a limited number of populous centers, and of testing the 
work by examinations. The result of the experiment proved satisfactory, and 
the syndicate were accordingly made permanent and invested with power to 
organize and superintend courses of lectures and classes in such populous cen- 
ters as the syndicate might approve, where the necessary funds should be guar- 
anteed from local sources.” The plan proved to be very successful, for we find 
that from 1873 to 1881 the Local Lectures Syndicate had conducted lectures in 
ove: sixty towns. In some of these places the scheme assumed a permanent form, 
either by association with some institution already established or by the erection 
of a college, while in others the syndicate was compelled to abandon the work, 
owing to a want of sufficient support. 
The unit adopted by Cambridge University is a three months’ course of lec- 
tures, ono lecture being delivered each week. Arrangements can not be made 
for less than the unit unless it is to introduce or start a movement in anew place. 
When this is desired, a lecture upon some interesting subject is given, during 
the delivery of which the university extension movement is fully explained and 
its advantages freely set forth. Generally the people are so well pleased with 
the lectures that they wish them to be continued,and wherever a number of 
people sufficient to pay the expenses of a course of lectures evince such’ desire, 
centers are established. The university undertakes the educational organiza- 
tion of the course, while the towns must provide the funds and undertake the 
local management. 
The university fee for athree months’ course of lectures is £45, while the local 
expenses for hall, lighting, etc., are about £20. This sum must be raised by the 
local committee, but the manner of raising it varies widely at different centers. 
In a few cases sums of money have been obtained from concerts, etc., with which 
the centers were endowed, thus making them in a certain sense permanent. 
Considerable care is taken in the formation of the local committees. These 
should be representative, and political or religious bias should be avoided. The 
committees should include teachers, artisans, ladies, and especially young peo- 
ple, who will be very useful to circulate information or sell tickets. 
In 1887 Cambridge University, in order to maintain a high educational stand- 
ard inits university extension movement, adopted what is known as the affilia- 
tion scheme. By this scheme students who attend a course of lectures prescribed 
by the university for a term of three years, and at the completion of which re- 
ceive a certificate, may at any time thereafter proceed to the university and ob- 
tain its degrees with two years’ residence instead of three,and are known as af- 
filiated students of Cambridge University. The following-named towns have 
adopted the Cambridge University affiliation scheme, viz, Derby, Exeter, Hull, 
Newcastle, Plymouth, Scarborough, and Sunderland. The course for affiliated 
students is as follows: 
1. Special series of ccurses.—This consists of six single courses, consecutive, 
thus extending over three years. They must be in the same group, but not neces- 
sarily on the same subject of the group. 
2. General series of courses.—This consists of two single courses in a group 
other than that in which he takes the special series. It need not be consecu- 
tive, and may be taken before, during, or after the three years of special series. 
3. Elementary examination on Latin and one other foreign language, Euclid, 
‘I-III, and algebra to quadratics. 
Another important factor in the movement for the extension of the influence 
aad teaching of the universities is what is known as the summer gathering. In-

vitations are extended to extension students to come to the universities for acer- - 
tain length of time during the summer months and make use of the extensive 
laboratories, museums, and libraries. Cambridge limits its invitation to those 
more earnest students who have obtained certificates during the courses of lec- 
tures in the winter, and desire to supplement their theoretical knowledge by 
practical work. The Cambridge summer classes appeal to the few, and their 
purpose is to add to the educational efficiency of the work. During August, 
1890, forty-one students attended the Cambridge summer classes. The morn- 
ings were devoted to practical classes in chemistry, physics, and geology (palee- 
ontology), while the afternoons were devoted to courses on Greek arts, architec- 
ture, early inscriptions, engraving, Egyptology, and single lectures on other 
subjects. 
eons idea of what has been accomplished by Cambridge University can be 
formed from an investigation of the following summary:

OXFORD UNIVERSITY EXTENSION LECTURES. 
The extension movement was taken up by Oxford University in 1878. The 
plan of forming cénters and the methods followed by Oxford are similar fo those 
used by Cambridge. One of the most important points in which the two differ 
is in the number of lectures constituting a course. As has been said before, the 
least number for which Cambridge will make an engagement is for a single course 
of twelve lectures, while Oxford maintains courses of from six to twelve lectures, 
but certificates are not issued for attendance at courses of less than twelve lectures. 
While the main point with Cambridge seems to bs to maintain a high educa- 
tional standard in the movement, it appears that Oxford does not lay much stress 
upon this point, but aims to extend the influence of the University as far as pos- 
sible. This difference between these two branches is very apparent even at the 
summer gatherings. We have seen how chary Cambridge is with her invita- 
tions, but not so with Oxford, which welcomes all who care to come, irrespective 
of particular educational qualifications and whether university extension stu- 
dents or not. The courses of lectures are of general interest, and designed to 
meet the most varied tastes.. The Oxford meeting touches the many and tends 
to extend more widely the influence of the university. The third meeting at 
Oxford, in August, 1890, was attended by 900 persons, just as many as attended.

The cost of the lectures ranges from £21 12s. for a course of six lectures to £54 
12s. for a course of twelve lectures. 3 
The number of towns in which local committees, acting in concert with Ox- 
ford University delegates, have been established is 132, and the number of stu- 
» dents attending extension courses in 1888-89 was 14,351 and in 1889-90 the num- 
ber was 17,904.

LONDON SOCIETY FOR THE EXTENSION OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING. 
      
        
    
    
      
      
   
   The London Society for the Extension of University Teaching, which was the 
_ first body to follow the lead of Cambridge, dates its foundation from a public 
meeting held at the Mansion House, June 10, 1875, at which the following reso- 
_ lution was adopted: 
“That the principle of the Cambridge University Extension Scheme be ap- 
: pps to London, and that the various educational institutions of the metropolis 
requested to cobperate in an endeavor so to apply it.” 
The principal educational institutions acceded to this request, and are repre- 
sented on the council of the society. Furthermore, the Universities of Oxford, 
_ Cambridge, and London appointed three members each. to form a universities’ 
~ joint board, to nominate lecturers and examiners, and undertake (in conjunction 
-with the council) the general supervision of the teaching, and thus give that 
university status to the work which the absence of a teaching university in Lon- ~ 
don rendered neccessary. The existence of this board has further secured for the 
London society the advantage of a wide choice of lectures and a close connection 
; with both the old universities. 
The first courses were given at permanent institutions, but the size of the 
audiences soon proved thistobeapoorplan. Special committees were appointed 
in the central and suburban districts, who arranged for courses of lectures in 
local lialls, which led immediately to a great improvement not only in the size 
- of the audience: es, but also in the character of the workdone. As the years passed 
_ by the difficulty of providing special courses of lectures for the most advanced 
students of the different cen .ers presented itself. This was partly met in 1288 
by the kindness of the Gresh: ee committee in placing at the disposal of the 
society the Lecture Theatre at Gresham College, where central couises for stu- 
dents from the various local centres were established. 
_ Another great difficulty seems to have been to obtain continuity in study. But 
this also has been remedied in a marked degree by the institution, recently, by 
ae Universities’ Board, of Sessional Certificates and Certificates of Continuous 
tudy. 
In Seca to show the progress of the work done by the London society and 
_ the favor with which it is meeting, the following tabular form is taken fromthe

IN SCOTLAND. 
It is said that as early as the year 1874 the university extension movement 
was started in Scotland. Several Dundee citizens formed a guaranty fund, and 
arranged for five courses of lectures to be delivered by professors of the Uni- 
versity of St. Andrews, three of the courses—chemistry, natural history, and 
- physiology—being of twenty lectures each. This work was carried on for two 
years, but was rendered unnecessary by the establishment of University College, 
mdee. 
The movement was again started in 1888, and is now under the direction and 
_ supervision of the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and St. Andrews. Although 
the work has been going on for but two years, the reports show that satisfactory 
progress has been made.

IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The University Extension movement, as it is knownin England, had no. exist- 
ence in the United States until 1887. The field of home study had, however, been 
occupied for some time by other educational agencies, which have,ina manner, 
paved the way for the adoption of the university extension movement. The ~ 
foremost of these agencies is what is known as the Chautauqua movement. — 
CHAUTAUQUA LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC CIRCLE. 
This movement originated in the brain of Bishop J. H. Vineent, D. D., more ~ 
than twenty years ago, and the first meeting was held in the summer of 1874 at 
Lake Chautauqua, New York, and was known as the Chautauqua Summer As- 
sembly. The purpose was first to bring together Sunday-school teachers for con- 
ferenceand for acourse of systematic instruction in biblical knowledge; and, see- 
ond, to eventvally include all learning, secular as well as sacred. S 
The plans were matured by Dr. Vincent during a return trip from Europe, and 
are stated as follows: : 
“Tt was to involve a course of reading and study covering the principal sub- 
jects of the college curriculum, but omitting of necessity its drill in languages 
and mathematics, giving to the English reader an outlook over the field of 
learning and some acquaintance with the masterpieces of literature, ancientand - 
modern, employing handbooks and compendiums for the mastery of outlines 
and appointing more extensive work to be read—a course which the individual 
could pursue alone, if necessary, yet adapted for associated study. It was suffi- 
ciently simple to invite masses and to lead them on without discouragement — 
from its difficulties or its extent, yet so thorough as not to be deemed super- 
ficial by the more learned. Above all, it was to bring the six secular days of 
the week into harmony of purpose with the Sabbath, not only by recognizing — 
the Bible as a department of its study, but more especially by having the entire ~ 
course penetrated with the spirit of reverence and faith.” ris 
The following statement of the methods of the Chautauqua Reading Circle 
-was given by Mr. George E. Vincent, of the Chautauqua Assembly, October 10, 
1889: 
“The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle was organized at Chautauqua, 
N. Y., in 1878. The central idea was to provide systematic and definite aid to 
earnest people who desire to pursue progressive courses of study. Large num- 
bers were at once enrolled,and the membership has steadily increased. Nearly 
150,000 people have been at different times members of the circle, and at any 
given time 50,000 are pursuing the course faithfully. It was the belief of the 
originators that thousands of people were ambitious to do systematic work, and 
needed only specific directions. The plan comprises a carefully selected course 
extending over four years, divided as follows;

A half dozen volumes approved by a council of six prominent men; a monthly 
magazine with supplemental readings, outlines of study, annotations, and other 
sourcesof aid; memoranda papers to be filled out either from memory or by ref- 
erence to authorities, not examinations, but as means of fixing facts in their 
proper relation, and as thorough reviews of the subjects taught. At the close 
of the course those who have, upon their honor, done all the required reading, 
and filled out the memoranda papers, are given certificates. not college degrees. 
- “The promoters of the Chautauqua Reading Circle have invariably held up the 
college as the highest standard, as unquestionably offering the best opportuni- 
ties for education. But at the same time they maintained that those who can 
not.attend college ought to be given every encouragement to educate themselves. 
_The.eagerness with which people have availed themselves of the definite and 
intelligent plans offered by the Chautauqua organization is positive proof that 
_ there is a widespread ambition among the people at large to do systematic intel- 
lectual work. It is a source of gratification to the original circle of the United 
States that a home reading club should have been organized in England avow- 
_ edly modeled on the Chautauqua system. 
“Asan outgrowth of the original plan, which provided only for individual 
study, readers in towns and cities have been drawn by a community of interest 
into organizations known as local circles. These clubs have proved of great 
value, not only in aiding members in their individual work, but in arousing an 
interest in intellectual things and in fostering a taste for better literature.”

secretary of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle;

Johns Hopkins University and university extension.—Dr. Herbert B. Adams, of 
Johns Hopkins University, in an article entitled University Extension in Amer- 
ica, says “ the first conscious attempts to introduce English university extension 
methods into this country were made in 1887 by individuals connected with the 
Johns Hopkins University.” In 1887-88 Dr. Kdward W. Bemis, a graduate of 
Johns Hopkins, gave a course of twelve lectures in one of the class rooms of the 
Buffalo (N. Y.) Library upon Economic Questions of the-Day. The average at- 
tendance at these lectures was 250, of which number more than 200 usually staid 
to hear the class discussion. 
In 1888-89 Mr. Edward C. Lunt, a graduate of Harvard University, gave a 
course of lectures at the Buffalo Library upon American Political History. The 
same year Dr. Bemis repeated his course on Economic Questions of the Day in 
Buoy Ohio, where he lectured two evenings in the week for a period of five 
weeks. 
The work in Baltimore, Md., is described by Dr. Adams as follows: ‘The first 
practical beginning was made with a class of young people, who met once in two 
weeks, throughout the winter of 1887-88, in the reading room of a beautiful 
modern church close by the Woman’s College. After an introductory talk upon

university extension by a Hopkins instructor the class was intrusted to a grad- 
uate student, Mr. Charles M. Andrews, now professor of history in Bryn Mawr 
College, who gave a series of instructive lectures, accompanied by class exer- 
cises, upon the History of the Nineteenth Century, with Mackenzie for a text- 
book on that subject. * * * 
“Following the young people’s course, the like of which is entirely practicable 
in any church society with a college man for class leader, came a codperative 
and peripatetic course of twelve lectures for workingmen on The Progress of 
Labor by twelve different men from the historical department of the Johns 
Hopkins University. These twelve apostles of extension methods swung around 
a circuit of three different industrial neighborhoods in Baltimore, each man re- 
peating his own lecture to three different audiences, * * * 
‘Every lecture was accompanied by a printed syllabus in the hands of the 
audience, and was followed by anoral examination and a class discussion. Every 
man lectured without other notes than those contained in his outline of topics. 
The courses were organized upon a business basis and not upon the theory of 
giving something for nothing. This codperative experiment in university 
extension work was, however, only moderately successful. Probably it was 
more useful to the lecturers than, to their hearers. It is the conviction of the 
writer that it is mistaken zeal for university men to attempt to lecture to work- 
ingmen, as such, or indeed to any class of people. University extension should 
be for citizens without regard to their occupation. 
‘“The most successful’ educational experiments by Johns Hopkins men have 
been in connection with teachers’ associations and Young Men’s Christian Asso- 
ciations in Baltimore and Washington. Under such auspices codperative and 
class courses in American history and economic and social science, with printed 
syllabuses, have been given before audiences varying from 150 to 1,000 appre- 
ciative hearers. Chautauqua circles in Baitimore have also been found intelli- 
gent and responsive to student lectures. Under the direction of Hopkins men 
a three-year’s graduate course of study in English history has been successfully 
carried on by more than 1,000 students, who had already finished the four years 
of required study in the Chautauqua literary and scientific circles. A very 
elaborate syllabus based on Green’s History of England and select volumes of 
the Epoch Series, has been the means of guiding this interesting work now in 
progress in all parts of the country. In connection with the Chautauqua Col- 
lege of Liberal Arts more detailed courses in ancient and modern history have 
been conducted in the same way, with monthly written examinations, the papers 
being in most cases set and read by Hopkins graduates, working under direction 
a‘ter the manner of Prof. W. R. Harper, of Yale University, president-elect of 
the new university at Chicago, who is the recognized leader in the recent 
higher educational work of Chautauqua.” 
University extension in Pennsylvania.—The following note, in reference to the 
starting of university extension in Pennsylvania, was furnished by George F. 
James, A. M., general secretary of the American Society for the Extension of 
University Teaching: 
‘There has been recently an interesting development in education in Penn- 
sylvania. Many of the leading educators of the State have become interested 
in the English plan of popular education known as university extension, and 
in February of this year a meeting was called by Provost William Pepper, of 
the University of Pennsylvania, for a discussion and explanation of the system. 
The scheme, as it was presented, met with universal favor. On further consulta- 
tion with men connected with the higher educational institutions of the State 
it was decided to form a society for the purpose of introducing and establishing 
university extensioninthiscountry. OnJune1[1890]the Philadelphia Society for 
the Extension of University Teaching was organized in that city with Provost 
William Pepper as president. A fund has been raised by subscription for the 
initial expenses of the society, and the secretary will be sent during the coming 
summer [1890]to England,where other influential members of the society will unite 
in a careful examination of the origin and development of university extension,. 
and a study of the best forms of general and local organization. An earnest 
effort will be made by the society to adapt this system to American conditions. 
It seems clear to those interested in the movement that it promises valuable 
results to American education along many lines. 
University and school extension.—The following extracts from the circular of the 
university and school extension for the year 1889-90 will give a fair idea of 
_the purposes of this movement: 
“The design of the university and school extension” is, in the words.of the 
circular announcing its purposes, ‘‘to supplement and tostrengthen the univer 
ED 90-——53    
-P-A-G-E-242
       ge PRE 
ity and the school system, to increase the culture and to promote the intérests 
of teachers as members of a profession, and ingeneral to advance the knowledge | 
of letters and of the arts and sciences. 
“The work is not, however, restricted to teachers; it is open to all persons of 
the required age. No one can expect, through the university and school exten- 
sion, to secure a university education ; but university graduates and others, 
ladies and gentlemen, will thus have an opportunity of continuing or of taking 
up each year some one or two studies under university guidance and récognition. 
‘The courses in university extension will be parallel to those of the universi- 
jes and, within the necessary limitations, of the high grade maintained in the 
yest universities. The work in school extension, which will be slower in devel- 
ment, will be in the subjects taught in schools. It will also include the meth- 
5 and the principles involved in teaching the respective subjects.”      
     
     
     
                  
    
   
    
     
    
      
     
   
       
   
    
    METHODS. 
“The features of the work are home study, class work, lectures, instruction _ 
by correspondence, lectures by correspondence, the library, public examinations,: 
“prizes, and certificates—various marks of honor for work of high grade, but no 
degrees.” 
“*Each registered member is entitled to one of the following syllabi, and may 
procure the others from the general secretary.” [There are twenty-five of these _ 
_ syllabi, laying out courses of study, preliminary and advanced, in literature, 
history, psychology, political science, French, German, mathematics, astronomy, | 
_ physical geography, geology, physics, chemistry, and philosophy of education, 
These are prepared by professors of Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and ~ 
by Superintendent Calkins.] 
    CLASSES. - 
- “Any person may form a society or a class to study any one of the prescribed 
courses. A class should consist of from three to twelve students. The best 
talent available should be secured to lead or to assist in the work. The general 
- secretary will assist in forming classes in New York, in Brooklyn, and in other 
places. A class can pay its registration fee and class instruction by charging 
5 members a small fee. 3 
‘The class meetings may not only be made the occasion for pleasant social 
_ and intellectual intercourse, but the exercise may be varied by readings, essays, + 
‘and discussions. It is suggested that small circulating libraries for the use of 
aclass may be formed by the gift or loan of one or more books by each member 
of the class. . 
“A student who has no associates with whom to form aclass should pursue 
his studies with the assistance of the correspondence courses. Registered mem- 
bers will, however, be advised as te the formation of classes.” 
CORRESPONDENCE. 
“Registered members desiring to join correspondence classes should com- 
municate with the general secretary. These classes will be formed only when 
a sufficient number of students express a desire for them. The correspondence 
will be under the personal direction of a university professor. Most of the pro- 
_ fessors in the university extension have consented to teach the correspondence 
classes in their respective studies. 
_. “Correspondence classes are suggested for each of the following topics: Greek, 
Latin, French, German (the language and literature of these languages for a 
four or five years’ course), English literature, psychology, political science, 
American and European history, physical geography, geology, chemistry, phys- 
ies, astronomy, algebra (atwo years’ course), geometry, trigonometry, physical 
_ training, the philosophy and history of education.” 
ee LECTURES. 
“The class and the lecture systems, as the work is developed, will be thor- 
oughly well organized. During the year 1889-90 there may be a few lectures in 
New York or Brooklyn. It is expected that members of the university and 
school extension will have the opportunity of attending, each year, short courses_ 
_ of lectures by university professors.”

  CHAPTER IX’ 
COMPARATIVE DIAGRAMS ILLUSTRATING THE STATIS- 
TICS OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION DURING THE DEC- 
ADE 1880-90, 
  
Before entering upon an exhibit of the statistics of professional training in 
the United States for 1889-90, with particular reference to the statistics of the 
nine preceding years and incidentally to those of France and Germany for the 
same period, the attention of the reader may with great propriety be called to 
certain facts too important to be lost sight of. 
Both in Germany and France education, higher and lower, since the beginning 
of the century has been in the hands of the State, and, as a result, the Govern- 
ment of France arid of the several German States may each demand statistical 
information and compel its stipendiary to furnish it. On the other hand the 
information annually obtained by this Bureau is due to the courtesy of its cor- 
- respondents who are under no other obligation to furnish their statistics to the 
Federal Government, or in many cases even to the government of the State in 
which they are located. From this it naturally follows that several delinquent cor- 
respondents will be found each year, though not infrequently as many as four 
blanks are sent out to such on as many occasions. When these delinquencies 
happen it is the custom to use the statistics furnished by the delinquent insti- 
tution the preceding year, indicating the fact by a footnote. When an institu- 
tion fails to report for two successive years itis taken outof the table unless 
there is evidence that it still exists. In the following diagrams if has been the 
object of the compiler to fill up such lacunz whenever it appears that the 
institution still exists or has, after a period, been restored to the table. 
A still more formidable difficulty, however, is presented by the dissimilarity of 
institutions which bear the name of college or university or normal school and the 
like, but beyond cautioning the reader in the matter it is advisable to leave the 
subject to a future occasion, though whatever can at present be attempted in 
this line is given in Chapter X, which deals with the curricula of the schools 
whose attendance is given in this.

      If a certain number of individuals have a common quality that may be repre- 
sented in numbersa statistical table may be formed. Butif thiscommon quality 
is expressed in a very general way, such as by the term ‘‘ medical students in — 
1889-90,” it will happen that students who are pursuing a three-years course of — 
medicine count for as much as those who are pursuing a four-years course, It 
is therefore quite as important. to know what and how the students in medicine 
for 1889-90 were taught as to know how many of them were taught in medical 
schools during that period. Hs 
In taking up inorder the several classes of professional schools, the requisites _ 
for admission to them will be considered first, then their curricula. Statistics — 
for the last ten years have been given in the preceding chapter, and those for _ 
the year 1889-90 will appear in full detail in the chapter which follows. ie 
  MEDICINE, 
  REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION. = 
If we begin by inquiring what was required of the applicant for matriculation 
in 1880--81, it is shown by an inspection of the announcements and catalogues — 
of about 80 medical schools that the situation was, in general terms, as fol- 
lows: 
Ten had examinations for admission covering several subjects and 14 em- 
ployed some slight tests of an-applicant’s fitness to study medicine. The sub- 
jects of examination were elementary physics in 8 schools, arithmetic in 7, ele- 
mentary Latin in 5, grammar in 4, geography in 4, algebra in 4, geometry in 
-3, and history in 2. Grammar and composition were determined usually from 
the papers submitted. The amount of physics required was generally a knowl- 
edge of Balfour Stewart’s Primer of Physics or its equivalent. The Latin re- 
quirements were varied, and were intended to show the familiarity of the appli- 
eant with declensions, conjugaticns, common words, and simple constructions, 
Algebra to quadratic equations and two books of geometry were usual require- 
ments in these branches. The Michigan College of Medicine allowed a substi- 
tution of either Greek, French, German, botany, or zodlogy in place of other 
studies mentioned above (except Latin). French, German, algebra, geometry, 
and botany were alternative subjects at Harvard Medical School, on one of which 
the candidate must be examined, Botany and chemistry, asfoundin the Science — 
Primers, were required by the Woman’s Medical College of the New York In- ~ 
firmary. College diplomas, degrees from scientific schools, graduation from 
acceptable high schools and academies, and licenses to teach public schools were 
among the proofs of a candidate's fitness which were accepted in lieu of exami- 
nation. Inthe Medical School of Missouri University all students before entering 
the senior class were required to pass a satisfactory examination on English gram- 
mar, rhetoric, history of the United States, and arithmetic through common — 
fractions. Si 
In examining the announcements of the requirements demanded of matriculates, 
in 1890 the reader is struck with the very frequent use of the expression _ 
“all the branches of a good English education,” to which is added in the ma- _ 
jority of cases ‘‘including mathematics, English composition, and elementary 
physics or natural philosophy.” The phraseology varies, however; sometimes it 
isa ‘fair English education;” in other connections it is the ‘‘common-school

    - 876 
branches.” In many other cases the requirements are “ proficiency in grammar, 
arithmetic, geography, history,” and even reading, writing, and spelling, and 
roficiency in ail these subjects may be taken as a definition of a ‘‘ good (or fair) 
mglish education.” Such an education ought to be given in the public schools, 
and thus it follows that the requirement of the great majority of the medical EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  schools of the country is a thorough common-school education. The entrance 
requirements of the medical schools of France are considerably higher, for in 
that country the matriculate must have obtained the degree of bachelor of let- 
ters and another degree, which is called bachelier és sciences restraint pour 
math¢ématiques, and the curriculum of the German gymnasium, which is pre- 
- paratory to a course of medical instruction, is quite as high and as thorough as 
_ that of the French Lycée. What the requirements in Great Britain are may 
be inferred from the special matriculation examination of the Bellevue Hospital 
School for those students who expect to present their diplomas for recognition 
in Great Britain. This examination embraces the following subjects: English 
language, including grammar and composition; arithmetic, including vulgar 
and decimal fractions; a'gebra, including simple equations; first two books of 
Euclid; Latin, translation and grammar, and one of the following subjects: 
Latin (first two books of Cesar), Greek (St.John’s Gospel), French (the first 
chapter of Télémaque or Charles XII), German (first part of Adler's Reader), 
natural philosophy, including mechanics, hydrostatics, and pneumatics (Peck’s 
Ganot’s, or packers Philosophy). 
There are some exceptions to the average requirements in the United States 
which call for attention. In severalinstances a familiarity with Latin grammar 
is demanded, though in four instances this familiarity may be obtained during 
the course of medical instruction. For admission to the department of medicine 
of Harvard University the requirements are that the applicant shall write an 
English composition of two hundred words and write English prose from dicta- 
tion, translate easy Latin prose, possess such a knowledge of physics as may be 
obtained from Balfour Stewart’s Elements, and elect one of the following sub- © 
jects: French, German, elements of algebra or of plane geometry, or botany. 
At the Yale Medical School the requirements, with the exception of the lan- 
guages, are about the same. In the case of the department of medicine of 
Michigan University stress is put upon a competent knowledge of zodlogy, and 
languages are not required, while in the case of the medical department of the 
University of Minnesota the examination embraces an English composition of 
two hundred words, Latin, French, German, or a Scandinavian language, an ex- 
amination in algebra, plane geometry, or botany, and inphysics. The College of 
Physicians and Surgeons in the City of New York (Columbia College) has an en- 
trance examination in which the Latin (Czesar or Sallust), algebra, and geometry 
are fully equal to the requirements in those branches demanded by the above- 
namedinstitutions. These schools are connected with our highest and wealthiest 
institutions of learning, and if they are unable to ask as much’as the depart- 
ments of arts, with which they are affiliated, how is it to be expected that non- 
university schools, wholly dependent. upon themselves for support, both moral 
and pecuniary, can ask as much ? 
In addition to the examination as to intellectual attainments a certificate as 
to moral character is required. 
_  Itis not to be supposed, however, that the attendance at these schools is made 
_ up for the most part of those who pass an examination which is ‘' satisfactory to 
the faculty” of the school; for that examination is only required when the can- 
didate can not present a diploma from a college, high school, or academy, nor- 
mal school, or, in some cases, a teacher’s certificate entitling him to teach ina 
public school of his State. 
The number of the matriculates who have obtained adegree in letters or science 
has been collected by this Bureau for anumber of years. Consulting thisrecord, 
which is by no means as perfect as it should be, the following facts are devel- 
oped: 
Tor the 96 institutions reporting to the Bureau in 1881, 42 returned 1,111 stu- 
dents having a degree in letters or science, and 3 report definitely that they had 
no scholar with a degree. In these 45 institutions there were 6,625 students. 
Thusinevery hundred students there were 17 who, it may be said, had been lib- 
erally educated. Ifthe other institutions (51) had reported specifically that they 
had no student who had received a degree in letters or science, the whole attend- 
ance asfaras reported to this Bureau (11,399) could be compared with the number 
“of students who were reported as having obtained a degree by the schools which 
answer the question definitely in the affirmative or negative and noerror occur.

If we assume, however, that these 51 institutions had no matriculate in attend- 
-ance having a degree in letters of science, then, to do jus.ice to the different 
parts of the country, comparison may take the following form:

In 1886-87, 60 schools reported the number of their matriculates that had re-

had no person thus distinguished among their students. In these 65schools there 
were 6,690 students, of whom 15 in every 100 had received a degree in letters 
and science. Taking the same individual schools as before, theshowing is as

    EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-00. 
- Finally let us consider the statistics of the year 1889-90. Oné hundredandten 
institutions have reported to this Bureau, 78 of which report definitely the num- _ 
ber of students having a degree in letters orscience or that they have no student 
possessing such a degree. In these 78 schools 15 per cent of the matriculates had 
obtained a degree before entering upon the study of medicine. The absolute 
_ figures are, 16 schools with no students enrolled who had obtained a literary or 
scientific degree, 62 schools with 1,382 students having a degree; total enrollment 
in the 78 schools, 9,389. Adding to the enrollment of the 78 schools the enroll- 
ment of the 32 which answer ‘‘ Don’t know,” ‘‘ No data,” ete., the total enroll- 
ment of the 110 schools reporting is13,793. Comparing the enrollment in these 
110schools with the number of matriculates reported by the 78 schools as having 
degrees, the result is that 10 per cent of the enrollment in the medical schools of 
the country were possessors of a degree in letters or science. Considering the 
States by sections and including only the 78 schools which report 15 per cent of 
their matriculates having a degree in letters or science, it is found that 18 per 
cent of the matriculates in the medical schools of the North Atlantic Division 
had a degree in letters or science, 13 per cent of the South Atlantic division, 18 
per cent of the South Central division (including Tulane University, estimated. 
_ at 25 per cent), 9 per cent of the North Central Division, and 9 per cent of the 
Western Division. These figures show a diminution for the schools of. the 
- North and an increase for those of the South. ¥

«@These figures are taken from the president's report for 1890. The medical department made 
no report on the blanks prepared for replies from such schools sent out by this Bureau. 
b Average per cent. 
From the foregoing statements it appears that there has been a slight reduc- 
tion in the number of matriculates (17 inevery 100 in 1881, 15 in 1890) at medical 
schools,who had received a degree in letters or science; while the statistics of 
the eleven departments of universities (where one would expect a large percent 
of the matriculates to have obtained degrees) show that there has been an in- 
crease of but 1 per cent in the matriculates who had obtained a degree in letters 
or science. indeed in the instance of the College of Physicians and Surgeons 
(the medical department of Columbia College) of New York City a decrease of 2 
per cent is shown when the per cent of enrollment for the decade 1870-1880 (37 
per cent) is compared with that for 1880-1890 (35 per cent) ; or comparing the per 
cent for the first half of the decade 1880-1890 with the second half,a reduction of 
over 3 per cent is shown. ¢ 
The question, then, is: Has there been no improvement in the scholarship of 
the matriculates at medical schools ? 
The first of several questions asked on the form of inquiry sent out at the close 
of the school year 1889-90 was ‘‘ Have you noticed during the last decade that _ 
the students of later years were in a scholastic sense better prepared to enter 
upon the study of medicine than those who preceded them?” Of the 86 “‘regu- 
lar” schools reporting, 75 answer the question, 67 in the affirmative and 8 in 
the negative. Of 7 ‘‘eclectic” schools only 1 answers ‘‘no.” Of 13 ‘‘ homeo- 
pathic ” schools, 12 answer yes, | fails to answér. = 
How are these facts to be reconciled? Statistics show that the number of 
matriculates having a degree is not increasing relatively to attendance (see 
     
-P-A-G-E-287
    i diagram 15, Chapter X), and yet the medical. schools are almost unanimous in. ve ee . CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 879 ‘ 
_ asserting that there has been an improvement in the scholarship of the matric- 
ulates. .Is this unanimous report as to advanced scholarship to be attributed 
to an increased attendance at the secondary schools of the country? Are more 
graduates of high schools matriculating at medical schools? If wecompare theat- 
tendance of secondary schools(exclusive of public high schools and departments of 
normal schools and of institutions forsuperior instruction) for 1880-81 with that. 
for 1888-89 we find that there has been an increase in the attendance of schools. 
for secondary instruction of 13 per cent. If we compare the attendance at the 
public high schools of one hundred and_thirty-two cities in 1880-81 with the 
attendance in the public high schools of those cities in 188788 an increase of 37° 
per cent isshown. Or, speculating upon the subjectfrom the still more general — 
standpointof population and considering that the public high-school is always-a _ 
feature of urban life, itmay b2 concluded that the increase of 7 per cent in urban 
population during the decade 1880-1890 has increased the high-sehool attendance 
of the country at large. 
Some confirmation of the idea that the improvement in the scholarship of ma- 
triculates at medical schools is due to high schools is found in the great: protest 
against secondary and collegiate education because it tends to overcrowd the’ 
learned professions, especially those of law and medicine. But a protest is en- 
tirely too insecure afoundation to build a theoryupon. What is necessary is in- 
formation as to the localities whence the matriculates at medical schools come, 
whether from towns and cities or from the rural districts, for public high schools 
with few exceptions are located in centers of Paes and rest on a system of — 
grades beneath them from which they are fed. The public high school of the —_ 
rural districts it should be said is, in many cases, the State normal school or 
agricultural college. ¢ : 
in examining the reports made to the Bureau some expressions arefound that. 
corroborate what has been suggested above._ A medical school of Califor- 
nia, in answering the question as to a better scholarship, answers, ‘“ Decidedly 
“so,” and adds: ‘‘18 had attended universities, academies, or colleges, 12 were 
graduates of high schools, 17 were graduates of State normal schools, or held — 
educational diplomas or first-grade certificates, and 40 passed examinations.” 
A southern school, in denying improvement, adds: ‘‘The common-school system 
has destroyed the private schools, and only an elementary education ¢an be had_ 
outside.” (There isno normal school in thiscorrespondent’s State.) The medical — 
department of a celebrated university of the Northwest replies: ‘ Our students 
average far better now than formerly, as nearly all who enter now [who are not 
possessors of a degree] are graduates of high schools; while one of the fore- 
most universities of the Southwest reports in the affirmative, adding, ‘‘many o- 
our matriculates being graduates of high schools or universities.” A college of 
Ohio. makes a very striking answer in saying: ‘“ Yes, as to students who entef _ 
under 25 years of age: no, as to those over 25 years; ” and a Southern collegr — 
answers: ‘‘I have noticed an improvement in this respect, but it must be rememe ~ 
bered that the students from the South now seeking admission to our colleges 
received their education (literary) during the decade following the war when 
educational matters were chaotic.” chee 
Of 110 schools, 88 answer the question: “‘ Has the average age of matriculates 
advanced?” ‘T'wo-thirds of these answers are no, and 10 of them say the aver-  — 
age has diminished. The Hospital-College of Medicine (Central University) re- 
ports the age of seniors in 1880 as 26, in 1885.as 28, and in 1890 as 27. One college 
reports ‘“‘age diminished; mental caliber advanced.” ~ 
         
      
    
  
THE CURRICULUM. 
THE CHARACTER OF THE CHANGE IN THE COURSE DURING THE DECADE’ AS REPORTED BY THE: DEANS OF THE SEVERAL SCHOOLS. 
In reply to a general question as to the character of the changes during thede- 
cade in the medical curriculum, especially in regard to practical instruction, one- 
. fourth of the schoolsanswer ‘‘no change,” or ignore the question. The general 
tenor of the affirmative responses may be classified under two heads, to wit, in- 
crease of the time devoted to the study of medicine, and increase in the time de- 
voted tolaboratory.and chemical instruction. Theanswersas tothe timedevoted 
to study may be classed under two heads, one class of answers showing avery de- 
cided movement to increase the course from two to three yearsand tograde it, and 
the other a tendency to prolong the session from five or six to eight months.

istry and histology being the subjects most frequently mentioned. Clinical in-

struction also appears to be a subject in which improvement has been made. 
Entrance examinations, higher requirements for graduation, and recitations 
from text-books are only mentioned four or five times in each case. It is not to 
be supposed that all these subjects should occur to the gentlemen who answered 
the inquiry as they read the question on the blank. One thing would suggest 
itself to one and another to another. What appeared to each at the moment as 
most important was jotted down in the small space allowed for the answer. It 
is, therefore, surprising to find so many, though relatively few, answering the 
. question in the same way. 
With this preliminary view of the character of the advance during the decade, 
and a reference to the summary of the condition of medical instruction in 1881, 
let us attempt to ascertain its condition in 1890. 
‘The first question that naturally is asked is, ‘‘ Whatisconsidered to be a good 
preparation for admittance to practice medicine?” The regulations of the U. 
_§. Army require the candidate to pass in the following subjects: 
I. The physical examination will be rigid; and each candidate will, in addi- 
tion, be required to certify ‘‘that he labors under no mental or physical infir- 
mity, nor disability of any kind which can in any way interfere with the most 
efficient discharge of any duty which may be required.” 
Il. Oral and written examinations on subjects of preliminary education, general 
literature, and generalscience. The board will satisfy itself by examination that 
each candidate possesses a thorough knowledge of the branches taught in the com- 
mon schools, especially of English grammar, arithmetic, and the history and 
geography of the United States. Any candidate found deficient in these branches 
will not be examined further. The examination on general science will include 
chemistry and natural philosophy, and that on literature will embrace English 
literature, Latin, and history, ancient and modern. _ Candidates claiming pro- 
ficiency in other branches of knowledge, such as the higher mathematics, ancient 
and modern languages, etc., will be examined therein, and receive due credit 
or their special qualifications. 
II. Oral and written examinations on anatomy, physiology, surgery, practice 
of medicine. general pathology, obstetrics and diseases of women and children, 
medical jurisprudence and toxicology, materia medica, therapeutics, pharmacy, 
and practical sanitation. 
IV. Clinical examinations, medical and surgical, at a hospital, and the per- 
formance of surgical operations on the cadaver. 
_ Due credit will be given for hospital training, and practical experience in sur- 
gery, practice of medicine, and obstetrics. 
he Ulinois board of health, so well known by its activity ininvestigating the 
yalue of medical diplomas, has a schedule of minimum requirements of ten sub- 
jects—anatomy, physiology, chemistry, materia medica, and therapeutics, theory 
_ and practice of medicine, pathology, surgery, obstetrics, and gynecology, 
hygiene, and medical jurisprudence. 
But these curricula are a mere framework, so to speak, to be clothed with 
flesh according to the taste and conscientiousness of the instructors and ex- 
aminers. Nor is the order indicated in which these special studies should be 
Pernt, much less the reason why they should be pursued at all. If we turnto 
ance we may obtain some information on both these points. 
- It is well known that professional instruction in France has been remodeled 
during the last ten or twelve years. The reform began with the schools or fac- 
ulties of medicine, and in 1878 the following decree was issued by the minister 
of public instruction : 
“ARTICLE 1. The course of study leading to the degree of doctor of medicine 
lasts four years. Of this period the first three years may be spent in the‘ facul- 
» ties’ [i. e., schools taught by the faculty using that word in our sense] or in the 
schools of full exercise [%. e., schools taught by a corps of instructors who can 
not grant degrees], or in preparatory schools of medicine and pharmacy [i. ¢., 
those which only educate for aninferior grade of physician or pharmacist]. The 
studies of the fourth year can only be pursued in a faculty or a school of full ex- 
ercise. 2 
“ArT, 2. * * * The student undergoes five examinations and sustains a 
thesis. The second, third, and fifth examinations are divided into two parts. 
Examinations at the end of each year are suppressed. 
“Art. 3. The five examinations are as follows: First, physics, chemistry, 
medical natural history. Second, part 1: Anatomy and histology; part 2: Physi- 
ology. Third, part 1: Surgery, accouchements, operative medicine; part 2: 
Medicine (pathologie interne), general pathology.’ Fourth: Hygiene, medical

  jurisprudence, materia medica, and pharmacology. Fifth, part 1: Surgical and 
obstetrical clinics (clinique externe et obstétricale); part 2: Clinical medicine, 
practical evidence of work in pathological anatomy (clinique interne, épreuve 
pratique d’anatomie pathologique). 
Thesis: The candidate sustains this test upon a subject chosen by himself. 
“Arr, 4, The first examination comes off between the fourth inscription and 
the fifth [i.¢., after 12 or 15 months of study]; the first part of the second exam- 
ination between the tenth and twelfth inscriptions and second part between the 
twelfth and fourteenth inscriptions. The third examination can not be taken 
before the expiration of the sixteenth trimoathly period of study. Every can- 
cidate who shall not have passed the first examination by November at the 
latest shall be adjourned to the end of the year and can take no inscription dur- 
ing the course of that year. 
“ ArT. 5. Candidates for the doctor’s degree, the students of the schools of 
full exercise and the preparatory schools, are examined before the faculties at the 
‘limes stated in the preceding article; the first examination, however, may be 
taken, after the twelfth inscription. In such cases they must stand both parts 
of the second examination be‘ore taking the thirteenth inscription, but the stu- 
dent following this course is subject2d during each semester beginning with 
the second year of studies to interrogations the results of which are transmitted 
to the faculties that they may be considered in the final examination for the 
degree. 
“ART. 6, The inscriptions for the degree of officer of health (the lower medical 
grade) shall in no case be converted into an inscription for the doctor’s degree. 
This conversion, however, may be authorized in the case of officers of health 
who have practiced medicine during two years at least. 
“ART. 7. Practical work in the laboratory, dissection, and hospital attend- 
ance are obligatory. Each annual period of work in the laboratory, and in des- 
secting coversasemester. The hospital attendance (le stage prés des hospitaux) 
shall be two years at the least.” 
When satisfied that an attempt at reform is not merely a whim or the 
ignorance of the reformer, the intelligent inquirer immediately asks to know 
the grounds upon which the change is made. What then is the motive that 
has induced the French legislature to modify the law of 1803? M. Wurtz,! as a 
~member of the superior council of public instruction, gives several in reporting 
on the desirability of adopting the provision contained in the above decree. 
His remarks are in brief as follows : 
The old law of 1803 prescribed that an examination should be made at the end 
of each of the first three years of the course (without value in obtaining the de- 
gree however), and then five examinations more when the fourth and last year 
of study had been completed. In 1825 the examinations at the end of the year 
were abolished and the five final examinations distributed through the course 
of four years. But this was found to bring the examinations too near together 
and to cause the student to slight his studies (la scolarité était abrégée), inas- 
much as the most important examination (on clinical surgery and medicine and 
accouchements) was put off until the last year. This caused a new regulation 
in 1846, which, rejecting the examinations for the degree at the end of the whole 
‘course, instituted examinations at the close of each year. Although these an- 
nual examinations kept the student busy, thirty years of experience had shown 
their weakness as tesis of capacity and as a means of discipline. The object in 
drawing the above law was to divide the four years of study into periods, in 
such amanner that each period would be deyoted to several related subjects and 
could be closed with a test examination on those subjects. 
The question then became a purely pedagogic one. In what order should the 
periods follow each other? The degree of bachelier és lettres testified to the 
medical student's literary qualifications, and the modified degree of bachelier és 
sciences testified to his proficiency in the natural and physicalsciences. Should 
the student, possessing such intellectual maturity and such knowledge of those 
sciences which are the necessary introduction to the study of medicine, pro- 
ceed immediately to the study of anatomy and physiology, which are the foun- 
dation of med:cine? No, says M. Wurtz, the medical student must study phys- 
ics, chemistry, and natural history in a course that is neither a repetition nor 
even a development of his scientific studies in a lycée. The student is now to 
study these subjects as applied sciences, and to them he is to devote one year,

   But will one year fix these subjects indelibly, especially if the first examination 
isthe only oneuponthem? This was precaution the old programme had taken by 
keeping up the examination on physics and chemistry to the end of the course. 
But what followed? The first examination was frequently weak; the students 
_ were careless and the examiners indulgent; while towards the end of thecourse ~ 
_ it was intolerable for the student to take his mind from his proper professional 
work to rectify the neglect of the first year of his course. The new programme 
attempts to remedy this, says M. Wurtz. The applications of the sciences to 
physiology, to hygiene, and to pathology [subjects of the second and third ex- 
aminations] have now become so important, that it is easy to introduce in the 
programmes corresponding to the examinations many questions touching the 
application of pure science to the subjects of these examinations. 
To prevent crowding the programme of the examination—a fault of the old 
examination scheme—an innovation was made which is the distinguishing char- 
acteristic of the new one. The second, third, and fifth examinations are 
divided intotwo parts. In the middle of the third year of the course, and eight- 
een months after the first examination, the candidate undergees the first part of 
the second examination; at the close of the third year he undergoes the second 
part, after taking the twelfth inscription. In the second part of this second 
examination the chemistry of digestion, respiration, nutrition, composition of 
_ the blood, etc., is studied, as also the physical phenomena of hearing, seeing, 
and respiration as a source of heat, all very much specialized, it is true, but 
fruitful because of the solid foundation laid in the first year. The division of 
_ the two professional examinations, in the practical sense of the term—the third 
and fifth—was demanded by the faculties of medicine ; for it was thought that it 
was too much to ask that both parts of these examinations be taken in imme- 
diate succession. It was found that under the old scheme mediocre candidates 
would neglect one part of the examination and prepare for the others, counting 
- upon the benevolent intervention of an easily satisfied examiner and the indul- 
gence of the others. 
But there is another position from which the subject of teaching may be 
viewed. At.an early meeting of the French society for the study of subjects 
related to higher instruction the question ‘of what faculties should a univer- 
sity be composed” was formally put to the society by its president. Dr. Le Fort, 
of the celebrated faculty of medicine of Paris, on this occasion, after stating the 
views of his faculty as far as the matter related to the faculty of medicine, pro- 
ceeded to express his own, as follows: 
“The place to study medicine is in the hospital and only inthe hospital. Some 
medical savants devote themselves to laboratory study. Nothing can be better. 
But for the physician, who should above all things learn to care for and, if he 
ean, cure his patients, the only school is the hospital. There may be courses in 
hygiene and medical jurisprudence, but there can be no theoretical course in 
medicine; none in surgery ; there is only a course of clinics, and the professor at 
the same moment teaches the students the theory (of which they have obtained 
the principal notions from the books) and the practice.” 
Dr. Le Fort, speaking for himself and not for the faculty with which he is 
connected, may have been induced to speak so very practically in view of his 
opposition to bringing afaculty of medicine under the control of a contemplated. 
University Senate ;” but it can not be denied that public opinion is with him. 
His position seems to be, to judge from his remarks, that instruction in medicine 
consists of two operations—getting the principal notions out of the books a..Jd 
seeing practical work done and hearing it explained at the hospital. 
It is quite supposable, however, that the curriculum of a medical school has 
' the especial object to assist the student to obtain the principal notions from the 
_ books and to obtain them correctly. At all events, we shall assume that in 
America the original intention of the lecture cours? was to perform this service 
(generally imperfectly performed by the physician under whom a student has 
been placed), that by degrees, where possible, the hospital became the field for 
professional sight-seeing, and in many cases a good deal more, and that during 
the last decade the laboratory has been added to the instruction of the lecture- 
room and the clinic, as the biologist opened up a science of histology. 
In conducting the following inquiry,as tothe curriculum, then, three points 
will be considered. The manner in which the student obtains the “ principal 
notions” of medicine from the books, clinical instruction and dissecting, and 
laboratory work. The curriculum of the schools having a graded. course will 
be used as best adapted to the purpose in hand.

. TEXT-BOOK WORK, 
Beyond the ability to read the printed page, which may in a measure be a 
mere mechanical operation, certain intellectual attributes are requisite for get- 
ting the principal notions out of the books. In the first place (presupposing a 
logical arrangement of the text-book) it is highly advantageous for the student 
to have attained an intellectual maturity sufficient to enable him to understand 
the system on which the text-book writer has arranged his matter, and, in the’ 
second place, the mental alertness to recognize the parts of the arrangement 
and their relations as they are filled in, so that what is material may be given 
the study due to its importance and the lesser matters be noted as such. Per- 
. haps not less important in this process of getting the ideas of an author out of 
his book and into one’s own head is a cultivated perception.of the meaning of 
phrases and sufficient continuity of thought to carry a term, or phrase, or sen- 
tence inthe mind until the idea it contains as an isolated part of the discourse 
has been reduced to its proper value by the modifying phrases or sentences 
which generally accompany the principal part of a sentence or of a paragraph. 
Thus we see why in some quarters so much stress is laid on a thorough literary 
education as a preparation for the study of medicine. Even during the eighth 
decade of this century, when the theoretical or literary science of the class and 
_ lecture room had reached-its maximum and was soon to begin to give way to labora- 
tory instruction, the well known German evolutionist, Prof. Ernst Haeckel, could 
  say from his own experience that ‘‘in comparing graduates of classical colleges — 
(Gymnasien) and those of scientific colleges (Realgymnasien), I have always ob- 
served an intellectual superiority in the former, despite their defective knowl- 
edge, and have even found during the teaching of my own specialty, zodlogy, 
that the former enter more easily into the higher and more general problems 
of science than the latter. Iam, therefore,” he continues, ‘against the admis- 
sion of Realschul graduates to the medical schools (faculties), and I base this 
conclusion on my own experience.”* 
But since the distinguished professor wrote these words anew class of medical 
schools has arisen in America. At the beginning of the decade there were three 
or four courses of study whose object was to prepare the student for the study 
of medicine. The course covered two years, and waschemical and biological in. 
character. At Cornell the student intending to pursue a preparatory medical 
course was advised to secure a degree in'letters or science ; at Johns Hopkins the 
course led to the bachelor’s degree (A. B.). To-day we-find three or four times ~   
    as many such courses, as will be shown later on. In themeantime let us exam- 
ine into the manner in which the student (much the larger number) who has 
neither the experience of the preparatory school, or the ability to collect, digest, 
and formulate his knowledge given by higher literary education, is instructed by 
‘the American medical colleges. 
Until comparatively recently the method of didactic (i. e., nonclinic) instrue- 
tion, called repetitional, held almost undivided sway. The essence of this sys- 
tem of instruction is the well-known pedagogical—that is to say psychological— 
fact that repetition and attention are the most important elements in the acqui- 
sition of knowledge. The application of this not very obscure principle of peda- 
gogy to medical instruction was made this way : There were so many “‘ didactic” 
professors in the school. Each of these gave the same course of lectures every 
year. The student listened to them during his first year and again during his 
second year, and had he attended a third year he would have heard them for a 
third time. This system has been severely criticised during the ten years 
past. It has, especially of late, been rapidly giving place to the graded or pro- 
gressive course, which can not be finished ina single year by a well-prepared, 
intelligent, and laborious student, as at a celebrated southern university. But 
it is instructive to hear what may be said for the repetition principle by a de- 
partment of a large university of the northwest, which sought to retain the 
   
  1To the same effect Dr. Zarncke, professor of modern languages and literature, when dean 
of the faculty of philosophy of the University of Leipzig, says: “There is a second view, which Icall the pedagogic view. There is no better means of training the mind than the thinking 
and observing that the study of the classic languages necessitates. There is something mys- terious in this result, and still an experience of many years has confirmed it. Iam a member 
of two examining boards, one of which examines young men who have received their training 
in agymnasium on a classical basis, while the other young men are without this foundation. 
‘The latter are very often superior to the former in information (Kenntnissen), but when mental 
maturity is tested by written work the graduates of the gymnasium surpass those of other 
schools to such a degree thata comparison can scarcely be instituted.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
    BBAE EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. : 
repetition feature in conjunction with a progressive course ofthreeyears. This 
defense is as follows: 
._ The course of instruction consists of three collegiate years of nine months 
each. The work of the course issystematically arranged, and so graded that the 
-more elementary branches and the practical courses are first taken by the stu- 
dent, while the more advanced courses and theoretical subjects are presented 
later in the course, so as to secure, as far.as practicable, an orderly succession of 
studies; while the more fundamental subjects are presented a second time dur- 
ing the course, so as to secure a more perfect comprehension of their principles 
_ and relations, and to fix the facts more firmly in the mind. The hours of the re- 
quired lectures are so arranged that but few are given at the same time, and 
_ every facility is afforded for students to attend the repetition of the principal 
lectures as often as maybe thought profitable. The faculty recognize, what is 
- evident in the experience of all medical students, that attendance upon lectures 
_on the same subject a second time, after other related branches have been studied, 
is much more interesting and profitable than the first; and hence they require 
_ students to attend lectures on all the leading subjects more than once.” 
In the catalogue giving the reorganized course of four years, however, noth- 
ing is said of the repetitional features. 
But more particularly to facilitate the comprehension of the text-book matter 
_ andimpressthe principal notions which it contains,twomethods have been adopted 
in America in addition to the ‘‘ didactic” lecture. These are the recitation and 
the ‘“‘quiz,” neither of which are employed in the schools of university grade in 
Europe. Indeed,in America the lecture system may besaid to be gradually be- 
coming complementary to the text-book, just as in Europe the seminarium or 
conference is becoming supplementary to a course of lectures. Thus we are in- 
formed by the Yale Medical School that ‘‘in reorganizing the school asan integral 
part of Yale University in 1884, the inherent defects in the older and still com- 
mon method of instructing chiefly by didactic lectures were recognized and the 
methods now employed are similar to those in vogue in the other departments 
of the university. Didactic lectures are stillemployed as best in some branches, 
but recitations from assigned readings, with explanatory lec.ures, labo:atory 
work, and personal instruction in the clinics constitute the main portion of the 
curriculum.” At the Albany Medical College it is believed that instruction by 
recitation is as essential in medical as in literary colleges, and the faculty have 
greatly enlarged and extended this department of the teaching in this college. 
The recitations, which have hitherto been held during unoccupied hours in the 
evening, are now made part of the regular curriculum, Every study taught in 
the college by lectures is also made the subject of recitations, the ratio of the 
number of lectures to that of recitations being in general two to one. 
The Long Island College Hospital, having the old system of lecture courses, 
has adopted a reading and recitation term, which begins at the close of the reg- 
ular term and continues until June. It is designed té thoroughly prepare the 
student for attendance on the lectures of the ensuing regular term. Clinical in- 
_ struction for advanced students is continued during the reading and recitation 
term. As the laws of the State of New York require three years’ study of medi- 
cine, students are advised to commence their study at the beginning of the read- 
ing and recitation term. 
The daily and weekly quiz appears to be but a modification of the examina- 
tion at the end of the year or term without the breadth or formality of that an- 
cient contrivance for testing the memory of the student or his ability to grasp 
the idea expressed by the words in the examination paper before him. At the 
University of Virginia it has been found that ‘‘the daily oral examinations on 
the subject of the previous lecture are of great value in stimulating the student 
to regular and systematic habits of study. and furnishing the professor an oppor- 
tunity of discovering and removing the difficulties met with by the st ident.” 
At the Medical College of Alabama still stronger language is used in favor of 
these daily oral examinations, and it announces that ‘‘ so important is this method 
of impressing the leading facts considered in the lecture hour, and so useful is 
this method of instruction in obtaining systematic and accurate information con- 
sidered, that members of the faculty will, after the middle portion of the term is 
reached, establish a daily quiz, which will be so arranged as not to interfere wi h 
any lecture or other duty, and will be of great interest, especially to those who 
contemplate applying for graduation.” 
As medicine principally deals with diseased conditions of the human body in ~ 
an effort to restore it to health, it is not difficult to illustrate the lecture on anat- 
omy, physiology, surgery, and even the practice of medicine by demonstrations,

specimens, models, and charts, and in this way even the ‘‘ didactic” lecture has 
asemb!ance to the clinic. Without dwelling further on the subject of the di- 
dactic lecture, we now pass to the clinic, which must be treated with equal brevity. 
PRACTICAL WORK, 
In his Life of Macaulay, Trevelyan gives an extract from his uncle’s diary in 
which the historian gives the argument by which he dissuaded the Prince Con-~ 
sort from attempting to give the English universities a Continental form by in- 
troducing a faculty of medicine. Macaulay explained to the Prince the great 
difficulty there would be in getting distinguished physicians to exchange a 
princely revenue in London for the salary and retirement of a university profes- 
sor at Oxford or Cambridge. 
But there is another reason of still greater importance for locating a first-class 
school of medicine in a large city. ‘‘The workingman feeds the hospital, and 
to enable a faculty of medicine to exist a great industrial center is necessary." 
This sentiment is supported by the testimony of the Harvard Medical School, 
which says that it was established in Boston in order to secure those advantages 
for clinical instruction and for the study of practical anatomy which are found 
only in large cities. 
Practical instruction in medicine may be classed under two heads: There is, 
first, the nonpathological form,which goes by the name of dissection, and, second, 
the clinic, which may b2 subdivided into three forms, in one of which the subject 
is operated on in the amphitheater before the class ; in the second the class, or 
a portion of it, is taken to the bedside, and in the third the advanced student 
acts as a physician or as an assistant. 
The amount of work required in dissection is not uniform throughout the 
country and is still less uniformly stated. From 91 schools whose catalogues 
mention the work in dissection required for graduation, the following informa- 
tion has been obtained :

The modification of the didactic lecture by the previously ‘‘ assigned reading” 
by the Yale Medical School has been noted; it would appear that the method in 
vogue there for studying the framework of the human body is no less complete 
and systematic. This system of instruction in anatomy is as follows: 
“As in the other fundamental branches of medicine, the instruction in anat- 
omy is chiefly by means of recitations and laboratory work. The course extends 
. through two years, with examinations at the end of each year. At the begin- — 
ning of the course each student is provided with a box containing all parts of 
the skeleton for home study, and during the first term two weekly laboratory 
lectures are given on osteology and syndesmology, alternating with recitations _ 
from the text-book. After a thorough knowledge of the bones, ligaments, and 
muscular attachments has been obtained, the student enters upon laboratory 
work on the soft parts, in which eight hours weekly are required until the dis- 
section of all parts of the body has been made. Preparations of the different   
1Le Fort, at the meeting be the Parisian group of the Society for Higher Instruction in France: _

parts are made, showing. muscles, arteries, and nerves, satisfactory demonstra-— 
tions of which must be given before the professor at their completion, Prelim- 
inary to the dissection of the human body, a brief laboratory course is pursued 
in the anatomy of the cat. All laboratory work is under the immediate instruc- 
tion of the professor. The written examination at the close of the year is upon 
osteology, syndesmology, and the trunk viscera. The instruction the second 
year is by alternating lectures and recitations, and includes the remainder of 
systematic anatomy, with topographical and superficial anatomy, illustrated by 
preparations, models, and several hundred lantern slides.” _ 
At the University of Virginia the course in dissection appears to be carried 
out with equal thoroughness. ‘ For the course in practical anatomy, dissecting 
material, obtained under the permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied 
without cost to the student. Each medical student, however many sessions he 
may have attended, is required to dissect under the constant and careful super- 
vision of the demonstrator. Attendance in the dissecting room is compulsory, a 
strict record being kept in the case of each student. Besides the oral examina- 
tion which precedes each lecture, and the other examinations, each student is 
required to stand seven practical examinations, one upon osteology, four upon 
different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, and one on the ves- 
sels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being 
examined alone. They consist of the identification of the truths of anatomy on- 
the bones, the cadaver, and the dissected cadaver, and are thus a perfect test of - 
the student’s acquaintance with the gross structure of the human body.” 
As the attendance at neither of these schools is large as compared with the 
attendance at the schools of Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago, the follow- 
ing course of dissection may more nearly represent what the great schools can 
do and the average school does do. 
During each session every student of the first and second classes will be re- 
quired to dissect all regions of the human body. The first dissection of a region 
will be mainly of the nature of a preliminary study, the student being required 
to examine the attachments and relations of muscles and the general course and 
situation of the great vascular and nervous trunks. The second dissection of a 
region will be as exhaustive as it is practicable to make it, all the structures 
being as completely displayed as the time at the disposal of the student will al- 
low. The demonstrator of anatomy will examine the students from time to time 
during the progress of their dissections, and, if he finds that they have not prop- 
erly easplered the structures or have no accurate knowledge of the parts dis- 
sected, he will require a new dissection of the same region upon another subject. 
He will certify to the professor of anatomy the satisfactory completion of each 
dissection. It is recommended to students of the third class that they perform 
“upon the cadaver such surgical operations as may be practicable, such as liga- 
tions of arteries, amputations, etc. Material for this purpose will be furnished. 
Dissecting will commence October 15 and continue until the following March. 
_ The room will be open daily for students and the demonstrator or his assistants 
will be present. During the session there will be given special demonstrations 
of the brain, of the thoracic andthe abdominal viscera, and also of other diffieult 
or obscure regions of the body. The demonstrator and assistants will have gen- 
eral supervision and direction over all students while in the dissecting room. 
In two schools with very large attendance a rather novel course is pursued in 
aiding the student in his study of osteology. Instead of providing him with a 
complete skeleton, as at Yale, individual bones are loaned the student, as books 
“are loaned at libraries. At the Columbia College school this ‘‘ne'w and useful 
- feature” is transacted in the ‘‘ bone-room,” where alarge number of disarticulated 
skeletons are kept under an ostelogian,it is presumed. In the other school, the 
celebrated medical school of the University of Pennsylvania, the ‘‘ bone-room ” 
_is dignified by the technical term Osteo-syndesmological Laboratory. 
Upon the question of clinical instruction the medical fraternity agree: Clin- 
ical instruction is necessary to fit the student for the practice of his profession. 
Following out this conclusion, a class of hospitals has arisen which in the strict- 
est sense are clinical. In some cases hospitals have been aitached, as it were, 
to a college, as in the case of the medical department of the Tulane University 
of Louisiana and the School of Medicine of the University of Maryland. In ~ 
- others the hospital has founded a school, as in the case of the Bellevue Hospital 
Medical College and the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary, 
and in others the school has founded a hospital, as in the case of the University 
of Pennsylvania, of Michigan, and of Wooster; of the Jefferson Medical College 
and Medico Chirurgical College, both of Philadelphia; the Long Island College

  Hospital, and of the homeopathic medical colleges and. hospitals of New York and % : 
Philadelphia. As a general introduction to the programmes of clinical instruc- — 
tion which follow, the opinion held by the faculty of the Tulane University medi- 
cal department will be used as expressing the views of every reputable school, 
“Tt is universally admitted that, without abundant anatomical and clinical 
material, no medical school, however numerous or eloquent its professors, can 
possibly fit its pupils for practical professional life. It is scarcely necessary to ~ 
state that it is only in large cities that such advantages can be procured; but 
itis of paramount importance that the opportunities there afforded should be 
properly utilized; that the students should be required, under the direction of 
the teacher, to examine patients for themselves, to keep record of cases, to note _ 
daily changes which may gccur, and thus acquaint themselves by personal ob- 
servation with the progress and termination of diseases and accidents. The 
mere introduction of a patient into an amphitheater and the discussion-of his 
case by the professor in the presence of a large class are nosubstitute for bed- 
side instruction, and no reduction of lecture fees, not even their entire aboli- 
tion, can possibly compensate for the lack of such opportunities.” 
In the medical department of the University of the City of New York, avery — 
largely attended school, the graduating class is divided into sections of about 
twenty-five each, which receive separate instruction for one or two hours daily 
throughout the term. This instruction is under the immediate direction and 
managementof nine professors and is carried on partly in the wards of Bellevue 
Hospital and partly in the college building. The students receive practical 
instruction in operative surgery upon the cadaver, in the examination of med- 
ical and surgical cases for the purpose of diagnosis, in the application of dress- 
ings and apparatus, and in the use of the laryngoscope and ophthalmoscope. 
In the hospital, students are taken to the bedside of the patient and are exer- 
cised in making diagnosis under the direction ofthe instructor, and in dressing 
wounds, and are enabled to watch the progress of cases. In thedispensary they — 
have similar opportunities to become familiar with the methods of diagnosis, 
the treatment, and the course of those diseases which do not require confine-— 
ment in bed. “The success of this system of instruction;” says the faculty, 
‘Shas been very marked in the past, and it has given much satisfaction to both” 
students and teachers; it enables the students to become practically familiar 
with many of the things which they have learned from their text-books or in 
the lecture room, to cultivate their powers of observation, and to aid their 
memory. The importance which the faculty attaches to it is shown in the fact. 
that it involves an increase in the time given to instruction of more than twenty 
hours each week.” ‘ % 2 
To the same effect the School of Medicine of Columbia College speaks of the 
recent founding of the Vanderbilt Clinic and Sloane Maternity Hospital, as 
branches of the school, as being especially beneficial in enabling the school to 
organize a system of practical clinical teaching, whereby each member of nu- 
merous small classes may be brought into direct personal contact with the cases” 
under examination. This teaching takes the following form under the title of 
‘Practical Clinical Instruction :” 
General medicine.—Diagnosis, including so-called physical diagnosis, and treatment. 
General surgery.—Diagnosis and treatment, including minor surgery, bandaging, and the ap- 
plication of antiseptie dressings. 
Midwifery.—Attendance upon cases of labor at the Sloane Maternity Hospital by advanced students, under the direction of the obstetricians of the hospital. 
Gynecology.—Practical instruction in diagnosis and treatment, including the use of instru- 
ments. Fi 
Diseases of children.—Diagnosis and treatment. 
Diseases of the genito-urinary organs.—Diagnosis and treatment. 
Diseases of the nervous system.—Examination of cases, including electrical tests; diagnosis 
and localization of lesions; electro-therapeutics. - 
Diseases of the skin.—Diagnosis and treatment. 5 
Diseases of the eye.—Diagnosis, including the tests for errors of refraction and accommoda- 
tion, and the use of the ophthalmoscope, and treatment. 
Discasces of the ear.—Diagnosis and treatment. Z 
Diseas 8 of the throat,—Diagnosis and treatment, including the use of the laryngoscope and 
rhinoscope. 
At the Yale Medical School the instruction is given in the New Haven Hos- 
pital and at the college dispensary. . 
“Tn the medical clinics at the dispensary the preliminary examination is made- 
by a student, and this is reviewed and extended as far as necessary by the in- 
structor; the latter explains the relations of the symptoms, makes the diagnosis, 
and gives the student in charge general directions for treatment; the student, 
  subject to correction, gives the precise directions to the patient. Allsymptoms —

and physical signs are demonstrated.to all the members of the class, and exam- 
inations of urine, sputum, gastric contents, and blood are made, when called for, 
by the student, under the supervision of the instructors. It is the especial aim 
_ in these clinics to familiarize the student with all methods and instruments of 
diagnostic examination, and the instruction is made as personal as possible. 
_ Cases which need to seen at home are put in charge of the senior students, and 
obstetrical cases are assigned to them. In such cases the professor of clinical 
medicine or his assistants give counsel whenever called on. At the hospital 
- one medical clinic is held each week; these are general medical clinics, 
but particular attention is given to the demonstration of the various signs of 
importance in physical diagnosis. Opportunity is also here provided for the 
study of those severer cases which the dispensary service does not furnish, and 
care is taken to have the students see the same patient in various stages of his 
disease; and, in fatal cases, to demonstrate the lesions.” i 
The “ clinical out-practice,” referred to in the above quotation, illustrates the 
usage of other schoo!s. At the Jefferson Medical College the professor of prac- 
tice will, during his clinical term, devote a number of hours to clinical confer- 
‘ences. During these the advanced student will have a case assigned him, which 
he will be required, with the aid of the chief clinical assistant, to examine 
beforehand, and which then, with remarks on the diagnosis, prognosis, and 
_ treatment, he will present to the class. The Bennett Medical School, of Chi- 
cago, goes further. Students in the senior year, by assignment, will be given 
the care of out-patients from the clinic, thus giving the experience in actual 
bedside practice, in such cases as fevers, rheumatism, treatment after surgical 
_ operations, obstetrical cases, etc. 
But it is in the dispensary that this ‘‘out” instruction is most frequently 
given, At the Chicago Medical School of the Northwestern University, for in- 
stance, the members of the clinical class may serve as assistants to the physicians 
and surgeons of the several departments of the dispensary, and to the phar- 
macist of the dispensary, and receive certificates of such service. Members of 
_ the attending staff and the dispensary pharmacist appoint their own assistants, 
and the term of service is six weeks. At the Kansas City Medical College every 
+ member of the senior class served a period of two months in each of the depart- 
_ ments of the dispensary during the sessions of 1889-’90. 
To illustrate the order of clinical exercises, the following programmes are 
given:

  LABORATORY WORK, 
   | The most noteworthy innovation of the decade has not been the lengthening 
of the course of instruction, many years ago recognized as too short, not the 
better and completer organization of the clinic, which in a great part no longer 
renders the ‘study under a physician” indispensable, but the introduction of _ 
_ laboratory work in chemistry, physiology, and especially in normal and patho- 
logical histology or, more generally, biology. Perhaps the introduction of lab 
ratory work has playe a eres ee len; thening on course of medical instrue-
-P-A-G-E-299
    
"tion, as it certainly has given it status as a course in science. It is certainly so     4 CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 891-== 
in the case of the Medical School of the University of Michigan, for its faculty 
states explicitly that the extension of the course from three to four years ‘‘is 
largely due to the need for the more through instruction in laboratory work,” 
for the student who spends but “three years in attendance upon lectures and one 
year of study with a preceptor can not reap the advantage of the full course of 
laboratory instruction.” 5 
Laboratory instruction as’ given in the American colleges of medicine may, 
in view of the laboratories in which itis given, be classed under six heads, to wit: 
. Dissection or ‘‘ Practical Anatomy.” 
. Chemical manipulation (general and analytic). 
. Physiological. ei 
. Histological. 
a. Normal. 
b. Pathological. 
5, Bacteriological. 
6. Materia medica. 
Dissection hasalready been spoken of; normal histology will be spoken of fur- 
ther on; while other than noting that it affords each student the opportunity 
to go through a course of chemical experiments, the instruction of the chemical COO 
laboratory calls for nospecial mention exceptas to that form which at the Yale ~ . 
Medical School is called the course in physiological and medical chemistry. 
This course consists of recitations and a practical laboratory study of the com- 
position and reactions of the various animal tissues and fluids, the processes of 
metabolism and digestion, and the action of ferments. Due attention is paid to 
the composition of foods, the physiological use of the digestive preparations, and 
other matters of medical interest, especially to the recent analytical methods _ 
employed in clinical work. The study of normal urine is supplemented by — 
abundant practice in the chemical and microscopical examination of patholog- 
ieal specimens. At the Jefferson Medical College, the same tendency towards 
the pathological side is shown in the instruction in its laboratory of practical 
chemistry. The student there examines the normal and abnormal products of - 
the human body as aiding diagnosis, and studies practically the ‘‘ morbid 
chemistry of the bile and blood.” and the most approved methods of examining 
urine. At the University of Michigan there are two courses, one in.qualitative 
chemistry and the other in urinalysis as applied tochemical usesand physiolog- 
ical study; but, in addition to them and at the option of the student, two other 
courses are offered, one in physiological chemistry and the other in pathological 
chemistry. The first of these optional courses deals with the analysis of the 
solid and fluid parts of the body, the other embraces courses in qualitative and 
quantitative analysis and the examination of foods and of the tissues and fluids 
of poisoned animals. One might venture tocall this specialization of chemistry 
diagnostic chemistry. Toxocologic chemistry also appears as a department of 
the chemical laboratory, but sometimes is connected with medical jurisprodence. ~ 
The physiological laboratory, of which there are very few in the country, is 
to the medical school what the mechanical or testing laboratory is to the college 
of technology, and in some schools (which care to mention the fact) what the 
biological laboratory is to the vivisectionist. -The instruments with which such 
a laboratory is fitted up and the usé made of them may bo illustrated by the | 
laboratory of the Jefferson Medical College. The teaching of this college | 
in its course of experimental physiology embraces the demonstration of the 
essential phenomena of digestion, absorption, circulation, respiration, excretion, 
the functions of the nervous system, including the special senses, the reproductive 
apparatus, and development of the embryo. For these demonstrations, as well 
as for original research, the laboratory is equipped with the following apparatus. 
For the study of— 
Digestion and absorption.—Chemical appliances for the investigation of the 
properties of the albuminous bodies, the chemistry of the tissues, the composi- 
tion of the digestive fluids, blood, etc., instruments for making gastric and in- 
testinal fistulae, water baths, and dialysers, and apparatus for recording rate of 
secretion. : t   
1 This school, with great propriety, classes dissections as laboratory work, Other schools, 
seemingly with less propriety, also class the witnessing an autopsy as laboratory work, consid- 
ering it as a part of the work ofthe pathological laboratory. It would be scarcely permissible 
to calla “didactic” lecture on chemistry, illustrated by experiments, a laboratory exercise. 
In both the autopsy and the chemical lecture the student is aspectator and listener, not an ac- 
tive agent. At Harvard, however, and at the Bellevue College, the student is called upon by 
turns to make an autopsy.

tal demonstrations. 
Arrangements have been made through which the laboratory can be also sup- 
plied from time to time, as required, with living fresh-water and marine objects 
for biological study, as well as ample material for dissection. 
The physiological and histological department has been especially arranged 
with reference to the wants of the members of the attending class, the laboratery 
demonstrations constituting a part of the regular instruction during the winter 
session. 
At the Loomis laboratory of the University of the City of New York, in addi- 
tion to the recording and other instruments used by physiologists, the labora- 
tory contains alarge tank for administering to animals air or oxygen, compressed 
under many atmospheres of pressure; an air pump for experiments upon ani- 
mals with rarefied air; hot-air. chambers for the study of the effects of external 
heat on body temperature; large automatic models of the heart and spinal cord 
and of the mechanism of gland secretion, urine secretion, and micturition. 
At the University of Michigan medical school the subjects commonly embraced 
in the practical course relate to the physiology of the special senses, muscular 
contraction, nerve, reflex action, circulation, and respiration. A smaller room 
is devoted to advanced work and original investigation. Conveniently situated 
“are an apparatus room, a dark chamber for optical experiments, an incubation 
closet, and a large workshop containing machinists’ and carpenters’ appliances.

CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 893 
The instruction in physiology given by several schools is by means of a course 
in vivisection or lectures illustrated by vivisection. 
The laboratory instruction (excluding dissection as such) the most generally 
introduced is in histology. Although there is a tendency on one side to class 
the-work in med cal chemistry and other laboratory work under the general 
head of microscopy, as, for instance, at the Tulane University school, where there 
has been since 1889 a ‘‘ microscopical laboratory for the better study of normal 
and morbid anatomy and bacteriology,” there is a’so a tendency to group these 
subjects under the head of histology. Thus, at the University of Pennsylvania 
school, *‘each student of the second year is provided with a separate table and 
microscope and receives personal instruction in pathological histology, in micol- 
ogy, and in the microscopy of urine,” in the ‘‘ pathological laboratory.” A term 
frequently used is histological and Daeholog cal laboratory or histology and 
pathological anatomy, in which the term histology appears to indicate the 
microscopic anatomical study of undiseased matter, and the term pathological 
anatomy the microscopic study of diseased parts. 
The laboratory work in histology consists of two parts: One, the preparation 
(cutting, staining, and mounting) of the specimens and the manipulation of the 
microscope, the other the study of the import of the specimens. ’ At the Univer- 
sity of California school the second process is thought to be attained by the 
mere mechanical work of the first, ‘‘which illustrates and fixes in the mind of 
the student” the general principles of normal growth and development and the 
operation of pathological laws. At the Columbia College school the course of 
mounting, etc., teaches the ‘‘methods” not only of preparing, but of studying 
normal and diseased tissues, and furnishes the student specimens from which he 
prepares a series of outline sketches. 
On the other hand, at the Northwestern University school, students of the 
first year work two hours a week in cutting, staining, and mounting normal his- 
tological sections. Material for this course is furnished in abundance and each 
student secures a full series of normal histological slides. Free-hand drawing 
of a large number of the sections mounted in thiscourse is compulsory. Students 
of the second year devote two hours each week to the study of mounted 
sections of pathological tissue already cut and stained forthem, Free-hand 
drawings of the sections is compulsory, and the quality of a student’s work in 
this course is considered in his grading in the department of pathology. In the 
four years’ course the work in the microscopical laboratories will be more ex- 
tensive. All of the work in the microscopical laboratory is done in the presence 
and under the supervision of the demonstrators of the respective departments. 
Students are required to furnish their own slides, cover glasses, mounting 
needles, and Spatula. < 
At the Yale medical school histology is treated from the embryological 
standpoint. By this method the student is enabled to gain not only a thorough 
understanding of the structure of the various tissues and organs of the body, but 
also to trace their development and growth. The course of instruction consists 
of lectures, recitations, aid laboratory work. The lectures are very fully illus- 
trated by lantern transparencies made from photographs of typical sections and 
drawings. These are accompanied by recitations from a standard text-book. In 
the laboratory, each student receives carefully prepared sections and specimens 
of all the tissues and organs of the body, both in the adult and embryonic condi- 
tion; these are mounted for permanent preservation and from them careful 
drawings are made. Practical instruction is given each student in the technol- 
ogy of the subject. The laboratory cabinet contains an extensive reference col-- 
lection of histological specimens and serial sections of embryos; this, together 
with ihe most recent instruments and publications and an abundant supply of ma- 
terial, affords good facilities for advanced work. 
The University of Maryland school announces that, with the introduction of 
the three-years course, a laboratory of normal and pathological histology will be 
opened and that constantly increasing attention will be devoted to the develop- 
ment of this laboratory work, as the faculty fully recognizes its all-important 
influence in modern medical education. 
The bacteriology course is frequently united with the work in. histology, but 
in perhaps half a dozen cases it has a laboratory ofitsown. Atthe University 
of Michigan school work of this character is done in the laboratory of hygiene. 
The work is, in an elementary way, on the model of that done in the laboratories 
of Koch and Pasteur. 4 
The several laboratories of materia medica and experimental medicine may 
be illustrated by that of the University of the City of New York. This labora- 
tory is provided with a full assortment of the various articles of the materia

PREPARATORY MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
‘The law of 1801 of the French Republic fixed the number of medical schools at 
six, of which three had been established by the date of 1840. In the meantime 
there had gradually grown up a lower kind of school for the purpose of initiating 
students of medicine into the elements of the artof curing disease. During 1820 
these schools were placed under the control of the State educational authorities 
called the ‘‘ university,” and in 1840 they were reorganized by the minister. 
The eighteen schools whose instruction was thus unified had been founded inde- 
pendently, and on no common principle, and therefore were very diverse in their 
organization.. Some had endowments, some lived on the meager diet of tuition 
fees, but the most were supported by the city or department, or by grants from _ 
the Governmental hospital bureau. Inall the amphitheaters dissecting material 
and chemical advantages were poor or wholly absent. In 1840 a uniform course 
was given them as follows: 
Chemistry and pharmacy; natural medical history (botany) and materia 
medica; anatomy and physiology; pathology (medical clinic) ; pathology (surgi- 
cal clinic); accouchement, and diseases of women and children. Ee 
One of the great advantages of these schools, said the minister, is ‘‘ that they 
give opportunities for anatomical study, that essential of medical study which can 
not always be furnished by the higher medical faculties (7. ¢., schools), where the 
students are frequently too numerous to follow with profit all the demonstra- 
tions.” In each school there were to be six professors and two adjunct profes- 
sors and the cities were required to furnish the necessary anatomical material 
and the hospitals at least fifty beds for clinical purposes. 
In 1854 the American Medical Association had adopted a resolution ‘‘ cor- 
dially approving of the establishment of private schools to meet the increased de- _ 
sire on the part of a respectable number of medical students for a higher grade 
of professional education than can usually be acquired by ‘reading medicine’ 
under the direction of a single instructor.” In 1856 Drs. Dana, Robinson, and 
Fitch, of Portland, opened the Portland Medical School for Preparatory Instruc- 
tion, Dr. Robinson representing materia medica, midwifery, and diseases of 
women and children; Dr. Dana, physiology, pathology, and practice; Dr. Fitch, 
anatomy, surgery, and chemistry. The school was located in the Portland Dis- 
pensary and opened with two students. The faculty of the school now consists of 
9 professors and three adjunctinstructors, and the student is requested to remain — 
at least one year, which constitutesthe course. The departments of instruction 
arefour. Inthe first, systematic recitations are held in anatomy, materia medica 
and therapeutics, surgery, theory, and practice of medicine, and obstetrics. In 
the second, familiar lectures and demonstrations are given on the physical ex- 
ploration of the chest and diseases of the heart and lungs, on minor and opera- 
tive surgery, on diseases of women, and on physiology. In the third, clinical 
instruction at the school and various charitable institutions. Cases of midwifery © 
will be furnished to advanced students as far as possible. In the fourth depart- 
ment the study of practical anatomy is a prominent feature of the winter term 
and during the last weeks of this term the recitations are omitted and the whole 
attention of the student given to dissections, lectures, and clinical study. No 
degrees are conferred. $ 
At present fourteen institutions report preparatory courses in medicine; 
and two, including the Portiand school just menticned, report themselves as 
wholly engaged in such work. These courses are, with two exceptions, of two 
years, and it is sometimes indicated, in the remarks which explain why they 
have been formed, that they are for those who wish to prepare to pursue the study 
of medicine without spending the time required by a collegiate course. The 
proposition of the president of Harvard to reduce the four-yearcurriculum — 
to three years, and the adoption by Columbia College of that period as acollege 
curriculum leading to a degree to be given when the student has pursued the first — 
year’s course of the medical or other professional school is seemingly promoting 
the rapid creation of those preparatory medical courses in our higher institu- 
tions of learning. None of these courses by itself leads to a degree, even the 
_ four years’ ‘‘ special science course, antecedent to medicine” of the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin dces not lead to the bachelor of science degree. Their object 
is very well, stated by the University of Pennsylvania in the following terms: 
“This course preparatory to medicine was established in 1885 for earnest stu- 
dents who can not present the requirements for admission to the regular college 
courses or are unable to devote four years to the preparatory work, and yet de- 
sire some systematic training in scientific and liberal studies. The results have 
already shown conclusively that such a course was greatly needed and that the 
men who have faithfully pursued the work have excelled in their subsequent 
professional studies.”

‘ The course of the University of Pennsylvania, given below, is, generally speak- 
_ ing, the type of those of the Northwestern, Wake Forest, and Wisconsin univer- 
sities. At the Northwestern University, however, mathematics takes the place 
of history in the first year, and logic, psychology, and physics the place of physi- 
ology and botany in the-second. Mathematics, psychology, and physics also 
appear in the course of the Wisconsin University, while ‘rhetorical work and 
military drill are required as of other students.” The’ course at Cornell Uni- 
versity agrees with the type in having French or German, and with the 
Northwestern University in having logicand psychology. Closely related to the 
Pennsylvania type is another furnished by three elective courses, each of two years, 
which are prefaced by one or two years of collegiate s'udy, the entire course of 
three or four years being capped with the degree of bachelor of science. The 
institutions at which these courses obtain are the Johns Hopkins University, 
the John C. Green School of Science (Princeton College). and the Sheffield Scien- 
tific School (Yale University). They ave in reality academic coursesin biology, 
for they are of sufficient completeness to be rewarded with a degree, and are by 
no means preparatory to the study of medicine in the sense that the first year 
of a graded course of a medical school is preparatory to the study of the second 
year. Were this distinction nota true one every academic course in biology might 
_ be classed as a medical preparatory course, which is not the pedagogical func- 
tion of biology as a collegiate study. This type, therefore, is not represented 
in the curricula that follow.’ 
Trver preparatory courses are those offered by the University of Virginia and 
others. In one of these, that of the University of West Virginia, the instruc- 
tion is given in a ‘‘ school of biology,” it must be admitted; but it is stated that 
“practical anatomy” is required of those who intend to study medicine; while 
the others study general anatomy only. The question of priority of establish- 
- ment is always a dangerous one to discuss; but as it appears that the University 
- of North Carolina was the first.to inaugurate a course of this kind, its course, 
~ were it not of a single year, would be used to illustrate the type of curriculum 
now under discussion, instead of that of the University of Virginia. The course 
of the latter institution was established for the following reasons: 
“Graduation in medicine, as in the other departments of the University of 
_ Virginia, does not depend upon the time which has been spent in the study of 
medicine, but upon the preparation of the student as indicated by rigid written 
examinations which he is required to pass. It is possible, therefore, for a well- 
prepared and laborious student to graduate in one session, and examples are not 
wanting where such graduates have attained conspicuous success in professional 
. life. But the severe and protracted labor necessary for this purpose is attended 
with evils of which the medical faculty is fully conscious. And while the regu- 
lar course is complete as far as professional studies are concerned, it leaves the stu- 
dent without the benefit of certain scientific studies, which furnish an admirable 
preparation for and enlargement of the strictly professional course. Students 
are therefore advised to devote two sessions to the work; and for the benefit of 
those who can afford the time to pursue them, special courses in biology and 
physics have been arranged with particular regard to the training needed for 
medical studies.” 
From an examination of the curriculum given below it will be seen that the 
repetitional feature is strongly emphasized. 
Now what value do the medical schools of the country place upon these various 
kinds of preparatory courses? In the case of the course at Princeton College 
the faculty of the Medical School of Columbia College will accept it as 
equal to six months study under a preceptor in case the student attends three 
sessions at that medical college, while the Chicago College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, Rush Medical College, and the Chicago Medical College ‘‘ have ap- 
proved the four years’ course [of the University of Wisconsin], and will accept it 
as the equivalent of one year’s study.” The courseof the Portland Preparatory 
School is to supply the place of the preceptor not of the medical college, and © 
what the introductory courses of the Universities of Virginia and Pennsylvania 
are intended to do has already been very fully explained in the words of their 
own competent faculties. 
  
11t will be noticed that the department of biology of the Illinois State University (p. 1018) 
has a special course preparatory to medicine.

The admission requirements, the didactic, the clinical, and thé laboratory in- 
struction of the medical schools of the United States have in turn received at- 
tention. It has been shown how an effort is being made to dispense with a 
course in the humanities by inaugurating a preparatory course in science, and ee 
it now is necessary to examine the character of the medical curriculum as a 
whole, just as in the foregoing its parts have been discussed. 3 
In 1876 on the call of several colleges a convention was called to meet at Phil- — 
adelphia. This convention became the American Medical College Association, 
which adopted a scheme of instruction consisting of eight chairs. In 1882 the - 
scheme of minimum requirements of the Illinois State Board of Health, adopted 
For convenience these curricula and that of the U. S. 
Army medical service are placed side by side.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. - 898 
At their first meeting the Association of American Medical Colleges adopted 
the following: ‘ 
  ~ Whereas a knowledge of the elementary branches of medicine should precede a study of the 
practical branches : 
Resolved, That in the hope of inducing students to prolong and systematise their studies, this convention recommends to all medical colleges to offer to students the option of three 
courses of lectures, after a plan similar to the following : Students who have attended two full 
courses’on anatomy, chemistry, materia medica, and physiology may be examined ‘upon any 
of these subjects at the end of their second course. During their third course such students 
may devote themselves to the lectures‘upon the theory and practice of medicine, surgery, Ob- — 
stretrics, and diseases of women and children, upon which subjects only they shalibe examined atthe final examination for the degreeof M. D., theirstanding, however, to.be determined by 
the results of both examinations, 
We now turn to the examination of the curricula of the schools having 
graded courses. In the first year we find invariably instruction in chemistry, 
anatomy, physiology and histology, and dissection. Materia medica in the 
majérity of cases also comes in the first year. In half a dozen instances minor 
surgery is introduced thus early, and in eleven cases, at least, clinics, “ general 
and surgical,” as at the University of Pennsylvania, or medical, surgical, eye,and 
gynecological, as at the University of Wooster, are also held. At least 9col- 
‘leges have instruction in hygiene during the year. Gynecology, physical 
diagnosis, pathology, principles of surgery, medical jurisprudence, ethics, and 
physics haye place in the first-year course of one or more colleges. 
_ Comparing these figures with those of ten years ago, and remembering that 
43 graded courses (several notobligatory)are represented now against 13in 1881, 
it appears thatin the main featuresno change has been made and that chemistry, 
anatomy, and physiology are the groundwork of medical instruction. 
Twenty-six schools report definitely as to the examination at the close of the 
firstyear. General chemistry is disposed of by the great majority of the 26schools_ 
and normal histology and materia medica bya greatmany. Several schools have 
afinalexamination on the bonesand ligatures. Itis impossible tospeak with more 
than approximate accuracy on the characterof the examinations of the first year 
except to say that the final examinations on the fundamental subjects of anatomy, 
and physiology, and the subject of materia medica are passed during the second 
year, to the curriculum of which we now turn. 
The principal studies of the second year are anatomy, theory and practice of 
medicine, surgery, therapeutics and materia medica, obstetrics, medical chem- 
istry, and physiology. Clinical instruction is very generally given during this 
year. In twenty cases diseases of women and in fifteen, diseases of children area 
et of the curriculum, and in ten physical diagnosis and hygiene. ‘The special 
anches—eye, ear, throat, chest, and nervous disease—are represented in from 
three to five schools, and medical jurisprudence in six schools. Minor surgery ~ 
and toxicology are each represented in four schools. 
The language used by the schools in their curriculums is not uniform, but 
it appears that of 43 schools having graded or progressive courses but 3 do 
not have anatomy during the second year. One of these has ‘“‘surgical pa- 
thology,” another pathological anatomy, and the third pathology illustrated 
_ with morbid specimens.. “I'en schools do not report physiology, atleast under 
that name, though it may be included in ‘medical chemistry,” which is spe- 
cifically named by 8 of these 10 schools. But the new studies of importance of 
the year are theory and practice of medicine, surgery, and therapeutics. Par 
thology and clinical instruction are also mentioned, in many cases alone, in others 
‘in connection with medicine and surgery. Occasionally there isa term such as 
this: “ Theoretical, operative, and clinical surgery,” or *‘ theoretical and clinical 
medicine or obstetrics.” = 
At the close of the second year the final examinations in anatomy, physiology, 
materia medica and therapeutics, pathological anatomy, and chemistry take 
place, and in several schools an examination in medicine and in surgery occurs. 
The third is the practical year of the three-year course. Medicine, surgery, . 
and obstetrics are represented in the curriculum of every school, while the sub- 
jects diseases of women and of children are notreported by 4 and 12 respectively. 
The new subjects of the yearare thespecial branches, which areclinically taught, 
to wit, diseases of the eye, car, throat, skin, nose, and nervous and mental dis- 
eases, Pathology, materia medica, medical jurisprudence, and hygiene are im- 
portant features. In several schools orthopzdiatrics, electrotherapeutics, and 
bacteriology are mentioned as subjects of study. 
The character of the four years’ course is illustrated by the following pro- 
grammes: ‘

_ CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW THE STATUS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION MAY 
5 BE ADVANCED. ‘   
In response to an inquiry for opinions as to the manner in which the status of 
the medical profession might be advanced, as far as it is influenced by the in-— 
struction in a medical school, about fifty replies were made, all, with three or 
four exceptions, from ‘‘regular” schools. These are grouped under four heads: 
Suggestions that all candidates be examined and licensed (a) by State boards, 
{b) by national boards, (c) that the course be extended two or three years, and (d) 
suggestions not falling in a, b, orc. ; 
The drift of the suggestions in regard to the establishment of a State board is 
that it should examine the student as to his competency to practice medicine 
after he has obtained a certificate or diploma from a medical school or college. 
the Stats examination to be independent of the college. The dean of the Yale 
“medical school puts the matter thus: ‘(1) No practice without registration; (2) 
no registration without diploma or examination; (3) an impartial board to de- 
termine what diplomas could be registered (desirable for effect on schools and 
as best meeting the conditions in the different States); (4) registration only by 
examination, but not until conditions are more uniform in different States.” s 
In eight.cases a national board {or boards) of examination is suggested. In 
two of these the matter is expressed by saying that it would be of great ad- — 
vantage if the laws relating to medical education were uniform throughout the 
country. 
A third of the deans think that the course should belengthened to three years 
of lectures or graded course,and in some cases four years of study. As thisis — 
what is being very rapidly done, no comment is required. gis 
In the miscellaneous category are suggested apreliminary examination, more 
laboratory work, andcompulsory graduation from amedical college. Fromlowa 
it is answered: ‘‘A change in the law thatnow requiresa student to study practi- © 
cal anatomy and then makes him a criminal for obtaining the material would 
materially advance the status of the profession.” Another correspondent says: 
“The first law in Tennessee was passed by the legislature of 1888 and 1889, 
Having gained this one great step | think it unwise to attempt more too scon 
lest reaction result and we lose all.”

Dr. WiLuiAM T. HARRIS, L 
Commissioner of Education, Washington, D. C.: 
DEAR SiR: Dr. A. W. McAlester asks me to reply to the request made on the 
back of the circular sent out by your Bureau for the purpose of obtaining statis- 
tical information of the medical schools of the country. I do so with some dif- 
fidence, and beg to call your attention to two things in this connection : ; 
The first is, that length of course should, in my judgment, be measured by, 
something else or additional than mere length of time; system, manner, an 
kind of instruction are of more importancs in laying tht foundation of a good 
medical education than time. The knowledge and mental discipline which the 
average medical student brings to the school or college of medicine is limited 
and deficient; to what extent this is the case no one connected with any medical 
schoollikes to tell. Such as he is, the medical student, hears five or six or even * — 
seven lectures a day ; no one, I presume, will affirm that he masters them; and — 
when the process is repeated another term, and may be a third, any general dis- 
cernment has been sacrificed for the possession of disjointed and loose parts. The 
more a student at the beginning of his career is encouraged to attend to clinics 
and hospital practice, the more certain is this result attained ; a certain handi- 
ness has effectually taken the place of knowledge. There are three things to 
counteract and overcome these tendencies : 
1. A graded course, strictly adhered to and guarded well atthe entrance; stu- 
dents should be made to take a narrow path rather than to spread themselves 
over the whole subject. 
2. Lecture and. text-book instruction not merely descriptive, but to stand in — 
  organic relation to the whole, and to be in themselves logical treatises of the _ 
subject they deal with. x 
3. Lectures to alternate with recitations; no quizz classes, where the aim is 
to rote and cram, but proper lectures and wise questions to strengthen as well — 
as to test the intelligence, understanding, and progress of the students. 
          
-P-A-G-E-320
          
- 912 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  * The other point is, that a difference should be made between a college of med- 
- icine and a medical school; the former teaches medicine as a science, the latter 
7 mainly as an art; the former attempts to make scientific physicians, the latter 
ractitioners. A State university has no more business to make practitioners 
n medicine or advocates in law than it has to make carpenters or shoemakers. 
If the State desires to do so, it could establish technical or trade schools, of 
which the s3-called agricultural and mechanical colleges are types. They stand 
in my judgment coequal with the university, each called into life by the fore- 
sight of the General Government, and each for a distinct purpose, their connec- 
tion being, I take it, somewhat like this: i 
FB - I. State university: | IL Agricultural and mechanical college: a. Academic college. ! @. School of agriculture. b. College of medicine. 6. Mining school. 
c. College of law. ! ¢. Engineering school. 
This dissociation between the schools and colleges could of course be carried 
farther, but as I have already spoken at some length, I will only add that I be- 
lieve it to be rash to set up the claim that a medical graduate is, in virtue of his 
graduation, a skillful and experienced physician; he should, after graduation, 
_ receive one or two years hospital practice, which in no case is rendered unnec- 
_ essary on account of clinical attendance while a student.

Caer Reply from William M. Thornton, chairman of the faculty of the University of Vir- 
Ea ginia. : 
The following are recognized as the reforms most urgently needed in medical 
education : 
~ 17 The separation of the teaching and licensing bodies already carried out in 
Virginia should be adopted in all the States. Thisreform was advocated by the 
_ late Prof. James L. Cabell, of this State and University, in 1847, in an address 
x before the American Medical Association; was persistently urged by him, and 
was finally carried into effect in 1885 in Virginia. 
2. The grading of the course of medical studies and the inclusion of biology 
and comparative anatomy, as follows: 
First year course: Chemistry, physics, biology, and comparative anatomy, with 
laboratory practice in each case. 
Second year course: Human anatomy, physiology, histology, with laboratory 
F practice in each case. 
_. . Third year course: Pathology (with laboratory practice), obstetrics, gynze- 
eology, surgery (with laboratory practice), practice of medicine, materia medica, 
medical jurisprudence, clinical surgery. 
_» 38. The extension of the term of study to nine months in the year. 
The step indicated ip 3 has been approved by the faculty, but the visitors con- 
sider it one for which the public is not prepared.

‘Tf you had asked for opinions instead of information I mighthave answered: 
; “Observation proves that higher matriculation requirements and better sys- 
: tems of education do not originate with the great schools in the State of New 
York, but are forced upon them by the profession through the legislature. 
“<The schools did not adopt a matriculation examination of any value. Some 
          
    unnatural two six-months’ courses, both exactly alike, so that if the student had 
@ good memory on2 course would have been all sufficient. 
“<The protession should demand enactments requiring fitness at the entrance, 
a thorough graded course of three years of eight months each, and a rigid ex: 
amination at the termination of the three courses, if not at the end of each year. 
But you asked only for information, and I forbear.”’

  - Reply from I. T. Talbot, M. D., dean of the Boston University School of Medicine. 
The great difficulty is, and has been in the past, that the student entering 
upon the study of medicine is often entirely lacking in qualification. This 
oftentimes arises from the fact that many men as ignorant as themselves, often 
holding diplomas, acquire reputations and large incomes. ‘To obviate thisstate 
‘ of affairs this school requires the first of its four years to be devoted to the pre- 
paratory or foundation studies of a course of medical instructions. These in-~ 
clude, in addition to a good English education, Latin, physics, biology, zodlogy, 
microscopy, chemistry, botany, human osteology, comparative anatomy, and 
animal dissections. Many of these can be studied in the last year of a college 
course in arts, while the remainder can be pursued under the direction of a med- 
ical instructor or in the first year of a medical school. Knowledge on these 
subjects must be tested by a thorough entrance examination to the second year 
of oe medical course. Such students will be prepared for thorough subsequent 
work,

THEOLOGY. 
A comparison of the annual reports received from theological seminaries and 
departments during the ten years last past shows the necessity of having some 
standard by which may be determined the characteristics of a department or ~ 
school of theology. There seems to be a distinction of some kind made by the 
management of higher institutions of learning in which theological instruction is 
given; for frequently the forms sent out by this Bureau are returned with the 
indorsement: * Nota regularly organized school of theology,” or the Bureau 
fails to obtain a response at. all.' Either of these circumstances vitiates the 
comparison of statistics of one period with those of another, for the school 
which appears in the report for 1881, but thereafter fails to report or reports ~ 
that it is not a theological school for two successive years, will not appear in 
the report for 1883. . ie 
On the other hand there is still more embarrassment as to what constitutes a — 
theological curriculum. Some colleges having a course in theology return 
the whole number of the students within their walls as members of the theologi- 
cal department. The effect of this may be illustrated by the reports of an insti- 
tution during a series of years, as follows: ee

When the catalogue is at hand these errors can be rectified, but as the false 
figures are usually prepared for the printer long before the catalogue containing 
, the true ones is received they become a matter of record. 
Still referring to the curriculum of a true theological school, the question may 
be asked : ‘‘Of how many branchesis that curriculum composed?” In the case of 
medicine anatomy and physiology are undoubtedly the groundwork of thestudy, 
but pathology, therapeutics, theory, and practice, etc., are also indispensable to 
complete the training of a skillful and legitimately successful physician. And 
we see how unremittingly the profession of medicine is laboring to awaken the

MCKENDREE COLLEGE, 
Lebanon, Ill., October 22, 1890. COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION: 4 ‘ 
DEAR Sir: Recently I received from your department a circular asking for information as 
to the theological department of McKendree College, Lebanon, Ill. In reply permit me to say 
that McKendree College has no theological department or school. There is a small theological 
class of ten to twelve students who pursue a limited irregular course of study in some puanches of theology. This class can not be regarded as a department.

    legislative conscience to the necessity of passing laws that will prevent the pro- 
_ fession from being embarrassed by the practice of inadequately educated men. 
It may indeed be said that the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge 
have been in a certain sense theological seminaries, as the garb their students 
- wear indicates, and that our own Harvard and Yale were theological seminaries 
- to all intents and purposes in their early days. But if the interpretation of the 
term theological curriculum were to be based on such-a plea, the difficulty of 
the statistician would not be solved. The question would no longer be what 
should be considered a curriculum of a theological school, but what difference 
if any is there between a school of theology a and a college; forevenin the sense 
that a study of the Bible and of the history of the Christian religion is enough 
te constitute a foundation for a pastorate, every German college (gymnasium) 
might be cailed a theological school, for in it some time is Spent every day 
“upon the Bible and church’ history. Under certain conditions there is much 
to be said for a course of instruction in theology that is not too advanced or too 
long, but it is mere justice to the advanced schools of theology that they should 
be classed by themselves. | 
Without pursuing further the discussion of so delicate a topic, the Bureau 
_ illustrates: the idea of a theology school as held: by two European countries, 
placing them in juxtaposition with several American curricula, one of which 
is a type of the several seminaries of the highest class that exist in this coun- 
. try and may therefore be compared with the faculties of France, especially those 
“maintained by the Catholic Church, for the French.state faculties of theology 
- are all protestant institutions.

FOURTH YEAR, 
The regular course is completed in three 
years, but students may, with great advantage, 
continue to prosecute their studies in the 
seminary foralonger period. Itisnot thought 
best to prescribe a fixed course of study for 
graduates. Each is at liberty to devote him- 
self to those branches of theological learning 
for which he has the greatest aptitude, or 
which he judges to be most necessary or profit- 
able to himself. Accordingly graduate stu- 
dents may at their discretion attend the lec- 
tures and recitations of the regular classes for

Theological department in a college. 
This departmentis designed primarily to pre- 
are young men to preach the gospel. It is open, 
aes to all students who wish to qualify 
themselves for Christian life and work. Of this 
privilege a number have already availed them- 
selves, and it is the wish of the college author- 
ities that their action should become general. 
The following are prominent features of the 
work done in this department: 
1. Direct contact of the student with the 
Bible itself is emphasized. 2. The historical 
portions of the Scriptures are studied early in 
‘ the course. 
Greek is required of all who wish to complete 
~ thecourse. 4. Biblicalantiquitiesand ancient 
history receive attention. 5. A knowledge of 
church history is given. 
Students are praduated from this depart- 
ment on the following conditions: (1) There 
must be conclusive evidence of Christian char- 
acter; (2) In addition to the studies of this de- 
partment of theology the classical and scien- 
tific course must be completed. For either of 
these the student may substitute an equivalent 
course if hehas taken it in another institution.

REQUISITES FOR ADMISSION. 
As is to be expected, the utmost unanimity prevails among the schools as to 
the desirability of excluding persons either morally or intellectually unfit to 
enter upon the sacred calling. While almost every school will admit an appli- 
cant who belongs to another denomination than that to which the school per- 
tains, all demand that he shall be in full communion with some Christian (in two 
_ eases with an ‘‘ Evangelical”) church. The evidence of this is given by lettersof 
the presbyteries under whose care the student is requested or required to place 
himself. Nor does the precaution taken cease with the student’s admission 
within the walls of the institution; in several cases at least somé months elapse 
-before he is admitted formally as a member of the school. There is another 
‘qualification that sometimes is mentioned as a prerequisite, which is called by 
“one institution ‘earnestness of purpose” and by others a “‘ call to the ministry.” 
As to the literary qualifications demanded by the schools, some diversity 
exists. It may be said, speaking generally, that a college education, at least: 
_that of a first-class high school, is the qualification that is thought requisite. 
But there are several ways in which this requirement is sometimes modified or 
dispensed with. It is modified when the scholastic deficiences of the pupil are 
compensated for by natural ability and when the course of the seminary is five 
er more year's in duration, as is the case with many Roman Catholic seminaries, 
the Moravian Seminary, and others. It is dispensed with when the Greek and 
Hebrew Testaments are eliminated from the curriculum and the English Bible 
substituted. To enter upon the English course some institutions require that 
“the applicant for admission be at least 25 years of age. 
The instruction and lodging at these schools of theology being gratuitous and 
_ in the great majority of the schools pecuniary aid being furnished to the stu- 
dent, it is natural that abenefaction so wide in itsscope and operating constantly 
in favor of new individuals, should seek to secure the attention of the student to 
the instruction which it provides. Indeed, in addition to the testimonials as to 
moral and intellectual fitness spoken of in a preceding paragraph, some schools 
are known to require a declaration in writing from the student on his admission, 
which may be represented by the following formula: 
“Deeply impressed with a sense of the importance of improving in knowledge, 
prudence, and piety, inmy preparation for the gospel ministry, I solemnly prom- 
-ise, in reliance on divine grace, thatI will faithfully and diligently attend on 
_allthe instructions of this seminary, and that I will conscientiously and vigi- 
lantly observe all the rules and regulations specified in the plan for its instruc- 
tion and government so far as the same relate to the students; and that I will 
obey all the lawful requisitions and readily yield to all wholesome admonitions 
_ of the professors and board of trustees while I shall continue a member of the 
institution.” 
Of the 145 schools given in Table 16 (p. 1045), 104 answer specifically the question 
_ addressed to them, ‘‘Have you noticed during the last decade that the stu- 
dents of later years were better prepared to enter upon the scientific study 
of their intended profession than those who preceded them?” In some cases the 
assumed charge. In many others the inquiry was passed by with a mere scratch 
of the pen, etc. Of the 104 specific answers, two say outright that they have 
nothing to base an opinion on, which leaves 102 schools whose answers are of 
service in the canvass of this important matter. Of these 102 answers 78 are in 
the affirmative, the greatest number being simply ‘‘ yes,” but 17 answer ‘‘de- 
cidedly,” or ‘‘very much,” or ‘‘ marked or decided advance,” asthe case may be,

answer ‘‘no,” two of them adding that they are getting fewer graduates in let- 
ters or sciences. There are twoclassesof statements that deserve consideration, 
to wit: Those relating to the effect of the elective system in collegés and those ~ 
giving the reason why the scholastic character of the applicants for admission 
has improved. 
“One of ourimportant seminaries in New England answers the question thus: 
The optional system tends to make the Greek preparation deficient; history is 
lacking; the English language and literature do not seem to have a‘lequate at- 
tention. Students are not able to read Latin with facility ; the philosophic — 
systems seem to be a priori. We do not find a better average than in previous _ 
years.” 
y By another eastern seminary of the highest standing we are informed: More 
come-now than formerly with some preparation in Hebrew, which is a distinet 
gain. On the other hand, the spread of the elective system in colleges, with 
other causes, has probably lowered the average quality of preparation in Greek. 
From the Upper Mississippi Valley it is learned that ‘‘ the scientific courses in 919 
while about half adozen answer “slightly ” or “somewhat,” ete. Twenty schools      
colleges make more students enter the seminary knowing little or no Greck,” - 
but otherwise no change has been noticed. 
‘From Pennsylvania one school reports that the students have much general 
intelligence and are equal to those who preceded them in training of faculties, 
but are behind them in the classical training especially called for in theological . 
schools. By another, it is said that their college training has been broader and 
more varied, but it is not apparent that there has been any better mental de- 
velopment than under the earlier systems of college study when the curriculum 
was narrower. Depth has been sacrificed to breadth. From a third the answer 
is received: ‘*No; as a general thing it may be said that classical schools have 
not yet distinguished themselves for thoroughness of mental training.” 
The Harvard and Yale divinity schools, on the other hand, assure “the Bureau 
that there has been a very undoubted improvement, the latter school attributing | 
it to stricter requirements for admission. The Harvard school instances the 
fact that all but one of its members were degree men, adding that a few years — 
ago this would have been impossible. A half a dozen other seminaries attribute 
the improvement in scholarship of those they are admitting to their having ex- 
acted more elevated attainments for admission. Several attribute the fact to 
the advance of education in the South or West, as the case may be. 
To the question Has the average age of the freshman advanced? an almost uni- 
versal No is returned. In a univ versity for the colored race, the dean answers 
that, whereas some years ago the students of the divinity school were ministers 
secking further education, now the students come fresh from the Drape f 
school. Two seminaries give statistics. The dean of the Augustana Seminary © 
at Rock Island gives the average age as varying from 274 to 293 during the last 
years; in some of the earlier classes it was over 30. Union Theological Seminary 
reports a slight increase, as follows: 
  Taking the answers to the two questions as to scholarship and age and con- - = 
sidering them together some corroboration is found for the remarks upon the 
influence of the high schools, made under medical instruction (p.878). But 
though the great extension of public higher elementary instruction, or, as it is 
called, secondary instruction, is in all probability subserving in America the 
purpose accomplished by the ‘colleges of Germany and France (Gymnasien and 
lycées) it is still interesting to note the percentage of college graduates in 
attendance at our seminaries of theology. In attempting such a showing the 
Bureau must ask the indulgence of the reader who expects the utmost mathe- 
matical exactness. The diagrams given on pp. 846-7 are accurate as far as 
the schools have reported. But many schools will not report or insist in re- 
porting by making a scratch of the pen so that it is not possible to tell whether 
they mean that an account of such matters has never been taken or that there are 
no students of the kind in their institution. The table which followsisanattempt 
to represent the percentage of college graduates in theological seminaries, by 
showing the percentage that has been reported by 27 schools in various parts 
of the country for the 10 years last past. Before canvassing the table, however, 
it may be said that, in the schools reporting an improvement in the scholastic 
attainments of their freshmen, 30 per cent of the attendance were students hay- — 
ing a degree in letters or science. .

The object of the Salesianum is the remote and immediate preparation for the holy priest-

In accordance With this object, the education imparted embraces the classical studies, phi- 
losophy, and theology, nine years in all, with the following courses: 
I. CLASSICAL COURSE (embracing five years). 
The following branches are taught during 
this course: 
1. Christian doctrine. 
2. Ancient languages: 
(a) Latin (Schultz’s Grammar and Exer- 
cise-book, Nepos, Cesar, Cicero, Vir- 
gil, Horace). (b) Greek (Spies’s Grammar, Exercise-

This system, though not characteristic of, isnot unrepresented among Protes/ 
tantschools. 
The two-year course is the English course. No better illustration can be 
given as to what this course is than the English course of Oberlin Theological 
Seminary. This course has been established in view of the present urgentneed 
of more ministers and of the fact that many young men now in secular business 
would be willing to give their lives to the preaching of the gospel, but can not 
pursue a course of preparation extending over 10 years. It is designed for ma- 
ture young men of at least 25 years of age, who, though possessing perhaps but a 
common English education, have acquired, in practical business, familiarity with 
affairs and acquaintance with men. It is believed thatmen of this class by two — 
years of judiciously applied study can acquire such a knowledge of the English — 
Bible, of systematic theology, and of other fundamental branches as will qualify — 
them for great usefulness in many fields. Should a sufficient number apply, 
some special additional instruction will be provided for those looking forward to — 
Y.M. é A. secretaryships as a substitute for the homiletic training of candidate: 
for the pulpit. The programme is as follows: :

are fully prepared to proceed with the study of the Scriptures in the Greek or — 
Hebrew or who have taken the first degree in college ; but, to afford profitable 
instruction to those who have not a classical education, and to those who desire

Asillustrating a composite course (academico-theological) the course in divin- 
~ ity of the Southwestern University is given. The curriculum of this university 
is arranged on the codrdinate school principle, the completion of the course of 
acertain number of schools entitling the student toa degree. The divinity 
_ course is the only professional course as yet established in the university. It 
was organized by the board in June, 1885, and has been in operation for five 
-years with the most satisfactory results. The various schools and departments 
of this course stand in the same relations to the university as the academic 
schools. The two faculties are in reality but one, and have the same govern- 
_ ment and discipline. The chancellor is the chief executive and the pr esiding 
officer of the whole. Schedule of recitations is asfollows:

    peaches 
This department may be considered under three Heads, tHe first of which is 
concerned with commentaries on or introductions to the study of the text of the 
Greek and the Hebrew Testaments, and the second and third with the personal 
study of the text of those works. Tt is evident however that the translation of — 
the Greek and Hebrew Testaments may b2 made partially an exegetical exercis2, 
even in the case of the tyro in Greek or Hebrew, and may become wholly soin 
the case of well-prepared students. In the lar, er seminaries of the country the 
chairs of exegesis are known as ‘‘ New (or. Old) Testament language and lit- 
erature” or as ‘‘Litarature and interpretation of the Old (or New) Testament,” 
as the case may be, or words to the came effect. Occasionally there is an in 
structor in Greek or Hebrew to assist the chair. The arrangement of one of the 
important theological schools of the country will illustrate, however, that the 
name of the chair is not always indicative of the special work performed by 
its occupant. In this school the philological and exegetical work is distributed 
among two chairs (both. endowed) and an associate ‘professor of biblical philol- 
ogy. “The titles of the chairs are ‘(Hebrew and cognate languages” and ‘“ sa- 
ered literature.” The professor of the Hebrew and cognate languages leaves 
the philological work in Hebrew to the associate professor of philology and con- 
fines himself, in the regular course, to the higher exegesis of the Old ‘Testament, 
while the professor of sacrel literature devotes himself to teaching both New 
Testament Greek and exegesis. 
The threefold character of the work of the department of exegetical study is 
rather clearly indicated during the first year of the American theological course, 
inasmuch as the work in Greek and Hebrew of that year is probably more philolog- 
ical than theological ; though the language exercises are generally accompanied — 
by study ofa work on the harmony of the gospels and sometimes by the principles 
of higher critic How far the preparation of the students will permit of the 
lower or textual criticism of the languagesin which the testaments are written, 
it is impossible to say. The Greek text read is usual one of the synoptic Gospels 
or the Acts, sometimes itis John, at other times the Septuagint, or one or more 
of the Pauline Epistles. The study of Hebrew is usually concarned with the ~ 
grammar of the language and obtaining a vocabulary. 
In the second year of exegetical study in the higher order of seminaries” 
the text of the testaments becomes the foundation of the work and there is nite 3 
given to the department that justifies the inclusion of the study of Greek and 
Hebrew asa branch of exegesis. In Greek the Pauline epistles and in Hebrew the — 
historical and prophetical writings and the Psalms are the principal exegetical 
studies of the second year, the text giving occasion for an excursus in one or 
another direction, as may be illustrated by the following course:    
      FIRSD TERM OF SECOND YEAR. 
1. Lectures on the higher criticisms of the 
poetical and prophetical books once a week by 
the professor of Hebrew. 
2. Hebrew poetry: Exposition of selections 
of various kinds of poetry from the earlier 
periods of Hebrew history twice a week by the 
same professor. 8. Exposition of the Book of the Acts or of 
the epistles of the imprisonment, with special SECOND TERM OF SECOND YEAR. 
   1. Hebrew poetry: Exposition of sélections — 
from the later parlors of Hebrew poetry twice — 
a week, including portions of Proverbs, Job, _ 
Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes, with the pro- © 
fessor of Hebrew. 
2. Critical and poetical exposition of the 
Epistle to the Romans, Galatians, or First 
Corinthians, twice a week with professor of 
sacred literature, 
  lectures on practical exposition as felated to 
preaching, twice a week by the professor of 
sacredlierature. 
     
  In the third year exegetical study approximates, from the Old Testament side, 
the history of the Messiah—that is to say, the early history of the Christian re- _ 
ligion—and, from the New Testamentside, the history of its earliest teaching. 
The study of the prophets, and especially of the facts of Messianic prophecy is 
preéminently the final study in Hebrew exegesis, while the study of the Pauline 
epistles, especially those to the Romans and Hebrews, and the catholic epistles 
is equally preéminent in the exezesis of the New T tament. From an exami- 
nation of the programmes of the theological seminaries of the country, atendency 
is shown to take up the historical books of the New Testament as introdcetory 
and follow them with the Pauline epistles during the middle and senior years.

General and special introduction to the books of the New Testament, with an examination 
of the history and special characteristics of each book, and an outline analysis of its contents. 
This occupies one exercise a week throughout the course, and is intended to secure, on the 
part of the student, the careful translation or reading of all the books, with a study of the plan 
and argument of each book and of passages of special interest in it, together with ar investiga- 
_ tion of its canonicity and of other questions belonging to introduction. - 
IIL. EXEGESIS. 
First year.—\. The Gospels: Translations and exegesis of select passages, embracing the chief events in the life of Christ, the miracles, the parables, and several of the principal discourses.

‘book, in connection with the studies of its plan and an outline analysis of its course of thought. 
Second year.—The Epistle of Paul: Translation and exegesis of Romans and Hebrews. 
Third year.—The Catholic Epistles and Revelation: Translation and exegesis of James, First 
Peter, First John, and of select portions of the other Catholic epistles, with the translation of

i     Biblical archeology (or ‘‘antiquities”) is usually classed under exegesis and 
porhaps should have been made a fourth division of the subject. But its study ~ 
-’. dogs not yet appear to have been introduced with the thoroughness that war- 
rants such prominence, though lately a Hull professorship of Biblical geog- 
raphy and archeology has been established in the Ryder Divinity School of ~ 
Lombard University. More prominent as an exegetical study than archxology — 
is the study of the Semitic languages and of the hieroglyphics and cuniform 
characters, the last two being, indeed, a prerequisite for first-hand archeological 
study in the present conception of the term. Asthese philological studies are 
optional they will be spoken of after the remaining three heads of the theolog- 
ical course have been given. A 
In closing this brief summary of the exercises of the department of exegesis 
~ aword of explanation may be permitted. In several cases the philological in-— > 
struction in Greek and Hebrew is not called exegesis but philology: inothercases”  ~ 
the instruction in the works written in-one or the other of these languages and > 
in books written about those works is called Biblical study, and in others still 
Old and New Testament study and interpretation, In distributing the matters 
taught in the way of exegesis under the heads of commentary and study of the 
texts it must not be supposed that this Bureau has attempted or desired toim- _~ 
prove theological terminology, but that convenience alon2 has been consulted. 
‘The information possessed by the Bureau will not permit a close classification — 
into philological and exegetical study, the proper distinction, and it is not im- 
possible that such a classification can only be made after a thorough personal 
study of the syllabus of the various courses in exegesis as they are actually | 
given. Indeed, when the question of philology is up as a department of study in 
a theological seminary it is advisable to consider that at the Harvard Divinity . 
School German is required for the degree of bachelor, and that the German is = 
recommended to be taken in the junior year, ‘‘ as a knowledge of this language 
will be found of great service during the remainder of the course.” Nor should 
it be forgotten that in the Western Theological Seminary and elsewhere Augus- 
tine’s De fide verum quze non videntur, and Thomas Aquinas’s In Symbolum 
Apostolorum Expositio, ete., are read in the original, and that ‘‘ high latinity ” 
is a study in the French faculties of theology. ma   THEOLOGY. 
In natural sequence though not in importance the department of theology fol- 
lows that of exegesis. This departmentof the curriculum may be treated under 
two general heads, the first of which may take the name of systematic theology ~ 
or dogmatics, and the second that of apologetics or polemical theology. The 
first head may certainly be subdivided into theology (proper), anthropology, so- 
teriology, and eschatology. Perhaps Christology (as far as it can be separated 
from exegetical work and soteriology) angelology, and finally ecclesiology (as 
far as it can be separated from the material facts of ecclesiastical crganization 
onone side and from soteriology and Christology on the other) should be added. 
The course in systematic theology is usually introduced by a general survey 
of the subject which it may be permitted to cali encyclopedia. Occasionally this 
is made to bear upon the work of the student by pointing out methods that he 
should follow or aids that he should avail himself of, while pursuing his studies. 
Christian ethics also appears in the first year of the course, though it frequently 
comesamong the studies of the thirdyear. Frequently theology proper (the being 
and attributes of God) is begun during the first year, but the subject is always fin- 
ished with the second. Closely connected with theology proper is the study of 
man, his spiritual nature and fall, cailed anthropology, and this leads naturally 
to soteriology or the doctrine of salvation,and that to eschatology. Sometimes 
all these several divisions of systematic theology are taken up and finished dur- 
ing the second year, but the rule is that eschatology comes in the third year, 
leaving anthropology and for the most part soteriology as the second or middle 
year subjects in this department. In addition to the headings already given 
the terms angelology and pneumatology occasionally occur and those of Christol- 
ogy and ecclesiology often, especially in the case of the former. In one institu- 
tion the division of soteriology is composed of objective soteriology, which in- 
cludes ‘‘ the covenant of grace, Christology, the person, offices, work, and states 
of Christ,” and subjective soteriology, which includes ‘‘ The Holy Sprit, calling, 
regeneration, faith, etc.” At anothen institution the subject of Christology is 
defined perhaps with perfect accuracy, as ‘‘ Christ’s Theanthropic person, divin- 
ity, and humanity.” LEcclesiology may be said to be a third-year study. 
  
-P-A-G-E-334
  -‘JEDUCATION REPORT, 1889-905 5.5> 
é . | aa 
In the third year eschatology, ecclesiology, apologetics, and a general review 
of the studies of the course, figure prominently. In addition soteriology appears 
so frequently that it is doubtful whether it isnot as much a third year asa 
, second yearstudy. Christian evidences comes frequently in the first year, though 
_ under the title of apologetics it is here included among the third year studies. 
As in the schools of the Episcopal church there seems to be a variation, 
indicated cither by the phras:ology or by the text-book employed, from the 
usual curriculum of the department of theology, it seems advisable to insert a 
curriculum of one of the seminaries of that denomination. In selecting this il- 
_lustration a curriculum has been taken that will not only exemplify sectarian as op- 
posed to ‘‘nonsectarian” instruction, but also be of more general interest as 
‘showing the plan upon which the professor of divinity conducts the exercises of 
the department under his direction. 
                    Systematic divinity. 
In this department will be carried on two lines of study. In one, begun in the junior year 
“4 ay Spaoeee into the years following, under the direction of the assistant professor, the object 
will be: ene First, to ascertain the Scriptural support for the received doctrine of the church; 
_. $acondly, to trace the history and development of doctrine till it has reached its present form. 
‘The text-books used will be namely: Pearson on the Creed; Brown on the Articles; Bruce on 
_ the Humiliation of Christ; Oxenham on Atonement; Mason's Faith of theGospel; Martensen’s 
. Dogmatics; with partial study of Scott’s Christian Life, Liddon’s. Bampton Lectures, Hook- 
er’s Ecclesiastical Polity, and Magee on Atonement. 
It is not thought needful to mention here the many books of reference whose constiltation is | 
advised so far as there is time, unless it be Dorner on the Person of Christ, Pusey and Richey 
on the Filioque Clause, and Bull on Justification. on 
‘The second course, begun in the middle year and continued in the senior year will consist én- 
tirely of lectures by the professor of divinity, and its object will be to mould Christian doctrine 
into a coherent whole, giving it philosophic vindication by relating it to all truth. In this 
course will be read, parallel with the lectures, the professor’s own work, ‘Christian Doctrine 
Harmonized, and its Absolute Rationality Vindicated.” 
In several institutions of another denomination it is customary to take a gen- 
eral and final review of the whole subject of theology in relation to the tenets 
of the denomination which supports the school. Thus in one school, during the 
latter part of the third year, a ‘special series of lectures will be delivered on 
the Westminister symbols, including the history of their formation, their doc- 
trinal contents, and their influences and claims.” In another seminary the sub- 
ject of ‘Christian theology” is finished by a critical study in the Westminster 
confession as.a final review of systematic theology; while at.a third seminary of 
the same denomination the subject is broadened out during the second term of 
the final year into the subject of ‘‘symbolies,” which deals with “‘ comparative 
theology,” being an exposition of the doctrinal differences between Romanism 
and Protestantism, and the variation of the protestant churches, and is treated 
from the denominational standpoint during the first term under the head of 
church polity. 
The following syllabus will show, though with the mere accuracy of a numer- 
ical average, the type of the course in the department of theology; it may be 
~ added, however, that it seems exceptionally full on the subject of apologetics 
- which here enters into the curriculum of two of the three years of the course, 
and is conducted by a specialist with the title of ‘‘ Instructor in Apologetics.” 
Department of systematic theology.—Mr. Gillett, Junior Class, two hours per week ee the 
first semester; Historic Apologetics, including both the Ecclesiastic and Christian divisions, 
‘Middle Class, three hours per week during the first semester: Philosophic Apologetics, includ- 
ing the Anthropic and Theistic divisions. 
Professor Beardslee, Junior Class, two hours per week during the second semester: Theology 
grcier, treating of the being and attributes of God, decrees, creation, providence. angelology, 
lemonology, and theodicy Middle Class, four hours per week during the first semeste’ =

ology, including the person and work of Christ, and the application of redemption; three hours 
' per week during the second semester, continuation of the same studies. Senior Class, two hours 
\ per week during the first semester: The work of the Holy Spirit, ecclesiology, eschatology, and 
inspiration; four hours per week during the second semester, Christian ethics. The entire 
course is pursued by means of an inductive study of the Bible, requiring constant individual 
investigation in the original languages, and in connection with each leading doctrine an exam- 
ination of ecclesiastical theology from the sources.     
    
  CHURCH HISTORY. 
The third great department of the theological course is the history of Judaism 
as precursory to Christianity and the history of Christianity. The department 
has several names—Kcclesiastical (or Church) History, Historical Theology, 
Biblical and Ecclesiastical History, History of Religion. Sometimes the term > 
Church Polity is added to the name Ecclesiastical (or Church) History, and 
     
-P-A-G-E-335
  
  - historic connection between Judaism and Christianity and of the apostolic age 
_ respective departments ; but not every institution can afford this wealth of in- 
-practical theology. As a general introduction to the subject the following is      
   
     
   
    
“CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL *SCHOOLS. «927. 
when this happens the combination may be taken as a definition of whatis meant 
by historical theological. - uf 
Two types are shown by the courses of this department. One treats of the 
as the first period, the patristic and consolidating epochs as. the second, and the 
epoch of protest or Reformation and the results as the third. But the more 
usual division is to make the point of departure for each period, (1) the begin- = 
ning of our era, (2) the Council of Nicea, and (8) the Reformation. The treat. 
ment of Jewish history shows some variation. At one institution the “ history 
and the religion” of that people is treated of in the junior year as Biblical The- 
olozy, while under the general head of ‘‘ History,” ‘‘Apostolical Christianity” is 
given, the professors in each branch being widely known as specialists in their 
struction, The Old Testament has, in addition to its sacred, a historical character, 
but it is impossible to say how far the exegetical work in Hebrew brings out the 
history of the people of Israel. In one institution, at least, the Old Testament 
is studied as history *‘ directly from the text,” for two hours a week during the 
first semester of the junior year and three hours during the second semester, » 
As the occasional use of the term church polity in connection with church his- 
tory indicates, and the logical development of the results of the reformation ef- 
fers the oceasion, the organization of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches 
bocomesasubject of examination and the examination is naturally made with rela- 
tion to the particulars of the faith professed by the denomination to which each_ 
school pertains. Inthe foregoing we havefound the Episcopalian Church intro-_ 
ducing the study of itscreed and articles of faith in the second year, but the study 
of the “confessions” or, to use the scholastic expression, the differentia of the » 
beliefs held by the Christian peoples, is usually deferred until the final year in the 
depatment now underconsideration. A pronounced instance of this isshown by 
the following course : 
suNION YEAR. 
The Biblical Geozraphy will occupy ten weeks of the first term, and the remainder of the 
year will be devoted to Sacred History, including both the Old and New Testament, and lect- 
ures on Biblical Archwology. This requires two hours per week in the recitationroom. 
MIDDLE YEAR. 
History of the Christian Church from the Apostolic age to the present. This will include 
lectures on Patristics and the Councils, This is required three hours a week. Christian — 
Biography and History of Special Churches are electives for one hour a week. 
SENIOR YEAR. x 
History of Methodism will seek to give a general view of the origin, growth and work of the 
ehurch. Weekly recitations will be held in History of Doctrines throughout the year. The His- 
tory of Methodism, Comparative Symbolics of American Churches and Hymnology are required | 
two hours a week. They will be taught by lectures in connection with a printed syllabus. 
Comparative Religions, Christian Art, and statistics of Religious Progress are elective two 
hours a week. Throughout the entire course students will be assigned subjects which they are 
to study in thelibrary, and present these upon the same in the class. ‘The aim from first to last is 
to lead thestudent as far as practical to depend upon his own careful study of the topics. .   
. HOMILETICS AND PASTORAL THEOLOGY. 
The fourth department of the theological course is practical and is usually 
called homiletics when dealing with the preparation of the sermon, and pastoral — 
theology when it is concerned with the other practical work of the minister. 
It is the intention here to treat of both these as divisions of the depart-xent of © 
taken from the catalogue of a theological department in a western university: 
PRACTICAL THEOLOGY. 
“The importance of the instruction of this department to young men pro- | 
posing to enter upon the work of our ministry may be seen by reference to the — 
fact that most young ministers are now required to begin their labors without — 
the care and oversight once given by the senior preacher. Formerly the junior 
preacher was expected to engage for several years in acquiring the needful ex- © 
erience before assuming the management and responsibilities of a charge. 
Bat in these days, a young man upon leaving school is required to perform the — 
full work of an experienced minister, with but the scant advies and direztion 
of his presiding elder, as occasion may serve once or iwice a year. The chair — 
of practical theology is intended to supply by direct instruction that which was 
   
-P-A-G-E-336
     EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
_ once furnished in some measure by the senior minister. The object is in part 
to teach the student how to put into practice that which he has mastered in 
the other departments of the school, especially that which relates to Christian 
character and conduct. Homiletics and pastoral theology will have a large 
place in the work of this department. Further, it is important to his interests 
and to the work as well, that he should become acquainted with the principles 
ard law of our church, so as to wisely administer its discipline in the interest 
- of the Gospel, and that he should be thoroughly acquainted with the great 
- connectional plans and purposes of the church, so as to enter intelligently and 
enthusiastically upon the work of our ministry. During thefirst year, atten- 
tion will be given to homiletics, pastoral theology, and preaching before the 
school. Lectures on the articles of religion, the discipline, constitution, and 
polity of the church will mainly occupy students of the second year. Questions, 
of ecclesiastical law, courts of trial and appeal, church benevolences, and Sun- 
day school and general church work will, during the third year, receive at- 
tention.” “ 
The study of homiletics is begun more freauently perhaps in the first than in 
the second year, and is, of course, accompanied by drill in elocution, The study 
is a special case of literary analysis, appreciation, and use, the models being 
found in sermons by eminent divines or much more frequently in compendiums 
- on pulpit oratory or in the professorial or other criticism of the classroom. In 
several cases lay rhetoric is studied. Extemporaneous work is, seemingly, ac- 
cented and oral delivery of excogitated work insisted upon. The endeavor is to 
make the work as practical as possible, and in one instance the students are 
called upon to ‘‘participate in the conduct of a large children’s [Sunday school] 
* class led by the professor each week.” So important is this subject of homilet- 
& = bay one school speaks of ‘‘the paramount importance of the ministers’ pul- 
pit work. Z 
The work in pastoral theology, though less brilliant, is certainly not less val- 
uable. In the proper acceptation of the term it treats of the pastor as an agent 
_ and administrator rather than as an orator. But as the duties of these lines of 
activity require, if they are to be well performed, traits of a high order, the at- 
tributes desirable for the pastor to possess also receive great consideration. 
Occasionally church polity is included under this head. Sunday school and 
other religious agencies for recruiting the congregation, the conversion of the 
heathen in foreign parts, etc., also fall within its scope. The following courses 
will render further remark unnecessary : 
Course of the theological department in a university of the South. 
Homiletics and Pastoral Theology. 
In the Trinity term the studies of the junior class seek to make clear such fundamental ques- 
tions as what a pastoris? What are his relations toward God and toward man? What are 
his motives, responsibilities, and helps? What should be the main outline of his continuous 
and lifelong course of study ? And what is the best method of preparation of sermons, whether 
unwritten or written? Distinctly to understand these questions is of highest importance, as 
‘well for.its influence upon the student’s devotedness and zeal, as for the advantage of applying 
- homiletic theory to immediate practice in sermon writing and in preaching during his seminary 
life. Hence, these topics are placed at the beginning of the junior year, and that they may be perfectly understood they are taught in the threefold way of (a) the text-book and recitations; _ (0) printed lectures selected by thesprofessor and read by the students in turn, and (c) the in- 
structions of the professor. Then, throughout the remainder of the three years this knowledge 
is made use of in the writiitg of sermons, and in extemporaneous speaking, for which the Homi- letical Society of St. Luke’s Hall and the literary societies of the university furnish the oppor- 
tunity at least once in every week. e 
In the senior year the studies are upon the administration of the sacraments, the perform- 
ance of the occasional offiee of the Book of Common Prayer, and the practical detail of pastoral 
_ duty. Much attention is given to the ae of the service, and in particular to an accurate 
~ and intelligent reading of the lessonsfrom Holy Scripture. The regular course of study iu this. 
per ee is supplemented by the able and instructive lectures of the rightreverend the bishop 
of Louisiana.

correct habits in the preparation and delivery of sermons. These exercises consist of recita- 
tions from standard treatises, with lectures, elucidations, and criticism; carefully prepared 
analyses and written criticisms by the student of sermons by eminent preachers; presentation 
of plans of sermons before the class, with criticism by students and by the officer; and the prep- 
aration and delivery of sermons before the seminary, with criticism by students and officer. 
In all cases of criticism before the classes and the seminary, in addition to the negative 
criticism to which the student is subjected, the professor holds himself responsible for an inde- 
pende nt treatment of the text, or the subject, that the student may not be left conscious sim- 
py of his defects and errors, but may haye suggested to him a method by which he may improve 
is own ideal and work,

Department of Practical Theology. 
Junior class, two hours per week during the first semester: Introduction to practical the- 
ology: The foundation for the whole course is laid by an expository study in the Gospels of 
the Lord's selection of His disciples, and of the personal training that he gave them in char- 
acter, faith and methods of work. The first principles of the construction of the sermon are 
inductively drawn from the Biblical history of preaching. Constant practice in sermon 
analysis is required. Middle class, one hour per week during the first semester, four hours a 
week during tne second: The study of Homiletics is completed, the practical exercise of making 
and delivering sermons is continued. Christian nurture, theoretical and practical, is also studied. Practice In preparing sermons, addresses, and class exercises for children, and par- 
ticipation in the conduct of a large children’s class, led by the professor each week, supple- 
ment the study of theories. The history and methods of the Sunday school, Young People’s 
Endeavor Societies, and Christian associations are objects of original research. A prelimi- 
nary course in congregational polity is also given. Senior class, four hours per week through- 
out'the year: The principles and methods of evangelistic work, pastoral care, Christian eco- 
nomics, and Christian benevolence, ecclesiastical polity and administration, and practical 
liturgics. One half the year is devoted the comparative study from the sources of Christian 
sociology. Preaching before the seminary is required. In all classes, besides the constant 
homiletic drill, practical personal work in Sunday school teaching, evangelistic cfforts of many 
kinds, reformatory and preventive agencies, charity methods, and labor with individuals for 
their conversion and upbuilding are expected of each student under the supervision of the pro- 
fessor.

CHANGES DURING THE DECADE 1880-90. 
a ELECTIVES, 
‘Before speaking on this, in college history, well-worn question, let us distin- 
uish between a special or nondegree course in a thevlogical schcol and a course 
omposed of a certain number of studies chosen by the siudents from among a 
category of subjects offered by the faculty in lieu of an invariable curriculum, 
To state the question thus is to answer it. The special courses for ministers or 
for others who seek to extend their acquirements in languages will be spoken of 
under the head of optional studies. 
In 1885, the Theological Department of Oberlin College introduced the elective 
_ system for one-half of the course for B. D. For this degree students were re- 
quired to complete work amounting to 1,050 hours of lectures. The required — 
‘studies demanded 485 hours, the elective studies might extend to 1,252 hours, 
_ but 565 hours were required. At present the daily exercises are as follows :

tures upon this system. The studies of the several departments may be pursued in such order 
as is necessary to secure the desired electives; but continuous courses, such as church history 
a, or homiletics a, should never be interrupted until completed.1 
, The study of Syriac in the second year and the study of Chaldee in the third 
year were elective in the Hamilton Theological Seminary as early as 1885, they 
being optional studies at the date of 1881. In this institution the student. 
may pursue a ‘‘full course ” or a ‘‘Greek-English course ” (which dispenses with 
Hebrew and begins the study of Greek) or an ‘‘ English course ” (which dispenses 
with both Hebrew and Greek). 
About 1886 or 1887 ‘‘ electives ” were introduced in the Newton Theological 
Institution, the prescribed studies requiring from 9 to 10 hours a week. Most 
of the elective courses being open to more than one class, they are not arranged 
according to classes, but according to the term in which they are given. No 
elective course is begun unless there is an attendance of four or more students. 
In the first term the electives are the Semitic languages, including Assyrian and 
Biblical Greek, exegetical work in Old and New Testament apologetics, Christian 
theology according to John, inspiration, comparative religion and history of mis- 
sions, and preaching and methods—14 courses in all of 1 or 2 hours.a week, some 
onea to all students, others open only to the middle and senior classes. The 
second term, for it appears that each course only continues one term, is very 
similar to the first in character, being, it would seem, a sort of continuation 
of the first term, though the courses of both terms are numbered consecu- 
tively from 1 to 30, course 15 being the first course of the second term. A pe- 
culiarity of the courses of the second term is indicated by expressions such as 
this ‘‘ Course 15, 1891, and every third year Old Testament history ; Course 17, ~ 
1889 and 1891, rapid reading of Hebrew Testament.” 
From the dean of Harvard it is learned that during the decade ‘‘ the studies 
have gradually changed in the way of enlargement, the elective system having 
been introduced to some extent,” while the acting warden of the Seabury Di- 
vinity School informs the Bureau that ‘‘We hope soon to introduce the elective 
system,” and that ‘‘the German seminary system is increasing in favor.” This 
seminary system is in vogue at Harvard; and perhaps elsewhere, without des- — 
ignation as such.? § 
With the year 1890-91 thesystem of elective studies will be introduced in the 
AnJover Theological Seminary in order to encourage a degree of specialization 
and to offer an increased number of subjects, particularly in Biblical studies. 
While the study of theology is in itself an election, says the faculty, and neces- 
sarily includes foundation work in Hebrew, Greek, dogmaties, church history, 
homiletics, and other branches of sacred learning, there may properly be op- 
portunity for more extended research in one or another of the principal depart- 
ments, and in accordance with the tastes and aptitudes of the students. The 
amount of prescribed work by lecture hours is therefore somewhat reduced in 
the middle and senior years, and several courses are offered from which a re- 
quired number of hours is to be chosen. All the elective courses of each year 
are offered to both classes, and entirely different courses are offered in alternate _ 
years. A sufficient number shall be chosen to make, with prescribed studies, 
an average of 12 hours a week in the middle and 10 in the senior year. Old Tes- 
tament studies include the three courses of introduction, exegesis, and Biblical

feature of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary requires notice. The 
pian of instruction is quite similar to that of the University of Virginia. Every 
department of study is elective, and a separate degree is given upon graduating 
each department; and the degree of “full graduate ” when all have been com- 
pect or “English graduate” when all, except Hebrew and Greek. Many stu- 
nts remain only one year, others two, ‘electing certain departments at, pleas- 
ire, with advice. of the professors. ‘We ave satisfied from thirty years of 
experience,” says Dr. Broadus, ‘‘ that the elective works best when complete and, 
consistent.”      
   
     
     
        
       
    
   
    
    OPTIONAL STUDIES. 
The optional studies of the theological seminaries are languages and those 
‘ecial courses of individual or collective inquiry and mutual criticism that are 
caled seminariums, or, touse the Latlnform,seminaria. An illustration oi this 
seminarium may be found in the case of the Lane Theological Seminary, which 
has as an optional. course a ‘‘ special class for the study and criticism of the lit- 
‘ary sources of ancient church history,” once a week throughout the year, the 
chief subject of investigation during 1889-90 being the formation of the New 
‘estament canon. 
But the great optionals are the Semitic languages, the Egyptian hier oglyphies, 
and perhaps the German language, whichshows some indications of becoming 
as much the language of Protestant theology as Latin is of the Roman Catholic. 
At Yale it is noted that Sanserit may be studied under Prof. Whitney, of the 
ollege proper. Of the twelve or thirteen schools reporting optional courses 
in the languages with which Hebrew is cognate but two mention inaddition the 
study of the hieroglyphics. One of these, the Theological Seminary of the Dutch 
Reform Church, offers in each of its three years a course in Coptic or Hiero- 
glyphiec, while the other, the theological seminary at Andover, Mass., offers in- 
‘struction to the middle and senior classes in Egyptology, including the elements 
of the hieroglyphs, or in Assyriology. The course of the schools then, taking 
them altogether, is well confined to the languages of the Semitic group, with a 
preference for the northern branch, as might be expected from the religious lit- 
erature its languages contain, though the study*of the ancient or Bibiical He- 
brew should not be classed among the optional studies of our seminaries. 
‘The following statements will illustrate various phases of the course of instruc- 
tion in the optional languages: : 
    1.—As to organization of the classes. 
    
  ‘THE COGNATE ORIENTAL LANGUAGES AT UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. 
(See page 933 for time table.) 
All the studies in this department are optional. 
The class in Biblical Aramaic will study the grammar of that language with 
selections from the Aramaic of the Bible. in the second term, with Prof. Brown. 
‘Those who have already studied Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic may unite with 
the Syri ‘iac and Arabic classes, which are organized in alternate years (1889-90, 
Syriac; 1890-91, Arabic), so that in regular order the three classes may pursue 
Biblical Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic. The Syriac class will study Syriac gram- 
mar, and read selections ‘from the Peshitto version in the first term, and read 
selections from Bar-Hebracus and Ephraem Syrus in the second term with Prof, 
Briggs. The Arabic class will study the Arabic grammar. and read selections 
from the version of Saadia in the first term, and read selections from the Koran, 
in connection with a more particular study of Arabic syntax, in the second term 
with Prof. Briggs. 
There willbe two ») Assyrian classes, composed of those who have einen studied 
Hebrew, and two of the Cognates. "The one will study the Assyrian characters 
and grammar, and: read selections from the historical inscriptions during the 
second term with Prof. Brown. The second class will consist of those who have 
already passed through the first class. They will read selections from the his- 
torical and mythological inscriptions and the syllabaries. Lectures will also be 
given on Babylonian and Assyrian literature, and on the history of the Assyrian 
language and the cuneiform signs. This course will be extended through both 
terms with Prof. Brown.

Comparative Semitic and Septuagint Greek.—In 1890, and every second year, 
class will be formed in the Greek of the Septuagint with special reference to the — 
influence of the vocabulary and grammar of that important version upon the New 
Testament Greek. In 1891, and every second year, a class will make a beg! 
ning in comparative Semitic grammar by reading comparatively the first four 
chapters of Genesis in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic; 40 hours, = 
At the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, whose peculiar ity of inde- 
pendence of schools has been noted, ‘twelve collateral studies, previously irreg: 
ularly pursued in private classes, have been organized into definite specialties 
_ for resident or under-graduates. The first four of these schools deal with Ara- 
: bic, Aramaic, Assyrian, and the Coptic languages, but it is of the sixth, the 
a ecrenin, and the twelfth that mention is made here. The sixth course is in Pa~ 
tristic Greek, and during the year ‘‘ The Teaching of the’ Twelve Apostles” — 
_ and portions ‘of Justin Martyr, etc., were-read. The eighth course is in Pa 
tristic and scholastic Latin, with readings in Tertullian, Augustine, Bede’s His 
tory, and the Imitation of Christ. The twelfth course deals with German, as is”. 
shown by the following: & 
Theological German.—The importance of the German language is appreciated : 
by numbers of students in theology. A special class has been regularly organ- 
ized for beginners ; advanced students who shall prosecute with the professor a — 
_ course of reading in German works of exegesis, church history, systematic cr — 
practical theology, will in the future be entitled to a diploma for attainmen‘s ii 
- this course. The j junior class for the present year has mastered the forms ae 
read considerably in the New Testament. The senior class has read largely n 
the Old Testament. 
» - At the School of Theology of Boston University Spee is an optional study 
for those intending to labor among Spanish-American’ populations. The 
struction is given in this as in a number of other studies in the College of Lib- 
eral Artsof the University. The same advantages are offered at Yale and other: 
seminaries which are university departments. Third year.

L024 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
POST GRADUATE courses. 
Postgraduate work is individual, and when such students are congregated into 
classes their work is but the work of the seminarium. A fourth year of work 
was established at the Andover Seminary as early as 1858, but only survived for 
ashort pericd. In 1881 it was again established and on a firm basis. 
FOREIGN DEPARTMENTS. 
When George Primrose, the son of Goldsmith’s Vicar of Wakefield, went to 
Holland to teach the natives English he found his purpose frustrated by his in- 
ability to speak Dutch. It has long been found necessary to teach the mission- 
ary to the Indian the language of those among whom he isto labor and even to send 
out native preachers, and quite an effort has been made by several schools during 
the last decade to educate a ministry that is to deal with our foreign populations. 
This effort is not only Christian and denominational but patriotic. At the Old 
German Theological School of Newark (Presbyterian) it is held as afundamental 
principle that ‘‘to reach any powerful body of foreign people in a large way 
there must be a native ministry springing from among the people themselves. 
In view of the great power of the German people in this land it is wise to con- 
cede the German language during the period of transition. Suecess in German 
churches among adult Germans by ministers preaching exclusively in the En- 
_ glish tongue is exceptional, depends on special individual genius, and can not be 
depended upon for a general system of evangelization. * * * In order to bring 
_ the German mind—educated through a long history so entirely different from 
_ our own—into sympathy with our doctrine and practice, a rightly devised and 
wisely conducted indoctrination of the German mind is necessary. * * * The 
instruction should be in both languages. * * * The graduate as an individ- 
ual should gravita’e towards the German flock, the pastor and flock as a mass 
should gravitate towards the American life: x * * The practical effect of 
the education of German ministers by our established American theological 
seminaries has been to educate the student away from the German people, thus 
- gaining the individual pastor but losing the flock.” 
_ The German Baptist churches in America, according to the Rochester Theo- 
logical Seminary, were, in 1850, only 10 in number’ and, as their number in- 
creased many young men of mature years felt themselves called upon to preach 
the gospel to their countrymen, and the course of the German department, es- 
tablished many years ago,was arranged to suit their scholasticattainments. The 
course of instruction is subject to modification, according to the needs of the 
_ students. The study of the English language does not cease with the second 
year, but is continued by attendance at many of the lectures and other exercises 
of the English’ department. The course of instruction, now extended to six 
years, is divided into two parts; first, a preparatory or academic course, em- 
bracing the three lower classes; and, secondly, the theological course proper, 
embracing the three higher classes. Students in these higher classes not in- 
frequently continue at the same time their academic studies. 
_ To meet “manifest and growing needs” the German department of the Chi- 
cago Theological Seminary was opened in 1882, the Dano-Norwegian in 1884, 
and the Swedish in 1885. ‘The German department i is in close connection with 
the German Seminary at Crete, Nebr., and has already received students from 
it. The Swedish department has the approv! alof many of the Swedish churches 
in this country. both among those which are independent and tliose which be- 
long to the ‘ forbundet.’ The Dano- -Norwegian department has no ecclesiastical 
connections. It originated in the suggestion of a banker in Chicago, a Nor- 
-wegian by birth, who has rendered it pecuniary aid.” These foreign sections of 
the school are thus described : 
The departments are under the charge of able and judicious teachers of high 
Christian character, graduates of foreign universities. The instruction given 
to the students in these departments is similar to that of the special [English] 
course, and it is expected that they will, as far as possible, attend lectures in 
the middle and senior years with the regular classes. It is required, also, that 
all foreign Students shall take at least two exercises a week each year in their 
own languages. They are allowed to omit in the English course, in the first 
year, homiletics and natural theology; in the second year, Old Testament in- 
troiuction; and in the third year, pastoral theology. They have an equiva- 
‘lent for these studies in their own languages. Insiruction in English is given

Seminary. x 
The Slavic department of the Oberlin Seminary was opened at the instance of 
the officers of the American Home Missionary Society, and has for its object the 
training of young men of Slavic descent for missionary work among their coun- 
trymen in the United S‘ates. The course of study now occupies three years, and 
is pursued in English and Bohemian. In Bohemian, the students are taught by a 
native teacher the correct us2of the language, and are drilled in the prepara- 
tion and delivery of such addresses as are likely to be required of them. Tae 
students for this department are obtained threugh the instrumentality of the | 
- superintendent of missionary work among the Slavic people. 
Quite as near to national sympathy, and, in acertain sense, still more deserving 
of it, are the descendants of those who occupied the territory now covered by a 
European civilization and also of those who were brought here for the purpose of 
being sold into perpetual slavery. An interpretation of the Constitution ' has 
made the Indiana peculiar kind of foreigner in our imperium, and an amend- 
ment to the Constitution has made the negro a member of our body politic. 
The General Government cares for and educates the first, while the other has boen 
launched into the struggle for existence without further provision than the con- 
stitutional provision referred to, and an education in the public schools of his 
native State. The improvement effected in the social condition end enlighten- 
ment of these two races is largely, if not entirely, due to religious enthusiasm. 
\ There is not an American denomination of wealth or power that has not distin- 
guished itself in this work, and it would be invidious to make distinction further 
than to say that the Protestant churehes have operated largely in the South as 
well as in the West, and that the Roman Catholic Church has also been em- 
inently successful in missionary work among the Indians. 
If we bear in mind the injunction of the German Theological School and the prac- © 
tice of the foreign departments of certain seminaries, one Indian school espe- 
ciaily calls for our attention. The Santee Normal Training School was estab- 
lished in 1870 for the purpose of educating native teachers, preachers, inter- 
preters, and business men for the Dakota or Sioux Nation. The great object of 
the work is to prepare a native agency which shall work the regeneration of a 
race ‘‘ which is so thoroughly controlled in all their ideas and customs by their 
own religion that no change of life is possible except through the substitution of 
another.” Hence, while the students are fitted for citizenship, care is taken 
to maintain their common interest in, and sympathy with, their own race. 
This gives law to the methods and makes it needful to use two languag s' in 
,order to make the student a competent instructor among his own people. The 
very idea of education had to be planted in the Indian mind, says Dr. Riggs, the 
principal. The following are the studies pursued:

   ~The language of the American negro being English and as he is no longer 
-@ heathen, the scope of instruction of the colored theological school is to 
lows that the course in a majority of the theological institutions or depart- 
ments is very simple, being confined inits religious branches to the study of the 
Bible and of church history. Of the seminary type, however, is the course the 
Gammon Theological Seminary and that of the theological department of Howard 
University. In both, however, Hebrew and Greek are optional. In regard to 
the course in these languages the dean of the latter institution informs the Bu- 
_reau that they are ‘‘for those who have had the advantages of a college educa- 
tion. Most of the students take the English course of study.” 
In closing this subject, which might as well have been headed “‘ missionary” 
as ‘‘foreign departments,” a project of the Boston University to enlarge the usual 
missionary department into a distinct course, is to be mentioned. In its scien- 
tific aspect the course might be called a department of the philosophy and com- 
parison of religions with special reférence to missionary labor. Assketched the 
course is of three years. = 
CHAIRS ON THE RELATION OF SCIENCE TO RELIGION, 
One of the results of the conflict between science and those who believe in 
revealed religion appears to be the foundation and endowment of new chairs in 
our theological seminaries, with the view of studying the matter, which may 
be considered, in military parlance, as carrying the war into Africa. The theo- 
ogical seminary at Columbia, S.C.,has a Perkins, professor of natural science 
in connection with revelation and Christian apologetics; the seminary at 
Princeton, N. J., has a Stuart, professor of the relations of philosophy and 
science to the Christian religion; the San Francisco Seminary has a Montgom- 
ry professor of apologetics and missions, while the seminary at Oberlin 
has a Douglass lectureship on the relations of science and religion, and 
on comparative religion. The scope of this instruction, as might be ex- 
pected, is very intimately connected with apologetics. At least this is the case 
4 the Columbia (S.C.) Seminary, whose course in the department of natural 
cience, inconnection with revelation and Christian apologetics, is concerned 
in its first year, with the philosophy or basis of religion, in its second with 
comparative religion, or the study of the forms in which theism has manifested 
itself, and in its third year with the connection of science with revelation. Of 
aless apologetic nature from the standpoint of Christianity as a revealed re- 
ligion and more related to the science of religions, if such a term-be allowed, is 
the comparative study of the religions of the world. The great enterprise of 
Oxford in publishing the sacred books of Oriental peoples, the remarkable in- 
terpretations of Greek, Roman, and Teutonic mythology and folklore, arevival, 
it would seem, of the exegesis of later Hellenic writers,’ the work of Sanskrit 
~ scholars, Egyptologists, and Assyriologists in France, Germany, and England, 
have created an enthusiasm in the direction of inquiry into the scientific basis 
of theism that has forced its way into the professional schools of Christian 
theology, though the study is apologetic only so far as it brings: out in strong 
relief the religion of the peoples of Europe against the background furnished by 
_ the religions of the conservative peoples of the Orient. The work of the Divin- 
ity School of Boston University will illustrate a course in— 
_ _ Comparative theology.—Introduction to the history of religion, comparative 
theology, and the philosophy of religion ; special examination of the Chaldzo- 
Assyrian, the Egyptian, Persian, Indo-Aryan, Chinese, Greek, and Teutonic 
religions ; comparative cosmology and mythical geography of the most ancient 
nations ; essaysand discussions. 
The courses of the Presbyterian seminaries.at Princeton and San Francisco 
_ are more particularly concerned as yet with theism and anti-theistic theories. 
_| The Princeton course does not seem to be definitely fixed. The dean of the’ 
_ Ryder Divinity School of Lombard University informs the Bureau that the 
course of that school gives prominence to the relations subsisting between 
science and religion. The course of the department of the seminary at Co- 
_ lumbia, S. C., is given in full.

- by means of lectures and recitations. No 
_ text-books are prescribed, but books of ref- 
erence are recommended. . Oral and written 
exercises are regularly required in the class 
room. Each year a course of lectures is given to 
the several classes in the seminary. In these 
courses the ground of Christian apologetics is 
covered ina general way. In all the courses 
attention is directed to the scientific aspects of the various topics under discussion; and 
during the senior year special attention is 
given to the relations of natural science and 
revelation.

SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES OF APPLIED SCIENCE, 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION. 
The colleges and departments endowed with the national land grant of 1862 
may be divided into two classes when taken with reference to their requirements 
of admission. One class—not quite half of the whole number—is composed of 
those who require nothing more than proficiency in the studies of the gram- 
mar grade of the public schools, while the other class requires in addition the 
elements of algebra and geometry. In several cases, however, algebra to quad- 
ratic equations and plane geometry are deemed sufficient, while in one case, to 
algebra and geometry completed is added trigonometry. Botany, chemistry, or 
physics is required in several schools and in one Latin and in another French. 
As about half of the schools have preparatory departments, it would see1 that 
any deficiency on the part of the candidate might there be made good before he 
“entered upon his course in the collegiate department. The arrangement of the 
University of Minnesotain this respect is unique; ithasapreparatory department, 
but even that is an agricultural course. In the catalogue for 1891-92 the reasons 
for the institution of two agricultural courses are given with considerable force, 
as follows: fe 
‘‘Observation and experience have shown that all the facilities afforded by the 
regular colleges of the country for agricultural education have failed to attract 
any large number of farmers’ sons. The requirements for admission are such 
as to compel the boy to leave home for one or two years to secure such prepara- 
tion, and this, together with the four years necessary to complete a full course, 
entails an expenditure of time and money which comparatively few can afford, 
and the education thus received, while valuable in itself, fails in many respects 
to furnish the training and knowledge needed by young men for the practical: 
duties of the farm. In order to meet this want the board of regents of the uni- 
versity has established a ‘‘ school of agriculture” with a full equipment of build- 
ings and instructors on the experiment farm, where students live, work, and 
study during the three years devoted to this department. * * * Students 
will be received without examination in subjects on which they can furnish the 
certificates of high schools or of county superintendents.” 
Graduates of ths School of Agriculture are admitted to the college. In the 
catalogue above cited the number of students in the College of Agviculture is 
given as 5, all freshmen; in the School of Agriculture, 104. In two or three in- 
stitutions ashorter course is provided, generally of two years, which serves the 
purros: of the school of agriculture of the Minnesota University. 
Turning now to the technological schools not endowed with land grant the 
same subjects are required as in the case of the schools endowed with the land 
grant. At the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard, the John C. Green 
School of Princeton, the Chandler Scientific School of Dartmouth, the Towne 
Scientific School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Polytechnic School 
- of Washington University, and the Lehigh University, it is no: surprising that 
the requirements in mathematics should be uniformly high; but the distin- 
guishing feature between the school attached to a school of belles lettres and 
the isolated institution for the benefit of agriculture ‘and the mechanic arts is 
the demand for literary culture, as shown by the requirement of a foreign lan- 
guage by the departments of colleges and universities. The Sheffield School 
of Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology show the same charac- 
teristic as the nonendowed departments justnamed. Cornell, endowed with the 
national land grant, does not require a foreign language in the preliminary ex- 
amination unless the candidate enters for a degree. 
There is a requirement of the Lawrence Scientific School that merits atten-! 
tion. In physics the candidate is examined ‘‘ either in (1) astronomy (Lock- 
yer's elementary lessons) and physics (Avery’s elements of natural philosophy 
or Gaye’s elements of physics); or (2) a Gourse of experiments in the subjects of 
mechanics, sound, light, heat, and electricity, not less than forty in number, 
actually performed at school by the pupil. These experiments may be selected 
from A.M. Worthington’s Physical Laboratory Practice orfrom the ‘New Phys- 
ies,’ by John Trowbridge, or from any similar laboratory manual.” 
_ Literary astronomy and physics call for no particular mention, but a course 
of forty experiments in the subjects of mechanics, sound. light, heat, and elec- 
tricity, actually performed atthe school by the pupil, isan important innovation. 
The principal difficulty in the way of this kind of instruction has been very 
ably expressed by Prof. Trowbridge, of Harvard, in the preface to“his ‘‘New 
Physics,” as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
      : CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. — 945 
“The teacher may grant the comparatively small result which is obtained 
_ from the study of physics by the method of lectures and recitations; but he will 
immediately ask, ‘How can we obtain the time for laboratory work in physics— 
crowded as weare with so many studies?’ Moreover, the subject of physics is 
unlike that of chemistry or botany. In these subjects the cost of the apparatus 
and material is comparatively small.” 
- It would be interesting to know how many of those applying for admission to 
Harvard have availed themselves of this election, but efforts to ascertain the 
fact have failed.* at 
In almost every school there is a ‘‘ formal” examination for admission. 
The selection of the beneficiary varies considerably among the institutions en- 
dowed with the land grant. In some cases it is the county judge, court, or su- 
perintendent that selects the pupil, in others the appointment is in the hands 
of the members of the legislature, and sometimes the selection is made by means 
of acompetitive examination. In the Georgia School of Technology there is a 
scholarship for every member of the House of Representatives, filled by com- 
petitive examination. The State board of education fills the scholarship at the 
‘Worcester Free Institute, and the city school board of Philadelphia the 31 city 
scholarships of the Towne Scientific School of the University of Pennsylvania.

COURSE IN CIVIL ENGINEERING, 
Perhaps the only thing that is absolutely agreed upon as an essential for the 
successful practice of the profession of ,civil engineering is a general culture of 
the mind. For it seems to be thought that this general culture will give the 
ability of forming general ideas and of speculating upon things, the prerequi- 
sites of a scientific method.” 
The conception of Gen. Thayer in founding the postgraduate school of Dart- 
mouth College, which bears his name, as to what this general culture should be 
wasmore technical. He required for admission knowledge of mathematics that 
could only be obtained at a college or a high class technological school, and the 
pupil when once entered upon the course of study has his attention confined to 
“surveying in general,” ‘construction in general,” and special applications. 
(See Table A.) ’ 
The civil engineering course of other American high-class technological 
schools is arranged upon an entirely different plan, being, in a word, a com- 
promise. Instead of the two years of concentrated work on this specialty as at 
the Thayer school, the compromise course is lengthened to four years, its ad- 
mission requirements are lowered to admit the high school graduate, and the 
first two years of the course are partly given to laying a foundation for general 
culture and partly for a specialty. 
Turning to Europe adifferent condition of affairs isshown. In Germany there 
are 10 technical universities, called generically the Technishe Hochschulen. Ad- 
mission to these technical universities is obtained under the same condition as 
that to the literary institutions called universities, the possession of the Reife- 
zeugniss of a gymuasium or of a realgymnasium. An examination of the pro- 
gramme of the civil engineering course of the Technical University of Hanover 
given in Table B will show that nothing of a literary nature is there taught, ° 
for the general culture of the intellect is supposed to have been accomplished 
by the course in the gymnasium and to be certified to by the certificate of ma- 
turity or Reifezeugniss, which gives the student admittance to the university. 
What that general culture is will be shown by the courses of the Gymnasien, 
which are given beside the civil engineering course of the technical university. 
It is perhaps too much to say that the course of these Gymnasien is equal to 
the course of our colleges; ‘but the programmes that follow fully explain them- 
selves. (Table B.) 
  
1At a recent meeting the Association of Colleges in New England “invited the attention of 
the public” to the advisability of making the following change“in the programme of the New 
‘England grammar schools: “2. The introduction of elementary physics into the later years of the programme as a sub- 
- stantial subject to be taught by the experimental or laboratory method and to include exact 
weighing and measuring by the pupils themselves.”

The course of civil engineering in France is best illustrated by the programme of — 
_ the celebrated “Schosl of Bridges and Roads” (Tab.e C). With that logic ior 
waich the French are-noted the instruction of an engineer is a seriesof interde- — 
_ pendent courses in three diiierent schools. The first of these, the lye e, 
_ eerresponds to the German gymnasium as an institution of culture, though 
_ in its internal arrangements it bears a pretty close resemblance to our coileges 
‘that have a course in the ancient languages, a Latin scientific course, and also 
an English scientifie course. Onthecontrary inthe Germancollege or gymnas- 
ium one, and only one, curriculum is followed, in the realgymnasium, or gymna- 
sium without Greek there is also only one course, and in the realschu’e, which Las 
neither La‘in or Greek, the same unity prevails. Thus the Germans have «sepa- 
rate school for each separate curriculum. Butin France the gymnasium and the 
-realschule are contained in the same institution, the course corresponding to the 
~- gymnasium iscalled l’enseignemeni classique, and that correspcnding tother al- * 
_ schule is called l’enseignement special, while to supply the place fillei by the 
_ rea gymnasium in the German system the enseignement classique has. after the 
completion of the third class, an enseignement scientifique daas les classes de 
mathématiques (instruction insciencein the mathematicalclasses). Mathematics — 
- hasever been considered in France as fully entitled to be called.ascience as physics | 
is, though in translating the programme the writer has adopted the fash‘on of Eng- 
‘lish programmes. Thus in France‘in thesame school, the lycée, there are three 
- concurrent curriculums. But it is only the mathematical classes that are to be 
Considered here. : z 
Now, it is customary for thoze students who intend to enter upon a course of 
instruc ion under a Faculty of Scienc2s or upon the course of the military school 
at St. Cyr, to take the first two years of Division of Science, called, respec- 
tively, the preparatory and the elementary class of science. Having finished 
the siudies of these two years, the degree of Bachelor of Science is conferred.’ 
But for, those who desire to enter the school for preparing teachers for the 
lycée (Ecole Normale Supérieure), or those who desire to enter the quasi mili- 
tary Beole Polytechnique, a more extended knowledge of mathem:tics is re- 
‘quired, which is given in a class called special mathematics. The Kcole Poly- 
technique is the second cours2 in the education of the French engineer, but its” 
_ course is concerned with unapplicd science. ‘The course formsa great physico- ~ 
_ mathematical encyclopedia, the instruction there given is a general instruction 
destined to develop the scientific mind and to furnisa each pupil with the tool 
that later on will serve him when engaged in personal work. In a word, the 
school neither produces engineers nor oflicers. Its rdle is at once more elevated 
and more modest; it wholly consists in preparing students for spscial schools 
whose business is to make engineers and officers. It is at the artillery school, 
at the naval school, ete., during two years, and at the schools of bridges and 
roads, and of mines during three years, that technical instruction is given.”*

In addition to the general course given above, the curriculum comprehends the study of the 3 
German and English languages. In each division the students are exercised in practical work, — 
to wit, graphic representation, drawing, water color, manipulation and tests of building ma-— 
terial. leveling and drawing plans, drawing engines and buildings. They draw up plans for 
construction. 
These courses comprise the normal instruction of the school, but in addition there are regu- 
lar conferences upon telegraphic construction, photography, management of railroads, and “ 
fish-culiure. There are also other conferences whenever a discovery or the prosecution of 
some great work demands it. 
The school possesses an experimental shop, where the students attend upon a series of opera- 
tions and practical experiments, 
Having thus attempted to give some idea of a course in civil engineering both at 
home and abroad: we may Vv! enture toexamine alittle more closely the character 
this.course in the schools of the United States that have been endowed by national 
or by private munificence for the purpose of benefiting agriculture and the me- 
chanic arts. This term, civil engineering, we are told by ‘the faculty of the Rose — 
Polytechnic Institute. is somewhat vague. Sometimes it means land- -surveying, | 
sometimes topographical mapping, and often railroad construction. In the Rose | 
Polytechnic it means ‘‘all these and more.” Let us use the catalogue of this — 
school, then, not only for this reason, but because, l-aving out of consideration 
the catalogue of the Technical High School (University) of Hanover and of other — 
German states or provinces, and the catalogue of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, it is among the most thoroughly and ably prepared catalogues that 
are in the files of the Bureau. 
Tae details of the purely civil engineering in the Rose Polytechnic part of 
the course are exhibited in the schedule below. The complete course in civil 
engineering will be shown by subs.ituting the several blocks of this schedule 
for the “ shop practice” of the general course in mechanical engineering.* Ss

Having now obtained what we want, that is to say, the details of a purely 
technical course of civil engineering, it is useless to encumber the page with 
other courses. In examining the above courses the reader observes that the first 
year is wholly or almost wholly devoted to preparatory study and the techno- 
logical work does not begin until the second year; for during the preparatory year 
algebra, geometry, trigonometry, chemistry, or physics, and the mother tongue 
or another language are studied. He also will observe that during the remain- 
ing three years (those represented in the above schedules) no mention is made 
of “geometrical and mechanical or of free-hand drawing, or of that species of 
drawing called descriptive geometry. Topographical and ‘‘ railroad” drawing, 
map-drawing, and’plane table surveying, etc., occur, but nothing is said of the 
general kinds of delineation, whether free-hand or mathematical. It must not 
be supposed, however, that general mathematical delineation ceases to be a sub- 
ject of instruction in the two schools whose courses are represented. At the 
Rose Polytechnic mechanical drawing is given throughout the second and third 
years and descriptive geometry during the second year. At the Massachusetts 
Institute five hours a week for fifteen weeks of the second year, first term, are oc- 
cupied with descriptive geometry. 
mathematics. It is the same with language and the higher ~ 
They are not treated as an integral part cf civil enineering, 
~ though studied concurrently by the students of the course in civil engineering. 
So strictly is the connotation of the term civil engineering observed at the Mas- 
sachusetts Institute of Technology that not only pure, but even applied ma- 
thematics are considered as coérdinate departments with that of civil engi- 
neering. The scheme of the department of applied mathematics at that school 
is therefore given.

  It is évident that the schedules of the American Gains do not give all the 
work performed ; and it is necessary to obtain this by special inquiry. A pre=- 
paratory step to such an inquiry was made in the form ior 1389-90, sent out by this 
Bureau in Jum, 1390, its object, however, being to ascertain what courses had 
been introduced and were being followed in our technological institutions, an 
the duration and character of such cour; ses. All these face's should be brougat 
out, itis thought, by the following schem3 thouzh the time devoted toeach course, ~

through such an undertaking. In June, 1891, the question represented by Table 
_D. was sent out by the Bureau. The results of that inquiry are tabulated as 
they have been returned. Neither the question of 1889-90 nor that for 1890-91 
was made with the ambitious design of showing statistically the history and 
- condition of the engineering courses. Indeed, the Bureau was under the im- 
pression that such facts could not be obtained with sufficient fullness by the or- 
_ dinary means of distributing circulars, and it was not prepared to formulate its 
desires until a study,of the answers to the questions on its form and of the an- 
‘nual catalogues of the schools had shown that the time had come when such an 
inguiry .would give fully satisfactory results. As said before a technical journal 
~ has undertaken the inquiry, has placed the results in the hands of an expert to 
be edited, and will soon publish them. 
Thus relieved of any scruples in slighting the subject of technological instruc- 
- tion, one may turn to the consideration of a very energetic protest that has been 
_ eaused by the question which forms the several headings of the following Table D. 
The point to which the Bureau would call special attention isexpressed as follows: _ 
‘This question [all the headings of Table D], although itcan be readily and fairly 
_ answered by some and perhaps many of the land-grant colleges, isso unsuited to 
our methods that even with the best intentions I see no way of fairly and hon- 
estly answering it in figures alone.”. In the case of the institution thus spoken 
- of the question served its purpose. For years past the following colleges, en- 
 dowed with the proceeds of the act of 1862 for the benefit of agriculture and the 
mechanical arts, have found it impossible to separate their technical work from 
~ that of their technical departments and have elected to be considered as colleges 
of letters rather than of technology:

= SHEFFIELD SCIENTIFIC SCHOOL OF YALE UNIVERSITY, 
New Haven, October 24, 1891. 
Commissioner of Education, Washington, D. C.: 
_ DBAR Sir: In the absence of President Dwight the inclosed schedule has been 
placed in-my hands to answer. I have spent some considerable time in trying 
to answer the questions as fully and as correctly as is possible: but the fact is 
that several of the more prominent ones can not (or ought not) be answered in 
the shape they are asked. Some can not be answered because of the way our 
school is organized as a department of this university, or because of the compli- 
cations incident to its age, and others ought not, because, if answered according 
to the schedule, the bare figures tell but part of the truth, and if tabulated 
along with answers to the same questions from certain other institutions, are 
misleading, a thing I know you wish to avoid. 
   
-P-A-G-E-365
      
CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 957 
The truth but half told may be as misleading as a positive falsehood, and is 
~much harder to meet and explain when made use of as an argumentin discussion 
or criticism. Some very bitter criticism$ and many unjust charges have been 
brought against sundry of the land-grant colleges in the last few years, based 
nominally upon statistics. In most of these cases the statistics were unfair, if 
not positively false, in that the figures used either told but part of the truth or 
else meant different things when applied to contrasting colleges having different 
systems of classification or different methodsof instruction. Several prominent — 
institutions, North, South, East and West, have suffered from this and I think 
that few have entirely escaped. The fact that these colleges have suffered so 
much more in that respect than classical institutions I believe to be in part due 
to the nature of the statistics put forth, in which things essentially unlike are 
classed together, or things alike are called by different names. Iam sure that 
you do not mean to help along this evil. 
The land-grant colleges are so very varied in their organization, methods, 
scope, grade, and aims that tables of statistics made from the answers to the 
same questions by the different institutions may be made to show almost any- 
thing the user wants them to show. The answers to your schedule, stated in 
figures alone, mean very different things in the different institutions. a 
I have, therefore, written at more length explanations of some of my answers 
and the causes of my failure to answer others. 
Question 6, [Table D.] This question, although it can be readily and fairly an- ~ 
swered by some, and perhaps many, of the land-grant colleges, is so unsuited to 
our methods that even with the best of intentions [ see of no way of fairly and 
honestly answering it in figures alone. 
Our institution is not so organized that specific figures can be given to these 
questions without being misleading when the figures are used as components of 
statistical tables made out of the reports from several of many institutions. 
Many of the land-grant colleges are so organized that specific figures can be 
given in answer to most of these questions ; ours is not. 
The numerical data given in these tables would be very differently inter- 
preted by different persons studying the figures for unlike objects. Some of 
the figures, even when correct, would tell but part of the truth and be mislead- 
ing, and inferences very unfair to our college could be drawn from them. I 
know you do not wish that kind of statistics. é 
Please let me explain some of the more serious difficulties. First, as to what 
is ‘theory ” and what ‘‘ practice.” When at the Washington meeting of the 
American Association of Agricultural Colleges, in August last, I took pains to 
get the views of a number of the college officers there present on this very mat- 
ter, and I found the interpretation of these terms so very different by the dif- 
ferent teachers consulted that the same facts returned according to your sched- 
ule questions by these different teachers would be very differently tabulated. 
Let me illustrate: 
Mechanical drawing, as taught in these colleges, is certainly ‘‘technical;” it 
is taught in special rooms and with special appliances as truly as is the ‘‘work” 
in the ‘“shops.” Some teachers therefore call it ‘‘ practice,” but others call it 
“theory” and limit the term ‘‘ practice” to ‘‘ shop work ” (done with the tools of 
the mechanic). iS 
Botany and mycology are sciences necessary in teaching scientific agriculture 
or horticulture. They are pursued in specialized laboratories, with special ap- 
pliances, and require skillful technique. Are these scientific studies ‘‘ theoret- 
ical” or ‘‘ practical,” andis this laboratory work ‘‘ theoretical” or ‘‘ practical” 
work ? Some teachers in agriculture call it theoretical, others practical, more 
especially if in mycology. Some call the laboratory work ‘‘ practical work;” 
others limit the use of the term to manual labor on the farm or in the garden, barn, 
or greenhouse. I feel sure that were we to return the hours spent in the draw- 
ing rooms and laboratories by our students in mechanical engineering or our 
students in agriculture as ‘‘ practice,” rather than ‘‘ theory,” many good people 
who know that we have neither farm nor machine shop for manual labor would 
fecl that we had misrepresented things. 
Your section 5 of question 6 relates to ‘applied chemistry.” Does your term 
“practice” include all chemical study pursued by the students in the laboratory ? 
All our undergraduates have such practice, those in engineering during the first 
year only, those in agriculture for two years, those in the chemical course three 
years. In each case it is our way of teaching the science of chemistry, and 
would be called ‘ theoretical” study by most of those who discués ‘ industrial 
education.” To tabulate as ‘‘ practice” the laboratory work done in elementary pe! ; ‘  
-P-A-G-E-366
ae 
EDUCATION REPORT, 
chemistry by our mechanical engincers during their freshman year, would, I 
think, make us liable to the charge of misrepresentation by that large and — 
- earnest class who think that ‘‘ practice” is synonomous with “practical work,” 
ee ‘practical work” means only ‘‘shop work,” or its equivalent, farm 
work. yi 
We have no workshops for teaching the handicraft of the trades, nor land for 
teaching the art of farming. We are, therefore, especially liable to a certain 
- kind of hostile criticism by those who think that the especial function of these — 
institutions is to teach the trades and occupations. The figures derived from ~ 
- our classes, stated in the terms of your schedule, would tell only a part of the 
‘truth, and tell it in such a way as to give a handle for use in unfair criticism 
whichever way we state them. If we donot tabulate all our laboratory work as— 
“practice” we do not conform to your schedule. If we make the figures in- 
_ clude, as “practice” in the technological courses, all our laboratory work, it 
makes it look as if we were doctoring the figures for the purpose of making our 
course seem less ‘‘ theoretical” and we want to avoid the appearance of dodzing 
these questions. We believe our method isa good and sound one and are willing 
_ that it stand squarely upon its merits. : 
‘Again, as to the “hours a week devoted to.” In our system of instruction, 
except for recitations and,lectures, we measure little by hours. We have nota 
_ single ‘requisition which can be ‘‘made up” or ‘‘worked off” in any speciiied 
number of hours. 
There is a minimum of work which a student must do before he can get a de- 
gree. But this is not measured by the number of hours spent in the class room 
‘or laboratory although a record is keptof attendance and any considerable irreg- 
ularity is not tolerated. 
A pet idea in our system and methods is to give each and every student a 
- chance to do his best, to encourage acquisition by work rather than to consume 
time by the hour. The facilities qf our class rooms and: laboratories and the 
division of the claszes into sections are in accordance with this idea and largely di- 
‘rected to this ond. The laboratories are open much beyond the times of **re- 
“quired” attendance. The minimum requisition for a degree does not represent 
-in any sense the number of hours devoted per week to any subject. So far as 
-hours represent anything, it is the minimum attendance of the very poorest 
student whoultimately graduates. Consequently, we have never yet compiled and 
published, even for our own use, a complete tabulated statement of the number 
of hours per week required for all the various sections of this school other than 
the regular programme of daily exercises.. Such atable might be made, but if we 
made it, it would be with the understanding that it was for the lowest possible 
grade of work allowed. 
Again, the Sheffield Scientific School isa department of the university in 
__ which department none of the students are pursuing a classical or merely liter- 
ary course in the sens» in which these terms are used in classical colleges. Yet 
I think that it would be untrue as well as misleading to class them all as ‘‘ tech- 
nological” students, although everyone is pursuing some of the studies classed ~ | 
_ as technical in the great majority of the land-grant colleges. 
I have given the figures which are called for in the last column, but when tab- 
ulated along with the figures frommany other colleges, as from Cornell, forexam-~ 
' ple, are very misieading. In Cornell, and, I think, all those colleges where there is 
also a classical course, the technical and scientific courses are distinct or recog- 
nized from the very entrance. Here the siudies are the same forall our stu- 
dents during the freshman year. The classes here do not differentiate into 
courses until the beginning of the second year, therefore the numbers I have 
given include only those in the last two years. They do not include the 137 un- 
dergraduates who are not officially in the courses specified, although they are 
purusing the studies required as a part of the technical courses. Nor does it in- 
clude the 29 graduate students who are pursuing the higher studies supple- 
mental to the undergraduate courses. The total is therefore smaller by over 
160 than the same’students would be tabulated in most of the colleges. = 
z I have gone at length into this question, and I think you will see the force of 
_ the difficulties and the importance of the matter, especially in these times, when 
so many of these institutions are being made the subject of sensational criticism 
and hostile attack. 
Question 8, (#) This is no State appropriation but the income from the fund 
derived from the land grant of 1862. The State still holds that, paying us only 
the income. We receive no State appropriation. (6) This is as it appears from 
_ the books of the college treasurer.

Question 9, No part of this question can be satisfactorily answered. I will re- 
- markoenthe three items. = . : 
-. (a) The Sheffield Scientific School is but a department of the university, and 
all of its instruction was carried on in buildings belonging to “The Pr s dent 
and -ellowsof Yale College” for the first twenty-five year's of itsexistence. Now, — 
three large and several small buildings are used by this department,exclusiyely, — 
but much of the instruction goes on in buildings whose use is shared by other 
. departments of the nae A:part.of the drawing is taught in the Street 
~ - Art School; geology, mineralogy, paleontology, and zojlegy in the Peabody M 
seum which contains the university collections belonging to these sciences. Then, 
too, the university library, gymnasium, reading roon, etc., ctc.,are used by our 
students in common wiih the rest of the university., To include all these in the — 
property of the Sheffield Scientific School would be untrue and would grossly 
overrate its riches and possessions. On the other hand, to leave them all out 
would be to. uniruthiully underrate its facilities for instruction. Asa part of 
the university, this school gets move or less benefit of all the varied possessions 
which constitute the material part of the university, the ownership of which is — 
peculiarly complicated. They represent the growth of two centuries. Of the 
buildings in our exclusive use, two were originally built for other purposes, and 
later adapted to our use. I have never seen any Suigniary. of the grounds and — 
buildings of the university, as a whole, nor any attempt to estimate what the 
value of those of our department would be without the others. 
_ (b) The same is true of apparatus and collections; some belong to the Scien-' — 
tifie School especially and some belong to the University. I am not aware that — 
any attempt at an invéntory has ever been made, and any estimate would be but 
arude guess. The collections are largely the collecticns of the University and 
represent the accumulations of about a century. The apparatus in the exclu- 
sive use of the Scientific School represent the accumulation of about fifty years. 
, A set equivalent to the latter could probably be got together for $40,000, but it 
» cost originally very much more than that.. Some of it now has merély a histori- 
eal or sentimental value, hard to estimate in money, yet it has still an educar 
tional value. : : 
(c) ‘* Productive funds.” Here the answer is still more difficult, as it is more 
complicated. Some belong to the Scientific School, some to the University, a 
portion is for special purposes, others for general purposes. We now have the © 
income of some university funds, which we may not have when certain univer- 
sity instruction is given in some other way. We have some funds of our own; 
weshare in the use of others for general university uses; “we share in still o'her 
special endowments; andany statement we might make would bea mater of boo 
keeping rather than an exhibit of the capital of the Sheffield Scientific Schoo 
‘The treasurer’s report gives the names and status of the various funds, but of 
some of these funds, even he does not attempt to decide whether they should — 
be considered in this schedule as belonging to *‘ The Sheffield Scientifie Schooi” 
om‘ Yale College” or “ Yale University.” They are in the possessicn of the 
‘Yale corporation for certain uses.. The University can apply the income for in- 
struction or use in the department which it thinks fulfills most nearly the objects ~ 
intended by thedonor. I have spent some time with the treasurer trying to 
compile satisfactory answers, but I can not answer either division of this ques-— 
tion in a way that will be both truthful and satisfactory, or that will show the 
money value of the educational plant we have here. For asolution we woud — 
have to go away back to colonial times for a part, and the -answers are compli- 
cated in a great variety of ways. i 
Question 10. This refers to the special library inthe school. This department 
shares in all the use and facilities of the university library, hence there is no at-_ 
tempt to make a large collection of books of our own; most of our books are to 
supplement those in the main library, or else those needed in the laboratories, —

II. 
COURSE IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. 
The instrument of the civil engineer is the transit and his sphere of practice 
the open country, but the instr uument of the mechanical engineer is the hammer 
and his place.is in the shop. The Roman roads and aqueducts are standing evi- 
dences of the skill of the Roman people, the pyramids and Lake Moeris testify 
to the ability of the Egyptian engineer, and the cathedrals of France to that of 
- the master masons of the Middle Ages, but an ‘industrial revolution” waited 
for the invention of a steam engine that was something more than a curiosity or 
atoy. This industrial revolution may be said to have reached its majority, so 
to speak, about the middle of the present century, at least in England, where from 
peculiar circumstances it found acongenialsoil. Progress in industry, however, 
must not be confounded with progress in that kind of industrial education which 
is given in schools. Neither the Greek literary and artistic genius nor the En- 
glish industrial and political genius was born within the walls of an educational 
edifice. But when a nation has manifested its genius it is possible and desira- 
ble to have persons study the manifestations of that genius, formulate and teach 
the results, and thus mechanically a naturally less gifted or enterprising nation 
is elevated to a stage of culture in which the less gifted nation may reap the 
same intellectual or material benefits the more gifted enjoy. 
In 1855, at the time of the reorganization of the Rensselaer Institute, a depart- 
ment of ‘* ‘Mechanics, Machines, and Constructions” was established in the school, 
with a set of text-books printed mostly in Paris and London, and in two cases in 
Germany, but there was no course leading to a degree in mechanical engineer- 
ing, the instruction in that art being a part of the course in civil and mining 
engineering. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1864 there was in 
the fourth year a course of mechanical engineering separate from the civil engi- 
neering course after the close of the third year. At the School of Mines of Co- 
lumbia College, New York City, ‘‘a course of machines which is essential in a 
course of mining engineering” was given, about 1864, during the third year. 
The first practical schools of mechanical engineering were the Worcester Insti- 
tute and the Stevens Institute-of Technology, though it may be objected to them 
that they are schools for making master workmen rather than engineers. Ney- 
ertheless, as the practical work of the course of mechanical engineering is what 
distinguishes the institutions in which it obtains from a‘l other educational in- 
stitutions, it is well to begin with a consideration of it. 
At the Worcester Institute the regular course of instruction is prefaced by an 
“apprentice half year,” in which the four studies that the average student of 
mechanical engineering has been found to b2 deficient in are followed from Jan- 
uary toJune. These studies are English and French literature (6 hours a week), 
free-hand drawing (6 hours a week), and shop practice in woodwork and mould- 
ing (364 hours a week). Then during the three years of the course 10 hours a 
week are devoted to ‘‘ practice, which in the second term of the last year in- 
cludes machine design. 
In this shop practice two principles are observed: First, that while labor with 
hand tools and machines should be wisely blended, yet since machinery has a 
constantly increasing share in the conversion of material into useful forms, the 
educated mechanic should know how to design, construct, and assemble the parts 
of a machine as well as how to make its product; and, second, that excellence in 
construction is to be sought as a most valuable factor ininstruction. The power 
of the engineer, says the faculty, to decide upon general grounds the best form 
and material for a machine and to calculate its parts is greatly increased by 
blending with it the skill of the craftsman in manipulating the material, and the 
fact that the product is to be tested and used kindles interest in its manufac- 
ture and furnishes additional incentive to thoroughness and exactness. After 
the earliest lessons the practice is on commercial goods and follows the best 
methods of commercial production. Thus, while the institute offers a good edu- 
cation, based on mathematics, the living languages, physical sciences, and draw- 
ing, and sufficient familiarity with some branch of applied science to secure to 
its graduates a livelihood, its two peculiar features are: (1) that in addition 
to the general course of study and to the regular work of all students,in the labo- 
ratories each student devotes at least ten hours weekly to practice in the de- 
partment he has chosen; and (2) that the practice of the students in the de- 
partment of mechanical engineering is in well-equipped shops in which a 
manufacturing business is carried on. Construction accompanies instruction at 
every step.

EDUCATION. REPORT, 1889-90. 
  _ The printed page is not adapted to describing the technicalities of a machine 
shop and even photo illustrations are more useful as evidences of the equip- 
ment of the school than of the value of its work to the future engineer. It will, 
_then, suffice to say that in the third year of the Worcester Institute the students 
build one or more machines from their drawings, which, though made from 
definite specifications, are intended to afford ample field ‘for the personal re- 
sponsibility and originality of each student in making correct design and ar- 
rangement of parts of the machine in hand, While the work is not copying, it 
must not depart essentially from the best practice among manufacturing me- 
chanics. Thus one class has constructed a 25 horse-power Corliss engine, 
another a 10 horse-power upright reversible engine, another a 40 horse-power 
Buckeye engine.. The class of 1885 constructed an meine lathe 18 feet in 
length; the class of 1886 a Hendey shaper, etc. 
The Stevens Institute is, as its catalogue claims, a school of mechanical en- 
gineering.” There are departments of physicsand of chemistry, and applied elec- 
tricity is taught, but the object of the school is to provide a systematic course 
in the theory of machine construction and a study of existing systems. Math- 
ematics, pure and applied, mechanical drawing, shop practice and experimental 
_ mechanics, experimental physics, and chemical analysis, all are more or less 
powerful auxiliaries to the object of the systematic course in the theory of 
machine construction and the study of existing systems. But as we afe now 
particularly concerned with the shop work, it is necessary to keep to that. 
The work-shop course of the institute is intended to supply the student with 
a knowledge, as complete as possible, of the best existing methods and processes 
necessary to the construction of such mechanical designs as the theoretic part 
of the course will enable him to originate. But dependence is not entirely 
placed on the necessarily elementary and limited instruction that can be given 
in the machine, blacksmith, and carpenter shops, and the iron and brass foundry; 
but, after differences in machines, tools, and methods of manipulation are com- 
prehended by the student, he is taken to establishments where real work is 
being carried on. The usual tour of the senior class is as follows:

It will be observed that 40 of these hours are consumed in what is called ex- 
perimental mechanics, and so can not be called shop work in the sense of 
manual labor. For the fourth-year class there is a regular course in experi- ~ 
“mental mechanics given during a supplementary term of three weeks. Assist- 
ants chosen from the last graduating class take charge of a group of exercises 
and aid other students to secure without loss of time the data belonging to ex- - 
periments. As soon as the data of any one experiment are secured the students 
report to the chief instructor, who directs such calculations as are necessary to 
be deduced. This done the nextexercise is entered upon. The following chart 
will explain the character of this laboratory work ; 
Order of exercises in experimental mechanics, class of 1891. 
The figures 1 to 18 represent groups of students, consisting of generally two each, who aredue — 
at the inet opposite their group number horizontally and at the date opposite their number 
vertically. 
There sheet ‘be just twice as many groups.as there are exercises, so that every other day can 
be devoted to a test and to the computation of that test alternately. The instructors are al- 
‘ways graduates, either of the last senior class.or earlier ones. The exercises really consist of 
nine groups, each of which is so designed as to afford experimenting sufficient to occupy a full 
day of eight hours, and the computations occupy another interval of eight hours. .

Let us now consider a class of schools of quite a different character as far as 
manual training is concerned. Asa type we may take the Lehigh University 
course in mechanical engineering. The object of its course is the study of the 
science of machines. The principal subjects taughtare: The nature, equivalence, 
and analysis of mechanisms, the mechanics or theory of the principal classes and 
practice of machine design. To obtain.“ the practical engineering data which 
they will most need when beginning their work as mechanical engineers the stu- 
dents are required to pursuea course of shop instruction which does not necessa- 
rily involve manual labor and manipulation of tools, but is principally devoted to 
familiarizing them with those points in patternmaking, molding, forging, fitting, - 
and finishing, which they will need to know as designers of machinery.” In brief, 
the student is an observer, and is familiarized with processes as a foreman rather 
than experienced in carrying them through to a successful issue as a mechanic. 
To insure the attention and develop the reason, a full description of the process 
under observation and the means by which itis accomplished are required of each 
student during a series of properly graded examples of patterns, castings, forg- 
ings, and finished pieces which are not being constructed in the shops at the time, 
the blue prints for which have been given to them on entering the shops. The 
attention of the student is directed by these drawings, a printed programme, and 
a teacher who examines the pupil’s notes and sketches and questions him. The 
works of the Bethlehem Iron Company, the railroad shops at Easton and other 
engineering establishments in the vicinity are visited, each visit having a defi- 
nite object in view. 
As this approaches, perhaps, in a measure, duplicates, the characteristics of 
a German Technische Prue ile or Polytechnicum, an illustration of the pro- 
gramme of one of these schools isgiven. The periods represented are the first 
semester of the first and of the fourth yearsof the course. The charts are given 
to illustrate the way in which the German school carefully notes the difference 
between the lecture during which the student listens and the hour during which 
he is an active agent while working at drawing or descriptive geometry. Such 
work is called Uebungen [practical exercises] inGerman, and the word seems to 
have been understood in some of our schools to mean practical work. Thus, 
when it is asked, How many hours do you devote to theory, how many to 
practice? the correspondent is nonplussed to know whether we mean to include 
an exercise in descriptive geometry as practical work ornot. This opportunity 
may therefore be taken to say that drawing in any of its forms, even designing 
machinery which is to be made, or making out specifications of buildings or 
works to be constructed, is not considered by this Bureau as practical work. 
Some years ago when the polytechnic idea reached America it might have been > 
considered such, but the advance of the age in the way of organizing industrial 
instruction has rendered a truer definition of the term practical work: necessary, 
or at least rendered it necessary to reserve it for the work done in the shop, lab- 
oratorty, or field.

‘This municipal school has two divisions or schools, technology and civil engineering, each of 
which is composed of three specialties or sections, mechanics, spinning and weaving, and 
chemistry. During the first year there is no difference between the sections, and it is only. in 
the third year that the specialization is marked. The difference between the division of tech- 
nology and that of civil engineering is that which separates the three national schools at Aix, 
‘Angers, and Chalons from the central school of arts and trades namely: The course of tech- 
nology is a secondary technical course, while the civil engineering course is of university grade.! 
‘The plan of study of the mechanical section of both the technological and civil engineering 
divisions prepares especially for instruction in machine-making and in the construction of 
public works. The students of the section are particularly practiced in drawing, construction, 
Zz plan-making, levelling, and drawing up specifications (redaction des projects). 
Pd = The students of the section of spinning and weaving after the first year follow a special ele-

Now, let us turn to a third class of schools which is sharply defined from 
the two classes that have just been noticed. Like one class it lays stress on 
the shop feature; like the second class it lays stress on training the faculties of 
observation; but unlike both it does not teach a trade, but ‘‘ the underlying prin- 
ciples of all trades,” better, perhaps, expressed by ‘‘the underlying principles of 
construction in wood and metal.” So much attention was given to this class of 
schools in Chapter XV of the Bureau’s report for 1887-88 and in Chapter XVI 
of the report of 1888-89 that consideration of them is not now necessary, further 
than to repeat that the admirers of these schools may be divided into two groups, 
one group strongly maintaining the pedagogical value of the schools as secon- 
  dary institutions and the other urging their value as apprenticeship schools or as © 
preparation for apprenticeship. The three features of the shopwork in the ‘‘man- 
ual training schools” are well illustrated by the departments of the Chicago Man- 
ual Training School. :

‘If the drawing that is taught in the public elementary schools of almostevery 
important city and the clay-modeling, cardboard. construction, and even car- 
pentry that are taught in'many, be excluded from consideration, inasmuch as the 
public schools are not apprentice schools, it will be found that the types of schools 
supported at public or private expense to provide the country with mechanical 
engineers or mechanics has been exhausted. At New York there is a school for 
teaching the trades of bricklaying, and at Philadelphia a weaving school, but 
. the class of schools they represent has, as aclass, no existence in Americaunless _ 
the trade instruction given in the schools for the deaf, blind, and delinquent be

@ comprehensive description; for usually what is done in a single school is: 
made to represents all. the shades of meaning in which the term “industrial” 
school can be taken. For some years: Monsieur Marius Vachon has been in- 
trusted with an’ inquiry into the conditions of industrial art instruction (pecu- 
liarly near to French industrial prosperity) in Europe. In pursuance of this 
_ commission Monsieur Vachon has madeextended study through Europe and has 
published five reports.’ At the conclusion of his last volume hesummarizes the 
results of his study and trayel, and it is this summary that. has been translated 
and reproduced here as the best possible way of illustrating the character of 
schools which do notexist asaclass. in America, though we havea Cooper Union,

_ RésuMt oF AN InQquIRY IN REGARD TO THE SCHOOLS AND MusnuMS oF 
INDUSTRIAL ART IN EUROPE. : 
By Monsieur MARIUS. VACHON. 
The mission that the minister of public instruction and fine arts intrusted me~ 
with for the purpose of studying the organization of the schools and the museums 
of art and aay in Europe is at length completed. I have visited 110 schools, 
40 museums, and 14 great associations, and I may now present them in their 
_ proper physiognomy by typical institutions. Every form which instruction in- 
industrial art has taken has passed under my eyes and has rendered it possible 
for me to make a. comparison of the methods and systems which are in vogue. I, 
therefore, at the conclusion of my fifth report, summarize the results of this: ex- 
tended personal inquiry which: during five years has required a year of travel 
. and of study. : , 
Character of instruction. 
_At the base of instruction inart and industry are the apprenticeship school and 
the school preparatory to apprenticeship. The instruction of apprentices for 
the trades connected with art has taken. a great variety of forms, according as. 
the State, municipality, or association which supports a school has followed one 
of two systems, to wit: Apprenticeship in the shop or apprenticeship in the 
_ school. The respective values of these two systems have ovcasioned the discus- 
sions and disputes of pedagogues, manufacturers, and political economists. 
But before entering upon the work proper it is necessary that I should indi- 
-. cate as exactly as possible what I understand by apprenticeship in the school. 
There is a tendency to mistake the true character of the instruction the term 
indicates when properly used; and from this error unnecessary contradictions 
and empty polemics result. ; 
The manual instruction that has been introduced into the French elementary 
schools: has no relationship with trué apprenticeship, and it has been clearly de- 
fined in the Dictionnaire de Pédagogie et 1’Instruction Primaire of Monsieur 
- Buisson as ‘‘ School apprenticeship (apprentissage scolaire).” By this term is 
understood the “‘ workshop in the school,” a part of the organization of the ele- 
mentary school by which a few hours of manual work are added to the usual rcu- 
tine of school work. It is not an-apprenticeship, but a preparation for an ap- 
prenticeship; it gives the habit of and the taste for work.” Whenever, as in: rt

France it too frequently happens, the limit of this instruction is passed, pure ap-- 
prenticeship instruction is the result, and the extremely poor work done calls forth 
very justly the denunciations of manufacturers. In almostall the schools of for- : 
eign countries laboratories have been organized for the applicationof theoretical ~~ 
principles, and if they are not called apprenticeship shops the manual-training 
school of the public-school system should not be. 
» APPRENTICESHIP SCHOOLS. 
During my investigations I found true schools of apprenticeship both in 
Belgium and in Holland, and moreover they were so called. The most typical are 
the Iron School at Tournay, in Belgium and the Quellinus School at Amsterdam. 
The Iron School at Tournay possesses shops administered as a business con- _ 
cern, by a lessee. The student is thus simultaneously taught theory and 
practice while receiving a real professional education and learning a trade. 
Nevertheless, the very unique and remarkable organization of this school does 
not give good results. The number of students is small, 75 in all, and very few 
finish the term of apprenticeship. The working class is not interested in the 
school,and the municipality and the General Government are very much concerned 
about its decay. Undoubtedly this type will soon be abandoned. : 
The Quellinus School also has a peculiar organization. When the eminent | 
architect, Cuyppers, began the construction of the National Museum at Amster- 
dam, he was embarrassed by the difficulty of obtaining competent persons to ex- 
ecute hisdesigns for its decoration andfurnishing. Masters and workmen of abil: 
ity were utterly wanting. ‘ 
To train such, a school was necessary. The architect called together some 
friends, a society was formed, and with the concurrence of the city a school was 
established. The objectof the school is the theoretical and practical application 
of drawing to carving in wood and stone. The practical work is done in a shop 
attached to the school, which thus is divided into two very distinct parts. The 
shop is the enterprise of a society which, however, realizes nothing from the 
work, the proceeds being distributed pro rata among the students and professors 
who have executed and superintended each pieceofwork. Thestudentsare taught 
drawing, but the instruction is confined to making correct designs, and is espe- 
cially directed to the reading and reproduction of the designs of professional 
architects and designers. The management of the school, however, desires to _ 
give a more artistic character to the school and to make it a finishing institu-— 
tion so far as the industries taught in the school are concerned. Such as it is 
the organization is not sufficiently powerful to struggle successfully against the 
many obstacles which the journeymen carvers in stone and wood place in the ~ 
way of theschool'ssuccess. Moreover, the school isvery expensive. Each student 
costs annually $113, exclusiye of the interest on the building and apparatus. Iam . 
certain that a reorganization must be effected soon or the school will go under. 
In Russia, where a national industry has only lately come into existence, ap- 
prenticeship schools are very numerous. At the time of my visit there were 
more than fifty having more than 2,000 pupils. They are mostly the creations 
of the state or of cities aided by the state; but a number have been founded 
by societies or by private individuals. By the side of the great schools there 
are about 1,200 small schools which teach the industry that is peculiar to the 
village or city in which they are situated—carpentry, turning, forging, lock- 
smithing, tanning, bookbinding, ete. ; 
SCHOOLS PREPARATORY 'TO APPRENTICESHIP. 
On the other hand, the schools preparatory to apprenticeship are very numer- 
ous in Kurope. Of these the schools that I have studied as types are the Am- 
bats School of Amsterdam, the Technical School of Birmingham, Heriot’s Hos- 
pital School at Edinburgh, and Les Ecoles St. Lue in Belgium. 
Though deeming that real and industrial instruction is only capable of being 
given in a shop located in an industrial center, the founders of the Ambats School 
have recognized the necessity of a special institution where intelligent masters, 
free from the preoccupation-of business, shall introduce children into the prin- 
cipal trades through the theoretical and practical demonstration of their ele- 
ments and instruction in drawing. In the shops of Holland, as almost every- 
where, apprenticeship is an unscientific process, and moves so slowly that the 
apprentice loses heart. This is due to the selfishness and the negligence of su- 
perintendents and masters. 
   
-P-A-G-E-388
    980 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
The Ambats school is fed exclusively by the working class. In the general 
course the students receive a good elementary education. In drawing the in- 
struction is confined to the indispensable elements for the intelligent exercise 
of manual work. Those who desire to perfect themselves remain a long time at 
-the school, during which they receive supplementary instruction in drawin; 
and mathematics. Practical and manual instruction enters largely into the 
course. The shops are for carpentry, wood-carving, mechanical work, and lock- 
smithing. 
In this as in all'schools of the same kind the management is confronted with 
the difficulty of holding its students. As soon as the children can use the 
graver and the-plane a little they desert. The institution appears to prosper 
because it insists vigorously that the child shall be given a real manual educa- 
tion for apprenticeship. The society that founded the school has opened an 
annex in another part of the city. The cost per capita is $37 a year. = 
The Technical School of Birmingham and the Heriot Hospital School of Edin- 
burg have been organized in the same spirit’as the school at Amsterdam, to wit, 
to furnish industry with young people practically prepared for apprenticeship. 
But the English schools are of a higher grade than the Amsterdam school, for 
they will only receive students who have already finished their elementary edu- 
-cation—who have already acquired the elementary principles of art, of science, 
and of literature. To the shops for manual work have been added very com- 
plete laboratories of chemistry and of physics, where the students are intro- 
duced to real scientific problems and to a certain amount of practice in in- 
dustrial art. Before finishing their studies the students are engaged as future 
apprentices, as a rule, by the chiefs of industrial establishments. These schools 
are very prosperous and render great seryice to local industries. Day by day 
they grow and are constantly serving as models to new schools of the same 
nature that are being created in different parts of the three kingdoms. 
' The great institution known as the Schools of St. Luc, Belgium, follows the 
same course of preparing for apprenticeship to the trades which are directly 
concerned with art. On leaving the school the management places the young 
people in shops directed by former pupils, imposing on the superintendent the 
duty of sending the apprentice to school every evening and of admitting into the 
shops the professors who are charged with the duty of giving account of the 
conditions under which the apprenticeship is taking place and the professional 
progress of the apprentice. This system is rendered very practical and very 
valuable in results by the interest that the directors of the shops have in the St. 
Luc establishment, their own alma mater. 
Moved by the same ideas, the work of the professional schools of Belgium has, 
in every important industrial center, created syndicates of the superintendents 
of industrial establishments, who have organized shops in their manufacturing 
establishments, to which the students of the industrial and professional schools 
are admitted. These schools give theoretical and artistic instruction; theshops 
the practical exercises. 
Another type of schools preparatory to apprenticeship is that furnished by the 
numerous industrial schools of Ireland, of which the most remarkable is the 
school of Artane at Dublin. Only wholly orphan children are admitted, who 
are to devote themselves to domestic or rural work. They receive an elemen- 
_ tary instruction, elementary. ideas of science and art, anda rather complete man- 
‘ual education. Some thousands of children are raised in these institutions, 
which have the double character of a school and an asylum. 
ELEMENTARY SCIENCE AND ART SCHOOLS FOR APPRENTICES AND JOURNEY- 
MEN. (ECOLES COMPLEMENTAIRES DE L’APPRENTISSAGE.) 
Of a higher grade than the schools of which I have just spoken are the indus- 
trial and the technical schools.! These schools aim to give the apprentice and 
journeyman elementary notions of science and art after his work for the day 
ceases. Thus the economic value of the work produced by the laborer is en- 
hanced because it is done more rapidly and perfectly. The school completes by 
theory the practice of the shop. : 5 3 
These schools are the best type of institutions for the development of artistic. 
and technical instruction. They answer exactly to the new conditions of the 
_ organization of skilled labor and place in the possession of the mechanic an out- 
  
1 What we-would cail-industrial or technical the author calls ‘‘special professional school,” 
which are treated of further on. .

fit that is of marvelous power and yet of great simplicity. It does not interfere 
with apprenticeship in the shop, the basis of industrial life, and gives the ap-. . 
prentice, without causing social disturbance, without loss of time, and without 
great expense to the workingman a solid scientific and artistic instruction. 
The moral discipline of the school and the essentially professional character of its 
instruction does not disgust the student with his daily work, but rather tends to 
lend it new attractions and render it more elevated and productive. . Thus these? 
institutions are innumerable. 
Belgium has created 36 industrial schools, properly so called, which are des- 
tined exclusively to instruct journeymen and apprentices in the elements of the 
science or art which is demanded by their profession. The number of students 
in these schools is 10,597. If to these be added the students in other and higher 
professional schools the total number of persons annually instructed in Belgium 
in the industrial way is over 25,000, The population of Belgium being 5,853,278, 
the proportion of the population in professional schools is 4.2 per thousand. 
At Brussels, Ghent, and Charleroi the proportion is 1 in 100 of population. Re 
England is in the same category with Belgium. At London the People’s Pal- J 
ace has 7,000 students, the Polytechnic Institute 9,000, at Birmingham the Mid- 
land Institute has 10,000. In Holland the number of industrial schools is 32, 
that of professional schools 25, and the attendances 7,000, in other words, 2 per- 
sons in every thousand are in attendance. Switzerland has 87 schools with 8,000, 
pupils, not counting in the realschulen and others. Attendance on these schools 
is, in many cases, made obligatory. In Denmark there are 77 schools with 6,000 
_ students, the proportion to the population being 3in 1,000. In Sweden there are 
28 schools, that of Stockholm has 800 students, more than 5 in every 1,000 of the 
city’s population. In Italy there are 136 industrial or art schools with 16,274 
students. At Hamburg the industrial school contained 3,200 pupils, or 8 per 
cent of the city’s population. 
The types of this class of schools are numerous and vary with their enviroa- 
ment. In Germany itseems to me that the programmes give arta preponderating é 
place even in the centers of great metallurgic or textile industries, and that the a 
sciences are taught only in their elements. The same is true according to my 
observation in Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, and Austria. In England, onthe | 
contrary, the organization of the course tends in the direction of the pure and 
applied sciences rather than in that of art. The technical schools with well or- is 
ganized laboratories of chemistry, physics, and electricity, with shops for work — 
in iron and wood, are in greatest number. According to the most recent figures — ~ 
there were 112,808 pupils in technical classes, and 77,364 in art classes. i 
The Hamburg school is, in my opinion, the most perfect institution of its kind 
existing in Germany, as well from the point of view of the principles which caused 
its establishment, as from those of administration and instruction. Ithas served + 
as a model for the majority of the German schools. Upon entering the school 
every pupil, if he is not yet a mechanic as sometimes happens, must choose a 
trade. Many corporations of mechanics have inserted in their constitution that . 
the director of an establishment must send the apprentice to school for at least 
eight hours a week. Moreover,a law of the Hamburg Senate, passed in 1864, 
imposes the duty upon every director of an industrial establishment to send his 
apprentices to school during six hours a week. i 
The duration of the studies is not fixed by rule, the students must remain in 
the school for six months, but after that they may remain for two, three, four, or ~ 
five years even, according to their tastes and their aptitudes; in brief, they leave 
only when they think they know enough to work at their trade with advantage. 
The session is from 6 to10 p.m. The first half of the first year is given up ex- 
clusively to the study of the elementary principles of drawing. Copying is rig- 
orously forbidden ; all drawing must befrom nature. The second half of the first 
year is partly devoted to professional drawing. As soon as the student has ac- 
quired the ability to draw he is put to work upon drawing objects which belong 
to his profession. The following years the professional drawing proceeds pari 
passu with general artistic instruction. With the exception of the theoretical 
courses, collective class instruction is not permitted. Each student receives a 
personal, intimate, and varied instruction according to his temperament and his 
aptitudes. The master is constantly in the study rooms, and constantly inspects 
the work of the student, advising and criticising him freely. Punishment and 
rizes are unknown. The discipline is severe, but it is not by general orders. 
ach student is habituated to conduct himself. in a sérious manner and to con- 
sider the work as a social duty and not as an instrument of puerile ambition. 
The idea of giving the tuition without charge has been pushed aside with dis-

     EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
   dain as antidemocratic and as calculated to hurt the organization of the school. 
It is thought, very justly, that the tuition fee is an-excellent, even infallible, 
means of interesting the children and parents in the attendance on the course. 
The most typical and complete institution of this kind in Belgium, where in- 
dustrial instruction has had an immense development, is that at Charleroi. It 
_is not only an elementary industrial school, but a sort of higher institution for 
‘journeymen and apprentices. The course of instruction touches upon all the in- 
dustries of the region. In view of its double object the school of Charleroi has 
_ two kinds of courses, to wit, the evening course, which has asession every even- 
ing of the week from 7 to 9 during the whole year, and the Sunday course, from 
$:30 a. m. to 12:30 p.m. The evening course is elementary, the Sunday course 
in a certain way a higher course, since it is intended to supplement the instruc- 
tion received during the week in the evening schcol, or the local day schools of 
Charleroi. 
The eurriculum of the evening courss consists of French, commerce, physics, 
arithmetic, geometry, chemistry, linear drawing (figures and ornament), and 
to draw from plaster casts. The curriculum of the Sunday course comprises 
commerce and bookkeeping, arithmetic, geometry, physics, chemistry, tspog- 
raphy (land and mining surveying), steam engine, electricity, building and 
architecture, forging, coal mining and engineering, linear, figure and orna- 
mental, drawing from casts and modeling. Thestudent may choose the course 
which suits him, provided he has the ability to follow it with profit. A certificate, 
however, is only delivered to those students who have followed the course for 
two years at least, and have passed a thorough examination upon all the studies 
that they have pursued. _[ visited this school one Sunday when the ground was" 
covered with snow and witnessed a scene that touched me deeply. Eight hun- 
- dred pupils, young and cld, employers and employés, were assembled, and were 
_ listening to the discourse of the master, or were engaged in study, asstoically in- 
- different to the chilly temperature as they had been to the seductions of the 
salocn. Many of them had risen before daylight, had traveled for hours through 
the snow to attend the lesson of their professors—engineers or directors of mines, 
doctors of science, or other distinguished university people—to learn arithme- 
tic, geometry, physics, chemistry, and to pay for the instruction they receive. 
In England these complementary schools for the education of the apprentice 
form the type most in vogue. ‘There is not an industrial center, however small, 
- which does not pcssess one, and the great centers have many. I will add even 
that in reality these are the only industrial schools that really exist and that 
render real service to the national industries (J’ajouterai méme qu’en realité ce 
sont les seules écoles qui existent séricusement et qui rendent de réels services 
aux industries nationales). The day schools, with few exceptions, are luxuries 
(écoles de pur luxe), which are especially for young people who desire to enter 
upon a liberal career, for amateurs, and for persons whose time hangs heavy on 
their hands (cisifs). The attendance at the day schoolsis scareely a twentieth 
of that of the eyening schools. 4 
The great schools of the kind now under consideration that I have studied 
with care are the school of the People’s Palace at London, which contained in 
1889, 5,500 students; the school of the Polytechnic Institute at London, with 
7,000 students; the Technical School at Finsbury, with 1,000 students; the school 
of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, with 3,527 students; the Heriot-Watt 
College at Edinburgh, with 2,000 students: the Technical School of Manchester, 
with 500 students: the Technical School of Bradford, with 352 students. The 
instruction given in these schools is very thorough and of a higher order. 
To follow the course profitably it is thought that the student should be versed 
in the elements of art and science. But this requirement is not enforced 
and those who can not follow the regular course are taught in preparatory 
elasses. Industrial science figures largely in the programmes, and to complete 
the theoretical instruction laboratories and shops haye been fitted up with 
extraordinary completeness. In the case of great industrial centers having a 
predominating industry care has been taken to specialize the instruction. Thus 
I have found at the Birmingham and Midland Institute a real school of metal- 
lurgy, with laboratories, forges, etc.; at Bradford there is an evening technical 
school for the drapery industry ; at Manchester, a schcol for spinning and weav- 
ing: at Glasgow, a veritable school of marine engineering. 
Beside these schools where technical and industrial instruction prepondcrates 
or almost excludes any other, there exists a class of evening schools where the 
pupil learns drawing, painting, sculpture, modeling, etc. These are intended 
particularly for journeymen and apprentices in trades in which art plays a great 
.rdle. These schools are numerous and flourishing. Each city possesses one.

   CURRICULA OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 983 
The organization of these English technical and art schools presents the inter- 
ésting peculiarity that I noted at Charleroi, to wit, the use of the same building by 
the day and evening schools, the teaching corps being common to both. This 
is very economical. The social results are immense. The evening schools that” 
are attended exclusively by apprentices and journeymen come out in strong re- 
lief by their fusion with the day schools of high and low degree. The evening 
school is no more a philanthropie enterprise which brings the young and old 
together whose intellectual developement would otherwise cease, butit isan in- _ 
stitution of a high order in which the student must pay for what he receives. 
The journeymen, the apprentices, the son of the owner and the children of the 
bourgeoisie are brought together in public and both are honored by having been 
students in the same institution, and the social harmony increases. 
  SPECIAL PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Above the schools for journeymen and apprentices, are the special-profession 
schools which have the object of educating foremen and other higher employés. ' 
They are true higher schools of industry. The great schools of this class that 
I have studied are: i 
In Germany: The weaving school of Crefeld (founded in 1855, thoroughly re- 
organized in 1881); the metal-working school at Iserlohn (1879); the mining 
school of Bochum (founded in 1844 and afterwards reorganized); the school of 
iron and steel industries at Remsheid (1880), and the woolen-industry school at. 
Aix la Chapelle. é 
In Switzerland: The wéaving school at Zurich, and the school of embroidery 
and lace at St. Gallien. Tee 
In England: The Bradford technical college, the weaving and spinning school 
pe Manchester, and the technical school of the City and Guilds of London Insti- + 
ute. : : a 
In this typeof institutions general and artistic instruction holdsa great place, _ 
which is not the case, as we have seen, in the industrial and technical night 
schools. Those who attend these schools are neither journeymen nor appren- 
tices, but young people who desire to occupy a higher rank in the industrial hier- _ 
archy,2s foremen or superintendents. They study what I will call the indus- 
trial humanities. 
The most complete school and the best in its organization as to matters of in- 
struction and equipment is the Crefeld Weaving School. The school, in the 
first place, is something more than its name indicates. Its real mission is to 
train, by a professional, theoretic, and practical instruction and by a solid artistic 
education, weavers, foremen, silk dealers, and industrial designers for the textile 
industry. The programme includes the study of drawing and painting ; the ex-- 
amination and separation of all the tissues—silk, cotton, linen, ete.; the prac- 
tice and analysis of all the manipulations and transformations that they undergo 
before and after weaving; the theoretical and practical study of all the systems 
of mechanical and other trades; all the modes of fabrication ; all the motors em- 
ployed in the weaving industry; the appearance and the color of goods; indus- 
trial bookkeeping and commercial geography. The course, which covers two 
years, is conducted by fourteen teachers. Practical work alternates with theo- 
retical and artistic instruction. Theschoolcontains for these purposes,weaving 
shops with eighty mechanical or hand looms (metiers) with all the accessories, 
laboratories of chemistry, of dyeing, and printing, and a complete museum of an- 
cient and modern cloths. After spending two years in the school the studious 
and intelligent student has received acomplete professional instruction in weay-. 
ing, and is able to become an overseer in a shop, a designer, or a commercial 
agent of the first order. Inadditionan artistic education has given him the love 
of the beautiful, of the works of the masters, and a desire for new ideas (la eu- 
riosité d’.dées nouvelles). ‘ 
The schools of Iserlohn, Remscheid, and Aix la Chapelle, were founded on 
the same principles, and present an organization but slightly different. They 
are, as is the Crefeld school, true special schools for the officers of industry. 
The Technical School of Bradford and the Weaving School of Manchester have 
not the same general character of technical and artistic instruction. Their 
course is less complete and less elevated. I think that I may justly denominate 
them as preparing the under officers of industry. In England the dogma in 
matters of technical instruction, ‘theory in the school, practice in the shop,” 
is applied to directors as well as to the journeyman. I am not inclined to 
Boasts English in this, though I admire so much and recommend the Crefeld 
school. c 4

    EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
      SCHOOLS OF DECORATIVE ART. 
[SCHOOLS OF INDUSTRIAL ART, SCHOOLS OF DRAWING, SCHOOLS OF ART.) 
In the third class come the schools of drawing and art, schools of decorative 
_ art, or schools of industrial art. These constitute, so to speak, the higher in- 
struction of art applied to industry. They may be placed in three divisions 
which have no definite line of demarcation. 
England, Germany, Russia, Austria, Sweden, and Denmark unite in distin- 
guishing between high art and industrial art, between academic art and factory 
art, but Belgium is more advanced, and the old academies of Anvers and of 
Brussels are radically transforming their instruction. During the first year of 
the course the students receive instruction in drawing and geometry, the course 
being preparatory. In the following year the students find themselves called 
upon to choose the profession of an artist, sculptor or architect. To aid them a 
synoptic table has been gotten up which indicates the industrial branches ‘‘ which 
are derived from each of these general divisions.” It was thought that a spe- 
cialization should be made at the beginning of the second year as giving point 
to the study of art. Experience had shown that two-thirds of the students for- 
merly abandoned the academies before accomplishing anything because they 
were impressed with the inutility of the long course in art for their profession. 
The old system of generalization of the studies had the defect of sending off the 
, student in quest of pure art without application to industry, and thus made very 
bad painters, sculptors, and architects of them. 
Il. Organization and administration. 
SUPPORT. - 
In Germany‘the interlocution of the state in the support of these schools is 
manifested in many ways. When it is a cofounder it furnishes collections, tools, 
and furniture. When it issimply a participant it gives a fixed sum for a de- 
termined period. Finally the schools whose foundation it has. caused (provoqué), 
therefore called royal, are inscribed as beneficiaries on the state budget. The 
municipalities make an annual appropriation and sometimes provide the 
building. The workingmen’s and the professional schools generally receive no 
support from the state and are generally supported by the communities in which 
they are located, with the aid of societies and individual benefactors. 
In Belgium the municipality is at the head of theschool movement. Iteither 
takes the initiative or adopts a school founded by private societies as soon as 
their public utility has been shown. The state appears in the affairs of the 
school only as it makes appropriations, which, however, are always liberally 
accorded. The schools preserve their own autonomy, the state is only concerned 
with results, and if they are satisfactory the appropriation is continued. The 
municipality in giving recognition to schools founded by societies leaves to 
the society the management of the school, the appointment of the professors, 
/ the budgets, and the course. The municipality only administers directly the 
communal schools, buteven in them a great deal of independence is given to the 
directors. * 
In Holland, with four or five exceptions, every industrial, art, or professional 
é school has been founded by societies which direct them in a perfectly independ- 
Bi; ent manner. The state, province, or municipality grants them aid. 
be In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway the most active réle is played by private 
a) enterprise in the creation of institutions for the development of technical and 
“ art instruction. The state and municipality grants aid, but does not absorb 
their individuality. 
In Russia almost all the schools have been founded and are supported by so- 
cieties. The activity of the state is almost nil. 
In Austria-Hungary every school is under the minister of public instruction 
or of commerce, according as they are technical or art schools. 
In Switzerland the schools are generally founded and administered by the 
municipality. The Federal Government grants aid, which varies according to 
the more or less national or local character of the institution.

‘tn Italy all the schools are the creations of sOcieties of artists and of mechan- 
ics. So far from being supported, the schools have been opposed by the state and

In England the state has up to the present left the matter entirely to the 
municipalities, societies, and individuals, the National Normal School of the 
South Kensington Museum being the only exception. The municipalities make them liberal 
For the most part the 
schools are the creations of socielies who manage them and endeavor to make 
them self-supporting with the aid of contributions from private and public purses. 
Every municipal school should have a governing board at its head of five mem- — 
bers chosen from the inhabitants of the town. The state never interferes in 
the administration of the municipal or private schools, except so far as to re- 
quire from all schools that desire to share in the public appropriation, to recruit 
its teaching corps from among the professors holding the diploma of the South 
Kensington School. 
TUITION. This public appropriation to the schools of science and art 
of the Kingdom by means of an annual competition is large but variable. 
In England the system of gratuitous instruction is resolutely excluded as in-_ 
jurious. Scholarships are given after a very severe examination. 
it is the same, though scholarships are given to poor students.

In Belgium there is a mixed system and there are as many gratuitous as pay 
schools. Some schools require some pupils to pay while other pupils are edu- 
. cated free. At Charleroi the tuition is repaid at the end of three or four years 
to students who have obtained a diploma. In Germany

COURSE IN MINING ENGINEERING. 
The features which distinguish the course in mining engineering from that of 
‘ivil engineering become apparent on comparing the course of the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology given below with the civil-engineering course 
pein at page 952. Laboratory work is especially prominent. In brief, the min- 
.g engineer is a civil engineer who operates beneath the surface of the earth 
and a chemist whose specialty is metallurgy. The Massachusetts Institute of 
‘Technology has a special laboratory for the students of this course, called the 
Cummings Mining and Metallurgical Laboratories. The institute is careful to 
anticipate the common criticism that work in such a laboratory is no substitute 
for the experience gained inlarger works; for the object of its laboratory is to 
prepare students for such experience, to instil the spirit of investigation, and to 
emphasize the process given in the text-book. The mining laboratory consists 
of three parts—milling, furnace, and assay rooms. To bring the student into 
still more intimate connection with their specialty, summer schools of mining 
-and metallurgy are organized for the study of mines, mills, smelting works, and 
- geological fields. In 1890 the schooi, consisting of twelve students, spent a month 
at work—mining, setting timbers, and surveying underground—in the iron mines 
at Ishpeming, Mich. Next year instead of a mining a metallurgical school will 
be organized. es

As at the Massachusetts Institute the civil-engineering course is the starting ~ 
point for the other technological courses, and at the Rose Polytechnic the me- 
chanical engineering course is the basis of the other courses; so has the school 
of mines of Columbia College been developed into a general school of technology. 
_ Owing to lack of information, however, it is necessary to pass by this very im- 
- portant school and to let the Michigan Mining School represent the class now 
under consideration. It‘is hardly necessary to remark that the school is situ- 
ated in the northern or mineral-yielding portion of that State. The school has 
been in existence only a few years, having been established in 1886,

write dynamo, and the differenceis reduced toa minimum,

Recent arrangements at Purdue University have put that institution among 
the first in the country as a school of electrical engineering. A laboratory has_ 
been erected that is in itself an institution. The work has been developed from 
the mechanical engineering course and is identical with it during the freshman 
- andsophomore years. During the juniorand senior years the course is as follows: 
JUNIOR YEAR. 
Technical instruction. 
(a) Lectures and recitations,.electricity. and magnetism.—Thirty-eight weeks, twice aweek, This - 
work thoroughly covers the elementary theory of the subject, and forms the necessary ground- 
work for the more advanced and technical instructionof the succeeding year. The elements 
of electrical and magnetic potential receives particular attention. The instruction is by text- 
- book, supplemented by notes. 
(b) Laboratory work.—Thirty-eight weeks, 6 hours a week, consisting during the first term 
of instruction in the art of physical measurement, and during the remaifider of the year in the 
. elements of electrical testing. 
SENIOR YEAR. 
(a) Dynamo-electric machinery.—Thirty-five weeks, twice a week. This course consists of the 
fundamental theory of such machines, of their various forms, and the applications of the same 
to electric lighting and power. The mathematical theory of électricity-is drawn upon so far as found advantageons to the discussion of thesemachines. Systents of electrical distribution will 
beinvestigated, and tests:on the continuous‘and alternating circuits of the department discussed. 
Each student is expected to produce:from time to time’a paper giving the results of reading or 
investigation of some electrical subject. 
(0) Laboratory work.—Thirty-five weeks, 8 hours a. week. During the first term the sub: — 
jects: considered will be advanced electrical. testing and the standardization of testing appa- 
ratus, While the remainder of the year will be occupied with testing dynamos and motors, 
photometry and electric lighting, together with a practical study of the eee of electri¢e 
lighting and power, and, finally, practice in electrical designing. Inspections of electric light 
factories and plants and reports on the same are considered part of this work. 
(c) Thesis:—& thesis: giving an original design of some electrical machinery, or an original’. 
investigation and discussion of some electrical installation, is required at the end of the course. 
This electrical laboratory is a two-story structure of brick and stone, with a 
tower and ample rooms in the roof. The lower floor is given up almost entirely 
to electrical work. Thesecond story contains the physical lecture room, offices, 
drafting rooms, and the like. The institution had a comparatively small elec- 
trical equipment at. the start, but as soon as the new building was under way 
extensive importations: were made, so that there are now available a rather full 
set of the best modern testing instruments, and a well appointed dynamo room 
with all the paraphernalia of commercial measurement. 
The main part of the electrical building contains a general laboratory, lecture 99% = 
ol} 
room, two laboratories for special work in electrical testing, a small laboratory , ~ 
for magnetic and other extremely delicate measurements, a battery room, and a 
director's office. The dynamo room is in an accessible and well-lighted exten- 
sion, as far as possible from the laboratories where delicate instruments are in 
use. 
This dynamo room is 27 by 42 feet, and is supplied with half a dozen typical 
modern dynamos of small size, conveniently arranged for experimentation, 
Power is furnished by a 22 high-pressure straight-line engine. This is placed 
at the extreme end of the dynamo room, farthest from the maim building, and is — 
coupled directly to a line shaft running nearly the length of the room, and is 
supported at short intervals by substantial piers. This shaft is very carefully 
lined up, and carries the driving pulleys for the various machines. 
The equipment of dynamos consists of one of the original workshop type of 
gramme machines, brought to this country at the time of the Centennial Exhi- 
. bition at Philadelphia, a Thomson-Houston 3-light arc machine, a Brush 4- 
light are machine, an Edison: 40-light: incandescent machine, to which supple- 
mentary series: coils for compounding have been added, and a Slattery alterna- 
tor specially designed for experimental work and. giving an output. of about 
10,000 watts. In addition, a compound wound incandescent machine is under 
construction from designs by the director of the laboratory. This last isa 
Manchester type machine, with field magnets seated on a'gun-metai base. In~ 
connection with the alternating dynamo there are converters of Westinghouse, 
Slattery, Thomson-Houston, and national make. A bank of lamps and a Julien, 
. storage battery of 25 or 30 cells are also locatedin the dynamo room. A Sprague 
constant-potential motor and a Baxter constant-current motor serve as types of 
those classes of machines. The testing rooms are fitted with substantial ma- 
sonry piers independent of the flooring or foundations of the building, and are

quite free from vibration. The set of testing apparatus was designed to give 
opportunities for the absolute measurement Of resistances and of both alternat- 
ing and direct currents at all potentials. To this end the equipment includes a 
well-selected series of standard resistances, two of Sir William Thomson’s balance 
dynamometers anda Weber and a Siemens dynamometer, and two Thomson elec- 
' trostatic voltmeters, aside from the ordinary apparatus of testing and com- 
mercial measurement. The physical lecture room is located over the dynamo 
room, so that any kind or quantity of current and direct mechanical power are 
both easily available. aoe 
The city of Lafayette, in which the institution is located, has an electrical 
railroad and two electric light stations, which through the courtesy of the mana- 
gers are often available for additional instruction and illustration.

ARCHITECTURE. 
The readers of one of those romances of Violet le Duc which have an engineer- 
ing ‘‘ motif” will remember the answer given by the engineer to the architec- 
tural student who asked for the difference between an architect and an engineer. 
“You ask me a difficult question to answer,” was the response; ‘‘art has been 
separated from science and calculation because it is thought that both can not 
be held in the same brain.” However this may be, we have in America but few 
courses of architecture, those known to the Bureau being at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, the Lehigh and Cornell Universities, Columbia College, 
and the University of Illinois. The courses of the two universities last named 
are given, together with that of the technological university at Hanover.

» Until now the subject of engineering has occupied attention, but we have ar-_ 
rived ata subject which being neither engineering nor agriculture, but being’ 
- common to both will serve as an excellent transition from the one to the other. 
_ Before illustrating what a-course of professional chemistry is, let us make a dis- 
‘tinction for the sake of convenience, though the distinction perhaps is obvious — 
enough. The assayist is a chemist with a specialty, the dyer is also a chemist — 
with a specialty; but their methods, places of activity, and materials are very 
different. But beyond these specialties there is the chemist whose sphere is 
general consultation and analysis, the professional chemist. The practical or 
rather laboratory character of the course.in applied chemistry is well shown by © 
the chart representing the programme of the course for “‘ technical chemists” _ 
atthe Hanover University, whose excellent catalogue we now draw from for 
the last time. eh

AGRICULTURE. 
Two ideas, not mutually exclusive, though in a measure antagonistic, have 
dominated in the formation of the curricula of the colleges endowed with the 
_ national land grant of 1862—the education of the farmer’s son; the education of 
the boy for a farmer. The intent of Congress is sufficiently clearly expressed to 
leave no doubt as to what was meant by the caption of the act when it recites 
_ that it is ‘for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts.” But an act of 
Congress can not create a professional corps such as have the American classic col- 
leges, or even some schools of engineering, and schools of analytical chemistry 
had at the date of 1862. Liebig’s theories had not yielded to thosé of a new lumi- 
nary in biological chemistry just then appearing in France. Biology as now un- 
derstood was unborn, and the theoretical instruction of the German polytechnicum 
or the mathmatical instruction of the Ecole Polytechnique of Paris were the 
models for American schools whose object was to teach industry. Besides this 
there was the heaviest handicap of all—the meager mental training in literary 
matters possessed by those who were to attend these schools. Under such cir- 
cumstances the makers of their programmes were swayed to adopt methods and 
studies familiar to them, and in view of the limited education of those who ap- 
plied for admission to adapt their programme to the purpose of educating the 
country boy, and also to educate him as much as possible for the farm. To the 
complaint that in doing this the school educated the boy away from the farm, 
Prof. Clute, president of the Michigan Agricultural College, answers that 36 
per cent of the graduates are engaged in farming, to say nothing of the 11 per 
cent engaged in industrial pursuits or teaching in agricultural colleges, nor of 
the number who do not graduate. * 
The curriculum of the American agriculture school is therefore not a univer- 
sity course. of study, but by the necessities of its situation has been compelled to 
take refuge in that scheme of instruction which, in its extremest classical form, 
was worked out by John Sturm, in Germany, in the sixteenth century; by the 
- Jesuits, in France, during the seventeenth, and was modified by the ideas of 
Hecker, the founder of the German scientilic school (Realschule), and the ped- 
, agogics of the French revolution in the eighteenth. It might Be shown how 
this ideal of an education based on science found expression in the university of 
Thomas Jefferson as the education founded on the classics found an expression 
in the university of the Puritans and an education based on research found 
expression in that of Johns Hopkins. 
The course of agriculture auaraTS follows the composite character of the sci- 
ence. 
  Itis broken up into schools of chemistry, horticulture, entomology, for- 
vestry, veterinary science, etc.; Agriculture proper is usually considered aden

  the heads of agricultural soils, vegetable life, and animal life. As the require- 
ments for admission and the idealsof the schoo! vary so much, the time devoted 
to the agricultural topicsisnotuniform. The course of two institutions challenge 
attention. Both schcols have been founded by private endowment, are situated 
in New England, and are well calculated to illustrate agricultural instruction as 
it obtains in the United States, inits higher and in its secondary form. 
It is impossible as yet to say what the endowment of the Bussey Institution of 
Harvard University will te, further than that it is very large. It is a school of 
agriculture and horticulture, giving systematic instruction in agriculture, useful 
and ornamental gardening and stockraising, and is especially adapted for the 
instruction of young men who have been brought up as practical farmers or 
gardeners, as well as for those who wish to qualify themselves to be farmers or 
superintendents of farms, country seats, or public institutions or wish to pursue, 
some special branch of agriculture, horticulture, botany, or’entomology. The 
literary courses of the university are open to the student; and surrounding the 
school, and belonging to it, are 200 acres of excellent land. Theschoolis an agri- 
cultural school; its faculty consists of six professors and instructors called, re- 
spectively, professor of applied zoblogy, professor of agricultural chemistry, 
instructor in horticulture, instructor in botany. instructor in entomology, and 
the director of the Arnold Arboretum. Instruction is given by lectures and 
» recitations and by practical exercises in the laboratories, greenhouses, and ~ 
fields. The aim is to give the student a just idea of the principles upon which 
the arts of agriculture and horticulture depend, to teach him how to make 
intelligent: use of the scientific literature which relates to those arts, and to 
enable him to put a proper estimate upon those kinds of evidence which are ob- 
tained by experiments and by the observation of natural objects. The course is 
of one year, its professional character is indicated by the titles of the teachers. 
The Storrs Agriculture School at Mansfield, Conn., derives its name from the 
donors of the original property, the brothers Augustus and Charles Storrs, of 
Brooklyn, N.Y. It has been established for the education of boys whose parents. 
are citizens of Connecticut, in such branches of scientific knowledge as shall 
tend to increase their proficiency in the business of agriculture. Thus the 
object of the school is to teach practical and scientific agriculture and horticul- 
ture, ‘‘yet as subservient and necessary to this purpose various other branches 
are taught, especial prominence being given to those most necessary for the 
successful prosecution of agriculture.” 
In the class room the students study those branches of natural science, and 
only those, which have a directly useful bearing upon New England farming ; 
and the indoor work is made to harmonize with that upon the farm and garden. 
These branches are general and agricultural chemistry, natural philosophy, 
farm mechanics, elementary geometry, land surveying, botany, zodlogy (which 
includes especially domestic animals and insects injurious to the crops of the 
farm and garden), geology, human and animal physiology, agriculture, farm 
accounts, stock breeding, milk production, arithmetic and English, taking up: 
the general principles of scientific subjects and afterwards their special applica- 
tion to practical agriculture. 
During the fall and winter term, when the necessities of the farm (of 170 acres) 
demand it and the weather permits, the students are required to spend three 
hours daily upon the farm, and six or more upon study, laboratory work, and 
recitations, a part going upon the farm in the forenoon and the others in the 
afternoon; and during the spring term, five hours a day may be required upon 
the farm, when there is special need of that amount of work, and five or more 
in school work. Extra labor, as far as practicable, is furnished to all who desire 
it as an aid towards self-support, when it can be performed without interference 
with regular duties. The aid received from the State permits the school to re- 
duce its tuition fe2 to a minimum. 
In brief the general plan of the course is to begin with a brief history of agri- 
culture, ancient and modern; secondly, to enter into a study of soils, manures, 
and fertilizers, and the relation of these to plant-life and plant growth; and, 
lastly, a study of the higher forms of life, as represented in our domestic ani- 
mals. Stock breeding, breeds of live stock, and cattle feeding occupy a large 
part of the time of the senior year. The agricultural experiment station is 
operated in connection with the school. 
As an appendix to the remarks on the schools of agriculture in the United 
States, an account of the system of agricultural instruction in Prussia and in. 
France has been translated and inserted after the curricula which follow.

‘ THE SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS OF THE KINGDOM 0 
. ‘PRUSSIA. z 
Division A: UNIVERSITY GRADE. 
At the head of the system come the so-called institutes, which form a part of | 
the universities. As the chemical and other laboratory instruction are adjuncts 
to the lecture system of the university so these agricultural institutes are places 
for demonstration, exercises, and investigation, and of course with special refer-| 
ence to the business of agriculture. ‘The titles of these institutions are as fol- 
lows: 
1, The Agricultural Institute and Agricultural Chemical Laboratory in the 
University of Kinigsberg, with which isalso connected the milk chemical labora- 
tory, the agricultural physical laboratory,and the agricultural botanical garden * 
and the veterinary clinic. Founded 1869-76. Length of study, 4 to 6 semesters. 
Conditions of admission, the Reifezeugniss of a gymnasium.' Four professors of 
agriculture and 7 university professors. Appropriation, $4,293 for the institute

DIVISION B—AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES. 
As arule the agricultural schools (Landwirthschaft-Schulen) are not state 
institutions, although regulated by it, but are institutions subventioned by the 
State, a city, or a society. They have the object of preparing their students for’ 
farmers by teaching them as far as possible the science and art of agriculture, 
and by giving thema general education. The completion of the Tertia of a gym- 
nasium absolves the student from two years of the compulsory military service, 
and the completion of the course of these agricultural schools is accepted as equiv- 
alent to the completion of the Tertia of the gymnasium course. In Germany 
the standard of reference for mental training is ever the gymnasium course. 
In Prussia there are 16 of these colleges. They were estabiished as furnish- 
ing a grade of instruction higher than the Ackerbau schools (see Division C), 
and were regulated by a. Royal decree ef 1875, which furnished them with a 
code, and, of course, a programme. As might be expected, they have all been 
established between 1875 and 1880. Some were formerly Ackerbauschulen, but 
the majority are new institutions. 
The cities, provinces, or districts, and the agricultural societies have been 
about equally interested in starting though not in supporting these schools, 
but the Government exercises an oversight through the minister of agricul- 
ture, domains, and forests. In order to obtain absolution from two of the three 
years of army service the schools must strictly follow the curriculum provided, 
must have the necessary apparatus for teaching, and at least four professors, 
including the director, who must have passed through the course of an agricul- 
tural school of university grade. The subjects of the course provided by the 
Government are as follows: 
1. Religion. 
2. Language. 
(a) German. Correct use of the mother tongue and acquaintance with the 
classics of the language. 
(b) Latin (optional). Ability to read a selection from an easy prose writer, a 
piece of easy poetry, with assistance in the case of unusual words, but otherwise 
with ease and purity. é

3. Geography: Principal points of mathematical geography [astronomy]. 
Knowledge of the different parts of the world, seas, mountains, rivers, ete. For 
Europe, and especially Germany, special knowledge of the natural and political

facts relating to the Greeks and Romans. More special knowledge of the growth 
of the German Empire and the development of the states of which it is composed, 
especially Prussia, the intellectual advancement being regarded as well as the 
olitical.

A garden is always attached to these schools, and frequently more extensive

c Division C.—ELEMENTARY AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS. 
The elementary agricultural schools, or Ackerbauschulen, are lower agricul- 
tural schools in which the pupil of the country school may continue his studies 
while learning something of the theory and practice of agriculture. There are 
28 of these schools in Prussia, and although 7 of them were opened 1840 to 1860, 
_ the great majority have come into existence during the last twenty years, during 
which there seems to have been a desire on the part of the Government to pro- 
mote agricultural education. : > 
_- There is no common programme for thes2 schools, and it is thus very difficult 
to discuss their curriculum. Perhaps they may with sufficient accuracy be di- 
vided into three classes: Those having one or more teachers of the grammar- 
school studies, and a teacher of agriculture, those having a teacher of the grammar- 
school studies and teachers of agriculture, surveying, and the elements of vet-" 
erinary art, and those (the largest class) having several teachers of a course 
_ which resembles the scientific course of an American high school and also in- 
structors in agriculture and related arts. How far this instruction is carried it is 
impossible to say. As the completion of the course do s not absolve the student 
-from two-thirds of his army service, the State has no indirect way of stimulating 
_ a high or even a uniform curriculum, which thus being left to the locality is, it 
may be presumed, in some places high, in others low. The schools are excel- 
lently well supplied with experimental fields, ete. Smithing and other trades 
are taught. The course is, as a rule, 14 or 2 years in length; occasionally it is 
only 1 year, and in two instances itis 3 years, The summary of the statistics of 
this class is as follows:

_ COURSE IN AGRICULTURE IN THE HIGHER ELEMENTARY SCHC 
OF FRANCE. 
  Occasionally it has happened in the history of fie public-school systems of 
Europe that public economic distress or social disorder has been the cause of an_ 
_ addition to the curriculum of the public schools, and in order that, the new su 
_ ject may be properly and thoroughly presented in the elementary schools

-P-A-G-E-416
     EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
curriculum of the schools for training teachers has first been similarly enlarged. 
No sooner does the German Emperor complain, for instance, that he finds that 
the curriculum of the German public schools in the past has given him no aid in 
combatting the socialistic theories so prevalent in his Kingdom of Prussia, and 
straightway the subject of political economy is introduced into the Prussian 
schools for training teachers; and so hasit been with the subject of agriculture in 
France. Though the French revolution decided that agriculture should be placed 
upon the programmes, it was not until 1851, however, that instruction in agri- 
culture was introduced as a part of the programme of the last year of the course 
of the schools for training teachers. 
In 1860 the majority of 6,000 teachers to whom the French minister of public 
instruction had applied for suggestions as to the ameliorations to be made in 
elementary instruction responded that agriculture should be added to the course 
of the publicschools. Shortly afterwards the symptoms of an agricultural crisis 
began to appear, and an investigation was made into the matter for the purpose 
of remedying the evil. The commission were unanimous in calling attention to 
_ the powerful influence that elementary instruction would exert in favor of agricul- 
ture, the greatestnational industry of France, if introduced as a subject of study 
_ inthe public schools. The manner in which this instruction should be intro- 
- duced was given under three heads: First, the instruction that should be given 
in the schools for training elementary-school teachers; second, the instruction 
that should be given to the children in the district schools; third, the instruc- 
_ tion that should be given to the adults in special courses which were appropri- 
~ ate to the needs of agriculture. By the law of 1879 it was enacted that every 
department that had not yet established a departmental professor of agriculture 
should be obliged to provide for one within three years. At the close of 1888 
instruction in agriculture was completely organized in almost all the schools for 
training elementary-school teachers. But in the elementary schools instruc- 
‘tion in agriculture has been unsatisfactory. ‘It is to the teacher that a gcod 
book on agriculture is indispensable; in the hands of the child it is more hurt- 
ful than helpful,” says the report of the professor of agriculture of the Depart- 
- ment of the Gironde. 
But above the district school, and frequently in connection with it, there are 
higher elementary schools, which are of two kinds—professional and nonpro- 
_ fessional. In the city of Paris the course of these schools is as follows 
Theoretical branches.

so as to apply in the best way to the requirements of professional instruction.

ing of tools, a plane, jack plane, square, mark- 
ing gauge, grooving plane, work with the lathe, 
modei-making. 
(Fourth period)—Working in iron: Making 
a shifting gauge, working at the forge, elemen- tary work; making of tools, chisels, cross-cut 
chisels, boring bits, etc.; working at the lathe 
and with the cutting chisel. 
    In the schools of this class which have instruction in agriculture instead of in 
the mechanic arts, the course of agriculture covers two years, although the school 
has a course of three years, the first year of the course being entirely devoted to 
general culture. The applications of physics, chemistry, natural history, geome- 
try, etc., however, should be pointed out to the students to prepare them for the 
professional instruction of the last two yearsofthecourse. During the week there 
are two lessons in agriculture, each of oneand ahalf hours. The first year of the 
course proper is devoted to.the study of vegetable life, general and special agri- 
eulture, horticulture, and arboriculture. The second year is devoted to the study 
of animal life, rural economy, andaccounts. The syllabus which follows is modi- 
fied at the discretion of the teacher. The lessons upon general agriculture and 
zodtechnics should be made as general as possible, and only the plants and ani- 
mals which ave raised in the surrounding country should be treated in detail. 
No lesson on grape-culture should be given in a country where the grape is not 
cultivated, nor should a lesson upon tobacco-culture be given when none is grown 
in the neighborhood, and so on. 
fixed by demonstration, practical exercises in the school garden, and excursions. 
The teacher should avoid with care the use of technical words, which very fre- 
quently obscure his meaning and in any case load the memory of the pupil with 
terms which later on he will never use. The instruction should be as far as pos- 
sible clear, precise, interesting, and practical. 
Lately a course of agriculture for the country elementary schools of France 
has been printed; how far it is in operation is not known to this Bureau, but 
what it is is shown by the syllabus which follows:

Definition and object of agriculture. —As one of the branches of human knowl- 
edge. The object of the science is to find the most advantageous way of produc- 
ing vegetables and animals. Ts one of the most important industries. Résumé of 
its results. Capital that it employs. Number of persons that it employs. Its 
primary conditions, tools, and forces. The rdle of water, heat, and light. The: 
farmer should be familiar with the physical and natural sciences. Illustrations — 
f this fact by examples taken from botany, geology, z slogy, physics, etc. Ag- 
iculture as a science, as an art, asa trade. What meaning the words practice 
and routine should convey. The object of the course is not to teach the trade of 
agriculture, but to study the phenomena of the life of cultivated planis and do- » 
mestic animals and to give information that will aid in iis development and 
The course should be filled with practical and healthy ideas, so 
the pupil when he becomes a man will better understand his trade by rea- 
ng upon what he is doing and strive to improve his methods, to wit:

animals by improving the manner of preparing the food or ameliorating the — 
animal machine in a manner to enable it to employ the focd consumed to a bet- |

BIOLOGY. 
The study of biology has been given the attention its importance deserves in a 
special study issued by this Bureau as Circular of Information No. 9,1891. By 
an inadyertency, however, a notice of the biological departments of the Univer- 
sity of Illinois was omitted from the cir cular, and the occasion is here taken to 
insert an account of the biological work of that institution, which has been - 
kindly furnished by Prof. S. A. Forbes, of the State laboratory of natural his- 
tory of Illinois. 
The erection, in 1892, at a cost of $60,000, of a new building for the biological - 
departments of the University of Illinois affords a suitable occasion for a de- 
scription of their organization and work—in some respects typical for the State - 
universities, and in others unique. These departments are thrown together, by 
the plan of university organization, forming what is known as the school of 
natural science, which comprises the departments of botany, zodlogy, entomology, 
human physiology, and geology. 
The courses in this school are especially intended: 
(1) To afford a thorough and liberal education with a basis in science and the 
modern languages. 
(2) To prepare for the pursuit of specialties in zodlogy, entomology, botany, 
general biology. and geology, as a scientific career. 
(3) To lay a liberal foundation in biological work and study for a course of 
medicine. 
(4) To prepare for the teaching of the natural and physical sciences either in 
the higher schools or as a professional specialty. 
The sciences required for admission to the studies of the school are botany, 
physiology, and physics, with algebra through radicals, and plane and solid 
geometry. The scheme of requirements for graduation is so constructed as to 
permit the student either to specialize at the beginning of his sophomore year 
by the selection of a ma’or subject, to be pursued, if desired, for three years con- 
tinuously, or to distribute his principal effort within certain limits over a small . 
group of related subjects. To this end the studies of this school are divided into 
three groups: (1) required studies, (2) restricted electives, and (3) open electives. 
Under the head of restricted electives both major and minor courses are given, 
the former the maximum offering and the latter the minimum requirement in 
their respective subjects. : 
No student may graduate from the school of natural science until he has com- 
pleted all required courses, and has done at least nine terms’ work on one major 
subject, or twelve terms’ work on more than one from the group of restricted 
electives; and taken atleast minor courses in all the other subjects of this group 
in which such courses are offered. The major courses must be chosen for a year 
at a time, and may not bechanged without special permission. 
The required subjects are, on the other hand, general culture studies (mathe- 
matics, history, and philosophy) and, on the other, modern languages and draw- 
ing, required because necessary toany extensive pursuit of the biological sciences. 
The minor courses of the “restricted elective” group are all one term courses 
giicred in botany, zodlogy, physiology, geology, physics, and chemistry respect- 
ively. 
Major courses of three years are offered at present in botany and zodlogy only. 
In geology five terms’ work may be had, in entomology two terms, and in general © 
biology a single term, coming as a sequel to the courses in zodlogzy and botany. 
In botany six courses of instruction are offered—five primarily intended to 
meet the wants of students making botanical work more or less a specialty, and

_the sixth oceupying @ single term, complete in itself, for students whose “chief 
attention is given to other branches. Three to eight terms’ work constitute a 
‘Tajor course; that of the single term a minor course. To a very large extent 
natural objects are_ studied rather than books; but constant endeavor is made 
_to introduce students to pertinent existing literature. In the laboratory much

native and biological work on fungi; (4) the reproduction and development of 
plants; and (5) research work for two terms of the senior year for. such as are 
to presént a botanical thesis for graduation. i 
The zodlogy is taught in fivo courses: (1) a major course (restricted elective) 
of a full year, ten hours a week; (2) a term of embryology, likewise ten hours a 
week, for those who have taken course 1; (3) two terms of research work (senior) 
for those who have taken courses 1 and 2, and who select a zodlogical subject 
for the graduating thesis; (4) ayear’s work, open elective, in systematic zoblogy 
for advanced students only ; and (5) a general course of a single term, offered a3 
@ minor course in the schoo! of natural science and as an elective to the students 
of the university at large. 
» A course in practical and general embryology and in the theory of evolution 
- is given in the fall term as a sequel to.course 1. It is required of all students 
intending to present a zodlogical thesis, except such as take course 4. 
- A single course of two terms, ten hours a week, is offered in entomology. It 
is designed mainly as a preparation for economic work and investigation as a 
“. specialty ; but students whose principal interest is in structural or systematic 
- entomology are permitted to take aspecial line of such work in the second term. 
_ Paleontology is taught at present as a term’s work in geology, and requiresa 
major or a minor course in zodlogy as a precedent. f 
The department of human physiology is as yet in embryo, but ample provision 
for the development of the subject as an experimental science has been made in 
the new building. At present but asingle term is given to it. Comparative 
physiology is taught Sxtonively, however, as a part of zodlogy, with assigned 
experiments by students on the lower animals from the protozoa upwards. 
For those who have taken a major coursein oither botany \or zodlozy a single 
term (ten hours a week) of general biology is arranged and especially com- 
-mended. It is intended toreview, extend, systematize, and unify the’student’s 
knowledge of the phenomena, the history, and the laws of life, of the relations of 
plant and animal, of livingand notliving matter, and of biology toother sciences 
- and to philosophy. It is properly a senior study for students of the school of 
‘natural science. 
The studies of animal life are brought to a conclusion by asingle term’s work 
' (three hours a week) in anthropology, the objects of which are tosummarize the 
facts and theories relating to the origin of man, to introduce the comparative 
study of races with a view to ascertaining their relations to each other and to 
    
to the enlightened stage. 
The subject of physiological psychology in the department of philosophy is so 
_eorrelated with these biological courses as toamount to a practical continuation 
of their methods and spirit into the field of psychological investigation. 
Intimately associated with the zodlogical department of the university, and 
practically merged with it since 1884, is the work of the Illinois State laboratory 
sisting essentially of asystematic and thorough-going investigation of the zodlogy 
_ lication by the State, and the latter of entomological investigations whose main 
end is economic, but whose product is largely scientific and educational. Both 
ge departments of work, although supported by appropriations independent 
of 
partment of university instruction, and provided with quarters and facilities in 
. the new natural science hall. The State laboratory is also the headquarters of 
ducted under the auspices of the U. S. Fish Commissioner. 
The natural science building is 134 feet in length by 94 in width, and three 
stories in height above the basement. There is a spacious, well-lighted central 
hall, around which on all sides are situated laboratovies, lecture rooms, closets, 
_ storerooms, and dark rooms, a full series for each department. 3

   As an example of the arrangement and equipment of this building a general. 
-*description may be given of the provision for zodlogy. The students’ lavorat 
ries in this department are three in number, on the first floor, for clementar, 
advanced, and post-graduate work, respectively. In the first, table room is 
- given for 30 students; in the second, for 16; and in the last, for 10. Adjoining 
» the first is the private laboratory of the assistant in zodlogy and next this isthe 
lecture room. Directly over the assistant’s laboratory is that of the professor 
of zodlogy, and over the post-graduate laboratory is his private office. On this 
second floor are also the rooms of the Stata laboratory of natural history, con. 
sisting of an assistant’s laboratory, 36 feet by 21; acollection room of the same _ 
dimensions; a library, 32 feet by 23; and a room for the artist of the establis 
ment. In the basement of the building is a very large storercom for tho d 
partment, and an animal room to be fitted with aquaria, animal cages, and th: 
like. On the third floor are the zodlogical collection rooms, containing the ma- 
terial required to illustrate the work of the department. The zodlogical lab- 
‘oratories are furnished with microscopes and with an abundance of microscope 
apparatus, including several first-class microtomes, an imbedding apparatus, 
and an incubator. A full equipment for field work in the various departments 
is at the service of the students, and the library and collections of the State 
entomologist and the State laboratory of natural history are also made acces- 
sible to them under suitable restrictions. em 
The general museum of zodlogy and geology is in another building. It oc 
pies a hall 79 by 61 feet, with a gallery on three sides, and it is completely — 
furnished with wall, table, and alcove cases, full to overflowing with prepare: 
material. 4   
  
  
  
HIGHER INSTRUCTION IN THE SCIENCE AND ART OF TEACHIN 
t 
gH 
If the boast of autobiographies and the complaints of State superintenden 
go for aught it would seem that in many cases in the early days of the public 
school systems of the New England States the common schools were taught by’ 
college undergraduates, who thus “‘ worked their way through college.” Even 
now it has been stated that ‘‘of the more than 6,000 public school teachers in 
Tennessee at least two-thirds are working earnestly to. obtain a good education 
either by private study or by teaching school and attending college alternately.” — 
In this way it is possible to explain the fact that in Massachusetts fifteen years 
elapsed between the founding of her first normal school and the establishmen 
of public scholarships at Harvard and other colleges for the purpose of providing 
competent instructors for her one hundred public high schools in existence at 
the date of 1853.” s 
But by the act of that year Massachusetts did not establish a higher norm: 
training ; for forty-eight scholarships of $400 each were created and distribute 
among her-colleges, twelve of which were annually given to as many person se- 
lected from among the forty scholarship districts into which her territory had — been for this purpose divided,—‘‘ The scholarships were filled, the holders grad- 
uated, but they failed to become teachers,”! The colleges turned out what is 
usually called educated men but not teachers. In 1866 these scholarships were 
abolished. ate 
There is still another early attempt in this line to chronicle. In 1851 Brown 
University established a department of didactics in which a course of lectures was given ‘On the habits of mind necessary to eminent success in teaching, the 
relation of the teacher to the pupil, etc., and on the elementsof the art of teach- 
- ing or the best methods of imparting instruction in reading, grammar, geogra- 
phy, history, mathematics. language, and the various other branches taught in 
our higher seminaries.” The school, however, soon closed its doors. are 
This movement, however, was not confined to New England. At the instance 
of the State superintendent of Michigan the board of regents of the university 
of that State in 1860 permitted a course of lectures to be given on the principles 
and philosophy of education and the organization and mangement of schools. 
But it appears that the University of Iowa was the first to reward the student of 
: pedagogy with a distinctive degree.

_ cational authorities of Massachusetts urged the necessity of an additional and, 
higher course of instruction in the four normal schools of that State. At the 
date of 1870 those schools had a ‘‘ voluntary” course of two years, chiefly attended 
by former graduates, ‘‘who had learned from their experience in teaching the 
- yalue of a more advanced scholarship.” 
It was not until 1879 that a definite step was taken in the way of recognizing 
pedagogy as a science and also of recognizing the necessity of training teachers 
for schools above the elementary grade. In that year the University of Michi- 
gan established a chair which took the expressive name of the ‘‘ Science and 
art of teaching.” In considering the instruction given from this chair, the in- 
- quirer is struck with three facts, to wit, the announcement that the science of 
education, being one of the latest of the sciences, had not yet been cast into ar- 
 ticulate form, in fact was in process of formation; the scholastic character of the 
aitendance on the course, two-thirds of whom were college graduates; and most 
imvortant of all, the double requirements to be fulfilled before the ‘‘ teacher’s 
diploma” was given to the candidate, the requirements being (1) marked ability 
-ineither Greek, Latin, French, or physics as shown by special examinations, 
_- and (2)one of the courses offered by the professor of the science and art of 
teaching. The course of this chair was not long, only occupying, indeed, an 
academic year, and even this time was halved, one-half being devoted to the 
» study of supervision, grading, courses of study, examinations, the art of instruc- 
tion and governing (no practice or model school), school architecture, school 
law, in a word, superintendency, and therefore called practical; and the other 
_ half to the history and science of education and comparative pedagogy, if that 
term may be coined. 
The difference between this course and those of either the French Feole Nor- 
male, or the Prussian training colleges for Gymnasialpidagogik is marked. To 
_ illustrate this it may be profitable to compare the work at the University of Mich- 
igan with that of two typical Prussian training colleges for candidates for teach- 
ers’ positions in the classical schools called gymnasiums.

Having thus briefly reviewed the efforts to provide for the professional train-

the condition of the study of pedagogy in thos: institutions at the present day.

II. 
It would be difficult to generalize on the pedagogical courses of the more im- 
ortant universities of.this country, as they have few elements that are common. 
‘wo of these elements, however, are of considerable interest. One is that some 
universities have complete courses in pedagogy, whether graduate or under- 
graduate, while others make it an elective study for juniors and seniors in the 
regular college course. The other common element is that by establishing such 
a course or study these institutions recognize that the person who intends to~ 
teach should have instruction in matters and in methods that the candidate for 
the degree in arts or science does not receive. This may not be an attempt to 
recognize education or pedagogy as a science, as political economy or politics 
under the name of sociology has been recognized, but it is certainly placing ped- 
agogy on the same footing as those subjects. 
The only classification of the university courses in the science and art of edu- 
cation that is attempted here is the division into courses in which special peda- 
gogy (methods in Latin, mathematics, etc.) receives the emphasis and those in 
which the emphasis is placed upon the science of education. To illustrate the 
first the recently established course at Harvard is used; to illustrate the second 
the course at Clarke University is given. 
From its age, standing, and its conservative attitude in the matter of accord- 
ing to pedagogy a place among the sciences, Harvard University caused more 
than a passing interest when it announced that in its faculty of arts and sciences 
“courses for teachers on methods of instruction” had been established. These 
courses are of university grade; that is to say, they are only open to those who 
have graduated from a college of arts or of science. 
  ‘ University of Michigan in 1879, there is a department or course of pedagogy 
proper, which is called ‘‘The history, theory, and art of teaching,” and many 
courses, each concerned with the best methods of teaching the several studies 
of the collegecurriculum. The history, theory, and art of teaching course is di- 
vided into three departments, to wit: History of teaching and of educational 
theories, theory of teaching, and the art of teaching. The first and third are 
considered, either in the form of a lecture or discussion, twice a week during the 
year; the second, only once a week. In the first and second subjects two essays 
~ are required from the student, in the third the student is expected to observe 
the teaching in some designated school or schools in the vicinity of the univer- 
sity and, during the second half year, to present reports on what he has seen. 
In addition to this instruction given or directed by an assistant professor of the 
university, twelve lectures on ‘Topics in psychology of interest to teachers” 
aré delivered by the professor filling the chair of philosophy at the university. 
In special pedagogy there are thirteen subjects of study, Greek, Latin, Eng- 
lish, German, Frené As was the case atthe —

The courses at Harvard are ‘“‘adapted to the purposes of teachers and of per- * 
sons intending to become teachers,” not so with the curriculum of the depart- 
ment of education. of Clarke University. At the latter institution the work in 
pedagogy is ‘primarily shaped to meet the special needs of two classes, one 
composed of those desiring to qualify themselves for professorships of pedagogy 
in universities, colleges, or normal schools, the other class composed of those 
who intend to become superintendents of State or city systems of education or, 
wish to fit for other administrative positions.” In following cut this programme 
_ President Hall has constructed a curriculum that is quite an innovation. This 
curriculum falls, it would seem, under four heads—comparative pedagogy (if. 
~ that term may be used to connotate the description and comparison of foreign sys- - 
tems of education), the social effects of higher education, the effect of the arti- 
_ ficial or intellectual development of the child upon his natural or physical de- 
- yelopment, and special pedagogy, beginning with the three R’s. The courses 
- in neurology, experimental psychology, anthropology, and practical ethics (crim- 
-  inalogy, pauperism, and Gelectives) are open to the students. 
Certificates of proficiency are given on completion of the course at both uni- 
_ versities, whose course has been described, but at the University of Towa some- + 
thing more than a testimonial of proficiency is conierred. After two years of 
successful teaching graduates of the university who have taken afull course in 
pedazogy may obtain the degree of Bachelor of Didactics. The course in peda- 
gogy of this university—fully described in Circular of Information No. 8, 1891— 
is compesed of three sections, known as history of education (fall term), educa- 
tional science and systems (winter term), and school management and exempli- 
fication of methods of instruction (spring term). During the week preceding - 
annual commencement the State board of education holds an examination at the 
university for the State certificate. 
‘The teach®rs’ department of the University of Tennessee has been organized. 
to aid in educating teachers for the public and.private schools of the State, but 
especially to give this class of public-school teachers an opportunity to secure a 
better education. ‘‘ The course is in no sense anormal department. Our (Ten-~ 
~nessee) teachers have already, in the various normal schools, college, and insti- 
tutes, sufficient opportunty for that kind of training if they wantit. The pur- 
pose of the university is to advance knowledge, and the object of this course is 
to stimulate its students to seek a complete, liberal education, and it is hoped 
that many of them will take a full college and university course. A due pro- 
portion of professional training is provided as a part of their education, but in 
every thing the thorough development of the man in all bis powers will be the ~ 
_ object aimed at, and not merely his training to perform a few professional pro-

cesses. Even the work in the common-school branches has for its object the 
perfection of the teacher-student in these subjects.” 
A course practically of the same nature as that just spoken of is offered by the University of Wisconsin to graduates of the State normal schools who desire to improve their scholarship. ; 
At Cornell, Columbia, and Princeton, under various titles, there are courses 
or quasi courses in pedagogy which juniors or seniors of the regular college, 
course may elect. Of these the course at Cornell has the name of “The science — 
and art of teaching.” e 
Two schools of pedagogy which are connected with universities have pecu iarities that require mention. The comparatively elaborate system of pedagog! 
eal degrees conierred by the University of the City of New York is based upo 
the idea inaugurated at Iowa, that a degree should follow successful teaching 
and not precede the efforts of the holder in the schoolroom, and further that 
the course in the science and art of teaching is a professional course to be pursued.

school. The conditions under which the degrees are conferred are as follows:

(1) He must have been credited with attendance upon the required lectures. 
(2) He must have passed the examination upon each of the four courses first named. : 
(8) He must present a certificate showing three years’ successful experience in school-room 
work. © s 
The features of the department of pedagogy of the University of South Caro- 
lina that call for special mention are (1) the establishment of an undergraduate 
and graduate course and (2) the introduction of modeling and blackboard draw- 
ing as a part of the undergraduate course. : - Turning now to the schools of pedagogy which are unconnected with a unive 
sity, it seems advisable to take up the recently established State Normal College 
at Albany, N. Y., since the American prototype of this class of schools, the New 
York College for the Training of Teachers, has been fully discussed in chapter 
vu of Circular No. 8, 1891, of this Bureau, and in the Bureau’s annual r 
orts. j : S : 
z Of the several schools which constitute the normal-school system of New York ~ 
the school at Albany was the first to be established, owing its existence to 
the incompetency of the normal classes of the academies to fill their proper — 
functions. In Michigan, and in other States, the State university was called 
upon to give the higher education in the science and art of teaching required by 
the times, but in the States of which the Union was originally composed, with 
the exception of New York, higher education isnot under State influences, much — 
less under State control, and in creating a school of pedagogy even, New York 
selected one of her own schools for the purpose, and her first State Normal Schoo! 
This college has been established to give instruction in the science and art of 
teaching. Itis a purely professional institution, consequently nothing will be 
studied or taught in it which does not bear directly upon the business of teach- 
ing. Advanced courses in mathematics, the natural sciences, rhetoric, and sue’ studies-can not be pursued in the college, inasmuch as only methods of teaching » 
those subjects are taught, a knowledge of them being a prerequisite. Without 
dwelling on the particulars of the administration of the college which is just 
entering upon its,work, it suffices to say that there are three courses of study.

namely, the Hnglish, the classical, and the kindergarten. The minimum age for 
admission to the first and second courses is seventeen years, while for the kin- 
dergarten course the minimum age is fixed at eighteen. The only course which _ 
leads to a degree (B. Ped.) is the classical course, which isof twoyears. Itssub- 
jects are as follows: 7 COURSE OF STUDY. 
First term.—Philosophy of education, school economy, drawing. 
_ Methods of teaching the following subjects, viz: Number, place, language, reading, arith- 
metic, geography, grammar, penmanship, botany, physiology, zoology, composition, color, 
» object lessons. A course of réading connected with professional work. 
econd term.—Methods of teaching the following subjects: Algebra, physics, Latin, miner- 
alogy and geology, geometry, chemistry, rhetoric, astronomy, preparation of specimens and 
apparatus, discussion of educational themes. 
"hird term.—Methods of teaching the following subjects: Latin, Greek or French or German, 
history, physical geography, solid geomentry and mensuration, civil government, trigonom- 
etry, bookkeeping, English literature, sanitary science, school architecture, preparation of 
specimens and apparatus, discussion of educational themes. 
Fourth term.—History of education, school law, kindergarten methods. 
Methods of teaching the following subjects, viz: Music, drawing, physical culture, elocution, 
familiar science, teaching in model school, a course of reading c onnected with professional 
work, discussion of educational themes, school supervision. 
Among four hundred institutions carried on the lists of this Bureau as univer- 
sities or colleges one hundred and fourteen report students in teachers’ courses to 
the number of 3,414. In other words, nearly 8 per cent of the enrollment of the 
aur hundred institutions were studying in the teachers’ course or department of 
e hundred and fourteen colleges. Of these one hundred and fourteen colleges 
the great majority are situated in the Mississippi Valley; scarcely any of them 
are located in the New England or Middle States. With few exceptions these 
departments, or courses, are nothing more than normal schools, which are usually 
classed among institutions of secondary grade. In many of these departments 
Latin is introduced as a required or as an optional study; in most cases, how- 
ever, the course is concerned with the studies of the grammar grade’of the pub- 
' lic schools, with high-school mathematics and science., Bible instruction and 
surveying appear occasionally. In some cases it is very evident that the teach- 
ers’ course is constructed on the interchangeable parts plan. Thus if history of 
_ education, school management, etc., be omitted and less technical subjects be. 
introduced the prepara ory course of the college or university is formed. At 
the completion of. the course, which is intended, it would seem, to prepare for 
teaching in the district schools of the State, a certificate of proficiency is given. 
~~ The length of the course of the schools of the class now under consideration is 
generally of three or four years, frequently it is of two, sometimes of one. In 
_- the case of a one or two years’ course, however, the course may be looked upon 
as special or irregular. In conclusion it may be said that an intelligent gradu- 
ate of a thoroughly taught high school who had attentively read Compayré’s 
History of Pedagogical Ideas, a book on methods and management, and Sully’s 
Psychology, for example, might graduate immediately and with honor from the 
_ great majority of the normal departments or teachers’ courses of our colleges 
and universities. 
The Normal Department of the National College for the Deaf at Washington 
presents several unique features. To supply a limited demand for specially 
trained hearing-and-speaking teachers in schools for deaf-mutes, a few modestly 
_ endowed fellowships are available annually. The candidates for fellowships are 
graduates of approved colleges and universities specially certified by instructors 
in these institutions, and nominated by heads of schools for the deaf. The de- 
‘gree of Master of Arts is conferred upon fellows satisfactorily completing the 
course of study and practice. Harvard, Williams, Amherst, Yale, University 
of Mississippi, De Pauw, etc., have been represented in this department. The 
course of study includes lectures and assigned readings with required essays 
upon general or ‘‘ comparative” pedagogics ; class-room and ‘‘ seminary ” inves- 
tigation of the literature of deaf-mute instruction ; the dispassionate considera- ° 
tion of rival methods; the mastery of means of communication with deaf-mutes ; 
lectures upon anatomy and physiology of the vocal organs, and laryngoscopy 3 
the study of English phonetics, mechanism of elements of speech, Bell’s Visible 
_ Speech, and observation and practice classes in speech and “‘lip-reading,” with 
. detailed weekly reports of work done, occasional examinations, and a thesis. 
In the course of the year’each member of the class is expected to teach at least 
_ one deaf-mute pupil to speak. The same course of study has been pursued by 
candidates for certificates only.*

of the National College for the Deaf, kindly furnishes the foregoing sketch of the work of one

    CHAPTER XI. 
STATISTICS OF PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION, 1889-90. 
  The diagrams and maps on pages 838 et sey., the consolidated statistics given on — 
pages 3and 4, and the general discussion of the curricula of the several classes of - 
professional schools leave no occasion to discuss the statistics of the year. In- 
deed, to do so would be but to repeat what issaid far more concisely in the sum- 
maries which follow. These summaries have not been drawn with the intent 
of showing statistically the entire life of the various institutions during the year 
under review, but with the view of presenting a few primary facts, to wit, the 
number of schools, the number of instructors and students in them, of gradu- 
ates from them, and, as far as the replies of the Bureau's correspondents will 
allow, the proportion of the students having a degree in letters or science. If 
the secondary statistics, such as the financial particulars, are missed, they may 
readily be found by examining the report preceding, where they have been given _ 
with as much accuracy as the character of the institutions concerned (university 
departm nts, independent schools occupying rented buildings, ete.) will admit. © 
Matters of this subordinate kind do not vary sufficiently within a twelvemonth » 
to require annual insertion. Even in the case of the colleges endowed by the 
acts of Congress of 1862 and August 30, 1890, it is preferable to wait and use the 
more reliable figures which the act of the latter date exacts than those furnished 
to the Bureau under the provisions of the law of 1862. Table 6, therefore. may be 
-regarded as a compilation that falls short in its totals of the true amounts. 
In the case of the normal schools, the amount received from public funds 
shows a great increase over that reported for the preceding year. It is evi- 
dent that this is due in som2 measure to the separation of the qu:stion 
usually asked in the Bureau’s form of inquiry into two items, namely, appro- 
priation for support and appropriation for building. In former years it would 
appear that, as a rule, only the amount for support was reported. Assuming 
this hypothesis for amoment as true, an increase of only $28,000 is shown between 
the appropriation for the support of public normal schools for the years 1888-89 
and 1889-90. This amount is too small, as appropriations for building were un- 
doubtedly included in 1888-89 which have been rigorously excluded in 1889-90.

     CHAPTER XII 
METHODS EMPLOYED IN THE REFORMATION OF JUV: 
NILE OFFENDERS. i 
In all active measures for the reformation of the disreputable portion of society 
there is noticeable an element which, for want of a better term, may be call 
faith in human nature. Yet itis not mere faith in human nature that is to be 
so much noticed as the faith in the power of reason to sway and of habit to mould) _ 
ahuman being into the course of conduct. that society finds necessary for its 
preservation and approves. It is quitg, natural that in a Christian community 
this belief in the permanent possibility of redemption of the vicious should find 
its strongestsupport. It isnot improbable that the very origin of the belief was 
due to Christianity. The stages of the growth of the effort to prevent crime 
seem to be these: To prevent the orphan or the child abandoned by its parents 
from coming in contact with vice; then to reform those contaminated by such 
contact; and finally the reformation of grown criminals. 4 
At first the efforts made in this direction werea matter of charity, though con- 
ducted under church, or at least clerical auspices. But finally the State, solic- 
ited to lend pecuniary aid, has assumed or is assuming complete or partial charge 
of the work. In the early efforts of the church, enthusiasm: supplied the pli 
of method which was gradually developed as experience showed the way. State 
control was particularly favorable to this development of the art, so to speak, of 
reformation, as the expense of giving form to new ideas is more readily borne, 
generally speaking, by the public purse than by the purses of many charitably ~ 
disposed persons. : 
But with the growth of the conception of the interdependence of the physio~ 
logical and psychological phenomenain man as shown by the removal or mutila- 
tion of the sense organs of other animals, an attempt has been made to ascertain 
the laws which govern criminality: To scientists, therefore, the reformatory is — 
a laboratory of investigations; to the public, on the other hand, it is a place for 
obtaining certain results. In this chapter we are wholly concerned with the 
latter view. _ s : 
From a practical, that is to say, administrative, standpoint the key to the 
conundrum ‘‘ What shall be done with these children that they may be saved” 
seems to be in providing them with a good home, which is universally allowed 
to be the best possible place of discipline for them. To this end two method: 
have been employed, one old and requiring the services of an agent to visit the 
boys at the farmsteads where they have been received, the other, of compara- 
tively recent origin, which consists in furnishing a similitude of a home to a few 
boys selected from a moral point of view for their fitness to consort with one 
another. . es 
i. 
The first of several general questions asked on the form of inquiry annual: 
Briefly and in general terms please favor us with any oplnion or other information you mia; 
have to impart in answer to the following questions: x 
1. Assuming. merely for convenience in putting the inquiry, that it is highly desirable to sep- 
arate those more deeply tainted with vice and crime from the other inmates of the institution: 
(a) Do you consider that the cottage system answers this purpose, and does the segregatit 
of the more vicious amount to very much the same thing as a classification of all'the pupils by 
age? 5 \ (6) What changes at your school in respect to the classification of pupils and the adoption 
the ‘cottage system” during the last decade ?   
1 Prepared by Mr. Wellford Addis of the Bureau, specialist in professional education.

-P-A-G-E-472
  1064 EDUCATION REPORT, 1880-90. < 
_ To these questions the superintendents of the several institutions have replied 
as follows: 
Superintendent Hatch, of Colorado: (a) No data. (b) No changes. 
> Superintendent Howe, of Connecticut: (a) The cottage stystem admits of any 
_ @esirable classification. The natural classification is not by age. The natural 
family is composed of children of all ages. One or two boys or girls (‘‘ deeply 
tainted with vice and crime”) can safely be placed in a family of good boys or 
girls and thereby be cured by the contact. Nothing is so efficacious in converting 
the wayward as to make them feel that they are a part of goodsociety. (b) The 
: cottage system has been adopted and carried into effect in Connecticut within 
the last twelve years. 
Superintendent Haines, of Delaware: (a) I consider it very desirable to sep- 
arate those more deeply tainted with crime from the other inmates and think 
that the cottage system answers the purpose toacertaindegree. (b) Nochange. 
Superintendent Shallenberger, of the District of Columbia: Ours is the cot- 
tage or family system and consists of three separate divisions. The separation 
consists.in a division of the older from the younger boys. In each family there 
are two school grades. Out of school session the family is a unit for both work 
_+and play. Each family has two dormitories, one for the older and one for the 
younger boys. Classification other than this, in my judgment, is not important 
enough to justify the additional expense attending further or special separation. 
(b) Several years since another, the third, family was organized and placed in 
~ our new building. This made it possible tosecure asepartion of our older from 
. the younger boys—as indicated under (a)above. This has been adecided improve- 
ment, although our families are still toolarge. With another building we could 
make the association in each still more satisfactory. 
Superintendent J. D. Scouller, of Illinois: (4) We have both the cottage and 
the congregate system. There should be no mixing of good and bad, vicious 
_ and virtuous in an institution when you can draw the line from personal knowl- 
edge. The cottage system is perhaps the best for the separation of pupils by 
age and character. There should be a central cottage or building where all 
pupils newly committed (or a large per cent of them) should be on probation be- 
fore being classified according to the commitment, as information given by in- 
terested parties generally furnishes a reliable clue to the-true character of the 
‘boy committed. 
(6) We have added one family building or cottage. 
Superintendent Mary Lyons, of Illinois: There is no doubt that the cottage 
system has many advantages over any other, but for various reasons we have not 
been able to adopt it. 
Superintendent Sarah F. Keeley: I think that the cottage system is the better. 
However, we have not introduced this system, but classify our children by age, 
keeping the younger ones separate from the older. 
Superintendent T. J. Charlton, of Indiana: (a) I do consider the cottage sys- 
tem entirely adequate to secure the separation of the more “ deeply tainted” 
from those inmates who are less vicious. I do not consider the classification by 
~~ age as nearly so good as the method in use here of classifying them upon the 
basis of character. We have four families of large boys. ‘T'wo of these families 
are allcriminals; the other two, however, are boys of amuch higher moral grade, 
(b) None, except that we are more particular to classify boys as to character. 
Superintendent C. C. Cory, of Iowa: (a) We have two families; one in general 
dormitories in one building, one in single dormitories in another building, and 
much favor the latter. We have no girls that are what would be termed ex- 
tremely ‘‘ vicious,” and have as yet no necessity for segregation. Only for brief 
periods is anyone subject to unusual restraint. The more intractable are more 
benefited by associating with the good than the latter are injured by the con- 
tact, contamination being prevented simply by family oversight. 
_.(b) None. Next year we expect to erect another family building with single 
dormitories, making three families. 
Superintendent Buck, of Kansas: (a) If properly classified the cottage is pref- 
erable. 
(b) Pormed a family of smali boys. 
Mother Matron of St. Scholastica, Newport, Ky.: According to our ruleit is ab- 
solutely necessary to have these classes separate; butas we have as yet received 
none of the vicious class there has been no need of segregation. 
Superintendent Farrington, of Maine: (a) I think the cottage system partially 
answers the purpose mentioned above. I do not believe that the segregation of 
the more vicious amounts to very much the same thing as the classification of all 
the pupils by age. 
        
-P-A-G-E-473
    REFORMATION OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS. 1065 
() No change in the general system of classification. Our first cottageis 
nearly completed and will soon be ready for occupancy. 
Brother Dominic, Carroll Siation, Md.: (a) We have not tried the cottage” 
system yet and hence can not say much for or against it. But from my experi- 
ence it is of vital importance in the reformation of those children who are not 
so deeply tainted to separate them from those more vicious; and in this case the 
cottage system is preferable, and certainly preferable to classification by age. 
(b) None. We have always endeavored to keep the younger boysseparated as 
much as is practicable from the older. This we do in the dormitories, in the 
playgrounds, and to a great extent in the shops and class rooms. 
Superintendent Mrs. Brackett, of Massachusetts: (a) We have the cottage 
system, and believe that all inmates should be classified according to the past 
record of the inmate and not according to age. I do not think the segregation 
of the more vicious amounts to the same thing as classification by age. Some of 
our younger pupils are more vicious than some of the older ones. 
(b) No data. 
Superintendent Risk, of Massachusetts: I think the cottage system is the 
best as far as my experience goes, and it is upon this system that our school is 
conducted. 
Superintendent Eldridge, of Massachusetts : (#) Think favorably of the cottage 
system and more of separation on the basis of character than classification by 
nee. Think truant schools should not be maintained in alms houses. 
(b) None. : 
Superintendent Johnson, of Massachusetts: (a) The cottage system answers 
the purpose better than any other system. Thesegregation of the more vicious 
answers a much better classification than can be done by age. 
(b) No changes, as we have had but one family of 30 boys. 
Superintendent Chapin, of Massachusetts : (a) There should be, I think, more 
care in the separation of the two'classes named ; but in general classification 
Pst age and by school attainment serves the purpose with the cottage system to 
elp. 
) In 1885 the school was remodelled on the cottage plan. It startéd with an, 
administration building, where the superintendent and the most unmanageable 
boys were to be located, and three cottages to accommodate 30 boys each. Two 
years ago the large building was remodelled for two groups and at present the 
school consists of six cottages as nearly independent as it is possible to make 
them and have them supervised by one superintendent, The main mode of ar- 
riving at a classification is to grade them according to proficiency in knowledge. - 
Superintendent Margaret Scott, of Michigan : (a) I think it does. 
(0) This institution was organized under the cottage system and no change 
seems desirable. , 
Superintendent Gower, of Michigan: We have the cottage system. 
Superintendent Brown, of Minnesota: (a) I believe that division of the ¢chil- 
dren into families of 40 to 50 each, according to age, answers all purposes and 
with proper supervision the danger of contamination by the more vicious will 
be reduced to the minimum. 
(b) Have always been working on the cottage plan, but when we occupy our 
new buildings the classification will be more perfect, a3 the families will not be 
so large. 
Superintendent Shaffer, of Missouri: (a) Separation is good, say into three 
classes: (1) Those entirely good, (2) the large vicious, (3) the small vicious; the 
latter divisions being, of course, by age. 
(b) Separation into two classes, to wit, good and bad, on the congregate sys- 
tem. 
Superintendent Otterson, of New Jersey: Classification by age is not the proper 
way to classify. Classification should be made according to the moral condition 
of the inmates; that is to say, the separation of the more vicious from the less, 
irrespective of age. The cottage or family plan presents an opportunity to ac- © 
complish this as no other plan can. 
(6) Our institution was founded on the cottage system in 1865. Of late years — 
a more rigid separation has been tried. 
Superintendent Mrs. McFadden, of New Jersey: (a) I do think it answers 
the purpose in a great measure. I think the classification should be made with. 
regard to crimes committed rather than age, as many young in age are old in 
vice. 
(6) None; as our school only numbers about one family. i 
Superintendent Corrigan (Brooklyn Truant Home), of New York: For our in- 
stitution, no. The boys confined in this institution are not vicious, only mis- 
chievious, and I consider that the dormitory system is the best. 
   
-P-A-G-E-474
EDUCATION |. REORT, 1889-00. 
    a cciewlot Carpenter, of New York: (a) I eotsiee it highly een to 
separate those more deeply tainted with vice and crime from the other inmates 
of the institution. The segregation of the more vicious. amounts to very much ; 
the same thing as a classification of all the inmates by age. +o 
(b) The school has been classified as follows: (1) Senior department, oldest 
boys and two other subdivisions, according to age. (2) Primary department, 
joys from 7 to 10. (3) Girls’ department. Each “department is complete in it- 
self and is entirely separated from the other departments. be 
Superintendent Jones, of New York: (a) There appears fake no. appreciable 
ifference in the results of the two systems. 
{b) None. 
_ Superintendent Brother Leontine, New York Catholic Protectory : (4) Tadmit 
that the cottage system—that is, separating the really vicious from the others— 
eertainly has good moral results, but without strict supervision on the part of 
Ba prefect or master the cottage system is.a failure, 
(b) None. 
Superintendent Crawford, of Ohio: (a) The cottage system does fairly well. 
The segregation of the more vicious is much the same as classification by age. 
(b) None. 
Superintendent Hite, of Ohio: (a) Yes; the cottage system is the only system. 
_ that is in any sense reformatory, and its plans of separating the smaller inmates 
_ particularly from the larger ones is specially beneficial to both small and large 
pupils. We do not think the separation of the more vicious from the same ages” 
of the vicious is beneficial to the vicious; but, on the other hand, have expe- 
rienced that the contact of this vicious class with a better class, who are in 
_ the aseendency as to number, is helpful to the vicious and but very little harm- 
ful to the better class, if harmful at ail. 
(6) In 1878 all the smaller boys were classed by themselves and completely iso- 
ated from the larger boys. There has been*much improvement in the house- 
eeping at the cottages during the decade. 
Superintendent Laverty, of Pennsylvania: (a4) We regard the cottage system 
as manifestly to the advantage of the pupils by separating and classifying them - 
according to age and moral condition, with a more critical supervision and more 
intimate influence exerted by their care-takers. 
(b) None. A new institution is now being erected at Glen Mills, Delaware 
County, Pa., for the transfer of the departments of boys, to be reéstablished on 
the most approv! ed methods of the cottage or family system. 
- Superintendent F. H. Nibecker, of Rhode Island: (a) I consider the family 
stem, when fully carried out—each family having its own dining room, play 
grounds, and school, the pupils of the different families coming in “contact with 
one another only during hours of actual labor and when they are under constant 
* supervision and instruction—as of vital i importance to reform school work. Ina 
small school classification by age is the nearest to moral grading pessible. In 
aschool of sufficient size to allow more than one family of same age a closer and 
truer moral gradation may be had. 
-(b} During “the decade this school has been changed from @ refuge or close 
school to afamily school with congregate dining room and families, not classi- 
fied by age. Within the last four years the school has been elozely graded into 
_ four families. those of like age being in same family, etc., as noted above. 
Superintendent Ainsworth, of South Dakota: («) As a rule the cottage system = 
will do the work, provided the cottages are under the charge of suitable persons. 
Our boys; good and bad, are kept together; but there are always one or more 
“persons with them of good character. 
(0) When more buildings are needed cottages will be erected with a capacity - 
of from 30 to 35 children and the proper number of attendants, ete. 
Superintendent McCulloch, of Texas: I think that the cottage system answers 
_ the purpose. 
_ Superintendent Andrews, of Vermont: (a) I think the cottage system is better 
- than the congregate. 
(b) None. 
Superintendent Sarah K. Pierce, of Wisconsin: Yes. Have adopted the cot- F 
tagesystem, classified older pupils according to morals; younger pupils accord- = 
_ing to age and sex, the boys being under 10 yand composing one family. 
Superintendent Sleep, of ‘Wisconsin: (a) We have what is termed the cottage 
“system, but do not classify with respect to vico and crime to any extent, We 4 
class with some respect to age and size. Iam of the opinion thata classification ~*~ 
“ol eeepc to vice and crime properly done would work for canes :

Without discussing the case in which a reformaiory is a mere temporary place 
of detention until the boy can be properly located in a home, it is interesting — 
to inquire what efforts are made for his future welfare when the time has come 
for his being dismissed from an institution or otherwise discharged. Invariably 
places are secured for the boys by the school authorities. Sometimes these are 
' in the country, at others in the city. One institution of the East has an agency 
in Illinois to care for the boys. The usual mode of obtaining information as to— 
the manner in which the student is deporting himself is by periodical reports 
in writing, but in several States a more vigorous and reliable method is em- 
ployed. Thus the Lyman School for Boys at Westboro, Mass., reports that in 
- 1889 a special agent was appointed whose sole business is to visit the ‘‘proba- 
tioners,” to encourage them, right their wrongs, adjust their disputes with 
employers, find more suitable homes if they are not doing well, and in general 
make them feel a sense of continued responsibility to the State to dowell. The 
‘result of every visit is reported to the central bureau and to the superintendent 
of the school. At another reformatory institution, the State Primary School 
of Massachusetts, the boys are frequently visited by agents in the employ of the © 
State. For the eare-of the girls placed out in families from the Massachusetts. 
school for girls, ninety ladies are employed by the State board. In New Jersey 
areguiarly employed “‘ visiting agent” visits the boys three or four times a year, 
with power to recall to the school any who are relapsing. In the New York 
Juyenile Asylum there is a visiting agent for such pupils as are returned to — 
friends, and the school has ever exercised as close a supervision a3 means would | 
allow. The House of Refuge at Philadelphia has a competent officer visit the 
paroled pupils every six months. 3 
At the New York Catholic Protectory the visitation is annual, but the organ- 
ization of the church carries aid in this business of supervision. The pastor of 
- the parish in which the boy resides is corresponded with and_ presumably is in- 
terested in the welfare of the boy. - In Ohio, on the other hand, the State organ- 
ization becomes the organ of supervision, for the judges of the courts are re- 
quired to appoint supervisory committees in every county, who are to oversee 
the boys that are sent from the school. In Kansas the county superintendentof . 
public instruction is the visiting agent. ‘ : 
Tit. 
Two other questions of considerable importance remain. These are so con- 
nected that they may be discussed together. They relate to the time the pupil » 
may be detained in the school and the trade taught him while sodetained. The ~ 
following discussion is based on the replies to these questions : 
Assuming for convenience that certain disadvantages of the contract system tend to neu- 
tralize its undoubted advantages as a substitute for the manual work essential to teaching 
habits of industry and a trade, what effort, if any, have your trustees made during the decade - 
1880-90 to supplant the substitute by real’ technological instruction, and do you think such purely technical instruction feasible in view of its nonremuneratiye character? , 
Assuming further thatthe instruction of the delinquent at the institution is of no avail an- 
less he is under its instruction for a sufficienttime, what change, if any, in the way of lengthen- 
ing the time the pupil is consigned to your care has been inagurated by the courts or instituted | 
by law? 
Superintendent Hatch, of Colorado: No effort made by trustees. Theoretic 
ally, I believe purely technical instruction feasible. Have had no experience. 
Possible term of detention has been shortened from minority to three years. 
Bad change. : Sees lie 
Superintendent Howe, of Connecticut: In my opinion it is not practical to — 
give technological instruction to an entire institution. A few of the older boys _ 
may be so taught, but it is necessarily expensive. We have not introduced 
technological training, but hope to soon to a limited extent. We teach habits 
of industry, but ou industry is remunerative, which is always an incentive to 
labor. The law of definite sentences has been changed to indefinite or during _ 
minority. A boy can grade out of the institution by uniform good conduct in — 
twelve months; but he goes on probation and may be returned to the institution 
at any time his conduct may not be good. ; 
Superintendent Haines, of Delaware: We have no technological instruction 
in this institution as yet. I do think such instruction very valuable, and ought 
to be in every institution of this kind, without regard to its remunerative char- 
~ acter. : B

  <7 1068: EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. © 
Superintendent Shallenberger, of the District of Columbia: We have never con- 
tracted the labor of our boys, much preferring piecework at a fixed rate. This 
gives the school authorities entire control of both the work and the discipline. 
The trustees have repeatedly urged the propriety of establishing workshops un- 
der skilled foremen in order to teach useful trades and thus fit the boys to take 
their places when discharged as first-class-mechanics. Every reformatory in- 
stitution or industrial school should be provided with means to such an end, 
whether remunerative or not. Our boys are all committed during minority, un- 
_- less sooner discharged by the board of trustees; hence they could regulate the 
time required for any boy to remain at his trade. No boy should be forced to 
learn any special trade, and there would be no necessity for so forcing him, as a 
large number are always anxious to acquire some handicrafts and would un- 
- dergo any ordinary discipline to secure the means of becoming first-class me- 
chanics, é 
Superintendent Scouller, of Illinois: The contract system is supplanted here 
by State-aceount plan. Have made no effort until recently to introduce techno- 
logical instruction. It may not be feasible with State legislatures, in view of its 
nonrenumerative character, but we believe that it is a move in the right direc- 
tion, though it must be borne in mind that such training will never make a me- 
panic) it can only develop a taste for some industry. Sentences are fixed by 
aw. 
Superintendent Sarah F. Keely, of Indiana: Our manual labor is simply to 
teach the girls the common industries of life, thus fitting them for lives of use; 
fulness. We donot aim to make money, but work for the reformatory power 
there is in work. Under our old law girls were committed until 18, while under 
the new law of 1888 they are committed until 21. 
Superintendent Charlton, of Indiana: Our trustees ten years ago abandoned 
the idea of making money out of the labor of the boys. They are now working 
to instruct boys and not to make them a source of revenue. I most certainly re- 
gard technical instruction as feasible. We have detained boys on an average 
about twenty months. I think that two years would be better. 
Superintendent Cory, of lowa: As yet we have no productive industry. Only 
domestic economy ani common school work receivés attention in the instruc- 
tion of the girls. 
Superintendent Buck, of Kansas: We have never had the contract system. 
All are committed during minority. 
Superintendent Farrington, of Maine: I think such technical instruction is 
feasible, notwithstanding its nonremunerative character. We have established 
a mechanical school, where the elements of carpentry are taught. Boys are 
sentenced during minority, and trustees may discharge boys whenever they be- 
lieve them to be reformed. 
Brother Dominic, Carroll Station, Md.: Though we have eight or nine indus- 
ries or trades—printing, shoemaking, tailoring, floriculture—we find that our 
‘boys do notand can not remain long enough in the institution to teach them the 
trades thoroughly. Qne advantage, however, is that they learn habits of indus- 
try and how to work. I think, so far as remuneration in shops in reformatory 
institutions is concerned, it is a failure. Nothing of the kind ever undertaken 
by us has paid. The board, or rather the committee having the matter of super- 
vision of the shops, have established this rule within the last year, that any boy 
entering a shop for the purpose of learninga trade must remain there four years. 
This supposes him to enter at 13 and upwards. 
Superintendent Johnson, of Massachusetts: No effort has been made except to 
give instruction in carpentry. I think boys should be placed out to get-special 
instruction and should not remain in an institution more than twoyears. Truant 
_boys are now committed for two years instead of one year as formerly. 
Superintendent Chapin, of Massachusetts: Last year the Swedish system (Sloyd) 
ca was introduced, and during the last year all pupils have been instructed in it. 
Groying boys can not be used to carry on a profitable contract system without 
defeating the ends for which a reform school is established. Boys are sent here 
during their minority. Formerly the practice was to release boys after fifteen 
months’ stay on good behavior, 7.¢.,as long as good conduct continued. This 
- time has been found insufficient, and the shortest period will probably be here- 
after two years. 
Superintendent Margaret Scott, of Michigan : We have nocontract labor that 
interferes or retards in any way the plan of the institution, which is to teach 
every girl domestic work, including sewing, and the half-day’s training in day 
school. No change in the way of lengthening the time the pupil is consigned 
- to the school is required.

REFORMATION OF JUVENILE’ OFFENDERS. 1069 
Superintendent Brown, of Minnesota: Have always managed our manufactur- 
ing on the State-account plan and with special reference tothe benefit of the 
children. I believe purely technical instruction to be feasible. We have not 
been able to lengthen the time, because’ of limited accommodations, but believe 
the time of detention should be increased when accommodations will permit. 
Superintendent Shaffer, of Missouri: No change during the last ten years. 
‘Teaching habits of industry simply is not of so much importance as teaching 
them a trade by which they can earn their living after leaving institutions. 
Superintendent Otterson, of New Jersey: A printing office has been estab- 
lished, where 8 to 12 boys are taught all parts of the work. We issue a paper to 
enable them to have regular work. We also printed our last annual, report and 
do all our job printing. Boys are taught in all trades that can be made useful 
to the institution, though none are purely technological. To be of value there 
~should always be a purpose. All boys committed were committed during mi- 
nority, but by good conduct could earn their release in14 months. The trustees 
have just had an act passed which requires that all boys should remain not less 
than three years. This to the end that we may do more trade-teaching as well 
as school work. 
Superintendent Mrs. McFadden, of New Jersey: Shirt work was carried on 
to some extent, but we give our girls instruction in all branches of housework. 
They are also advantageously employed on the farm in weeding, harvesting, etc. 
The time of maximum detention has been changed from 18 years of age to 21. 
Director Round, of New York: We pay each boy 1 cent each day, providing 
he earns his 3 mills for education work, 3 mills for morals, 2 for deportment, 
1 for care of person, and 1 for care of clothing. His failure to earn 70 per cent 
of-his mills for any month puts him down one month. He is compelled to go 
through three grades of six months each before being released. The boy really 
controls the time that he remains at the institution after eighteen months. ‘ 
Superintendent Carpenter, of New York: Our older children make all the 
shoes and clothing of the inmates and do all house and farm work. Nothing is 
sold. Much like a boarding school, where the children work for their board 
and clothing and go to school. Thirty years’ experience has taught us that 
children should seldom be discharged in less than one year or be retained longer 
than about two years; hence children are retained here from one to two years. 
Superintendent Jones, of New York: They have established all the indus- 
tries on State account. The object of labor in the institution is regarded for its 
disciplinary power rather than for profit in money values. No change in length 
of commitment. Allcommitments are during minority, though at the discre- 
tion of the managers the pupil may be discharged before he has reached his 
majority. i 
Birothor Leontine, of New York: We have no contract system here. We 
manufacture the material for the employés, and are the sole masters of the labor 
of our inmates, which labor is more for the benefit accruing to them than for 
the gain to the institution. Rather than deprive a girl or boy of learning a 
trade or business that will be of use to him after leaving the institution, we 
make it a rule'to retain such inmates at our own cost. In-addition, we pay or 
put by for them a sum each month, so that on leaving they will have something 
to rely on for support. Within the last five years many have had as much as 
$50, $75, or $100 to their credit on leaving. 
Superintendent Hite, of Ohio: Since 1884 a polytechnic building has, been 
erected and has shown that it would be better to discontinue such industries as 
brush-making, knitting by machinery, cane-seating chairs, etc., and adopt man- 
ual training instead, even in view of its unproductiveness. There has been no 
law compelling an inmate to remain adefinite length of time. The rule adopted 
at this institution is that no inmate will be sent home under one year from the 
time he enters. All the courts commit during minority or until reformed. 
Superintendent Laverty, of Pennsylvania: Technological instruction has not 
been adopted to any extent. When we have reéstablished ourselves at the new 
location in Delaware County rudimentary instruction in standard trades will be 
introduced. We believe a more lengthened period of detention is important. 
The managers have been unable to adopt it, owing to the overcrowded condition 
of the boys’ departments. 
Superintendent Nibecker, of Rhode Island : In 1885 printing was.introduced 
and has been successfully prosecuted. Many competent printers have been 
turned out, who have always found good places. In May, 1890, $25,000 was ap- 
propriated for the introduction of other trades in the school. Technological in-- 
struction is feasible. It is improper to consider that children should be made 
- a source of revenue.

  Superintendent ©. W. Ainsworth, of South Dakots The Sonteace eee a 
itical move more than anything else. Our time is mostly spent on the farm 
and inthe garden, aside from the three and one-half hoursaday intheschoolroom. 
Wehave asmall printing office, in which are nine boys. Boys take care ofstock a 
ind assist in the household duties, ete. Nochild should be released: until the 
rudiments of a good education have been obtained and a knowledge of some 
kind-of industry that will enable him to obtain an honest livelihood. 
Superintendent McCulloch, of Texas: Only have the farm. 
Superintendent Andrews, of Vermont: Yes; I do consider purely technical 
instruction feasible. 
Superintendent Sleep, of Wisconsin: I think that we never have had the con- 
ract system. Ten years ago this winter the law changed the system of releas- 
g from 21 to 18 years of age, but after 6 years it was restored to 2lyears, Su- 
% pervisors have authority to remove at any time. y

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE.

_I1—THE COMMON ‘SCHOOLS. Z 
- The former slave States have a white saselation of 15,499, 323, aa a whi 
school enrollment of 3,422,785, or 22.1 per cent of the white population. 
The same States have a colored population of 6,954,840, and a colored scho 
enrollment of 1,289,944, or 18.5 per cent of the colored population. 
The colored form 30.98 per cent of the total opulation, but colored pu; 
form only 27.37 per cent of the total school enrollment. 
These figures show that the colored school enrollment is not relatively ¢ 
to the white. It exceeds the white, as compared with the population, in 
District of Columbia, North Carolina, and Texas; in the remaining States 
falls behind the white—in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and West Virg 
far behind. 
The ratio of average attendance to enrollment is 63.3 for white and 62. 
colored.in twelve States. ~

ALABAMA, 
Apportionment of funds between the races in Alabama.—The Alabama State dis- 
tributable school fund has heretofore been apportioned among the townships 
and districts according to the number of children of school age, the fund of each 
race being kept separate. This has caused much dissatisfaction. “It is a! eged 
that in portions of the State the colored race gets well-nigh all the school fund, — 
whilst that race pays a very small per cent of the taxes that make up that fund; 
also that the colored race is as yet, in general, only capable of receiving and 
profiting by an elementary education, which costs comparatively much less than — 
that suitable for the white race in its more advanced stagesof civilization.” The 
State superintendent, without discussing whether these complaints are well — 
grounded or not, says that there-are individual cases of peculiar hardship, and 
suggests the following plan: ‘‘ Let the school fund be apportioned by this office - 
to the different counties and townships in proportion to the number of children 
without regard to race, and let the township officers apportion the fund to the — 
schools of the township in proportion to the number of children who will prob- — 
ably attend cach school. They, being on the ground and acquainted with the 
wants of the different neighborhoois, ean do this to better advantage than it — 
can be done by this office. In addition to this, there should be fixed by statute 
a gradation of teachers’ licenses, so that well-qualified and successful teachers _ 
should receive greater compensation than the teacher who can barely siand an 
examination for a third-grade certificate. Inall other departments persons are 
paid in-proportion to the quality as well as the quantity of work done by them, 
and why should not this rule*apply in the payment of teachers? Under our ~ 
present appor rtionment of funds such is frequently the case—that the poor teacher 
_ of the colored race gets much better salary than the well-qualified white teacher. 
Tf this were left to the local school authorities such injustice and inequality would 
not be allowed.” 
This is practically what is done at present in the larger Southern cities with 
the local school funds (city appropriation); the municipal school boards apply — 
» the local funds to the various schools, white and colored, in their discretion. It 
is believed that the city colored schcois are amply provided for under this sys- ~ 
tem. Whether it would work as well throughout the country districts,adminis- 
tered often by trustees prejudiccd against negro education, and especially against | 
negro education at the white man’s expense, is problematical. That Superinten- 
dent Palmer does not think it would work injustice isevident, when he declares: 
‘Allow me here to say that I have no sympathy with those who would deprive — 
the colored race of an equal participation in the benefits of the public-school se 
            
-P-A-G-E-484
    1076 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. : 
fund. I believe that it is not only our solemn duty but best interest to see that 
the cclored race is educated and elevated so as to fit him for good citizenship, 
of which, in my opinion, there is not the slightest probability that he will be de- 
prived. Nor am I in sympathy with those who would apply only the tax raised 
from our race for the education of that race. Such a law or provision of a State 
constitution would be declared by the courts unconstitutional as being against 
public policy and as contravening the letter and spirit of the Fourteenth Amend- 
ment of the Constitution of the United States. The plan herein suggested will 
go far towards remedying the evils complained of, and that, too, upon sound prin- 
_ ciples—that teachers should be paid in proportion to the quality of the work 
performed by them.” ‘ 
Superintendent Palmer’s suggestion adopted—The law amended.—The legislature 
in 1891 changed the law so as to provide for three township trustees (instead of 
. one) who are to dispose of the school funds derived from the State virtually as 
Superintendent Palmer has suggested. Mr. J.N. Hutchinson, himself a town- 
_ ship trustee, explains their duties relating to the disposition of funds under the 
new law, as follows: They are required to ‘‘establish and apportion to each 
school just such an amount of the public funds as they deem just and equitable 
to carry on the schools in their township, not according to number of scholars 
pro rata as heretofore, but apportioning and giving unto schools as they deem 
best to promote free education in their township with due regard to all neigh- 
borhoods. For as the law was, where one school could get only ten pupils, in 
pro rating it was not sufficient to employ a suitable teacher to teach those chil- 
dren, and other schools had the advantage, especially the colored, which gen- 
erally outnumbered the whites, receiving the most money, and the colored peo- 
ple paying less taxes. Hence some neighborhoods were deprived to a great 
- extent of the benefit of schools, not being able to procure a suitable teacher on 
account of insufficiency of funds. 
“T take the position that one teacher's time is worth as much to them as an- 
other teacher, without regard to the number of scholars they teach in the pub- 
lic schools, and the trustees should seo that all children are offered the benefit 
- of schooling, and that this is the intention of the law, which was wise in our 
legislature in so changing it, and now it becomes the duty of the trustees to 
carry out the law without regard to the whims and complaint of some.” 
The new State superintendent, Hon. John G. Harris, further explains the 
situation as follows: 
“Tt isthe duty of the township trustees to establish a sufficient number of 
schools in their township to meet the necessities of school children according to 
justice and equity, having reference to the amount of money apportioned to such 
* township, paying to the teacher of each school an amount which will secure 
continuation of all the schools of both races, the same length of time. 
“This law confers upon the township trustees the power to contract with 
teachers at an agreed amount per month for three months or more. The entire 
amount belonging to each township must be divided among the white schools 
and colored schools by the trustees according to ‘justice and equity,’ not per 
capita. One teacher may be secured to teach a certain school at one price, while 
another teacher may be employed to teach a different school at a greater or less 
sum. Trustees must use their very best judgment, looking to the highest in- 
terest of all the children to be taught. Thegreatest good to the greatest number 
must govern. - Such, in my judgment, is the spirit of the law. ‘Equal rights to 
all, special favors to none.’” 
The words italicized, ‘‘same length of time,” are evidently designed to be the 
watchword under-the new order of things. ¢ 
The law only covers the State school fund proper. The apportionment of the 
State poll tax remains as before—poll tax collected from the whites goes to 
white schools exclusively, ditto colored. 
Colored education in Alabama.—W. B. Paterson, conductor of colored teachers 
institutes in Alabama, says in his report to the State superintendent: ‘‘The 
county superintendents and other white citizens attended the sessions of the in- 
stitute, and showed much interest in the education of the colored race. I find 
that where a colored teacher is competent and deyotes himself strictly to the 
work of teaching, that he can depend upon the support of the best people of the 
community. The county superintendents, too, discharge their duty regardless 
of race, and everywhere they expressed a desire to get the very best teachers pos- 
sible for the colored schools. 
   
-P-A-G-E-485
    _EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1077 
‘The colored people are being encouraged to build school-houses, and their 
white neighbors-are contributing liberally towards this object. 
“These facts are given to make more forcible the following statement: The 
schools are retarded in their progress by a want of unity and harmony among 
the colored people themselves. Desiring to get contrel of the schools, they are 
imposed upon by incompetent teachers, who establish a denominational or ahigh 
school, with an absurdly long and very illogical course of study, and the means 
of the people, which might be used very profitably to double the public-school 
term, are wasted. I have reference here only to the efforts made in small towns 
to build up a college on local patronage at a tuition of $1 per month. It would 
be good policy for the present to let Talladega College, Selma University, Payne 
Institute at Selma, and the State normals at Huntsville, Tuskegee, and Mont- 
gomery attend to the higher education and let the efforts of the people be di- 
rected to improving the public schools. Not one-tenth of the pupils entering~ — 
the above institutions from the public schools are prepared to take up a normal 
course of study.” : 
ARKANSAS, 
Apportionment of funds between the races in Arkansas.—A statement in the An- 
nual Report of this Office for 1888-89 was calculdted to create an erroneous im- 
pression as to the distribution of the State school mcneys. With reference to 
this subject State Superintendent Josiah H. Shinn writes to the Office: 
* The law apportions to all children irrespective of color. Each child in Ar- 
kansas, black and white, of school age receives the same amount of money by 
State apportionment. Each county in the State, irrespective of color, gets an 
amount of money equal to the sum of the amounts given to its children of school 
age; or the multiple of the equal pro rata per child into the number of children. 
of school age in the county. The county judge then apportions the fund received 
from the State in the same way to the districts. Each distriet gets from the 
State a sum of money in every case equal te the multiple formed by the pro rata 
into the number of children in the district. 
“So far the money has been apportioned as though no color line existed. 
‘“The money is now in the hands of the county treasurer, subject to the order 
of the [district] directors. Each district may have three funds, and must have 
two; (1) The State apportionment made by the State superintendent; (2) the 
poll-tax apportionment made by the county judge; (3) the local tax voted upon 
the property of the district and paid by the collector to the treasurer of the 
county for the use of that district alone. 
“T desire to emphasize this point again. Up to this point in our financial 
management—the point when the directors are to open the schools—no distinc- 
tion whatever has been made. It has been a question of cold calculation without 
one drop of blood. If any discrimination is made now, the fault will lie with the 
directors. The law requires them to hold separate schoolsfor the races. There 
is no restriction upon the black man’s right to hold the office of school director. 
In eastern Arkansas in a large majority of the districts the directory is black. 
Two plans have been adopted by directors, irrespective of color. 
‘1. To hold a three months’ school for each color, and as much longer as their 
proportionate share of the district funds will continue it. This share is deter- 
mined by taking the ratio of the black and white children of school age, respect- 
ively, to the whole number of children. 
2. To hold two schools of equal length, irrespective of these proportions. 
“(a) As to the first proposition, the division is always more favorable to the 
colored race than to the white. Where but eight or ten children of either color 
were to be found in any district a trouble followed in nearly every case. Bucy 
directors saw little use in running a school for less than ten white children; s 
did the white ones. The legislature cured this last winter by permitting any 
number less than ten to transfer to the adjoining district. 
‘(b) The second proposition is on the broadest basis of fairness, and reaches 
the widest stretch of justice. No more can be claimed. it would be unjust to 
my fellow-citizens not to say further that the great majority of our school di- 
rectors follow the second plan. 
“In the following cities and towns the terms and all the other arrangements 
are equal: Little Rock, Helena, Marianna, Pine Bluff, Monticello, Lonoke, 
Camden, Texarkana, Hope, Nashville, Washington, Prescott, Malvern, Conway, 
Moulton, Newport, Augusta, Russellville, Fort Smith, Van Buren, and Hot 
Springs.”

1078 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  DELAWARE. 
The colored schools of Delaware.—‘‘There are only 46 [colored] schoolhouses in 
the State and 79 schools. Thirty-three of the schools are held either in private 
houses or churches, mostly the latter. All the schoolhouses occupied have keen 
puilt by the colored people themselves, and some of the buildings are in the last 
stages of dilapidation. Some of the echools find it necessary to charge a tuition 
fee and others raise funds by subscription in order to secure sufficient money 
to pay the teacher’s salary.” 
The State superintendent suggests ‘‘ that it would be wise to increase the State 
appropriation to these schools in order that they may be made free schools in 
fact. If education is a safeguard it would seem to need no argument that the 
colored schools should be made as efficient as possible.” 
- The sum of $6,000 was appropriated for these schools in 1889-’90, or a little 
over $1 for each colored child of school age in the State. 
FLORIDA. 
~ Capacity of colored students—Appreciation of school advantages.—The principal of 
the Florida State Normal College for Colored Persons reports: ‘‘ The students 
are specially drilled in the abstract sciences in which they are the weakest, while 
their strong linguistic powers are given the fullest exercise. The imperfect at- 
_ tainments in the common studies which they bring to the institution are dis- 
placed by a severe training in the same studies, when they are carried through 
algebra to quadratics and through several books,of geometry. In all these 
studies they can compete favorably with scholars of similar grade anywhere. 
In the Latin, the only classic thus far taught, they are carried through several 
_ books of Cxsar’s Commentaries, just enough to give them a proper foundation 
_ to continue the study of the thoughts of the iron-hearted masters of the ancient 
world after graduation. Although it isless than two years since the senior class 
- began the study of Latin, several of them can. now read Cesar with an ease and 
elegance that would do credit to scholars who have been engaged twice the length 
_of time in studying this language. 
_ “The surest test for the appreciation of the race for the school is in the sacri- 
 fices made by patrons in sending and maintaining scholars here, and the eager- 
__ ness of the latter to avail themselves of the oppor.unity offered them for instruc- 
tion. With limited means or from daily earnings parents send their children 
to this school from distant parts of the State and meet.all the financial engage- 
ments incident to the education of a young person during the entire session of 
nine months. Although this is the second year since the school has had dormi- 
tory halls, not only has every patron met all his obligations, but the demand for 
more room in the dormitories is restricted by our inability to provide for any 
more new-comers. 
‘The promptness and regularity of attendance at the daily sessions of the 
- school is another proof of high appreciation. Noseverer punishment for breach 
of discipline can be inflicted on any of them than to be ordered to leave school 
for even part of a day. Theyseem to feel that every day and hour are too pre- 
ciors to be lost from the presecution of the purpose for which they have come 
_ hither from their homes. This strong regard and attachment for a school but 
lately established is one of the mést pleasing features which promise for it, let 
_ it be hoped, a long career of usefulness.” 
ao GEORGIA. 
State School Commissioner James S. Hook: ‘‘It is due the colored people to 
~ say that everywhere in Georgia, as far as they have come within my observa- 
tion, they are anxious for improvement, and in proportion as they become in- 
terested in the schools I note growth in moral sentiment, less interest in parti- 
san politics, and more anxiety tomake themselves useful and respected citizens.” 
The University of Atlanta, as is well known, has, under the provision of the 
State constitution forbidding the coeducation of whites and colored, forfeited 
its State grant. Some of the prominent colored educators of the State are set- 
ting on foot a movement to obtain this suspended grant inorder to establish @ 
- normal school for training colored teachers.

   What the county superintendents say. 
Crawford County.—Colored schools were well attended, but a decrease in num- 
ber of schools, on account of not being able to get teachers that could make the _ 
required percentage in examination. : 
Houston County—The colored people manifest a great desire to have their _ 
children educated; their schools were kept full and the average attendance was 
good. The colored children of our county outnumber the whites almost 4 to 1, 
and all their schools are full to overflowing whenever opened. In some parts of — 
the county the white people are so sparsely settled thatit is impossible for them 
to have schools. cee 
Jasper County.—There is not a child of school age in the county, white or 
black, but what has a schoolhouse conyeniently located and can attend school 
most any kind of weather. 3 
Mitchell County.—The colored-people of our county are very manifest in their 
interest of education. Many of our colored schools, if allowed, are crowded be- 
yond accommodations. . 
Oconce County.—By no means tax the whites to educate the blacks. This has 
made a ‘‘skeleton” of what otherwise would have been acorpulent and muscular — 
man—a giant [referring to the school system]. 
Putnam County.—We should have more money, negroorno negro. Something 
isnecessarily obliged to be done or the whites will not keep up with the darkey. 
  MARYLAND. 
The colored schools of Maryland.—Dr. James L. Bryan, school examiner of Dor- 
chester County, Md., reports as follows: ‘‘There is great pleasure and just pride’ 
’ in stating that our colored schools are a credit to our system. When I began 
my work in this county in 1867 there were no colored schools connected with the 
public-school system. ‘There were two or three run by friends outside of the 
State. The school board of that day made a small appropriation to two of those 
schools, and gradually increased the amount until the new school law of 1872” 
placed such schools directly under the control of the school board. Since that 
day: these schools have increased from two or three to forty, and the teachers 
compare favorably with the white teachers, considering the poor advantages — 
they have had to make themselves expert teachers. With two or three excep-_ 
tions these schools occupy houses belonging to the school authorities, built gcn- _ 
erally for school purposes, and with comfortable furniture, blackboards, ete. 
One house, in Cambridge, used by colored pupils, cost nearly $2,500; another, in 
East Newmarket, cost over $1,000. 
“There is small but a steady increase in the numbers attending the schools, _- 
and the results are quite gratifying. } ae. 
“Tt is a great credit to the powers that be that this work has been done so 
well. It is honorable to the authorities, and should dispel all doubts of fairness 
in the matter of educating this class of our people.” x 
And the examiner of Harford County says: ‘‘Th a number of cases we lack 
suitable houses and furniture for the colored schools; but our greatest drawback — 
in this line is an efficient corps of teachers. I do not hesitate to say thatI have 
more difficulty in securing twenty-two. suitable colored teachers than one hun- — 
dred and fourteen white ones.’ I anxiously look forward to the day when we 
may rely upon the colored normal school of this State for our colored teachers, ~~ 
“Tn many cases, too, it is difficult to secure prompt and regular attendance of |— 
colored children. Having satisfied their ambition by enrolling their names at 
school, the very ones most in need of its benefits are the ones most apt to be ab- 
sent. Recognizing the large factor they have become in some sections, I see no — 
higher duty the State has to perform than to do what she can to educate this 
large class of her citizens.” 
  NORTH CAROLINA. 
Causes of opposition to negro education.—State Superintendent S. M. Finger, of 
North Carolina,says: ‘there is much opposition to public schools in the State, 
and in the South generally, because of the small amount of the taxes paid by the © 
negroes. The opposition is intensified by the belief, that is more or less preva- . 
lent, that education spoils the colored people as laborers, to their own damage 
and the damage of the white people. It is said that when you ‘educate anegro 
you spoil a field hand,’
-P-A-G-E-488
  x : “ co 
} ~ 1080 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
“On this point it may be said with truth that the negro’s sudden freedom and 
citizenship, for which he was unprepared, the privileges of education, and all 
the new experiences he had at and soon after the war, including much bad lead- 
ership, completely turned his head, so to speak. Forced labor to him had, dur- 
ing slavery, been his peculiar hardship. In his ignorancs he thought the new 
conditions, and especially the privilege of education, were to relieve him from 
this curse of labor. The old negroes went earnestly to work to learn to read. 
They failed, but attributed their failure to lack of early opportunities. But they 
resolved that they would secure education for their children, and, with this 
special end in view, the escape from manual labor. The present generation of 
younger negroes has been educated too much with this purpose in view, and, 
because of this wrong idea, it is true that a smattering of education to many of 
them has caused idleness and laziness. If education is to be given them in any 
liberal sense by the State they must show a much higher appreciation of it. 
They must recognize it not as a means of relief from labor, but as a help to suc- 
cesstul labor. 
“Many-of their best teachers are striving now, by precept and example, to 
correct these wrong ideas as to what education is to do for them, and my earnest 
advice to school committeemen is that they do not employ teachers who are 
above manual labor, A man or a woman who depends upon the money he can 
make by teaching a three or four months school per annum and will not apply 
himself to some useful labor during the balance of the time is not fit to direct 
the education of children and should not be employed to teach. 
“The colored people must not lose sight of the fact that manual labor is the 
lot of almost all people, white and colored, and that this is now and will be their 
lot to a larger degree than that of the white people, because of the peculiar con- 
ditions and circumstances that surround them. The destiny of the negroes of 
the United States is in their hands, with the powerful help of the white people 
as they may show themselves worthy of it. Let them pay their taxes and show 
that education does not spoil them as laborers, at least to any greater degree 
than it does the whites, but that it does add to their efficiency as laborers and 
to their usefulness as moral and upright citizens, and all the help they need 
that the State can, in her financial condition, reasonably afford will be extended 
them. 
“The white people must not'lose sight of the fact that it is the labor of a 
country that makes its wealth, and that, therefore, the education and elevation 
of the children of the laborers is a proper charge upon the property of any 
country. If we did not have the negroes we would have some other poor peo- 
ple, whose children would have to be educated in the public schools. But, what- 
ever may be said about educating the negroes, we can not afford not to improve 
our educational facilities, whether we consider our financial condition and 
progress or the perpetuation of our civil and religious liberties. 
2 “Tf it is said that we are too poor, then I reply that the way to get rich is to 
educate our people intellectually and industrially, so that they may be able suc- 
cessfully to apply labor to the development of our many resources. The history 
-of the world points out this way, and we can not fail if we walk in it. With 
good schools in the country districts there will be less incentive for the country 
_ people to crowd into the cities. and towns to educate their children, much of the 
discontent and restlessness will disappear, and better success will attend their 
labors. 
TENNESSEE. 
Reports of Tennessee county superintendents. 
Marshall County: Our colored schools are improving very fast. At their in- 
stitute this year there was an increase of teachers and an increase in interest. 
All of them seem to be striving for an education, and we have some very bright 
_ minds in the colored race. 
McNairy County: I have held four institutes—three for the whites and one 
for the colored. They were all well attended. We had some excellent workers 
at the normal institute at Purdy in June. I have the colored teachers better 
organized than the whites. 
Morgan County: There ave only forty-seven colored population, and they are 
promiscuously scattered along the railroads; hence no colored schools. 
_~ Tipton County: There seems nothing at present that promises to discourage 
‘the advancement of the public schools in this county further than that there is 
a growing disposition on the part of the white people of the county, who pay °

ninety-five one-hundredths of the taxes, to discontinue the public education of 
the ‘brother in black,” who, notwithstanding the fact that he pays less than 
five one-hundredths of the taxes of our county, receives more than 50 per cent 
of the public-school moneys. This, the white people argue, is wrong, and 
should be remedied ; and I heartily agree with them, and join them also, in the 
further opinion that the negro should bear the burden of his own education. 
Wayne County: Our colored schools are progressing very well. We have 
some very good teachers among the colored population of our county. They 
are creating quite an enthusiasm among their race of people for education. 
“ We can build our own schoothouses.”—The New York Age (edited by a colored 
man): Vast sums have been given by philanthropists to sustain such moral, re- 
ligious, and intellectual work in the Southern States as are usually supplied from 
the general tax funds of the State affected and by the charity of the benevolently 
disposed citizens of such State. The past and the present generations of Afro- 
Americans have, therefore, been educated to look to the Federal Government 
for the protection usually afforded to the citizen by the State in which he resides 
and which does not inhere at all in the Federal authority as one of its conceded 
rights; and, worse yet, they have been educated to look to others to think and 
do for them to such an extent that self-reliance has been hampered in its devel- 
opment, so that if we want money for educational, religious, or other laudable pur- 
poses, we appeal too often to white men or to the Federal Government, instead 
of relying upon ourselves for it and working in combination and codperation to — 
secure it as others do. We can build our own churches and colleges and school- 
houses, and support them, if we would do so, out of the money wasted by us upon 
unnecessary pleasures and upon downright humbug; and we have got to do it 
in the not remote future, because the opinion is steadily gaining vantage that 
we are getting old enough to stand upon our own heels in this matter of self-help. 
II.—SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION, 
OCCUPATIONS OF GRADUATES. 
The question is sometimes asked, What does the colored man do after com- 
pleting a regular course in one of the universities or colleges? In order to an- 
swer this question somewhat definitely, a table has been prepared showing upon 
what lines of business the graduates of 17 institutions reporting this item had 
entered. These 17 institutions represent very fairly the work of the colored 
schools. Howard University is not included in this statement, as a considerable 
portion of its graduates are white. 
The first thing to attract attention is the large number engaged in teaching, 
more than one-half being thus employed. As these institutions were mainly 
founded to supply the demand for competent colored teachers and preachers, 
they seem to have well accomplished their purpose. The whole number of 
graduates of these 17 institutions is 1,542. If from this number we subtract 82 
deceased, 46 engaged in post-graduate studies, 97- married women, and 74 not 
reported, of the remaining 1,243 there are 720, or 58 per cent, engaged in teaching, 
27 of these being professors in colleges and universities. Of preachers there are 
117, or 9 percent; of lawyers, 116; doctors, 163. Five have their whole time em- 
ployed as editors of papers, while others are partly engaged in editing. There 
are 36 in the United States Government service, employed as clerks in the de- 
partments at Washington, as postmasters, as custom-house inspectors, as mail- 
carriers, etc. 
Although in all of the institutions given in the list, without exception, instruc- 
tion was given in different kinds of industrial work, such as carpentry, tinning, 
painting, brickmaking, plastering, shoemaking, tailoring, blacksmithing, farm- 
ing, gardening, etc., and in many of them special attention was given to such in- 
struction; still out of the 1,243 graduates only 12 are farmers, only 1 a carpenter, 
and 2 mechanics. The painters, tinners, brick-makers, shoemakers, plasterers, 
tailors, and blacksmiths seem to have graduated from their trades when the 
left their alma mater. Itshould not be inferred, however, that their handicraft 
availed them nothing, for itis frequently stated in the catalogues that those gradu- 
ates who are engaged in teaching so long as the school term continues immediately 
enter upon their trades at the close of the term. The evidence of the table, 
however, is that a full collegiate education tends to draw away the colored stu- 
dent from the class of pursuits mentioned and to lead him into professional 
work ; and as greater opportunities are annually being offered him for medical 
and legal education the number iy these professions is yearly increasing.

    Ee” EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1083 
COLLEGIATE STUDENTS. 
The number of universities and colleges for the education of the colored race 
given in the tables of 1889-90 is 22, with an attendance of 811 students. The 
number of institutions is the same as reported in 1888-89, but in the number of 
students there is quite a reduction. This reduction is owing to the fact that 
students in the preparatory departments have been classed under the list of in- 
stitutions for secondary instruction. It is well known that in many of the colored ~ 
universities and colleges there are only a dozen or so of students in the college’ 
grade, while there are, perhaps, s2veral hundred in the preparatory and primary 
grades. ‘To include the latter among university and college students would be 
misleading. é 
On this point President Horace Bumstead, of Atlanta University, says: ‘‘Itis 
a mistake to suppose that the higher education of the colored people is being 
overdone. Thereis a very grave misapprehension on that point among the good 
people of our land. We have so many institutions in the South that are named — 
universities and colleges that the idea prevails that all the students in these in- 
stitutions are learning Latin and Greek and the higher mathematics and getting 
in general the higher education. This is notso. Dr. Haygood afew years ago _ 
investigated this matter with some care and arrived at the conclusion that in 
these institutions with the high-sounding names not over 5 per cent of the pu- 
pils are really getting a strictly ‘higher education.’ Commissioner Harris 
thinks there may be a3 many as 10 per cent, but even that is a very small-pro-. 
ortion. 
‘Take Atlanta University, for instance. We have had this last year about 
600 students enrolled, whose names are printed in our catalogue. How many of 
these are getting the higher education? Just 20 of them are in the college 
course; 51 more are in the college preparatory course ; 71 out of 600 are getting 
the higher education, and this is probably a larger proportion than can be 
found in almost any other institution in the South. When one remembers the 
comparatively small number of the colored people who are in these schools and 
then considers the small proportion of those in them who are getting the higher 
education it does not seem as though the thing were being overdone.” + ne 
In 1888-89 the number of institutions for secondary instruction was 53 and the 
  number of students 11,480; in 1889-90 the number of institutions was 71 and of 
students 12,420, an increase of about 1,000. This inerease is to be accounted for, 
to some extent, in the same way as the decrease in the number of university and 
college students, viz, the including college preparatory students in the tables of 
secondary institutions. 2 
Hence, although there was apparently a decrease in the number of collegiate 
students, it was only an apparent one; but at the same time the actual number _ 
given is so small that it may wellserve to stimulate the friends of colored educa- oe 
tion to renewed efférts in their behalf. 
In the number of theological students there was apparently a decrease, but 
there was an increase of about one-third in the number of both law and medical 
students. 
The value of the grounds and buildings of the 22 universities and colleges, as 
reported, was over $2,700,000, but only a few of them had any endowment fund, 
the endowment funds of all of them only aggregating $807,425. Benefactions to’ 
the amount of $167,591 were received during the year. Only three of them re- _ 
ceived any State aid—Southern University, New Orleans, $7,500; Wilberforce 
University, Ohio, $6,000; and Claflin University, South Carclina, $10,800. The 
tuition fees received by all of them only aggregated $47,216. Without the aid 
extended by missionary societies and other benevolent funds they would have 
labored under great difficulties. The American Missionary Association was one _ 
of the largest contributors towards the support of these schools. It gave help to — 
six chartered institutions—Fisk University, Atlanta University, Talladega Col-, 
lege, Tougaloo University, Straight University, Tillotson Normal Institute— 
with 2,871 students in all the departments ; also to 2lnormal and graded schools, 
with 5,797 students, and to53 common schools, with 4,727 pupils. The Freedmen’s 
Aid and Southern Education Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church also _ 
contributed a large amount towards the education of the colored race, but it is 
impossible to determine the amount accurately, as the expenditures for institu- 
tions of the white race and for ministers’ salaries are included in the same ac- 
counts with those for colored schools. The whole amount disbursed from the 
Slater fund from 1883 to 1891, inclusive, was $321,991.

  The sum of $47,428.27 was received from the income of the Daniel Hand fund, 
and was used in extending aid to deserving and promising students, in provid~ 
ing good school buildings at different places, and in securing teachers for places 
where they could not otherwise be obtained. 
The Daniel Hand fund at the time it was granted consisted of interest-bearing 
securities to the amount of $1,000,894.25. It was placed in charge 0! the Ameri- 
can Missionary Association, and only the income of it is to be used. The bonds 
and property are ‘‘to be received and held by said American Missionary Associ- 
ation wpon trust, and for the following purposes, viz: To safely manage the said 
trust fund, to change investments whenever said association may deem it neces- 
sary or advisable, to reinvest the principal of said trust fund in such securities, 
property, and investments as said association may deem best, and to use the in- 
come thereof only for the education of colored people of African descent resid- 
ing in the recent slave States of the United States of America hereinbefore 
specified. 
‘*Such income to be applied for the education of such colored people as are 
needy and indigent, and such as by their health, strength, and vigor of body and 
mind give indications of efficiency and usefulness in after life.” 
In December, 1891, at his home in Guilford, Conn., occurred the death of Mr. 
Daniel Hand, the donator of the above fund, who with intelligent foresight gave 
- from the living hand that which probably for years to come will confer its bene- 
fits upon deserving youth.’ 
      
1“ Daniel Hand was born in Madison, Conn., July 16, 1801, and was therefore in the eighty- 
eighth year of his age when he made his gift for the education of the colored people at the South. 
His ancestors resided in that town for several generations, and were always landholders, in- 
- dustrious, quiet, and respectable. ‘fo this ancestry Mr. Hand is probably indebted under God 
for his physical vigor, long life, strength of character, and success in business. He was the 
fourth son of seven, and was on the farm under his father’s direction until he was 16 years 
of age, when he was put in charge of his second brother, Augustus F. Hand, who was then a 
merchant at Augusta, Ga., and whom he succeeded in business. In 1854 Mr. Hand went to New 
York in connection with his Southern business, and remained there in that capacity until the 
beginning of the war in 1861. He resided in some portion of the Southern Confederacy during 
the entire war, and was never treated with violence in any way, and no Confederate officer ever 
offered him indignity or even an unkind word. 
_ _ “Mr. George W. Williams, a native Georgian, was, at about the age of 16, employed by Mr. 
Hand as a clerk in Augusta, and in a few years was taken in as partner. Mr. Williams sug- 
gested a branch of the business in Charleston, and conducted it successfully. When the war 
came on Mr. Hand’s capital was largely engaged in the Charleston business; which Mr. Wil- liams, as a Southern man, continued, having the use of Mr. Hand’s capital, which the Confed- 
erate government vainly endeavored to confiscate by legal proceedings against Mr. Hand asa 
Northern manof pronounted antislavery sentiments, After the war Mr. Hand came Northand 
left it to his old partner, Mr. Williams, to adjust the business and make up the accounts, allow- 
ing him almost unlimited time for so doing. When this was accomplished Mr. Williams came 
- North and paid over to Mr. Hand his portion of the long-invested capital and its accumulations. 
‘Mr. Hand, having been early deprived by death of wife and children, decided to devote a 
share of his large fortune to benevolent purposes. At one time he intended to make bequests 
to some Northern colleges, but at length, recalling the fact that his property was accumulated 
in Ae South, and knowing so well the needs of the ignorant negroes, he turned his attention 
to them. - “The well-known and magnificent gift of $1,000,894.25, October 24, 1838, to the American Mis- 
sqnBry. Association, for the benefit of the colored people of the Southern States, was the re- 
sult.”

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1085 
George R. Smith College, Sedalia, Mo.—On March 27, 1888, two daughters of 
Gen. George R. Smith, Madams Smith and Cotton, donated 25 acres of land, 
valued at $25,000, in Sedalia, Mo., for the establishment of an institution of learn- 
ing for the colored race, on condition that a $25,000 building should be erected 
on it by January 1,1892. The building was partially erected within the required 
time, but the donors kindly extended the time to January 1,1894. As the insti- 
tution is to be in charge of the Freedmen’s Aid and Southern Education Society 
of the M. E. Church, it will very probably be completed within the required 
time. It will be the first institution of higher grade in Missouri for colored 
people. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
In nearly all, if not all, of the institutions for the secondary and higher edu- — 
cation of the colored race of the South industrial training forms a very im- 
portant part. It is one of the conditions required before aid can be received 
from the John F. Slater fund. The cost of its introduction was very consider- 
able, in the purchase of sufficient grounds, in the erection of suitable buildings, 
and securing the necessary machinery and apparatus for the different kinds of 
work. And not only was its introduction expensive, but its maintenance as 
woll, for it has not been the purpose to make profits, or even in many cases to 
meet expenses, but to impart the largest amount of useful and practical knowl- 
edge and to train in habits of carefulness, diligence, and order. But at the 
same time many indigent students were instructed in branches of industry by 
which they were soon able to. contribute largely towards defraying their ex- 
penses, and afterwards toearna good livelihood. It was found, too, that the phys- 
ical exercise and the temporary mental diversion from studies was very conducive 
to health and vigor and was a source of enjoyment to students, while it in no way © 
hindered progress in their studies. It also indicated that hard labor on the 
farm or in the workshop was not to be confined to the ignorant, poverty-stricken 
wretch, but that there was nothing in it inconsistent with an educated, progres- 
sive, Christian character. 
As to industrial training, Dr. A. G. Haygood, general agent of the Slater fund, 
says: ‘‘ The essential goodness of industrial training in connection with the ordi- 
nary school training is now universally admitted by experienced and practical 
people. In the schools aided by the Slater fund during the school year 1889-90 
as many as ten thousand young people were taught in books and in some branch 
of useful industries. This sort of training is vital now. Mere book schooling 
with poor and illiterate people breeds wants faster than it develops the ability to 
provide for them. The outcome is misery. Tool-craft helps to realize the aspi- 
rations that book learning inspires.”

NEED OF GREATER ACCOMMODATIONS. Si 
Tho number of students in the colleges and schools for secondary instruction 
of the colored race does not show the rapid increase from year to year which — 
would naturally be expected, when we consider the large number of children 
that have been attending the common schools, many of whom should now be 
qualified for entering higher institutions. But an examination of the reports of 
colored schools and of journalsdevoted to colored education soon discloses one- 
reason why thereis not the increase expected, viz, the want of accommodations 
for more students, Many ofthe colored schools of higher grade are already badly — 
overcrowded ; some of them are so crowded as to seriously endanger the health of — 
thestudentsand hundreds of others have been refused admission onaccount of want 
of room, while others still have not applied because they already knew there was’ _ 
- no place for them. Very few new schools of the higher grades are established 
for colored students,as the colored people themselves have not the means for doing | 
so, and the missionary societies generally content themselves with sustaining orat _ 
least strengthening the institutions they haye already established. Many ofthe — 
schools adopt all sorts of expedients to make room for applicants begging for © 
admission, allowing them to s’eep on cots in the halls, making use of old build- : 
ings which had been discarded as no longer fit for occupancy, and very generally 
crowding the students in excessive numbers in the buildings designed for them. 
Judging from the accounts given it would seem reasonable to suppose that the 
number of colored students would be largely increased immediately if there-were _ 
accommodations for them. A want of accommodations is especially to be regret- 
ted when it is considered how anxious the young men and women are to receive 
an education and what sacrifices both students and parents willingly make in 
order that they may receive one. 
A few quotations on this subject are given from various sources, Dr. C. H. 
Parkhurst, editor of Zion’s Herald, says: ‘‘We should have ten schcols where

  we now have one. Every institution is crowded to overflowing. If God is say- _ 
ing anything in this jubilee hour to the chureh it is, enlarge, enlarge, enlarge - 
your beneficence; enlarge the scope of operation; enlarge the teaching and 
poarding capability. We rejoice over the achievements of these twenty-five 
years; but at the same time we are humbled that the church has done so little.” 
_ Morristown Normal Academy, Tennessee; number of students, 306.—‘* This insti- 
tution is situated in the midst of a colored population of not less than 250,000. 
To meet the educational requirements of this vast number of people, there is 
only one other school of a similar grade within a radius of 300 miles. The peo- 
ple are realizing, as never before, their great need of an education, and are 
crowding every room to its utmost capacity. Last year scores of bright, earn- 
est, and self-sacrificing young people were sent away for want of room.” 
“The present dormitory is entirely too small for the number of students 
crowded intoit. For the last two years we have been compelled to put three 
students in each bed, and to place cots in the halls. Even then it was difficult 
to satisfy applicants that we were crowded and could not accommodate them.” 
Grand View, Tenn.—‘‘ The classes are full and the accommodations inadequate. 
The school numbers one hundred and eleven. It is necessary to crowd four boys 
- into each room of the boys’ hall. Four boys are boarding themselves in a 
shackly log building at the foot of the hill. Their grit is admirable.” 
- Tougaloo, Miss.—‘ Both the dormitories are crowded. The ladies’ hall is sup- 
posed to accommedate 75 girls. One hundred and six are crowded into itto-day. 
‘We have turned away nearly one hundred more because we had not room for 
them. Every indication is that the crowd of applicants will be greater next 
year thanever. Already applications are coming in.” 
Meridian, Miss.—‘‘ The work of the school is hindered by lack of room. We 
have enrolled this year 232 pupils, and many have been turned off because we 
could not seat them. We opened in December of 1888 with 28 pupils. A school 
for more advanced pupils is needed in this part of Mississippi. We have 30 
young people in school who come from the five adjoining counties.” 
Straight University,’ New Orleans.—‘‘It has been a golden year for Straight 
University. Financially it has been our best year. A larger proportion of stu- 
dents able to pay came to us. We want to grow, and have every opportunity to 
do so save that our quarters are too small. We have turned away during the 
year probably 200 applicants, many of them for the boarding department. We 
have had to put cots in nearly all the rooms, packing them too full for comfort, 
as it was very hard to say No to young people who came hundreds of miles and 
begged tearfully for admission. The school has grown during the last eight 
years from 200 to 600 and is not 1,000 only because we had no room for them. 
Our graduates are filling important positions allover the South. Several are 
superintendents in Texas, Kansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. One holds an 
important office in Honduras; others are doing good work in Cuba and Mexico. 
Kight are filling important positions in this city. We have no trouble in get- 
ting positions for our young people. Indeed, we can not supply as fast as de- 
manded. Oftea as many as twenty are called for when we have none to send.” 
Bennett College, Greensboro, N. C.—‘‘ Our chief need is a new dormitory building. 
The present building, though large, is far too small for the increasing demands 
upon us for more commodious quarters. Students are pouring in upon us every 
day, and still we hear of others coming.” 
Wiley University, Marshall, Tex.—‘‘ There should be at once erected a large 
central building, which would be at once filled with students.” 
Gilbert Academy, Winsted, La.—‘‘ We could have an attendance of a thousand 
students within a year if we had buildings to accommodate them.” 
Central Tennessee College.—‘‘ The attendance during the past year (1889-90) is 
such as to encourage the thought that the desire for education, and that more 
advanced, is growing rather than diminishing among the colored people. The 
number in attendance during the past year has tested our buildings to their utmost 
capacity. We need additional accommodations. This educational work has 
really just begun, and the outlook is that all our schools will be crowded more 
andmore. Weneedanewchapel. Our present one is not sufficiently large to seat 
our students. We have been compelled to fill up the platform and crowd every 
seat, and yet have not room for all our students. We need a larger chapel for 
our ordinary purposes, and a much larger one for our public occasions.”    
    
1In January, 1892, the main building of Straight University, New Orleans, La., was consumed 
by fire. Fortunately, however, the property was adequately insured, and a larger structure ie

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1093 
‘For our young women we need dormitories; and for the purpose of teaching, 
cooking, nursing, domestic economy, we need enlarged facilities. Weneed these, 
not for our necessary school purposes only, but to create a desire for neatness 
and pleasant surroundings in the homes that these young women are to makein 
the future. The need of additional buildings is more especially evident when 
itis understood that every room on the grounds is occupied by students or teach- 
ers.” 
From the Daniel Hand School, New Orleans.—Itis the old story—200 turned away ~ : 
for lack of room. A few have come from the country without ever thinking 
that they might not find a place, and stand hopelessly on the street corner talk- 
ing it over. 
Aeicitien teacher says: ‘‘ We are crowded to overflowing in every grade of the 
school. but one, in which we have three unoccupied seats. In the normal depart- 
ment twenty pupils are without desks, Yesterday one of the ministers of the 
city applied for admission of his two daughters, who had completed the course 
in the public schools—just the class of pupils we like to have come—but I could ~ 
not admit them for want of room.” 
From report of President T. D. Tucker, of Florida State Normal College for Col- 
ored Students.—‘‘ The surest test of the appreciation of the race for the school is” 
in the sacrifices made by patrons in sending and maintaining scholars here and 
the eagerness of the latter to avail themselves of the opportunity offered them 
for instruction. With limited means or from daily earnings parents send their 
children to this school from distant parts of the State, and meet all the financial 
engagements incident to the education of a young person during the entire ses- 
sion of nine months. Although this is the second year since the school has had 
dormitory halls, not only has every patron met all his obligations, but the de- 
mand for more room in the dormitories is restricted by our inability to provide 
for any more newcomers. 
“The promptness and regularity of attendance at the daily sessions of the 
scheol is another proof of high appreciation. Noseverer punishment for breach 
of discipline can be inflicted on any of them than to be ordered to leave school 
for even partofaday. They seem to feel that every day and hour are too pre- 
cious to be lost from the prosecution of the purpose for which they have come 
hither from their homes. This strong regard and attachment for a school but 
lately established is one of the most pleasing features, which promise for it, let 
it be hoped, a long career of usefulness. * * * Wherever the services of our 
undergraduates have been once had, there they are held most in demand—a tes- 
timonial to their efficiency and the need of them as workers in the common 
schools.” 
From report of the American Missionary Association committee in 1891.—‘‘ The 
total number under instruction during the year has increased by several hun- 
dred, and almost every school is crowded to overflowing, compelling in many 
eases the sad necessity of sending away great numbers of applicants from laclx 
of room for their accommodation. It is evident that the thirst of the colored 
people for knowledge, shown so remarkably from the moment of their emanci- 
pation, has not diminished, but is constantly increasing.” 
  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING, 
At Claflin University, Soutk Carolina, a large number of students were in- 
structed in trades and industries; in agriculture, including gardening and horti- 
culture, 40 students; in architectural drawing, 13; in art needlework, 20; in 
blacksmithing, 98; in brickmaking, bricklaying, plastering; and frescoing, 92; 
in carpentry and cabinetmaking, 1&5; in cooking, 35; crocheting and lacemak- 
ing, 120; domestic economy, 13; dressmaking, 36; mechanical engineering, 15; 
merchandising, 1; nurse-training, 14; painting, graining,and glazing, 81; print- 
ing, 69; steam laundrying, 50; steam planing, sawing, turning, 26; steam mill- 
ing, grinding cereals, 4; shoemaking, 21; plain sewing, 190. 
President L. M. Dunton, of Claflin University, says: ‘‘In the past the negro 
has been a laborer. For years to come he must be a laborer. A few of course 
will be educated and will enter the ministry, the law, the medical profession ; 
but the vast majority must labor with their hands. It is therefore very impor- 
tant to give them this manual training. We are very enthusiastic about this, 
and we do not allow any young woman to graduate until she can measure, cut, 
fit, and make a dress, and make it in style. They alsolearn cooking and artistic 
needlework. The young men are required tu learn the principles of different 
trades, and to learn one trade thoroughly. We require a certificate from some

094 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
one of the industrial departments that they have accomplished the required work 
before they can graduate from the institution. During the vacations these young 
men and women work at these trades that they have learned at the institution. 
_ We have boys now earning a dollar and a half a day at house painting, others 
earning $2 a day laying brick or at carpentry. In our blacksmith department 
they make all the tools they use ; they even make their own razors. This in- 
dustrial feature has been an inspiration to the literary department.” 
At Gilbert Academy, Winsted, La., there are 12 students in the printing office, 
- 14 in the carpenter shop, 16 on the farm, 53 girls in the sewing room, 3 in the 
bakery, besides a large number in the laundry. 
Philander Smith College, Little Rock, Ark.—‘t The industrial department is car- _ 
ried on in a two-story frame building erected by the students. In this depart- 
ment there are1l4. The citizens of Little Rock have given over $800 towards 
paying for the building. A large number of young men have been taught the 
use of tools. In the printing department several young men and young ladies 
chaye been taught.” 
Rust University, MississippiiIn the carpenter shop 35 young men were in- 
structed in the use of tools and methods of construction, from the most common 
articles in use in home and on farm to fine cabinet work. ‘Twenty-seven were 
taught shoemaking, from the making of cheap shoes to the finest French kid 
boot. Eleven were instructed in the printing office, and a monthly paper was 
published. The young men below the college course, who were not assigned to 
some trade, were put in the department of agriculture. In the sewing depart- 
ment 102 girls received useful instruction in that line. 
Clark-University, Atlanta, Ga.—‘‘At Clark University we have one of the best 
located as well as one of the best equipped industrial schools south of the Ohio. 
We have one large brick building, Ballard Hall, 100 by 40 feet. The first floor 
is divided into two parts; one-half is occupied by the wheelwright shop. The 
second floor is divided into four rooms, one occupied by the printing office, one 
by the varnish and finishing department, another by the harness and trimming 
shop, while the rémaining one is devoted to an office and mechanical drafting. 
‘The machinery is driven by a 30 horse-power engine. We have a blacksmith 
_ shop 40 by 30 fect, brick, three forges, drills, benches, ete. We have afoundry, 
- 60 by 40 fect, supplied with the latest improved cupola. 
“The Woman’s Home Missionary Society has a building worth $6,000, built 
after the best models and thoroughly equipped with appliances for teaching in 
- the culinary department, needlework, dressmaking, and all that a wife in a well- 
regulated home ought to know. The university physician has a class in nurse- 
training in this home also. A shoe shop and a machine shop are among the 
things now under contemplation.” 
Central Tennessee College.—‘‘On October 15, 1890, the mechanic arts shop was 
dedicated to the training of young men for useful work in wood, iron, brass, and 
steel; in the manufacture of steam engines, scientific, and philosophical appara- 
tus. Rev. H.G. Sedgwick, M.s., who is a genius himself in mechanics and can 
readily impart instruction to others, has during the year had excellent work 
_ done by students in wood-turning, shaping and planing, castings, steel, and 
prass. One engine has been built and considerable repair work done. This is 
the best shop, and the only one of the kind, open to colored youth in this 
country. i 
Dr. Vitieus G. Haygood, general agent of the Slater fund, says: ‘It has been 
- demonstrated that an hour or two a day in the workshop or the sewing room 
does not hinder in the least education in books. It has been found, as a rule, 
that the best men in the shop are the leaders in the classroom. Experienced 
teachers say that industrial training fosters good discipline and ‘the upbuilding 
of strong and reliable personal character. Outside the important fact that a 
great number have learned enough of the trades to pursue them profitably, it is 
certain that thousands have learned enough to be independent as citizens and 
far more capable as heads of families. That ‘head, heart, and hand training’ 
should go on together in these institutions is now the accepted doctrine in all 
uarters. 
Z “Tt cannot be doubted that the success of industrial training in the negro 
schools has had much to do with the development of opinion throughout the 
Southern States of the importance of this part of education in the white schools 
of the country.” 
Gen. S.C. Armstrong on industrial training.—‘‘ Labor is a great moral and. edu- 
cational force. Next to the grace of God, hard work, in its largest sense, is the 
most vital thing in Christian civilization. Subtract from any neighborhood, -

    EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE, 
within a radius of ten miles, all industry, and in six months, inspite of churches _ 
and schools, what would hecome of order and decency? Look at the fairest ciy- Re 
ilization, and you will see that the worst lives are at the top and at the bottom— 
those who are too rich and those whe are too worthless to work. Wherever — 
you find industry you find character and morality. “3 
“The main thing, then, in the industrial system is to open as widely and — 
broadly as possible opportunities for agricultural, mechanical,and household in-- 
dustries, which shall provide negro students means to support themselves and 
to develop character. Character is the foundation. The training that our pu- ~ 
pils get isan endowment. .An able-bodied student represents a capital of per- 
haps a thousand dollars. We propose to treble that. When they learn a trade 
they are worth threefold more in the labor market. Last Saturday I gave my 
final words to our graduating c'ass. I said to those 45 scholars, ‘ How many of 
you can go out into the world, and, if you can not get aschool, how many can 
work in some line of industry and sosupport yourselves?’ There was a roar. 
Every one said, ‘I can,’ and every one laughed. They go out into the world 
smiling at difficulties, happy in their pluck and purpose and skill. 
““We are convinced that the negro needs physical as well as mental and 
Christian training. He needs the ten hours’ drudgery which he gets in the 
shops to put him in shape for-the struggle of life. He must go to his work with 
an appetite.” : 
Rev. R. H. Allen, Concord, N. C.—‘‘We have now a large boarding school — 
for colored girls. If you ever save the negroes you must save the girls and 
women. You will not elevate any race until wives and mothers can teach the ~ 
gospel in their families, You must save the daughters of the freedmen. They — 
are to be the wives and mothers and home-makers of the future. At Concord: — 
you will see 234 girls in aseminary, with all the appliances for education and the — 
industriai arts. They do the whole work of the school—all the washing, iron- — 
ing, cooking, scrubbing, and dressmaking. We.take a girl for $45 a year. We ~ 
say to her, Go to work during the vacation and make $15 or $20 and we will help 
you to the balance of the $45. In such schools, by a practical education of the 
head, hand, and heart, the girls are all well prepared to take their part in life, 
We help them to make character.” z 
' Rev. Frank G. Woodworth, president Tougaloo University, Mississippi. The — 
ordinary laborers on plantations do not often receive more than from 75 to 90 
cents per day. I want to speak of the value of industrial education. Boys who 
come to us untrained, often able to earn only 75 cents a day, are sent out as car- 
penters, blacksmiths, or tinsmiths, able to earn from $1.25 to $2.50 aday. We 
are haying that repeated constantly. That is the bread-and-butter view of in- ~ 
dustrial education, and it is worthy of mention. The mechanics who receive $2 — 
a day do not live ina one-room cabin. They are getting to have good little 
homes of their own.” 
The higher education helps the elementary.—President Horace Bumstead, of 
Atlanta University: ‘It is a mistake to forget that the higher education of the 
few is contributing most efficiently to the elementary education of the many. 
What are the graduates of these higher institutions doing? Are they going 
out and enjoying their culture, and making a selfish use of it? Take Atlanta 
University. We have sent out, in the last 16 or 18 years, over 200 graduatesfrom 
our collegiate and normal courses, two-thirds of whom are to-day engaged in 
teaching. They are doing this very work that we are reminded is the most 
  important work to do—helping up the masses, educating the people. One musi _ 
remember the relationship between the higher and the more elementary work. 
Where would these Southern States get their teachers for the colored public _ 
schools if it were not for these higher institutions?” 
Colored teachers wanted.—President E. C. Mitchell, of Leland University, New 
Orleans: ‘More colored teachers must be educated. The appeals made to our 
institution to furnish teachers qualified for the higher work, or even the com- 
mon work, are far beyond the power we have to mect. If we had four times as 
many graduates, we should not be able to meet the demand made upon us for 
teachers of the higher grade. All the institutions of the South must be carried > ; 
on by colored teachers.” 
hat kind of education the negro needs.—Dr. A. G. Haygood : ‘That many half- 
taught and unwisely-taught negroes ‘go to the bad’ and seck money by ‘short 
cuts’is not surprising. In these matters the negro’s weakness illustrates his 
brotherhood to his white neighbors. The prisons show enough half-educated 
white people to prove that merely learning the rudiments does not secure virtue. 
         
-P-A-G-E-504
    1096 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  Tn all races it is true that with new knowledge new temptations come; strength 
to resist comes after, if at-all. In all this a man of sense’ finds no argument 
against the education of the negro, but a demonstration of the need, for him and 
for the white race, of more and better education. 
“ ‘Better’ isnot the same as ‘more;’ the imminent need for the negro is to 
find out what education is now fittest for him. Nothing in these statements 
means the exclusion of the negro from the highest and widest studies of which 
some of them are capable; it does mean, as I see it, that the ‘regulation college 
curriculum’ is not what most negro students need. I would exclude, by arbi- 
trary and prescriptive rules, no negro from whatever he can achieve, but J am 
persuaded that, in overlooking the hard facts of this case and in pressing the 
college’ idea overmuch, there has been much waste of money, labor, time, op- 
portunity. 
“The educated negro man gravitates to the pulpit or the schoolroom. ‘To the 
pulpit first, because here he may gratify, without hindrance, his inborn love of 
speaking. He is oratorical by instinct, and this race will more and more de- 
velop great orators. The educated negro woman goes to the schoolroom by 
preference, but she would rather be wife tothe preacher. Along here are perils 
that wise negroes understand. 
‘Why should such indications and tendencies surprise us? No man lives by 
the labor of his hands who can live by his wits, least of all American white men. 
The negro’s dangers are greater because his opportunities outside the labor of 
hishands arefew. No arguments, nor frettings, nor denunciations, nor laws, 
nor force can multiply them; time and new conditions, possible only to the 
‘time element,’ can increase them. 
“The educated negro finds it difficult to succeed in the practice of law. White 
people employ attorneys of their own race, and a negro will have none buta 
white man for lawyer when large sums are at stake, or life or liberty are im- 
periled. But he has ‘ made a be¥inning’ in the law. 
“Next to teaching and preaching, medicine among professional pursuits offers 
the best field and the best opportunity for the capable negro. The reason is, 
there is a generally recognized and felt need of negro doctors. Two of the insti- 
tutions in connection with the Slater fund—Meharry Medical College, Nash- 
ville, Tenn., and Leonard Medical School, Raleigh, N. C.—are thoroughgoing 
schools of medicine and command the respect of the medical profession, The 
large majority of the graduates of the schools are doing admirably in the prac- 
tice of medicine. They are a blessing to their race and are successful and use- 
ful citizens.” 
The following, from the Charleston (S. C.) News and Courier, gives some idea 
of how the negro appreciates an education at Claflin University, South Carolina: 
‘The students come from all parts of the State, and a better class of colored 
families are represented than usual. From the number of students (902), their 
condition and their work, it would seemas if the colored people are taking more 
than ordinary interest in the cause of education. Many parents are making 
great sacrifices to send their children to Claflin, and many of the students are in 
much better circumstances than their parents at home. ‘The students lack early 
home training. They do not have access to daily papers, magazines, or books 
like most white children. As a rule subjects of importance and interest are not 
discussed in the family circle, and on account of these drawbacks the colored 
student labors under disadvantages. <A lack of general information is noted by 
the professor. Their behavior is, as a rule, very good. There is not, in the 
knowledge of the officials of the institution, a single student who visits a bar- 
room, smokes in the campus or in the streets. 
‘*A student probably has less expense at Claflin than at any other educational 
institutionin thecountry. .Think of it—all actual expenses for a session covered 
by $52! What can be cheaper? This is popular education. The figures seem 
to be hardly credible. Here is the itemized bill for amonth: Rent, $1; inciden- 
tals, 50 cents; tuition, 50 cents; board, $3.50; washing, $1; total, $6.50 per month 
and $52 per session. You may think that dormitory rent at $1 and washing at 
$1 are reasonable. But you, as many others, will ask how can a living working 
being be fed for $3.50? Well, it is done at Claflin, and here is how it is accom- 
plished. Fifty students club together and get a table’ at the dining hall for 
which they pay norent. They are not afraid of work and agree to do all the 
washing, waiting, and setting of tables in turn. A purchasing committee is ap- 
pointed, and they have potatoes, meat, corn, and rice at the cheapest market 
price. The only expense besides the food is that of acook. Itseems almost in- 
ees but the students eat substantial meals and the bill of fare shows what 
they eat.

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1097 
From the report of the American Missionary Association committee in 1891.—“‘ One 
of the greatest needs of the colored people is coming to be that of competent, 
educated, Christian leaders of their own race, preachers, teachers, and other 
professional men, a need not likely to be adequately supplied except by the col- 
leges and higher schools sustained by this and other Christian bodies. It may 
be safely assumed from the history of other races that no leadership will be per- 
manently accepted by the colored. people except such as shall come from their 
own ranks. In furnishing through its higher institutions such a thoroughly 
equipped leadership to take the place of its own at the earliest moment, this as- 
sociation will make one of its best contributions to the welfare of the colored 
race. Another encouraging fact in the same direction is the growing interest 
in the theological department. As an ignorant ministry has been and still-is 
the curse of the colored people, a thoroughly educated ministry is the highest 
boon we can possibly confer upon them.” 
“Straight University has numbered 582 students, who come from a wide area. 
It is not uncommon for students who can speak no English to seek this institu- 
tion from Cuba, Central America, Mexico, or some parts of Louisiana. It ig an 
inspiring thought that they will return to their homes, as some have returned, 
with Christ in their hearts and thrifty thoughts in their heads to radiate good. 
influences in those revolutionary states. This institution has been more than 
filled. Hundreds have been refused admission. Every year shows marked im- 
provement in the quality of student life in this, as in all our schools. Pupils 
come better prepared. They are more earnest and more energetic. The de- 
mand for teachers from this institution is greater than the supply. Seventeen 
of its former students are now teaching in the city schools of New Orleans. 
Many others are filling important places as teachers, superintendents, and 
preachers in neighboring States. Various industries for men and all kinds of 
needlework and housework for women are well taught.” 
Temperance is taught in all the higher colored schools.—Rey. J.C. Roy: “In all of 
these schools the principle of temperance is taught and the students go out and   
propagate these sentiments among their people. In this.way they produce an 
immense amount of temperance sentiment among the colored folks.” 
The Negro Conference at Tuskegee, Ala.—A negro conference made up of rep- 
resentatives from that district of the South known as the ‘‘Black Belt” was — 
held at Tuskegee, Ala., on February 23, 1892. About 450 colored farmers, min- 
isters, and teachers were present, and a full and candid discussion was had 
of questions affecting the industrial, moral, educational and religious future of 
the negro population. 
In dealing with the question of the proper means to be adopted for the cor- 
rection of the existing unsatisfactory order of things, the conference suggested 
various remedies,which may be summarized, in the language of those assembled, 
as follows: 
“(1) That, as far as possible,we aim to raise at home our own meatand bread. 
(2) That as fast as possible we buy land, even though a very few acres at a time. 
(8) That a large number of our young people be taught trades and that they be 
urged to prepare themselves to enter as largely as possible all the various avo- 
cations of life. (4) That we especially try to broaden the field of labor for our 
women. (5) That we make every sacrifice and practise every form of economy 
that we may purchase land and free ourselves from our burdensome habit of liv- — 
ing indebt. (6) That we urge our ministers and teachers to give more attention 
to the material condition and home life of the people. (7) We urge that our 
people do not depend entirely upon the State to provide schoolhouses and 
Jengthen the time of the schools, but that they take hold of the matter them- 
selves where the State leaves off, and by supplementing the public funds from 
their own pockets and by building schoolhouses bring about the desired results. 
(8) We urge patrons to give earnest attention to the mental and moral fitness\of 
those who teach their schools. (9) That we urge the doing away with all secta- 
rian prejudice in the management of schools.” 
The Lake Mohonk Conference.—In June, 1891, there was held at Lake Mohonk, 
N. Y., a conference of distinguished editors and educators on the negro question. 
It was presided over by ex-President Hayes, and among those present were Dr. 
Lyman Abbott, of the Christian Union; Dr. W. H. Ward, of the Independent; 
Dr. W. T. Harris, United States Commissioner of Education; Gen. O. O. How- 
ard, Dr. Charles H. Hall, Mr. Morris K. Jessup, and Rev. R. T. Middleditch, of 
the Christian Enquirer, At the conclusion of the conference the following plat- 
form was adopted.

HAMPTON NORMAL AND AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE. 
A pamphlet has been published giving a sketch of the twenty-two years’ work 
of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, Hampton, Va., a full and 
‘extended account of which is soon to be issued. As this institution has a very 
important part in the work of educating the colored race, having been one of 
’ the pioneer colored schools, and having at the present time nearly 1,000 students 
in attendance, 650 of whom are boarding pupils, it may be well to learn from 
this pamphlet something of the character which was so active in its establish- 
ment and also of the early history of the enterprise. 
Dr. S. C. Armstrong, who has had charge of the institute from its foundation, 
was born in the Hawaiian Islands in 1839. His parents had been missionaries 
' there for eight years at the time of his birth, and his father was the minister of pub- 
lic instruction from 1847 till the time of his death, in 1860. Dr. S.C. Armstrong, 
then a young man, left the islands and went to Williams College, Massachusetts, 
to complete his education, and he attributes whatever measure of success he has 
attained to the instruction there received from Dr. Mark Hopkins. When he 
undertook the work at Hampton his purpose was to put in operation there the 
same plan and system of education that he had become acquainted with in the 
Hawaiian Islands under his father’ssuperintendence. His statement of the dis- 
ordered condition of the country at that time shows that he had many serious 
difficulties to contend with. 
“In March, 1866, Iwas placed by Gen. O. O. Howard, Commissioner of the 
_ Freedmen’s Bureau, in charge of ten counties in eastern Virginia, with head- 
quarters at Hampton, the great contraband camp, to manage negro affairs and 
to adjust, if possible, the relations of the races. 
* Colored squatters by thousands and Gen. Lee’s disbanded soldiers returning 
to their families, came together in my district on hundreds of abandoned farms 
which Government had seized and allowed the freedmen to occupy. There was 
irritation, but both classes were ready to do the fair thing. It was about a two 
_ years’ task to settle matters by making terms with the landowners, who employed 
“many laborers on their restored homes. Swarms went back on passes to the ‘old 
iantation’ with thirty days’ rations, and nearly a thousand were placed in fami- 
' lies in Massachusetts as servants through the agency of a ‘home’ in Cambridge- 
port, under charge of a committee of Boston ladies. : 
_ * Hardest of all was to settle the ration question; about 2,000, having been fed 
for years, were demoralized andseemed hopeless. Notice was given that in three 
months, on October 1, 1866, all rations would be stopped, except to those in hospital, 
for whom full provision was made. Trouble was expected, but there was not a 
ripple of itor a complaint that day. Their resource was surprising. The negro 
in a tight place is a genius. : 
“Tt was my duty every three months to personally visit and report on the con- 
dition of the ten counties; to inspect the bureau office in each in charge of an 
army officer; to investigate troubles and to study the relations of the races.. The 
better class of whites were well disposed, but inactive in suppressing any mis- 
conduct of the lower class. Friendliness between the races was general, broken

only by political excitement, and was due, I think, to the fact that they had been - — 
brought up together, often in the most intimate way, from childhood; asurprise — 
to me, for on missionary ground parents, with the spirit of martyrs, take every, — 
pains to prevent contact of their children with the natives around them. 
“Martial law prevailed ; there were no civil courts, and for many months the _ 
bureau officer.in each county acted on all kinds of cases, gaining generally the _ 
confidence of both races. When martial law was over and the rest were 
everywhere discontinued, the military court at Hampten was kept up by com- 
mon consent for about six months, oz 
“‘ Scattered families were reunited. From even Louisiana—for the whole South 
was mapped out, each county officered, and as a rule wisely administered—would 
come inquiries about the relatives and friends of one who had been sold to trad- 
ers years before ; and great justice and humanity were done in bringing together 
broken households. = 
‘Gen. Howard and the Freedmen’s Bureau did for the ex-slavesfrom 1865 to 
1870 a marvelous work, for which due credit has not been given; among other 
things, giving to their education an impulse and a foundation, by granting three 
and a half millions of dollars for schoolhouses, salaries, etc., promoting the edu- 
eation of about a million colored children. The principal negro educational in- 
stitutions of to-day, then starting, were liberally aided at a time of vital need. 
Hampton received over $50,000 through Gen. Howard for building and improve- 
ments. : 
“On relieving my predecessor, Capt. C. B. Wilder, of Boston, at. the Hampton — 
headquarters, I found an active, excellent educational work going on under the 
American Missionary Association of New York, which, in 1862,had opened, in 
the vicinity the first school for freedmen in the South, in charge of an ex-slaye, © 
Mrs. Mary Peake. Over 1,500 children were gathering daily ; some in old hos- 
pital barracks—for here was Camp Hamilton, the base hospital of the Army of 
the James, where, during the war, thousands of sick and wounded soldiers had — 
been cared for,and where now over 6,000 lie buried in a beautiful national cem- 
etery. The largest class was in the Butler School Building, since replaced by 
the fine John G. Whittier Schoolhouse, 
‘“Close at hand, the pioneer settlers of America and the first slaves landed on < — 
this continent; here Powhatan reigned; here the Indian was first met; here 
the first Indian child was baptized; here freedom was first given the slave by 
Gen, Butler’s famous ‘ contraband’ order; in sight of this shore the battle of 
the Monitor and Merrimac saved the Union and revolutionized naval warfare ; 
here Gen. Grant based the operations of his final. campaign. The place was — 
easily accessible by railroad.and water routes to the north, and to a population 
of 2,000,000 of negroes ; the center of prospective great commercial and mari- 
time development—of which Newport News, soon to have the largest and finest - 
shipyard in the world, is beginning the grand fulfilment—and, withal, a place 
most healthful and beautiful for situation. : 
“T soon felt'the fitness of this historic and strategic spot for a permanent and _ 
great educational work. 
“The suggestion was cordially received by the American Missionary Associa- 
tion, which authorized the purchase, in June, 1867, of Little Scotland, an estate of ~ 
125 aeres (since increased to 190),on Hampton River, looking out over Hampton 
Roads. 
‘* Not expecting to have charge, but only to help, I was surprised one day by a 
letter from Secretary E. P. Smith, of the American Missionary Association, 
stating that the man selected for the place had declined, and asking me if I could 
. : take it. I replied, ‘Yes.’ 
“Till then my own future had been blind; it had only been clear that there 
was a work to do for the ex-slaves, and where and how it should be done. 
“The thing to be done was clear; to train selected negro youth who should ~ — 
. go out and teach and lead their people, first by example by getting land and 
homes; to give them not a dollar that they couldearn for themselves; to teach 
respect for labor, to replace stupid drudgery with skilled hands; and to these 
ends, to build up an industrial system for the sake not only of self-support and 
intelligent labor, but also for the sake of character. And itseemed equally clear 
that the people of the country would support a wise work for the freedmen. I 
think so still. 7 5 
“The missionary plan in Hawaii had not, I thought, considered enough the 
real need and weaknesses of the people, whose ignorance alone was not half the 
trouble. The chief difficulty was, wita them, deficient character, as it is with: “e

the negro. He is what his past has made him; the true basis of work for him 
and all men is the scientific one—the facts of heredity and surrounding: all the 
. facts of the case. 
‘There was no enthusiasm for the manual-labor plan. People said, ‘It has 
been tried at Oberlin and elsewhere, and given up; it don’t pay.’ 
‘*©Of course,’ said I, ‘it can not pay in a money way, but it will pay in a moral 
way, especially with the freedmen. It will make them men and women as noth- 
ing else will. It is the only way to make them good Christians.’ 
**The school has had from the first the good fortune of liberal-minded trus- 
tees, who accepted its unformulated, practical plan when it opened, in April, 
1868, with 2 teachers and 15 pupils, and adopted my formal report of 1870, the 
year of its incorporation under a special act of the assembly of Virginia. 
‘* By the act of incorporation the school became independent of any associa- 
tion or sect and of Government. It does work for the State and General Govern- 
ment, for which it receives aid, but is not controlled or supported by them. 
“From the first it has been true to the idea of education by self help, and I 
hope it will remain so. Nothing is asked for the student that he can provide by 
his own labor, but the system that gives him this chance is costly. The school 
depends on charity for $60,000 a year; the student gets nothing but an oppor- 
tunity to work his way. While the workshops must be made to pay as far as 
possible, instruction is as important as production. 
“ Steadily increasing, its full growth, just reached, is 650 boarding students, 
from twenty-four States and Territories, averaging 18 years of age, 136 of them 
Indians; 80 officers, teachers, and assistants, of whom half are in the eighteen 
industrial departments and shops; 300 children in the Whittier (primary) de- 
- partment. 
- The school is maintained at a total annual cost of about $155,000. Deducting 
the labor payments of negro students (say $55,000), $100,000, which is $154 apiece, 
is the net annual cost to the public. This is provided, first, by annual appropri- 
ation from Virginia of $10,000, interest on the State Agricultural College land 
gape (act of Congress, 1862); second, by an appropriation of $20,000 by Congress 
‘or the maintenance of 120 out of our 136 Indians at $167 apiece; third, by an in- 
come of about $10,000 from our endowment fund (of $194,000) and from rents; 
fourth, by about $60,000 contributed by the people, in the form of $70 scholar- 
ships, donations for general purposes and occasional unrestricted legacies. The 
school is never closed, but reduced nearly one-half in the summer; many colored 
students go out to find work, and 60 or more Indian students have ‘ outings’ 
among Massachusetts farmers. 
“A great stimulus to this institute and to all like work has been the 16,000 
negro free schools of the South—nearly 2,000 in Virginia alone—costing the ex- 
slave States nearly $4,000,000 a year in taxation. 
‘Northern charity, at the rate of about $1,000,000 a year, with liberal South- 
ern State aid in some cases, issupplying over twenty strong normal and collegiate 
institutes, mostly under church auspices, where not far from 5,000 adult select 
negro youth of both sexes are being fitted to teach and lead their people—in- 
dustrial education being more and more appreciated and introduced. TheSlater 
fund has been a great stimulus to their technical training. The negro girl has 
proved a great success as a teacher. The women of the race deserve as good a 
chance as the men. 
_ “So far it has been impossible to supply the demand for negro teachers. 
Schcolhouses and salaries, such as they are, are ready; but competent teachers 
are the great and pressing need, and there is no better work for the country 
than to supply them. 
‘But the short public school sessions, of from three to seven months, do not 
give full support, and skilled labor is the only resource of many teachersfor over 
half the year. As farmers and mechanics they are nearly as useful as in the 
schoolroom. Hence the importance of industrial training. 
‘““Hampton’s 720 graduates, discounting 10 per cent as disappointing, with 
half that number of undergraduates, are a working force for negro and Indian 
civilization. To fit them fer this field has cost, since April, 1868, the round sum of 
$1,350,000, not including endowments, of which over $500,000 is represented by 
the school’s ‘plant,’ which is good for generations to come. 
“very year an account of funds received has been rendered in detail. 
‘It was not in the original plan of the school that any but negroes should be 
received, though the liberal State charter made no limit as to color; but when, 
in 1878, a ‘Macedonian cry’ came from some Indian ex-prisoners of war in Flor-

ida—once the worst of savages—through Capt. R. H. Pratt, whose three years’ 
wise management of them in Fort Marion had resulted in a wonderful change, 
seventeen were accepted at private expense, Bishop Whipple providing for five 
of them. The Hon. Carl Schurz, then Secretary of the Interior, was quick to 
appreciate the success of their first few months at Hampton, and sent us more 
Indians from the West; then Congress, on the strength of the results at Hamp- 
ton, and of Capt. Pratt’s proved capacity, appropriated funds to start the great 
work at Carlisle, where over five hundred Indian youth, under Capt. Pratt, are 
being taught the ‘white man’s way.’ 
“The annual Indian attendance at Hampton is now 136, of whom 120are aided 
by Government, the rest by charity. The death rate, once alarming, has, for 
six years, been not quite one a year. Of the 345 returned Indians, but 25 are 
reported as unsatisfactory, but 4 of them bad; the rest are employed asfarmers, 
catechists, preachers, teachers, mechanics, clerks, etc.; 35 secking further edu- 
cation, 6 of them in Eastern normal schools and colleges, and 42 of the girls are 
married, in good homes, 
“The old homesickness of Indians at eastern schools is nearly over. The 
three years’ period at school, which was formerly too much like a prison term, 
is more and more ignored, and the idea of fitting for life, whatever time it takes, 
gains strength. Indians areno longer coaxed tocome. Twice as many as we 
can take wish to come; yet the really desirable ones are not very many, and we 
do not care to increase our numbers. Our Indian work is illustrative rather 
than exhaustive. 
“Tn the twenty classes—of 1871 to 1890, inclusive—723 graduates have received diplomas, 280 young women and 443 young men. Of these, 25 are Indians—8 _ 
young women and 17 young men—the first Indians graduating in 1882. 
“ Of the 723 graduates, 604 report as teachers; 80, a trifle over 11 per cent, 
report failure to teach. Of these 80, 9 are Indians, which brings down the per 
cent of colored graduates failing to teach to almost exactly 10\per cent. That 
16 out of the 25 Indian graduates have taught is a very good showing for them, 
considering the fewer opportunities to teach which have been open to them. 
Of 39 graduates (colored) we have bzen unable to obtain any report. 
‘The total number of those who report having other regular occupation than 
teaching is 271. Of these, 191 have taught as well. While the balance—413— 
do not report other regular occupation than teaching, the great majority find 
employment as they can—at farming, trades, or service—between school terms, 
or cultivate their own land and keep house. . 
“The principal regular occupations reported besides teaching and the num- ; 
ber reporting in each are as follows:

‘‘Some light on the frequent question as to the comparative mental endow-

the unforeseen and rather striking result of an investigation of the distribution 
of the highest class honors since 1874, when they were first awarded.

    CHAPTER XIV. 
TOE SWEDISH OR LING GYMNASTICS. 
By G. B. Putnam, Principal of Franklin School, Boston, Mass. 
The third wave of popular interest in physical culture has been rising rapidly 
of late in this country, and it is to be hoped that it may reach and effect for good 
all,our public schools. 
It is said: ‘““We grant that gymnastics should be introduced at once, but what 
system shall be employed?” There is no American system. “This is confirmed 
by Dr, Edward Hitchcock, of Amherst College, who says: ‘‘I have been work- 
ing at physical culture for a quarter of a century. I do not, however, think 
that we have a system,” and by Prof. E. M. Hartwell, of Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, who says: ‘‘It is not calling a thing by a name that makes a system, and 
that is the point I wish to urge in regard to the so-called American system. We — 
have none.” 
The Germans have a system developed by “Father Jahn,” who from love of _ 
Fatherland introduced turning throughout Germany, producing wonderful re- 
sults among its youth in the early part of the present century. 
His system was imported into this country, es early as 1826, by Dr. Charles 
Beck, at the Round Hill School, Northampton; by Dr. Follen, at Harvard Uni- 
versity, and by Dr. Francis Lieber, at the Gymnasium in Boston. These were 
able, enthusiastic men and good teachers. All three were pupils of the illus- 
trious Jahn, who said of the latter that he ‘‘ possessed good moral behavior, was 
ingenious and clever, as well as a good leader and teacher of gymnastics,” and 
yet their efforts failed of lasting success. 
Many of the good features of Jahn’s system have been appropriated by numer- 
ous teachers in our higher schools and colleges, as well as by those in charge _ 
of our city gymnasia. They have introduced them at random, with others from 
England, France, or Sweden, or among devices of their own invention, in order 
to establish a so-called American system. Some good results have followed, but 
there remains a crying demand for a system which is adapted to the felt neces- - 
sities of public schools from primary to high-school grades. ! 
Iam persuaded that the Ling system of Sweden, as it stands to-day, is just 
what we need. 
It‘has stood the test of seventy or eighty years, and its effects have long been ~ 
visible. 
A correspondent of the New York Tribune, traveling in Sweden thirty years 
ago, wrote as follows: ‘‘I attribute the superior physique of the inhabitants of — 
this country, in a great measure, to the gymnastic exercises which they receive 
in the public schools. This kind of training is universal. Every school build- 
ing has its large high room with earthen or matted floor, with all sorts of gym- 
nastic implements. The scholars are not allowed to exercise on what they 
wish, but there is a regular scientifically arranged system. They are trained in 
squads and move and march at the word of command. ' The smaller or weaker. 
boys begin with the lowest grade of exercises and follow up according to a scien- 
tific system arranged to promote health. They all seem to go into it with the 
greatest relish and show well-trained muscular power.” 
A lady from Fialand recently remarked that at her home they could always 
distinguish a lady from Sweden, for she walked a queen. Thirty years ago 
John D, Philbrick, the sagacious superintendent of Boston schools, saw clearly 
the needs of the pupils in the way of physical culture, and in his report of Sep- 
tember, 1860, dwelt at length on these needs, and made suggestions for meeting 
them, saying, among other things, “The principal remedy I would suggest is 
1103
-P-A-G-E-512
     
1104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889+90. 
the introduction into all grades of schools of a thorough system of physical training 
as a part of school culture, in which every pupil shall be required to participate. 
I fully agree with an able author, that a universal course of training of this 
kind, scientifically arranged and applied, in connection with obedience to othdr 
laws of health, might, in one generation, transform the inhabitants of this land 
from the low development now so extensive to the beautiful model of the high- 
est form of humanity.” 
The report was referred to a subcommittee of five of the ablest men in the 
school board, and they, largely through his influence, recommended the appoint- 
ment of a competent teacher and the daily practice of gymnastics, and they say, 
after speaking of the injurious effects of certain violent exercises: ‘‘Thesystem 
invented by Prof. Ling, of Sweden, which is called free gymnastics, is not liable 
to this objection. It consists of a variety of motions of the head, chest, trunk, 
and limbs, performed with energy and vigor, without the use of fixed apparatus. 
Indeed, mést of the exercises, and perhaps sufficientfor the purpose of our public 
schools, require no apparatus whatever, and no special room set apart for its 
practice. This system, in a modified form, it is deemed both desirable and 
practicable to introduce into all our schools, and it is recommended that it be 
made an obligatory branch of education.” 
But the school board was not then ready to follow the advice of their subcom- 
mittee, and a golden opportunity was lost. 
Nearly thirty years have passed and Mrs. Mary Hemenway, who, in the estab- 
lishment of cooking schools and the introduction of sewing, has been a real 
benefactor to the children of Boston, has turned her attention to the introduc- 
tion of a system of physical culture that she may thereby benefit the schools of 
the city. 
In the autumn of 1888 she secured a hall and employed as instructor a grad- 
uate of the Royal Central Gymnastic Institute of Sweden, which Prof. Hartwell 
pronounces the best school for training teachers of gymnastics in the world. 
Classes were formed from among the teachers of the public schools, and they 
entered earnestly upon the task of fitting themselves to teach the Ling system. 
The first public exhibition of it was given by a dozen ladies of the normal 
class at the conference on physicial training, in Huntington Hall, Boston, in 
November, 1889. Again its peculiar features were exhibited at Mechanics’ Hall 
before some four thousand people on the afternoon of April 5, 1890, by a normal 
class and also by pupils of the first and fifth classes of the Franklin Grammar 
School. This exhibition was under the auspices of the American Association 
for the Advancement of Physical Education, which was holding its annual meet- 
ing in the city. 
* But who was Ling?” I am often asked. Peter Henrik Ling was born in 
Ljunga, province of Smaland, Sweden, November 15, 1776. 
His father was a clergyman, but young Peter was soon left an orphan, and in 
early manhood, prompted by a love of adventure, traveled over EKurope. His 
journeys were apparently aimless and he was often reduced to extreme want. 
He succeeded, however, in mastering several modern languages and finally 
returned to Sweden. 
Soon after, while suffering from an attack of the gout in the elbow, he thought 
to cure it by exercise, and to this end he learned the art of fencing. 
The remedy proved effective, and his success led to the idea that other dis- 
eases might yield to proper exercise. Hence the origin of the Swedish move- 
ment cure, as the author of which his fame has become world wide. It has been 
practiced not only in the leading countries of Europe, but in the United States 
as well. That he might be able the better to apply his theories he became pro- 
ficient in anatomy and physiology, and not content with healing the sick he de- 
voted himself to inventing and arranging a system of exercises adapted to the 
harmonious development of the bodies of children and also the physical perfec- 
tion of those destined to the life of a soldier. 
In 1805 he became professor of fencing in the university at Lund and later was 
appointed master of fencing in the Military Academy at Cartzerg. 
* In 1813 the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics was established at Stock- 
holm for the purpose of extending the application of his theories, and he became 
its director. Here he remained until his death, which occurred in 1839. 
He received the rare honor of being made a member of the Swedish Academy, 
and the king conferred upon him the title of Knight of the Order of the North 
Star. The work which he laid down has been perfected by his pupils and suc- 
cessors, and, during these many years, patients have flocked thither for healing, 
and students for normal training in the three departments of gymastics.

    THE SWEDISH OR LING GYMNASTICS. 1105 
Again, it is asked, ‘‘ What is the Swedish system?” Let us first asic, “What 
isits aim?” It is based on the following proposition: ‘‘The object of educa-— 
tional gymnastics is to train the pupil to make his body subservient to his own 
will.” This can only be accomplished by practice, regular and systematic. If 
the proper practice is secured, then activity, dexterity, strength, and health 
are quite sure to follow. 
The Ling system has three departments, medical, military, and educational, 
and of the latter only do I write. 
The exercises are classified as follows: 
1. Introductions, or orders to gain attention and good position. 
*2, Arch flexions, or movements for the back and chest. 
3. Heaving movements, or exercises in lifting the body by the arms or in ex- 
tending them. 
4. Balance movements, to give a correct carriage and general equilibrium. 
5, Shoulder-blade movements, to flatten the back and pull the shoulders back- 
ward in their proper place. 
6. Abdominal exercises, to strengthen the muscles of the abdomen and to aid 
digestion. 
7. Luteral trunk movements, to strengthen the lateral parts of the trunk, 
8. Slow leg movements, to increase the circulation in the lower limbs, to quiet 
the action of the heart, and to counteract palpitation. 
9. Jumping and vaulting, to cultivate speed of motion and to effect the codrdi- 
nation of movements. 
10. Respiratory movements, to increase the capacity of the lungs, to restore 
breathing to its normal rhythm, and,to help counteract the evil effects of pre- 
cipitate movements. 
In each of these classes there may be scores, if not hundreds, of exercises of 
varying strength. From these a selection is made for a ‘‘day’s order” or pro- ~ 
gramme for the day. This provides exercise for the whole body., Nerves, - 
muscles, and internal organs, as well as the blood vessels, have all received due 
attention. 
Teachers do noteusually take the exercises in their exact order, but make such 
selections as the special needs of particular classes seem to require. 
Suitable exercises are available from these classes for years of work in free 
gymnastics, but as pupils become more advanced fixed apparatus may be desired 
even in our schools, and no objection would be made toa well-equipped gymna- 
sium in connection with each, but this is not essential. 
One of the features of special value in this system is that a ‘‘fundamental po- 
sition” is first assumed, and whatever may be the subsequent positions taken or — 
movements executed there is an immediate return to this. Hence there is con- 
stant practice in taking and holding that position which presents the best pose 
and carriage that can be secured. 
Another marked feature is its progression. It begins with the simplest moyve- 
ments which could not harm an invalid or the feeblest pupil, and by years of 
practice it leads on gradually, by movements stronger and stronger and of longer 
duration, to feats before which an athlete might stand appalled. Of course these 
would never find a place in the school room. 
As has been shown, each ‘‘ Day’s Order” has its progression also. One car- 
dinal principle is that not every possible motion or position is of value or to be 
permitted. Only such are selected as are adapted to accomplish some specific 
end. That end is clearly seen and its attainment provided for. No exercise is 
performed simply because it is ‘‘ pretty.” 
Another is that movements are made in response to words of command, no 
music being employed. Ling’s belief was that‘ there is a rhythm of movement 
as well as of music, but there is an essential difference between them, and often 
no adjustment is possible. The rhythm of the movement must be sacrificed to 
that of the music if the latter is introduced, and for a large part of the move- 
ments music is an impossibility, since no musician could ever adapt it to them. 
The use of words of command is to me one of the marked excellencies of this 
system, for if there is any one thing which our American children need it is the 
habit of obedience, and obedience so prompt that they are hardly aware that they 
are obeying. 
Ihave read of a stalwart band of rebellious slaves, who once attacked their 
master, who was sick, alone,and unarmed. In tones of command he exclaimed: 
‘Lay down your arms, you rascals, goinstantly to your work or I will have every 
one of you flogged within aninch of his life.” He was completely in their power, 
and yet, so confirmed was their habit of prompt obedience, that, to a man, they 
threw down their arms and fled from his presence.

Our pupils are not our slaves, butit is for their good and ours that they render 
instant and cheerful obedience. 
The habit early formed in their physical exercises will have its effect all alogg 
the line of school work. 
A former major of a school battalion, recently informed me that he considered 
this habit of prompt obedience the best part of the military drill in which he 
had had so conspicuous a part. Because ‘‘ dictation is contrary to the American 
spirit,” isan argument in favor of ‘‘commands” rather than a valid objection 
against them. 
_ In my student days musele was the end and aim, and a powerful biceps flexor 
_ was the pride of its possessor and the envy of all who failed tosecure it. Not so 
in the Swedish system. The nerves, respiratory organs, etc., receive even more 
consideration. The aim is not to acquire the strength of a giant, but that sym- 
metry of proportion and harmony of development which shall best fit for a life 
work. 
A distinguished physician recently said, ‘‘ Show me one who has be2n an ath- 
dete, who is now more than 42 years old, and I will show you aprematurely old 
man.” There is some justice in the remark, for of those of my associates’ who 
were excessively trained for the development of muscle not one is alive to day. 
. From the Swedish system no such results need be expected. 
To the best of my knowledge, the teachers, both male and female, who. have 
received drill in this system are unanimous in praise of it, both for its good ef 
fects upon them, personally, and for its adaptability to the needs of the schcols. 
Ata recent meeting of the masters, where for the third evening this subject 
had been under consideration, Mr. Watgrhouse, head master of the English 
highschool, said that in his opinion a system of exercises for our public schools 
should “be,-1, simple; 2, light; 3, safe; 4, comprehensive; 5, progressive; 6, 
varied; 7, lively, and that, after a careful investigation, he was satisfied that 
the Ling system furnished all of these requisites, and was therefore what should 
‘tbe introduced. That the system will soon be authorized bythe school com- 
mittee of Boston I have no doubt. 
Several cities in the vicinity have already adopted it. 
ADDENDUM, 
(Extracts from the report of the director. of physical training in the Boston, Mass., public 
schools (Dr. E. M. Hartwell), December, 1891.] . 
Boston has earned the right to be considered the most influential center in 
America of the movement for promoting Swedish educational gymnastics. This 
result, which has been brought about within the last three years, is primarily 
due to the wisdom, generosity, and public spirit of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, and 
secondarily to the discussions, reports, and votes of your honorable board prece- 
dent to its adoption of the Ling gymnastics for the public schcols on June 24, 
1890. The establishment by Mrs. Hemenway of the Boston Normal Schocl of 
Gymnastics, which already has no equals and few rivals in the country as regards 
- the genuine and thoroughgoing character of its training, is an event of capital 
importance in the history of physical training in America, and may well be 
' ranked beside the gift to Harvard University of the Hemenway gymnasium, by 
Mr. Augustus Hemenway, her son. 
The Boston Normal Schooi of Gymnastics had its beginning in October, 1888, 
when, at Mrs. Hemenway’s invitation, a woman's class, composed of twenty-five 
public-school teachers, was formed for the purpose of testing, under the instruc- 
tion of a trained Swede, the adaptability of the Ling gymnastics to use in the 
Boston schools. ‘The experiment proved so satisfactory that on April 25, 1889, 
Mrs. Hemenway offered to provide similar instruction for one year, without ex- 
pense to the city, for one hundred teachers of the public schoo!s who should be 
_ permitted to use the Ling gymnastics in their several schools. June 25 the 
school board voted to accept this offer, and in the ensuing September the class 
was formed. On September, 1889, the board accepted ‘‘ with grateful appreca- 
‘tion the generous offer of Mrs. Mary Hemenway to provide a teacher of the 
‘Ling system of gymnastics, for service in the normal school, free of expense to 
the city.” Mrs. Hemenway’s further offer to provide fre2 instruction ‘‘for those 
masters and submasters who may des-re to make a thorough study of the Ling 
system for the benefit of the Boston public schools,” was accepted by the board

on October 22. Mrs. Hemenway continued to maintain the ‘‘ masters’ class” and 
to provide the normal school with a special teacher of Ling gymnastics through- 
ut the school year 1890-91. The ‘‘ masters’ class” numbered 50 in 1889-90 and 
57 in 1890-91. In 1889-90 there were 190 women engaged in teaching in the pub- 
~ lie schools who received instruction in the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics, 
In 1890-91 the number was 140. Its first class of graduates, numbering 33, was 
graduated June 6, 1891. The demand for the services of graduates and pupils. of 
this school, as special teachers of Ling gymnastics, greatly exceeds the supply. 
October 8, 1889, the committee on hygiene, which had been given full powers 
in the department of physical exercises (on March 12), presented a well-consid- 
ered ‘‘report of the board of supervisors on physical training in the public 
schools.” (Scheol Doc. No. 10, 1889.) The concluding recommendations of the 
supervisors were as follows: 
“1, That the Ling system of gymnastics be the authorized system of physical 
training in the public schools and that it be introduced into them as scon as 
teachers are prepared to conduct the exercises. 
“2. That a competent teacher of this system be employed to train the pupils 
in the normal school and the teachers in the public schools. 
‘<3. That for the coming year provision be made for training at least the pu- 
pils in the normal school, and the teachers of the first and second classes of the 
primary schools, and the fifth and sixth classes of the grammar schools.” 
These recommendations were approved by the majority of the committee on 
- hygiene and a minority report was made by Miss Hastings. Both reports were 
tabled. December 10, ‘the whole subject of physical training in the public 
schools was referred to the next school board.” 
Meanwhile on November 29 and 30, 1889, Boston was the scene of thedargest 
and most notable conference’on physical training ever held in the United States. 
Dr. W. T. Harris, the United States Commissioner of Education, presided over 
its deliberations. The call for it was signed by John W. Dickinson, secretary 
of the Massachusetts board of education; E. P. Seaver, superintendent.of the 
Boston public schools; Francis A. Walker, president of the Massachusetts In- 
stitute of Technology; and by the presidents of Boston University, Colby Uni- 
versity, Maine, and Wellesley College, aswell as by many members of the Bos‘on 
school committee and a large number of physicians and others prominent in 
educational circles. The audience at each of the four sessions of the conference 
numbered from fifteen hundred to two thousand persons. * * * 
The programme, which embraced papers, discussions, and illustrative class 
exercises in gymnastics, was a varied and interesting one, and served not only 
to set forth the general nature and effects of muscular exercise, but also the 
salient principles and characteristic methods of the German and Swedish and 
so-called ‘‘American” Systems of school gymnastics. Similar discussions and 
illustrative gymnastics on a large scale signalized the fifth annual meeting of 
the A. A. A. P. E., held in Boston in April, 1890. The public and educational 
mind was much awakened and not a little enlightened by reason of so much dis- 
cussion and exposition. 
January 16, 1890, a standing committee on physical training was appointed. 
Dr. W. A. Mowry, its chairman, made an exhaustive report on June 24, em- 
bodying the results of a wide tour in the West and South to observe the peculi- 
arities and workings of various systems of physical training in public schools. ~ 
The committee, without a dissenting vote, recommended the following: 
Ordered, That the-Ling or Swedish system of educational gymnastics be in- 
troduced into all the public schools of this city. 
Ordered, That the appointment of one director of physical training and four 
assistants be authorized. ! 
Ordered, That the salary of the director of physical training be $2,640 a year 
and that the salary of each assistant be $1,080 a year. : 
The following order was substituted for the second and third orders appended 
to the report: 
Ordered, That a director of physical training and one or more assistants be 
employed, the total salaries for the same not to exceed the sum of five thousand 
dollars ($5,000) per annum and that the committee on physical training be 
authorized to nominate suitable persons for these positions, to commence ut the 
beginning of the next school term. 2 
    In accordance with the above orders, the present director of physical training a 
was elected on Novémber 25, 1890, at a salary of $3,000 per annum, and the pres- 
ent assistant instructor was elected March 10, 1891, at a salary of $1,680. * * * 
I re%ntered the service of the city of Boston on January 1, 1891, after aminter-

val of 133 years, and at once began visiting schools of all grades, from the kin- 
dergarten to the high school, having a twofold purpose in view. In the first 
place, I was desirous to familiarize myself with the main features of the organi- 
zation and administration of the schools and, secondly, [ wished to obiain an 
idea of the character and extent of the physical training which had been intro- 
duced into the schools, in accordance with the vote of the school committee, on 
June 24, 1890. 
~ Toward the end of February I addressed a circular letter to the principals of 
schcols, in response to which I received a statistical return, covering the month 
of January, 1891, regarding all high, grammar, and primary schools. 
The returns showed that upwards of 1,100 teachers were giving gymnastic in- 
struction, for some 17 minutes daily, to their classes. In some schoois the old 
memorized gymnastic drill had been continued, pending the appointment of a 
. director of physical training ; but the greater number of teachers, in the gram- 
may and primary schools, were engaged in an honest attempt to teach the Ling 
free standing movements. Counting the masters of the 55 grammar schools, 
1,120 teachers, in the grammar districts, were returned as teaching gymnastics, 
of which number, below the grade of master, 844 were teaching Ling gymnastics 
and 221 teaching what may be termed not inaptly ‘‘mixed gymnastics.” The 
best results were observed in those schools whose masters had attended the 
t-achers’ classes of the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics and had taken par- 
ticular pains, besides, to lead, assist, and criticise their teachers in the work of 
class instruction in gymnastics. In certain schools extremely creditable results 
had been attained, especially in those where the teachers had formed themselves 
into classes and hired special instructors in the Ling system to give them nor- 
~ mal lessons. 
It gives me pleasure to say that I have been much surprised and gratified 
by the interest, zeal, and intelligence shown by the teachers of the grammar 
and primary schools, as a body, in the subject of physical training. 
Since April 1,1891,1 have availed myself of the invaluable services of Mr. 
Hartvig Nissen, who wa’ elected assitant instructor in physical training, March 
10,1891. Mr. Nissen has assisted me in visiting and inspecting schools and has 
conducted normal classes in the Ling gymnastics for the teachers of the gram- 
mar and primary schools. Two inspections of the grammar schools have been 
made since they opened on September 9. On the basis afforded by the first in- 
spection, 8 were rated ‘‘excellent,” 18 ‘‘ good,” 17 ‘‘passable,” and 12 ‘‘ poor.” 
The result of the second inspection is as follows: 8 were marked ‘‘ excellent,” 20 
“good,” 20 passable,” and 7 ‘‘ poor.” 
I propose to continue such classes until the class work in the schools shall show 
that the average teacher has grasped the main principles of the Ling school 
gymnastics and is able to carry them into effect. 
Early in 1890 I was engaged by Mrs. Mary Hemenway to deliver a course of 
lectures on physical training before the students of the Boston Normat School 
of Gymnastics. These lectures were given in the Oid South Meeting-House, at 
noon, on six Saturdays, viz, March 21 and 28, April 18 and 25, and.May 2 and 
9. Through the kindness of Mrs. Hemenway the lectures in question were 
thrown open to all teachers of the Boston public schools. I was thus enabled to 
meet so many of the teachers as cared to consider the salient facts regarding 
_the origin, development, and characteristic features of the principal types and 
systems of physical training. 
Lalso addressed the masters of the grammar schools upon ‘‘ Physical training 
‘in the Boston schools” at the May meeting of the Masters’ Association. 
In accordance with an order of the school committee, which was passed May 
12, Mr. Nissen gave special normal instruction to the teachers of the primary 
- and grammar schools of some forty districts during May and June. This form 
of instruction has been continued, though in a less formal way in all grammar 
districts, from the opening of the schools in September last until now. In ac- 
cordance with an order passed by the school committee on December 8, arrange- 
ments have been made to provide for the normal instruction, twice a month, in 
the Ling free standing movements, of all teachers of the primary and grammar 
schcols, not especially excused by the committee on physical training, during 
the remainder of the present school year.

The truer meaning of patriotism.—Hon. William A. Poste, New York civil-serv- 
ice commissioner: Patriotism, as an impulse, like all the enthusiasms; counts 
for nothing in the every-day life unless its deep and truer meaning is fully per- 
ceived. The ideal of citizenship can not rise higher than the moral nature. 
The flag may wave from every school-house, and the boy may know on how 
many battle fields it led the way to glory, but unless behind all is the thought 
that a man is as much bounden to his country to vote thoughtfully as to fight 
for the flag if the country ¢éalls, that flag to him is indeed but striped bunting. 
Unless he can understand that for a man to sell his vote * * * is moral 
treason, what boots it to him that in every age men have gone to their deaths 
for truth, for fatherland, and that their babes might breathe free air. 
Beliefs that are individual. and inherent.—Hon. William A. Poste: The beliefs 
that men live by and die for are not to be drilled into the boy like the rule for ~- 
long division. The genesis and growth and persistence of political opinions are 
often beyond analysis and, to the theorist, unscientific, illogical. It,is well that 
this isso. These convictions are matters very largely of personal dispositions, 
intangible but persistent as the traits of race. If they are individual and in- 
herent, they are of more positive personal force throughout the multitude than 
any dogma nurtured in the schools. Let the boy come to his political faith as 
Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln came to the princi- 
ples that made and saved the State. It is outof the clashing of such individual- 
isms, spear against shield, that the will of the people works. Its voice is heard 
above them. The voice is not always the voice of God, but in times of trial, in 
hours when great and solemn questions are asked and answered, the thunder of 
Sinai is in it. s 
“Patriots’ Day” proposed.—Superintendent J. R. Preston, Mississippi: One 
school day should be set apart every year as Patriots’ Day. Planting trees and 
flowers to adorn school premises—an engaging practice now in vogue in most of 
the States—is undoubtedly a potent means of establishing attractive associa- re 
tions and of endearing the school, and through it the State, to the hearts of ~ : 
future citizens. If this be a laudable practice, how much more worthy and sig- 
nificant to utilize a day to implant in their natures the seeds of genuine patriot-- ieee 
ism. Just as ground is prepared to nourish tree and flower, so may hearts and “a 
intellects be quickened to cherish high resolve. 2 
So let us have Patriots’ Day dedicated as a national holiday, on which to 
focalize the light and grandeur of our country and photograph its glory upon 
the hearts of the children. Let parents and the community at large congregate 
at the school, and in song and recitation and patriotic speeches revive their love 
of country and deepen their spirit of fidelity to its principles.       1109 ae

‘1110 _. EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The highest patriotism.—W. D. Atkinson: True patriotism is the endeavor to — 
elevate my country’s standard of honor up to that which is right and true, and 
Ishould love my country for that in her which is devoted to righteousness. I 
should:love the truth and righteousness which God has given us, and seek to 
bring my country up to it. Iam not to make patriotism, therefore, the end, 
put rather the means by which I may hope to bring the nation to a love of right- 
eousness. Ido not think the observance of any patriots’ day will ever attain 
that result. The time wasted or spent in that could be better spent in educating 
the young men in these moral truths and principles which will make the citi- 
zens seek that which will be for his country’s highest good; hence it is not 
patriotism itself we are striving to attain, but it is love of truth, of right, and 
righteousness. Patriotism is nothing more than this; that is the highest 
patriotism. 
A great difference.—Principal George M. Grant, Queen’s University (Ontario): 
‘The school should teach patriotism, and let us not forget that there is as great 
a difference between patriotism and the blatant, arrogant spread-eagleism— 
which in Europe is called Chauvinism—as there is between enthusiasm and 
fanaticism. The one is healthy and full of generous inspirations and the other 
unhealthy and the destroyer of true patriotism and morality. The one teaches 
us to love our own land and race first, because it is ours, and we believe that it 
has done and that it promises to do most for man and for that which is best in 
man, especially for the good old cause of liberty, peace, and righteousness. 
The other teaches us to hate men for the love of God or the love of country. 
II.—CoMPuLsoRY ATTENDANCE. 
Compulsory education in Ontario.—Hon. George W. Ross, minister of education: 
_By an act of last session the police commissioners of every city, town, and in- 
corporated village are required to appoint truant officers. This act came into 
effect on the 1st of this month [July, 1891]. It may take a year or two to ac- 
quaint the people of the province with its requirements. It may also takesome 
time to train the truant officers to the proper discharge of their duties. Asthe 
schools of Ontario have been free for over twenty years, there is no doubt the 
_ people will gladly accept their natural complement, compulsory education, as 
indispensable. 
The most effective agency for securing school attendance.—Report of Committee of 
National Council of Education, D. L. Kiehle, chairman: Everyone, and very cer- 
tainly every educator, will place the first stress upon the natural, self-command- 
ing, and assimilating power of a public free-school system, and will agree that 
this should be perfected to meet every demand of the highest standard of phys- 
ical, intellectual, and moral training; that it should be protected from every 
corrupting influence and every political or religious entanglement, and that its 
true value by every means should be impressed upon the public mind. 
Next, as to the necessity and practicability of applying the compulsory feature 
for the general enforcement of attendance, there will be various cpinions, ac- 
cording to points and circumstances of observation. 
In some large cities; and especially in manufacturing districts where children 
are at the mercy of soulless corporations, the State has successfully enforced a 
compulsory law; but in the State at large, and especially in agricultural districts, 
your committee are not aware of any enforcement of a compulsory law, which 
proves that it can be made an effective part of our educational system. 
Our system ought to be extended by educational methods.—Superintendent D. L- 
Kiehle (Minnesota): The Government ought to look to the limitation and im- 
provement of its citizenship,*and we as educators oughtto put more stress upon’ 
the improvement and extension of our educational system by educational methods. 
Our system ought to be perfected. We ought to domore for our young people 
We ought to make our system less objectionable. We ought to introduce 
moral element as perfectly as possible, to meet the demands of that cle 
people who have been accustomed to associate religious instruction with ¢ 
instruction. Now, coming to the legislative part, theoretically your ec” 
has no doubt thatit is perfectly legitimate thatmen be required to do th- 
but practically it questions whether it is not better to enforce tb 
law in our towns and cities moderately, watching the develop” 
stances, and not relying on the law to effect very much at pr 
tural districts or over the country at large, but ai all times holt 
ordinate feature of our educational system. 
i 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
    The labor unions approve it.—Hon. B. G. Northrop (Clinton, Conn.): It is a sig- 
nificant fact that the labor unions in this country and in Europe approve obliga- 
tory education. Both political parties favor it. So far as T know, no suggestion 
for the repeal of our:rigid law has been made in the legislature, nor in any cau- 
cus or. public meeting in the State (Connecticut). 
IIl.—Courses or StuDy—ADJUSTMENT oF SCHOOL PROGRAMMES. 
On the necessity of colleges to.supplement high schools —W.'T. Harris (from-an ad- 
dress delivered before the Ohio Teachers’ Association, June, 1888): The course 
of iedy prepeatory, for college omits for the most part those branches of study 
which 
great increments and added them to the inherited wisdom of the race, These in- 
crements are modern natural science, modern literature, modern history. These 
three moderns had no well-recognized existence in schools of higher education 
acentury ago. A knowledge of them was not demanded or expected from the 
educated man, unless he was a specialist. The condition of things has changed 
so materially through the influence of the newspaper and periodical within the 
past fifty years that no man can pass for educated without more or less minute 
acqua‘ntance with these three phases of modern activity. They have become rec- 
ognized as conventionalities of intelligence. This is the all-sufficient reason for 
introducing the rudiments of these things into the most elementary schools and 
for continuing their study in all grades of higher schools, Nothing can mak 
up for the student, who shall receive a higher education, the deficit in his cul- 
ture caused by a neglect of the study of the three ‘‘moderns” in early life. They “> COURSES OF STUDY. —~ “1111 
2ar the name of *‘ moderns.” Modern civilization has developed three ~ 
ought to exist in his mind through the period of his primary education as well as — 
in his secondary and higher education. Witheut these the disciplinary effect 
of classical study must necessarily be weakened through the want of modern 
facts to explain, for the classic lore is related to these moderns as embryonic 
presupposition, and this is why it helps to understand ourselves. as 
If this be true, the modifications that have been made in the course of study 
pursued in college in recent times (say in the last twenty years) are not for the 
most part based upon a correct insight into the difficulty to be met. The man- 
agement of college education in this country has answered the ob:ection which 
charges it with neglect of the three ‘‘ modern” branches until the last two years 
of the college course, by raising the standard of admission sufficiently to cover 
the work of the first two years of the former college course, and thereupon it 
exhibits a programme in which-the three moderns are represented throvghout 
the course either as ‘‘ required” or ‘‘elective” studies. 
The question in dispute did not concern the length of time devoted to higher 
education, but the early introduction of the moderns into the course of study, 
so that these moderns stand side by side with the disciplinary studies through 
the whole course. If four years of preparation and two years of college work, 
or six years in all, were devoted to the exclusive study of the classics and math- 
ematics, with an almost entire neglect of moderns, the case would not be al- 
tered if these six years should be relegated entirely to the preparatory school. 
In order to meet the difficulty discussed here, the college should have changed 
the conditions required for admission, and thus have compelled the prepara- 
tory school to introduce the moderns in a proper manner side by side with the 
classical studies. Of course the elevation of the standard of the collage can be 
justified on its own grounds. It obliterates the mischievous distinction that ex- 
isted between the standards of American and English colleges. But this is not 
so important as the readjustment demanded of the college in order to bring it 
into harmony with primary education, founded on a true appreciation of the 
demand of modern studies in education. As is usual in the discussion of politi- 
cal and social reforms, the parties to the dispute are busied, each, with bringing 
forward his own partisan view of the case. There is little that is judicial and 
impartial, going to the root of the question and confirming and establishing 
what is of permanent worth on either side. The advocates of the ‘‘moderns” 
wish to dispense entirely with classical study while the defenders of the college 
system refuse to yield place for the ‘‘moderns.” 
In the colleges of the Northwestern States, led by the State universities, there 
has been some substantial progress made towards a modification that will rec- 
ognize the received high-school course of study asa preparation. But such 
modification only makes these colleges a separate phase of education, differing 
more and more widely from the standard college of the Atlantic States. To 
reach the high standard of admission required by the Eastern colleges the

public high school ought to add two years to its course. This would make the 
course of study in the common-school system fourteen years instead of twelve, 
as at present, and is impracticable. The average age of the high-school grad; 
uate at present being eighteen and a half years, it would manifestly be unwise 
to demand six years instead of four years to complete his college course. The 
colleges that have raised their standards. of admission, therefore, haye done 
much to widen the breach between high-school and college education. 
In the signs of the times Ido not discover any promise of the reform of this 
state of things on the part of the managementof colleges. Even the cloud ‘‘no 
bigger than a man’s hand” in the Northwest does not indicate so much true 
appreciation of the necessity of moderns in primary and secondary education as 
it indicates a wise insight into the desirability of connecting the college with 
» the public school as itis. It surrenders its convictions in behalf of the old 
_ régime, and lowers its standard in order to adapt itself to unpropitious cireum- 
stances. In better times it hopes a reform in the public school that will devote 
more attention to the classics and mathematics at the expense of the ‘‘ mod- 
erns.” Meanwhile, the influence of the college is felt in the building up of pre- 
paratory courses within the high school, fastening upon the public-school system 
a recognition of the necessity of private, separate, and distinct secondary edu- 
cation in order to fit for a college education. 
What is the remedy ?. 
One must turn to the teachers of public high schools and to superintendents 
of public instruction for the adoption of the only means of relief. Unusual ef- 
. forts must be made on the part of public high schools to induce their pupils’ to 
complete their education in colleges. The personal influence of the teachers, 
in one:year’s time, will avail to double the number of high-school graduates who 
seek a college training. The greater maturity of mind which comes froma 
well-balanced preparatory course will furnish a prevailing argument in favor of 
a more symmetrical system. Within a few years, when the colleges have come 
to-derive a large majority of their pupils from public high schools, this ques- 
tion will receive its due consideration for reasons of private interest, if for no 
other. The numerical strength of high-school graduates who have subsequently 
received a college education will assist in the solution of this question. 
But no solution will be more than a makeshift if it does not secure the rec- 
ognition of ‘‘ moderns” as an essential portion of the course of study in all ele- 
mentary and preparatory schools and a like recognition of the necessity of 
classic study in all secondary and higher education. 
In the ‘‘ moderns” one finds the expression of his present civilization; in the 
classics, its embryonic forms and evolution. 
After the presentation of these special discussions of the elements of our prob- 
lem we may draw the following conclusions: * 
1. If the universities and colleges of the country shall more and more depend 
on special preparatory schools for their students, then it will follow that college 
graduates are less likely to be in sympathy with the system of common schools. 
2. If the high-school teachers, on the other hand, continue to be lukewarm 
toward college education, and perhaps go so far as to diséourage their pupils 
from completing their education in colleges after graduating from the high 
school, it will follow that the men of amplést directive power, the leaders in 
literature and the molders of public opinion, especially’on the subject of educa- 
tion, will not be furnished by the common-school system. 
Tt will follow, too, that the numbers who resort to college will not increase in 
proportion to our population. These dangers, in brief, I hold in this paper, may 
be averted by earnest personal endeavor on the part of high-school teachers and 
the superintendents of city schools to influence high-school pupils to present 
themselves in large numbers for admission to college. Extra efforts will double 
and treble the high-school quota in college, even under the present disadvan- 
tages of course of study. 
This first step being taken, it will become possible, then, to secure the desira- 
ble changes in the higher course of study. 4 
The gap between the elementary schools and, colleges.—President Eliot, of Harvard 
University : Only nine Massachusetts high schools send pupils to Harvard Col- 
lege every year. In 1889, out of 352 persons who were admitted to Harvard 
College as candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts, 97, or 274 per cent, were 
prepared at free public schools ; but these schools were only 30 in number from 
the whole country, 23 of them being New England schools. The plain fact is 
that not one-tenth of the schools called high in Massachusetts habitually main- 
tain a course of study which enables the pupil to prepare himself for admission

to Harvard College, or to any other college in the State which enforces its re- 
quirements for admission as stated in its catalogue. = <d 
If this is the condition of things in what may be called an urban State, what 
must it be inarural? Ifa patriot were compelled to choose between two alter- 
natives, one that the less intelligent half of his countrymen should be com- 
pletelly illiterate, the other that half of the select children capable of receiving 
the highest instruction should be cut off from that instruction, which would he 
choose? He would find the decision a dreadful one to make ; for eith 
tive would entail an incalculable loss upon his country. Yet in the present con- 
dition of secondary educatjon one-half of the most capable children in the United 
States, at a moderate estimate, have really no open road to colleges and uni- 
versities. I rehearse these well-known facts that we may appreciate the gravity 
of the problems presented by the subject. * * * Recognizing the plain fact 
of to-day that secondary schools are sufficient in number and defective in quality, 
what can colleges do, under these adverse circumstances, to make themselves 
as useful as possible to the population while awaiting a better organization of 
secondary education? Is it not their plain duty to maintain two schedules of 
requirements, one for the degree of bachelor of arts, the other for the degree of 
bachelor of science (or some equivalent), the latter demanding muth less pre- 
    paratory study than the former? The American colleges have been severely ~ 
criticized for offering to receive students of confessedly inferior preparation to 
that required of candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts; but even the 
oldest and strongest of them have done this, and from a genuine desire, as I be- 
  lieve, to be serviceable toas large a proportion as possible of American youth. One - 
lower grade of admission examination, leading to a distinct degree, is an expe- 
dient concession to the feeble condition of secondary education throughout the 
country. That grade of secondary schools which can not prepare pupils for the 
bachelor of arts course, but can prepare them for the bachelor of science course, * will so be brought into servicedble connection with the colleges. * * 
I venture to think that some colleges have gone unnecessarily far in offering — 
different courses with descending requirements for admission and different de- 
grees. They seem to say if a candidate can not get into our classical course, 
perhaps he can enterthe literary course; if not the literary, then the scientific; 
if not the scientific, at any rate the agricultural. The value of all degre 
to me to be diminished by this unnecessary multiplicity of titles and conditions, 
and the standards of good secondary schools must needs be unfavorably affected 
by a long sliding scale of admission requirements to the several courses offered 
by a single institution. 
Turning now from the consideration of the palliatives which colleges may re- 
sort to in the present feeble and distracted condition of secondary education, I 
pass to the more attractive study of the remedies for existing evils and defects.    
To improve secondary education in the United States two things are neces- 
sary: (1) More schools are needed, and (2) the existing schools need to be — 
brought to common and higher standards, so that the colleges may find in the 
school courses a firm, broad, and reasonably homogeneous foundation for their 
higher work. 
  1. More schools.—Secondary schools are either day schools or boarding schools, ~ 
the urban school being primarily a day school and the rural a boarding school. 
The public secondary school is now urban almost exclusively, and it must be ad- 
mitted that itis likely to continue so, for no promising suggestion has as yet 
been made of a rural area of support for a highly organized secondary school. 
It is admitted that neither a rural township nor a union of contiguous rvral dis- 
tricts can support such aschool. The county has been suggested as a possible 
area of support, but there is no sufficient evidence that a rural county, apart 
from its town or towns of dense population, could support a good high school. 
To increase the present number of secondary schools which can really fit pupils 
for college, what are the most hopeful lines of action? In the first place every 
effort should be made by school authorities, the press, and all leaders of public. 
opinion to promote the establishment of secondary urban day schools, both pub- 
lic and private, and to adapt the programmes of existing schools to the admis- 
sion requirements of some college course which leads to a degree. It is notice- - 
able that in the older cities, and to some extent in the younger also, the best 
private schools exist right beside the best public schools. The causes which 
produce one class of schools simultaneously produce the other. Secondly, rural 
communities ought to be authorized by suitable legislation to contribute to the 
esiablishment (including in that term the provisionof building) and annual sup- 
port of urban secondary schools which are conveniently situated for their use. 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
1114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Thirdly, there should be created by law special secondary school districts much 
larger than the areas which support primary and grammar schools and taking 
account of railroad communications. It is much easier for a boy or girl to go 
to school 15 miles by rail than to walk to school in ail weather 2 miles by 
eountry lanes. The rural population has something to hope from legislative 
recognition of railroads as chief features in secondary school districts. The 
Massachusetts normal schools illustrate this principle, for they are really high 
schools, partly boarding schools, and partly local and railroad day schools. 
Fourthly, every effort should be made to stimulate private benevolence to en- 
dow rural secondary boarding schcols or academies .under corporate manage- 
ment. A boarding school ought always to be in the country and a raral secon- 
_ dary school would almost necessarily be, in part at least, a boarding schcol. 
2. Common schools.—The existing means of elevating and regulating secondary 
school instruction may be conveniently considered under two heads: (a) State 
aid and supervision, and (b) college admission requirements. Both agencies are 
_ already useful, but both may be greatly improved and extended. 
. {a) State aid and supervision.—it seems to have been the object of high-schcol 
legislation in some States, as, for example, in Massachusetts and in Maine, to en- 
courage the creation of a large number of low-grade highschools without really 
expecting them to effect any junction with colleges. Such at any rate has te2n 
the effect of the mandatory legislation of Massachusetts, and such must be the 
general result of the aid offered to free high schools by Maine. This unpros- 
perous State now offers to give any free high school as much money per year as 
its supporting area annually appropriates for instruction in the school, provided 
the State grant shall not exceed $250 in any case. Noinspection or examination 
of aided'schools is provided for. Such legislation encourages the es‘ablishment 
of numerous weak schools, without helping appreciably the schcols already 
strong. _ = ; 
Much wiser is the legislation of Minnesota, Which established twelve years 
ago a State high-school board, and offered $400 a year to any high school which 
  wasfound by the board after competent inspection to fulfill the following con-- 
ditions: The aided school must receive both sexes free, and nonresident pupils 
also without fees, provided such pupils can pass examinations in all common- 
- school subjects below algebra and geometry, and must maintain ‘‘regular and 
orderly courses of study; embracing all the branches prescribed as prerequisite 
fo» admission to the collegiate department of the University of Minnesota not 
lower than the subfreshman class.” * * * This high-school legislation seems 
to me the wisest which has been adopted in the United Stat2s. It encourages 
only schools which are already well organized ; insists that aided schools shall 
connect directly with the university; avoids expensive examinations, provides 
any needed amount of inspection; grades schools by their programme and gen- 
eral efficiency, not by individual examination results; gives no pecuniary ad- 
vantage to a large school over one equally well conducted but smaller; requires 
aided schools to take nonresident pupils without charge ; and applies almost the 
whole of the State’s grant to the direct development of instruction, which is by 
far the most productive application of any money intended to benefit. schools. xe 
It is unquestionable that the New York State regents’ examinations have 
tended to raise the average standard of instruction in the academies and high 
schools, to extend and improve school programmes, to bring schools and colleges 
together by doing away with useless diversities of programmes insecondary schools 
and useless diversities of admission requirements in colleges, and to stimulate 
some of the communities which maintain these schools to give them better sup- 
- port-and to take prideintheir standing. These are great services which deserve 
the respectful attention of the other States of the Union and of all persons in- 
terested in the creation of an American system of secondary education. The 
regents have proved that a State examining board can exercise a stimulating, 
elevating, and unifying influence upon hundreds of institutions of secondary 
education scattered over alarge State, and can wield that power with machinery 
which, considering the scale of operations, may fairly be called simple and in- 
expensive. * * * : 
(6) Let-us turn now to the consideration of coliege admission requirements as 
means of raising and controlling secondary school instruction. 
College requirements for admission act effectively only on those secondary 
schools which prepare some of their pupils for college; upon that large propor- 
tion of high schools and academies which do not they have only an indirect al- 
though sensible effect. For the broad purposes of the State the influene> of 
   
-P-A-G-E-523
    
        
or : “COURSES OF STUDY. — ~ : 1115 
colleges, even if they were associated together, could not be so immediate and 
potent as the influence of the State, whether the lattor were exerted by inspec- 
tion or by examination. It is in anarrower field, therefore, that the higher in- 
stitutions of education can act on the lower. At present they act in three ways. 
The feeblest way is by prescribing for admission a knowledge of certain books 
or of certain well-defined subjects, and then admitting candidates on the certifi- 
cate of any schoolmaster that they have gone over all the prescribed books or 
subjects. If the prescriptions of the college are judicious, they are not without 
some favorable effect on the curricula of the certifying schools; but it may be 
reasonably objected to this method that it gives the college very inadequate pro- 
tection against incompetent students and the public no means of forming a just 
estimate of different schools. Certificates are apt to be accepted from good and 
bad schools alike, the anxiety to secure students in a struggling college over- 
viding every other consideration. Particularly is this apt to be the case ina 
small college in which the president has succeeded in getting the subject of admis- 
sion out of the hands of the faculty and into his own. Under this system a really 
good school hasno means of proving itself good, and a bad school is notpromptly 
exposed. Within a few years the feeblest of all methods has come into use, 
without any safeguards whatever, in the large majority of New England colleges, 
no system of State inspection or examination existing there, and no pretense 
being made that the certifying schools are examined, or even occasionally 
yisited, by the colleges. A more demoralizing method of establishing a close 
connection between secondary schools and colleges it would be hard to imagine. 
Nevertheless, even under this loose and unguarded method, which only the two 
largest New England colleges have completely resisted, some good has resulted 
from codperative action between preparatory schools and colleges to make ad- 
mission requirements, on paper at least, uniform for the same subjects... The 
uniform requirements in English, which prevail all over-New England except 
at Yale University, and have lately been adopted by some: institutions in the — 
Middle States, supply a noteworthy case in point. : See 
The method just described is a corruption or degradation of a somewhat safer 
method of securing close connection between secondary schools and colleges 
which was first adopted twenty years ago by the University of Michigan. This 
safer method, as developed by that university, amounts to this: The university 
admits candidates on the diplomas given by any schools, near or remote, within 
the State or without, which are visited once in three years by a committee of 
the faculty, or by other persons designated by the university. he visit may 
be repeated if any important changes take place in a school within the three 
years. The diplomas must specify that the candidatss have sustained examina- 
tions at school in all the studies prescribed for admission to one or other of the 
university courses leading toadegree. There were in 1889 seventy schools hold- 
ing this “diploma relation” to the University of Michigan. Itcan not be doubted 
that this method is well adapted for recruiting rapidly a single dominant State 
university ; but its value as a method for general adoption obviously depends on 
  the thoroughness, impartiality, and publicity of the inspection which it provides. ~~ 
To me the inspection seems to fail on all three points. Considering the rapidity 
with which teachers are changed in American schools, an inspection once in three 
‘eal seems too infrequent. Iam wholly ata loss to understand how a busy col- 
ege faculty can get time to inspect properly any considerable number of secon- 
dary schools, or how it can furnish a sufficient number of inspectors competent 
in all secondary-school subjects. * * * Itis also obvious that the method is 
not public enough in its processes to demonstrate its fairness and sufficiency, and 
therefore tocommand generalconfidence. The singleacting authority obviously 
hasinterests of its own toserve. Iamnot maintaining that this diploma method, — 
as conducted in Michigan, has not worked well, or even that it has not worked 
so well as the method of admission by examination, as conducted in Michigan. 
It is some gain to establish friendly relations between seventy secondary schools 
and any university. Iam urging thatitlacks adequate securities, and is there- 
fore not fit for general adoption. The Minnesota method, which provides in 
the State high-school board an independent inspecting authority, is in my opin- 
ion greatly to be preferred. - 
There remains the most effective mode in which colleges act on the superior 
sort of secondary schools, namely, the method of conducting careful examination 
in.all the subjects acceptable for admissicn. These examinations have a fair 
degree of publicity; for the most colleges circulate freely their question papers. 
Harvard College also publishes in detail the results of its examinations for ad- 
mission. Such examinations are no longer, as formerly, he'd only at the seat of
-P-A-G-E-524
      1116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
the college conducting theta, but may be held simultaneously at as many places 
as the convenience of candidates may require. Several Eastern colleges now 
conduct examinations at numerous places widely distributed over the country. 
" Yale University distinctly announces that it will hold an admission examination 
‘in any city or at any school where the number of candidates and the distance 
from. other places of examination may warrant it.” The method can easily be 
given a national application by any institution which has prestige and a numer- 
ous staff. In the long run it grades schools fairly, and it is very stimulating to 
the older classes of secondary schools. Like all examinations conducted by an 
authority independent of the schools, it also protects the masters of schools, both 
public and private, against the unwarrantable importunities of parents, trustees, 
and-committeemen. Nevertheless it is open to some serious objections. In the 
first place it is not sufficiently public. The question papers may look well; but 
the standard for passing may be unreasonably low, the public having no means 
of estimating the degree of strictness with which the answer papers are marked. 
Secondly, the colleges have, until lately, acted singly, each for itself, without 
consultation or concert. Each college or university is, therefore, naturally sup- 
posed to be seeking its own interest rather than the commonwelfare. Thirdly, 
in asmall college a few men, who perhaps have peculiarities or whims, may con- 
trol all the admission examinations for many years to the disadvantage of the 
college and the annoyance of schools. All these.evils would be removed or re- 
duced by a system of codperation among several colleges. % 
At+the conclusion of this rapid survey I venture to suggest that there are 
three directions in which patriots who desire tosee American secondary schools 
improved and connected more closely with colleges may look for progress: 
1. I may expect State examining and inspecting systems to improve and ex- 
tend, for they have demonstrated their utility ; and remembering the extremes 
to which examination methods have been carried in England, we may reasona- 
bly hope that State boards will inspect institutions more and more thorougaly, 
as well as examine individuals. In this connection we expect that the profes- 
sion of school inspector will become well recognized as a separate and honorable 
ealling. 
2. We may hope to see formed a combination of four-or six of the universities 
which have large departments of arts and sciences to conduct simultaneously, at 
well-selected points all over the country, examinations in all the subjects any- 
where acceptable for admission to colleges or professional schools, the answer 
papers to be marked by persons annually selected by the combined universities 
and announced to the public, all results to be published, but without the names 
of candidates, and certificates to be good anywhere for the subjects mentioned 
in them. We see reason to believe that such a codperative system would be 
simple, though extensive; that it would present no serious difficulties, mechan- 
ical or other ; that it would be very convenient and economical for candida‘es, 
and self-supporting at a moderate fee; and finally that it would be authorita- 
tive, flexible, stimulating, unifying, and just. 
3. We may expect to see a great extension of the scholarship system, whereby 
promising youth are helped through secondary schools and colleges. States, 
cities, towns, and endowments provided by private benevolence will all contrib- 
ute to the development of this well-proved system.   
Principles which may govern an CREO to bring about uniformity of college admis- 
sion.—From a report to the National Council of Education, James H. Baker, 
chairman of committee (1891): 
(1) By comparison of the requirements of leading colleges a standard classical 
course may be selected which could at once be adopted without essential modi- 
fication by those colleges. 
_ (2) A preparatory course omitting Greek may also be recommended in which 
the substitution for Greek shall fall within regular high-school work. Such a 
course may be made up from the catalogues of those colleges which do not re- 
quire Greek. It may here be noted that in this country, in Germany, and in 
England there are indications that Greek is no longer to be compulsory for col- 
lege and university degrees. But at the same time the advantage of taking at 
least one classical language, especially the Latin, is strongly urged. The head 
master of Harrow, while he would not make Greek a compulsory study, urges 
the desirability of retaining Latin about as follows: ‘‘For scientific study a 
dead language possesses an advantage in that it does not. invite the sacrifice of 
accuracy to utility. Latin is the language of law, of liberty, of religion. It is 
the parent of half the languages in Europe. It is strong and precise im gram- 
matical idioms. It is furnished with the necessary means and appliances for 
 
-P-A-G-E-525
  COURSES OF STUDY. 1117 
teaching. I can not help thinking it would be an edu@ational mistake of-serious 
magnitude to lose the universality if the Latin language as an element of the 
higher education.” We may add that Latin is required or advocated by most 
scientific schools and that its retention is generally desired, 
(3) Colleges and preparatory schools not at present able to adopt standard 
preparation in full should pursue standard lines so that the work would all count 
toward the desired end, if the pupil wished to supplement it for an institution 
of the best class. : 
(4) A complete adjustment of the relation between high schools and colleges 
should be sought on the basis of a general high-school course: This idea will 
be subject to special consideration. 
The committee will venture to suggest a classical preparatory course made up 
from the catalogues of several of the best colleges. In this course a little is 
taken from the Latin required by some colleges, and a concession is made to 
those which demand a modern language and some science and literature. 
Physics is selected because it includes more generic principles than any other 
science. The committee believes that this course thus made up is not a jumble 
of fragments, but that it has a natural coherence in plan and purpose, as much 
as any one of the courses upon which it is based. It should be especially noted 
that this course is suggested, not as the best possible one, but rather as an ex- 
ample of a course that might be established. It is also intended to show the 
folly of the present variations. 
CLASSICAL COURSE. 
Mathematics.—Algebra (elementary, complete); Plane geometry (with :exer- 
cises). 
Greck.—Four books of Anabasis; 3 books of Iliad; limited amount of sight 
reading ; composition. 
Latin.—Four books of Cesar; 7 orations of Cicero; 6 books of Aineid; limited 
amount of sight reading ; composition. 
Hrench.—Kasy translation. 
Science.—Physics, with experiments and notes. 
History.— Greece and Rome (geography incidental). ; 
English.—As recommended by the New England Association. ‘ 
The colleges admitting without Greek substitute increased amounts of mathe- 
matics, of science, or of the modern languages. Therefore the following substi- 
tutes for Greek may be suggested, the rest of the course remaining the same as 
the regular classical course. The additional sciences selected have the prestige 
of influential recommendation. 
COURSE-OMITTING GREEK. 
[Substitutions for Greek.] 
Solid geometry and plane trigonometry. 
Additional year of French. 
Chemistry (with experiments and notes) and botany. 
Remainder of course same as classical. 
A careful comparison of the courses above suggested as a provisional basis for 
uniformity with the courses of standard colleges will show that most colleges, 
high and preparatory schools could at once afiord to agree to some such uniform 
requirements, and that the changes necessary for an adjustment would in no 
instance be vital or even important. Could uniform courses once be recom- 
mended by an influential convention of colleges and schools, every fitting school 
could adopt the one standard and say to the colleges, ‘‘ Take our students if you 
wish them.”. Mostcollegés would be compelled to adopt the courses recommended. 
But by far the most important and most troublesome problem is the complete 
adjustment of higher to secondary education. In the opinion of the committee 
the connection must be made by adjusting the colleges to the secondary schools 
and not the secondary schools to the colleges. President Eliot some years since 
pointed out that a good high-school finishing course must become more and 
more a good preparatory course. Mr. Harris is understood to maintain that the 
studies adapted to the age of secondary education should also furnish a good 
college preparation. This is in accord also with Mr. Hill’s principles in the 
‘““Trus order of studies.” It would be unsafe to deny that secondary education, 
which is adapted to the development of the mental powersand the enlargement   
     
-P-A-G-E-526
1118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
of knowledge in the giv@n period, is a good preparation for higher education. 
If elementary science and history and literature and art, as well as mathematics 
and classical languages, are adapted to the period of secondary education, then 
they are excellent as a basis for college work. 
From the tendency of our institutions we must believe that more and more 
will the high schools become feeders of the colleges. The interests of colleges 
and high schools will be greatly enhanced by the clogest union, and one import- 
ant result will be an increase in the number who will seek higher education. 
There is one great advantage in postponing to as late a day as possible the necessity 
of decision regarding a college course. Whenever a boy decides to go to college 
he should find himself on the road thither. 
Already Michigan University and the University of California admit toa 
four years’ general course without any foreign language, while Northwestern 
University admits students with only one foreign language, ancient or modern. 
The State universities, we think, can afford to meet the regular work of the 
high schools. It is understood that there are some troublesome adjustments 
arising from the union of classical and English students in college classes. In 
large colleges the problem is notserious, because classes are divided. Insmaller 
institutions a list of electives will make the necessary adjustment possible. Even 
in an inflexible course some substitutions are possible, as solid geometry and 
plane trigonometry for freshman mathematics. This phase of the prob'em, 
however, is not the most serious one. 
We will proceed to suggest a high-school course that might be generally 
adopted. We include it in the five ‘fundamental disciplines” pointed out by 
Mr. Harris—a selection in general harmony with Mr. Hill’s analysis. Since 
this theory of studies is now widely adopted we expect no opposition to our basie 
principles. In choice of specific studies, in arrangement, and amounts we are 
governed in part by comparison of many courses of study, as well as by thought 
upon relative values. The committee indorses the custom of requiring a foreign 
language in a high-school course, and for reasons previously cited would give 
the preference to Latin. The committee does not advance a definite opinion 
that more than one course is necessary for a high school or that the preparatory 
and the finishing courses might be identical, We simply suggest a basis for 
present uniformity and adjustment under existing conditions. 
GENERAL HIGH-SCHOOL COURSE. 
Mathematics.— Algebra, plane and solid geometry, plane trigonometry. 
Foreign Languages.—At least three years of some foreign language, Greek or 
Latin or French or German, but preferably Latin. 
Science.—Physiology, physics, chemistry, and at least botany or zodlogy, and 
geology or astronomy, and mental science. 
History.—Greek, Roman, English, and epochs of modern civil government; 
political economy. 
English.—History of literature, study of selections, rhetoric, compositions. 
Avi.—Drawing.and music. ( 
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TOWARD UNIFORMITY. 
In the interest of uniformity the ‘‘Association of Colleges and Preparatory 
Schools” and the ‘‘Commission of Colleges” in New England have been formed, 
and progress has been made in recommending and securing the adoption of uni- 
form requirements in English, in Greek and Latin, and in modern languages. 
The State of Ohio has secured an agreement between the colleges and high 
schools through the mediation of the State Teachers’ Association.. The plan 
there adopted tends to make a perfect connection between high schools and 
colleges. The report of Prof. King and that of Mr. White, made during the 
consideration of the problem, contain many valuable suggestions. Many other 
States through their associations or their State universities are aiming at uni- 
formity and at a closer relation between the colleges and the high schools. But 
it should be noted that State uniformity may hinder rather than aid national 
uniformity. State boundaries have nothing whatever to do with the choice of a 
college. As soon as possible educators should make the question a national one, 
instead of wasting energy in creating organized differences.

‘Teachers’ Association and Association of Ohio Colleges:

    LIMITATIONS OF THE HIGH SCH@OL. 
Before submitting plans for full adjustment, your committee desires tostate as 
clearly as possible the limitations of the high school as a preparatory school. 
These limitations are both economic and pedagogic. The fact that more than 
three-fourths of the pupils in our high schools will never enter higher institu- 
tions establishes the necessity of making the training therein the best possible 
asa final school course, whatever this may be. If this best possible high-school 
  couRsEs ‘OF srupy, © Oo at 
course is an adequate preparation for college, the proper articulation of the high — 
school and college is secured. If, however, an additional course must be pro- 
, vided for the few who may wish to prepare for college, an additional demand is 
made on the resources of the high school—a demand which a large number of 
high schools may not be able to meet. 
Besides, it is not possible for pupils, with few exceptions, to determines, on en- 
tering the high school, whether the way will be clear for them to go to college, 
Many who start with such a hope fall out by the way, and others, as they pro- 
ceed in their studies, awaken to the desire for a higher education and see an op- 
portunity to acquire it. 
These facts show the impossibility of wisely classifying high-school pupils 
with respect to their future participation in college advantages. Whenever the 
desire to go to college takes possession of a pupil—and every high school should 
be a thost potent awakener of such a desire—he should find himseif in a direct 
read io the college gate. y 
But it is not enough that the high-school course looks directly to the college. 
It should also furnish the great body of its pupils with the best possible training, 
and, to this end, its.course of study must be based on sound pedagogical princi- 
ples. These principles clearly teach, as Dr. W. T. Harris has ably shown, that 
a true course of study must include all of the five great divisions of human 
knowledge, to wit, mathematics, language and philosophy, natural and physical 
science, history and government, and literature and art. It must also recognize ~ 
the fact that each of these great divisions of knowledge has itsnatural sequence 
or development, corresponding to the mind’s development, and this sequence cr 
order must be observed, not only in the course of study, but in school instruction. 
To adopt Dr. Thomas Hill’s famous simile, in his ‘True order of studies,” a true 
course of study is like a spiral stairway surrounding the five great columns of hu- 
man knowledgeand cutting off a section of each at each round ofitsascent. The 
special weakness of too many high-school courses is that they attempt to cut off 
sections of these columns that belong to a higher phase of mental development— 
that fall in the period of college training. 
In harmony with these principles, a high-school course of study may properly 
include (1) algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and arithmetic (review); {2) lan- 
guage, including English and Latin orGerman or French; (3)science, including 
physical geography, physiology, and the elements of botany or zoélogy, physics, 
and chemistry; (4) history, including United States history and general history, 
and civil government; and (5) English literature and art, the latter including 
at least drawing, music, and vocal culture. 
The experience of the high-schools of the country shows that itis not possible 
to give these several branches of study due proportionate attention if one-half 
of the time of the pupils is devoted to language, and this must be the case when 
the course includes both Latin and Greek in addition to English. The daily 
programme of a high school may wisely provide four daily class exercises for 
each pupil, provided these exercises do not exceed forty minutes each, and this 
is sufficient time for the best class work in high schools. When only one daily 
period is devoted to, say, Latin, in addition to English, itis not difficult to ar- 
range a programme that will give due attention to the other four great branches 
of knowledge. 
_ Your committee desires to emphasize the importance of making Latin one of 
the daily studies of the high school. A wide experience has shown that this is 
notonly the best possible way of meeting the demand for language training, the 
best ideal training in language as logic, but it is the mostfruitful element in the 
best possible preparation for higher courses, whether classical, scientific, philo- 
sophic or technological. It is regretted that there is not time to cite some of 
the conclusive evidence on which this vlaim for Latin as a high-school study is 
based. When Latin is omitted, either German or French should be taken. A 
true course of high-school training requires that the pupil take at least one lan- 
guage in addition to English.

  1120 © : EDUCATION “REPORT, 1889-90, 
When we have found tiie best possible course of study for high schools we have 
found, as acousequence, what ought to be an adequate preparation for college, 
whatever the course to be pursued therein. A true college course ought to 
rest upon a true high-school course. In aphilosophicscheme of education there 
_ is no occasion to adjust higher and secondary coursesof study. The former rests xe - uponand articulates with the latter. * 
PLANS OF ADJUSTMENT. 
I.—On the side of the high school. 
The general or regular course of study in the high schools of Ohio should in- 
elude : 
1. Latin, its study beginning with and extending through the entire course— 
certainly not less than three years. It is not meant that all pupils in the high 
school should be required to take Latin, butefficient instruction in Latin should 
be provided, and as many pupils as possible be induced to take it. A conscien- 
tious effort should be made by all high-school teachers to induce at least all 
pupils who enter with the intention of completing the course to take Latin as 
the best possible course for them, whatever may be their future education or 
occupation. What is needed is an enthusiastic appreciation of Latin on the 
part of high-school teachers. When Latin is not taken, German or (for tempo- 
rary pupils) a wider and more practical course in English may take its place. 
2. Mathematics; elementary algebra being taken the first year ; geometry, 
plane and solid, the second year; and spherical geometry, higher algebra (at 
least one-half year) and trigonometry and arithmetic (reviewed) in the third 
‘and fourth years. The putting of co-called ‘‘higher” arithmetic at the begin- 
ning of the high-school course is a serious mistake—a clear violation of sound 
principles of teaching, and a consequent waste of effort and opportunity. Hight 
years of training in arithmetic certainly ought to prepare the pupil for the suc- 
cessful study of the elements of algebra. It is also a mistake to put the study 
of higher algebra before geometry. The mathematics of form, as Dr. Hill has 
clearly shown, is easier and more elementary than the mathematics of abstract 
relations. 
It will be observed that the mathematics here assigned to the third and fourth 
year's (arithmetic excepted) belong properly to the college course; but high- 
school pupils, if well taught and not hurried, can master these branches in the 
last two years, and this, as will be hereafter seen, will make feasible a needed 
change and adjustment in the college course. When instruction in Greek is 
provided in the high school it can take the place of these higher mathematical 
branches in the third and fourth year, the mathematics of the first two years, 
with arithmetic, being sufficient for admission to college. 
3. Physical science, including physical geography, physiology, and the elements 
of at least twoof these four sciences, viz, zodlogy, botany, physics, and chem- 
istry. When physiology is taught in the grammar grades, zodlogy or boiany 
and the elements of physics and chemistry may be readily taught in the high 
school. This instruction in science should begin with and extend through the 
entire course, with three or four exercises each week. The aim of the course 
should be to make the pupils familiar with those concepts and facts that con- 
stitute the elements of these sciences, and to this end the pupils should study, 
as far as practicable, things and phenomena and not text-book language about 
these things. In science the study of things is a necessary preparation for the 
study of books, and hence science instruction in the high school should be 
largely objective. Thisis the significance of the modern laboratory and mu- 
seum, appliances greatly needed in all high schools. 
4, History and civil government, the former including United States history 
(if not taught in grammar grades) and general history. Fully one year, three 
to four lessons each week, should be devoted to general history, and not less 
than half a*year to civil government. : 
5. English literature and art, the former including composition and rhetoric 
and literature Proper, and the latter at least drawing, music, and vocal culture. © 
‘au It is the general testimony of college teachers that college matriculates are de- 
ficient in English, and especially in the power to express their knowledge clearly 
and accurately. To remove this defect pupils should not only study the great 
masters of expression, but synthetic training in the art of language should re- 
ceive more attention.

    “COURSES OF STUDY. 1121 
It is believed that the general course of study outlined above is within the 
resources.and reach of the high schools of the State, and especially of those 
schools which employ two or more teachers. It is based on the actual experi- 
ence of the best schools. The changes made for the purpose of adjustment re- 
late chiefly to mathematics and Latin, and these features have already been 
tested by school experience. : 
Your committee desires, in this connection, to emphasize the importance of a 
wiser concentration of energy in high-school instruction. The undue multipli- 
cation of branches of study and text-books is a serious dissipation of power. The 
principal aim of the high school is to give its pupils efficient training in the fun- 
damental studies—what Dr. Harris calls the “fundamental disciplines.” 
Il.—On the side of the college. 
The course of study outlined above is an adequate preparation for all bachelor 
courses in college, the A. B. course alone excepted, and here the difficulty re- 
lates exclusively to the Greek. The colleges are at liberty to require for admis- 
sion to all bachelor courses (1) requisite knowledge and skill in the common’ ~ 
branches; (2) Latin, at least three yéars, and for technical courses either Latin 
or German; (3) the elements of algebra and plane and solid geometry ; (4) Eng- 
lish and English literature (character and amount to be announced at least one 
year in advance); (5) United States history and general history (limited); (6) 
physiology, physical geography, and the elements of at least two of these four 
sciences—botany, zodlogy, physics, and chemistry; and (7) drawing, music, and 
vocal culture. ~ 
In place of the Greek now required for admission to the A. B. course, they 
may call for spherical geometry, higher algebra (full one-half year), and trigo- 
nometry, at least plane—in other words, for present freshman mathematicS— 
and also for some extra Latin, if necessary, and for one year of present college 
instruction in botany and zodlogy and physics and chemistry, now provided for 
in the high-school course. 
Your committee suggests the following plans for meeting the absence of 
Greek preparation: 
1. An acceptance of preparation in freshman mathematics (outlined above for 
third and.fourth years of high school course) as a full substitute for one year of 
Greek. This change can be met in the college in two ways. Students who 
enter without Greek but with freshman mathematics can‘ be permitted (1) to de- 
vote in the first year two recitation periods daily to Greek, omitting mathe-. 
matics, or (2) what may be better, one period daily in freshman year to Greek 
and one to sophomore mathematics, and in the second year two periods daily to 
Greek, omitting mathematics. 
It is believed that either of these plans will bring the student who matricu- 
lates without Greek, but with extra mathematics, to the junior year regular in 
all his studies, and this, too, without serious loss or inconvenience. To the col- 
lege it involves the expense of two extra daily exercises in Greek for one year 
or one extra daily exercise for two years; and every fairly endowed college 
ought, to be able to furnish this extra instruction. 
2. A more radical plan of adjustment and a better one in the bringing of 
Greek wholly within the college course, as has been done successfully by several ~ 
State universities. This change brings all the college courses into harmony 
with the high-school course outlined above. The adjustment of the courses is 
complete. Students who enter with two full years of Greek preparation can 
enter the junior class in Greek, and those with one year of Greek the sopho- 
more class in Greek, the only changes required being in the recitation scheme 
or programme. No extra instruction in Greek is required. 
Four years ought to be sufficient for the thorough mastery of the present 
Greek course, now requiring as a rule five years. It is believed that a year can 
easily be saved by making the Greek instruction continuous and more enthusi- 
astic, and, as John Stuart Mill once clearly pointed out, time can also be saved 
by the use of better methods of teaching. (Besides, extra Greek as an elective 
ean easily be provided in the senior year.) 
AGENCY FOR EFFECTING PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS. 
It is clearly not sufficient to devise and adopt plans for adjusting high-school 
and college courses of study. What is also needed is the providing of an effi- 
cient agency for carrying these plans into effect; and here the experience of

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
several of the States is suggestive—notably of New York, Michigan, and Min- 
nesota. 
The following plan for Ohio is recommended : 
1. Let the association *f Ohio colleges, or, if preferred a league of those Ohio 
colleges that may be willing thus to coiperate, formulate and prescribe the 
minimum requirements for admission to the several courses in each of the col- 
leges associated, the same to be announced at least one year in advance. These 
requirements should be made definite, and they should fall within the general 
course of study above outlined for the high schools of the State. 
2. Let committees be appointed by the college association, each representing 
- at least two colleges, to visit the high schools within easy reach, and by per- 
- sonal inquiry and inspection determine whether such high schools are able to 
furnish the necessary preparatory training for one or all of the college courses, 
as indicated in the prescribed requirements for admission, the results and con- 
-elusions to be reported to a general committee of the association. 
-* 3. Let the high schools found worthy of such indorsement be put on a list of 
approved high schools and to give increased interest and weight to such ap- 
_proval let the graduates of these schools be admitted on application to any of 
the associated colleges without examination, save it may be in one of the more 
“disciplinary branches, as Latin or algebra and geometry. These examinations 
might be helpful in securing greater attention to these studies and also in es- 
tablishing a higher standard of attainment in them. 
The visits of these examining committees should be improved to interest 
teachers and pupils in higher education and also to create a livelier interest in 
the community in the character of its high schools. It is easy to see how such 
visits could be made important occasions for strengthening the high schools as 
well as increasing interest in college education. The fact that these committees 
represent the colleges of the State and no partieular institution would largely 
remove embarrassment on the part of the examining visitors. Of course no 
school should be visited without prior permission. 
The faculty of the University of Michigan has for many years carried out a 
plan similar to the one commended above, and itis the testimony of all con- 
' cerned that it has brought the high schools into closer relations with the uni- 
versity and headed many young pape toward its halls. It has also. greatly 
improved and strengthened the high schools of the State in public interest. 
Citizens take a special pride in seeing the high school of their eity or town on 
the approved list and the visits of the university committees are made ecca- 
sions of special interest. 
The demands of the colleges on the secondary schools.—School and College: The 
problem of earlier graduation from college has in New England led to a some- 
what odd result, a positive demand for a reform in the curriculum of the ele- 
mentary schools. The colleges having in recent years appreciably increased 
their demands upon the secondary schools, are not now so inconsistent as to call 
for the accomplishment of the greater rate of labor in a shorter period, but are 
joining in a claim that more of the preparation for college should be done before 
the fifteenth year of the pupil’s life. Two methods of accomplishing this are 
suggested—the ‘‘clipping-down process,” by which the pupils who are to go to 
colleze shall be taken out of the elementary schools at the age of 11 or 12 
and transferred to schools which shall specially prepare them for college; and 
the “enrichment” method, by which certain subjects essential in preparation 
for college may be begun three or four yearsearlier than they now are, and may 
- be taken in the elementary schools. There are difficulties in both the proposed 
methods. 
The relation of grammar and high school education to collegiate —Frank A. Hill, 
head master Cambridge English High School: The great majority of pupils in 
the two hundred and fifty high schools of Massachusetts are pursuing a course 
- of study that does not connect with the college. For such pupils the high school 
is a cul-de-sac, leading nowhere. Harvard College welcomes connection with all 
good high schools. 1t has provided ayenues by which they may hope, one of 
these days, to prepare pupils without Greek. Unfortunately, it is harder to fit 
pupils for Harvard without Greek than with it. The greater demand is made 
on those less able to meet it. 
It stands to reason that a training suited to a person whose course must cease 
after four years in the high school ought to be worth following up in college 
should the high-school graduate desire to go higher. I urge most strongly the 
~ connection of the college with the public-school system all along the upper line, 
     
-P-A-G-E-531
    1123 
not simply at those favored points where the classically trained touch the col- 
lege. This connection would reduce the age of admission of many a belated 
pupil. This connection once established, a certain absurdity would disappear. 
‘Who would have dreamed, in advance of knowledge offthis absurdity, that sen- 
sible men were capable, first, of raising barriers between the high school and 
the college; secondly, of removing them between the high school and the pro- ~ COURSES OF STUDY. 
fessional school, and then, thirdly, of wondering why our youth so numerously __ 
skip the college to enter the professional school. Such inconsistencies are due 
to independent groups of men working at cross purposes, consequences natuzal 
enough under the intense localism of our educational systems, but impossib’e 
under the strong central authority of France or Germany. If both routes to the 
professional school are to be kept open, it is more pressing duty to lengthen 
and stiffen the secondary courses for the benefit of those who take the short 
route than to shorten and probably weaken them for the benefit of those who — 
take the long route. 
The pupil who begins at 6 and moves along normally may enter college at 19. 
This is young enough for average minds. Quick, strong minds may profitably 
enter a year or two earlier. For such the way should be shortened, but not by 
contracting the whole system. It should be'shortened, not solely for the purpose 
of keeping active minds sufficiently busy. The Harvard Grammar School, of 
Cambridge, is trying an interesting experiment in this direction. 
The time has come to consider the wisdom of increasing the range and the 
grade of scholarship within the pursuit limits of the grammar school. When 
we note how much the boys of the gymnasium and the lycée have accomplished 
by the time they reach 15, the question comes home whether our grammar-school 
pupils are working on a@ basis sufficiently liberal and with a spirit sufficiently 
serious. There are strong reasons, however, why they can not do as much as 
the pupils abroad. ‘We should be temperate in our suggestions of possible im- 
provement, * * * % 
The arithmetic course should be reduced to make room for algebra and geom- _ 
etry, algebra through equations of the first degree, and geometry in a way to 
test the observing, inventive, and reasoning faculties, but with recognition of 
the fact that its principles can be grasped for practical purposes long before it 
is possible for the average pupil to give the formal and rigorous demonstrations 
of Euclid. 
Elementary science should have a place. Thére is something seriously de- 
fective in our teaching if under it pupils do not gain in power to seo and to 
think. Geography should be made an observational study to an inereased ex- 
tent. This can be effected with the aid of the porte-lumiere, a darkened room, 
and stereopticon views. ; : 
I hesitate to recommend an additional language for the grammar schools. 
Latia would hardly be tolerated. I fear it would be difficult, except in highly in- 
telligent communities, to convince the public that French or German ought to 
be taken up in our grammar schools, although it is the practice abroad to begin 
a modern language very early. The additions proposed—they would be largely 
substitutions—should be worked out in a tentative way, some single school in 
an advanced community being selected for the experiment. 
The changes proposed would require more teachers of a high range of attain- 
ments. This is the coming opportunity for the voung women of the colleges as 
well as for. the grammar schools. The proportion of liberally educated young 
wonten is increasing ; the supply of such women for high schools promises be- 
fore long to exc2ed the demand. It will bea glad day when the public shall 
demand as generous preparation for the teachers of the lower schools as for 
thoze of the upper. , 
The difficulty is with the preparatory schools. —H. L. Stetson, president Des Moines 
(Iowa) College: If the proper preparatory work could be accomplished I think 
there would be no complaint with reference to the length of our present college 
courses. If the student could be started at 13 or 14 years in his preparatory 
work, and if it could be made to cover the subjects most essential for him to en- 
ter his college course, he would be able to graduate at the end of the four years 
at about the age of those young men who enter ths various professions without 
the college training; and the result of my investigation has led me to this con- 
clusion, that the whole difficulty is not in the college course,-but is in what leads 
to it. Our preparatory work is in such chaotic condition; we have so few thor- 
oughly good preparatory schcols. Some of them are engaged in teaching the 
classics and ot 1srs entirely in teaching-the sciences. Their pupils come to us 
without any rezular preparation, and they are compelled to spend more time in

preparing themselves for the four years than frequently is necessary to accom- 
- plish the entire course in college. In answer to these demands which have been 
_ - mae for increased a instruction the high schools—of the West particu- 
larly—and very many ofthe academies are devoting more and more time to the 
sciences and to English literature; and it may be, if this instruction is increased 
and made what it might be, our colleges may have to readjust their courses of 
study to this fact, requiring less of the classics for entrance and giving more at- 
- tention to them and more attention to advanced work in the sciences, and in this 
“way possibly we may be able to meet all the demand that is made for less time 
to secure an education. 
Suggestions.—D. C. Gilman, president Johns Hopkins University: (a) The au- 
thosities in our educational system should really, as well as nominally, distin- 
guish between the requirements of three scholastic periods, namely, the school, 
the college, and the university; or, in other words, between what is essential, 
what is liberal, and what is special in a prolonged education. 
(0) The period of college life, which of late years has been carried forward so 
that it extends on the average from 18.5 years to 22.5 years (in many, perhaps     
in most of the older colleges) may be brought back to anearlier age, say from 16 
to 20 years. f 
(c) The significance of the baccalaureate-degree school should be restored, so 
that it may be at least a trustworthy certificate, an approximate measure, both 
of the capacity and of the acquisitions of the possessor. In one way or another 
a consensus should be reached as to the ‘‘ dignities, rights, and privileges to that 
degree appertaining.” 
(d) The rigidity of the class system should be relaxed, so that those who are 
exceptionally favored or exceptionally strong may, if they choose, run the course 
in less than the average time; and likewise so that any who are embarrassed by 
iil health, the necessity of earning a support, or the inadequacy of their early op- 
- portunities may spend more than the usual time without any implied discredit; 
indeed, without attracting any attention. The exaggerated emphasis given to 
- the class system in our colleges seems to me most unfortunate. 
(e) The enormous waste of time and energy at the school period,.the time of 
preparation for college, must be arrested. * * * 
_ If these remedies could be adopted, what would be the result? School life 
would usually end at 16 years of age, when ‘“‘matriculation” in a college 
would*indicate that the scholar was ready for higher studies. College life 
would usually end at 20 years of age, when a bachelor’s degree would de- 
note the attainment of a liberal education. Those who are fieet would go over 
the coursein less time, and those who are handicapped would proceed at a 
slower rate. The hare would generally win; but, sometimes, the turtle. Pro- 
fessional or special education would then continue as long as the scholar might 
wish, three years being probably the usual period in schools of law, medicine, 
and theology. The young man would thus receive at 23 years or upwards 
his professional certificate or his diploma as a doctor of philosophy. He would 
have finished his university pupilage. An education like this would usually 
extend over eleven years—four in the preparatory school (from 12 to 16), four 
in college (from 16 to 20), and three in a professional school (from 20 to 23); but 
the period might be shortened or lengthened according to individual abilities 
or disabilities. If, then, the stronger universities would take the ground that, as 
a rule, none should be admitted to the professional courses, or to the freedom of 
university instruction, until they had attained a bachelor’s degree, or in some 
other way acquired a corresponding preparation for advanced work, the re- 
proaches of which we are conscious would soon disappear, and higher education 
penis. be more generally diffused, more wisely ordered, more serviceable to the 
public. 
Changes in the grammar-school programme,—The Association of Colleges in New 
England, at its annual meeting, November 5 and 6, 1891, resolved to recommend 
for gradual adoption the following changes in the programme of New England 
grammar schools: (1) The introduction of elementary natural history into ihe 
earlier years of the programme as a substantial subject, to be taught by demon- 
strations and practical exercises rather than from books; (2) the introduction 
of elementary physics into the later years of the programme as a substantial 
subject, to be taught by the experimental or laboratory method, and to include 
exact weighing and measuring by the pupils themselves; (3) the introduction 
_ of elementary algebraat an age notlater than 12 years; (4) the introduction of ele- 
mentary plane geometry at an age not later than 13 years; (5) the offering of

“COURSES OF STUDY. + 1125 
opportunity to study French or German or Latin, or any two of these languages 
from and after the age of 10 years. In order to make room in the programme 
for these new subjects the association recommends that the time allotted to 
arithmetic, geography, and English grammar be reduf€ed to whatever extent 
may be necessary. The association makes these recommendations in the intzr- 
est of the public-school system as a whole ; but most of them are offered more 
particularly in the interest of those children whose education is not to be con- 
tinued beyond the grammar school. 
Discussion of the changes recommended in the foregoing paragraph.—George H. 
Martin, agent of the Massachusetts board of education, in an address before the 
Massachusetts Schoolmasters’ Club: In discussing the proposed reforms I shall 
certainly limit myself to the class of pupils referred to in the memorandum is- 
sued by the college association, viz, pupils who are to leave school at 14. Con- 
eerning the first proposition to introduce elementary natural history in the 
earlier years there is practical unanimity among all public-school men. It was 
discussed by this club six years ago, and then the club was wholly in its fg vor. 
It is already a ‘‘substantial subject” in the best schools, and no school eu, ricu- 
lum of recent construction would be considered complete without it, an d itis 
taught everywhere objectively and not from books. It is true there is much 
erude and desultory work, but this is growing less as the limitations are re- 
moved. The subject is everywhere recognized as a most efficient instrument of 
training and is being used for that purpose. To say that it is in all schools in 
all communities would be to err, but the work is rapidly gaining, and its mo- 
mentum will not be sensibly increased by the belated impulse from the colleges. 
-I[am prepared to indorse heartily the proposition to introduce elementary 
physics into the later years. It should be taught by experiment, and is already 
so taught in some grammar schools, but the ‘‘ laboratory method” is not practical 
for grammar schools, nor is ‘‘exact weighing and measuring by the pupils them- 
selves.” This requires individual opportunity and time, neither of which the 
pupils in the grammar schools can have, and a degree of self-control which 
children under 14 have not acquired. Nor is this work desirable. What these 
children do need is some knowledge of the simple principles of natural philos- 
ophy which will enable them to understand the natural. phenomena about them 
and the varied applications in modern industrial life—the pump, the steam 
engine, and the telegraph. 3 
‘The third proposition is to introduce elementary algebra at 12 or earlier. 
From thisI dissent. Elementary algebra has neither practical nor disciplinary 
value for pupils not going into the higher mathematics. Its relations are purely 
numerical, and with most pupils in the high schools its operations are chiefly ~ 
mechanical. Asa discipline it has no advantage over arithmetic. In fact, it 
has infinitely less value than the analytical processes of Warren Colburn’s first 
book. It is true children may learn early to juggle with x, and they may be 
pleased to see how nicely the ‘‘sum comes out,” but this is not algebra in any 
true sense. I have found by experience that real algebra is severe discipline 
for students from 16 to 20 who have had full high-school training. To learn to 
solve numerical problems in the easiest way is neither éke end nor an end to be 
sought with much solicitude. 
The next proposition is to introduce elementary plane geometry at an age 
not later than 13 years. By this the association doubtless meant demonstrative 
geometry of the Euclidian type. The mental discipline derived from this study 
is of great value, but such discipline can not be acquired by classes of children 
13 or younger. They can, as so many older students have done, memorize theo- 
rems and demonstrations, and recite them glibly, But this is not geometry ; it 
is only words.. The question is not whether children can be put into geometry, 
but whether geometry can be putinto them. But there is a kind of geometry 
which is already everywhere in use in the well-organized public schools, and 
which is being developed as far as the capacities of the pupils will admit. It is 
not called geometry, but industrial drawing. It is throughout a study of form, 
its properties and relations. It is form inthe concrete; it deals with geometri- 
cal relations experimentally and constructively. Its logic is inductive rather 
than deductive, and it looks directly toward the practical necessities of handi- 
craft as well as to the broader culture which is a universal need. Ee 
Coming to the proposed study of Latin and the modern languages at the age 
of 10, time will allow but brief consideration. I can not see that Latin for chil- 
dren from 10 to 14 would have advantages either for discipline or use sufficient 
to justify its introduction. All that part which exercises chiefly the memory, 
and which constitutes the drudgery of the study, could doubtless be done earlier 
 
-P-A-G-E-534
  
    1126 / EDUCATION REPORT, 1899-90. - 
than 14, but only by dint of severe labor and by much displacement of other 
studies. I can not see how the children would get beyond the drudgery and re- 
eeive any impulse from Latin as literature, nor would that nice linguistic work 
be possible on which th® value of the study as mental discipline chiefly depends. 
This has some maturity as its necessary condition.. Of modern languages, it is 
- ‘doubtless true that they can be learned colloquially more easily at 10 than at 14. 
But this argument proves too much, for they can be learned better at 6 than at 
_ 10, and better at2 than at 6. If ease of learning is the end sought they should 
- be putinto the kindergarten. To this I should assent if there were teachers 
all along the line who could continue the work; but for children who are going - 
to work at 14 it seems of doubtful utility to require or to allow them to occupy 
themselves for four years with either French or German. 
In place of these that more extended work in the literature of their own lan- 
guage which is becoming so general in the best grammar schools, of which the 
association of colleges has evidently never heard, is infinitely more yaluab!e. 
_ It has all the elements of culture for immediate purposes. It will be more likely 
_ to develop into a continuation study than any other subject, and to project 
itself into the post-school life and to influenceit for good. Speaking for myself, 
LT have no hesitation in saying that the present movement in grammar-school 
work in nature study, in drawing, in literature, and in music is sufficiently en- 
riching, is more philosophical educationally, and will prove more practically 
and generally beneficial under the direction of the public-school men who have 
originated it than the lines of work proposed by the association of colleges. 
Foreign languages in the grammar schools.—William C. Collar, Roxbury Latin 
School: That the presidents of a dozen New England colleges should unite, es 
they have lately done, in a recommendation that one or two foreign languages 
should be made a part of a regular grammar-school course, strikes me with 
astonishment. Ono would like to know whether the prodigious success that 
we have attained in the pursuit of foreign languages in our high schools 
prompted this sapient suggestion. Did they consider well the general compe- 
tency of grammar-school teachers to give such instruction? Have they weighed 
the intellectual profit to be derived from pottering a year or two with the ele- 
thents of another tongue? * 
__ Shortening and enriching the grammar-school course.—Charles W. Eliot, presi- 
dent Harvard University..—I. We may properly use the term shortening in 
either of two senses. In the first place, the number of grades may be reduced 
_ from 16 to 9 or from 9 to 8, so that the combined primary and grammar-school 
periods shall end at 14 or 18; or secondly, the studies of the present course may 
be reduced in volume or in variety, or in both, so that there shall be room for 
the introduction of new subjects. I observe that both kinds of shortening have 
actually been begun in various towns and cities, and I believe that both are de- 
sirable, if nos universally, at least in most localities. The argument for the 
first kind of shortening is a compact and convincing one—averaging the rates 
of progress of bright children with those of dull children being the great curse 
of a graded school. It is safer tomake the regular programme for 8 grades and 
lengthen it for the exceptionally slow pupils than to make it 10 grades and 
shorten it for the exceptionally quick. In other words, since holding back the 
-eapable children is‘a much greater educational injustice than hurrying the in- 
capable, the programme should be so construed as to give all possible chances 
of avoiding the greater evil. Without altering the nominal length of the pro- 
_ gramme in years, a great shortening of the course can be effected for part of the 
children simply by permitting the capable ones to do two years’ work in one. 
T heard a grammar-school master testifying a few days ago in a teachers’ meet- 
_ ing that nearly one-quarter of the pupils in his school (which numbers about 650 
children) were successfully accomplishing this double task. Such a statement 
opens a cheerful vista for one who desires to see the grammar-school course both 
shortened and enriched. 
With no more words about the first kind of shortening, I turn to the second 
kind, namely, the desirable reductions in the yolume and variety of the present 
siudies. The first great reduction should, I believe, be made in arithmetic. I 
find that it is very common in programmes.of the grades to allot to arithmetic 
from one-eighth to one-sixth of the whels school time for nine or ten years, In 
many towns and cities two arithmetics are used during these years—asmall one of 
perhaps 100 pages, followed by a larger one of 200 or 300 pages. Now, the small 
book ordinarily contains all the arithmetic that anybody needs to know; indeed,

      COURSES OF STUDY. 
much more than most of us ever use. Before a body of experts like this it were 
superfluous to enlarge on this proposition. On grounds of utility geometry and 
physics have stronger claims than any part of arithmetic beyond the elements; 
and for mental training they are also to be preferred. By the contraction of 
arithmetic, room is made for algebra and geometry. Ina few schools these sub- 
jects have already been introduced, with or without mention in the official pro- 
. grammes, and they have proved to-be interesting and intelligible to American 
children of from 11 to 13 years of age, just as they are to European children. 
Moreover, the attainments of the pupils in arithmetic are not diminished by 
the introduction of the new studies, but rather increased. The algebraic way 
of solving a problem is often more intelligible than the arithmetical, and men- 
suration. is easier when founded on a good knowledge of elementary geometry 
than it is in the lack of that foundation. The three subjects together are vastly 
moreinteresting than arithmetic alone pursued through nine consecutive years. 
Secondly, language studies, including reading, writing, spelling, grammar, and 
literature, occupy from one-third to two-fifths of most grade programmes. 
There is ample room here for the introduction of the optional study of a foreign 
language, ancient or modern, at the fourth or fifth grade. Here it is to be ob- 
served that nothing will be lost to English by the introduction of a foreign lan- 
guage. 
In many schools the subject of grammar still fills too large a place on tho pro-   
gramme, although great improvement has taken place in the treatment of this — 
abstruse subject which is so unsuitable for children. In the Beginner's Latin 
Book, by Messrs. Collar and Daniell, I noticed five years ago an excellent deserip- 
tion of the amount of knowledge of English grammar needed by apupil of 10 or12 
years of age about to begin Latin. Of course, the pupil who is not to begin Latin 
needs no more. All the grammar which the learner needed to know b-fore be- 
ginning Latin was ‘the names and functions of the parts of speech in English 
and the meanings of the common grammatical terms, such as subject and predi- 
cate, case, tense, voice, declension, conjunction,” etc. Manuals have now been 
prepared in considerable variety for imparting this limited amount of grammati- 1127 
cal information by examples and practice rather than by rules and precepts; so 
that the greater part of the time formerly spent on English grammar can now 
be saved for more profitable uses. Thirdly, geography isnow taughtfrom books 
and flat atlases chiefly as a memory study, and much time is given to committing 
to memory masses of facts which ean not be retained and which are of little value — 
if retained. By grouping physical geography with natural history, and political 
geography with history, and by providing proper apparatus for teaching geog- 
raphy, time can be saved, and yet a place made for much new and interesting 
geographical instruction. Fourthly, asmall saving of time can be made for useful 
subjects by striking outthe bookkeeping which in many townsand cities is found 
in the last grade. This subject is doubtless included in the grammar-schcol 
programme, because it is supposed to be of practical value; but I believe it to be 
the most useless subject in the entire programme, for the reason that the book- 
keeping taught is a kind of bookkeeping never found in any real business estab- 
lishment. Every large business has ‘In these days its own forms of accounting. 
and bookkeeping, which are, for the most part, peculiar to itself. Almost every 
large firm or corporation has its own methcd, with printed headings, schedules, — 
bill-heads, invoices, and duplicating order-books, adapted ¢o its own business 
and intended to simplify its accounts and reduce to lowest terms the amount of 
writing necessary to keep them. What-a boy or girl can learn at school which 
will be useful in after-life in keeping books or accounts for any real business isa — 
good handwriting, and accuracy in adding, subtracting, multiplying, and divid- 
ing small numbers. It is a positive injury to a boy to give him the impression 
that he knows something about bookkeeping when he has only learned an un- ~ 
real system which he will never find used inany actual business. At best, book- 
keeping is not ascience, but only an art based on conventions. As trade and in- 
dustry have been differentiated in the modern world, bookkeeping has been dif- 
ferentiated also, and it is, of course, impossible to teach in school the infinite 
diversities of practice. 
  IL. I have thus indicated in the briefest manner the reductions which may be 
conveniently made in some of the present subjects in order to effect a shortening 
of the present grammar-school programme. My next topic is diversifying and 
enriching it. The most complete statement of the new subjects proposed for the 
grammar-school programme is that made by,the Association of Colleges in New 
England at theirmeeting at Brown University last November. .That association 
then invited the attention of the public to certain changes in the grammar-school   
          
 
-P-A-G-E-536
    F128 > = EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Rejeranimis which it recommended for gradual adoption. These changes are 
ve in number. 
The first is the introduction of elementary natural history into the earlier 
years of the programme, to be taught by demonstrations and practical exercises 
rather than from books. The term natural history was doubtless intended to in- 
clude botany, zodlogy, geology, and physical geography. Some room for these 
subjects is already made-in most grammar-school programmes, and the recom- 
mendation of the association refers as much to methods of teaching as to time 
allotted to the subject. The association recommends that the teaching be de- 
monstrative, and thatadequate apparatus ke provided for teaching these subjects.’ 
There is a lamentable lack of the proper apparatus for teaching geography in 
the public schools. Indeed, in many schools there is no proper apparatus for 
teaching geography or any other natural-history subject to young children, 
Natural-science apparatus has been provided in some exceptional high schools, 
but as a rule grammar schools are still destitute in this important respect. 
The second recommendation is the introduction of elementary physics into 
the later years of the programme, to be taught by the laboratory method and to 
include exact weighing and measuring by the pupils themselves. 
The third and fourth recommendations cover the introduction of algebra and 
geometry at the age of 12 or 13. 
The fifth is the offering of opportunity to study French or German or Latin 
or any two of these languages from and after the age of 10. 
III. Such are, in brief, the proposals for shortening and enriching the gram- 
mar-school course. I want to use the rest of the time allotted to me in discuss- 
‘ing the objections to these various changes. 
The first objection I take up is the objection to a reduction in the time de- 
voted to arithmetic. Many teachers are shocked at the bare idea of reducing 
the time given to arithmetic, because they believe that arithmetic affords a pe- 
culiarly valuable training, first, in reasoning, and secondly, in precision of 
thought and accuracy of work. They perceive that the greater part of the 
school progamme calls only for memorizing power and they think that arith- 
metic develops reasoning power. The fact is, however, that mathematical rea- 
soning is a peculiar form of logic which has very little application to commen 
life and no application at all in those great fields of human activity where per- 
fect demonstration is not to be Obtained. Asarule, neither the biological nor * 
the moral sciences can make use of mathematical reasoning. Moreover, so far 
-as mathematical reasoning is itself concerned, variety of subject is very useful 
to the pupils. The substitution of algebra and geometry for part of the arith- 
metic is a clear gain to the pupil so far as acquaintance with the logic of mathe- 
matics goes. Again, practice in thinking with accuracy and working with dem- 
onstrable precision can be obtained in algebra, geometry, and physics just as 
well as in arithmetic. Itis quite unnecessary to adhere to the lowest and least _ 
interesting of these exact subjects in order to secure adequate practice in preci- 
- sion of thought and work. ° 
- The second objection is that there are children in the grammar'schools who 
are incapable of pursuing these new subjects. Assuming that this allegation is 
true of some children, I have to remark, first, that we shall not know till we 
have tried what proportion of children are incapable of pursuing algebra, ge- 
ometry, physics, and some foreign language by the time they are 14 years of age. 
It is a curious fact that we Americans habitually underestimate the capacity of 
pupils at almost every stage of education, from the primary school through the 
university. The expectation of- attainment for the American child or for the 
American college student is much lower than the expectation of attainment for 
the European. This error has been very grave in its effects on American edu- 
cation all along the line, from the primary school through the university, and 
till within twenty years the effects were nowhere worse than at the college grade. 
It seems to me probable that the proportion of grammar-school children inca- 
le of pursuing geometry, algebra, and a foreign language would turn out to 
much smaller than we now imagiue, but though this proportion should be 
large it would not justify the exclusion of all the capable children from oppor- 
tunities which they could profit by. At the worst this objection can only go to 
show that it will be necessary to adopt in the grammar schools a flexible instead 
of arigid system—some selection or choice of studies instead of a uniform re- 
quirement. Those children who are competent to study 4 foreign language 
should certainly have the opportunity of doing so at the proper age, that is, not 
later than 10 or 11 years; and those who are competent to begin geometry 
at 12 and algebra at 13 should have the chance, If experience shall prove that 
     
-P-A-G-E-537
  ergo 3 ass ” 
  “COURSES OF STUDY. 1129 
a considerable proportion of grammar-school children are incapable of pursuing 
the higher studies that fact will only show that the selection of appropriate 
studies for children by their teachers should be adopted as_a policy by the pub- 
lic grammar school. To discriminate between pupils of different. capacity, to 
select the competent for suitable instruction, and to advance each pupil with 
appropriate rapidity will ultimately become, I believe, the most important func- 
tions of the public-school administrator—those functions in which he or she will © é 
be most serviceable to families and to the state. 
Another objection to the changes proposed often takes this form—they are 
said to be aristocratic in tendency. The democratic theory, itis said, implies 
equality among the children, uniformity of programme, uniform tests for pro- 
motion, and no divisions in the same schoolroom according to capacity or merit. 
I need not say to this audience that these conceptions of true democracy in 
schools are fallacious and ruinous. Democratic society does not undertake to 
fly in the face of nature by asserting that all children are equal in capacity or 
that all children are alike and should be treated alike. Hverybody knows that 
children are infinitely diverse; that children in the same family even are apt 
to be very different in disposition, temperament, and mental power. Every 
child is a unique personality. It follows, of course, that uniform programmes 
and uniform methods of instruction, applied simultaneously to large numbers of 
children, must be unwise and injurious—an evil always to be struggled against 
and reformed, so far as the material resources of democratic society will permit. 
It is for the interest of society, as well as of the individual, that every individ- 
ual child’s peculiar gifts and powers should be developed and trained to the 
highest degree. Hence in the public schools of a democracy the aim should ge 
to give the utmost possible amount of individual instruction, to grade accord- 
ing to capacity just as far as the number of teachers and their strength and 
skill will permit, and to promote pupils not by battalions, but in the most irreg- 
ular and individual way possible. A few days ago I heard an assistant superin-- 
tendent in an important city declare that many grammar-school teachers in his 
city objected to any division among the fifty or more pupils in each recom; 
any division, that is, according to the attainments and powers of the individual 
pupils. They wanted all the pupils in a given room to be in one grade, to move 
together like soldiers on parade, and to arrive at examination day having all 
performed precisely the same tasks and made the same progress in the same 
subjects. If that were a true portrait of the city graded school it would be safe — : 
to predict that the urban public school would before long become nothing but a 
charity school for the children of the dependent classes. Intelligent Americans: 
will not subject their children to such discipline when they once understand 
what it means. The country district sthool, in Which amofig forty or fifty pu- 
pils there are always ten or a dozen distinct classes at different stages and ad- 
vancing at different rates of progress, would remain as the only promising type 
of the free school. . Not only is it no serious objection to the new proposals that 
they must diminish uniformity in schools—it is their strongest recommendation. ~ 
So far from the changes proposed being of aristocratic tendency, they are 
really essential to a truly democratic school system; for they must be adopted 
and carried into effect before the children of the poor can obtain equal access 
with the children of the rich to the best education they are capable of, whatever 
the grade of that education may be. Accessibility of appropriate opportunity 
is the essence of democratic society ; not equality of gifts, attainments, or powers, 
for that equality is unnatural and impossible; not abundance of inappropriate 
opportunities, for such abundance is of no avail ; but accessibility of such appro- 
priate opportunities as the individual can utilize for his own benefit and that of 
society. The American grammar-school programme now actually prevents an 
intelligent child from beginning the study of a foreign tongue at the right age. 
We all know that that age is very early, long before the high-school period. it 
prevents him from beginning the study of algebra and geometry at the right age. 
it makes it impossible for him to get a chance at the right kind of study of nat- 
ural science. If a boy is not to go to the high school, he loses that chance for- 
ever under our present system. If he is going to the high school he does not 
get the chance till much too late. The poor boy in the United States should have - 
as good a chance as the child of a rich man to obtain the best school training 
which his character and powers fit him to receive. 
Is not that a fair statement of what democratic society may reasonably aim 
atand seek to effect throughits owngrammar schools? Yet the existing gram- 
mar-school programme actually prevents the poor boy from getting that chance. 
The rich man can obtain for his children a suitably varied course of instruction, 
     
-P-A-G-E-538
   1130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1839-20. 
with much individual teaching,in a private or endowed school; but the im- 
‘mense majority of American children are confined to the limited, uniform, ma- 
chine programme of the graded grammar school. A demccratic society was 
never more misled as to its own interest than in supposing such a programme to 
be for the interest of the masses. The grades for pupils from 6 to 15 years of 
of age are an obstruction to the rise through democratic society of the children 
who ought to rise. Uniformity is the curse of American schools. That any 
school or college has a uniform product should be regarded as a demonstration 
_of inferiority—of incapacity to meet the legitimate demands of a social order 
whose fundamental principle is that every career should b2 open to talent. Se- 
lection of studies for the individual, instruction addressed to the individual, ir- 
regular promotion, grading by natural capacity and rapidity of attainment, and 
diversity of product as regards age and acquisitions must come to characterize 
the Ameriean public school if it is to answer the purposes of a democratic so- 
ciety. 
Pourth. It is further alleged that the changes proposed are chiefly for the ad- - 
yantage of the well-to-do children whose education is to be carried beyond the 
grammar school to the high school, and possibly to the college above the high 
school. They are indeed for the interest of this class of children; but they are 
more for the interest of the children who are not going to the high school, and 
- for whom therefore the grammar school is to provide all the systematic educa- 
tion they will ever receive. The Association of Colleges in New England dis- 
tinctly says that it males its recommendations in the interest of the public- 
school system as a whole; ‘‘but most of them are offered more particularly in 
_ the interest of those children whose education is not tobe continued beyond the 
grammar school.” Take, for example,the subject of geometry. It has many 
and very important applications in the arts and trades. Every mechanic needs 
some knowledge of it. Its applications are as important as those of arithmetic, 
if we except the very simplest and commonest arithmetical operations. That 
the great mass of American children should leave school without eVer having 
touched this subject, except perhaps in arithmetic under the head of mensura- 
tion, is a grave misfortune. To introduce variety into the grammar-school pro- 
gramme is in itself likely to profit the children who are never to go to school 
- afier they are 14 years of age even more than the children who are. A child 
who is dull in one subject may be bright in a different subject. Thus a child 
who has no gift in language may be keen and quick in natural-history studies. 
A child who has no tasts for arithmetic may prove unusually strong in geom- 
etry. One whose mind is not easily moved through purely mental exercises 
may be intellectually developed through drawing and manuai training. In col- 
lege we are extremely familiar with these diversities, and the elective system is 
now giving in most American colleges free play for the profitable exhibition and 
_ cultivation of these diverse gifts. In asimilar manner the grammar school will 
be better for even the dull and slow children if its studies are made more vari- 
ous and its whole system more flexible. 
A fifth objection to the introduction of new subjects is that children are al- 
- ready overworked in school. In an address which I gaye rather more than a 
year ago I pointed out that there are two effective mechanieal precautions against 
the ill effects attributed to overwork at school, precautions which it is delight- 
ful to see are more and more adopted. They are good ventilation and the sys- 
_ tematieuse of light gymnastics at recularintervalsduring school hours. School 
time ought to be the best managed of al! the day from a sanitary point of view, 
excepting these hours which the children pass out of doors. If the schoolroom 
were invariably healthier in every respect. than the average home we should 
hear less about overworkatschool. Thereis, however, a third precaution against      
  overwork which is quite as important as either of those already mentioned ; it : 
is making the school work interesting to the children. Four years ago I asked 
the attention of this department of the National Educational Association to the 
depressing effect which lack of interest and conscious progress in school work 
has upon children. To introduce new and higher subjects into the school pro- 
gramme is not necessarily to increase the strain.upon the child. If this meas- 
ure increases the interest and attractiveness of the work and the sense of achieve- 
ment it will diminish weariness and the risk of hurtful strain. 
Lastly, there is an apprehension lest the introduction of the new subjects rec- 
ommended should inerease existing difficulties with regard to promotion. Pa- 
rents are sensitive about the promotion of theirchildren. They wantthe dull ones 
and the bright to be promoted at the same rate. Their sympathies are quite as 
_apt to be. with the siow children as with the quick. I believe that this practical

difficulty should be met in part by the abandonment of uniform attainment or of” 
a standard of required knowledge as ground of promotion. In Harvard College, 
where there is no such thing as a uniform programme of study for all students, — 
and where, indeed, there is small chance that any 2 students out of 1,450 will 
pursue the same course of studies during their four years of residence, we have 
‘ long since abandoned uniform attainment as ground of promotion from one class 
to another. The cole ground of promotion is reasonable fidelity. I venture to 
believe that this is the true ground of promotion in grammar schools as well, 
and that by the sole use of this principle in promoting the difficulty now under 
consideration would be much alleviated, if not done away with. The right time 
for advancing a child to the study of a new subject is the first moment he is 
capable of comprehending it. All our divisions of the total school period into 
years, and into primary, grammar, and high schools, are artificial and in most 
cases hurtful or hindering to the individual. The whole school life should be 
- one unbroken flow from one fresh interest and one new delight to another, and 
the rate of that flow ought to be different for each different child. Economical 
schcol administration inevitably interferes somewhat with the desirable con- _ 
tinuity and variety of motion, but the most skilful and wisest administration is _ 
that which interferes least. 
On reviewing the progress of this reform since I had the honor of discussing 
the question, ‘* Can school programmes be shortened and enriched ?” before this 
department of superintendence four years ago, I see many evidences that a great 
and beneficent change in public-school programmes is rapidly advancing. The 
best evidence is to be found in the keen interest which superintendents and 
teachers take in the discussion of the subject. Through them the proposed im- 
provements will be wrought out in detail, their influence will be successfully. 
exerted on parents, committees, and the public press; and their reward will be, 
/ first, the daily sight of happier and better-trained children, and secendly, the 
elevation of their own profession. 
Algebra and geometry in grammar schools—President Eliot criticisedl.—Fkdward 
Brooks, LL. D., superintendent of schools, Philadelphia’: The programme for 
“eight grades,” as recommended by President Eliot, is almost universally 
adopted in our graded schools. In Philadelphia pupilsenter the primary schools ~ 
at 6 years of age, and have an eight years’ course to complete the grammar 
schools. Very bright pupils are allowed to do it in less time. The same thing 
is generally true of the cities of the country; very few have anine years’ course ; 
almost none a ten years’ course. His suggestion of combining studies has also 
been adopted in many of our public schools. With primary grades it is a very 
common practice to unite geography and history, and with more advanced grades 
political and physical geography have usually been taught together for many 
years. 
I doubt very much whether there is any advantage to be derived from the in- 
troduction of algebra into the grammar-school course. To the ordinary citizen’ 
in practical life a knowledge of algebra will be found of little value. No one 
buys or sells by algebra; and a knowledge of polynomials or the quadratic equa- 
tion would be of little use to the housewife in the discharge of her duties. In- 
deed, no one of the mathematical branches would be of so little value in the ordi- | ~ 
nary practical affairs of life as algebra. Besides, we can not advocate the study 
of algebra on account of its disciplinary value, for no mathematical branch gives 
so little mental discipline that the ordinary business or professional man would 
find of use. As a disciplinary study the elements of algebra will be found to be 
far inferior to either arithmetic or geométry. Much of algebra is a mere cal- 
culus, and the aim of the student is to become expert with the manipulation of 
symbols, a form of.mental operation entirely removed from that of ordinary life. 
In place of algebra I would urge a more general introduction of arithmetical 
analysis, usually known as mentalarithmetic. This form of reasoning, originat- 
ing with Warren Colburn, is better adapted to sharpen and strengthen the ana- 
lytical powers of young students than any other branch of the grammar-school 
eurriculum. It is far superior to algebra in developing the thought power of the 
student. It is also generally simpler and shorter in its methods of reasoning 
and operation thanalgebra. Take the problem that President Eliot gives, ‘‘ The 
sum’ of 2 numbers is 24, and one is twice the other.” I can obtain the results by 
the simple process of arithmetical analysis before the algebraist could write his 
equations. A problem like the following: ‘‘If A can do a piece of work in four 
days and B in six days, in what time can both do it?” is much more simply COURSES OF STUDY.

worked by arithmetical analysis than by algebra. And the same is true of a. 
largenumbc> of problems. I urge, therefore, in place of algebra, that the beau- 
tiful system of acthinetinal thought known as mental arithmetic be more fully 
introduced into our grammar schools than it is to-day. 
The study of geometry as a science should notbe introduced into our grammar 
schools. Concrete and practical geometry isalready taught in most of our gram- 
“mar schools under the head of drawing and mensuration. In most of these 
schools the pupils are made familiar with all the ordinary geometrical figures 
and their properties or principles. These principles include the methods of ob- 
taining the areas of plane surfaces, the areaand circumference of the circle, and 
the surface and volume of the parallelopiped, pyramid, cylinder, cone, and 
sphere. These principles are obtained, not: by cemnone nA Cn but by concrete 
illustration, and they are applied by the chi dren tte are familiar with 
them. Thisisall thatitis practicable todo wit! ac the grammar schools. 
_ ‘fhe pupils are not prepared for the logical processes at abstract geometry and 
eannotunderstand them. 'The method of reasoning from axioms and established 
principles by the logical methods of geometry is too difficult for the ordinary 
student of the grammar schools. It is said that abstract geometry, with its 
demonstrations, is taught in the public schools of Germany and France; but in 
my examination last summer of the elementary schools of Paris corresponding 
to our grammar schools I did notfind a single pupil studying the science of ge- 
ometry. They apply the princip!es reached eoncreselys as we do in our gram- 
mar schools. 
That the work of the grammar schools can be improved by shortening the 
. course of study is a proposition that necds demonstration. That it may be en- 
vichecd is a most desirable object, though it is a question whether this enrich- 
‘ment may not be attained by other means than the addition to or subtraction 
from the present course of studies. The broader question is, how shall the best 
results of culture and knowledge be attained in our grammar schools? The ob- 
ject can be attained by having a correct course of study, as rich in materials for 
intellectual, moral, and spiritual culture as is possible, and by having well- 
eancd. and skillful teachers to use this course of instruction to the best advan- 
tage. 
Those German and French schools.—John T. Prince, agent Massachusetts board 
of education: President Eliot is clearly wrong in his impression of what is 
done in the elementary schools of France and Germany. Algebra and geom- 
etry are not in the schools that compare in any regard with our grammar grades. 
Algebra nowhere precedes geometry. The geometry taught is not demonstra- 
tive, but is more like that taughtin the grammar and even in the primary grades 
here. The colloquial speaking of the Romance languages has no such value as 
these later reformers would place upon it. The whole difficulty lies in the fact 
that the grammar schools of Europeand Americaare compared by men who have 
not studied either. 
The two ideals of the course of study.—W. T. Harris, commissioner: In the 
schools of the United States-there prevail two- different ideals of the course of 
study; the one originating with the directors of higher education and the other 
a growth from the common elementary school. These two ideals clash in quite 
_important particulars. The common-school course of study, as it appears in the 
elementary sohool and in the public high school which gives secondary instruc- 
tion, does not shape itself so as to fit its pupils for entrance to the colleges. At 
least, if we admit that as an actual fact many high-school pupils do enter 
college, we must also admit that there is a constant tendency in the pub ic high 
school to diverge in its course of study and follow a path that does not lead to 
the college. 
The older colleges of the States, following the traditions brought over from 
Europe, built their course of study on mathematics and the classical languages, 
Latin and Greek. They accordingly demanded of the preparatory schools a 
preliminary training or preparation.along these lines and neglected all else. 
Human learning ab one period did not include much that was not conceived 
and expressed in Latin or Greek words. But within the past 300 years there has 
arisen a modern tributary stream of human learning, and it has some time since 
begun its demand for recognition in the course of study. This modern side of 
human learning includes the natural sciences and modern literature. These two 
contingents are almost wholly the products of the past 300 years. 
The demands of the sciences and the demands of the literature of the modern 
lang. uages to a share in the course of study were met in one way by the college     
   
-P-A-G-E-541
  COURSES OF STUDY. 
and in another way by the common school. ‘The directors of higher education 
affirmed that Latin, Greek, and. mathematics furnished the truly disciplinary 
studies fit for the foundation of allliteral education. Modern literature and the 
sciences on the other hand were not and.could not become culture studies, al- 
though they might be useful in the way of accomplishments in practical life. 
Accordingly, the colleges proceeded to recognize the moderns by admitting 
them into the course of study at the end. During the fourth or senior year of 
    college the student was given a rapid survey of the sciences and of some of the — 
great works of modern literary art. But the college did not encourage the in- 
troduction of modern literature and natural science into the preparatory school. 
Consequently the pupil who left school during his preparatory course or before 
the senior year of college found himself ignorant of these two great and rapidly 
growing provinces of human learning. 
But the public-school system has taken a differentdirection in the matter. It 
has been under the supervision and management of less highly educated men— 
that is to say, of men less thoroughly instructed in the forms of the past, and as 
a result less conservative. When the moderns appealed for a place in the course 
of study some concession was at once made to the demand. A tendency has 
been established to recognize the moderns throughout the course of study. First, 
modern literature was admitted in the shape of a graded series of school readers 
containing many of the gems of Englishand American literature, and much, too, 
that was written in mere colloquial English, and much that was trashy in its 
style and thought. 
In the geographical text-book there was an attempt at a survey of the phys- 
ical world in its relations to man, the world in its mathematical features of 
size, shape, and motions, in its physical aspects of interacting forces of light, 
heat, moisture, and gravitation, and, finally, in its biological aspects of plant 
life, animal life, and the races of men. 
This geographical text-book also drew on the social sciences and introduced 
scraps of information regarding political economy, the occupations of men, and. 
also the political institutions, the laws and customs and religion. Geography 
has therefore developed from the beginning into a sort of compend of natural 
sciences, affording the pupil a survey of the results of the modern sciences, 
*both in the physical and social world. 
Having conceded to the demands of the moderns in the elementary school in 
these respects and in the introduction of a history of the fatherland, it re- 
mained next to emphasize this tendency still more in the secondary public 
school, and to make the high-school course of study include more thorough 
work in English literature, universal history, three or four selected sciences 
like geology, astronomy, physiology, and chemistry, in addition to the math- 
ematics and some modern or ancient language. 
It might be claimed that the graduates of the high school had a broader edu- 
cation; his education, under good teachers, might even be thorough, but cer- 
tainly in his preparation in Latin and Greek the amount was not sufficient to 
give the high-school pupil a fair chance by the side of the graduate of the 
special preparatory school. 
The directors of the common schools have therefore been compelled to estab- 
lish a double course, a classical and an English course, in the public high school, 
a procedure so foreign to the spirit of the entire common-school course of study 
that it has only partially succeeded. 
Adapt the high schools to the colleges.—Superintendent N. C. Dougherty, of Peo- — 
ria, [ll.: What could be more natural than that the higher should reach down 
and adapt the lower to itself? The high schools are here to stay. If the edu- 
cation given by them in the past is not in all respects just what is needed, let us 
improve upon it. Let us make it better and better, as the years go by, until it 
shall supply just what is needed. Let us remember that we do the best for the 
boy who stops with a high-school education when we do nothing to impede the 
progress of the other boy who goes on to a college graduation. é 
The specific problem at the present time.—Nicholas Murray Butler: The marked- 
difference at the present time between the general educational organization in 
this country and in Europe is to be found in the fact that in Europe the elemen- 
tary school is not as arule in complete codrdination with the secondary school 
and the university; while in the United States the connection between the ele- 
mentay and the secondary school is complete, but that between the secondary 
school and the university is wanting. Therefore the specific problem in edu- 
cational organization that the American people have to deal with at the pr-sent 
 
-P-A-G-E-542
1134 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. nee 
  time is the codrdinating of the secondary and the superior instruction. This 
will be done by the high schools, the academies, and the colleges. In this or- 
ganization the American college will always continue to occupy a prominent 
place. * * * The college should rest upon the high school, and should not 
raise its requirements for admission to such an extent that high school graduates 
may not pass easily and naturally into it. The contemporary demand for a 
shortening of the time devoted to obtaining both a college and a professional 
education is a sound one, and must be heeded. Theshortening, however, should 
not take place at the expense of residence in coliege. That is in many ways the 
most valuable feature of American higher education. It ean not be sacrificed 
without gravest loss. The problem can best be met by welding the college and 
the professional school together, and admitting certain preliminary professional 
studies, as electives, into the course leading to the degree of bachelor of arts. 
Shortening the preparatory course.—President H. E. Webster, of Union College 
(N. Y.): Nothing ean be better established than that the colleges are entirely 
_ dependent on the secondary schools for their support and success. If the schools 
are weak, inefficient, the college that draws from them can not have a high 
_ standard. The eastern colleges have been for many years demanding more and 
more of the preparatory schools. The requirements for admission to college have 
been increased; the age of graduation for the average student is much greater 
- than it was in the past. Meantime, competition for places in life has become 
_ sharper than ever. And now the cry goes out, college graduates are too old; 
- the course must be shortened; men must get into life earlier. And so they 
ought. But if a change is to be made, let it be in the requirements for admis- 
sion to college, not in the length of the college course. Any college man will 
maintain that college life is worth more to a young man than life ina preparatory 
school, no matter how well conducted. Asit seems to me, no greater mistake 
can be made than to shorten the college course. This, of course, for the aver- 
ageman. Every college course is arranged for the average man. The excep- 
tional man—let him graduate whenever he has done his work. 
There is one great trouble with the highschools. They are doing much of the 
_ work that ought to be done in colleges, and for this they have good grounds. 
- Only a small number of students in high schcols expect or intend to enter col- 
lege. It is well that those who can not enter any higher institution of learning 
should receive instruction in many branches which properly belong in the col- 
lege course. Butin every such school there ought to be a course arranged for 
young men and women who do intend to ‘‘go up higher.” The time of prepara- 
- tion would then be much shortened, beeause many subjects would be omitted. 
This would encourage students to go on with their education. For many years I 
was a teacher of natural science in various colleges. Isay without hesitation 
- that better work can be done (in colleges) with a student who comes fresh to the 
subject than with one who through his high-school training thinks that he un- 
derstands the subject. I conclude in this wise : 
In our high schools the teaching is excellent. All honor to thos2 who give 
their lives to it. But there ought to be preparatory courses for colleges, includ- 
ing only such subjects as are required for admission in colleges. 
That if any change is to be made so as toshorten the time for college students, 
it should be made in the preparatory course. 
There comes a ‘‘ moment of instinctive readiness” for every subject of study.—Wil- 
liam James, professor, Harvard University: In all pedagogy the great thing is 
to strike the iron while hot and to seize the wave of the pupil’s interest in each 
successive subject before its ebb has come, so that knowedge may be got and a 
habit of skill acquired—a headway of interest, in short, secured on which after- 
ward the individual may float. There is a happy moment for fixing skill in 
drawing, for making boys collectors in natural eee. and presently dissectors 
and botanists; then for initiating them into the harmonies of mechanics and the 
wonders of physical and chemical law. Later, introspective psychology and the 
metaphysical and religious mysteries take their turn; and, last ofall, the drama 
of human affairs and worldly wisdom in the widest sense of the term. In each 
of us a saturation point is soon reached in all these things; the impetus of our 
purely intellectual zeal expires, and unless the topic be one associated with some 
urgent personal need that keeps our wits constantly whetted about it, we settle 
into an equilibrium, and live on what we learned when our interest was fresh 
and instinctive without adding to the store. Outside of their own business the 
ideas gained by men before they are twenty-five ara practically the only ideas 
they shall have in their lives. They can not get anything new. Disinterested 
curiosity is past, the mental grooves and channels set, the power of assimilation

        157 
“gone. If by chance we ever do learn anything about some entirely new topic 
we are afflicted with a strange sense of insecurity and we fear to advance 4 reso- 
lute opinion. But with thingslearned in the plastic days of instructive curiosity 
we never lose entirely our sense of being at home. There remains a kinship, a eee et - = EDUCATION. 
- sentiment of intimate acquaintances, which, even when we know we have failed 
to keep abreast of the subject, flatters us with a sense of power overitand makes ~ 
us feel not altogether out of the pale. Whatever individual exceptions. to this 
might be cited are of the sort that ‘‘ prove the rule.” 
‘To detect the moment of the instinctive readiness for the subject is, then, the 
first duty of every educator. As for the pupils, it would probably lead to amore 
earnest temper on the part of college students if they had less belief in their 
unlimited future intellectual potentialities, and could be brought to realize that 
whatever physics and political economy and philosophy they are now acquiring 
are, for better or worse, the physics and political economy and philosophy that 
will have to. serve them to the end. z 2 
Modern studies may furnish a liberal education —J. E. C. Welldon, head master 
Harrow School, England (in the Academy): Speaking generally, with the ex- 
perience of a school in which a modern education has been tried on a large 
seale, I may give it as my clear opinion that the boys who have been educated. 
in modern subjects deserve to be accredited with a liberal education in the same 
sense and to the same extent as other boys. In their intellectual character- 
istics, so far as I can estimate them, they are not altogether like the classical 
boys; but they are not inferior. * * * They are, in many instances, hoys of. 
keen and active intelligence. In the range of their culture and the discipline 
of their mental powers they are the equals of boys who have received a classical 
education ; in the intellectual interest which they feel in their studies they are 
not infrequently superior. They win their share of the prizes and distinctions 
which are accorded to intellectual merit in public schools, [If it is necessary to 
mention one particular point in which they sometimes fall below their classical 
rivals it may be said to be the habit of accuracy, of perseverance, and of sus- 
tained and coneentrated attention to a subject which is not at once interesting © 
and attractive and demands a large amount of patient, painstaking effort if it is 
to be effectively pursued. 
Flexibility in courses of study—F. W. Parker, Cook County Normal Scheol: A 
course of study is an arrangement of topics and subjects in the line of develop- 
ment. Itshows the teachers the direction of work and is a general guide in 
the preparation of lessons. A course of study should be adapted to the abilities 
of tsachers. An ironclad course of study that demands compliances in every 
detail is a dire means of compelling uniformity. The differing circumstances 
of pupils demand flexibility in the adaptation of a courseofstudy. Aclass badly 
taught through several grades can not be made to follow a course of study with- 
out disastrous results. A course of study should be under constant discussion 
and shania be changed when necessary. It should aid teachers in doing their 
best work.   
IV.—EDUCATION. 
Edueation should be adapted to individual requirements—Influence of heredity and — 
environment.—President D. C. Gilman (Johns Hopkins), in the Cosmopolitan Mag- 
azine: Every boy differs from every other doy in character as he does in ap- 
pearance. Hven twins, while they closely resemble one another in many re- 
spects, may differ essentially in fundamental tastes and talents. Mr. Grafton 
says that extreme similarity and extreme dissimilarity are nearly as common 
between twins of the same sex as moderate resemblance. If this is confirmed, 
what becomes of heredity ? : 
The corollary is obvious that plans of education should as far as possible be 
adapted to individual requirements; but as every boy is preparing for life 
among his fellows, and as Providence has so ordered it that he is strongly in- 
fluenced by other boys, it follows that to treat him alone, away from comrades, 
in the backwoods, in a cell, under exclusive instruction, isonly justifiable under 
extraordinary circumstances. He comes into the world not only as an individ- 
ual with his own responsibilities and possibilities, but as one of a family, a 
neighborhood, a race, from which he can not be extricated except by death. 
Isolation is therefore as unnatural-as it is undesirable and difficult. 
  Every boy is influenced both by his inheritance and his environment; yet, 
tho laws of heredity in the human species are not well enough known to give 
      
-P-A-G-E-544
  1136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  us any certain indications of what the child of any parents will become, while 
the conditions in which a person lives are as complex as the elements that 
- nourish his body, the air he breathes, the water he drinks; as subtle and insin-* 
_ wating as the tones of the voice, the glance of the eye, the nod of the head, the 
pressure of the hand; as influential as religious faith, the forms of civil gov- 
ernment, the habits of society, the lessons of antiquity, the examples of good 
men; and as trifling as a careless word, a thoughtless joke, a timely hint, a 
friendly warning, or a loving smile. 
Seeking wisdom rather than knowledge.—Prof. C. A. Collin (in the University 
Magazine): The student undergoing the process of liberal education ought to 
pursue some studies in which he can not see any practical utility. His soul 
should grow and expand under the influence of quiet and unforced reflection and 
meditatioMwhich has no reference and in which he can see no reference to bread 
and butter.. In this overpractical age the student’s mind sometimes needs to be 
forcibly turned away from the pursuit of the practically useful to the cultivation 
of higher wisdom of greater value than is included within the range of what is 
ordinarily denominated practical. There is a certain influence from the study 
of Greek for which there is no equivalent. In every college or university there 
should be at least a small body of teachersand disciples to whom the life ismore 
than meat, who are seeking wisdom rather than knowledge, and who, from the 
"pursuits of philosophy, the reverence of the Lord, and the culture of the soul, 
_ gain the breadth of view, the clearness of vision, the warmth of heart, and the 
* soundness of judgment which make the strong man; and who despise the mere 
keenness and agility of intellect which makes men shrewd and smart. There is 
no danger that men taking such courses of liberal education will be too numerous. 
By all means encourage every man who can take such a course and has the soul 
' capable of receiving it to do so, whether afterwards he is to pursue a profes- 
sional or a business career. 
The bearing of heredity upon education.—Philadelphia Ledger: One of the most 
important truths which science has disclosed to us, and one which is replete 
with suggestions as to the conduct of life, is that of heredity. Instead of con- 
ceiving, as some have done, that each child came into the world like a blank 
sheet of paper, on which could be inscribed at will whatever characters we chose 
to imprint, we now know that he is a reproduction of past generations—the re- 
sult of many combinations of character, with certain aptitudes, tastes, powers, 
faculties, and tendencies derived from his various ancestors. Just as some of 
‘his features are said to resemble father or mother, or more distant relatives, 
and some are combinations of several, so in his character will be represented 
- certain qualities of one or of another, and often a mingling of many, which 
together produce an individuality all his own, yet gathered from past sources. 
It may be thought that if this be so there can not be much left for us to do. 
If each child is to reproduce the past in various forms, and under laws over 
which we can have no control, how can we hope to alter, by our interfer- 
ence, what is so irrevocably settled? How can we trace fresh characters on 
tablets already so full of permanent inscriptions? If heredity were the only 
element in the building of humanity, there might be force in such an inquiry ; 
but this is not the case. Prof. Bradford, in the last number of the Educational 
Review, says: ‘‘ Evolution works by two factors, namely, heredity, or that which 
tends to permanency, and environment, or that which tends to variation. The 
characteristic of the first is that itfeproduces the past; of the second, that it 
adapts to new conditions that which has come from the past.” This nature, so 
wonderfully complex, and so faithfully bearing within it the records of the past, 
-is yet responsive to every touch from without. The environment or surround- 
ings of the child or man always exert a potent sway over him. The influence 
of the air and the sunshine, of the climate, of town or country, of wealth or pov- 
erty, of civilization or barbarism, of care or neglect, of affection or indifference, 
of everything external, in fact, with which he comes in contact, is momentarily 
molding him into new forms, and modifying in various ways the nature which 
he has derived from the past. 
Some of these influences are beyond our control, but many of them are within 
our power, and it is on this well-grounded truth that all our efforts at training, 
education, and self-culture should be based. Many of our failures in these at- 
tempts come from not bearing constantly in mind these two elements in every 
life. Every intelligent workman must have some appreciation of the materials 
with which he works, He must know what can and what can not be done with 
them if his skill is to be effective., To deal with them all alike and to expect

EDUCATION, 
mest ordinary laborer as an utter absurdity. Yet in the infinitely more intri- 
cate and complex nature of man, where no two minds or hearts or dispositions 
are exactly similar, how common it is to apply the same methods, to urge the 
same motives, to exert the same influences, to use the same drill, and then to be 
utterly astonished that the same results do not supervene. If the builder gave 
no more attention to the different varieties of wood than we give to the varieties 
in human nature we should justly deem him incompetent and untrustworthy. 
It is for this reason, far more than for any curious research, that the great prin- 
ciple of heredity should be studied in its manifold bearings by those who aim to 
train children, to influence men, or to improve themselves. If it is true, it is 
full of meaning to us all. It suggests that if we would make impressions, or 
form habits, or instill virtues, or correct faults, we must know something of the 
nature we thus attempt to influence. What may be effectual in one instance 
may be powerless in another and ruinous in a third, for the needs are as varied 
asthe natures. It is because that which the individual inherits from past ages, 
while ineradicable, is yet being constantly modified by what comes to him from 
without, and because these two forces are always codperative that he who would 
direct the one must understand the other. If it be said that this view fills the 
whole subject of education with difficulty, it can not be denied. Butif it isa 
real and honest difficulty, who would bury it out of sight? Must it not be faced ~ 
courageously and grappled with earnestly? The possible has always sprung 
out of what seemed at first impossible, and this is no exception. So far from 
producing discouragement, it opens up new fields for thought and for work, 
which afford the richest promises for future harvests. 
The true ideal of education.—President O. D. Smith, of the Alabama Educa- 
tional Association: The highest end of education is not the advantage of the 
power it gives a man for his own selfish uses or gratification, but it is to enable 
him to discharge the immutable obligations laid on him by his position in the 
world, by his relation to God and his fellow-man in all complex relations and 
activities of life. He who pursues knowledge solely for the sake of knowledge 
is little better than he who pursues money for the sake of money. 
In our ideal of education and in our processes of working to that ideal we must 
not ignore the individuality of the pupil, his special talents and aptitudes. 
For his success and usefulness in life will be in working in fields of labor indi- 
cated by these special endowments. Therefore in his education those subjects 
should be selected as instruments of discipline and drill which will best develop 
them. Why waste time and effort to make a musician of one who has little mu- 
sical talent or a mathematician of one who has no aptitude for mathematics? 
There is no Procrustean mold by which mind may be fashioned like castings in 
afoundry. It is not to be beaten, like iron, into a desired form by sledge-hammer 
blows of drill. Let the teacher also remember he can not create a faculty, or a 
power, or an aptitude that does not exist. Rather let the teacher direct his 
efforts to the development of those powers and faculties that respond most 
readily to discipline and drill in a vigorous growth and give promise of most 
fruitful results. This principle is being recognized in our educational institu- 
tions by wider latitude of selection in elective studies and in the differentiation 
of courses. 
But in'the selection of courses of study we should always be guided and limited 
by the true ideal of growth and development, and not sacrifice it to the mere 
acquisition of knowledge, however desirable: Let the teacher never forget that 
in real education we seek for results in the man himself. The object of disci- 
plinary mental training is not to amass knowledge, but to enlarge, strengthen, 
and sharpen the mental powers. 2 
While education and the acquisition of knowledge are generally coincident, 
they are by no means necessarily identical. It is a fact of common experience 
that a man may be educated in the true sense of the term without having ac- 
quired much knowledge. In fact, the amount of knowledge of any subject one 
can acquiré at school is necessarily limited. So on the other hand a man may 
be a walking encyclopedia and yet have but little education, because such a man 
oan not transmuie his knowledge into power, into dynamic intellectual and moral 
orce. 
The question the busy, bustling, rustling world asks is not, How much does a 
man know ? but, Whatishe? Every avocation and profession has a place for the 
man that is most, not the man that knows most. It isa matter of comparatively 
little importance whether he was educated at this or that school, or any school, 
whether be preduaied from this or that college, or any college. The plain

the world’s work? 
The world needs such men and will find a place for them. It is quick to rec- 
ognize genuine education; as quick to reject the counterfeit, by applying the 
crucial test of power, the ability to do. 
- It seems to me, then, thatthe true ideal of education is the training, discipline, 
_ and development of the germ faculties of man existing in embryo in the child. 
It has been comprehensively defined, ‘‘the harmonious and equable evolution of 
_the human powers.” Ina broader and deeper sense than we generally under- 
. stand, “the child is father to the man.” 
A true ideal of education will correct the prevailing misapprehension as to 
‘what constitutes a “practical education.” ‘There is no gainsaying that our mar- 
_ yelous material development, the rapid increase of wealth, the abnormal thirst 
for accumulation, are seriously and dangerously affecting our idealsand methods 
of education. Cui bono? is the question on the ready tongues of pupils and par- 
enis, This question expresses a prevailing theory of education. It is the more 
- dangerous because there is a modicum of truth in it, an apt illustration of the 
aphorism that “‘half truths are the most dangerous errors.” 
That the chief end of education is not to qualify a man to get a living is obvi- 
ous, because life was given for a higher purpose Hose to toil for its own prolonga- 
tion. It is, then, a grievious mistake to throw away life in the effort merely to 
get a living, or to throw away the preparation for life in the preparation to get 
aliving. Real education sends one into the world tenfold better equipped to 
attain the very objects deemed so desirable by the advocates of the so-called 
practical education. 
It is claimed to be especially adapted to the ‘‘ industrial classes,” a vague, il- 
lusive, and misleading expression, based upon the pernicious idea of class dis- 
tinctions. So far as it has any meaning it includes all who do not belong to the 
“professions,” 7. ¢., law, medicine, and the ministry. ButI insist if there is any 
form of education that makes men stronger, wiser, nobler, the farmer, the arti- 
san, the merchant, he who in any capacity is to be the director of labor, the con- 
troller of men, needs that education to its fullestextent. What the world needs 
“and is asking for is not technical training and manual skill alone, valuable as 
these are, but, in the various industries, men of good brain, well-trained intel- 
lect, of stalwart vigor, men of conscience, of\fair culture, of sound judgment, 
ready in business, in the market, in the forum, in the workshop, on the farm, to 
meet the obligations and discharge the duties pertaining to family and society, © 
state and church, The true ideal of education recognizes and emphasizes the 
truth that behind the merchant, the mechanic, the farmer towers the man, and 
the man is more than his business or profession. 
The distinction between practical and any other kind of education is unphilo- 
pepe All real education from beginning to end is practical. Is not that 
education practical that develops a man’s capabilities, that reduplicates him? 
_ Is it not of practical benefit to subject the intellect to those forms of study and 
training which will evoke its latent resources? Just so long as manhood is a 
force of practical value in whatever his business or profession, just so long must 
we account that education practical which augments and Buriokes it. 
Let mere information take a secondary place—James P. Munroe, in the Educa- 
‘tional Review: It is not what we teach, it is how we teach, that is essential. 
In attempting toimprove the public schools the mistake has been made of in- 
creasing the curriculum instead of the teaching force, Given the tools of read- 
ing, writing, and figuring, the good teacher will make one further study, if need 
be, serve every purpose of primary education. The mental vice of these news- 
_ paper days is superficiality. This vice the schools are doing much to encour- 
_ age. Make the child accurate, thorough, persistent, logical, and let mere in- 
- formation take a secondary place. If he has acquired these qualities he has

in icaching him how to study the school has done its 
work. Beyond giving him the tools of knowledge the primary teaching can do 
little toward increasing the child’s stock of information. That will come to 
him outside the schoolroom. As said above, and as can not be too often said, 
the school isa gymnasium for making the child’s mind acquisitive and recep- — 
tive. The teaching of many subjects does not conduce to this. The immature — 
brain is naturally restless and roving; it is for the school to give it the power — 
of concentration. A child’s mind is impatient and easily diverted; it isfor the —_ 
school to teach it patience and perseverance. <A hasty clutching at many things © 
is easier and pleasanter to both teacher and pupil than thorough mastery of one 
thing; but the child who has really conquered one subject is he who, in man- 
hood, will win the knowledge of a thousand. 
The constituents of a sound education.—President E. B. Andrews, of Brown Uni- — 
versity: Speaking succinctly, the constituents of a sound education are. first, 
ebaracter ; second, culture ; third, critical power, including accuracy and also 
sympathy with all the various ages, nationalities, and moodsof men; and fourth, 
power to work hard under rule and under pressure. ; 3 
We see that here mere knowledge is left out of the account. It is quite inci-. 
dental and relatively insignificant. Yet, this is what most people have been ~ 
wont to regard as the sum and substance of education. We see, too, that the 
question what studies are to be pursued is not mentioned, although many con- 
tinually place it first. It is not unimportant. It would be pleasant to go into it 
deeply. Were we to do this, however, we should not enter the lists for the 
classics on the one hand, or for the sciences of nature on the other, but should 
urge rather the propriety of giving amuch larger place in the curriculum than 
has ever been given hitherto to the political sciences. But the structure and 
material of the curriculum is not to-day the most pressing educational question. 
The definition makes character part of education, and even gives it the first 
place. All reflecting persons are coming to fee] that unless schooling makes 
pupils morally better, purer within, and sweeter, kinder, stronger in outward 
conduct, it is unworthy the name. 4 
Culture comes next, by which is meant the power to apprehend and relish the 
beautiful in conduct, in act and literature, and in nature. Education must en- 
rich life, not enlighten it merely. Culture stands inimportance close to charac- 
ter, to which it is also very intimately related in essential nature, ard it is far 
more to be sought than mere mental ability. 
Third comes critical power, and mainly in the two great elements of accuracy 
and sympathy. Memorable ever is the thought of Cardinal Newman, that the 
principal part of a good education is accuracy. That one’s mind is full signifies 
nothing unless the contents are definite and analyzed. A little knowledge well 
grouped and ordered comes much nearer the ideal education than infinite funds 
lying unassorted in the mind like so much raw ore. 
To be accurate requires that of many things a finite mind should deliberately 
remain in ignorance. Toread all the books relating even to a subject in which 
one is especially interested would be @ positive disadvantage. Too much infor- - 
mation in detail confuses the mind, confronting it with a blurred, indefinite 
picture that can be of no service toit, instead of those clear, crisp, comprehen- _ 
sible outlines which are so valuable. Large newspaper reading is deleterious to- 
clear thinking beyond perhaps any other ef the numerous causes operative in 
that direction at the present day. 
Accuracy must be accompanied by sympathy, the power to draw near to men 
of all the different ages, civilizations, and temperaments, knowledge of the , 
race, of the world, and of God. Here is where the importance of historical study ; 
comes in. ‘There is one mind,” says Emerson, ‘‘common 40 all individual men. 
Every man_is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once ad- 
mitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What 
Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at 
any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this 
‘universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and 
sovereign agent.” ‘The true scholar must enter into this mind; the door to it 
is sympathy ; the latch, history. 
An important element of sympathy is freedom from prejudice; the power not 
to dismiss unstudied or contemned a view which at first sight strikes you as 
strange or even as false. This power is one of the very best tests of a truly edu- 
cated man. If you ean not to a good extent feel with your opponent, you duly. 
weigh his argument; and without this your disputing with him will but saw the 
air.

     AN 1140 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
With all these qualities must go self-mastery for each important purpose of 
life, the power to put and hold oneself to work, and to turn off large relays of in- 
tellectual or other work in a short time, This, too, is an essential ingredient 
in education, 
We ask too much from [school] education.—Frederic Harrison, in the Forum: 
Many things work delightfully for good while they are spontaneous and unor- 
ganized, but when they are stereotyped into an elaborate art and evolve a special 
profession or trade of experts they produce unexpected failures and end in 
more harm than good. We ask too much from education, we make too much of 
_ it, we monstrously overorganize it, and we cruelly overload it. Education can 
do for us infinitely less than we have come to expect, and what little it can do is 
on the condition that it be left simple, natural, and free. I have known very ° 
few men who were made into anything great entirely by their education; and [ 
have known a good many who were entirely ruined by it and were finally turned 
out as pedants, prigs, or idiots. Struggling to win prizes in examinations, 
thinking always about the style current to-day, being put through the regula- 
tion mill, and poring over some little corner of knowledge for some material 
object, may give a one-sided appearance of learning, with nothing behind it; 
will turn out mechanical eccentricitics like calculating machines; may change 
an honest fellow into a selfish, dull brute, or leave a weak brain softened and 
atrophied for life. And the more we organize education the greater is the risk 
of our finding this result. 
The school reverses the plan of nature.-—James L. Hughes, inspector of Toronto 
public schools (Canada): In the school of the future the pupil will originate most 
of the problems. The solution of problems is not so difficult as their conception. 
The power to recognize problems definitely is infinitely more important than 
the power to solve them. The most marked characteristic of childhood is its 
power to recognize the multitudes of new problems by which it is surrounded, 
and because this power is so strong it is therefore possible to develop it rapidly 
and definitely, and it was intended that it should so develop through the recog- 
nition of our material environment to the power of clear conception of all 
- the problems connected with our intellectual and spiritual life. 
Yet this power grows weaker instead of stronger as we grow older. The 
schools absolutely reverse the plan of nature. Before the child goes to school 
he discovers his own problems and solves most of them unaided. The few that 
he can not comprehend he brings to his seniors. When he goes to school his 
teacher brings the problems to him. Nature made a questioner, a seeker after 
truth ; the school makes him an answer. Nature made his mind to think; the 
school makes it a receptacle for other people’s thoughts. Nature gave him 
power to see the relationships between himself, and his environments, and his 
fellow-men, and his Creator; the school dwarfs this power by preventing its 
activity. We are often startled at the simplicity of new discoveries and inven- 
tions, and we wonder why we did not make them ourselves. Every new dis- 
covery or invention is merely the solution of a new problem in the relationship 
of natural forces. The power of solution depends on the power of recegnition. 
We could have solved the problems if we had been definitely conscisus of them. 
They were near us but we did not see them. If we had the power to see clearly 
the thousands of physical, intellectual, and spiritual problenis that are ever near 
us, how swiftly the world would move onward; how definite would be our con- 
scious growth towards God. But the schools train men to solve, not to find 
problems; to answer questions, not to recognize the mighty questions that 
need answering, and so there is not so much power of original investigation 
aud independent growth in the world-as there should be. The school of the 
future will preserve and develop the child’s conceptive relationship to nature 
and God, intellectually and spiritually. 
Fear has its place in the training of the will.—Report of committee of National 
Council of Education, George P. Brown, chairman: There is a prevailing senti- 
ment that incentives suggestive of pain are to be abolished from our curriculum 
of will-training. The anticipated pleasures of rightdoing are to be substituted 
everywhere for the anticipated pains of wrongdoing. ‘This finds expression in 
some large cities in the abolition, by order of the school authorities, of ail pun- 
ishment. The pulpit is influenced by this seutiment oftentimes to the extent of 
ignoring punishment for sin. The family is often dominated by the child’s im- 
pulses for the reason that it is unable to make desire, reverence, or interest ef- 
fective in giving dominance to ideas of obedience, and it rejects the incentive of 
pain as brutal. It is the conviction of the writer oi this paper that fear has its 
place among the incentives in the early training of the will.

  EDUCATION. =s 1141 
_ Original thinking wanted.—G. Stanley Hall: I would rather have a boy who has 
but little training in college attempt to add something to the world’s knowledge 
than to attempt to attain a high state of learning. 
What the young should know in advance and realize.—William James, professor 
Harvard University: Attention and effort are, as we shall see later, but two 
names for the same psychic fact. To what brain processes they correspond we 
do not know. The strongest reason for believing that they do depend on brain 
processes at all and are not pure acts of the spirit is just this fact, that theyseem 
in some degree subject to the law of habit, which is a material law. Asa final 
practical maxim relative to these habits of the law we may then offer something 
like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise 
every day.. That is, be systematically ascetic or heroic in little unnecessary 
points, do every day or two something for no other reason than that you would 
rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire need draws nigh it may find you 
not unnerved and untrained to stand the test. Asceticism of this sort is like the 
insurance which a man pays on his house and goods. The tax does him no good. 
at the time and possibly may never bring him areturn. But if the fire does 
ceme his having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. So with the man who 
has daily inured himself to habits of concentrated attention, energetic volition, 
and self-denial in unnecessary things. He will stand like a tower when every- 
thing rocks around him and when his softer fellow-mortals are winnowed like 
chaff in the blast. 
The physiological study of mental conditions is thus the most powerful ally of 
hortatory ethics. The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is 
no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by habitually fash- 
ioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young but realize how soon 
they will become mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed 
to their conduct while in the plastic state. Weare spinning our own fates, 
good or evil, and never to be undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice 
leaves its never so little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson’s 
play, excuses himself for every fresh dereliction by saying, ‘‘I won’t count this 
time.” Well! he may not count it, and akind Heaven may not count it; but it 
is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve cells and fibers the 
molecules are counting it, registering and storing it up to be’ used- against him 
when the next temptation comes. Nothing we ever do so is, in strict scientific 
literalness, wiped out. Of course this has its good side as well as its bad one. 
As we become permanent drunkards by so many separate drinks, so we become 
saints in the moral, and authorities and experts in the practical and scientific 
spheres, by so many separate acts and hours of work. Let no youth have any 
anxiety about the upshot of his education, whatever the line of itmay be. If 
he keeps faithfully busy each hour of the working day, he may safely leave the 
final result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count on waking up some 
fine morning to find himself one of the competent ones of his generation in what- 
ever pursuit he may have singled out. Silently, between all the details of his 
business, the power of judging in all that class of matter will have built itself 
up within him as a possession that will never pass away. Young people should 
know this truth in advance. The ignorance of it has probably engendered more 
discouragement and faint-heartedness in youths embarking on arduous careers 
than all other causes put together. ‘ 
What every boy is entitled to know.—President D. C. Gilman in the Cosmopoli- 
tan: Until he reaches maturity every boy requires positive guidance from those 
who have had a longer experience in the ways of the world. It is always cruel, 
and it may be criminal, to allow a youth to experiment for himself upon conduct— 
to say that he must sow his own wild oats, that experience is the best teacher, 
that he must choose his own course. Every boy is entitled to know what older 
persons have discovered of the laws of conduct, and to receive restraint, caution, 
and warning until his eyes have been opened and his power of judgment devel- 
oped. Nobody questions that he ought to be taught the laws of health, of diet, 
of poisons, of climate, or the laws that protect his person and his property; and 
itis surprising that anybody should question his right to initiation, by stringent 
discipline, into the laws of intellectual and moral well being. Every boy, whether 
he wishes it or not, should be trained. Yet the contrary doctrine is covertly 
heli, if not openly avowed, by many a tender mother and by many a generous 
father. Note the autobiography of John Stuart Mill. 
Too intense introspection not wanted.—President Gilman ({b.): The influence of 
modern psycho-physiologica! inquiries upon the coming generations is still un- 
determined. The good that is aimed at may perhaps surpass the evil that is

done. Certainly, in these days when morbid self-consciousness, extreme sensi- 
-tiveness, bashfulness, shyness, and timidity are so frequently apparent, the wise 
parent, the wise teacher will hesitate before encouraging in his own family or 
his own school too intense and too prolonged introspection. Give the boys plenty 
of open air, and when they can not have this, encourage within-doors exercise in 
_ handeraft, the use of tools, and knowledge of the book of sports, not to the ex- 
_ clusion of other studies, but as collateral security that the mind and the body 
shall be simultaneously developed. * * * 
Healthy, out-of-door lives, directed toward objects of enjoyment, of observa- 
_ tion, of sport, of acquisition, are better for boys than exclusive devotion to books, 
and especially than habits of introspection, self-examination, casuistry, journal 
writing. z 
- Home and school training contrusted.—James P. Munroe, in the Educational Re- 
view: The home and the school are two wholly different forces brought to bear 
upon the growing child. Each has its proper sphere, and the methods of the 
one have no place in the system of the other. Judiciously exerted, one supple- 
menting the other, these two influences should produce patriotic, moral, well- 
balanced citizens. No argument is needed to prove the unfitness of school 
methods to home training ; there should be no need of proof that home methods 
have little or no place in the school. The child whose parents treat him from 
- the standpoint of the pedagogue is a pitiful creature, starved morally, surfeited 
mentally. A child who has been trained in a‘‘ home” school, by methods which 
have no right beyond the walls of a house, is even less well fitted for good citi- 
zenship. Home training should be always indirect, persuasive ; school training 
direct, authoritative. Home must be suggestive; school training, mandatory. 
- Home training should be mainly by example; school training by fact and pre- 
cept. Home training must leave free play to the child’s mental growth ; school 
training must prune and contro! that growth. The home fits the child to be a 
man, the school prepares him to be citizen ; one is natural, common to humanity, 
the other artificial, peculiar to the state. It is seldom that the proper combi- 
nation of these two elements is reached. * * * The right moral training 
_ tempers love with duty and duty with love. This moral training can be per- 
feeted only within the home. School life is but a mental gymnasium in which 
to make the child receptive and acquisitive. 
To be preferred to any sort of learning.—Locke: Under whose care soever @ 
child is put to be taught during the tender and flexible years of his life, this is 
certain, it should be one who thinks Latin and languages the least part of educa- 
tion; one who, knowing how much virtue and a well-tempered soul is to be* 
preferred to any sort of learning or language, makes it his chief business to form 
_ the mind of his scholars and give that a right disposition, which if once got, 
though all the rest should be neglected, would in due time produce all the rest; 
and which, if it be not got and settled so as to keep out ill and vicious habits, 
languages and sciences and all the other accomplishments of education will be 
to no purpose but to make the worse and more dangerous man. 
The great end of all teachirig.—-Tate’s Philosophy of Edueation: Without losing 
sight of the importance of practical knowledge, especially at the later stages of 
elementary instruction, the truly enlightened educator will ever regard the. de- 
_ velopment of the faculties.as the great end of all his teaching; but from the 
various useful matters of instruction he will always select that which is best cai- 
culated to secure this end, and his mode or system of teaching will always have 
a reference to the same great end. The question with him will not be, Have I 
~ conveyed the greatest amount of technical knowledge in the least time? Have 
- Lengrafted the ideas of the man upon the mind of the boy ? but it will rather be, 
Have I awakened any element of intellectual or moral vitality which had hith- 
erto lain dormant? Have I invigorated or purified any faculty which had hith- 
- erto existed in a feeble or in an imperfect state of development? And has all 
gels Ogen attained with a due regard to the future pursuits and destiny of the 
: pupils 
As to self-education.—Charles A. Dana: The worst school that a man can be 
sent to (and the worst of all itis for a man of genius) is what is called a self- 
_ edueation. There isno greater misfortune for a man of extraordinary talent 
than to be educated by himself, because he has of necessity a very poor school- 
master. There is nothing more advantageous to an able youth than to be thrown 
into contact with other youths in the conflict of study and in the struggle for supe- 
riority in the school.and in the college. z '

HIGHER EDUCATION. ~ Dae 
V.—HicHER Epucation. 
College-bred men in the business world.—Andrew Carnegie: The total absence 
of the college graduate inevery department of affairs should be deeply weighed. © 
I have inquired and searched everywhere in all quarters, but find scarcely a 
trace of him. Nor is this surprising. The prize-takers have too many years — 
the start of the graduate; they have entered for the race invariably. in their 
teens—in the most valuable of all the years for learning anything—from 14 to 
20. While the college student has been learning a little about the barbarous and 
petty squabbleg of a far-distant past, or trying to master languages which are ~ 
, dead, such knowledge as seems adapted for life upon another planet than this 
as far as business affairs are concerned, the future captain of industry is hotly — 
engaged in the school of experience, obtaining the very knowledge required for 
his future triumphs. I do not speak of the effect of college education upon - 
young men training for the learned professions; but the almost total absence of 
the graduate from high position in the business world seems to justify the con- 
clusion that college education as it exists is fatal to success in that domain. 
The graduate has not the slightest chance, entering at 20, against the boy who 
swept the office, or who begins as shipping clerk at 14. The facts prove this. 
Henry Clews: I have given itsome thought, and my conclusions are the re- 
sult of experience. I might say in beginning that I do not employ college mon 
in my banking office. None need apply. I don’t want them, for I think they 
have been spsiled for business life. 
After spending several of the best years, the years when the mind is most — 
active and most open to impression, in learning alot of things which are utterly 
useles3 for business, they come to the cities to make their way in the world. 
They are perfectly ignorant of business methods. Their whole education has 
tended to shut their minds to knowledge of this kind. While they have been 
at college other men have been in the business offices, have begun at the bottom 
and have worked up, learning all the details, getting that knowledge which ~ 
can not be set down in books. . 2 
Now, the college graduate is not willing to begin at the bottom. He looks 
down on the humble place which he is fitted to fill. And, indeed, he looks 
down on all business as duliand unattractive. He wants a place suchas hised- 
ucation and his years seem to command. This place he can not get, for he has 
. a3 yet the A, B, C’s of business to acquire. 
And even if he does bring himself to aceept the place, which he must accept 
if he would have any measure of success, he does not utilize it in a way to ad- 
vance. His thoughts are not with his business, but with his books, literature, — 
philosophy, Latin. Now, no man can approach the exacting business life in 
this half-hearted way. Business requires the undivided mind. 
Winthrop D. Sheldon, in the New Englander and Yale Review :! It is not less 
education, but more and better, that is needed in business life, an education that 
is so all-around as to give a larger success than, the mere accumulation of a for- — 
tune. Hitherto such have been the unexampled opportunities for fortune-mak- . 
ing, always to be found in a new and undeveloped country, that multitudes of ~ 
men have ‘‘stumbled” into wealth, not because of any special capacity of their — 
own superior to that of their neighbors, but by some happy accident. The at- 
tainment of riches by no means proves that a man possesses superior ability in 
any large sense of the term. Indeed, it has been well said that very often the 
rich man in a community is conspicuously stupid, ignorant, and narrow-minded 
outside of his special sphere. This is thenatural result of alifetime’s “‘money- 
grubbing,” when all of a man’s thoughis and energies are concentrated upon the 
one object of making money for money’s sake. If it be true that comparatively 
few of the college-educated win a great fortune, it is doubtless due in great 
easure to the fact, which is much to their credit, that such men have too many 
and diversified intellectual interests to be able or willing to turn themselves 
into mere money-making machines. Thereby the community at large is greatly 
the gainer and its common life is preserved from becoming mercenary and 
sordid. Ee 
Does it not involve a serious impeachment of the standards of business capac- ~ 
ity to maintain that a youth of 14, who goes at once into a store, his mental — 
powers as yet comparatively undisciplined, and spends the next few years in_

  sweeping it out, running of errands, and tying up bundles, is more likely to 
- achieve a pronounced business success than the college graduate, who mean- 
while has been schooling himself to accurate thinking, cultivating his pewers 
of observation and reflection, storing his mind with a wide range of knowledge 
and bringing it into permanent relation with those things which adern and 
dignify our lives and make them really worth the living? The education of the 
store and the counting room or the shop, exceedingly valuable in its way, is in 
the comparison essentially narrow in its scope; and, narrow and narrowing, it is 
_ going on during the very years when the question is being determined in the 
case of mest persons whether their future life is to be of a narrow or of a broad. 
gauge pattern. The great mass of business men are men of mere routine; they 
are made such by their lack of a thorough general education and by the narrew 
lines of their early training, and the trend of their lives is to confine them in this 
mental bias. The man who brings to the routine of his work a broadly trained 
intelligence will be worth in the long run a great deal more than he who for 
lack of such intelligence is a slave to routine. 
President Seth Low, of Columbia College (who has been himself a business 
man): While itis harder for a college graduate to getstarted in business than for 
one whe enters it as a boy, in five years from the time he does start, other things 
being equal, the college graduate will be the peer in business of his friend who 
began as a boy, and while equally successful in business he will filla much larger 
place in the community than the one-sided man can ever hope to fill. 
James W. Alexander, a Princeton graduate and vice-president of the Equi- 
table Life Assurance Society of New York: However it may be with the boy 
whose talents, temperament, and environmentsare such as to limit his prospects 
and ambition to a life of physical labor in a subordinate capacity, who can doubt 
that the boy who has within him the germ of some future master in affairs will 
be all the more of a leader by reason of a thorough college education and even 
that he will outstrip in the mere matter of time the boy whose only training _ 
was sweeping theshop or adding up columns of figures ata desk? It is the suc- 
cessful men we are talking about. And when the shop-bred boy reaches the 
high station to which his abstention from college education has assisted him, 
does it require argument to prove that he would be a more useful, a more influ- 
ential, a more attractive man if he could have added to and combined with his 
industrial training that knowledge, science, literature, and philosophy to the 
mastering of which the college is the open door? 3 
Mr. Charles L. Colby, a graduate of Brown University and president of the 
Wisconsin Central Railroad: Iadmit a man may succeed in banking or business 
without an education, but I earnestly believe that if two men of equal ability 
start together in the race, one an educated man and the other without college 
training, the college man will win every time in the long run. Machinery and 
methods are constantly changing. The uneducated do not readily comprehend 
them and must be instructed step by step. The more aman is educated, the 
more readily he adapts himself to these sudden changes in business methods. 
When it comes to the scientific, technical, brain requirements of a calling, the 
college man moves easily ahead. 
Mr. Daniel Heald, a Yale graduate and president of the Home Insurance Com- 
pany of New York: I believe the success I may have attained in the world is 
directly due to my college training. I there acquired system, analysis, and 
methods of thought that have been of inestimable value in life. If nature has 
given aman fair talent education will make better a man of him and positively aid 
him in his daily work. Suppose a boy is going into any manufacturing busi- 
ness—making pumps, forexample. Givehimaneducation. He will make better 
pumps because of it. Strip the rich, uneducated man of his wealth and what is 
left? What we want in American life is the ripe, well-rounded man of affairs. 
Gen. Brayton Ives, a Yale graduate: Given a boy with a natural aptitude for 
business, his college training, particularly in methods of thought, will afterward 
be of such practical aid as more than to offset the loss of those years in business. 
Observe that learning how to learn is the summarized advantage of a college 
training ; that is, it is the discipline which the boy obtains at college that en- 
ables him to learn after he leaves college and learn more rapidly, readily, and 
intelligently than his uneducated competitors. I can trace every step in my 
own career to the influence of my college course, and as every man can, of course, 
speak best of his own life, it is not egotistical to be personal. I was graduated 
from Yale in 1861, entered the Army, and instantly found my training of the 
utmost benefit. Being accustomed to study, I mastered the tactics more easily 
and in less time than was required by men whose minds had not been trained.

This enabled.me to compete with men who had been there much longer than I 
and was the cause of much more rapid promotion than I could have gained other- 
wise. All the progress I have since made in civil life, including that of my 
present occupation—banking—is directly traceable to the special advantages 
afforded by my education. A man of ability educated is better, no matter where 
he may be placed, than a man of ability uneducated. 5 
Chauncey M. Depew,a Yale graduate: Have the eight years passed in the 
preparatory schcol and the university, acquiring many things which would be 
useless in the factery or store, been thrown away? My observatien leads me to 
directly the contrary opinion. The college-bred man, under equal conditions of © 
capacity and health, has a trained intellect, a disciplined mind, a store of infor- 
mation, and a breadth of grasp, with the fearlessness which it entails, that ena- 
ble him to catch up with and pass his rival. Hundreds of college graduates 
within the last five years have begun in the various departments of railway 
work atthe bottom. They were firing on the locomotives, working in the ma- 
chine shops, switching in the yards, ‘keeping books in the treasurer’s office, 
serving in the freight and passenger departments, and my observation of them 
for this period has demonstrated the value of a college education. It used to be 
a popular theory that strong men who had won great placestin the business world 
would have been ruined if they had been educated. The better belief is that 
on account of genius and special capacity they succeeded in spite of their disad- 
vantages. It is the old question of the trained boxer, runner, athlete, debater, 
soldier, as against unskilled strength and courage. Whatever the popular de- 
lusions, in the trials there never has been but one result. 
Winthrop D. Sheldon: Mr. Carnegie must have been gazing at the mountains 
and craters of the moon, inquiring and searching there, when he asserted the 
“total absence of the college graduate in every department of affairs.” Hadhe 
taken pains to look about him he would have found successful college-bred men 
of business almost under the eaves of his factory in Pittsburg itself. If inquiry 
“ were to be made every important commercial or manufacturing center would 
furnish some conspicuous examples of the college man of affairs. Mr. James W. 
Alexander, from whom we have already quoted, reénforced his views with a list’ 
of 65 college graduates prominent in business circles and selected at random, 
mostly from New York and vicinity, and other names almost if not equally as 
significant will occur to every observant person. From an analysis of the list 
we notice that there are 15 railroad officials, including, besides vice-presidents 
and general managers, 6 presidents, among them Chauncey M. Depew, of the 
New York Central system; Charles Francis Adams, of the Union Pacific; Aus- 
tin Corbin, of the Philadelphia and Reading, recently chosen president of the 
New York and New England; and to these we may add the late Frederick Bil- 
lings, at one time president of the Northern Pacific; the late Levi C. Wade, of 
the Mexican Central, and Presidents Bishop and Watrous, of the New York and 
New Haven Railroad. There are also 18 bankers, including a number of bank 
presidents, 10 manufacturers, 10 merchants, 7 heads of prominent trast and in- 
surance companies, and 5 headsof leading publishing houses. Certainly neither — 
the late Alexander T. Stewart, the prince among dry-goods merchants, nor the 
late John Jacob Astor, who had the reputation of being an excellent business 
man, found the education which they obtained, respectively at Dublin Univer- 
sity and Columbia College, any impediment whatever in the way of their suc- 
cess. It is said of the former that he retained his interest in his college studies 
to the latest years of his life. . 
Mr. Sheldon sums up as follows: The great mass of those who enter the vari- 
ous eccupations of the business world could not, if they would, receive a college 
education. Most of them would not improve the opportunity if they had it, and 
it would be of no advantage to most, because they are not fitted to profit byit. But’ 
the youth who can have such an education, and is fitted to profit by it, is on no 
account justified in rejecting the opportunity for fear it will incapacitate him 
for a successful business career. Let him get all the education he can,inthefull 
assurance that he will be more of a man, and therefore, more of a business man; 
not a man of an affair, but a man of affairs. For what men are in any one phase 
or province of their lives is largely determined by what they are in every other. 
No part of the individual life can escape the uplift which a thorough education 
gives to the entire being. And the young graduate who decides to set his face 
towards a business career has no occasion to look upon the four years of his col- 
lege life as thrown away or to feel that he is handicapped in the race for success. 
It is not necessary for him to begin where the boy of fourteen begins, whose age 
and lack of training unfit him for anything higher than plying the broom and 
    
-P-A-G-E-554
        _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
running of errands. His age, mental training, and general maturity enable 
him to apply himself at once to the study of business methods themselves;. Nor 
ean any fixed rule be laid down as to the length of his novitiate. That will vary 
according to his ability, industry, and power of adaptation, and also according to 
the nature of the business which he has undertaken tolearn. It may, in some 
instances, be only months; it may require years to master all the details. But 
4S ho proceeds the practical value of his education will become more and more 
apparent. The success of college-bred men who have adopted a business career 
will compare favorably with that of business men in general. They have been 
successful, not in spite of their education, but in part because of it. Education 
is no magic key that of itself unlocks the doors of succ2ss in any department of 
life; but in. business, as in other occupations, if joined to health, industry, en- 
ergy, and common sense it will win a success of finer mold and more enduring, 
more satisfying quality ; it will be its own justification. 
Oid vs. new institutions of learning.—President G. Stanley Hall, of Clark Univer- 
sity: Age which brings wisdom may bring infirmities. In a time and land 
re change is so rapid trustees, alumni, and even faculties sometimes fall be- 
hind. Time is lost in administrative details better left toone. Young men are 
held back, and talent not held to its best thing, but kept doing the work of 
cheaper men, and the question may become pertinent why, with vast resources, 
80 little is done for culture and for the advancement of knowledge by old insti- 
tutions or comparatively so much by new ones. There is much to foster com- 
placency and an unfortunate absence of competent criticism from without, 
- whence all university reforms in history have really come. Prejudices may 
_ accumulate from without, and student custom and ideals grow up within that 
are as inveterate and ineradicable as they are vicious and absurd, but which 
make progress slow and hard. There is sometimes an excess of conseryations, 
routine,and machinery. Saddestof all, perhaps, departments of endowed knowl- 
edge, like professors, sometimes cease to be productive and grow dry, formal, 
_ sterile, but they can not be displaced. It may be harder to regard an old insti- 
tution as a means, precious only as it broadly serves the highest culture-interests 
of the whole nation, and not as an end precious in and for itself. We know how 
wasteful and unproductive the vast resources of Oxford and Cambridge had be- 
come in 1854, and what old abuses had to be corrected in Italy and Holland by 
such and other somewhat drastic outside means. In this new country we need 
_ new men, new measures, and occasionally new universities; and we, like England, 
have in later years experienced theiramazing good. Inthe field of experimental 
science, unlike some other departments, what is there of importance, that a few 
centuries can afford, that can not be at least as well provided in a few years?     
                          
   
                      
    
   
                         
   
                                The differentiation of higher educational institutions urged.—G. Stanley Hall: 
_ We [at Clark University] duplicate almost nothing in other universities in 
thiscountry.. A full department of physics, chemistry, or mathematics even, 
to say nothing of biology, the complexity of which is more obvious, as sketched 
for us by several European leaders in their field, would each require several 
professors, each with one or more assistant professors to represent its several 
‘sections or departments of the subject. Thus, to say nothing of difference of 
- grade or standard, it does not follow, because we have physics, chemistry, and 
‘other departments found in other institutions, there is duplication. The con- 
trary is, in fact, the case. The best professors in their fields, however authori- 
tative they may be in the entire department, excel in and contribute chiefly to 
bat a few chapters of it, leaving ample space for other directions of excellence 
_. elsewhere. 
In the new era of university development, upon which this country is now en- 
tering, it is of fundamental importance for economy and for the success of a 
great movement that, in place of the monotonous uniformity, duplication, and 
‘servile imitation that has prevailed, institutions should freely differentiate 
and should be known to do so; that above the commendable loyalty to local in- 
stitutions by their graduates, there should arise the same comparative and 
_ critical discrimination of institutions asof courses in the same institutions under 
the elective system. Perhaps the chief benefit of the latter has been the stim- 
ulus it gave to every professor to make his course so profitable that it should 
prove attractive to the most of the best students. The same stimulus could be 
given to institutions by the extension of the elective system to them. 
What a real university is—Nicholas Murray Butler: The university is a wholly 
_ different institution from the college, and while in this country we have scores

of hominal universities, the real ones may be counted on the fingers of a single 
hand. A college.in which the course of study is elective wholly or in part is not’ 
auniversity. A group of professional or technical schools is not a university. 
A college and a group of professional and technical schools taken together i8 
not a university. A university must have for its heart and soul the great philo- 
t sophical faculty of the Germans ; thefaculty which finds its reason for existence — 
in the preservation of the humanities and in a careful and loving study of phil-_ 
osophy, philology, and letters. A university is marked by the time-honored — 
freedom in teaching and freedom in study; it knows no trammels, no compul- 
sion. It is not a disciplinary institution, but rather a field for research and in- 
vestigation. At the university the bounds of knowledge will be continually 
widened and the leaders of the future generation in science and literature trained _ 
to their work. Professional schools or faculties, apart from the philosophical 
faculty, haye always become technical and narrow—it is the philosophical fac-_ 
ulty that is the real university center. Its spirit and insight must regulate and 
inspire all of the associated faculties.    
    
    
    
                                    
     
     
   
              
   
   VI.—KINDERGARTENS, 
The kindergarten the great remedy for formalism in the primary school.—W. T. _ 
Harris: The school teaches the conventionalities of life; it gives the child ae 
cess to the wisdom of the race, but it often errs in making its experiences to the 
child too formal. It is too rigid and unsympathetic, and the child is expected 
to throw off the freedom of the family at once, and all too soon assume the for- 
malities of the world. Thus did the great need of a connecting link between 
the two call for some noble-hearted lover of his kind to suggest a change, and 
Froebel, whose memory all kindergartens, all true educgtionalists reverence, 
came to the rescue and supplied the need. The kindergarten takes the little 
one in his tenderest years, and by placing within his reach symbols and games 
suited to his comprehension, enables him to naturally, and without undue or — 
forced effort, grasp and assimilate the ideas and teachings desired. It makes — 
him notice what is going on in the great world around him, and seeing begets 
the desire to imitate. It leads him up from the initial stage of feeling to think- _ 
ing, and from thought to action. But the games and plays are only a portionof 
the work; there are gifts and occupations. These are less symbolical and more © 
logical, and train the quantitative faculties. A child does not readily realize — 
what it means to think quantity ; it is a hard and awkward step for him to take, 
and the idea of number, for instance, must be learned not by starting at a unit 
and adding, but by taking a divisible unit and dividing it; and thus Froebel, 
who perceived this point, introduced the divisible block. The kindergarten is 
the great remedy of this century for the formalism of the primary school, and it 
had been badlv needed before it came to the rescue. 
What children have a right to expect from the kindergartner.—W. E. Sheldon: 
Children have a right to expect that their individuality shall be recognized and 
respected; that their natural and hereditary traits shall be taken into account 
in their training; thet all manifestations of interest in their development and 
culture shall be genuine; that an active and progressive intelligence shall be 
supplemented by a well-balanced self-poise of the trained kindergartner which 
the child will soon discover to be an element of true manhocd or womanhood 
worthy of imitation; that their many questions shall be regarded as of impor- 
tance and that the replies shall stimulate further respectfulinguiries. Questions 
are the natural openings of the child’s mind, which natural inclination prompts, 
and aid the teacher inthe work of instruction. Youshould convince the learner 
that all proper inquiries are in order at suitable times and that it is a pleasure 
for you to answer them. If the inquisitiveness becomes unprofitable in charac- — 
ter or in frequency use your best tact as the means of restraining it. Let the 
child appear to exercise the right of personal liberty and yet not gratify what 
may be really an unworthy curiosity.   
Some straws.—The report of Superintendent Cassidy (Lexington, Ky.) declares ~ 
the greatest need of the schools to be kindergartens. <3 Sa 
Dr. James Mac Alister: To my mind to-day no problem is so important as the — 
kindergarten universal. 4 
Superintendent W.H. Love(Buffalo,N. Y.): The first change to be attempted ’ 
in our school reform is to bring in the kindergarten or subprimary work.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  4 VIL—MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
Effect of industrial education upon general education.—Prof. Felix Adler: During 
an experience of 12 years in the application of manual training in the teaching 
of children between 6 and 14 years of age, I have observed that manual training 
in the ordinary school is the means of saving those children who are plainly and 
obvieusly deficient in what may be called literary quality. There are many 
children who are very slow in reading, in arithmetic, and in history, and it has 
been my observation that these children, especially numerous among the poorer 
classes, are at once stimulated intellectually by the opportunities of the school 
workshop. It has been my invariable experience that children who are slow in 
their progress in reading and history and mathematics are very quick in nat- 
- ural history and in drawing and in the workshop. Especially has the conjunc- 
tion of a talent for natural history and for manual training frequently impressed. 
itself upon me. The effect has been to stimulate these children not only in 
manual training and in natural history, but, awakening their self-confidence and 
self-respect, to stimulate them generally. Those boys who, in an ordinary pub- 
lic school, would be set down as dunces because they make no progress, and who 
would begin to consider themselves dunces after a while, find themselves facile 
princeps in the shop and in natural history, and gain the respect of others and 
take a new start. The best work in modeling and manual training in the school 
of which I have charge has been done by such pupils. Surely, therefore, this 
is an argument in favor of introducing manual training from the point of view 
of general education. If manual training can promote the intellectual training 
of a very large number of children defective on the intellectual side, that is a 
sufficient reason why it should be introduced. 
_ Another resultof my observation has been that the school-workshop is a means 
of strengthening the mathematics, the drawing and the elementary physics teach- 
ing. Although the main object, as the president has said, should be to educate 
the eye and the hand, nevertheless this education should not be unassociated 
with the other studies of the curriculum. The object should be to connect the 
manual training with the work of the class-room, and this can be accomplished 
by close connection between the work of the shop and the drawing, mathemst- 
ics, elementary physics, etc. The pupils are asked to make their own physical 
apparatus, and geometrical figures are of course constantly brought before them, 
and many opportunities are offered for making their space perceptions more ¢efi- 
nite and clear. Another advantage in such aschool brings me to what Profes 
or Patten has said as to the function of the teacher taking the place of the 
military officer. It is very difficult for the teacher in the ordinary school room 
to discharge that function, but the teacher in the shop can doit. The pupils 
“must present themselves before him before they go to work. He inspects their 
clothing and sees that they are neat, that they are neat in their work, that they 
put away their tools and keep them properly; he gives that personal supervi- 
sien to the habits of his little workmen which should be given, but which the 
other teacher can not give. 
Tn all respecis I can say that we have found after 12 years of observation that 
the regular work of the school has been strengthened by the introduction of 
manual training, and especially the English work and the compositions. The 
great difficulty lies in controlling the expression of the pupil’s thoughts, of know- 
ing what is in the pupil’s mind. The teacher must know this in order to be able 
to control the pupil’s thought. By introducing shop teaching and requiring the 
pupil to describe the operations which he has performed in the shop, and to de- 
scribe the work in the factories he visits, the master of the shop is enabled to 
know approximately the content of the pupil’s mind and to control his manner 
of expression. , 
  VIII.—METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. 
The best methods of teaching modern languages.—Ex-President E. H. Magill, of 
Swarthmore College: What then do I recommend to the students of the modern 
foreign languages in our colleges? First, that they should rid themselves, 
once for all, of the idea that a little smoothly flowing, trivial conversation, 
upon topics of daily interest, in another tongue, is the sine qua non, and that 
' they should not spend, not to say waste, their valuable and overcrowded time 
in acquiring this fluent speech. The ‘natural method” (so called) of teaching 
the modern languages, in its unadulterated state, I consider to be one of the 
greatest popular fallacies of modern times.. The very expression, ‘‘ natural    
-P-A-G-E-557
     
    1149 
method,” is in itself misleading and a misnomer. If it really were the natural 
method, it would surely commend itself to all educators. But it should be re- 
membered that what may be natural for young children, in acquiring their 
own tongue, is by no means natural for more mature minds. Children acquire 
their language by simple imitation, often repeated, with little or no exercise 
of the reasoning powers. No such method is possible with older persons in 
acquiring a foreign tongue. I say that no such method is really possible, after 
the reasoning powers have made any degree of development; and I will add 
that, if it were so, there is not time in this short life for its successful applica- 
tion. How much of written and spoken language does a young child learn in 
two months? I need scarcely say that it learns nothing in this time except how 
to utter afew common words and phrases, and, of course, nothing whatever of 
written or printed speech. And yet, in two months a mature mind may acquire 
enough knowledge of a foreign tongue to enable him to begin to read it with 
pleasure, and in two more months to read with considerable rapidity, and begin 
to make the acquaintance of authors whom it is a privilege to know. The 
“natural method,” I say then, for mature minds, is wholly unnatural and — 
irrational. 
Observe that I do not say that the ability to converse intelligently in a foreign 
tongue is a knowledge to be undervalued and despised ; but Ido say most em- 
phatically that this knowledge can never be acquired except by daily associa- 
tion with those to whom the language is their mother tongue, without the ex- 
penditure of an amount of time entirely incommensurate with its real value. 
‘Those who are never to mingle with foreigners can have no practical use for the 
language as a medium of conversation, and for those who are to do this there is 
no more valuable preparation than that obtained from reading and hearing read 
by a competent linguist the language to be learned. That this reading may be 
extensive, even in the short courses which our colleges can afford, there must 
be a thorough ground work laid by becoming rapidly familiar with the forms 
and coxstructions of the language and the principal common idioms and a vo- 
cabulary should be acquired as fast as possible, after the forms become some- 
what familiar, by reading the language even superficially at first; and reading 
not in the ordinary readers of mere fragments from various authors, but read- 
ing some complete seléctions from authors of unquestioned reputation. 
Hence, I say, make the grammatical drill short, sharp, incisive ; reduce the 
amount of grammar needed for reading to a minimum ; and by all means never 
waste time in the bootless and wearisome task of turning good English into poor 
French in the early stages of the course. It is quite early enough for a student 
to begin writing original French when he becomes familiar, after a great 
amount of reading (partly superficial, for rapidity, and partly critical, for thor- 
oughness of knowledge) with the manner in which other persons write it! But 
this is by no means to be understood as ruling out dictée exercises, which 
should be practiced almost daily from the beginning. Itis excellent practice for 
a student to write out translations in English of the language studied, and then 
restore it to the language from which it was taken. Many points, which would: ~ 
escape notice entirely if merely translation into English were followed, would 
thus receive attention and be rapidly and firmly impressed upon the memory. 
The one panacea in teaching Greck.—Thomas D, Seymour, professor of Greek 
at Yale: The most foolish thing in education is the suffering of words to be for- 
gotten as soon as they are learned. For this evil but one cure can be found— 
review. If I am ever pronounced a monomaniac this is the subject which will 
be found uppermost in my mind. This is the one panacea which I offer for all 
ordinary ills and troubles in learning Greek: If the student learns with diffi- 
culty or forgets easily, if he has weak eyes or an aching head, if he has but little 
time for study or is behind his class, whether he wants to excel in Greek or 
wishes to take-as little pains as possible with the language, let him review! 
The principle of reviewing, of course, is this: If I am introduced to a man on 
the train and have a casual half-hour’s conversation with him to-day I may be 
able to identify that man at once.a year hence, or, having near-sighted eyes and 
thus a dull memory for faces, 1 may be compelled to say: ‘‘I remember your 
face very well, but I confess I can not say where I have met you before.” But . 
if I have a ten-minutes’ talk with that man to-day, meet him on the street and 
exchange greetings with him next week, talk with him again for five minutes 
amonth hence, see him and some of his relatives for a few moments in the 
spring, I could identify that man with certainty a year or ten years hence, al- 
though I had never spentin all more than half an hour with him. So with 
words. If a student meets a word to-day and is introduced to it, has a little . METHODS OF INSTRUCTION.

_ chat with it, as we may say, but does not meet that word again for two months, 
he is obliged to say: “ Your face is familiar, but I can not call you by name. 
I must apply to my nomenclator for information about you.” 
The plan of reviewing which students should be urged to adopt, and which 
they must be stimulated constantly to follow, is toreview the day’s lesson as soon 
as possible after the exercise in the classroom. Only thus can the corrections : 
which have been inculeated be fixed firmly in the mind. -Otherwise when the 
1 student takes up that work after an intermission of one, two, or three days he is 
apt to remember only that something has been said on this or that point. Often ! 
- he is not quite sure whether a member of the class gave one rendering and the 
teacher strongly preferred the other, or whether the case was just reversed. 
But if he reviews the work soon after the lesson is read he can not fail to remem- 
_ ber the circumstances and the exact point that was made. Now, if once a week 
- the student takes time (perhaps half an hour) to review all the Greek he ha3 
read during the week no special effort is required ; he remembers the meaning 
of the words and phrases and the whole situation. Again,if once a month the 
student takes the time (perhaps an hour or an hour and a half) to review all the 
Greek he has read during the preceding month, no great effortis required ; the - - 
' words and constructions are familiar. Then the general review at the close of 
the term becomes what it should be, a look from a superior position over the 
whole field which has been traversed. Mostof the details of that work are fixed 
in the memory for life, and even if they should become dimmed they may be 
- easily brightened. 
The only objection that can be raised to such a system of reviews is that it 
takes time. And so it does at first; but the time which is invested in that way 
bears the heaviest interest from the very outset. The advantage gained from ta 
the thorough appreciation of the situation, through the familiarity with the ear- 
lier portions of the work will be felt at once. The same words and constructions 
_ are constantly recurring, as the student will remember in his vexation when he 
is obliged to look up a word for the fifth or tenth time. 
How to learn to read Greek as a living language.—Prof. Thomas D. Seymour, of 
Yale University (in school and college): If the teacher has not time to have the 
_ Greek both read aloud and translated, he should omit par*of the translation and 
have all read aloud. * * * . 
This practice in pronouncing Greek words until they are as familiar to the 
ear es they are to the eye, should begin with the very beginning of the study of 
Greek. If this is neglected then the loss can never be made good. 
Probably many of you are familiar with what the well-known archzologist, 
- our countryman by adoption, who died less than a year ago, Dr. Heinrich 
Sehliemann, has written with regard to his experience in learning foreign lan- 
_ guages, in which he had unusual success, When he, as an errand boy in Ham- 
burg, saw that his promotion in business could be gained only by a knowledge 
_ of the Russian language, he could find no teacher, but set to work with an old 
. Russian grammar and a copy of a Russian translation of 7¢lémaque, which he 
found at an old book stall. , He read this Russian Telemachus aloud, and in order 
to force himself to persist in this, he hired, for afew cents a night, an old man 
who knew not a word of Russian to hear him read this work aloud for three 
hours every evening! Schliemann afterwards learned about a dozen other lan- 
guages in a similar way, and believed with all his heart that his success in this 
matter was due solely to his patiencs and persistence in reading aloud. 
If from the first the Greek is made thoroughly familiar to ear and torgue, the 
easy, oft-recurring words like those for house, boy, man, woman, horse, etc., would 
demand no more effort of mind for theirapprehension than many English words, 
like mansion, steed, etc., which the school boy does not himself ordinarily use. 
And if the most frequent words require no effort of the memory the more time 
~ and strength are reserved for the rarer and more difficult words. 
-. But the reading of the Greek aloud not cnly aids materially in fixing the 
meanings of words in the memory; it also renders important service in assisting 
the mind to grasp a clause or a whole sentence as a complex, and to receive the 
thought of the whole as a unit, rather than in separate details, each of which oe 
has to be disentangled from the rest. Thus, and thus only, does the beginner 
learn to read Greek as a living language, and he will find true literary enjoy- 
ment as he gains increased facility in reading without conscious translation. 
The home-study of pupils.—Margaret W. Sutherland, in the Ohio Educational 
Monthly: The giving of work to pupils simply to give them home-work seemed

presented itself. Ihad always determined what I thought a proper amount of 
work to require from my pupils and then allowed it to be done at any time they 
could do it. I believe very. thorowghly in giving them work to do and then 
holding them responsible for the doing of it. * * * ButI do not like the 
teacher to assume that she has the control of an hour, an hour and a half, or two 
hours, out of school time. Indeed, when one is among teachers, the queztion 
sometimes seems not to be ‘‘ Have teachers any rights that parents are bound to 
respect ?” but *‘ Have parents any rights at all in their children?”. % 
In the earlier years of schvol life, I can scarcely see the two sides to the qus- 
tion, ‘Shall a child study out of school hours?” It may be that my range of 
vision is narrow. Iam ready to have it widened by any one whowill give me 
more light. But these early years are so evidently a period for physical 
growth ; nature so plainly points out the necessity for play; there is so much to 
be learned through childish investigation of the world lying about, that more 
than five hours of the day that ought to be much shorter than the grown per- 
son's day on account of the amount of sleep so necessary for proper growth, to 
be spent on school-work is eminently unwise. Psychologists and physiologisis 
both warn us against the danger of overstimulation of the brain, which leads to 
‘“‘an increased activity of the organ due to an unfair distribution of the physical 
energy, the organ of the mind being enriched at the expense of the vital or- 
gans.” I deprecate the requiring little children to do school-work at home, not 
only on account of the possibility of injury to the body, but because it does not 
seem to me beSt for the mind. There is danger of the mind’s becoming jaded — 
from continuing too long at the same kind of work. It loses its interest in a 
subject; and the strength of will is not sufficient to hold the attention firmly ~ 
and habits are formed detrimental to concentration, that secret of success in all 
mental labor in later life. : 
There seem to me still other reasons why the teacher should not claim too~ 
much of the child’s time out of school hours. I recognize the fact that our 
children come from a great variety of homes. Surely, many of them have work 
todo athome. This is particularly true of our girls in the cities and of both 
our boys and girls in the country. This work is often manual training ofa val--  ~ 
uable kind ; and when there is not too much of it, it affords a healthful variety 
to the child. 
There are parents—andI do not want to think their number pitiably small—({if 
it be, our schools must have done lamentable work in the past and are responsib’e 
for miserable failure) who can advise good reading for their children, and who 
wish them to have some time for acquiring that taste for good books that is 
rarely acquired if not in childhood or youth. Some one suggested that our 
schools were doing this work in literature as part of the regular school work, 
The amount done in this line in even our best schools is pitiably small. What 
‘cultivated parents would be at allsatisfied with it? ‘We shall do well if we teach 
the children in our schools how to read a good book and then direct them to some 
good books. It is a noble thing to inspire a love for good books in the child who 
has no one at home to be to him an inspiration. To guide and inspire is the 
design of the “‘ Reading Circle for Children.” Shall we interfere with its good 
work by sending home so much spelling to be studied or so many problems to 
be solved ? 
The girls in our higher grammar grades must receive our special thought 
when we are considering this question of home study. We are either criminally 
ignorant or cruelly thoughtless if we do not give our girls special care at the 
transitional period of their lives. They so especially need plenty of fresh air, 
sleep, and all attention of those interested in their well being to keeping them 
free ftom anxiety and nervous feeling. Let them pass this period in safety, and 
they develop ints strong women, capable of a great amountof mental labor, and 
of wonderful endurance where love demands it. Of a bright and sunshiny dis- 
position, they scatter blessings wherever they go. On the other hand, if they 
are given work that curtails the time that ought to be spent out of doors, work 
that prevents their being sound asleep before the grown members of the house- 
hold, or worse than all, if they are worried about class standing or high per 
cents, they are apt to carry through life seeds of suffering that will render im- 
pozsible prolonged mental effort without serious danger, seeds of suffering that 
will make them break down under any severe trial or make them peevish and 
fretful or selfish and despondent. we

tional Association: I am satisfied that too much stress is laid cn results achieved 
by pupils and far too,little on the eXort and labor bestowed. One of the griev-

ous defects of our sytems of marking, rewards, and distinctions, is that it takes 
no account of earnest, conscientious effort, of severe, persistent labor. unless 
they have been successful. The dull pupils, those hampered by an adverse en- 
vironment, by want of preparation for work required, feel the injustice of such 
systems; to their other obstacles is added the discouragement of unappreciated 
effort. I insist that honest, hard work rank highest in all estimate of school 
work. ‘Let the student feel that work is the valuable thing to him in its results 
in achieving a real education. 
There is danger also that our improved methods, superior appliances, the pro- 
cesses of the new education.will insensibly infuse into the minds of teacher and 
pupil the fatal notion that there is an easy road to education, over level plains, © 
y the still waters, through rosy bowers; that the old, rugged road, up the hill 
Difficulty, with its briars and brambles, rocks and rough places, traveled with 
toil and sweat, has been abandoned. 
~ The schoolmaster of the olden time had one qualification worthy of imitation, 
he believed in and exacted work. 
Just so far as the improvement in processes, methods, and appliances have 
stimulated and facilitated work, so far as they have made a given amount of 
work effective, they are a positive good; so far as they supersede the necessity 
of work they are an evil. One must work out his education as well as work out 
his salvation. 
Vicious modes of recitation.—President E, B. Andrews, of Brown University: 
A vicious mode of handling your class will do very much to develop inaccuracy, 
more perhaps than a perfect curriculum can overcome. A recitation which is 
merely that, only a text to the pupil, embodying no instruction, is sure to pro- 
mote superficiality. There is a knack of reciting which many will acquire: a 
habit of mere glibness and parroting will follow, and the mind be turned away 
from real attainments. Here lies one of thé teacher’s chief temptations. We 
are forced to cherish rapid and fluent class exercises, because they save us time, 
which is so precious. We are thus beguiled into treating, if not considering, 
those as the best scholars whose tongues wag the fastest in the class. Next, our 
own ideas as to what arecitation should be become confused and faulty, the final 
result being that the appearance of attainments is substituted for attainments 
themselves, and that the pupil is actually aided by us to lose sight of his own 
real growth, only to be awakened, perhaps too late, when out in active life he 
is called to match himself with those trained upon a more thorough plan. 
Every day’s lesson an examination.—William A. Mowry, in Education: In pri- 
mary and secondary schools almost every day’s lesson is an examination, not 
merely of what has been prescribed to be learned for that special occasion, but 
indirectly and incidentally of all that has been taught before on the subject. It, 
is, in truth, the mark of a good teacher to keep a ‘perpetual informal review on’ 
foot, and +0 cause his classes to feel that any past acquisitions are always liable 
to come up in new connections. 
College entrance examinations.—President D. C. Gilman, in the Cosmopolitan: 
I believe that the day is coming when there willbea revision of our educational 
ereed, when the colleges will not make their entrance examinations such rigid 
tests of memory as they are now, but will contrive to make them tests of power. 
Is a boy capable of carrying forward the studies of the college? That must be 
found out. His capacity to retain and repeat what he has learned is one sign of 
his qualifications, but there are many others which anicer analysis may employ. 
The qualitative test is quite as important as the quantitative. Not the size of 
the brain, but its structure determines its worth. The possession of 10,000facts 
may distinguish an idiot, but an idiot gives no proper emphasis; he doesnot per- 
ceive the difference between the trifling and the fundamental. 
IX.—PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
A just medium can be secured.—President D. C. Gilman, in the Cosmopolitan: 
One of the first requisites of a good preparatory school is bodily discipline. 
This is partly to be secured by watchfulness in respect to posture, diet, repose, 
gymnastic, within the school walls: it is to be still further promoted by abun- 
dant exercise in the open air. Manly sports with the bat and the oar, running, 
jumping, bowling, swimming, rowing, riding, fencing, boxing, and, if possible, 
sailing, are all to be encouraged. Nor is military training to be underrated. 
The systematic exercise of every limb and every muscle is desirable, not under 
rules too rigidly laid down by the higher authorities, but under. regulations

spontaneously developed by the youth. It is generally conceded that just now, 
in England and this country, there is danger of intemperance in sport. This 
may be less disastrous than intemperance in drink or meat ; nevertheless there 
is such a thing asinebriety in athletic games. I do not refer to the danger of 
proken limbs and bruised faces, for they are rarely enduring injuries, but to 
the danger of unfair rivalries, of bad associations, of peculiar temptations in 
the anticipations and enjoyment of victory or in the depression of defeat, in the 
neglect. of other and higher scholastic duties, in the waste of time and money 
upon costly journeys, perhaps in extravagant hospitality. The boys themselves 
must be encouraged to correct these tendencies, but they have a right to expect. 
that we older boys will remind them of their highest obligations and encourage 
their fulfilment. With the reasonable control which players, teachers, parents 
can readily exercise, and which the young ladies and the newspapers might 
greatly encourage, the just medium can be secured, and athletics continue to be 
an essential factor in the training of American boys. 
The place of games in education.—James L, Hughes, inspector of Toronto pub- 
lic schools (Canada): In physical development, as in all other departments of 
~ human culture, the law holds good that the informal is better than the formal, 
giving asit does not merely greater power, but greater spontaneity and freedom 
also; so the games of the yard and field will be recognized as forming one of the 
most important departments of physical, intellectual,and moral training. New 
games will be devised by the highest medical councils of the world, in consulta- 
tion with the best minds in the teaching profession. Games may be improved 
without limiting the freedom and spontaneity of the playground. The games 
are really the best means provided in the schools of to-day for the exercise of 
the complete self-activity of the pupils; the only agencies for the full develop- 
ment of executive power ; the only school process that completes the essential 
sequence of feeling, thought, decision, action, in application to the threefold 
nature of the child. The educators will not continue long to be mad enough to 
leave so potent an educational agency as games to chance. 
Play, and plenty of it.—Principal George M. Grant, Queen’s University (On- 
tario): Physical development does not demand gymnasium apparatus or a drill 
sergeant, As arule children will see to this matter for themselves, in the best 
ways, if only opportunities are allowed. The games of children are, for the 
great mass, the very best means of securing good. physical culture. Play, and 
plenty of it, is indispensable in education. Play means harmonious development 
- of the body without fostering the self-consciousness that is apt to be induced by 
modern pretentious substitutes in the shape of military drill and gymnastic ex- 
ercises. 
There is no substitute.—Clara Conway, chairman of committee National Coun- 
ceil of Education: Any plan or system of physical training which gives no atten- 
tion to individual needs is defective. But here lies the chief danger, namely, 
that the lack of wisdom or skill in the use of apparatus may lead to serious re- 
sults. There is no doubt that ill-chosen or ill-directed exercise in the gymna- — 
sium is a cause of deformity. The frequent and prolonged performance of un- 
natural movements is a fruitful source of enfeeblement and nervous disease. 
There is fortunately a strong reactionary movement against excessive work in 
the gymnasium, and the wisest.are those who see that no movement they can 
‘ibe can take the place of free voluntary. out-of-deor exercise, in which the 
activities have full play and in which the emotion of pleasure is a strong ele- 
ment. The law of will must be in force, hence there is doubt if physical exer- 
cise imposed upon pupils under protest of the will can be effective. On the 
other hand, in dealing with nervous or overtaxed students care should be taken , 
to avoid exercise which requires sustained attention, and more still to avoid ex- 
cessive exercises, the results of which are as serious as those of overwork. 
The relation of mental to physical work.—Clara Conway, chairman of committee 
National Council of Education: The relation of mental and physical work is very 
close and vital, and yet in a careful study of the ‘question how to give at the 
same time work to the inactive mus¢les of the child and repose to hisover taxed * 
brain there seems to be akind of contradiction which makes the solution of the 
problem very difficult.. The conditions of the work are the same for the brain 
which thinks and the muscle which contracts, and in both these organs greater 
activity of function is accompanied by greater production of heat. In the la- 
borer and in the thinker alike there is an increased flow of blood toward the 
organ which works, and a greater vibration of heat within the active element.

1154 | : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. ? 
          In difficult gymnastics there isa strong exercise of the will, judgment, and 
other psychical faculties, and if there is economy in the expenditure of muscular 
force it-is at the expense of the nerves and the brain. Therefore, it is impossible - 
that the nerve centers gain repose under the influence of movements which ex- 
cite the whele nervous system. The overworked student requires economy of 
nervous energy, perfect repose of the brain, and rest of the psychical powers. 
A run in the green fields will free the mind and rest the head better than any 
system ever invented, because the head has no part in the lively exercise of run- 
ning. All thoughtful teachers with gymnasia at command have noticed the in- 
difference and apathy of intellectual students in the matter of difficult exercise. 
The reason is physiological and ought to be regarded. The tired brain makes 
strong and instinctive protest against an exercise requiring as much effort of   
    _ the brain as of the body. In every case of this kind the discriminating teacher 
will prescribe exercise producing muscular and not nervous fatigue. Exercises 
which have been long practiced and have been mastered are performed auto- 
matically and require no brain activity, while at the same time they quicken the 
blood current, regulate the respiration, and give tone to the digestive functions, 
There are conditions of mental sluggishness for which one remedy is the per- 
formance of physical exercises requiring the concentration of will power and 
sustained attention; no system of education is complete which ignores the fact. 
    
  - But for the overworked child help comes best from long walks with mother over 
the hills, from the old popular games, and, indeed, from anything rather than 
difficult gymnastics. 
The general principles of physical training.—Clara Conway (from the same report 
as the preceding): Our first duty as the guardians of the child is to see with all 
possible care that the growth of childhood be not disturbed or distorted by any 
influences adverse to nature. But how? By such a nice adjustment of mental 
and physcal work that one be not made to suffer at the expense of the other; 
by systematic daily exercise in order to acquire the aptitude. To this end we 
place walking first; well-selected games, second ; gymnastics, third. Walking, 
a3 a physical exercise merely, is a perfect exercise, because it taxes the whole 
system: every muscle, every nerve and fiber is brought into play. And when 
to this is added the interest awakened by the love of nature, a study of birds, a 
hunt for flowers, a search for insects, the temper is sweetened, the imagination 
brightened, the mind broadened, the spirit liftednearto God. It is something, 
says John Burroughs, to press the pulse of our old mother by mountain lakes 
and streams and knows what health and vigor are inher veins. 
Games. rank next. There seems to be a close relation between pleasure and 
high vitality or the vigor of the system, and between pain and the feebleness of ~ 
the system. Hence the law of self-conservation. But the games should be 
carefully selected. Girls and boys left to themselves in this matter make their 
choice without considering the importance of quality and quantity. Gymnas- 
tics have a value, too, which we must not underestimate in the general summing 
up; but in this day and generation, when the world is alive to the supreme im- 
portance of a healthy body and physical culture is the latest fashionable ‘‘ fad,” 
not many words are needed here. The first derived from the practice of gym- 
nastics, says an eminent physiologist, is the education of movements. The 
country boy, rough, clumsy, and uncultured, rapidly gains ease, grace, and 
polish. His muscles, hitherto used to slow obedience, learn to obey with rapid- 
ity and precision, and thus undergoa discipline to which they had been strangers. 
The gymnastic work, carefully done, gives strength, and strength gives confi- 
      _ dence. There isa way of standing, walking, and sitting, notonly easy and grace- 
ful, but requiring least expenditure of force. ‘‘Strength at the center and 
freedom at the surface” should be a precept of the gymnasium. ‘‘ Letsoul de-_ 
mand and body respond” should be another. Much of the work of the gym- 
nasium is reformatory or hospital work. Theré is a patient uprooting of phys- 
ical faults growing out of inheritance and out of environment and habits of life, 
and in their stead are established fine, graceful carriage, ease of manner, new 
and correct habits. Inthe hands of skill and wisdom the gymnasium is a power- 
ful means for the freeing of the body, until it becomes not only the fit temple 
of God, but the expression of his best thought. 
Should boys and girls engagein the same exercises? Dr. Sargent answers 
the question in these words: Up to 10 years of age any exercise that will be 
beneficial to a boy will be just as valuable to a girl. Between 10 and 14 girls 
should take lighter exercise, with more frequent intervals of rest. After that 
age it is simply a question of time, amount, and degree, rather than of quality. 
Asa general rule, he says, girls need more muscle, making exercise than they

  get, not so much for the sake of acquiring greater strength as for the influence 
it that well-developed muscles have upon the brain, nerve centers, and other 
parts of the system. For this reason many of the ’so-called calisthenic move- 
ments do not meet the demands of the female organism. They weary and ex- 
haust without giving anything adequate inreturn. These matters can safely be 
left to the judgment of a well-trained teacher. The corset should be taken off 
and kept off, or,what is better, never put on, in order that the body may be built 
up. with the new material that will come to it as the result of the. exercise, and 
to eliminate the old, broken-down tissue from the system. 
Should the schools be furnished with the apparatus of the gymnasium ? 
We answer that no gift in the power of the State is too rare or precious for 
the child in its keeping, and no expense too great for the process of preparation 
for American citizenship. If the eminent. ‘specialists, who are doing so much _ 
for the causes of physical education, will demonstrate beyond question their” 
ability and power—and we think they can—to remedy the evils of imperfect phy- 
sical organizations, then the State owes it to the child, through the school, not 
only to provide the necessary means, but to furnish aiso the teacher, wise by nat- 
ural fitness, and skilled by the best training of the schools. 
What system?    
     
                                                                                                                every system. 
Should not become a will training—W. T. Harris: I think that physical exer- 
cise ought not to be set as a task when it is intended to serve as recreation. It ~ 
seems to me thatit has been one of the great defects in physical education that 
it has been brought into the schools and made a will training, so that the child 
who has been exhausting his nervous energy all the morning at his lessons in 
school is then called upon to exhaust it even more rapidly in set forms of exer- 
cise instead of relaxing, as he oughtto. The child must stand up; he mustnot 
lean. He must pay strict attention and imitate precisely the motions pre- 
scribed. This is astrain on the will power, and calisthenics, as practiced in many 
cases, exhaust nervous energy faster than a class exercise in Latin or Greek. 
* * Now Iam a great stickler for the old-fashioned recess, the wild recess, 
the pupil bursting out of the schoolroom, running about, shouting, and pushing 
his fellows. It is this recass that recreates the pupil and restores his nervous 
energy. After the enjoyment of a little freedom and a run the child returns to   
the attention of the child are hurtful. * * * There is great danger in this 
matter of physical exercise of overstraining in certain directions and producing 
permanent weakness. When one looks at the danger of half knowledge in this 
matter, one is almost frightened. 
A vast problem.—G. Stanley Hall: If the object of the [physical] exercise is to 
increase the strength and physical development, it should always be when the © 
body is rested and ‘fresh. But if the object is divergence, in order to further in- 
tellectual work, it is a totally different thing. Then it should come when they 
are fatigued. Physical exercise is not one thing, but it is a great many things. — 
T do not think we realize what a vast problem itis, 
In case of fatigued pupils.—Clara Conway: I have frequently, in the school- 
room, seen pupils object to the physical exercise when the hour came, and upon 
investigation I find that the pupil is tired. In such a case I think it common 
sense that the pupil be allowed to rest, or sent outin the air and sunshine, where 
she may have the best rest. I think it would be cruel, I think it would be an 
outrage, to compel a girl to take physical exercise under those circumstances. 
On the other hand, I am not.prepared to state that physical exercise should be 
dispensed with. I believe in physical exercise, but if it is observed that physi- 
cal exercise is harmful it should be abandoned. 
There are times when physical exercise should be given to tired pupils who are 
mentally fatigued, and in that case it should be such exercise that the attention 
of the student is not required, and where no concentration of the mental faculties 
is necessary, but in which the exercise is merely automatic, 
Preservation of health a sine qua non.—G. Stanley Hall: Some of ushave pro- 
gressed to the point where we feel thatno system of education is beneficial if the 
young person leaves the schoolroom in worse health than he entered it.    
  The answer is brief. Any system that is good, or a combination of the best in <a

   X.—PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
Questions to be approached slowly:—Superintendent E. E. White, Cincinnati: 
The imperative need is that the people be educated, no matter where. If the 
private schools are imperfect they will be improved through the very necessi- 
ties of the case; the parents will not continue long to send their children to in- 
ferior schools. I think this compulsory education should be an English educa- 
tion; that American children should be taught the language of the country; 
and I do not see any difficulty in securing this in all public schools. We have 
had such a law thirty years in Ohio. Iam told that there are localities in some 
of the Western States where the instruction in the public school is not in Eng- 
lish. No one can object to stopping that; but the difficulty is in demanding 
that instruction in private schools shall be in English. This may be right, but 
“it brings an element into the question that gives trouble. In many private 
schools the teachers themselves can not speak English, and for that reason Eng- 
lish in private schools and the State supervision of private schools are ques- 
tions that I would like to see approached slowly. The people in most of the 
States are not yet familiar with the compulsory system. 
State authority over private schools—Governor H. W. Ladd, of Rhode Island: In 
a State so small and compact as ours it should be the aim to so systematize and 
correlate all our activities in this line as to be able, each year, to give an accurate 
and intelligent review of the whole field, and to show exactly what has been ex- 
pended, what has been accomplished, and what are the various channels through 
whichthe work has been carried on, with such details of the plans and methods 
employed as may be necessary to an intelligent understanding of the whole situ- 
ation. To this end the powers of the State Board should be enlarged to give 
them a definite connection with each and every educational institution carried 
on by the State; and they should also be clothed with authority to secure from 
each and every private school in the State such an annual return as shall show 
how many children are taught therein, and also what grade of instruction is 
given. These changes will at once place the board in a position to exercise its 
supervisory and directory powers with an effectiveness impossible in the present 
condition of affairs. Then, conclusions and recommendations will be based upon 
- complete and accurate information from every section of the State and from all 
grades and forms of instruction. 
How far the State may take cognizance of private schools,—Superintendent A. P. 
Marble, of Worcester, Mass.: A compulsory school law, then, implies that the 
State (which is only an organized form of public opinion) may take cognizance of 
private schools far enough to see that no child is deprived of that small amount 
of education on which the State insists; that is, ability to read and write in the 
English language, and a moderate knowledge of arithmetic and geography, for 
example. 
But so much of oversight is not hostility to private schools, nor any infringe- 
ment of parental control any more than the law requiring parents to-clothe and 
feed their children. On the contrary, such an oversight is a positive help to a 
private school; since parents would not patronize it if the children could not re- 
ceive certificates to entitle them to be employed, or if their children did not re- 
ceive a fair amount of education, suck as the law requires. 
The public-school authorities, if wise, would not undertake to inspect private 
schools in any other than a friendly spirit and for the purpose of learning what 
is indispensable for them to know. They would be received cheerfully, since all 
schools are presumed toaim at good education; and they would soon be welcome 
in making friendly criticism, And parents would not long patronize a school 
which refused to allow the public-school authorities to ascertain what is so im- 
portant for them to know, where the principle is acted on that all children have 
aright to a moderate amount of education. On any other principle than that 
outlined above, a compulsory school law—it would be better to call it a law for 
securing to each child his birthright of intelligence, since compulsion is a harsh 
term to American ears—on any other principle, such a law would be a dead let- 
ter; for if the school authorities can not inquire into the character of any school, 
then by means ofa fictitious school the law might be successfully and easily evaded. 
Examination of each pupil applying for acertificate is only an indirect and prac- 
tically very cumbersome way of inspecting the school which he has attended. 
Thisisnot amerely theoretical question. In my city a private or parcchial school 
for French children has invited with great cordiality an inspection for the pur- 
pose indicated above; and in afew instances certificates have been refused to 
children who had not acquired a knowledge of the English language. £

      PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. TT5 ts 
What the private school should be measured by.—F. W. Parker, Cook County 
Normal School: The work of all private schools of any kind, whether sectarian 
or secular, should be measured entirely by their direct influence for good upon Tag 
the common school, into which they will one day all be merged as soon as dem- ‘ 
ocratic growth demands that step. 
Status of separate schools in Ontario.—Hon. George W. Ross, minister of edu- é 
cation: The public schools of Ontario are undenominational. Fifty years ago 
the Roman Catholics were granted separate schools, and by amore recent act, : 
in settlements where a Roman Catholic population predominated and a Roman “ 
Catholic was employed as a teacher in the public schools, Protestants were 
allowed to form themselves into Protestant separate schools. These classes 
schools number as follows: Public schools, 5,380; Catholic separate schools, 
; and Protestant separate schools, 11. The department has not the same 
authority under the statute over Roman Catholic separate schools as it has 
over the public schools. Yet in the main features, such as the qualification 
of teachers, excluding those in religious orders, the selection of text-books, 
except those required for religious exercises, the authority of the department 
may be said to be the same. 
Transfer of parochial schools to school boards in. Minnesota.—Circular of State a 
Superintendent D. L. Kiehle (October 20, 1891): The transfer of parochial schools 
to the control of a board of education has deservedly attracted much attention, 
It is important as an experiment in uniting all American children in the system 
of state schools; actory to a large class of our fellow-citizens who have 
hitherto expressed great distrust of the influence of the public schools upon the 4 
religious character of their children; and also important in the possible danger 
of putting the public school administration in compromising relations with a re- 3 
ligious body. Therefore such an experiment requires on all sides a spirit of in- hy 
telligent confidence and entire frankness, It isin this interest and in answer to _ 2 
many questions that I call attention to such matters as may be helpful in study- ie 
ing and directing this e : 
1. The State has made ample provision fort he education of her youth. Itis 
her policy to make them satisfactory to her best citizens and helpful to them in 
their highest ambition in training their children for the duties of life. She 
therefore requires all the people to share the expense and desires above all else 
that all the youth of the State enjoy the advantages afforded. 
2. The attitude of the State is one of entire organic separation from religion a 
as represented in denominations; and she therefore requires that the distinctive 
work of the churches be entirely excluded from the public schools. ‘The lan- 
guage of the constitution is very explicit, and is as follows: ‘‘ But in no case 
shall the moneys derived as aforesaid, or any portion thereof, or any public 
moneys or property be appropriated or used for the support of schools wherein 
the distinctive doctrines, creeds, or tenets of any particular Christian or.other 
religious sect are promul. or taught.” (Article VIII, sec, 3.) 
To take this as showing indifference, or still more, opposition of the state to 
matters and institutions religious, is farthest from the truth, for in every way 
possible the state expresses the greatest interestin those religious bodies whose 
purpose, with that of the family, is to elevate and purify the character of the ” 
people. While the state must forego the exercise of authority in matters re- 
ligious, in order to protect the rights of all religious bodies, she speaks in no 
uncertain sound requiring that the principles of the purest type of morality be 
carefully inculcated in the minds and habits of youth. It is her purpose in the 
administration of her public schools to express the spirit of the ordinance of 
1787 for the government of the territery of the Northwest: ‘‘ Religion, moral- 
ity and knowledge being necessary to good government and thé happiness of 
mankind, schools and the means of education shall be forever encouraged.” 
So decided is this attitude of the state as the superior importance of character 
building that she allows to those of her teachers who fully appreciate their high 
calling all possible liberty in their choice of methods, i 
With this preface I proceed to define the limitations within which the public eA 
schools must be conducted.    
    
    
          
LIMITATIONS BY STATUTE. 
           A board of education may not lawfully bind themselves to require or apply 
any religious test in the selection of teachers; neither may they distribute or 
classify pupils in departments, grades or ‘classes, according to their religious
-P-A-G-E-566
          1158 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
faith. To do so could have no other explanation than the purpose to propagate 
' the tenets of a distinctive Christian sect. And what may not bs done directly 
may not be done by indirection; that is, the board may notoccupy the apartments 
-of a parochial school and have control of it with an implied or unexpressed un- 
derstanding that the teachers shall be selected from those of a particular reli- 
gious body, or that the children of a particular sect shall be sent there. Such 
an understanding must be regarded as sacredly binding by all honorable per- 
sons, and in the eye of the law and its enforcement at the bar of public senti- 
ment would be condemned as a violation of the law, and would therefore work 
a forfeiture of all rights to any share in the public funds. The board of educa- 
tion must be absolutely free in the exercise of its authority for the organization 
and conductof a good public school; and if the results are not satisfactory, the 
board must be able tosay that they were limited by implied conditions 
which the public understood and approved.         
  QUESTIONS OF EXPEDIENCY. 
Beyond limitations and duties determined by statute, there are many other 
questions which must be determined by the judgment of the board consistently 
with the purposes for which the school is maintained. Some of these have re- 
ligious elements and others have not. For example: 
1, The Bible is a religious book, and as such it has no place in the public 
schools to promulgate religious doctrines: but, having merit of great historical, 
moral, and literary value, it may be used for these qualities. If, however, to 
any class of persons this is obnoxious, the board should require the discontin- 
uance of its use. 
2. Sisters of Charity are religious persons, and as such have no place in the 
__ public school to propagate religious doctrine; but if they be women of educa- 
tion and teaching ability, it lies wholly within the authority of the board of 
education to employ them to.do the legitimate work of the school. If, how- 
ever, to any classof patrons their presence is obnoxious or unacceptable by rea- 
son of the significance of their religious garb, the board must either retire 
them or require them to wear the usual garb of teachers in the schoolroom. 
3. The same principle requires that in case the color, or nationality, or per- 
sonal peculiarities of a teacher, otherwise well qualified, make him so unaccept- 
able to patrons as to.interfere with the purposes of the school, his employment 
must be discontinued. 
4. While public funds and public property may not be used to propagate re- 
. ligious doctrine, the interest which the state has in all voluntary organization 
of a benevolent and philanthropic nature, has always disposed to allow such 
bodies any use of its buildings that would in ne wise interfere with their public 
use. Incountry districts ithas been customary from time immemorial to allow 
the use of schoolhouses for religious worship and Sabbath schools as well as 
other meetings. This practice is one of expediency and propriety, to be decided 
by the judgment of the beard. ,   
    
      THE FARIBAULT SCHOOLS. 
In view of the public importance of the action at Faribault, I have visited the 
schools there, and by the courtesy of the board of education and the city super- 
intendent, have become acquainted with the plan and purpose of the board in 
accepting the pupils of the parochial schools under their supervision. I feel 
warranted in expressing to the public my entire confidence that the board have 
acted intelligently and in no way comprise their authority as public officers; 
that they have used their independent and best judgment in the choice of teach- 
ers, in grading and promoting pupils, and that they are determined to give the 
children in these grades advantages equal to others of the city. 
This experiment, for such itis, is being conducted in such aspirit of consider- 
ation that if atthe end of the year the Catholics conclude to resume the educa- 
tion of their own childrren it will be done without disturbing the friendly rela- 
tions of mutual respect that now prevail.—St. Paul, October 20, 1891.     
    
XI.—PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Relation of the State to public education.—_From the message of Governor R. P. 
Flower to the New York legislature, January 5, 1892: Reportsreceived by the Superintendent of Public Instruction indicate that the number of children in the State of school age (i. ¢., between 5 and 21 years) in 1891 was 1,821,773. . 
     
-P-A-G-E-567
     4 
The number of children attending the common schools inthe same year was 
1,054,044. More than 767,000 children of school age therefore were either not 
in school at all or received instruction elsewhere than at the public schools. 
The proportion of public school children in 1891 consequently was about 57 per. — 
cent.of the total number between the ages of 5 and 21. The total cost of sup- 
plying this education to somewhat more than half the children of schoolage in 
the State was $20,269,118.29. The greater part of this amount was raised by 
State and local taxation. 
Considered with other statistics these figures suggest some serious reflec- 
tions. In 1851, forty years ago, 75 per cent of the entire school population at- 
tended the public schools. During these forty years the State has done much 
to improve and strengthen its common schools, to increase their efficiency and 
to compel attendance, yet during all that time there has been a steady decrease — 
of attendance in proportion to the school population, and nearly 20 per cent 
fewer children, proportionately, attend the public schools now than attended 
them forty yearsago. In the same interval the expense has increased from 
$1,884,826 to $20,269,118. For each pupil who attended the public schools any 
part of the year in 1851 the average cost was $2.26; in 1891 it was $19.22—the 
increase being 750 per cent. : 
If these‘figures are accurate, and they are based upon official statements and re- 
ports, they are startingly gestive. Iftrue, they mean retrograding infiuences 
_ and greatly increasing extravagance in management. Much of the increased 
cost per capita is undoubtedly explained by the erection of new school buildings, 
possessing greater facilities, better accommodations, and more attractive sur- 
roundings. But the surprising thing is that this sort of expenditure has not 
increased the proportion of children who avail themselves of these privileges, 
but has been accompanied by an actual diminution. Should the same ratio of 
. decrease in numbers and the same ratio of increase in expense be maintained, 
the State in a few years will be actually taxing its citizens many millions of dol+ 
lars each year—more than is ne2:ded now for all other purposes of government— 
to supply an education to a minority of its children. : 
This is neither democratic nor right. The State must, for its own protection 
and interests; see that the opportunities for a commo: hool education are of- 
fered to its children, but it will not be justified in raising large sums of money 
by. taxation for this purpose without accomplishing a corresponding amount of 
good. If there is waste in the present lavish expenditure it should be discovered 
and checked. If the present compulsory education law is not effective, and the 
evidence is clear that it is not, it should be strengthened by wise amendment. 
Certainly the State can not afford to permit thousands of its children to grow up in 
ignorance, only to increase that population which crowds our jails, our reforma- 
tories, and our poor-houses, and menace the integrity of our public service and 
our institutions with the weapon of an unintelligent ballot. 
No one believes more thoroughly in our common-school system than dol. It 
is the great hopper into which the untrained juvenile minds of Irish, English, 
Italian, German, Swedish, Bohemian, or American parentage, with their hered- 
itary ideas and tendencies, are tumbled together and shaken up toform thesub- 
stantial qualification of the American citizen. It is to the American ideas im- 
planted in our youth inthe common schools that our country owes her prosperity 
in the past and must look for the preservation of her institutions in the future. 
Every schoolhouse may be made a stronghold of defense against the spread of 
Socialistic and un-American ideas. No more worthy task therefore can be un- 
dertaken by the legislature than to strengthen and bulwark our common 
schools and make them centers of widening rather than diminishing influence. 
It will first be necessary, however, to ascertain the causes of the present unwel- 
come tendencies which statistical comparisons demonstrate. It may-be found 
that much of the proportionate falling off in general attendance (aside from that 
     
    
which is explained by the increase of private schcols), and certainly the increase © 
in expenditure, arise from the modern tendency to so enlarge the curriculum of 
the public schools that they at‘empt too much and involve the State beyond its 
proper measure of responsibility. Certainly advccates of higher education at 
State expense can expect little sympathy from lawmakers, when the State, even 
with liberal appropriations, seems unable to compel merely rudimentary in- 
struction, and thousands of children are growing up without any education 
whatsoever. Within the past two years the movement. known as ‘* University 
Extension” has assuméd considerable importance and great popularity in this 
country. Its nature I understand to be the bringing of means of culture and 
higher-education within the reach of persons who are unable to get a collegiate 
or university education, or, as it is more authoritatively described by one of its 
  e PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ~ : W159 =.

  prominent supporters, ‘*‘ The purpose of the university extension movement is 
to provide a means of higher education for persons ofall] classes and of both sexes 
engaged in the regular occupations of life.” Its methods are by lectures, class 
exercises and,examinations, conducted in various ‘‘centers” under the supervi- 
sion of a central head. zs > Ae 
The movement has caused great enthusiasm in England and in this country, 
and seems to have accomplished much good in stimulating intellectual tastes 
among the people. It has received the cordial support of mostleading educators 
and the generous encouragement of press and pulpit. While those who expect 
it, when fully developed, to fill the place of actual training in colleges and uni- 
versities are quite likely to be disappointed, there is every reason for believing 
that it will raiss the intellectual standard of the people and diffuse more broadly 
the benefits of higher education. With such purposes and aims every good cit- 
izen must be in cordial sympathy. 
Heretofore, however, university extension efforts have been carried on under 
the supervision of some established university, or of some association or society 
organized for the purpose. For instance, in England there have been four great 
moyvements—one under the direction of Oxford University, one under that of 
Cambridge University, one under that of the Victoria University, and the fourth 
under that of the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching. In 
the United States successful movements have been associated with the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania, later with the American Society for Extension of Univer- 
‘sity Teaching, with Brown University, with the New York and Brooklyn Soci- 
- ety for Schoo! and University Extension, and with other educational bodies or 
associations. < 
For the first time in the history of the movement, however, direct govern- 
ment aid and encouragement have been given, in the statute which was enacted 
by the last legislature of this State, authorizing the regents of the university to 
act as the central head for the promotion of this work and appropriating $10,000 
for their expenses. 
Inasmuch as this work is quite likely to be still further brought to your atten- 
tion and another appropriation asked for, I do not hesitate to express my opin- 
ion that the assumption of this duty by the State was not only unwise in principle, 
but that if the movement is as successful here as it has been elsewhere it will 
involve the State in unreasonable obligations and be a constantly increasing ob- 
ject of public expense. 
I am aware that it has been the policy of the State to encourage higher edu- 
cation, and that public moneys have been appropriated for that purpose, but I 
respectfully submit that before the State should enlarge its field of usefulness in 
that direction, whatever views we may have as to the propriety of that enlarge- 
ment, it should first perfect its system of common-school education. The al- 
Teady excessive taxation of the people for this latter purpose and the lamentably 
- inadequate results I have pointed out above. 
Reform is necessary before extension. 
My fears that, the State will eventually find the control and supervision of uni- 
_ versity extension an enormously expensive undertaking, wrong in principle be- 
cause it taxes the majority for the benefit of the few, and indefensible as State 
policy except under the broadest view of public welfare, are based chiefly upon 
the testimony of those who have been most closely identified with the new move- 
ment and upon the tendency of the movement where it has been longest tried. 
Thus far our State has committed itself merely to the obligation of meeting the 
expense incurred by the regents under their granted authority ‘‘ to codperate 
with localities, organizations, and associations in this State, where such educa- 
tion shall be desired, and to aid therein by recommending methods therefor, 
designating suitable persons as instructors, conducting examinations, granting 
certificates thereupon, and otherwise rendering assistance in such educational 
work.” The statute, moreover, expressly provides that no part of the appropri- 
ation shall be used in paying for the services or expenses of persons designated 
or appointed as lecturers or instructors, it being the intent of the act that such 
expenses shall be borne by the localities benefited. 
Yet if the State were to stop there the annual expense must be largely in ex- 
cess of the present appropriation if thé movement is to be successful, the ten- 
dency of every State commission or bureau being towards an increased expendi- 
ture. But will the State stop there? Experience and testimony in England do 
not give much encouragement of an affirmative answer to this question. Prof. 
R. G. Moulton, who is a Cambridge University extension lecturer, and who has 
been explaining the movement to audiences in this country, says in a published 
address: ;

: : 
‘‘We in England have tried, have ransack2d every form of contrivance in 
order to make the movement pay itselfi—I mean pay itself out of the fees and _ 
tickets of the students whoattend the lectures—and we have failed.” So general 
has been this failure in England that dependence has bzen largely had upon 
private benevolence and endowment, and now the promoters of the movement 
ar turning to the Government for financial assistance. In 1889 a national com- 
mittee was appointed ‘for obtaining a grant in aid of university extension.” In 
1890 the local taxation act gave permission to English county councils to apply 
acertain part of the proceeds of a tax on spirits to technical education under 
university extension courses, and one county aloae has this year appropriated 
£1,500 for this purpose. Even this indirect government assistance has not satis- 
fied the friends of the movement, however, and in June last, at a meeting at- 
tended by many prominent educators and others, it was resolved to petition for 
a government grant to properly organized local bodies for the conduct of uni- | 
versity extension teaching. This direct grant is desired not merely to pay su- 
p> ory expenses, but tomeet partof the costof teaching. Th2re seems every 
possibility that the governmentin England will soon be bearing the greater part 
of the expense of this movement. 
Is the prospect any better for.abstention from-seecking a larger shar2of govern- 
ment aid in this State, especially when the entering wedge has already been 
inserted? . 
Clearly it is not the intention of the promoters of university extension in this 
country to make it “‘ pay itself.” The American Society for the Extension of 
University Teaching says: ‘‘No great work in education along higher lines 
has ever been self-sustaining, in the ordinary sense of that term, and the society 
will be obliged to rely on the public spirit of all citizens, rich and poor, for 
funds to carry on the work.” A writer in the Popular Science Monthly for 
November last, after discussing the cost of the movement, says: ‘‘ The possi- 
pility of enlisting Goverment aid opens a larger question. University extension 
is a national movement which is intended to reach all classes and to promote the 
most vital interests of the nation. It has, then, aslarge aclaim upon the national 
pocketbook as any interest which the Government can recognize.” Even the 
regents of the university, in their extension bulletin, invite contributions to the 
movement, saying: ‘‘ While.the feeling seems to have generally prevailed that 
the funds of the State, raised by taxation, should not be used for the expenses 
of local work, however beneficent, and in that spirit the legislative appropria- 
tion in behalf of university extension was limited to general supervisory uses, 
still the cause of public education could be greatly advanced if it were possible 
to supplement and aid the work with judicious appropriations of money in the 
poorer and sparsely populated localit 
With such conditions prevailing further recourse to State assistance would 
not be unnatural, and I submit the question to your practical judgment whether 
it is wise for the State to continue to bear this questionable and in the future 
perhaps awkward responsibility. “ 
Thelimit of public free education—W. T. Harris: In America we explain our _ 
public-school system by saying that a nation of voters must be an educated na- 
tion. Where ignorance prevails, either an absolute monarchy is necessary to 
restrain the people, or else in case of a democratic form of government the 
demagogue will have the political control. We say that in a democracy each 
person is interested in the-eniightenment of all his fellow-citizens. In a mon- 
archy all the people are interested in the education of the monarch ; their wel- 
fare depends on his goodness and wisdom. Ina republic, where each is goy- 
erned by all, it is the interest of each that all shall be wise and good. 
Without education in literature, in science, and in history, the individual will 
be prone to superstition and intolerance. The selfishness of sectionalism and 
the selfishness of individuals will triumph over patriotism and personal integ- 
rity. Itis anecessity for us to see to it that our rulers, the voters, are en-— 
lightened by schools and other civilizing influences. 
This idea determines also the limit of public free education. Where the people 
are to obey laws made for them by an hereditary ruling class it may be necessary 
that the people shall be taught in the schools so much as will enable them to _ 
read and understand those laws. But where the people are to make the laws — 
as well as obey them, what limit can there be to the school education required 
except the full preparation of the individual citizen to carry on his education — 
for himself? ‘ 
No person completes his education at school. For the nature of spiritual life — 
is to be a perpetual education unfolding eternally. Man’s ideal is the divine-

the school can do, therefore, is to teach the individual how to carry on his educa- 
a tion by the aid of the printed page and the proper use of his social opportuni- 
ties. y 
Extent to which the authority of the State should be exercised.—State Superintend- 
ent A.S. Draper, of New York: Thelegislative power in our several States has 
been content to exercise very little general or decisive control over the schools, 
Provision has been made for schools, but little or nothing has been done by the 
lawmaking power to determine the character or direct the work of the schools. 
If you will examine the statute books of all the States of the Union with this 
_ matter in mind, you will stand amazed at the almost entire lack of enactments, 
directing what shall be taught in the schools, or insuring instruction by persons 
of sound character and established competency, and you will wonder, as [ have, 
that voluntary associated effort, unauthorized and practically unsustained by 
jaw, should have been able to accomplish what it has in the way of systematic 
- Now, suppose we take our system of public instruction as we find it, and in- 
quire what needs to be done to qualify it for the thorough and complete work 
which the developing circumstances of the country seem to require. I appre- 
_ hend we shall not differ widely in our conclusions, 
BUILDINGS AND APPLIANCES. 
In the first place, the whole subject of school buildings and grounds, furnish 
- ings and appliances, needs attention. The people fail to appreciate the moral 
and educational influence which a good house has upon the school. A comforta- 
ble, wholesome, attractive building is certainly a condition precedent to the best 
school work. Yet our cducational plan, the country over, leaves this matter 
wholly to the intelligence, the wealth, the generosity, the business thrift, or the 
poverty, the ignorance, the parsimony, the whims and caprices of local settle- 
ments. Does experience show that it may be safely left there ? In some cases, © 
yes. In more, no. In our largest and weathiest cities there is frequently lack 
of suitable school accommodations. Even at the popular centers buildings are 
found to to be out of date, badly worn and defaced, imperfectly warmed and ven- 
_ tilated, poorly lighted, deficient in furnishing, wanting in appliances to do with. 
And how is it in the country? How many towns and districts have school- 
houses and outbuildings unfit for any.use, houses which are a constant menace 
to health and morais, because of indifference, or because to build new ones_will 
increase the tax rate? How many lack proper seats and desks and blackboards, 
and globes and maps, and all the things which contribute to the efficiency of a 
school? Of course, this is not so in all places, but that it is so in some places is 
enough andtoo much. A chain isno stronger than its weakest link. Will any 
of us admit that anywhere in America a public schoolhouse should by any less 
comfortable and complete than the average American home? But there is an- 
other consideration. This matter does not rest upon sentiment alone. There 
is responsibility somewhere. When the public takes the children of the people 
into its keeping during six hours of each day for forty weeks of the year, it is 
pound to give them the best possible care. It is bound to make the environ- 
ment such as will promote the normal and healthful development of their bodies, 
while it cultivates their minds and hearts. Again, when the public maintains 
any building, it is bound to make it a model—one which will attract attention 
and cultivate cesthetic tastes, one which will stimulate a desire for improvement 
and lead out in the way of progress. 
Who of us does not know that the schoolhouses of the land do not in general 
come up to these standards? So long as they are wholly left to ward aldermen, 
village boards, or district school meetings, they never will. What reason ex- - 
ists, in law or in fact why the buildings of a public and common school system 
should not be subject to public and general inspection and supervision? -Why 
should not competent general authority inspect all the schoolhouses of the com- 
  -monwealth, and require that in size, manner of construction, condition and

PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
THE TEACHING SERVICE. 
If tho American school system is to successfully cope with the circumstances 
which confront it, and the still more trying circumstances which will confront : 
it, it must be equipped with a more substantial teaching service. Perhaps one 
feacher in five or one in four isa professional. The force is too largely con- 
stituted of young girls or persons who are unable to prosecute any other em- 
ployment successfully. Changes are frequent and constant. Two-thirds of the 
,number who are now teaching will have ceased to teach in five years. Four- 
‘fifths of the newcomers are immature, physically and mentally, and are inade- 
quately,prepared for such a trust. 
You may tell me that the law regulates this thing; that it determines who 
may teach in-the schools. It assumes to, but it doesnot. A law is good for ~ 
nothing that does not operate effectually. What does the law do? Ordinarily 
it confers upon city boards of education and county or district commissioners 
power to certify teachers. The members of the city board are not professional 
school men. How ave they to intelligently determine who are qualified to teach 
school ? But that is not all, nor isit the worst of it, for if itwas they could em- 
ploy a competent person to determine for them. They have the authority to 
employ teachers. They have aunts and cousins and daughters and nieces who 
want employment. And they also have personal and political friends with — 
retinues of relatives, friends and acquaintances. They are human. They like — 
to please. Only the strongest of them dare confront the misunderstandings and 
enmities in which a refusal to aid their friends will involve them. The greater 
number will use their opportunities to help those about them, even at the ex- 
pense of the school system. And how much of a breakwater is ‘the county com- 
missioner against immaturity and incompetency in the schools? He is nomi- 
nated at a political convention and chosen at the general election. He is under 
political obligations. If he does not pay them on demand, he is considered 
mean. The more honest and efficient he is, the more people there will be te en- 
gage in the enterprise of taking off his official head. He, too, is human, and 
he will ordinarily and almost necessarily be influenced by these comsiderations. 
But that is not all in hiscase. What reasonisthere tosuppose thatthecounty 
commissioner is competent to examine and determine who may properly teach 
in the schools? He may be, but there is nothing to assure it. Everybody is 
eligible to the office. The qualifications which secure it are the ability to com- 
pass a nomination and gather in enough votes at the polls. These are not ‘the 
qualifications requisite to the efficient administration of the commissioner's of- — 
fice. It would be as sensible to elect a man at a general election to manage ao 
railway or construct a cantilever bridge. 
There are no effectual statutory limitations upon the action of this commis- 
sioner. Possibly he may be required to certify teachers only upon examination. 
But what sort of an examination ? Except through the constant and strenuous 
exercise of the legal authority of the state superintendent, it may be onlyaform ; 
it may be conducted in the roadway. The world has no statutory guaranty of. 
its substantial character afd good faith. If experience in this connection has 
proved anything, it is that before an examination can be credited with any value 
-it must be held at a stated time, in a public place, upon papers which are pre- 
served, and by competent author: ity. 
Indiseriminate licensing must cease. The age at which a person may begin | 
teaching must be advanced. Professional training must be insisted upon when- 
ever practicable, and where not, then at least a minimum standard of intellec- 
tual qualifications must be attained at a stated public examination. Examina- 
tions must be in competent professional hands. The authority to certify and the 
power to employ must never be ledgedinthesame persons. The certificate must 
be gained before employment is legal. Teachers must be treated better and 
their rights must be more thoroughly protected. They must be paid as wellas 
equally qualified persons in other employments. Their tenure of position must 
be more secure. More men must be kept in the work. In short, a policy must 
be pursued, a plan must be devised, which will cause the teaching service to be- 
come broader, more substantial, more self-respecting, and equal to all the de- 
mands which may be made upon it no matter how exacting those demands may be. 
THE WORK OF THE SCHOOLS SHOULD BE DEFINED. 
Again, it seems to me, it is important that there should be an authoritative 
determination of what the common schools should do. The statutes are nearly 
silent in this connection. Thismatter is also left almost entirely tolocal author- 
 
-P-A-G-E-572
  “1164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
’ ties. We are living in times of marked activity, if not of feverish unrest. Ex- 
perimentation seems to be the order of ‘the day, and everybody has something 
new to propose. The schools do not escape these influences. Indeed, they re- 
flect any popular disposition or caprice moze quickly than any other of our pub- 
lic institutions. The result is indefiniteness and confusion in the public mind. 
This must be corrected or the end will be uncertainty and distrust. 
The authority to levy and collect taxes is a high goyernmental power. Itcan 
not be exercised capriciously. The purpose for which it is exercised must be 
clearly understood and the object to be attained must be of such transcendent 
_ -importance to all the-people as to unmistakably justify the proceeding. One 
- may properly gratify his fancy, he may speculate and experiment to his heart’s 
delight, with his own money. But he has no right to do so with the money of 
the people, That must be put only to uses which benefit all, and then it must 
be used in sufficient quantity, and in such a way as to accomplish the object in 
view. These trite propositions relate to public educational work as to any other 
public undertaking. < 
- Lapprehend there are certain things which the schools must do to justify their 
existence, that there are other things which they need not do and yet may do 
with propriety, and that there are still other things which they ought not be 
permitted to undertake, * * * 
The schools must be within reach of every home, and they must provide at 
least the fundamentals of an education to every child. They must put every 
child in possession of enough learning to enable him to act intelligently and un- 
derstandingly in his social relations and as an American citizen. They must 
train his mind to act for itself, and they must, at least, go far enough with the 
work: to enable that mind to stand alone and begin to walk on its own account. 
T entertain no doubt of the right and propriety of the support of high schools 
at common cost at the option of the qualified electors of each municipality. But 
there are evils resulting from the introductionof public secondary schools which 
need attention and which it will take time to correct. They attract public at- 
tention. ‘ney gratify local pride. They absorb the best teachers. Service in 
them is more remunerative and deemed to be more honorable than in the ele- 
mentary.schools. Their buildings are more magnificent, their equipment is 
more complete. Their curriculum rivals that of the best colleges thirty years 
ago, and what they do not feel justified in undertaking is not mentioned ineven 
the Sunday newspapers. In the minds of educators, in the public esteem, they 
too frequently overshadow and dwarf the necessary and essential schools of the 
rea'm. The educational pyramid had better stand upon its base and not under- 
take to poise upon its apex. The best building and equipment, the best teacher, 
the best methods, should be provided for the beginners. The most generous 
support and the most alert attention should be given to starting the multitude 
rather than to decking out and polishing off the individual. The relationship 
should be more evenly and nicely adjusted by law, and the great mass of pupils 
who never get beyond the grammar grades should have most serious consider- 
ation of thelaw makers and ofall interested in the well-being of the masses. 
There are some things which have no legitimate place in our educational work 
yet which wedge their way into it. The educational theorist outruns all other 
theorists. The educational philosopher reaches after the unattainable and dives 
into the unfathomable even more than other philosophers. Speculation is with- 
outlimits. There isno breakwater. He will suffer no layman to dispute him. 
He will speculate with other doctrinaires, and each will, in hisown estimation, 
get the advantage in the contest. Then he will insist on his distillations being 
condensed at public expense. Commonly they refuse to materialize atall. All 
changes and innovations crowd along tegether in the name of progress and re- 
form. The result is confusion and sometimes chaos. 
The waste of educational energy and effort in consequence of the speculative 
mania and because of the clashing of different interests is great. The cost is 
greater than necessary, if not unreasonably abnormal. At least there is no rea- 
son why better and more telling work should not be performed with the money 
at the disposal of the system. 
In my opinion this subject is one of presminent importance. The school sys 
tem must settle down and become a system in fact as wellasin name. Whenit 
does it will the more effectually perform the work expected of it, and it will 
disarm the critics or be the better-able to withstand the assaults which will be 
made upon it. It never will until competent general authority intervenes to 
define and limit the scope ofits operations, tosay what it must do in all places, 
_ what it may do in some places, and what it shall not undertake anywhere. 
 
-P-A-G-E-573
       PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 1165 
  COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
  T offer one more suggestion in support of my general proposition. After pro- 
viding the means to do with, after secur ing a competent teaching service, after 
defining the work which the schools shall do inorder to justify their existence 
at gen< ‘ral cost, it is imperatively necessary to exact the attendance of the chil- 
dren for a sufficient time to accomplish the object in view. 
Oi course, ifany parent prefers to educate his child at home or in a private 
school, no one can object, if this isnot a mere pretext and a sham, and if the 
education so provided is at least equivalent to what the public'requires. But 
the public has the right to know that it is equivalent and to exact information 
which will justify a public acceptance of its work. No responsible institution 
can have the least difficulty in establishing this fact. There is no other way of 
insuring general results, * * > 
We have legislated upon this subject, it is true; but we have legislated in a 
dilettante, milk and water fashion, which has been practically barren of results. 
There is almost an entire failure to appreciate the importance of the subjector 
how to meet it. Legislators fear that they may offend some one who has a vote. 
America is not to be the refuge and stamping ground of socialists and commu- 
nists and anarchists. It may ‘be well to hang bomb-throwers and murderers, but 
is is better to prevent boys from growing up into thugs and outcasts. 
Troublesome social disorders can be best met by early and alert legal regula- 
tions, and by none more effectually than by such as will bring all children under 
the instruction and discipline of the schools. The children of the depraved — 
and indifferent are the very ones whom it is most important we should reach, if 
we expect to accomplish the end we aim at, and justify the theory upon which 
we are proceeding. It can be done, but only through practical and stringent 
legislation. We ‘have had enough compulsory attendance laws with no one to 
execute them, and which no one could. execute; let us have some which will 
compel, and will provide that some one shall compel. : 
Now, these four matters which I have mentioned, viz, suitable buildings 
and appliances, a professional teaching service, a defined course of«study, and 
compulsory attendance upon the public schools, or upon other instruction of 
equivalent valve for a fixed time, are vital to the success of our educational 
plan, and the safety of a social compact based upon the principle of universal 
suffrage. 
Where is the authority which is competent to regulate such matters and in- 
sure decisive and necessary action? Itis notin the Federal Government. Our 
governmental plan does not cede the control of educational interests to the na- 
tional organization. It is not in county, or town, or district authorities. It is 
wisely and fortunately so, for many and obvious considerations. They are mere 
creatures of statutory law without original legislative or executive powers. 
The only authority which can act for this people i is the imperial Commonwealth 
of New York, through the law making power which sits at Albany. 
Functions of the State in relation to education.—President Seth Low, of Colum- 
bia University: It is every way becoming that the State, not the locality, should 
make the standard and should seo that the standard which it makes is\every- 
where upheld. The question becomes, in substance, the practical pertions 
what part of the work can the State do best, and what part the locality ? te 
would seem to be clear that the minimum standard should be fixed by the aie 
If any locality cares to carry its work beyond this general standard, that privilege 
may cheerfully be conceded. But the general standard certainly should be fixed 
by the State; first, because the State is likely to fix it mostintelligently; second, 
because only in this way can there be any uniformity of result, and third, be. 
cause when education is shaped with reference to the work which is to follow, a 
result which the State alone can secure, the best results are reached. * * * 
The scholar is threatened at every stage of his school life with an uneconomic 
use of his time, unless the steps of his progress be timed as well as directed by 
the best wisdom of the Commonwealth. There is always danger that the effort 
will be made to teach too much, to teach a smattering of too many things, in- 
stead of laying solid foundations broad and deep, and instead, above all, of teach- 
ing the pupil himself to observe and to think. I plead for an active oversight, 
at least, on the part of the regents, of the curriculum of every school in the pub- 
lic-school system of the State, I would have it a part of their duty to maintain 
such an oversight of the system in every locality that the results obtained in 
all places should measure up to the ideal, at least as well as the results in any 
other State; or rather, as a citizen of New York, I prefer to say, such an over-

sight that the results obtained in this great Commonwealth should be the recog- 
nized standard in all our sister States. It is not an idle dream, this ideal that 
there should be practical uniformity of results in all the schcols of the State 
of similar grade. Germany accomplishes it through the benign influence in 
that particular of the central government. The only question with us is, whether 
we will let the State, which is ourselves, do a similar work for us with similar 
efficiency. . 
There is another element in the problem besides the shaping of the curricu- 
lum and the oversight of the work, in which the voice of the State must be clear 
and decisive. It must define, and define adequately, the qualifications of the 
teachers in the various grades, and, if necessary, test these qualifications. Ido 
not mean that the State should in any way interfere in the actual selection of 
teachers. That by all means belongs to the localities who are to employ them. 
But the State should define the training and equipment which the teacher must 
have before he is eligible to enter any one of the public schools. Similarly the 
State might well fix the minimum educational requirements for the different . 
positions of responsibility throughout the schools. 
The General Government may stimulate public education.—W. T. Harris: It is clear 
that education is of vital interest to our form of government. The inhabitants 
of Mississippi have an interest in the education of the people of Pennsylvania 
because the voters of the latter State help to make laws which affect Mississippi. 
So Pennsylvania is vitally interested in the education furnished in Mississippi 
for the reason that Pennsylvania’s national interests are partly controlled by 
the votes of Mississippi cast for President and for Congressmen. 
Here is a text for a sermon on national aid to education and for national com- 
pulsory educational laws. But I trust that no person will draw the conclusion 
that we ought to adopt the centralized educational system of France, no matter 
how strongly he believes in the duty of the nation to look after education. Our 
doctrine cf local self-government tends to increase the directive power in all 
laces outside the cente: But this does not necessitate a ‘ let-alone” policy. 
‘or the General Government may stimulate local action by subsidizing it, or it 
may pass laws compelling a minimum provision for sthools. 
The limit of the function of the State.—Jas. P. Monroe, in the Educational Re- 
        _view: Once having established the machinery of free schools, once having placed 
proper safeguards for its maintenance and protection, the State should deter- 
mine the least that it must do to preserve its integrity and provide for its healthy 
growth. It should then rightly exclude from the school all that belongs to the 
arent as well as all that, being nonessential to the life of the State, ought tobe 
eft to individual effort. : 
Mischievous interference with the schools.—Educational News: Unfortunately for 
the poor teacher, nearly everybody, from the chief officer of a city or otherschool 
district, down to the man who drives a garbage cart, believes that he knows 
better how ‘to manage the children and conduct a school than do those who 
have made it a life work, and for this reason both individuals and organizations 
offer their uncalled-for criticisms and push their mischievous interference. 
Oh, for something for idle hands to do! The idle child is the mischievous 
child in school; he is also the mischievous child at home. Keep him busy and 
you are safe. But what shall we do with the idle man? It is he who concocts 
the mischief of the neighborhood.. It is he who says ‘‘they say” and destroys 
men’s reputations. It is he who too often is the critic of our educational work, 
and while he lounges on the store boxes of the village can tell just how the 
school ought to be kept and where its greatest weaknessis to befound. Is there 
no plan by which this man can put the energies to work in profitable channels? 
How much better our schools would succeed; how much better off the whole 
community would be if we could only keep the idler busy! 
Also this from across the water, same subject—Revue Pédagogique Belge: For 
ages, the progress of school education was retarded by general indifference; to- 
_ day, on the contrary, the most formidable obstruction it encounters is the itch, 
or the passion, for innovations. In all countries, monarchie and demccratic, 
everybody, from emperor to pastry cock, has upon the subject of education ideas 
which in his view will regenerate humanity. Naturally, the ministers of public 
instruction have their ideas too, and endeavor to put them into practice. Al- 
most every one wishes to break away from what he is pleased to call the old 
usages, that is to say, from the experience of centuries, and to build up the course 
of study on a new basis. The lack of practical experience causes pebple to get

astride of some of the strangest hobbies. One is wholly engrossed with gymnas- 
tics, another with chemistry; this one is inflexibly bent upon teaching anatomy 
and physiology to future seamstresses, that one is of the opinion that the youth- 
ful residents of the Rue du Temple will not be able to get along without some 
well-grounded knowledge of farming. Z . 
With the best intentions in the world, they would (in Paris) have turned the 
courses of study topsy turvy a score of times, and have completely ruined the> 
public school instruction, if they had not had to moderate and guide them the™ 
learned and unpretentious Académie of Paris, with its inspectors and its active 
and energetic rector, M. Octave Gréard; 
So, while no really useful innovations in the course of study, the methods, or 
the text-books, have been rejected, the literary basis upon which elementary in- 
struction was founded, has been wisely retained.   
  
The school of the future will not usurp the functions of the parent.—Superintendent 
A.P. Marble, Worcester, Mass. The school, having undertaken to train the in- 
tellect of boys and girls, is now quite generally expected to take entire charge of 
their education, intellectual, physical, and moral. This is beyond the original 
contract, and if so broad and general an end is to be attempted, then time must 
be given to enlarge the plant, to reorganize the system, and adapt it to such an 
aim. 
If the school of the future is to take of the parent, and attend to the entire 
training of children—to be responsible for bodily health, intellectual train- 
ing, and moral culture, if the duty of parents is to cease when once the child is 
old enough to enter the kindergarten, and the school is to turn him out fully 
equipped for the battle of life, and for entrance into a blissful hereafter, then we 
must have a good deal more time and more funds. It would seem as if so broad 
an aim would need to include dormitories, clothing, stores, and refectories. 
Such was the Spartan scheme of education. It is not likely to be repeated. It 
is not desirable. Nothing of a publicand institutional nature can supply the place 
of parents. . They were ordained of God; and no incubator of modern science or 
education should eversupplantthem. The duty of rearing and disciplining their 
children ought to be thrown back upon them to the largest possibleextent; any 
‘ institution or any school which tends to beget in the parental mind a feeling of 
irresponsibility is evil and only evil, and that continually. The school of the 
future will not usurp the functions of the parent. 
The aim of the school.—Principal George M. Grant, Queen’s College (Ontario): 
‘We must remember that the object of the common school is not industrial. It 
should not regard children as the raw material of craftsmen, and aim at making 
infant mechanics. Children are organisms in the flower of life, and the best 
fruit will ke had if you give the flower free play and do not expect it to be fruit. 
The fruit will come in due time, if you do not handle or test the flower too often, 
The aim of the school is to make children happy, healthy, and natural ; to 
give them a love for their country and for one another; to open their eyes to _ 
the beauty of nature and the meaning of life; to give them a love for reading, 
and a taste that will enable them in some degree to discern good reading from 
bad; and to form in them habits that will make the end of their school days to 
be but the beginning of their education. It may be said that all this and more - 
too is being done now. Possibly it is in some places. Improvement, too, there 
has been of late years, in the general diffusion of education and educational ap- 
pliances, and, above all, in the increase of popular interest in the common ~ 
school. But no one will say that the influence of teachers or society, or the in- 
fluence of school on the formation of character, is what was at one time hoped 
for; and how, then, can we profess to be satisfied ?_ Unless the people are be- 
coming more intelligent and more moral, the school has failed. Unless there is 
a higher political life the state can not be satisfied. So great are the possibili- 
ties of the public school, however, that despair must not be thought of. 
What socialism in education tends toward.—James P. Munroe, in the Educational 
Review: If the State, that nonentity for which each one of us and therefore none 
of us is responsible, is to bring up my children for me; if morality, good man- 
ners, and the domestic virtues are to be taught by some one else while I am but 
to provide the material things of life; then, forsooth, I will lay aside such sums 
as may meet these temporal wants and with the balance, large or small, will eat, 
drink, and be merry; for surely I have no better use in the world. The fact 
that in a few generations the State will fall to pieces is not for me to consider, 
since 1 am credibly informed that the sacred duty of maintaining it is taught in 
the schools. This wicked and absurd result of socialism is, of course, extreme. 
       
-P-A-G-E-576
      EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90.    There ate, fortunately, human tendencies retarding such a mad career as this. 
Of these are avarice, making us save even when there is no direct .motive for 
saving; family pride, unwilling to resign the task of chaping its heirs; and 
~ above all, parental love, refusing to deny itself to its offspring. 
    What the public schools can and can not do—kindergarten training.—State Super- 
intendent A. S. Draper, of New York: The business and industrial world is in 
aferment. The educational world is no less so. All manner of schemes are on 
foot. Everything is expected and demanded of the schools. Specialization 
and experimentation are the order of the day. The schools are sympathetic 
with this spirit. In my opinion there is danger init. 1tis a tendeney which 
is to be resisted. The schools can not specialize. They can not undertake 
to fit a child for any particular field of labor for they can not cover all the 
fields. They can not teach him all heisever toknow. They can arouss his 
faculties. They can give him the elements of an education upon whith he can 
build for himself and they can stimulate his ambition so that he will want to 
build for himself. If they do this they will do much. This much will not be 
accomplished if the schools attempt to do special things or if the work of the 
schools is allowed to become involved in uncertainty and confusion. 
In so many cas2s as to be practically universal the child will remain in the 
school but a few years. He may be expected to withdraw at any time. Then 
the most scientific and painstaking work must be done in the first years. If 
there is unusual care or large exp2nse it must be there. The idea that persons 
of little learning or who are without professional training can teach the young- 
est children, must be discarded. The greatest expertness must be placed where 
it will reach the greatest numbers and perform the best and most lasting work. 
We must proceed as though each year may be the last in which the child will 
have the benefit of the schools. 
The child is to live in contact with affairs. He is tolive by his hands and his 
eyes as well as by his ability to reason. His value as a citizen and his success 
_ as aman depend as much on his ability to do as on his ability to think and per- 
haps as much on his sense of right as on either. 
‘Then he is to ba educated practically. He is to be taught to put his hands and 
his eyes to their best uses. More than this, he must be disciplined. His moral 
sense must be aroused. He must be brought into sympathy and harmonious 
relations with nature and with affairs. Wecan not neglect this until we arrive at 
the age at which children may advantageously handle tools, and then expect to 
accomplish much. Something must precede the handling of tools. Half the 
children will have left school before that time. A carpenter shop connected with 
_ a high school is a feeble thing with which to bestow a practical education upon 
the children of a sizeable city. But the kindergarten will doit. It is at the 
right end of the course. It may reach-every child. It harmonizes with the 
other work of the school. Childrenlove it. It lengthens their time in school. 
Otherwise its results are extraordinary. It arouses an interest in natural ob- 
jects, as stones and trees and animals. It cultivates social amenities and as- 
serts mutuality of rights and obligations. It quickens the moral sense. It 
sharpens the observing and perceptive faculties. It forms and develops the 
constructive powers, lt cultivates the esthetic taste. The laying of straws, 
the weaving of mats, the folding of papers, the blending of colors, the molding 
of sand and the modeling of clay, train the eye to exactness and the hand to 
deftness at an age when such training is effective and influences the whole after 
4ife, If beyond this children are taught obedience, punctuality, neatness, some 
knowledge of themselves, if they are taught to spell correctly, to speak gram- 
matically, to write legibly, to read understandingly, if they are taught the fun- 
damental principles of mathematics, and if it is done in a cheerful way so that 
the teacher will be looked upon as a friend and helper, the public schools will 
have met measurably the responsibility resting upon them. If the attendance 
can be general and regular the schools will make the citizenship of the State 
industrious, well-disposed, and safe. 
        
  
XII.—READING AND LITERATURE. 
  
Classical literature the basis for ethical training.—President Charles de Garmo, of 
Swarthmore College: The advantage of the classical, imaginative literature for 
the young is that it portrays the ethical lessons of life in a form that most pow- 
erfully appeals to the child’s natural interests. To many itisa familiar thought 
that the stages of a child’s mental development correspond to the stages of cul- 
ture through which the world has passed.. If this is true, as it must be in some 
  
-P-A-G-E-577
      
READING AND. LITERATURE. AL69    sense, then thoughtful experiment with classical’ literary forms will enable us 
to find that best adapted to any given stage of childdevelopment. Alleducation 
is a process of attaining intellectual and moral freedom. ‘The true fairy talenot 
only embodies an ethical truth, but it frees the puny child from the iron bands 
of time and place and circumstance. The child of penury may dwell in marble 
halls with princes of the blood and eat the food of the gods. Mrs. Burnett has 
beautifully illustrated this power of the imagination in ‘‘Sara Crew.” The curly- 
headed lad at his father’s knee may quickly become thearmed hero, doing mighty 
deeds for the right. This emancipation from the physical limitations may soon 
be transformed to the moral field. I have said that it is the mission of literature 
to enable the individual ideally to pass through the experience of the race with- 
out-the pain that the original experience cost. What a weary round of scsurg- 
ings the race has gone through to arrive at its present state of material, political, 
and ethical freedom! All this is portrayed figuratively in literature, and liter- 
ally in history. The child is born,now, as ever, with all his experiences before 
him. Must he, for the lack of education, tread again the thorny path of his race? 
We do not ask it with regard to his material or intellectual welfare; why should 
we with the moral? Shall we not rather portray the inevitable struggle in forms 
that he can understand, teaching him to win the victory before the battle is 
fought. : 
The basis for ethical training in elementary education is to be found, there-— 
fore, primarily in a graduated course in classical literature, beginning with fairy 
tales, myths, legends, and folklore, and culminating with the higher dramatic _ 
‘literature; and secondarily, in the concrete biographical and narrative elements 
of history. 
The best literature for childven.—Principal George M, Grant, Queen’s University 
(Ontario): The difficulty of teaching literature to children is very great, perhaps 
greater than of teaching history itself; and the usual mistake is in being too 
formal, too didactic, too analytic, and too ambitious. The children must be in- 
terested only through their imaginations. Mr. Gradgrind would give them 
“facts.” I would give them stories and tales instead—books like Hans Ander- 
sen’s and Grimm’s tales, the Arabian Nights, Robinson Crusoe, and the Synop- ~ 
tic Gospels, to begin with, to be followed by Scott’s poems, selections of ballad 
poetry and selections from Scripture. ‘‘ The best literature for children from 
their seventh to their fourteenth years,” says Rosenkranz, ‘‘ consists always of 
that which is honored by nations and the world at large,” and if the books [have 
mentioned are objected to, choose at any rate others that have stood the test of 
time anda jury that may be said to comprise universal humanity. 
Should not anatomize in teaching children literature.—Miss N. Cropsey: A vast 
amount of time is wasted by presenting the common and the crude in reading 
and literature, because we fail to understand the poetic spirit in which the child 
interprets the world. It isnotnecessary to know the exact meaning of each word 
in a poem in order to be instructed and inspired by its general sentiment. The 
world comes to us first as a general impression; it may be dim and obscure; 
its diversity is interpreted inrelation tothiswhole. Our primary schools ought 
to teach the best that literature has to offer, not the most complex or the most 
obscure in meaning, but some expression of other than the literal and disconnected 
view of things. s 
The analytic processes may entirely absorb the time of the child in school, 
and completely obscure his poetic view of the whole which he brought to us out 
of the land of early childhood, leaving him on a barren plain of facts, cut off _ 
from the living spring of imaginationand reason. The eye of the poet integrates 
the parts and feels the living spirit which animates and unifies nature, though 
he may not be able to give a scientific classification of its forms. x 
He will get much more than we imagine.—Intelligence: Reading should be en- 
couraged with the earliest ability of the child to read, and continue through all 
his public school career. There is slight danger of the child reading beyond 
his depth. What if he does not seize all the thoughts if he only begets a taste 
fer ennobling literature? He will get much more than we imagine, and will 
grasp it with a firmness we little suspect. 
The teaching of English literature.—The following remarks upon the methods 
of teaching English literature were written by a graduate of the Worcester 
(Mass.) Norma! School and read by Hon. A. P. Marble at a meeting of the New 
York State Teachers’ Association : 
, lf lam to teach literature to a class of boys and girls, I must have my target, 
justas truly as the child with the bow and arrow in his hands must have his. I

_ must know at what my teaching is aiming, or I shall be as likely to fire into the 
_ ground as at the stars. € 
T begin with the hypothesis that literature is to be studied in our high schools , 
as a form of culture and education beneficial to our growth, though, it may be, 
not directly helpful asa preparation for bread-earning. If one were to ask a 
class of boysand girls, after ayear’s study of literature, in what way they expected 
to use their knowledge, I imagine he would get some such answers as.these: “T 
shall ba able to make a great many pat quotations.” ‘‘T shall be able to talk on 
literary subjects.” ‘I shall beable touse betterlanguage.” ‘Ihave gotstartad 
in reading and in thinking for myself ;” or, perhaps, ‘‘ I don’t supposel shall ever 
use it at all.” \ 
These answers, with exception of the last, are reducible to two purposes: 
To show off what one has accomplished, and to be able to accomplish in the 
future. 
Tf one’s education is to be only an end, and not ameans to something further, 
it is a poor thing to waste fifteen years of work for,and not usually worth trying 
_ toshow off. It is what one is, or is able to become as the result of the work he 
has done, rather than the exact measure of knowledge he has gathered together, 
that is of value to him. Things plastered upon the outside of a person soon wear 
off and show the old texture through. -That which is taken in as agerminating 
foree, fostered and helped to grow, changes the very fiber of the mind, and makes 
it able to be and to produce taat which it could not have been or produced other- 
wise. 
/ The activity of the mind is of course thought. And just in proportion as we 
ean increase the thoughtfulness, the habit of thinking deeply andindependently, 
nn that proportion can we give vitality and strength to the intellect of a 
outh. 
= Young people think, of course. But what about? Take a class of boys and 
irls 15 or 16 years old. What sort of thoughts are making themselves'at home 
_ in their minds, to order their affairs? There is the last ball game, the tennis 
match, the new spring dresses, the next dancing school, endless novels, with 
many tedious school books from which to economize. time for more interesting 
things. Here is much thinking, but little thought. Much of ita very health- 
ful kind of thinking, but not just the kind that is going to bring them out,men 
and women, intellectually wide-awake, serious, and clear-sighted, the kind of 
men and women we need. 
Take this class of young people and get them deeply interested ina play of 
Shakespeare. The plot itself can be trusted to get their interest. Then just 
make those characters live to those boys and girls; and if Iago and Othello, Mac- 
beth, Portia, and Hamlet do not teach them some lessons about themselves and 
their relations and duties to their fellow-men I am greatly mistaken. 
Make them hear alittle of the music of Milton, entertain them-with some of Dick- 
_ ensand Scott, get them up to their ears in discussions over the philosophy of 
~ Ralph Waldo.Emerson. In each case pick out the great gift, the leading char- 
acteristic of a writer, and just make that one point tell on the thoughts of the 
pupils. Above all things, do not discourage the pupils from making their own 
comments and expressing their own opinions. They will often seem ridiculous 
to the teacher ; but youth isthe time to beridiculous, and mistakes are the surest 
way to correct ideas. . 
Would I have them learn quotations? Certainly. Things committed to mem- 
ory are seen in the many different lights of after reflections, while a thing read 
once has but the light of a passing mood. . 
But committing to memory should not be the chief work of a class, and pupils 
should be tempted and praised, rather than driven and scolded, to quotation- 
learning. 
It is very common, too, I think, in the study of literature, to require a pretty 
full biographical account of the life of each writer studied. This would do’very 
- well for a psychologist or a philosopher, or even for a man of mere general cul- 
ture, provided he were 60 years old. And so with long criticisms and books 
about books; they are well for the writer of 40. But give these young boys and 
girls the works of great men, pure and simple, and let them feed on them and 
grow mentally and_morally. 
_. Inmy opinion it is better, too, not to include very many writers: in a school 
_ literary course. Just as it is better to have a good talk with one. intellectually 
    great man than to have an introduction to 40, so it is better to know 1 poet than _ 
to know 40. To study literature and to study the history of literature are two dif- 
ferent things, and they should not be exchanged for one another. But the life — 
is in the literature, not in its history. EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. as

         Religion in education.—Brother Azarias: Religion is sacred, and because it is ~ 
so sacred a thing it should not be exeluded from the schoolroom. It is nota 
garment to be donned or doffed at will. It is not something to be folded away 
ea€fully as being too precious for daily use. It is rather something to beso 
woven into the warp and woof of thought and conduct and character, into one’s 
very life, that it becomes a second nature and the guiding principle of all one’s 
actions. Can this be effected by banishing religion from the sehoolrcom? 
Make religion cease to be one with the chiid’s thoughts and words and acts— ° 
one with his very nature—at a time when the child’s inquisitiveness and intel- 
leetual activity are at their highest pitch; cause the child to dispense with all 
consciousness of the Divine Source of light and truth in his thinking; eliminate 
from your text-books in history, in literature, in philosophy, the conception of 
God’s providence, of His ways and workings, and you place the child on the way 
to forget, or ignore, or mayhap deny that there is such a being as God and that ~ 
His providence is a reality. The child is frequently more logical than the man. —/ 
If the thought of God, the sense of God’s intimate presence everywhere, the 
holy name of Jesus be eliminated from the child’s consciousness and be forbid- 
den his tongue to utter with reverence in prayer during school hours, why may 
not these things be eliminated outside of school hours? Why may they not be 
eliminated altogether? So may the child reason; so has the child reasoned; — 
and therefore does the church seek to impress upon it indelibly the sacred 
truths of religion in order that they may be to it an ever-present reality. 
Not that religion can be imparted as a knowledge of history or grammar is 
taught. The repetition of the catechism or the reading of the gospel is not re- 
ligion. Religion is something more subtle, more intimate, more all-pervading. 
It speaks to head and heart.” It is an ever-living presence in the schoolroom. 
It is reflected from the pages of one’s reading books. It is nourished by the 
prayers with which one’s daily exercises are opened and closed. Iteontrols the 
affections; it keeps watch over the imagination; it permits to the mind only 
useful and holy and innocent thoughts; it enables the soul to resist temptation ; 
is guides the conscience ; it inspires a horror for sin and a love for virtue. - The 
religion that could be cast off with times and seasons were no religion. True 
religion may belikened to the ethereal substance that occupies interstellar space. 
This substance permeates all bodies. There is nomatter socompact that it does 
not enter, and between the atoms of which it does notcircylate. Evensoshould ~ 
it be with religion. It should form an essential portion, of our life. It should © 
be the very atmosphere of our breathing. It should be the soul of our very ac- 
tion. We should live under its influence, act out its precepts, think and speak® 
according to its laws‘as unconsciously as we breathe. It should be so intimate 
a portion of ourselves that we could not, even if we would, ever get rid thereof. 
This is religion as the church understands religion. Therefore does the chureh 
foster the religious spirit in every soul confided to her, at all times, under all 
circumstances, without rest, without break, from the cradle to the grave. Place 
yourself, at this point of view, and say, if believing all this, child of yours 
should receive any other than a religious education. 
How piety can not and can be taught.—Carlyle ; Piety to God, the nobleness that 
inspires a human soul to struggle heavenward, can not be‘ taught” by the most 
exquisite catechisms or the most industrious preachingsand drillings. No; alas, 
no. Only by far other methods, chiefly by silent, continual example, silently 
waiting for the favorable mood and moment, and aided then by a kind of miracle, © 
well enough named “‘ the grace of God,”*ean thatsacred contagion pass from soul 
intosoul. How much beyond whole libraries of orthodox theology is, sometimes, 
the mute action, the unconscious look of a father, of a mother, who had in them 
“devoutness, pious nobleness !” in whom the young soul, not unobservant though 
not consciously observing, came at length to recognize it, to read it in this irre- 
- fragable manner—aseed planted thenceforth in the center of his holiest affections 
forevermore. 
Can morality be taught in. our public schools apart from religion and theology ?— 
Nicholas Paine Gilman: The great facts and the main laws of the moral life are 
obvious to all mature men and women; certainly they are not dependent, for 
their clearness and their binding force, upon any notions as to the origin either 
of the universe, of mankind, or of the pérception itself of these facts and laws. 
The facts of astronomy which affect men’s daily life—such as the so-called rising 
and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, and the phenomena of the ocean

  ALI2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. - : 
tide, for instance—are plain to every one; the explanation of them given by the 
astronomer to the farmer and sailor, whether correct or not, will not essentially 
. change the arts of agriculture and nay igation. So the common practical duties 
of human beings have long been familiar. Hach new generation must learn 
_them afresh, indeed, but it learns every day morality as an art, not as a science. 
The difficulty lies in the practice, notin the theory. Philosophers may disytite 
as to the exact reason whya man loves or should love, his mother; but the duty 
of loving one’s mother is not a question considered open to discussion in com- 
mon life. ‘The same may be said of the other obligations which make up the 
substance of their duty for the great mass of mankind, in all but exceptional 
times and situations. 
When, then, we have in mind as a subject for public school instruction, not 
the science of ethics, not the speculations of moral philosophers, but the orderly 
presentation of the common facts and laws of the moral life which no one in his 
senses disputes, we perceive how the religious or theological difficulty at once 
disappears, toa large degree. There is possible a theistic explanation of the 
moral law; there is s possible an atheistic explanation; but thers is a,third course 
open here to the common-school teacher—to attempt no such final explanation 
-atall. It is not necessary for him to teach that morality rests wpon religion as 
its ultimate foundation; it is just as unnecessary for him to teach that religion, 
on the contrary, reposes upon morality as its basis. Letthe relation of religion 
and morality be as itmay be; the teacher is not called upon to decide an issue of 
this magnitude. He can teach the duties of ordinary life, showing their reason- 
ableness and their interdependence in a consecutive, orderly manner, without 
appealing to religion; he can use the plain and usual consequences of actions, 
good or bad, as reasons for morality, without being open to a just accusation of 
peenethns These consequences, as he shculd teach them, are admitted by 
a 
Such a limitation bars out all matters of theological controversy. The secta- 
rian difficulty and the religious difficulty in moral education disappear when 
we keep to conduct and its common laws, and stop short of theological or phil- 
osophical explanations why right is right or wrong is wrong. 
General method of moral instruction in public schools.—Nicholas Paine Gilman: 
The one principle to keep firmly in mind is to avoid didacticism (‘‘ preaching”) 
- as much as possible, and to hold fast to actual life as children already know it, 
or may be led to comprehend it. Concrete instances of right-doing or wrong- 
doing, happening in the scHoolroom itself, or just outside, within the immediate 
knowledge of the boys and girls, afford the best starting point for talks about 
the moral points involved. It will be easy to bring the children’s minds, through 
consideration of actual examples, to recognize in some degree the general prin- 
‘ciples involved. The same caution needs to be ur ged here as in the case of other 
-general notions, against haste and consequent disregard of the immaturity of 
the childish mind. But if the teacher will shun formality and generality, and 
keep mainly to the particular and the concrete, he will find that few subjects 
interest children more than these questions of right-and wrong in common con- 
duct. These men-and-women-to-be find people the most attractive matter, just 
as they will find them later in life. Man is not only the ‘‘ proper,” but also the 
  - most engaging ‘“‘study of mankind,” large or small. Conduct isto children, who 
have not yet entered upon the great activities of business, art, or science, much 
more than ‘‘three-fourths of life,” and the lines of it on which they are- begin- 
~ ners will continue unbroken through all their years. Elaborats casuistry, hair- 
  splitting about imaginary situations, anything and everything in the line of pure 
ethical theory, should be utterly tabooed in the school room. But with these 
precautions observed, and under the guidance of a teacher of well developed 
. moral sense, boys and girls between 8 and 14 years of age (in the grammar 
schools, where moral education has its most fruitful field) will reason about points 
of ethical practice with interest, and often with a freshness and an acuteness 
that are surprising. If this be not so, then these children in school differ very | 
much from these same children out of school. 
If the course of study is, anywhere, sofull or crowded as not to allow time for 
the occasional talks (one or two a week) about conduct, which I should advise 
as the best method, then that course should be shortened by the omission of 
some branch of much Jess useful knowledge sure to be found init. I would 
avoid set times for these conversations; in them, question and answer should 
play a large part; the more easily (if not very frequently) the teacher “drops 
into” one of them for a few vivacious minutes, the better. Some incident of 
the schoolroom life that has just occurred, or some matter in the lesson in read-

est ing or history may well interrupt the routine of the ordinary recitation, as the 
teacher asks the opinions of the class or of the school on‘the moral point i in 
question, incites them to think more carefully about it, and indicates the con- 
clusion to which long experience has brought the world the starting point, at 
least, for the majority of these ethical talks, for, like every other social institu- 
tion, ‘it has its moral law which must be observed by all its members in order to 
attain its end. ‘The plainly visible chief function of the public school is to im- 
part the elements of knowledge. Tothisend there must be full obedience to 
the natural authority, the teacher; the prescribed conditions of quiet, order, 
and studiousness must be observed by the pupils. Punctuality in attendance 
and readiness for all the exercises; truthfulness in regard to absencefrom 
school, tardiness, or any other failures to comply the regular order; honorable 
conduct with respect to metho’s of passing examinations; polite ireatment of 
‘the other scholars; attention and courtesy to the teacher, such are some of the 
moral necessities of the schoolroom to be met by the scholars. 
The pupils have no duties which should not be met by an equal faithfulness 
to his duties on the part of the teacher, who should not be there teaching unless 
interested in his work, qualified for it, and industrious in improving his practice 
of it. He must be just and impartial in his treatment of the scholars; he must. 
having the authority, exhibit the yirtues of aruler. Teaching politeness and 
honor, the instructor should be an honorable gentleman. * * * The teacher 
has no direct influence over the pupil except in the school hours, and his earnest 
efforts may be rendered almost useless by the indifference, or the hostility even, of 
parents. . But none the less must he strive to connect the morality of the school- 
room, which. he can enforce, with the morality of life outside, as resting on the 
same ‘general principles of reason. While the first rudiments of common sense 
will keep him from speaking of any vice, such as lying or stealing or drunken- 
ness, in such a way as to proclaim his knowledge that it prevails in any scholar’s 
home, he is still free to enlarge upon the manifold evil consequences of it. Thus 
his word may help somewhat to keep children pure in the midst of a bad home 
atmosphere, which he is otherwise powerless to change. 
‘‘Words”—this will usually be easy for the teacher to give in attemnune 
moral education; but nowhere else does word amount to so little compared with 
example. If the word is not resnforced by the example, its influence will be 
small.

Practice fortified by theory.—George P. Brown, chairman committee of National 
Council of Education: It is probably evident to all that’ the writer believes in 
inculeating morality by practicing it rather than by theorizing about it. But 
the time comes in the education of the child when the doctrine that has guided 
the teacher in fixing dominant ideas in the mind of his pupil shall be made | 
known to the pupil. Although, as in many other matters, the theory of morals — 
may well be left until the pupil is well on {his way, in the practice of morality 
this does not preclude the formulating of moral principles and laws which are 
exemplified in conduct wheneyer the ‘child is prepared to recognize them in this 
form, and the organization of these into a system of ethics ‘at a later period 
would be the culminating actof an ideal method of educating the will. A fail- 
ure to reénforce the practice of right-doing by a rational theory of one’s rela- 
tions and consequent obiigations would be to omit the most effective defense 
against the ever-recurring attacks of passion and sense. 
Moral habits induced by school work.—State Superintendent Richard Edwards, 
of Illinois: The schools must develop moral power. In this world there is just 
one thing that has absolute worth, and that thing is character in men and women, 
These surroundings of ours which we so much value are after all only means to 
a loftier end. They have worth, these outward things, because > they contribute 
to the good of man; otherwise they are without value. * * 
What is this child’s aim in going through an arithmetical process? What is 
he seeking for, when, for example, he is attempting to cast the interest on a 
note or to add up a long column of numbers? He is seeking to know the truth. 
He is not inquiring what somebody would like. He is not seeking to find anan- 
_ swer that will please a sect, or a party, or advance his own pecuniary interests. 
What he is seeking is the absolute truth. If he is casting the interest ona note, 
he desires to know what absolute justice requires to bedone. If he isadding up 
a column of figures he is yearning to ascertain the precise and actual amount 
which they represent. In the study of history he is striving to ascertain what 
events have actually occurred, not what someone would like to make someone 
else believe has occurred. In short, the purpose of all school investigation is

  - to find the truth. ‘Is not this a good mofiye? Is not the habit engendered by 
this work a wholesome habit? Suppose the same motive should govern the ac- 
tions of all adults. Suppose that every editorial in a newspaper, every speech 
delivered from the stump, every sermon delivered from the pulpit, should be 
_ animated by the same desire. Would it not be something of an improvement 
7tpon the existing order of things? 
_ The crowning purpose of education.—George P. Brown, chairman of committee, 
“Rational Council of Education : The crowning purpose of education is tomake the 
will follow the lead of conviction in all matters involving the idea of duty. The - 
moral will is the significance, so to speal, of all the other activities of the mind. 
Anstitutional life is the moral will as it has realized itself. The ethical ideal is 
actualized in human society to the extent that it is common to the particular 
members. The principle of conduct in the ethical world is whatis knownas the 
moral law. This law is the universal conviction that every act of each particu- 
lar member of the ethical whole should be such that when universal, that is, 
becomes the act of all, it will return upon the doer to bless and not to curse him. 
In this way the institutional world becomes a ministration of grace, each citizen 
receiving a return for every good deed, the good ineréased a thousand fold. 
  Religious instruction in the schools of Ontario.—Hon. George W. Ross, minister 
of education: Every school is required to be opened by the reading of Scripture 
and by prayer, and closed with prayer. In the Roman Catholic separate schools 
the religious exercises are subject to the direction of the trustees. No pupil is 
required to attend upon the religious exercises of the public school whose par- 
e1os or guardians notify the teacher of their desire that he should absent him- 
self. Provision is made for religious instruction by arrangement with the trus- 
tees of any denomination at such hours as may be agreed upon. 
Reform thehome fu'st.—Popular Science Monthly: If the clergy, instead of mak- 
ing futile demands for the teaching cf theological dogmas in the schools, would 
try to rouse the minds of their adherents and followers to a sense of their per- 
_ sonal responsibility for their childrens*characters, they might accomplish amore 
useful work. This is something which they should preach in season and out of 
- season; and if they would doso with the earnestness which the cecasion demands, 
the effect might in a few years be seen in the altered moral tone of a portion of 
_ the public-school teachers themselves ; and thus, concurrently with the elevation 
of the home, we should have a notable improvement in the work of moral edu- 
cation as carried on in the schools. Reform the home, and the whole face of so- 
ciety will be reformed. 
Catholic views on the vight of the state to edueate.—Declaration of principles bye 
Cardinal Manning (English): 1. The children of a Christian people have a 
right by divine law toa Christian education. 2. Christian parents have a two- 
fold right and duty, both natural and supernatural, to guard this inheritance of 
their children. 3. Christian children are in no sense the children of a state 
that has no religion. 4. Their teaching and training or formation as Christians 
_is of higher moment than all secular instruction and may not be postponed to it 
or risked to obtain it. 5. In the selection of teachers by whom their children 
shall be instructed Christian parents have a right and a duty which excludes all 
other human authority. 6. To deprive the poor of this right and liberty, which _ 
is claimed by and yielded to the rich, is a flagrant injustice. 
~ These also from Cardinal Manning +; State education is the worstform of edu- 
cation, fatal to the independence of national conscience, energy, and character. 
* * # You can force us to pay your rate, but you can not rob our children of 
_their religion. * * * ,[The] moral unity of a people drilled by state educa- 
tion and state pedagogues and state policy is spectral and lifeless. * * * To 
compel the parents of a Christian people to send their children to schools where 
no religion is taught, as in America, or where the Bible is only read, withoutin- 
terpretation, or without its true interpretation, or, still worse,with erroneous in- 
terpretation, and by interpreters untrained and incompetent to interpret, is 
a violation both of natural and political justice. It is an outrage on the nat- 
ural rights of parents and on the religious conscience of a Christian people. 
The common-school system in America is a case in point.

judges necessary for the attainment of the temporal common welfare, which is 
the end of civil society. Now, among the most necessary means for the attain- 
ment of the temyoral welfare of the gommonwealth is the diffusion of human 
knowledge. Therefore, civil authority has the right to use the means necessary 
for the diffusion of such knowledge, that is to say, to teach it, or rather to have 
it taught by capableagents. “ ‘ 
Jobn A. Mconey, in the Educational Review, in reply to the foregoing syllo- 
gism of Dr. Bouquillon: All that is necessary’ to the welfare of the State is not 
within its competence. If it were otherwise, then the State could claim a right 
to teach religion, for.religion is necessary to the welfare of the State. There 
are legit:mate and temporal means necessary for the temporal common welfare, 
and not within the State’s right.. The procreation of children, an able critie 
safely claims, is necessary for the welfare of the State, and a means both legiti- 
mate and temporal. Still no one will concede that the State may compel all the 
citizens to precreats children. Logically the state, in whose behalf the reverend * 
doctor argues, is the socialistic state. The diffusion of human knowledge which  ~ 
he concedes to the State is, as we have seen, that large diffusion possible within 
the boundless limits of the three R’s. One might as reasonably deny that this 
“education” is sufficient as to claim that it isnecessary. And by what authority, 
some one will ask, does he determine that ‘‘ the right to use the means necessary 
for the diffusion of human knowlcdge ” is to be understood as ‘‘ the right to teach 
it, or to have it taught?” Why shall not we define the ‘means necessary for 
the diffusion of human knowledge” as a something more or less than teaching ?” 
The professor’s conclusion agrees with’ his own views. It is, however, not a 
logical conelusion, but an assumption added to the various assumptions made in 
is premises. His-critics have called Dr. Bouquillon’s attention to these and to 
other defects in his method of reasoning. Having based himself on premises 
not true, and on a conclusion doubly illegitimate, was he safe in ‘affirming that 
the larger number of theologians admit that the State has the right to edu- 
eate ?”, With perfect safety it may ke affirmed that if the larger ‘umber do 
admit such a right, most certainly they basé thei admission on some more flaw- 
less syllegism. “As a matter of fact, no theologian to whom the reverend doctor ~ 
has appealed admits the right of the State to educate. 
Right Rev. Thomas A. Becker, D. D., Bishop of Savannah: We do not doubt 
that the time is fast approaching when the State will confine herself to herlegit- 
imate duties, of the which there are enough, and those sufficiently onerous, with- ~ 
_ out undertaking to supply us with a secular instruction which we do not want 
in any other manner than ag a handmaid to rel gion, and with which, so accom- 
panied, no. government can furnish us. W it even possible, such a power is 
too liable to. abuse tobe left in any governmental hands; and finally, upon par- 
ents, a3 such, devolves the responsibility for the souls of their offspring, and we 
dare not, even if we could, shift it from where the Almighty has placed it. - 
Hon, E. F. Dunne (in an address at the Catholic Congress, Baltimore, 1889) : 
Morality is the only foundation of order. Therefore the State not only may but 
must assist in the production of morality. It must doit or die,for without mo- 
rality order is impossible, and without order the State can not live. There can 
be no morality without religion. Therefore the State which wars upon religion 
undermines its own foundation—precipitates its own destruction.. Moral eul- 
ture is of more importance to the State than any other ; instruction which does 
not give it is not education. Therefore the State should encourage education 
full and complete. _To aid in education the State may endow schools and assist 
teachers, but—itself to teach? , No! That is beyond its charter, beyond its 
rights, beyond its power. 
Compulsory teaching is of inferior quality.—The aichaot Journal : That teacher 
who is throwing out the strongest moral influences in her school is the least 
conscious of it. It is unconscious radiation, as flowers fill the air with fragrance. _ 
There is a certain benefit to a school, from carrying out a programme of mor- 
als—that is,a programme that has certain times and occasions and ways laid 
down for the imparting of moral instruction. But like all compulsory teaching 
it is of inferior quality compared with that which flows out naturally from every. 
pore of the teacher's soul. ie 
Not new.—H. C. Hardon, master Shurtleef School (Boston): That old lie that 
there is no religion in the schools. a 3

A XIV.—ScHooL MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE.     ~_. Uniformity and freedom.—¥. W. Parker, Cook County Normal School: Uni- * 
formity may he anecessity the evolution.of a school system, or any other sys- 
_ tem; but there comesatime when this rough staging should be torn away. The 
next period of evolution must be a period of liberty, that liberty so restricted 
that it will lead to freedom. Merit in fixing uniformity is complete skill in 
, routine duties, a strict compliance with conventional demands, the order that 
keeps pupils still; the teaching that complies with the letter of a course of study; 
the drill that passes classes cn bloc from grade to grade; the spirit that humbly 
bows to dogmatic rules. Under uniformity, teaching is a business and not an | 
art. A business is governed by fixed rules; an art by eternal principles. 
_ Think for a moment of a great corps of teachers, each imbued with a divine 
enthusiasm of study and a firm devotion to the highest interests of humanity; 
_ each striying to find more and more of truth, and to apply it for the weal of the 
child. Think of each giving freely to all the treasures and truths that he finds, 
,and receiving as freely from all, their discoveries. Under such circumstances

     anes XV.—SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Free high schools unwise.-—James P. Munroe, in the Educational Review: The 
maintenance of free high schools is unwise; first, because it obliges a whole 
_ community to pay for what only a limited number can enjoy ; second, because, 
necessarily expensive, it robs the lower schools offunds essential to them; and, 
third, because it offers to boys and girls wholly unfit for secondary education a* 
temptation to exchange the actual benefits of remunerative work at 15 years of 
age for the doubtful advantage of a training that can have no direct bearing upon 
‘ their life work, and which, at the time of life it occurs, may do decided harm. 
ae The State must, of course, take the initiative in providing secondary schools sep- 
arate from or in connection with those already established by private enterprise, 
-» andit must maintain such course of study as the needs of the community demand ; 
but for these courses there should be a graded system of fees, regulated by the 
nature and extent of the studies pursued, and, while a certain proportion of the 
cost of their support might be assessed upon the taxpayers, the larger share 
should be borne by those in attendance. When suchaschoolceases to be mainly 
self-supporting, the town or school districtshould have power to suspend ituntil 
the demand for reopening justifies its revival. In this way only can the high 
school do the work that should be required of it; only by such a pruning can the 
primary and grammar schools receive the money and attention they deserve ; 
and after such a bold first step can a real reform of the public-school system be 
begun. 
Public high schools vs. academies.—Intelligence : The public high schools, es- 
pecially those of New England, are steadily coming to the front as the schools 
which give the most thorough and useful preparation for college. Three times 
within a few years the valedictory at Yale has been awarded to a student whose 
preparatory studies were in the New Haven High School. 
The rise of the public high school as the crowning feature of the system of 
common school education is a most interesting fact. In several of the New 
England States these schools have caused the delay of most of the old-time 
academies which were once flourishing institutions, or at all events their rela- 
tive decay. Except a few which, by reason of their large endowment or some © 
especially favorable condition, have grown with the growth of population, they 
haye fallen into comparative obscurity. 
Suggestions as to the curriculum of the preparatory school.—President D. C. Gil- 
man (in the Cosmopolitan ): Whenever the time comes for arevision of the cur- 
riculum of the preparatory school, three subjects should receive much more at- 
tention than is now given tothem. The study of science should be so pursued 
that the habit of se observation and of reasoning upon ascertained facts 
‘should at least be initiated. - Nature should be approached by the schoolboy as 
@ willing and ever-present teacher. Her lessons should be the delightof every 
adolescent. When we remember that in contemplating the heavens, in watch- 
ing the life of plants and animals, in the observation of the modes of motion and 
in studying the inorganic world there are innumerable and infinitely varied 
opportunities to awaken curiosity, to train the eye and the hand, to exercise 
the judgment,to reward investigation—how strange that so little progress is made 
in the introduction of seientific studies in elementary education! Modern lan-

guages also, especially French and German, are nowadays indispensable ina 
liberal education ; and they are much more readily acquired in childhood than’ 
maturity. How are they to get just’ recognition in the preparatory schools? — 
An acquaintance with the Bible should also be required of every schoolboy. 
College professors have lately been showing how ignorant the youth of America 
are of the history, the geography, the biography, and the literature of the 
-gsacred books. I do not now refer to its religious lessons, but I speak of the 
Bible as the basis of our social fabric, as the embodiment of the mostinstruc- 
tive human experiences, asacollection of poems, histories, precepts, laws, and — 
examples, priceless.in importance to the human race. These Scriptures have 
pervaded our literature. All this inheritance we possess in a version which is 
unique. Its marvelous diction, secured by the revisions of many centuries, and 
its substantial accuracy, the care of many generations of scholars, are beyond, 
our praise. But how little study does the schoolboy give to this book in secu- — 
lar or sacred hours; how ignorant may hereally be of that which issupposed to 
be his daily counselor! Science, modern languages and the Bible have been — 
so long neglected in preparatory schools that it is extremely hard nowadays to 
find effective teachers for these subjects. There is no consensus as to books, no ~ 
tradition respecting methods. Perhaps we are waiting for the waters to be 
disturbed by the angel of deliverance, but we shall wait in vain unless we put 
forth efforts of our own to reach the true remedies. The day will come for bet- 
ter things; we can see its approaches. s 
XVI.—TEACHERS. 
Ts special preparation for teaching indispensable?—Superintendent Henry Sabin 
(Iowa): Shall we say that special preparation for the teacher’s work is not de- — 
sirable? Certainly it is very desirable, but it is not indispensable. There are 
only four indispensable requisites—knowledge of subject-matter, uprightness of 
character, a desire to improve, and common sense. With these as a foundation 
we may build an Arnold, an Agassiz, or a Philbrick. If any one of these requi- 
sites is wanting, no amount of professional study or reading of educational books 
can supply the deficiency. There has broken out lately a mania for high intel- — 
lectual development, which the teacher expects to attain by reading a book a 
month. Teachers sometimes become gormandizers of books. Dickens says of 
‘one of his schoolmaster characters, alter enumerating a long list of his require-- 
ments: ‘‘ Ah, rather overdone, Mr. Choakumchild. If he had only learnt a, lit- 
tle less, how infinitely better he might have taught much more!” - 
Superintendent J. M. Greenwood (Kansas City, Mo.): It might be as well to 
state clearly that all this talk about making good teachers without professional 
training is of little value tothe schools. There is no equivalent for professional 
training. * * * Let us understand it, and not beguile ourselves into long- 
winded discussions in the vain search for temporary substitutes. 
Superintendent Draper, of New York, remarked on this subject that he was — ; 
sorry to note a disposition on the part of one or two-speakers to disparage pro- 
fessional training altogether. It wastoo late inthe history of educational prog- 
ress todo this. Such sentiments are outlawed—are back numbers. It was not 
worth while to argue with men who had been enjoying a Rip Van Winkle slum- . 
ber and were out of touch with the general educational sentiment of the country. 1.5 
Four propositions worthy of consideration.—Superintendent Henry Sabin (Iowa): 
1. Pedagogical research, educational inquiry, the study of methodology alone, 
can never Constitute a mana teacher. The machine which makes the teachera 
mere automaton is already producing alarming results in this direction. In 
many of our schools we are approaching the danger line of killing off individu- 
ality, of crushing out spontaniety, of dwarfing the teaching ingenuity by re- 
ducing everything to the dead level of certain so-called philosophical methods. ~ 
We are training the teachers to follow the ruts. 
2. There is a failure with teachers, if I may use the expression, to distinguish 
between an individual method and arepresentative method; between an arrange- 
ment which is the invention of the person using it, partaking largely of the na- 
ture of a device, and a method which is typical in its nature—which exemplifies 
the essential characteristics of all related methods. A device is the creation of 
the teacher—a method is based upon eternal truths. 
Our schools of methods are very often only schools of devices. 
3; The school which gives its students power of thought, clearness of expres- 
sion, aptness of illustration, and a desire to grow; is a good fitting school for its 
teachers. _What branches.are taught there is of secondary importance.

4, To build a wall of partition in the normal school or in the college and say 
| that the studies on this side are purely academic and those on that side purely _ 
_ professional is the concentration of stupidity. The most successful normal school 
* is that which most closely combines in its daily work educational thought and 
‘educational practice.. The attempt to separate them conibines the worst ele- 
ments of a blunder anda crime. a 
It is a fact that the colleges and normal schools do not realize that it is their 
province to prepare teachers for high-school work. When they reach this point 
certain results will follow. They will no longer attempt to prepare teachers for 
their work by reading and studying a few books during the last half of the 
eourse. The science and art of education will be taught during every exercise. 
There will be no less academic work, but it will be of a very different kind. 
Each lesson will be taught as based upon educational principles; the student will 
be required to study it with two ends in view—as he would teach his pupils to 
study it, and as he himself should study it if he were to teach it. Arithmetic or 
geography should be just as much a professional study in the normal school as 
psychology or the histery of education. Every exercise should have a school- 
room side. 
Of the value of scholarship.—Superintendent Henry Sabin (Iowa): The normal 
school which makes excellency of scholarship a subordinate aim makes a very 
grave mistake.- On the other hand, the instructor whose only aim is to induce 
excellence of scholarship has no place whatever in a normal-school faculty. 
Superintendent A. P. Marble (Worcester, Mass.): The young can not be well 
trained by an untaught teacher. It isnot merely the prescribed curriculum that 
the pupil must be made acquainted with. This is the framework, so to speak, 
_ theskeleton, upon which must grow the parts that make upasymmetrical whole}; 
and thissymmetry is produced outof the well-stored mind of aneducated teacher. 
The daily lessons must be enlivened and vivified by related facts and suggested 
ideas. This can be best done from the storehouse of a mind running over with 
knowledge, broad and deep, encompassing the subject-matter of the daily tasks. 
To such broad culture the teacher should, if possible, by all means add an ac- 
~ quaintance with the science and the art of teaching. But valuable as this pro- 
fessional training is, it can never take the place of the indispensable qualifica- 
tion. just named. a 
Theory and experience declare for scholarship.—B, A. Hinsdale: Which is better, © 
much scholarship and little method, or little scholarship and much method? 
The answer to thisquestion can not fora moment be held in doubt. Both theory 
and experience declare for scholarship. In fact, the enthusiasm of knowledge 
_ is a prime requisits of the best teaching. Few school spectacles are more pain- 
+ fulthan that of a peor teacher. eking out slender learning with an excess of 
method. The good scholar without professional training will commonly stagger 
a good deal at first, but if he have the root of the matter inhim he will soon find 
his feet; while the teacher of an ill-organized mind and small equipment gives 
little promise of ever overcoming his limitations. The what will catch the how 
Tong before the how will overtake the wkai! And this is why all sound educators 
plead for the improvement of the intellectual equipment of the teachers of the 
country. 
The function of the normal school.—Edward T. Pierce, prinéipal Chico" State 
normal school (Cal.): Fhe first requisite of good teaching is a thorough knowl- 
edge of the subjects taught; the second is an insight into the principles of edu- 
-eation and the methods of applying them. [If the subject matter is slighted, 
method is purposeless ; and knowledge of methods presuppose an understanding 
_ of the subject.in the teaching of which the methods are to bo applied. There- 
‘fore the normal schools of this State must, at present, pursue two lines of work— 
academic and professional—and should slight neither. 
J. W..Dickinson, secretary State Board of Education (Mass.): A normal school 
may be known from any other institution of learning by the character of the exer- 
cises to which it may be properly limited. If it devotes its whole attention to 
teaching the objects and subjects of knowledge in anacademical way it has no 
_ elaim to a distinct existence. Other schools are doing the same thing. If it 
teaches the philosophy of teaching and the method founded upon it, and the 
_ history of teaching from the earliest times to the present day, it is doing its le-. 
gitimate work. If, at the same time, it attempts to teach the facts and truths of 
the various sciences, then it imposes a burden upon itself which circumstances 
may render necessary to a limited extent, but which should not be allowed to- 
interfere with professional teaching beyond the necessity.

  ILO 
What may be required of all candidates.—State Superintendent A.S. Draper 
(New York): In our cities, the number of candidates for teachers’ positions is - 
_ so great, and the facilities for acquiring proficiency so many, that it is porfeetly 
practicable to require that all candidates shall have completed the high school 
course and spent a year in a normal school or training class before being given 
authority to teach. We passed such a law in our State last winter. It was 
vetoed. But we will have it y 
now without law. All can do it and have plenty of teachers. It is no hardship 
to young candidates. It will work incalculable advantage to the schools. 
How ahigh school may prepare teachers.—Superintendent Henry Sabin (Iowa): 
Occasionally we find a high school which is renowned in all the surrounding 
country for sending out successful teachers. In such aschool, if we investigate, 
we always find certain conditions: 
1, Pupils are taught how to study with a view of getting the most out of a 
subject, not simply out of the book. They practice vivisection on every subject 
they take up. = : 
2. They are taught to exhaust the means at their command. If it is only a 
dictionary, an encyclopzedia, a few reference books at home or at school, they 
make the best use possible of them. Supevabundance of means is sometimes a — 
source of waste to the student. 
3. The pupils are expected to ask questions as well as answer them, and the _ 
teachers are expected to answer questions as well as ask them. The independ~ — 
ence, which the pupil thus gains, goes with him into his school, and serves him ~ 
well in the absence of strictly professional training. It enables him to solve, 
without the aid ofa key, the innumerable problems which present themselves 
almost daily in the schoolroom. 
Enthusiasm is the life of gooa school work. Thus the pupils during four ‘TEACHERS. . 
  
et. Some of our cities are doing precisely this 
years décquire £0 great devotion to their work, they become so aglow with the —' 
delight of acquiring and imparting knowledge that it becomes an appetite, as it 
were, and they are not happy except when under its influence. : 
Of extremeiy doubiful value.—The best psychology.—H. C. Missimer (Erie, Pa.): 
The young girls that go into cur training classes fresh from the high school are 
too immature to understand mental philosophy or psychology. It will only be- 
fuddle them. The power to analyze, to dissect, to connect mental processes in 
their proper relations, is the last and highest achievement of the intellect. Itis — 
the result of much obzervation and wide experience. Fora young girl to psy- 
chologize, to philosophize about the mental process of the child-mind, without 
knowing anything about children, or coming into actual mental contact with 
them is, if not the purest nonsense, of extremely doubtful value. 
Again, the abstract study of psychology, as a preparation for teaching, is very _ 
apt to send the young teacher into the school with a tendency to impose and 
practice upon the children a theory instead of a disposition to study actual. con- _ 
ditions out of which she ought to develop her own theories and her own methods: 
Even the discussion of methods, before we are engaged in teaching, is of liitle 
value beyond conveying an idea of the nature of the work. The method of some- 
_ body else is of no value to me unless it quickens and expands ideas already ex- _ 
isting in my own mind. 
The* best psychology for the teacher—the beginning teacher—is the psy- 
chology of vulgar practice. It is the right kind of psychology to rid our minds 
of foolish, impracticable, and short-sighted notions. It is the psychology that 
shows us where we shall probably fail, and where to concentrate our energies 
in order to succeed. Professional psychology should come after the téaching is 
begun, after common-sense study of the children after the study of actual con- 
ditions. Then it will develop, enlarge, and widen the teaching mind. 
Special preparation may be exacted even in the courtry.—Superintendent A. S 
Draper (New York): We can not expect that all teachers will be as thoroughly 
prepared for their work as they may and ought to bein thecities. Yetexperience 
shows that some special preparation may be exacted evenin the country. Candi- 
dates will comply with wlitis required. Sendall youcan to the regularly eStab- 
lished normal schools, but remember that there can never be enough normal 
schools maintained to supply all the teachers needed in the common schools, 
and also that all candidates can not afford to take a complete normal cours: for 
the sake of the mere chance of being employed at five or six dollars per week, 
with the likelihood of being turned out at the next turn of the political wheel. 
We need short-term training classes throughout the rural districts.

    1180 « EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The use of teachers’ ecaminations.—Superintendent A. S. Draper(New York): 
It is quite the fashion to discredit examinations. It is a foolish habit. The ex- 
amination has its legitimate use. We do not use it to determine who shall be 
certified, but who shall not be. We do not say that all who pass an examination 
. shall be certified by any means. We say that the local officer may withhold 
certificates from any candidate, no matter whethor he passes the examination or 
not, and without giving any reason. We only say that he shall not issue a cer- 
tificate unless the candidate attends upon a prescribed course of professional in- 
struction or passes the prescribed examination. In the next world we may be 
~ able to accomplish ends without means but we can not in this world. * * * 
We will continue to talk about innumerable things, but nothing can be of such 
supreme importance as the institution of efficient agencies for promoting the 
_ professional training of teachers and for preventing the certification of such as 
are not so trained. 
The essential conditions of effective teachers’ examinations.—George William Cur- 
_ tis: Teacherships in the schools are not popularly regarded as subjects of pat- 
ronage. But are they not so practically, and is it wise that they should remain 
so?. What is the present system? I bzlieve that the requirement of certifica- 
tion or license before appointment is universal in all the States of the Union. 
The examination upon which the certificate or license issues is, then, the car- 
-dinal point. What are the vital, essential conditions of effective examination ? 
To be properly effective the examinations must be uniform, entirely competent, 
and wholly independent of the appointing power. The examiners must be sin- 
cerely interested in education, familiar with the duties of a teacher and with the 
requirements of the art of teaching, and capable of conducting an examination 
to ascertain both the scholastic attainments and the specific professional fitness 
of the candidates. Wherever thes conditions do not exist, the publie school 
‘system, and therefore the whole community, suffers. 
A veserve corps of teachers—The Milwaukee plan.—Superintendent William E. 
Anderson, of Milwaukee, Wis.: Some three or four years ago an inquiry into the 
frequency of teachers’ absences, and the average number of substitutes em- 
ployed to fill such absences, suggested a change whereby a larger number of 
well-qualified teachers than those assigned to places should be kept at the com- 
mand of the board. In Milwaukee it was found that of a corps of 400 teachers 
employed at that time there was an average absence of 12 to 15 teachers a day, 
the absences Some days exceeding 20. This includes all vacant places, perma- 
nent and temporary. It frequently happens that two or three vacancies exist 
for which there is no appointee at hand. It was customary, as in other places, 
to occupy these by so-called substitute teachers having no certificates, or by 
those having the certificate, but no experience. A-rule was adopted empower- 
ing’ a committee and the superintendent to appoint a number of supernumerary 
teachers, to be called the reserve corps. These teachers were the best that could 
be obtained during the summer vacation. Their.appointment was regular and 
their salary the same as that of assistant teachers, no deduction being made 
when their services were not required, providing they reported for service at 
_ the office. Members of the reserve corps have their predilections and apti- 
tudes. ~ These, known to the superintendent, are regarded when temporary as- 
signments aremade. <A vacancy in a seventh or an eighth grade is supplied by 
a teacher who is supposed to have the capacity for teaching higher grades. A 
vacancy in the primary grade is supplied by a teacher who is supposed to be 
adapted to primary work. In the mean time the members of the reserve corps, 
‘being s2lected upon grounds of general efficiency, experience, and training, are 
eligible for appointment. Their service in temporary classes commends them 
for appointment, and their detail to occupy recently created vacancies is a kind 
of preparation for appointment. If the principal is satisfied, a resolution of 
transfer from the reserve corps to the corps of the school is all that.is required. 
In this way we have been able to satisfy the prerogative of local commissioners 
who select their own teachers and with the improvement of the plan hope to 
introduce a larger number of capable teachers to fillgacancies. As the reserve 
corps is depleted it is recruited by the commit and the superintendent, 
whose business it is to keep arecord of applicants and to hold frequent meet- 
ings for interviewing applicants for admission to the reserve corps. The corps 
was first organized under rules which prohibited the employment of any teach- 
ers who had taught in the schools previously. The restriction was, however, 
removed, and perhays not for the best interests of the schools. Experience has. 
shown that som2 teachers were kept drifting about upon the reserve corps for a 
 
-P-A-G-E-589
    1181. 
- whole year without finding, in the good opinion of principals and commissioners, 
a transfer to a permanent place. It is best to discontinue such teachers from — 
the service. Otherwise the reserve corps may become occupied by a class of 
professional substitutes and become an invalid corps instead of a reserve to sup- 
ply capable and vigorous recruits. There ave many good features and some un- 
expected drawoacks connected with the plan; but as a plan to enable the school 
board to establish a standard of professional training, to provide itself with a 
sufficient number of teachers duly qualified to reczive appointment when‘sue 
teachers are obtainable, it is abundantly successful. é 
Regardless of the interests of the school.—Sup>rintendent William, E, Anderson, 
Milwaukee, Wis.: The more widely the power of appointment is distributed the 
greater the weight and influence exercised in behalf of the would-be teacher and 
regardless of the interests of the school. We are all acquainted with the com- 
missioner who would bs good enough to give all persons certificates whose _ 
fathers are taxpayers, who look upon the maintenance of schools first of all with 
-reference to the support of teachers, and who sees no farther into the problem 
of licensing and selecting instructors than what appears to be a:charitable mis- 
sion of giving to as many deserving young women as pessible a chance to earna 
decent living. The good man who feels that the place should: be given to the 
applicant who comes first, to the girl who has a mother to support, to the grad- 
uate of his own school, the daughter of a local politician, or a member of the 
same. church with himself, will always flourish in city schoolboards.. Heis fre- 
quently a good man for other purposes but hiring teachers, and there is no rea- 
son for disqualifying him for exercising that function, when his generous pre- 
dilections may. be rendered harmless by a little wise legislation, 
The best way for teachers to acquire control.—J. W. Beeson (in the Educational 
Exchange, Alabama): There should be a love for children on the part of a 
teacher. It isa fact, recognized by all good educators of the present day, that 
the most successful way to govern a child is with love; that when a teacher 
wins the respect and love of a pupil he has no trouble in controlling or in teach- 
ing him. The best way to win this love of children is to love them first. ‘‘Love 
begets love” isa law of human nature. Besides, it seems impossible for one to 
do the greatest amount of good for those for whom they have no special love. 
Guard the teaching force against incompetency.—Superintendent A. S. Draper 
(New York): I lay down the proposition as true that in nine-tenths of the cities 
of this country the board of education will be influenced in the appointment of 
teachers, and will appoint whomever the law and the existing regulations of that 
city will permit them to appoint as teachers, regardless of the peculiar fitness or 
adaptability of the applicant for the position. The conditions should be regu- 
lated by statute law. You must guard the teaching service against incom- 
petency. I undertake to say that in nine-tenths of the cities of the country you 
will get a stronger corps of teachers from regulations which provide that only 
graduates of the city high s®hool or the city normal schools or the training 
schools are eligible to appointment than you will if you throw the matter open 
and let the board select and bring in ‘‘the new blood,” because the board, a3 a 
rule, will abuse the opportunity thrown open to them. 
How shall he learn these thing 
(Ontario): That every future “TEACHERS. | 
  
      
    —Principal George M. Grant, Queen’s College 
zen shall be taught to read is much. That he 
shall be taught to observe and to think is more. But that he should learn to — 
love, admire, and revere that which is worthy, and hate that which is unworthy, 
ismost of all. But how shall the average boy learn these highest things save 
through the voice, tones, and whole life of his teacher ? 
Better even than mere learning.—Superintendent A, P, Marble (Worcester, 
Mass.): Better even than mere iearning and professional skill is a sincere love 
for children and an earnest desire to liftthem up. The teacher, filled with love 
for the little ones, will find a way to help them and improve them, far more 
than one filled with all knowledge and stuffed to repletion with methods, psy- 
chology, and the science of pedagogy, if in attaining all this the juice of human © 
kindness has been squeezed out of her. Children must not be looked upon as 
specimens upon which to practice the arts of the profession. They are human 
sguls to be developed and made manly and womanly. 
Wasting their efforts.—Superintendent Henry Sabin (Iowa) : I honestly believe 
that very many of our teachers are wasting their efforts and failing to do their 
best work, because they are neglécting to regard the things which pertain to

_ the present wants of their schools, in their desire to attain an undefined, intan- 
‘ible, impalpable something, of the nature and use of which they have no de. 
snits idea. 1 wish we had more institute instructors whose instruction is lumi- 
‘nous with the light of common things. 
The relations between teacher and pupil.—President E. B. Andrews, of Brown 
iversity, in School and College: We need, more than we have as yetdone, to 
get upon a level of friendship with our pupils, not standing off from them, not 
looking down upon them. Present yourself to your pupilsas their guide, friend, 
viser, elder brother—one who, having the advantage of age and larger study, 
is able to assist them. The in loco parentis idea of the teacher's office is some- 
times urged as an argument in favor of pedagogical sternness and-severity, Not 
so. Parental authority itself is no longer exercised in the old way. How many ~ 
civilized fathers horsewhip their boys nowadays? In the lower grades, and to 
an extent in all, authority must exist, but it should be kept as mueh as possible 
in the background. ‘Never coerce a pupil save as a last resort. 
Kindness to pupils is never exercised in vain. Strive by unselfishness and 
perfect uprightness to make your pupils regard you the finest man on earth. 
To this end do not assume infallibility, but, if mistaken ever, admit it. Bean 
original thinker, an authority in your department, nomere expositor of a book ; 
yet if you pretend never to err, your dullest scholar knows better and puts it to 
your discredit. 
Never use sarcasm toward a pupil or make fun of him. You are a coward if 
you do, taking advantage of position toenable you to hurt afellow-being as good 
“as yourself, and you will be despised as acowarddeserves. But worse, when you~ 
treat a pupilso, you can teach himlittlemore. The inclination on that learner’s 
part to question you is gone forever, and has given way to timidity, or perhaps 
to a sullenness or obstinacy, which you can never overcome. 
Until he withers into a machine.—Rev. Smith Baker: A teacher who simply 
hears children recite will grow less of a man or woman until he withers into a 
 pfachine, like a circus clown or a magic-lantern lecturer, repeating the same 
performance; but the living teacher, though he remain in the same humble 
school for a generation, will, like a tree, grow broader and higher and deeper 
each year. His teaching will expand his manhood. ‘ é 
What the teacher is imparts itself—Rev. Smith Baker: Every teacher is a pic- 
ture. Eyes are following her while she is silently imparting ideas of life. 
Every teacher should be such a man as we want our boys to be; such a woman 
ag we want our girls to be. No teacher can help being a character builder. 
What he is imparts itself to others. Zhe teacher ef my boy is doing more for my 
boy by what he is than by what he says. ; 
The most powerful lesson.—Superintendent T. F. Wilson (Stillwater, Minn.): 
Set lessons are of but little value. The most powerful lesson by far is uncon- 
_ sciously given by the teacher whose life is a tr@e type of noble manhood or 
«womanhood. <A teacher must live a life above reproach. This alone secures 
respect.. Without respect nothing can be dons. Onca secure this respect and 
the frown of dissatisfaction or the smile of approval will cause deeper lessons to 
‘sink into a young heart than hours of admonition. 
Women as school. teachers.—Hon. John L. Buchanan, of Virginia: Among per- 
- sons liberally educated more women than men find employment as teachers in 
_ the public schools. Infact, in a good many States public-school education is 
already largely in the hands of women teachers, as is shown by late school re- 
ports. In some States there is still an excess of male teachers, but it is con- 
_stantly diminishing. * * * This preponderance in the number of female 
teachers is easily explained. The avenues of remunerative employment for 
- women are more numerous at the present day than formerly. They are proving 
_ themselves faithful and efficient workers in many positions which in former days 
_ were thought to be unsuited to them or to which they were thought not adapted. 
. Public sentiment has materially changed touching this matter and more liberal 
_¥iews prevail. Butstill the sphere of woman is much more restricted than that 
of the other sex, her range of oceipation much more limited. Again, it is al- 
most, if not quite, a universal custom to discriminate against her in the matter 
of compensation. Why the same service equally well performed should in one 
ease have a different money value from what it has in another is hard to ex- 
_ plain on any principle of justice. Yet such is the fact. But woman is the nat- 
_ ural guardian of childhood. Her delicate sensibilities, quick perceptions, active _ 
sympathies, and unselfish affections peculiarly fit her for training and managing

children. Hence her success, spactatiy in the primary departments'of school 
work, suffers nothing by comparison with that of the other sex. And in higher 
departments also, and in positions requiring executive or administrative talent, “+ 
her work is often at a premium rather than at a discount. Doubtless the best 
results in education are to be secured under the influence cf accomplished 
teachers of both sexes. As skilled artists, the delicate feminine touch of the 
one and the vigorous masculine touch of the other are both: necessary to give 
the highest beauty of form and finish to the plastic nature of youth. 
The smail proportion ef maie teachers to be deplored.—State Superintendent John 
W. Dickinson, of Massachusetts: The standard of qualifications for teaching 
has considerably advanced in ten years, so that the demand for men and women 
fitted to take important positions far “exceed the supply. As a cons2quence 
women of experience are now called to positions formerly occupied by mon who ~~ 
taught for a brief term to obtain pecuniary aid in preparing for other pursuits, 
The policy is doubtless as wise in many instances as it is economical, but the 
small proportion of male teachers is certainly to-be deplored. 
Why so?—The Chicago Evening Post: Shall a woman of strong character and. 
great ability, who has made a. long and honorable’ record in the public schools 
of Chicago, be refused promotion ‘because she is a woman? 
Why should they not do so?—Educational News: A New York journal ‘publishes 
it as a fact that the Mercantile Library of New York has but one member who 
reads educational books, and adds that teachers ask for novels. Well, probably 
teachers find a better supply of novels in the Mereantile Library than elsewher e. 
TE so, why should they not enjoy’ them? Probably, also, these same teachers 
have a supply ef pedagogical literature at their homes, and they seek for the 
lighter and more entertaining reading elsewhere. If-so, why should they not ~ 
doso? The statement might) meanmuch,and itmay mean but little. Weknow 
of no class of people who would more fully enjoy the classical fiction oreven the 
lighter literature of our language than. teachers. Surely the constantstrain which — 
they suffer during the working hours of the day entitles them to whatever inno_ 
cent recreation they can get, even if it be the novels of the Mercantile Library 
The supreme question.—Superintendent Henry Sabin (Iowa): Except only the 
question of moral training, all other questions sink into insignificance compared 
with this of supplying the schools in our smaller cities and _towns and in our 
country districts with competent teachers. tsa    
    The pensioning of teachers vecommended.—The following resolution was adopted 
by the department. of superintendence of the National "Educational Association 
‘a its Philadelphia meeting (February, 1891): ‘ 
Justice, as’ well as the best public service, requires the retirement and pensioning of-teachérs after a service of thirty years and upon carefully devised conditions. We recommend the en- actment of laws in the Séveral Statesto permit and to regulate the retirement and pensioning of professional teachers. 
Against pensions.—C. W. Bardeen (Syracuse, N. Y.): Pensions after a certain 
amount of service will make it only the more difficult to get rid of incompetent 
teachers who wish to complete that term of service. 
Master teachers wanted—How to secure them.—President D. C. Gilman in the 
Cosmopolitan: The tendency of our times is'not toward the fostering of such 
teachers [as Arnold, Thring, Abbott, Taylor]. Many of the brightest Americans ~ 
are attracted by business. ‘The three professions traditionally called learned and 
the modern scientific pursuits enlist great numbers. Of those who devote them- — 
selves to teaching the most prefer to enter the service of the college or the” 
university. Few only, so far as my acquaintance goes, seek permanent careers. 
in the service of boys’ schools; few declare that they will b2 satisfied with the 
opportunities and emoluments of a good and faithful teacher. Hence one of 
the most delightful of intellectual pursuits, one of the most useful, one of the 
most honorable, one of the most sacred, is in danger of falling into the hands of 
inferior men. The only remedy that I can see is for the head masters, trustees, 
and parents to be on the watch, and when a born teacher appears engage him, 
reward him, encourage him, retain him. See that his path is free from stones,, 
that he is not overworked or harassed, and that he is kept contented in his lot. 
Let him be sure that as much respect ’and as much income will be his as would 
fall to his portion were he to enter the pulpit or be called to the bar. Let it 
never be forgotten that the teacher’s gilts are as rare as the poet’s. The meth- 
ods of education can make scholars, pedants, specialists, and a very narrow man.

may live in his den and benefit the world by patient observations and minute 
researches. Butno process has been discovered for making teachers. They 
are like gems, that must be found, for they can not be produced. I would 
rather place aschoolboy under one “all-round man” whose manners, morals, and 
intellectual ways were exemplary, and who was capable of teaching him Homer 
and Euclid, than under a group of specialists selected simply as mathematicians, 
physicists, ‘and linguists. Later on, when the charact2r of a boy is established, 
when his habits are formed, when he knows how to study, when he has learned 
_ the art of acquiring knowledge and the graces of expression, let the specialists 
‘take hold of him. Even then let it be ‘provided that the specialists shall not 
be too narrow. 
XVII.—TEXT-Books. 
-| The valid objection to free text-books.—S. S, Parr: All things considered, free 
books promise most to our schools. There is but one valid objection to this sys- 
tem, and that is the communistic one. "The State undertakes to do what the 
individual should be left to do for himself. Doubtless, free books would be a 
long step towards solving the knotty problem of how to more efficiently educate 
the children of foreign-born parents, who are deterred from the full benefit of 
the public schools by the cost of books and appliances. They would also solve 
the questions of cost and economy. f 
A warning voice from out of the pust.—Azariah C, Flagg (State superintendent, 
New York, in 1830): Great improvements are constantly going on in the charac- 
ter of school books. The greatest experience and much of the best talent of the 
_ country are enlisted in this business, and the fruits of their labors are constantly 
giving them new claims to the approbation of the public.. The adoption of a~ 
particular book would amount to a prohibition upon all improvements and sub- 
ject the inhabitants to a loss of the prohibited books on hand. The interests of 
_ the common schools may be seriously endangered and can not be essentially 
benefited by the adoption by law of any book or set of books. 
The text-book system,of Ontario.—Hon. George W. Ross, minister of education : 
No text-books can be used in any public or high school of the province until 
sanctioned by the department. ‘There is now but one text-book in each of .the 
subjects taught in the public schools. In the case of high schools more than 
one text-book is used in some of the subjects, although the tendengy is towards 
the same limitation as prevails in the public schools. When a text-book ceases, 
in the cpinion of the department, to serve its purpose it is set aside and a more 
advanced ‘one substituted. The pric2 of the text-book, the quality of the 
paper, style of binding, typography, etc., are all regulated by thé department. 
'.Under-a statute, boards of trustees may provide free text-books for pupils in 
cities, towns, and incorporated villages.

1.— ASSOCIATIONS. 
Denmark.—From the 6th to the 8th of August, 1891, was held the sixth Scan- 
dinavian school meeting in Copenhagen. These meetings were at first frequented 
chiefly by primary teachers, as the topics discussed concerned primary schools 
solely, and secondary teachers had their separate philologists’ meetings ; but at 
the last two meetings there have been also lectures and discussions on subjects — 
concerning secondary schools, the result of which has been a discontinuation of 
the previous philologists’ meetings. The last conference numbered 5,300 visi- 
tors, 3,000 of whom were from Denmark, 1,100 from Norway, 1,000 from Sweden, 
and 200 from Finland. (Allg. D. Lztg.) 
Germany.—The German National Teachers’ Union had 44,449 members on July 
1,1891. Seventeen local teachers’ associations joined the union during the last 
half year. (Paed. Ztg.) 5 
Sazony.—The ‘‘ Pedagogical Circle ” of the women teachers in Dresden has 
closed the twenty-sixth year of itsexistence. The number of itsmembers exceeds 
300. The society has listened to several courses of professional lectures, and 
special courses in botany, French, drawing, and gymnastics that were arranged 
for the younger members. The society maintains a bureau of information for 
teachers without positions. It has a sick fund from which during the year 1890 
eight members were supported for several weeks and even months. (Die 
Lehrerin.) 
Prussia.—The pastoral letter of the bishop of Ermland (province of Prussia), 
in which he objects to independent teachers’ associations, has had quite the con- 
trary effect to what he aimedat. The teachers are clubbing together more than 
ever before. Inresolutions couched in respectful terms, they say that while they 
shall never be found wanting in respect for the clergy, they energetically pro- 
test against ecclesiastical interference, and all inroads made into their natural 
and political rights. (Allg. D. Lztg.) 
France.—The first timid attempts at holding national teachers’ meetings in 
France for the purpose of discussing professional affairs date back to the year 
1840; they were kept up for ten years, and then ceased, until revived in 1871. 
Not until that year did these meetings show a firm organization, adapted to- 
promote the successful exchange of professional ideas and practical codpera- 
tion. The example of other states was decisive. The great educational meet- 
ings in Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland induced the French teachers to 
attempt similar meetings, and they were well and readily supported by the 
centralized state authority. 
The first large teachers’ meeting was held in 1878 in Paris. Though the ele- 
mentary or common school claimed the lion’s share of attention, it did not oc- 
cupy the meeting exclusively. The elementary school did not then have the

excellent organization which to-day we have reason to admire; on the other 
hand, owing to several important events, political personages had to be drawn 
_ into the proceedings, persons who carried the discussions into the domain 
of higher education. Here, naturally, principles of pedagogy and general edu- 
cational questions claimed the attention. The claim to an equal education for 
all citizens was urged. Upon this basis it was thought the endeavor to combine 
the different branches of instruction, as well as the different kinds of schools, 
might be successful. The result of this discussion was the adoption of ideas in- 
dicating fundamental reforms, according to which education was to be conducted. 
‘with motives of justice, freedom, and love for the young.” Besides these 
questions, others relating to gratuitous, obligatory, and secular instruction were 
discussed. 
As the work which had been laid out for this-congress could not well be fin- 
ished within thé prescribed limit of time, another session was held in Paris in 
the year 1879, in which questions were discussed touching the protection of chil- 
dren, freedom of instruction, moral education, and instructionin civics, alsocon- 
cerning the teaching of language, drawing, and manual labor. 
Although it ean not be denied that the members of this congress were actu- 
ated by a great love for the cause of youth, one is on the.other hand obliged to 
_ admit that their demands were pushed rather too far. They put in the claim 
_ that every school should possess a workshop, a garden, a library, a museum, and 
a laboratory; also a panorama of history and geography, and a hall for musical 
and other entertainments. They further insist that the site of the school build- 
* ings should be as attractive as possible, and that the buildings should have a 
handsome exterior. , All these demands were naturally shipwrecked on the rock 
expense, especially as instruction was gratuitous; however, the congress had 
this good result: that public attention was directed towards the school question, 
and the school officers and functionaries spurred to renewed activity in this de- - 
partment, in which somuch remained to be done. Theschool authorities hence- 
forth gave much closer and more constant attention to the subject of instruction 
in manual labor, since they recognized how very important to a comprehensive 
education is the early training of hand, eye, and taste. 
The next congress, which also held two sessions in Paris in the years 1880-and 
1881, owed its existence to private initiative exclusively. It met to give ex- 
pression to the wishes of the friends of education in France and other countries, 
who were joined by a small number of French public school teachers. Theidea 
of educational congresses periodically meeting had not taken root very deeply 
among teachers of the public schools, and yet it was necessary to make teachers 
ef the primary schools acquainted with important educational questions and to 
afford them an opportunity for exchange of opinions. Moreover, there were 
brought to discussion in parliament, owing to the interposition of the minister 
of instruction, Jules Ferry, legislative questions relating to school matters, the 
solution of which was anxiously looked for inevery direction. The French Gov- 
ernment, particularly at that time, voluntarily favored the wishes and endeay- 
ors of teachers. 
Formerly, the national administration of education had been satisfied with as- 
sembling certain teachers to hold a sort of professional conference inwhich the 
wishes and projects of the government were submitted and discussed. But now 
the administration frequently called together conventions of teachers; their opin- 
ions were asked, and they were invited to propose principles and methods for 
th2 better regulation of instruction; but the administrative officers held them- 
selves far aloof from all direct influencesof teachers. This mode of procedure is 
still in vogue at the present time, and although the learned and far-famed M. 
Gréard, vice-rector of the Paris Academy and as such the representative of the 
government, constantly appears as the chairman of the teachers’ conventionin 
France, this surely is not done with the ideaof winning the teachers over to the 
views of the government, or to allure them into the government's camp. The 
- honorable character of the great savant isasufficient guaranty againstall that. 
The respect which is so universally manifested toward his experience and his 
stately presence, excludes anything like underhanded actions. He endeavors 
most strenuously. to exclude every personal matter from the debates, and to in- 
sure free discussion to all. His work consists chiefly in devoting his ripe ex- 
perience and his talents to the service of the good cause. He only takes partin 
debates in order, as he himself once remarked, ‘‘to obtain result (by means of 
votes) which may be recognized as the expression of the common views of those 
resent.” : ‘

1880 and 1881, but their work not being finished, it was resolved to hold a third 
congress in the following year. 
The first assembly united the male and female principals of the normal schools 
and a number of public schcol inspectors. The second consisted of the public 
school teachers, whilst the third saw in its midst the faculties of all the normal 
schools and the’ practice departments connected with them. ‘ 
The questions discussed were as follows: 
In the year 1880: 
1, The educational organization of ungraded public schools. 
2. The methods of obtaining a better preparation of students for the normal 
schools. 
In the year 1881: 
1. Means for improvement of school attendance. 
2. Instruction and education in the lower grades of public schools. 
In the year 1883: 
1. What are the experiences that have been made up to this time with the 
newly organized normal schools in regard to teaching force, SUBSE aoe and 
dormitories? 
  especially in regard to psychology and morals? 
3. Organization of practice schools and their extension. 
4. Questions concerning the service which a normal school can render the 
teachers of the province. 5 
All these questions were discussed in a practical and definite manner ; | most 
of them had already been considered in the assemblies of the cantons and de- 
partments. After the congress had disbanded, its proceedings were given to © 
the public on the part of the ministry. Cours Pédagogiques de 1881 et 1883 
(Paris, Imprimerie Nationale). 
The reproach has been cast upon this congress that it was entirely official; 
but although we recognize the importance of conventions perfectly independent 
and free from any official interference, yet, on the other hand, we must also admit 
that a liberal ministry not disinclined to reform will surely avoid everything 
that might arouse a suspicion of partiality. Judging by the spirit which char- 
acterizes the French educational administration, it can not ke doubted that its 
aim was and is merely to learn the views of its most i important fellow-workers 
in the great causé of education, and these most assuredly are the teachers. It 
invites them to conferences, follows their labors, tests their results, and carries — 
out their plans as far as it is practicable. Although financial difficulties often 
frustrate the good intention of the French Government, we must for that reason 
not think that the government in its codperation with superiors and subordi-- 
nates fails to see the best solution of the difficult educational problems. 
Thus, then, the first step toward inaugurating large teachers’ meetings was 
made. Thos> who participated in the congress returned to their homes with 
the consciousness of having fulfilled their duty, but also with the wish that they 
might soon again take part in such an assembly $ ; for they had the satisfaction of 
seeing that Parliament and school authorities hastened to embrace in legisla- ~ 
tive bills some of the requests which had been brought up in the congress. « It 
was not long before the next great convention was held. It took place in the. 
city of Havre, in the year 1885. 
Havre had always been noted for her friendliness to the schools, as well as her 
excellent school institutions. Her public and business schools are considered the 
best in the whole country ; her school buildings, as far as elegance and statély 
architecture are concerned, are unequaled in France. The ‘city from time to 
time sends teachers to foreign countries in or: ‘der that they may learn other sys- 
tems of education, and it was first in Havre where a ‘‘ Society for Objective In- 
struction ” display: ed in schools and societies by means of lantern slides the most 
important discussions of modern times, the miracles of nature and industry, ina 
manner suited to the ordinary under: standing. 
The suggestion to hold an International Congress of Teachers was made by 
the mayor of the city, M. Jules Siegfried. In his resolution relating to this 
measure, he emphasized the importance of congresses in all the departments and 
especially in that of education, because it was only in this way that valuable and 
tried improvements could find entrance. All partake of the benefit derived 
from them, teachers, pupils, families, and the country itself. The resolution 
was adopted, and acommittee composed of representatives of the teaching profes- 
sion and of the state officials was intrusted with the preparatory work. “The as- 
    sembly was to take place atthe end of September, and at the beginning of August _

‘twenty-five hundred persons had signified their willingness t> participate. M. 
_ Gréard was asked to occupy the chair at the opening of the congress, which was 
to be divided into three sections; the minister of instruction had also promised 
to b2 present at the opening. 
The assembly, which was well attended, was principally occupied with the con- 
sideration of four questions, to wit: (1) The benefit derived from national and 
international educational congresses; (2) instruction in manual labor in the pub- 
lie schools, and organization of schools for mechanics; (3) teachers’ salaries in 
different countries; in what proportion should state and community contribute’ 
to the salaries of teachers? (4) the question of practical preparation of candi- 
dates for the position of teachers in the normal schools. 
The discussions of the third question excited the greatest degree of interest, 
because the law of the 16th of January, 1781, relating to gratuitous instruction 
in the public schools afforded some natural advantages to the older teachers, 
but contained some rather unfavorable passages for the younger men. A recti- 
fication of this matter was demanded as far as the finances would permit. The 
demands of the assembly on this point were comprised in these, which were sub- S 
_ mitted to the government. The second and fourth numbers of the programme 
were also thoroughly considered; and again, a renewed interest was manifested 
in the question of manual training, the plan of which had been determined by 
the law of December 11, 1880, and by that of March 28, 1882. This subject, 
which, like no other one, isin need of the warm advocacy of inspired enthusiasts 
and requires as low penetration into the consciousness of the people at large, 
was also brought up before the international congress of the year 1889; yet even 
now it has not been settled in an entirely satisfactory manner, though all are 
convinced of the importance of this discipline in the educational work of the 
public schools, and would not agree to abandon it as a branch of instruction ? 
The question of the benefits of national and international congresses naturally 
could not be disposed of in one session; the discussion therefore ensued as to 
the intervals after which such conventions should be held ; what persons should 
be invited as deputies, and what means should be employed for defraying the 
expenses. It was proposed to elect a permanent committee from the assembled 
delegates for the purpose of organizing congresses; but the idea was dropped 
at the request of the minister of education, who had himself expressed his will- 
ingness to convene such an assembly in case of necessity. 
Mention should here be made of another, namely, the international, technical, 
commercial, and industrial congress, held in Bordeaux in 1886, which fell be- 
tween the international congress of Havre and that of Paris in 1887, and enjoyed 
the patronage of the ministers of commerce and instruction and other high 
officials. The first subjects brought up were those relating to technical and 
commercial instruction; the next under consideration was that of the means of 
promoting the interests of the merchants and tradesmen of the future through 
public school instruction. 
The Congress of Havre had expressed a strong desire to hold a similar con- 
gress in Paris in 1887. A journal entitled ‘‘ Les Congrés Instituteurs” had 
been started in 1885, which had assumed the task of preparing the way for the 
Congress.of Paris. The first appearance of this journal, issued by an educational 
society, atoace opened the campaign for the idea suggested in Havre of form- 
ing a central union composed of the entire body of teachers in France. This 
journal desired to assemble a congress independently, although it was well- 
known that the minister had expressed his willingness to act inthe matter. The 
result of the numerous meetings which were held for the purpose of preparing 
a national congress, was the unanimous adoption of the following resolutions: 
First. A friendly league should be formed of all the teachers in each depart- 
ment. These unions collectively, are to form the ‘‘ Union of Teachersof France,” 
Second. The delegates, and all taking part in the congress of 1887, were to take 
upon themselves the organization of these unions. Third. The “union of the 
_ teachers of France’? shall endeavor the establishment of permanent interna- 
~ tional educational congresses. 
The most determined adversary of the project of a permanent congress was 
the minister of education at that time, M.Spuller. In a circular of September 
27, 1887, addressed to the prefects, he announced his firm intention to oppose 
this idea, and also any confederation designed to carry it out. In his opinion 
the congress would not subserve the purposes of progressive thought, or afford 
a place for the free interchange of opinions, but would degenerate into a mere 
wrestling place of passions and ascene of disorder. The circular met with the - 
most violent resistance. The teachers were of the opinion that as they were in

noseuse state officials the rights to protect themselves against all political in- 
terference should at all times be permitted them. 
It may easily be imagined that this delicate matter was broached.at the Con- - 
gress of Paris, yet, as the element of prudence was a prominent one, very little 
time was devoted to it. Besides, the work before the congress was of such a 
a serious nature as to absorb all the time and attention of the delegates. The 
work was divided into five sections, viz, pedagogy, professional interests, pro- 
vision for old age, the organization of congress, and gratuitous instruction.. As 
the greater part-of the questions had been prepared at former discussions the 
congressional debates could be essentially shortened. The questions submitted 
to debate were those that occupied the teachers all over France, and their selec- 
tion had been made by preliminary inquiries, so that from the beginning these 
topics met the approval of the majority. 
The next and latest international, congress in the interest of common-school 
affairs was held, opportunely, during the Paris Exposition of 1889. It was the 
result of efforts of the earlier educational congresses, and took the shape of an 
earnest manifestation of sympathy on the part of foreigners for the aspirations 
of the promoters of the educational system of France. The resolutions of this 
congress are still well remembered by all. (After L, Fleischer, Vienna.)

In looking over the analytical table of books published during 1889, which was   printed on the last day of that year, an exceptional literary activity was re- 
vealed. The figures for 1889 are not quite so large, but still they mark a pro- 
duction of between three and four hundred books more than were counted up 
and classified in 1888. In other words, the statistics go to show that the year 
1889 has produced about one work per diem, Sundays included, more than the 
output of 1888. Comparing or contrasting the number of publications in 1889 
with those of 1888, we find in theology a slight decline, both in new books and 
new editions. In educational works, also, 1889 has fewer works to show than its 
predecessor. Books for young people, on the other hand, show a good increase. 
Of novels and stories there are noted no less than 1,040 new books, besides 364 new 
editions. This gives the ardent novel-reader a3 many as three novels for each 
week day, with a balance to spare, and one new edition for every day.

- ~ Itis significant that the book production in Germany since 1886 has been 
steadily increasing, and that the increase is altogether in the direction of the 
more solid branches of literature, as theology, law, medicine, and natural his- 
tory. In fiction the advance is almost imperceptible, the increase in the whole 
‘department of socalled Schine literatur (Romane, Gedichte, Theater, etc.) being 
but sixteen new works. 
3.—CLASSIC LANGUAGES. 
Germany.—In Germany, during late years, the conflict. between the gymnasia 
~ (classical high schools) and the realschulen (modern high schools) became heated, 
because all petitions for admission of realschulen graduates to the university 
were refused by the Government and the university faculties. This is a vital 
point if we consider that the conditio sine qua non of a professional man (no one 
speaks of women in this connection in Germany) is to have gone through the 
* classical high school, i. e., to have spent in the study of Latin and Greek re- 
spectively nine and six years. People that opined that one may become, if not 
a philologist and theologist, at least a physician or scientist and lawyer, without 
the knowledge of Greek, laid more stress on modern languages and insisted upon 
acombination of gymnasia and realschulen under the name of real-gymnasia. 
This kind of school was a hybrid which could not expect to live long, consider- 
ing the capacity of the juvenile brain. The real-gymnasium endeavored to com- 
bine the advantages of the classical and modern high schools, and, of course, 
overburdened the pupils. 
For twenty years the authorities permitted the problem to stand unsolved. 
Almost unbearable hardships resulted from the fact that the curricula of the 
high schools were inflexible, nonelastic, cast-iron. Ambitious parents of small 
means made heroic efforts at securing for their sons a better future than thought 
possible in modest occupations, such as trades and commerce. When the boys 
failed during their protracted course of professional training (i e., three yearsin 
preparatory classes, nine years in the classical high school, and four years in _ 
the university), their future was blighted; being “studied men” they were con- 
sidered ‘“‘spoiled” for trades and commerve, and thought themselves too good 
for manual work. Hence they joined the army of malcontents. Every kind of 
high school in Germany has special aims in view, hence shapes its course and 
modes of training accordingly. That a school, and even a college, should be 
what it is in England and America, a school of general culture, and not a place 
in which to obtain an education ad hoc, was vigorously preached by Dr. Wich- 
ard Lange, Dr. O. Frick, and many others, The educational press devoted 
much space to plans for a simplifications of curricula and a unification of schools. 
“The literature of Germany on the subject of se¢ondary schools, especially the 
“ Binheitschule”.(common school) is quite copious, but the reform made little 
if any progress. < . 
Conservatism embodied in the highest school authorities of the leading states 
of Germany adhered to time-honored customs, until recently Emperor Wilhelm — 
II, who has himself been a pupil of a gymnasium, and is fully aware of the un-

bearable conditions arising from the attempts at education ad hoe, and ebieliy 3 
rompted by his desire to counteract the socialistic tendencies (centrifugal, 
R eeerGEty e tendencies, as he calls them) of the present time, took the initiative 
in his capacity as King of Prussia, and called together anumber of well-reputed 
educators, journalists, scientists, legislators, and representatives of the church 
for a special inquiry into the conditions of secondary instruction in his king- 
dom. This commission held its sessions from December 4 till December 17, 1890, 
in Berlin, and formulated a number of propositions for reform of. higher educa 
tion, among which are some that materialize a portion of the hopes of the ad- ~ 
vocates of ‘‘ Einheitschulen.” 
In future, this commission decided, only two kinds of the sample card of secon- 
dary schools now existing shall be preserved: The Gymnasium and the realschule; 
that is, the classical and modern high school. The former is to prepare for 
      entrance into the university where the learned professions are recruited; the 
latter to prepare for polytechnicums, for administrative officers, for commerce, 
agricultural, and technical colleges, etc. The hybrid form, ‘‘realgymnasia,” is 
to be abandoned, all other secondary schools shall in due course of time conform 
with either of the kinds mentioned. Instead of a uniform, a dual system is advo- 
eatsd, notan ‘“‘einheitschule,” buta ‘‘zweiheitschule.” Where not enough pupils - 
are found in a small town to construct the entire nine years’ course, the upper 
grades of the high schools of several towns are to be combined in one school in 
the most centrally located town. But in order to enable these two kinds of high 
school to follow their course undisturbed, it is thought best to give each its own 
preparatory classes. This latter measure makes illusory the efforts at unifying 
or fusing at least the lower classes, and the fiat has gone forth to establish a 
gulf between those who have means, inclination, or ambition to obtain a higher 
education and those who have not. 
While the work performed by the commission may be said to bo a step in the 
right direction, it does notseem in harmony with the democratic tendencies of 
the age, since it still necessitates an early decision on the part of the parents as 
to what the boy (mark the word boy, for the girls ars not considered in this — 
connection) is to become. It reéstablishes the predestination theory as it were, 
especially so, because a common substructure for both kinds of high school in 
form of a common preparatory department is rejected. When we see that the 
French Republic, with true insight into the best means for its perpetuation, es- 
tablishes a common school which terminates ina high school and brings the 
lyeées into organic connection with elementary schools; when we see the same 
organization adopted in the Swiss Republic we conclude that Germany will have 
acommon school (‘‘einheitschule”) as soon as it becomes a republic, and not 
untilthen. [R. K., in Ed. Review.] 
Switzerland.—The pastoral conference of the Canton Granbuenden, Switzer- 
land, recently expressed its views concerning the teaching of the classic lan- 
guages by adopting the following series of theses presented by Rey. Truog: 
(1) Latin has become the language of learned men through school, asceticism, 
and humanism; but since the natural sciences have made thei stonishing up- 
  ward start the classic languages as a study have lost their position. Despite of _ 
that they have remained, or rather were kept the leading study in high schools, 
because they were, or their acquisition was, th: ought of peculiar pedagogical 
value. 
(2) But the pedagogical value of (particularly) Roman classics is, as far as 
their contents areconcerned, questionable. Forthe purpose of formative train- 
ing of the mind, other branches of study are much better suited ; moreover their 
acquisition will aim at general culture, a thing that-can not be said of the con- 
tents of Latin authors. 
(3) For theologians a certain limited quantity of Latin and Greek, however, 
seems an indispensable thing on account of the necessity of referring to original 
texts. The same may be true of other learned professions. But while we grant 
that a knowledge of Greek and Latin is desirable it would seem a3 though ‘‘less 
would be more *—that is to say, the knowledge referred to could be acquired 
during the last two years of the course. 
(4) If, however, we can not do without theclassics we might introduce them in 
translations. Alichureh authorities who have written in Latin have been trans- 
lated admirably, and there seems to b> no urgent necessity for the physicians 
and lawyers either to surround themselves with a high wall of Latin. 
(5) It is in our opinion best to replace Latin and Greek in the lower grades of 
secondary schools by other branches of study, such as stand in close relation to 
the urgent demands of modern life. 
(6) Every high-school course should be so arranged as to offer during the first — 
 
-P-A-G-E-600
      EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. — 
  two-thirds of the course a general culture desirable for everybody, and only dur-_ 
ing the last third of the course the demands of the learned professions should ba 
heeded by offering Latin gnd Greek. (It must be borne in mind that European 
high schools have a six to eight, or even nine years’ cours2, beginning with 9 or 
10 years, and terminating rarely before the nineteenth year of age.) 
~ (7) If the school is thus designed it will be able to do more for citizenship by 
teaching history better; more for man himself by teaching hygiene and physi- 
ology; more for the business career of thousands of young men by teaching com- 
_ mercial geography, bookkeeping, and modern languages; more for literary cul- 
_ ture by teaching the literature of modern times, and more for the prosperity of 
the country by teaching physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering more 
thoroughly than heretofore; finally, something might be done in the way of 
__ technical and industrial training. But as long as the classics claim time and 
energy o/ teachers and students, we rear generation after generation of discon- 
_ tented men who can not find a place in this busy li.e.of modern times. 
We refrain from.all reflections, and leave the thinking reader to rhyme these 
theses with his own views. Many will find it hard work; others will chime in 
readily. At any rate, there is no half way shilly-shallying about these theolo- 
gians. And a decided view, be it right or wrong, is better than no y.ew at all; 
_ hence the expressions couched in the foregoing seven paragraphs have a pe- 
-culiarly refreshing flavor. (Schweitzer-Schularchiv.) 
       
     
     
            
    
   
VIEWS CONCERNING THE PEDAGOGICAL VALUE OF LATIN AND GREEK—A 
i SYMPOSIUM.'*    
Since this subject is still a point of pedagogical controversy, a few recent utter- 
ances of noted men may be quoted. (Editor ‘‘Paed.”) 
ea pa von Asboth. (Proceedings of the Hungarian Parliament, Buda- 
est, 1890. eS If it is the policy of the State to eliminate the study of Greek, if it excludes. 
- the antique world from the secondary schools, that is from general national 
education, it robs the nation of that which can not be replaced. From that 
moment, especially since the religious ideas of the people are already shaken, a 
generation will arise that has no contact with the’past; a society in which peo- 
ple will think it useless to know where their grandfathers are buried, and still 
more useless to know what they lived and died for. A generation will spring 
up which from its lofty summit of enlightenment will look down with derision 
upon its ancestor’s piety and prejudices; it will, with strict logic, come to the 
conclusion, sooner or later, that reverenc2 for parents has a practical justifica- 
tion only so long as the parents may be immediately useful to us. A generation 
will grow up indifferent to the past, indifferent also to the future, knowing no 
other interests than enjoyment, comfort, and tangible gain. 
“And when this American view of things, this extreme of Western spirit, 
meets with the spirit of the East; when this Western longing for enjoyment 
and profit is not coupled with the feverish activity of the West, when Oriental 
indolence is not coupled with Oriental temperance and want of pretension, but 
when the longing for pleasure and gain meets with Oriental indolence and want 
of habits of industry—as they do with us, alas, so frequertly—then this match 
will result in a degenerate and ever-sinking society, under whose guidance we 
shall become a depraved race, but never a nation. 
“The proud-spirited Hungarian nation can not, in its present numerical rela- 
tion to others, be satisfied with playing a subordinate rdle. My opinion is that. 
it will be one of the most fatal errors to nurse the illusion that we, with our 
numerical strength in this portion of Europe, surrounded as we are geograph- 
ically and ethnographically, could be able to maintain a state of the second or 
third rank—a state that need not trouble itself about others, and about which 
others would noé trouble themselves. Such a so-called neutral middle state has 
never been able to be preserved in the southeast of Europe. The Hungarian 
nation will either occupy a prominent position in the empire which it supports 
(and that was the policy of the Arpades, the Anjous and the Hunyadys, and I 
venture to say was the fundamental principle of Francis Dedk’s policy), or it will 
be nothing but an oppressed and degénerats nationality. An intellectual prom- 
inence, or the most energetic exertion toward reaching it, is that with which 
we supplement our unfavorable numerical proportion. 5

studies which give knowledge of the Homin heart and soul, and teach how to — 
' guide and govern the human being. 
“We need not depreciate our own time. This era has its admirable acquisi- 
tions, its marvelous inventions which revolutionize material existence from day 
to day, and on account of its feverish activity this era is worthily called great. 
But it is obvious that the era of electricity, lightning trains, nerve-killing tele- 
phone, etc., can not be the time of intellectual concentration. It can not be a 
time of harmonious contemplation of men and the world. The antique world, 
with its simpler conditions of life, its incomparably fewer complications, was 
much more able than we to view the human being from a human standpoint. 
That is the reason why the sources of wisdom, of law, and art, are found in Greek 
culture, compared with which the Latin is only an imitation, a second-hand civ- 
ilization, From these sources is fed, even to this day, our own material devel- 
opment; for, though we have acquired much new knowledge and are acquiring 
it daily, we can scarcely say that we are acquiring new ideas. 
“Through this mental concentration history, legis! ation, and art of the an- 
cients became instructive and sublime: through it the knowledge of the human 
heart and soul beeame profound and true. But all that can be acquired only in 
youth; that is, before life’s combat robs us of the faculty to receive deep impres- 
sions and prevents mental concentration. Afterward, when greater maturity 
comes with its fever of passion and hot blood, the battle for subsistence opens, 
and the everyday humdrum business, the prose of debit and credit, overtakes 
us—then it is too late to acquire all that; and he who would endeavor to do so 
at that age could acquire it only with very much greater trouble, exertion, and _ 
loss of time, or by means of pale-complexioned and insufficient translations. 
“It is a demoralizing argument, one that undermines the national ambition 
of youth, that we should throw out-these studies to which all nations cling, great 
and insignificant alike, only because the mental exertion is too great for us Hun- 
garians. That would not be a proclamation indicating intellectual superiority, 
but inferiority; it would be an abdication of the mission to guide other nations, 
and, indeed, an abdication of the place Hungary has in the galaxy of nations.” 
I. om arecent debat2 in the Norwegian Storthing (lower house of parlia- 
ment 
Prof. Horst (of Troms): ‘‘The classical high school of to-day can not be re- 
garded as a school of general culture. It may seem curious how a man who is 
himself a philologist, and who from early youth has been brought up entirely 
in the atmosphere of classical study ; furthermore, one who has honestly endeay- 
ored to enter deeper into antiquity, how such a man can occupy a standpoint 
such as I do to-day. But I wish to remark that twenty years of teaching the 
classics has brought it about that I arrive at the conclusion mentioned before. 
I have also had ample opportunity to notice how little classic culture is service- 
‘able in life. By the term ‘general culture’ we understand such branches which are 
necessary for life, and Latin and Greek are in this regard not any more essen- 
tial than other branches, unless it be for such persons whose intention it is to 
spend their lives in studies of a similar kind. As far as Greek is concerned, too 
little of it is read to learn the language, and too.much in comparison with’ the 
waste of time it necessitates.” The speaker said he could scarcely find words 
strong enough to express the usefulness of the study of Greek. And yet he did - 
not intend to abolish the study of the dead languages at once; ‘‘that would be a 
revolution, and in matters of school one should proceed with the spirit of reform, 
notin a revolutionary manner.” Hence he suggested to do away with Greek in 
order to make a beginning with reform. “ Nonprofessional men will be aston- 
nished no a little if [ tell them. that this opinion is generally shared by the 
younger philologists. I was struck with the fact that wherever I discussed this 
question with younger colleagues I found ready assent. You will find this to be. 
-the case all over the country and in small towns. What the weight of opinion 
is in the capital I have had ro means of ascertaining as yet.” 
Prof. Koht (of Skien) said: ‘‘I, too, have arrived at a similar conclusion in 
consequence of my Seaseaaoe in school. Classical study does not give what 
those need who from the threshold of schooi enter practical life. Development 
proceeds with inexorable logic, and it cannot be prevented; that it wilreventu- 
ally exclude what is commonly called classical culture. What we need are 
schools of culture which are active in the service of the present time, not in 
the service of the past.” 
fev. Weelsen pleaded for the abolishment of beth Latin and Greek, saying : 
‘Latin has no place in aschool for generalculture. It must be reserved for the 
university, and there taken up by those who need it for their pro‘essional studies. 
There is absolutely no reason why this language should be kept in the second-

ary schools. Its literature is antiquated and, according to my opinion, not only 
not beneficial but even dangerous under certain conditions. The importance 
ascribed to it in formative culture may be found in other branches. I believe 
- that Latin as a requisite component of our higher education is a thing of the 
ast. ‘ 
y Jacob Sverdrup (minister of education) also was of the opinion that the way 
to general higher culture for the majority in the future would be through the 
elements of modern education. According to his opinion there is no sense in 
abolishing Greek only. .‘‘ Why put the ax to the root of the Greek tree and not 
to that of the Latin also? A common high school with a strong Latin tendency, 
that I consider a step backward.” -As a common foundation for higher educa- 
tion the speaker thought he would propose the native language, in connection 
with history. However, he did not think the time had come to suddenly dis- 
pense, scornfully, with classical education. 
Ulimann : ‘1 am thoroughly convinced that the only correct thing is to make 
a beginning; to abolish Greek entirely and to retain Latin as an optional study ; 
- that inevitably Latin will drop out of the foundation of higher education in the 
  future and be only a secondary study for those who for practical reasons require 
e Latin vocabulary, for at present this is all the majority of persons need of 
atin. 
“Tf they know enough to understand a little about prescriptions and apothe- 
eary Latin and a few Latin proverbs it is really about all that the majority of 
persons have retained of Latin at the present day, unless one is a scholar and a 
specialist. In the treatment of this matter one constantly meets with the pecul- 
jar fact that the advocates of the classical languages constantly confound the 
subject of which they treat with the object in view. People talk as though to 
abolish Latin would be leading the people back into the times of barbarism. 
They are mistaken. To do away with Latin would not be detrimental to educa- 
tion. Latin is spoken of as if it were a great educational medium, and it is a 
mistake to-imagine that this special study possesses such an importance,while, 
on the contrary, there are other studies from which more profit can be derived 
during the same length of time. 
“Tt isa great misapprehension that it is really Latin which produces phi- 
 lanthropists, and should lead to human culture. For one may know Latin and 
still be a thoroughly brutal nature. . But that which human education does give 
. is the ability to participate in the great thoughts of culture and civilization of 
mankind ; but one can not do that through Latin as the only means. On ac- 
count of the study of Latin many other studies must be set aside that are most 
preus sources of culture. Isay this because I have heard rumors that possi- 
ly a direct proposition is to ke made to adopt new school regulations—namely, 
such as are based upon the order that Latin be optional without exception. 
“To such a motion I, for my part, shall give my consent with great pleasure, 
for I must admit that owing to the small remainder of philological conscience, 
which has nearly been ground up in the mill of my examinations, if there 
is anything unprofitable and foolish ia the world for us Germanic people to do 
itis, above all things, the study of Latin. There is nothing gained by it, but 
a certain formaleducation which can be acquired as well through other studies, 
while in the mean time life and reality derive no benefit from this study.” 
Hertzberg (from Christiania, a former minister of education, a theologian): 
“So far as the two gentlemen are concerned who, as professors, occupy such im- 
portant positions in our high schools, I must admit that their utterances have 
surprised me not a little. They are both, to my knowlegge, men who not only 
work with zeal in the interests of the high schools, and especially as teachers 
of the classical languages, but they also understand how to awaken interest for 
. these studies in their pupils. ‘They must either fail to comprehend themselves, 
or they are in a very unenviable position, having to perform a tusk the value 
and importance of which they doubt. In opposition to this point of view, allow 
me to say, that 1 believe that classical education has withstood many a test and 
_ storm, much stronger and severer than that of to-day, and I trust that, also, in 
the future it will go through ordeals without being injured. Classical study 
has taken such firm root in the general European culture, that it has become a 
member of it, so to speak.-. And it will not do to pretend that this classical edu- 
cation is something antiquated. 
‘No, classical education can not become antiquated, it can not die, for it has 
grown up with the history of man from its infancy. The classical languages 
mark the way to learning that the generations must take, if they strive toreach 
the height of the culture of to-day, in case they do not wish‘ to exclude them-

selves from this great work of general education that is now in progress in all 
“eivilized countries. Permit me to draw your attention especially to the im- 
portance of classical studies for our church, In case Greek should be omitted 
from our high schools, preparatory to the university, or in case it be postponed 
until the university years, I fear that this will give a mortal blow to the Protes- 
tant Church.” 
Ullmann: ‘When the delegate from Christiania, Mr. Hertzberg, tells us that 
classical education had stood many tests and weathered many a storm, and will -_ 
continue todo so, I deny most positively the supposition from which he proceeds. — 
Classical education has not withstood a single blow. All the assaults that haye 
been made on this education have only caused philologists to open the door to 
the demandsof the times, in that they haye admitted first one and then another 
of the modern branches, and have given them a place by the side of their much- 
beloved Latin and Greek. They have dons this with continual warfare and con- 
stant fear that they would lose their Latin and Greek, because mankind has be- 
come so godless that it wishes for other things than to wander in Ciceronian 
fields. No, classical education has stood no tests and warded off no assaults, but 
it has understood how to accommodate itself, and in this respect ithas been very 
clever. It has filled the course with such a number of branches, beside Latin 
and Greek, thatit sueceeded in meeting the most pressing needs and demands, and 
hence we have obtained an organization which sutfers from a multitude of studies. 
Never were the schools so crowded with studiesas now. Thiscondition is ample 
proof of the fact that classical education is ‘piping on the last hole.’ What re- 
mains to be doneis to givea last decisive blow, so that the latest modern changes 
become the dominant influences. The mojern branches have found their way 
into school, and now they are there by right and to be extended, while the classic 
branches become subordinate ; their final elimination is only a question of time.” 
Ill. Dr. Karl Walcker (in Politik der coustitutionellen Staaten. Karlsruhe, 
Germany, 1890): 
‘“The Greeks were at least as much indebted to Oriental culture as we are to. 
the Greeco-Roman, but it did not occur to them to require of every gentleman 
(xatde ca dyadic) the knowledge of Oriental languages. Many portions of the 
Old Testament are more beautiful and important than all Graeco-Roman classics 
taken together; but for this reason the students of gymnasia are not compelled 
tolearn the Hebrew language (exe>pting, perhaps, future theologians). Further- * 
more, one must not forget what all European nations owe to the ancients, includ- 
ing the Egyptians, the Hindoostanees, and especially the Assyrians. Shall our 
students for this reason learn Egyptian, Sanscrit, and Assyrian? It is worthy 
of notice that a philological professional man of conservative political tendency, 
the celebrated national economist, W. Roscher, justly asserts that on} may 
become acquainted with the classics through good translations in the same man- 
ner in which most learned and educated men know the Bible from Luther’s 
translation. Even future theologians, philosophers, nonclassical: philologists, 
jurists, national economists, and physicians need not pursue the ancient languages 
in the way in which professors of secondary schools pursue them, Latin and - i 
Greek compositions are not necessary for them. 
‘*Tatin has long ceased to be the international language of the learned. For 
international intercourse, at the present day, English and French are us2d. 
The Berlin Labor Congress in the spring of 1890, for example, held its discus- 
sions in French. As far as I can s2e, future Christian theologians and scholars 
in Hebrew will never make Hebrew compositions. It would be absurd to assert 
that a country parson needs no English; that the Assyrian researches of the — 
Englishmen:and Anglo-American works and periodicals have no interest for 
him. Every intelligent person, generally speaking, must understand at least as 
much English as German students of gymnasia on an average understand French. 
It is to be regretted that English is not an obligatory study in gymnasia. In 
consequence of this 95 to 99 per cent of German students of law and national 
economy, prepared in classical gymnasia, understand no English. They make 
blunders in the pronunciation of the most ordinary words, and can not translate 
even the shortest, easiest English sentences. For philologists, national econo- 
mists, jurists, naturalists, etc., the knowledge of English is indispensable.” 
IV. Professor Dr. Herman Cohn (Breslau, Germany) in Die Schule der Zu- 
kunft, Hamburg, 1890: : 
“That the ancient languages will-claim much less time in the future than at 
present is quite certain. In the Middle Ages Latin and Greek were quite in- 
place; to-day their details have become quite superfluous. It has been caleu- 
lated that students of gymnasia spend 4,066 hours in the schools in the study of
-P-A-G-E-604
  : Ss « aes Me s 
1196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  _ Latin and Greek alone, not including work done at home. The student of med- 
icine, on the contrary, spends only 2,160 hours for his preparation, even when he 
attends the clinics four hours every day for five semesters. * And’what has the 
student gained by his 4,056 hours? He knows bad Latin, which with genuine 
joy he strives to forget, and he knows less Greek, which he succeeds in forget- 
ting without effort. 
“The grammatocrats, as Prof. Esmarch so beautifully calls them, of course 
maintain thatthe grammatical exercises are mental gymnastics. I donotbelieve, 
however, that anyone can prove that the mental gymnastics are stronger when 
the beginner memorizes ‘amo, amas, amat,” that when he learns ‘j’aime, tu 
aimes, il aime,’ or ‘I love, thou lovest, he loves.’ Virchow justly affirms, ‘ that 
the ancient languages have somewhat of an ideal purpose, is only an opinion of 
obstinate philologists.’ - They naturally will always stubbornly uphold an idea 
which seems to live like an eternal malady, namely: ‘The ancient languages 
sharpen the mind more than the modern,’ for these men gain their livelihood by 
teaching the ancient languages. Grammatical instruction in general, however, 
does not afford mental gymnastics at all in any language, as is so brilliantly 
proven in the writings of Prof. Lowenthal; for memorizing grammatical rules is 
not brain work, but only cramming with words without meaning, which posi- 
_ tively none of the present needs of children demand. 
“Tam far from wishing to deny the beauties of the Latin and Greek classics; 
but who will not acknowledge that there are also many beautiful things con- 
tained in Sanscrit and Hebrew books? And yet we are contented with good 
translations of these. It is also true of the ancient classics that only he who 
- completely masters the languages can appreciate their beauty, and students of 
gymnasia do not progress asfaras that. Gutzkowis quite correct in his theory 
that ‘ one will not discover the treasures of antiquity until one reads the classics 
in the schools in good translations, and leave the study of the original texts to 
scholars.’ 
“But as things are now, the most important time is squandered in studying 
grammatical and philological vexations of the dead languages, and especially in 
superfluous inverted translations from German into Latin and Greek, which in 
the schools of the future will have to give way to much more important things— 
the modern languages (French and English, which the citizen of the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries finds absolutely necessary for life), mathematics, history, 
literature, geography, physics, chemistry, all of which for training the mind 
- are incomparably more important than all the dead languages taken together. 
  Also drawing, athletic sport, and manual labor will receive more attention than 
formerly. For in a harmonious development the hand will demand more con- 
sideration than is bestowed upon it now.” 
V. Dr. Paul Gissfeld (Berlin) in Die Erziehung der deutschen Jugend, Berlin, 
1890; 
“Graduates of the secondary school of the future who enter the university 
will be lacking much knowledge with which at present the students are quite 
familiar. They will not be masters of Greek and Latin grammar, nor be able to 
read the ancient authors in the or al. This concerns philologists first, then 
lawyers, historians, and theologians. As Hebrew is a professional study of the 
theologians which is acquired in the university,so Latin and Greek will intime 
to come be taught there, and thereonly. It would seem best for that purpose 
to eStablish seminaries in connection with universities for the special benefit of 
those students only who have a vital interest in learning the classical languages. 
Their diligence will be greater, their progress much faster, for the simple rea- 
son that by virtue of their general intellectual culture they will be able to un- 
derstand the grammar the more easily. 
“The modern language which as a medium of culture and as a substitute for 
Greek and Latin deserves consideration above all others is the French. Its ad- 
vantages are chiefly found in the grammar, which resembles in lucidity a Code 
Napoleon. Its rules are strict and clear. One dogs not venture to violate them, 
but enjoys following them. This feature may be traced through the entire 
French literature, and no revolution could effect any change in this. There is 
nothing holy and sublime in France that has not been dragged into the mud by 
party or faction; but no one dared to touch the language with unholy hands. 
Respect for the French language is shown everywhere in France, from the 
hastily penned advertisement.of the merchant to the orations of the immortals 
in the French Academy, and every violation of the rules of that language is pun- 
ished severely with ridicule. There-is no room left for arbitrary construction 
  in syntax, as is claimed in German and Latin by every writer andspeaker. But
-P-A-G-E-605

. as a substitute for that want of liberty there is offered a wealth of words signi- 
fying similar things, so that the finest shading in expression is made possible. 
‘hus it comes that the French language is equally well fitted for the presenta-

tion of mathematical theories and the expression of the most charming play of 
poetic thought. 
“To master such a language, so that one may be able to express one’s 
thoughts fluently in it without violating its grammar or groping for proper 
terms, is an object worthy of the highest human intellect and the most culti- 
vated taste. The way to it, moreover, has the advantage of leading through 
alternately charming and grand but ever beautiful sceneries—French litera- 
ture. He who sees in French litzrature only an accumulation of novels full of 
adultery betrays himself by his unjust and distorted judgment. Nor need we 
restrict ourselves in school to contemporaneous literature. If we exelude it 
there would still remain the works of many centuries to choose from.” 
4.—CiTy SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Germany—The city of Berlin had in 1890-91, 290 public elementary schools 
and 82 private and Jewish schools; together, 352. An increase of 3 schools, 111 
class rooms, and 3,518 pupils. _The Protestant population in Berlin has increased 
18 per cent within the last 5 years, the Catholic population 36 per cent, and the 
Jewish 23 per.cent. The actual increase is 210,038 Protestants, 35,825 Catholics, 
and 14,881 Jews. Fourteen per cent of the Protestant population were found in the 
lower public schools; only 10 per ‘cent of the Catholic, but 15 per cent of the 
Jewish population. Of the 3,141 classes in the lower schools, 3,021 had their 
own class rooms}; 120 had to share class rooms with other classes; this was done 
by introducing half-day schools, Since 1889-90, the number of classes in houses 
belonging to the city has increased by 202, while the number of classesin rented 
quarters has decreased by 133. Half day instruction is given to children in pri- 
mary grades and to those employed in factories. The schools of Berlin, though 
fully graded, have not.as with us 8, but 6 grades. The following figures are 
instructive: of all the pupils there were in the lowest grade (1 year) 19 per cent; 
second grade (1 year) 19 per cent; third grade (1 year) 19 per cent; fourth grade 
(1 year) 18 per cent; fifth grade (2 years) 14 per cent; sixth grade (2 years) 11 
er cent. 
P This isa distribution which few American schools can equal. What American 
school has still 11 per cent of its school population in the seventh and eighth 
grades? Toward the close of the year the average number of pupils to the ~ 
teacher was 55. Besides the 3,141 teachers and 352 principals there is another 
corps of teachers engaged in the city schools, namely, the women who teach the 
girls to knit, embroider, sew, ete. Since 1863, when the first women teachers 
were employed, 1,325 have™been in active service. Of these 956 were still in 
active service in 1891; 369 have dropped out (273 resigned, 222 of them have 
married, 32 were promoted to higher schools, 25 were pensioned, 39 died). It is 
found that the women teachers were absent on an average 8} days per year 
within the first 5 years of service. The absence increased to 224 days per year 
up to the fourteenth year of service. Up to the nineteenth year the average 
annual absences amounted to 8} days; up to the twenty-ninth and thirtieth it 
inereased to 8} days, until in the forty-second years of age the absence amounted 
to 15.8 days. The calculations are not a good basis, for they offer too slender a 
premise. An anomaly is the fact, that in 35 Protestant city schools of Berlin 
Instruction in Hebrew religion is given to the children of that faith. Another 
notable fact is that 18 principals, 91 male and 109 female and 16 industrial teach- 
ers asked for and received leave of absence or prolongation on account of im- 
paired health. (Paed. Ztg.) s 
Austria.—Vienna has recently annexed its suburbs and thereby increased the 
number of its primary schools from 170 with 2,300 teachers, to 285 schools with 
3,800 teachers and 140,000 pupils. Berlin had, in 1890, 184 schools with 3,800 
teachers and 172,778 pupils. 
5.—COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE. 
The following countries have laws on their statute books which decree com-* 
pulsory attendance at elementary schools. In many of these countries the law 
is of recent origin, hence has not had the results it will show 10 or 20 years” 
hence. In England the law leaves it to local authorities to decree compulsory 
_ attendance at school, if they see fit.

(Accord, to Statesman’ s Yearbook.) 
Germany.—In Berlin 1,900 pupils of the public elementary schools were, in 
1891, definitely excused from school at the close of the seventh year (at 13 years 
of age), owing to the poverty of the parents, who needed their children’s aid. 
In 50 families, it was conclusively shown, the misery was so great that the chil- 
dren had to be excused at 12 years of age. The compulsory attendance law 
_ leayes such cases to be decided by the supervisory authority, to whom is given _ 
a wide margin of discretion. (Ir. pacd. Blaetter.) 
England.—Concerning compulsory attendance at school in England, there is 
little known in this country, hence a plain statement of facts may be welcome. 
The “elementary educational act” of August 9, 1870, provides as follows: 
“Every school board may, from time to time, with the approval of the educa- 
tion department, make by-laws for all or any of the following purposes: Re- 
quiring the parents of children of such age—not less than 5-years, nor more 
than 13 years—as may be fixed by the by-laws, to cause such children (unless 
there is some reasonable excuse) to attend school; imposing penalties for the 
breach of any by-laws. Any of the following grounds shall be a reasonable 
excuse: namely, (1) that the child is under efficient instructions in some other 
manner; (2) that the child has been prevented from attending school by sick- 
mess or any unavoidable cause; (3) that there is no public elementary school 
open which the child can attend within such distance—not exceeding 3 miles, 
measured according to the nearest road from the residence of such child—as the 
by-laws may prescribe. Thes2 by-laws were issued by the different school 
poards sanctioned by Her Majesty in council and published inthe appendices to 
the annual reports of the education department. There still existed boroughs 
and parishes enough which did nothing at all in this matter. 
To amend this elementary act, other acts were passed in 1873, 1876, 1879, and 
1880, among which that of 1876 is most important as to compulsory attendance. 
Seetions 4 and-12 of chapter 79 run as follows: (4) It shall bé the duty of the 
parent oi every child to cause such child to receive efficient elementary instruc- 
tion in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and if such parent fail to perform such 
duty, he shall be liable to such orders and penalties as are provided by this act. 
(12) Where an attendance order is not complied with without any reasonable 
excuse, a court of summary jurisdiction, on complaint made by the local author- 
ity, may, if it think fit, order as follows: In the first case of noncompliance, if 
the parent of the child does not appear, or appears and fails to satisfy the court 
that he used all reasonable efforts to enforce compliance with the order, the 
court may impose a penalty not exceeding, with the cost, 5s.; but if parent sat- 
isfi-s the court that he has used all reasonable efforts as aforesaid, the court 
may, without inflicting a penalty, order the child to be sent to a certified day 
industrial school. Moreover, this act provides for the appointment of a school 
attendance committee for every borough and parish for which a school board 
has not been elected. The act of 1880, which is very short, provides that the 
-education department, may make by-laws for those districts which have not 
made them for themselves. By it compulsion was first fully and universally es- 
tablished. All public elementary schools are administered by these acts, as well 
as by codes, of which anew one is issued every year. (Gust. Lenz.)

FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES. TE 
  > : 6.—CRIME. 
Germany.—The numbers annually published by the German statistical bureau 
concerning crimes in Germany, or the number of convictions, may, in a sense, i 
be considered a harometer of public morals. For several years a gratifying sat- 
isfaction was entertained at the decrease in the number of crimes against prop- 
erty, and it was concluded that the economic conditions of Germany were 
steadily improving. On the other hand, it was considered an ominous sympton 
that the number of crimes against state, public order, and religion, as wellas 
against the person was steadily increasing. It was regarded as a ray of hope 
-when, in 1888, a check in the inerease was noted. That year was (since 1882) 
the first in which a notable decrease in the number of crimes of the second kind 
could be recorded. 
At present the result of the statistical labors for 1889 is before us, but, 
alas, it does not show a continuation of the tendencies marked in 1888, for not — 
’ only the number of crimes against state, public order, religion, and person has 
increased beyond expectations, but also the seemingly constant tendency toward 
decrease in crimes against property has ceased, and the year 1889 exhibits a 
deplorable increase. 
Some characteristic numbers may illustrate the foregoing statements. The 
crimes against state, public order, and religion in 1882 numbered 51,623 (con- 
victions are meant); this number rose until 1887, when it reached 62,348. The 
year 1888 showed adecrease, namely, 61,806 convictions. But the year 1889 again 
records an increase, the sum total during that year being 62,815. Thisinerease ~ 
is chiefly found in the great number of cases of breach of peace (16,244 as against 
14,851 in 1888), inducement toperjury (292as against 221), public resistance (364: 
as against 163), while the number of escapes from service in the army decreased x 
from 21,421 to 19,683. : : 
The number of convictions for crimes against the person was 107,398 in 1882. 
It rose-to 137,745 in 1887. In 1888 it fell to 134,670, but in 1889 it again increased re 
to 139,639. Especially the convictions on acount of verbal offens2 (43,600 against ; 
42,959 in 1888), assaultand battery (19,730 as against 18,374), and inflicting wounds 
(57,191 as against 55,223) show a deplorable increase. 
The crimes against property also exhibited a constant decrease in number 
from 1882 till 1887, namely, from 169,334 to 152,652. But the year 1889 again 
shows @ remarkable increase, namely, to 165,623. In this increase may b2 rec- — a 
ognized the characteristic feature of the criminality of 1889. It indicates adif- _ 
ferent direction from that illustrated by the numbers of 1882. The numbers 
especially interesting are 71,881 cases of petty larceny, (as against 65,060 in 
1888); same with second conviction, 11,085 (as.against 10,185); larceny, 7,978 (as 
against 6,972); burglary, 2,412 (as against 2,160); embezzlement, 15,888 (asagainst ~ 
14,781); defraudation, 15,205 (as against 13,493). es 
The increase of crimes against property is frequently considered to stand in ~ 
intimate relation to the advance in prices of commodities and necessities; but 
it should be remembered that the prices of provisions did not rise until the second 4 
half of the year 1889, and that the general economic conditions of Germany were. 
better in 1889 than in any previous year. Of course, though one is inclined to 
think that the rise in prices hus something to do with causing the increase in 
the number of crimes against property, it can scarcely fully explain it when the 
inerease in these crimes is taken in connection with that of others. One thing 
should be noticed, that during the reign of “‘ protective tariff” a constant reduc- 
tion in the number of crimes against property was noticeable. * 
    How unfavorable the statistics of crime for the year 1889 are, may be seen_

7.—EXHIBITIONS. 
' Italy.—An exhibition was held in Milan in the first week in May, 1891, for the 
education and hygiene cf children. The character of the exhibits is best seen 
from the programme. In ClassI, toys of every description ; in Class H, children’s. 
implements, musical instruments for children, etc.; Class Ill, under the title 
“Tho Little Artist,” a collection of tools for every kind of handiwork; Class 1V, 
containsroom games; Class V, little theaters; Class VI, garden games; Class 
VII, apparatus for gy ‘mnastics, fishing, hunting, swimming, etc.; Class VIII, 
velocipedes, carrousels (merry-go-rounds), swings, and hammocks. While this 
part is an international exhibition, the following is strictly national. It con- 
tains in section 1, text-books and other publications, drawings, models, appar- 
atus for object lessons, furniture and tools for schools and kindergarten ; in sec- 
tion 2, education, apparatus for teaching how to walk, food and clothing for 
children, ete. 
France.—The commission charged with viewing the biennial exhibition of de- 
sign and manual work in the primary schools of the Sarthe district, France, has 
made its report. Itstates that the teaching of design showsa marked tendency. to 
become more rational. Thecopiesof models are rarer and the designs are less ill- 
assorted. Linear design is not proportionally represented, and there are many 
patterns beyond the capacity of the child. The teaching of sewing has made a 
great advance in the line of common sewing and the making of simple garments 
for daily use. The method of teaching and the arrangementof the programmes 
is in need of improvementand revision. Too many teachers succeed in giving the 
little girls a taste for luxury and frivolity, besides causing them a loss of precious 
time. (Lond. Ed. Times.) 
Monsieur Jules Simon has inaugurated a novel and interesting exhibition in 
Paris, organized by the hygienic society for children, a body established four 
years ago for promoting the health and welfare of the young. The exhibits 
_ consist of various kinds of hygienic, orthopedic, and surgical appliances, cloth- 
ing, toys, industrial producis, and other articles intended for the use of chil- 
dren in health or in sickness. The most remarkable feature of the exhibition 
is a very curious and complete collection of quaint cradles, chairs, and gocarts, ~ 
dating, some of them, from extremely remote periods. One of these gocarts 
affords a most curious illustration of primitive ingenuity, having been made by 
hollowing out the trunk of a tree. There are also specimens of baskets and 
bags used by miners’ wives for hanging up their babies while at work and a 
wooden “‘créche,” used for ths reception of foundlings at Lille during the Mid- 
dle Ages. (Lond. Jl. of Ed.) 
The Pedagogical Museum of Paris is a permanent exhibition of all kinds of 
teaching material from abaci and alphabet cards up to the most delicate and 
complicated apparatus, and all the civilized nations of the world are laid under 
contribution. ‘The minister of public instruction has lately decided to enlarge 
its seope by the addition of a section devoted to sample copy books and exercise 
books to show the handwriting of the French youth. The Revue Pedagog- 
ique characterizes the new departure asa happy idea. It quotes at length the 
official circular inviting the codperation of the chief inspector in preparing for 
the exhibition. Every district of France is to be included, but both, the class 
(or grade) of pupils represented, and the variety of schools are to be changed 
from year to year. The caligraphy of both boys and girls is to be shown, and 
each primary inspector is charged to submit threes specimen books from his dis- 
trict. The minister is careful to direct that the books should be the ordinary 
samples, and not specially prepared for transmission to the capital. At the op- 
tion of the inspector the books may contain the teacher’s correction of the day’s 
work. ({Schoolmaster.) 
8.— HYGIENE. 
Germany.—The subject of mental overpressure is important not only for pa- 
rental consideration, but for scientific investigation. The capacity of the child, 
the number and nature of the studies, and especially the length of the recita- 
tions, are features which ought not to be overlooked or be left to the discretion 
of educators. That much can be gained by experimental study of overpressure 
is shown by a paper read by Dr. Burgenstein, of Vienna, before the congress of 
hygiene in London, upon The Working Curve of an Hour. The writer had, 
for his object the study-of the mental power of children, and he arranged his 
experiments with a view to demonstrating the’ fluctuations of brain power in

children during one hour's occupation with a familiar subject. Simple addition 
‘ and multiplication sums were given to two classes of girls, of an average age of 
11 years and 11 years and 10 months, and two classes of boys of the average age 
of 12 years and 2 months, and 13 years.and 1 month. After ten minutes’ work 
the sums were taken away from the children; after a pause of ten minutes the 
work was resumed, the alternation continuing for an hour, so that there were 
three periods of work. The results were interesting. During the experiment 
162 children worked out 135,010 figures, making 6,504 mistakes. It was found 
that the number of mistakes increased in the different periods and that during 
the third period the quality of work was at the lowest. The general result showed, 
according to the investigator, that ‘‘children of the ages stated become fa- 
tigued in three-quarters of an hour; that the organic material is gradually ex- 
hausted; that the power of work gradually diminishes to a certain point during 
the third quarter of the hour, returning-with renewed force at the fourth quar- 
ter.” The recommendation was made that no school lesson should last longer 
than three-quarters of an hour, and should be followed by a quarter of an hour’s 
rest. Such a study is of especial benefit at the beginning of the school year. 
Children are often reprimanded for inattention when they are overfatigued, 
and are spuirred forward when their minds need rest. ‘‘ Merftal overpressure” 
is the usual result. (London Journal of Education.) 
In Germany an experiment was tried upon 162 children from 11 to 13 years of 
age, who were set to work out sums in simple addition and multiplication for ten 
minutes; then after five minutes’ rest, for ten minutes more, and so on for four 
periods of ten minutes each in all. The result was that the total number of mis- 
takes made was 6,504, the number increasing in the second and third period, but 
diminishing again in the fourth, which appears to have been better than the 
second. Regarding this as an experiment upon overpressure, the first thing that, - 
suggests itself is, that forty minutes of simple arithmetic, divided into periods 
of ten minutes each, with an interval of rest between, seems such a small 
amount of work to produce symptoms of fatigue that one is led to ask whether 
there may not have been some other cause to account for the deterioration 
observed? How were the intervals of rest employed? Isit not probable that 
such frequent interruptions may have produced a feeling of distraction and loss 
of concentration sufficient. in itself to account for the falling off in the quality 
of the work? Again, 6,504 mistakes gives an average of one mistake per 
minute for every child; surely work so careless can not have been the cause of 
much mental pressure. It seems strange, too, on the evidence, that three-quar- 
ters of an hour should be proposed as the limit, taking no account, apparently, 
of the revival of energy in the last ten minutes of the hour, (London Ed.

France.—A convention of school physicians in Paris has unanimously rec- 
ommended to the city school authorities to provide every school with a set of 
surgical instruments for cases of emergency. Injuries, as they sometimes oc- 
eur in schools, could then be attended to without delay by the teachers. 
Sweden.—Dr. Wertlind, physician in the schools at Gotenburg, Sweden, has 
weighed the pupils of three girls’ schools twice a year since 1870. During his 
observations, for the period of twenty years, he found that the increase in weight 
during the three vacation months (June, July, and August) was comparatively 
greater than during. the remaining nine school months. » The following table

‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The Prussian Paidagogische Zeitung says: 
_ . From this table it is seen that after the eighth year of age the development of 
girls during the nine school months is not proportional to that which takes 
place during the three vacation months. Up to 9 years of age the girls are not 
materially checked in their bodily development, but from that year on the de- 
velopment is checked the more the older the pupils are. We must also, in 
scanning this table, remember that, as a general thing, the summer is not con- 
ducive to an accumulation of flesh and fat; hence these figures are more elo- 
quent than would seem at first. But it does not follow from the facts here pre- 
_ sented that it would seem better to keep the pupils out of school. All that 
follows is that school instruction should be attended by less worry and more 
cheerful play. ,If our girls must acquire mental development at the cost of ner- 
yous prostration, as is done so frequently, it certainly is too costly an article.

-  Denmark.—A Danish school principal in Copenhagen, Dr. Vahl, publishes the 
result of his similar observations through a period of nine years. He weighed 
his pupils twice a year, on April 1 and October1. His observations are very 
valuable, since thgy embraced children of prescholastic age. The remarkable 
fact was found that during the six summer months the increase in weight was 
on an average about one-third greater than through the winter months. Here

Ger many. —While the German nation has the smallest per cent of illiteracy of ~ 
any nation in the world, yet neither the Catholic nor the Protestant element has ~ 
the lowest rate of illiteracy. This belongs to the Jewish element. Of100 Prot- 
estant children 91.63 per cent attend the elementary, 4.87 per cent the middle, 
25 per cent the high school, and .25 per cent the university. For 100 Catholic 
children the 4 departments run respectively 97.21, 4.18, 1.48, and .13. _ While for 
the Jews the per cent in 100 children is 53.71, 24. 40, 21. 30, and 1.69. That is, of 
Catholic and Protestant children about 10 in'100 go bey ond the first or elemen- 
tary grade, while 47 in 100 of the Jewish children go beyond the first grade. 
These figurés apply only to the city of Berlin, however, where the Jews are both 
- numerous and wealthy. This isamostremarkable revelation, and the advantage 
is with Jewish children, not in Berlin alone, butalsothroughoutthe empire. It 
is said that the same fact holds true in our American schools. Why is it that 
the Jewish mind aspires to the highest plane in education? It would look as 
though the higher average of health among the Jewish race leads to a greater 
measure of mental activity and sustainsit. The greater average in wealth also 
helps to the same end. The study is an interesting one, and a comparison of 
statistics covering all nations would be desirable. :

10—LANGUAGE STUDY. 
: Learning languages through self-instruction.—In an age like ours that brings peo- 
ple of foreign tongues into contact so often, an age in which the polyglot litera- 
ture of periodicals and books plays an important réle, the number of adults who 
learn foreign languages through self-help is by no means small. Each of these 
self-made linguists is likely to have his own method and reach the goal he sets 
for himself in his own inimitable way. But though every road leads to Rome, a 
sensible pilgrim will want to know several to choose from. For this reason such 
quiet indefatigable workers may be reminded of the methods of two men who, 
by means of self-instruction, acquired an unusually great amount of linguistic 
_ kowledge and have become famous in this respect—Schliemann and Macaulay. 
Schliemann, the distinguished German archeologist, who ‘‘first served as a 
commercial clerk, then, when he became head of a commercial house doing an 
extended and successful business, learned English, French, Dutch, Spanish, Por- 
tuguese, and Russian; later on, modern and ancient Greek: lastiy, Latin.” He 
writes of himself in his Ilios: ‘‘ Then I occupied myself for two years exclusively 
- with ancient Greek literature and, I may say, I read cursorily during this time 
    nearly all the classics, and the Iliad and Odysseyseveral times. Of Greek gram- 
mar | merely learned the declensions and the regular and irregular verbs; but 
with grammar rules [ lost not a minute of my precious time, for when I saw that 
not a single one of all the boys who had been tortured with tedious grammar 
rules for more than eight years was able afterwards to write a Greek letter with- 
out making hundreds of the coarsest errors, I concluded that the method fol- 
lowed in the high schools was radically wrong. My opinion is that one can gain 
a thorough knowledge of Greek or any grammar only through practice, 7. e., 
through thoughtful and attentive reading of classic prose, and through memo- 
rizing some of its best model pieces. Following the primitive method, I learned 
ancient Greek, and now can use it like a living language. I fluently write in it, 
and orally express my thoughts readily and without difficulty on any given sub- 
ject, provided always I have thoughts to express on that subject. I am familiar 
with all the rules of grammar, though I rarely know whether the rules I follow 
in gpeech and writing are recorded in grammar or not.” Schliemann fails to tell 
aller he read the first Greek work. Doubtless he diait with the aid of a trans- 
lation, and not with a dictionary. 
Lord Macaulay, the great English historian, learned modern languages in like 
manner. ‘When Iwanttolearnalanguage,” he wrote from Calcutta in 1836, ‘‘I 
always begin with the Bible, which I canread without a dictionary (Macaulay 
knew the English New Testament by heart). In the course of a few days I know 
the patch words (prepositions and conjunctions), and the commonest syntactical 
rules, and come into possession of a pretty large vocabulary. Then Lattack some 
goodclassic work. Thus I learned Spanish and Portuguese, anda similar method 
Ishallsome day employ in learning German.” <A year later he wrote: “On my 
way home Lintend tolearnGerman. Iam told thatisa difficultlanguage, butI do 
not believe that there is any language which I can not master in four months,

working 10 hours daily.” And a few months later: ‘‘ When I arrivein England" 
I mean to have mastered German. In my leisure hours I have broken the ice 
by reading Luther’s translation of the New Testamenthalf through, andl amnow - 
quickly making my way through Schiller’s history of the Thirty Year’s War. 
Schiller’s style pleasesme very much. His history is rich in very correct and 
profound thoughts, expressed in so simple and pleasing a language that only 
blockheads can think him superficial. 
The prodigious knowledge of languages of a Macaulay or Schliemann are usu- 
ally explained by the supposition that they possessed an extraordinary licgnistic 
talent. However, that may bea fallacy. If we consider that these linguistic 
genuises were always persons who permitted themselves no other recreation and 
pleasure than reading, and consequently employed every available moment in_ 
reading, we shall look upon the wonderful results mentioned rather as a feat of 
enormous diligence and incessant practice. What Macaulay, outside of his pro- 
fessional and literary activity read, is truly fabulous. It seems as though he had 
read every English book published; the bad and unimportant books once, classi¢ 
works repeatedly, and the historians (both English and foreign) incessantly. 
Hence the English saying: ‘‘A book which has not been read by anybody, save 
Macaulay.” 
On his way home from India he read Schiller’s and Gcethe’s complete works, 
Miller’s Swiss History, some works of Tieck and Lessing, as well as the works 
of other less noted German authors. In a letter to his sister he writes: “I 
have during the entire voyage read with grand enjoyment, having devoured 
Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, French, and English ; folios, quarto, octavo,and 
other volumes.” And to a friend he wrote more in detail: ‘* I have read with a 
truly voracious appetite the Iliad and the Odyssey, Virgil, Horace, Caesar's 
Memoirs, Bzcon’s De Augmentis, Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, Tasso, Don Quixote, 
Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of Rome, Mill’s India, all the 70 volumes of Voltaire, 
Sismondi’s History of France, and the seven thick folio volumes of the Biographia - 
Brittanica.” Critical and esthetic views, together with notes upon the impres- 
sions some of these works had made upon him, or upon the rising or sinking of 
an author in his estimation after having read him, form the conclusion of his —   
letter, sae 
Concerning the manner of his reading, he says ‘‘I do not read any longer as I 
read in college, but like aman of the world. If I come across a word I do not~ 
know I pass it unless it be that its sen-e is essential for the comprehension of 
the sentence.” 
Bulwer-Lytton, the romance writer, dramatist, and politician, expresses himself 
in a schcol oration concerning regular work as preferable to inborn linguistic 
talent by saying: ‘‘Only he can really accomplish much who does not attempt — 
too much at one time. Ihave traveled much, have occupied much of my time 
with politics and other public and private business, and besides, have written 
more than 60 volumes, some on subjects which required much study and search- 
ing investigation. And now, how much time do you believe, my young hearers, 
I spent in study on an average, that is, in reading and writing? Thrée hours a 
day. and when Parliament is in session, even less. But during these hours my 
heart and soul are enlisted. It is therefore not. necessary, that in order to ac- 
complish much intellectual work, one should attempt to do much at atime; but it 
‘is absolutely essential that he work regularly and every day. If once a week you 
pour a whole tub full‘of water on a stone, no impressicn is made, but if you con- 
tinually let a drop fall on it, the proverb tells you that the stone will be worn 
away.” 
From the foregoing we may take two lessons: (a) Do not base the study of a 
fereign language upon a grammar (with vocabulary, rules, ete.), but upon a work 
written in the respective language. (b) Work regularly and daily. - 
To use the same method with adults and young people would, however,not 
seem advisable. The school method must needs be different from the method 
of the adult ‘‘autodidact,” self-teacher. The pupil is young and has a teacher 
who stimulates him; the autodidact has a mature mind and learns without a 
teacher and without stimulants. He who stands between the two as a link, is 
the student of the upper classes of secondary schools, the young man of 16 to 20 
years of age. This youth is ripening in judgment and character and may, or 
ought to be led to treat himself as the autodidact does. When he enters life or 
a university he will be the better enabled to cope with difficulties, the more he 
has ‘earned to help and teach himself. The ‘‘joy of learning” this wonderful 
stimulus must not be quenched by too much assistance. (After Schweiz- 
Lehrerztg.) ‘

   : 11.—LIBRARIES FOR PUPILS AND TEACHERS. 
School Libraricsin France.—There can be no doubt that the inhabitants of large 
cities can find the necessary and desirable hooks for recreative and instructive 
reading without difficulty, even though they may not have a well arranged pub- 
lic library such as nearly all American cities have. But it is quite a different 
thing in the country. Both the collection of books as well as the proper persons 
. to advise in the purchase of books, are often wanting. This is the case in France 
more than in other countries: The inconveniences—want of books for those 
who have left the schools, and a proper person who could makea suitable selec- ~~ 
tion in the purchase of books—have been met in France by establishing libraries 
_-in the city and village schoolhouses, the use of which is free for pupils and 
adults. 
As early as the year 1860, M. Roland, the then minister of instruction, or- 
- dered that in the building plans of schoolhouses, the expense of which is partly 
- borne by the state, should provide for a suitabl2 library room, This order in- 
- directly stimulated the establishment of school libraries. Previous to that, 
pooks had been procured, but despite liberal expenditures, the collection had 
melted away, owing, no doubt, to the want of proper supervision and adminis- 
tration. 
~ A ministerial order of June 1, 1860, which with slight changes is still in force 
regulated the organization of new libraries. Article 1 of this order made it 
obligatory to establish a library in every public school which should contain 
(a) the books used by th» pupils in the schoolroom and others to aid them in 
their studies; (b) instructive and entertaining works for the usé of adults. The 
library should be placed under the supervision and management of a teacher of 
the school, and should at all times be subject to the inspection of the supervisory 
~ school authorities. 
Of course the selection of books to b> purchased offered various difficulties, 
hence it was determined that the school inspector of the district should pass 
judgment over the selection. However, it was soon found that this unduly 
increased the duties of the inspectors, burdened as they were, with. the super- 
vision of instruction and the keeping of ords. Hence the minister of instruc- 
tion created a permanent library commission, who were instructed to make and 
publish lists and catalogues of books suitable for pupils as well as for rural 
communities. This commission entered into an agreement with one of the 
largest publishing houses in Paris, which was to furnish the books mentioned 
in the catalogue io communities at reduced prices. The first catalogue of this 
commission appeared in 1868. 
Aside of this action onthe part of the Government, several bequests of pri- 
vate persons and subsequent State appropriations have made the rapid growth, 
and spread of these libraries possible. While in 1864 France had only 4,873 of 
such school libraries, it had in 1878 20,871; and in 1889 their number had in- 
creased to 36,326. The number of volumes borrowed was 5,576,586 in 1889. The 
money derived from private persons, communal and provincial authorities, 
amounted to 4,680,689 franes in 11 years, from 1878 until 1889. During the same 
time the minister of instruction spent 2,250,000 francs for the establishment and 
~ maintenance of these libraries from appropriations made by the state for his 
departinent. 
_ Now, as regards the rules and regulations in forces, they date from the year 
1862, as has already been stated, and have not since essentially changed, except 
the law of June 16, 1881, which decreed abolishment of tuition fees, affected 
these libraries; for since the school assumed the character of gratuitiveness a 
great number of very poor children entered it. Hence, the number of free text- 
books had to be materially increased, which necessitated strict economy and ~ 
even temporary cessation of the purchase of books for adults until the state came 
to the rescue. 
It is quite interesting to peruse the catalogues published by the permanent 
library commission, the last one of which was published in 1888. It mentions 
2,594 works, among which we find alphabetically and topically arranged diction- 
     
   
  
  
    
  
     
-P-A-G-E-615
         ‘ ; “porno EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 1207 
‘aries, biographies, a books of travel, literature, national economy, 
morals, hygiene, agriculture, “history of art, and miscellaneous books: Authors 
and “publishers submit their works for examination, if they wish to have them 
recommended by the commission. The titles of those inspected and found suit-. 
able are first published in the bulletin admiuistratif of the minister; after that 
they are inserted in the catalogues of the commission. 
Tn order to cause the local school authorities as little expense as possible the 
mails transmit the books without postage, just as the United States Government 
does its own publications. Usually several communities combine to send one — 
order blank filled out to the minister, who hands it over to the publisher with 
whom the agreement has been made. 
According to the last census France had 36,121 communities. Ii we compare ” 
with this number the number of school libraries in existence, namely 35,336, it 
wouldseem as though every community of France had one or more of such li- 
braries. That is, however, not the case. A great many large-communities have 
several schools, while in some places a common library exists for two schools. 
In 1889 France had 25,402 boys’, 23,452 girls’, and 18,681 mixed schools, a total of 
67,515. Now, if we compare the number of school libraries with this total num- ~ 
ber of schools we find that there are still 31,189 schools without a library. 
The reports, which we have quoted at length, demand establishment of new 
libraries and increased purchase of books in order to promote the intellectual — 
culture of the people. We read, ‘‘ Every government of France, since the year 
1789, has bestowed attention upon intellectual liberation of the people. Since 
the decree of the year 1894, which ordered that common gratuitous instruction 
should be introduced for all citizens and all stata of society until June 16, 
1881, which brought the famous law that was the crowning of the work begun 
  nearly ahundred 4 years ago, the most distinguished men of France and lawgivers ms 
have occupied themselves with the necessity of intellectual development of the 
people through instruction and education. “But school instruction can have an 
abiding result only when the pupils, after leaving school, are offered opportuni- 
ties for further development.” This correct, although not everywhere appre- 
ciated idea, gave rise to the establishment of continuation schools. However, 
this course of instruction, excellent as if may be, can not do all that is desirable, 
because French children go to work at a much earlier age than is customary in 
other countries; hence the absolute necessity of libraries. The countryman in 
the hamlet, the laborer in town, all find in them sources of instruction and rec- 
reation. Books at home are the most natura] coinplement of school instruc- 
tion. (After L. Fleischer.) i 
Pedagogical libraries in France.—The French pedagogical libraries, intended 
for the exclusive use of teachers, are in organic connection with the cantonal 
(or township) school conferences. A statute of February 10, 1837;mentions them 
first, and article 15 orders that they be preserved and increased by means of 
contributions of teachers, or other gifts and bequests. But when in 1849 all ed- 
ucational meetings were prohibited, on account of apprehension of their becom- 
ing political clubs, the libraries ‘‘melted away.” In 1875 they wererevived. A 
ministerial decree of January 4, 1876, promised active assistance on the part of © 
the central government, which ‘ ‘recognized the just demands of many teach- 
ers for professional libraries.” A later order, dated May 15, 1879, created a com- ~ 
_mission which was charged with designing a plan of organization for libraries, 
the object of which was to acquaint teachers with the best books and methods 
of teaching for elementary schools, This commission, of which the minister of 
public education was chairman, resolved to leave the establishment of such 
libraries to private enterprise, and confined its labors to issuing a catalogue con- 
taining the titles of books that deserved to bestudied. This catalogue was pub- 
lished in 1880; a second, much larger, edition appeared in 1888. (Memoires et

contains this catalogue). Since 1880 the credit opened by the central government 
for teachers’ libraries that had been made available by placing them in school 
houses, was raised 20,000 frances ($4,000); besides this sum, the mihister of edu- 
cation allows the management of these libraries 30,000 franes ($6,000) annually. 
The management of these teachers’ libraries is not uniform throughout: the 
many departments of France. The different rules and regulations in force Vary, 
considerably. Hence, in order to obtain an insight into the ‘working of the 
libraries the different regulations would have to ba compared. Most of the 
libraries are the result of codperation on the part of teachers. When a re- 
“spectable nucleus is formed the Government recognizes the institution and 
subsidizes it. The following are the leading rules: ‘ 
     
-P-A-G-E-616
1208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
  Art. 2. This library is designed to supplement the private collection of hooks 
owned by teachers; it shall contain chiefly pedagogical works. It is under © 
supervision of the school inspector of the “arrondissement” or ‘‘canton”’ (or 
school district as wellas communal unit); a teacher of the district acts as libra- 
rian and treasurer. 
Art. 3, The library is empowered toaccept gifts and bequests in form of funds 
or books, but no book is to be placed on its shelves without the sanction of the 
“inspector of the academy” (or provincial school inspector). 
met. 4. A *‘ founder of the library ” is every one who pays an annual fee of at 
least 20 frances; A ‘‘contributor” he who paysan annual fee of at least 5 francs. 
The names of founders and contributors are placed in a conspicuous place in the 
hall of the library. 
ART. 5. All teachers of public schools who desire to make use of the library 
are members after the payment of 2 francs per annum. 
ART. 6. The library is managed by a committee of the school inspector, the 
jibrarian, and three teachers, annually elected by the members. Their func- 
tions are performed without remuneration. 
AR?. 7. This committee meets at least four times a year ; it determines upon 
the purchase and acceptation or rejection of books given to the library; it re- 
ports upon its negotiations with authors, publishers, and private persons, etc. 
Its accounts are submitted to discussion of the teachers’ conference. 
ART. 8. At the meeting of the conference which takes place in December, » 
the annual report of the treasurer is submitted. 
ART. 14. The period for which a book may be borrowed must notexceed four 
weeks; 5 centimes fine are to bs paid for each additional day. 
These libraries are generally found at the central town of a‘‘ canton,” in which 
the meetings are held; they are placed in schoolhouses centrally located. The 
minister of education presents each library annually with thirty to forty books      
   
_ selected from the official catalogue mentioned above. Certain city governments 
have recognized the importance of these libraries and opened an account for 
them in their budgets. Thus the city authorities of Toulon pay 600 francs per 
year to enable the teachers’ library to subscribe for the most distinguished edu- 
“cational periodicals. The catalogue referred to contains three divisions, namely, 
(1) scientific works, (2) works upon education (theory and practice, psychology 
and history of education), and (8) reference books, to which division belong all 
official reports on education, home and foreign. 
A desirable extension of the usefulness of these libraries is found in the so- 
called pedagogical reading circles. Insome cities the authorities have reserved 
a room in the city hall for the teachers’ libraries, which serves also for meetings 
of the ‘‘library society” or ‘‘reading circle.” In Luneville a circle was organ- 
ized in 1881 by the teachers then assembled in annual convention. The name 
adopted was ‘‘ Pedagogical and Literary Circle of Luneville.” Ithad the nucleus 
of a library, and now added a school museum. The annual dues were fixed at 2 
franes. The teachers serve voluntarily as librarians -and custodians. One of 
them is always found at specially designated days and hours in the hall of the 
circle. The city council defrays the expenses for furnishing, heating, and light- 
ing the hall, and, besides, contributes to the institution a sum of money for the 
express purpose of subscribing for the six best educational journals of France. 
All substitute teachers and such as are not definitely employed ave exempted_ 
from paying fees, but must, when needed, render aid to the librarian and custo- 
dian. The library consisted in 1889 of 1,308 volumes; the number of books bor- 
rowed and taken home was 245. The museum had 875 articles. The first Satur- 
day evening of every month is devoted to lectures on pedagogical subjects which 
~ are in close connection with the practical work in school. For young men pre- 
paring for the teachers’ examination speciai aid is offered in lessons and lectures. 
The first list of pedagogical libraries of France was published in 1879. In that 
year France had 926 such libraries, with 113,997 volumes. In 1880 the number 
was 2,068, with 361,898 volumes, and in 1888 the number had reached 2,683, with 
895,367 volumes. The reports of the minister of education, however, reveal a 
surprising fact, namely, that the number of books borrowed is comparatively 
very small; in some provinces it sank to5in ayear. In most of the others it 
varied between 20 and 40 per year, and only a few of these libraries are frequently 
used. The general impression gained from the official reports is that the present 
condition of the pedagogical libraries is not asatisfactory one; progress is shown 
only in isolated places. The causes may b2 found in circumstances of material 
nature, partly in the quite remarkable indifference on the part of the teachers. 
Lately several attempts at improving the conditions of these libraries have 
been made ; reforms were proposed from different sides. Thus, for instance, it

has been suggested to centralize the ¢many cantonal (or district) libraries and 
establish departmental (or provincial) ones; others proposed a partial change 
by combining all small libraries of one school inspectorate to one good-sized one. 
Still another project was promulgated in 1874. A benevolent-gentleman offered 
to give 30,000 franes in case the libraries were established according to the fol- 
lowing plan: Each inspectorate: should establish a central library containing all 
the more valuable books and books of reference, while the small local district 
libraries be kept intact. In these small libraries should be examined all the 
educational works published, and the approved ones be placed in the central 
library. But this plan found no approval, and the Government began to take 
other measures which found much praise in Europe, 7. ¢., it laid the foundation 
ring and presenting books to individual teachers. 
A circular letter of the minister of education of April 3, 1882, reads as fol- 
lows: ‘*In order that the teachers’ normal schools should exercise an abiding 
influence upon the teachers, I am willing to present every graduate of a nor- 
mal school who enters this year upon the profession a number of books selected 
from among those which appeared to him indispensable during his time of study. 
This small collection of books which he takes with him shall awaken and pre- 
serve in him a love for his profession; shall console and constantly aid him, even 
though fate may send him to the remotest corner of the country. If the young 
man adds to these books others, such as he can borrow from the pedagogical 
library of his schcol district and canton, as well as by mail from the ‘Musée 
pedagogique’ in Paris, he will never feel lonely, forsaken, and condemned to 
inactivity. He will be enabled to continue his studies and increase his knowledge. 
In order that this object may be secured without delay I empower the faculties 
  .of the normal schools to provide each graduate with a number of educational 
books that each may select himself, but the sum total of which must not exceed 
70 francs for one teacher.” It is to be regretted that subsequent legislative bod- 
ies did not provide for the requisite appropriation to carry out this plan, but the 
teachers in France hope that another year will see the plan of the minister re- 
vived and adopted by the Chamber of Deputies. 
It is generally acknowledged as the best policy to leave the cantonal libraries 
intact, but toimprove their management (1) by allowing the teachers the selec- 
tion of books to be purchased, (2) by giving these libraries the franking privi- 
lege (through the mail), (3) by paying the librarians a salary, and (4) by inter- 
esting all the teachers through making them pay a compulsory annual fee. 
This last proposition has, however, found violent opposition, since its execution 
would violate the letter and spirit of the law which created these libraries. It- 
is said that a reduction of the membership fee from 2 francs to 1 france would be 
a wiser step. 
The severest criticism these libraries have found is to the effect that they are 
exclusively pedagogical, 7. ¢., contain nothing except professional works, while 
“the truest pedagogical library is any well-stocked library,” says one depart- 
mental report, which suggests the acquisition of other than purely professional 
hooks. This consideration seems to have prevailed, for the catalogue published 
in 1888 contains a number of titles of books of fiction and others. It is supposed 
that teachers who have performed a hard day’s work in the schoolroom are not 
inclined to subject themselves to difficult scientific study. And in connection 
with this the normal schools are severely criticised for failing to awaken a love’ 
for reading in their pupils. ‘The study of literature suffersfrom the exclusive 
attention paid to professional studies in these schools.” Some inspectors have 
succeeded in gaining a kind of control oyer the reading of their teachers by re- 
quiring a report of the names of books they have read, a statement as to their 
contents, and some criticisms, which are discussed in their regular monthly 
conferences. 
In general the statistical data given show that the pedagogical libraries in 
France have made progress during the last ten years, and the interest exhibited 
by local authorities in their establishment and preservation is an encourag- 
ing sign. The authorities hope that the present indifference of teachers and 
school officials will slowly give way to greater professional activity. To this 
end the central departmental and cantonal authorities are joining hands. (After

. 12.—MANUAL TRAINING. 
. Germany.—Manual training at Leipsic. So much attention has been drawn to 
the Lloyd Seminary at Naiis that the similar institution which is carried on in 
theold Thomas School at Leipsic, under the direction of Dr. W. Gotze, hardly 
  gets the attention which it deserves. But to those who wish to pursue their ’

    1210 - © EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90.” ; 
‘ 
manual training studies, to those who «an readily follow the lectures on the 
subject given once a week at the university at Leipsic, and to those again who, 
besides studying manual training, wish to perfect themselves in German and 
to see German life a little more from the inside than is possible in ordinary 
traveling—to all such we venture to think the Leipsic imstitution will prove 
more and more attractive every year. To a doctrinaire of the Niis school 
Leipsic yields an admirable corrective. A list of subjects of the lectures given 
last August will suggest the bill of fare provided for those who have a good 
knowledge of German. ‘ Herbart’s Relation to the Manual Training Move- 
ment,” ‘The History of Chip-Carving,” and ‘' Voices from the Middle Ages and 
from the Eighteenth Century in Aid of Our Contention,” were among the sub- 
jects treat dof la: August. But even more stimulating were the “addresses 
given by Herr von Schenckdorft and Dr. Gotze on their return from the Stras? 
burg conference at the end of the month. Those whoare less proficient in Ger- 
man may acquaint themselves with the history and objects of manual training 
in Germany by borrowing from the library of the institute some interesting 
documents by Dr. Gotze ‘which have been translated into English, and they 
may in the mean time increase their knowledge of German by assidudus atiend- 
ance at the excellent city thea‘er, at w ich the cost of students’ seats, num- 
bered and reserved, is not more than 7id. a night. Prominence is given to 
these particulars respe the theoretical side of manual instruction, because 
it is the part which is most frequently neglected, especially in England, and be- 
cause, too, contrary to the common opinion, it is hopeless to expect any useful 
results from manual training unless ers attend as carefully to theory as 
they do to practice. With regard to the five subjects in which practical instruc- 
“tion is given at Leipsic—e spentry. light metal work, chip-carving, cardboard, 
and (for the first time this year) gar dening—tfull particulars will be found in the 
prospectus. Any additional information “will be ri eadily given by Dr. Gotze, 
whose address is 19 Kaiser Wilhelm strasse. (Lond. Ed. 'Times). 
The German Society for Manual Training has made extensive statistical in- 
quiries concerning the present status and extent of manual training in Germany. 
The results of these inquiries are published by Mr. Sontag in pamphlet form. 
We cull the following items: 
The greatest number of manual tr ‘aining schools in Germany are found in the 
Kingdom of Saxony, namely, 42; then follows the province of Silesia with 17; 
then the Thiiringian principalities with 16, the Free Cities with 13, the province 
of Saxony with 10, the provinces of Hanover and Brandenburg with 9 each, 
Alsace-Lorraine with 7,and Bavaria with 6. Besides, there are over 50 of such 
schools in other parts of Germany; Rhenish Pr a “has 5 5. The sum total is 
186, situated in 120 cities and towns. The following parts of Germany have no 
manual training schools at all: Anhalt, Brunswick, Mecklenburg, Lippe, Hessia, 
Oldenburg, and Waldeck ; neither the provincesof Pommerania and Westphalia. 
From this it is seen that most manual training schools are found in and around 
industrial centers. Schools for boys’ hand work have been established in moun- 
tainous regions, where they are designed to aid the people to overcome the 
miserable industrial conditions under which they are suffering. Inagricultural 
regions, on the contrary, the need of establishing such schools has not been felt. 
Of the 186 manual training shops enumerated only a few in Silesia and Sax 
ony have industrial purposes. Themajority serve educational purposes. Sixty: 
seven of these, in 62 cities, were independent; 107 of them stood in some relation 
with the public or private institutions. Thus, for instance, 12 normal schools 
have introduced manual training (6 alone in Saxony). ‘All these normal schools 
work according to their own plans, and harmony between the different schools 
in course of study and action is not found. Fifteen orphan asylums have intro- 
duced manual training, 12 private and public schools train in the use of tools, 
also 55 Knabenhorta asylums for boys after school hours, It isremarkable that 
of the institutions for abnormal pupils 24have adopted manual training, namely, 
10 reform schools, 2 schools for idiots, 5 blind asylums, and 7 asylums for deaf- 
mutes. That for the pupils of such institutions training in hand work is an es- 
sential requirement of success is seen from all the reports received from these 
institutions. 
The establishment of manual training shops began about 1879. At this time” 
manual training received a notable impetus in Germany by the vigorous action 
of Capt. Clauson yon Kaas, who, in 1880, in Emden, and later in Dresden, trained 
anumber of teachers in this new branch of study. Since that time several fac- 
tors have been active as founders of manual training schools. Societies and 
private persons in some places, in others communal and state officials, are inter-

ested in promoting manual training. While in the year 1854 the number of 
shops was about 50, in 1888 the number had nearly quadrupled; in like manner 
the number of pupils increased from 2,080 in 1884 to5,678 in 1888. The majority | 
of these pupils, namely, 67 per cent, were less than 14 years of age, while 24 per — 
cent were pupils of intermediate, high, and normal schools. : 
Concerning the subjects taught in these shops the report says that pasteboard 
work, wood-carving, and joiner work are everywhere taught first.’ These seem 
to be the chief occupations. In 1888 77 manual training shops had taken up 
pasteboard work, 61 weod-carving, 60 joiner work. Of the pupils 43 per cent 
were occupied with pasteboard work, 32 per cent with wood-carving, 31 per — 
cent with joiner work. Seven of these schools teach forging, molding, and 
other light metal work ; in three of them modeling is taught. Here and there 
* are found painting on wood, scroll-saw work in wood and metal, turning, cane- 
braiding, brash and broom making, basket-braiding, straw-mat braiding, fillet- 
netting as branches of the course. These latter branches are offered only in 
places where the school is intended to aid the home industry. 
It is pleasing to notice that most of the schools follow courses which are 
founded upon pedagogical principles; the models are made by teachers them- 
selves or copied from the well-known Leipsic models.      
Instruction in these manual training schools is given by 208 professional — 
  teachers and 48 artisa The question whether artisans or teachers should be 
employed in manual training schools has been successfully solved by experience. 
Since 1889 the ratios of artisans and teachers in manual training schools have 
been :

The number of professional teachers instructing in the workshops has gradu- 
ally increased to 81 per cent, while the number of teaching artisans has de- 
creased accordingly. In training shops maintained solely for educational pur- 
poses professional teachers only are employed. Several reports state that in 
schools where artisans are still employed teachers are greatly to be preferred. 
In schoo's, however, that ave intended for industrial purposes it is found that 
skilled artisans are preferable, becauss they have an eye towards practical util- 
ity such as professional teachers are not likely to have. Special courses for 
teachers in the Normal College of the German Society for Manual Training have 
been very successful in supplying schools with teachers preparing to teach man- 
ual work. Since the year 1880 about 1,000 persons have gone through a course 
of study in that school, which is situated in Leipsic. 
     
    
The German teachers have been repeatedly charged with indifference toward — 
the cause of manual training. This charge is only too true, but in a measure 
this indifference has its cause in stolid opposition to manual training. Manual 
training claims the assistance of the teachers, and very essentially changes and 
modifies the time-honored limits of a teacher’s activity. Manual! training has 
nothing to fear from oppcsition; on the contfary such opposition as it finds 
among the teachers proves to be a benefit. This is partly proved by the statis- 
tical data before mentioned. Any one who introduces manual training into his «_ 
school is obliged to sacrifice time, and cnergy,and eyen means. Yet, wherever 
it has been introduced the initiatory steps were taken by schoolmen. Nine of | 
the twelve independent workshops have keen established by educators. 
As far as the time of instruction is concerned most manua!-training schools 
admit twice a year, in the spring and fall. The school is better attended dur- 
ing the winter than the summer semester. In Berlin, Posen, and Halle, vaca- 
tion courses are offered. Generally 2 hours per day are devolved to hand work 
in the shops: in a few places I to 14 hours; in others 24 or 3 hours per day are 
set aside for it. The number of pupils in a class for pasteboard work is from 12 
to 20; for wood carving, 10-24; injoiner workfrom12-16. Tuition feeischarged 
in almost all sehools. Very few offer gratuitous instruction. In some places 
the feo has to be paid in advance, in others a monthly fee is charged. Tho fee 
    varies between half a mark and 10 marks por month (123 cents to $2.50). The — 
The average fee is between 1 and 2 marks (25 and £0 cents). 
    
  
         
-P-A-G-E-620
          1212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
A number of manual-training teachers teach without special salary; others 
are satisfied with the small sum remaining after material, rent, and gas are paid 
for. Fixed salaries to teachers are paid here and there, and 1 to 2 marks per 
hour is about the usual- price paid. The annual salaries range from 75 marks 
($19) to 105 marks ($26). 
‘The sums expended for the establishment and maintenance of manual-training 
shops are not very large if measured with an American standard. During the 
year 1888 the sum total raised and used for this purpose is estimated to have 
amounted to 50,000 marks, or $12,500. This insignificant sum was raised by 
school authorities, societies, private persons, subscriptions, tuition fees, and be- 
quests. Pitiably small as the sum may seem to us, we must bear in mind thata 
mark goes as far in Germany as a dollar does in America; but even that would 
not come up to the sums spent in this country. Manual training has assumed 
enormous proportions in the United States, where entire city-school systems 
haye adopted it. (After Paedagogium.) 
13.—MEDICAL SUPERVISION. 
Medical supervision of the schools in Paris.—The present institution of medical 
supervision of the schools in Paris does not date further back than 1884, although 
previous to that year the schools were not entirely without supervision by phy- 
sicians, The law of 1833 (June 28) had charged the school committees of the 
respective towns and cities with the care of keeping the schoolhouses clean, 
while a royal orainance of 1837 (December 22) made it a special duty of the 
female supervisors of maternal schools (kindergartens) to watch over the health 
of the little children in the infant asylums. 
For the city of Paris separate governmental decrees had been issued, while 
the two decrees mentioned had reference to all the schools of France. The de- 
erees of 1842 (December 20) and 1843 (May 19) ordered that every public boys’ 
and girls’ school should be visited by a physician who was to inspect the locali- 
ties and the general health of the schcol children. For private schools'and 
maternal schools similar regulations were issued. These school physicians of 
public institutions and the lady inspectors of maternal schools were appointed 
“by the ‘‘prefect” of the department selected from nominations made by the 
mayor. * 
However praiseworthy this arrangement was, it had a great drawback. In 
the annual budgets of the communities no provision was made for paying these 
physicians, hence an appeal to the generosity of the medical fraternity was nec- 
essary. Many offered their services and acted gratuitously for many years. 
In January, 1878, Messrs. Lauth and Harant, members of the general council 
of the Seine department, moved a reorganization of the medical service in school. 
Their endeavors were not without speedy success, for during the session of April 
23, 1879, the council voted in favor of paying for medical supervision of the 
schools during the last six months of that year. The sum appropriated was 
34,200 francs. New regulations issued by the prefect determined certain mooted 
questions and defined the duties of the physicians. The Seine department was 
divided into 114 medical districts, of which 85 were within the city of Paris. 
Each district contained between 20 and 25 schoolrooms. 
The medical inspectors, who had to be graduates of well reputed schools of 
medicine, were nominated by the mayors of the different arrondissements (wards), 
and appointed by the prefect of the department. 
Their term of office was three years, at an annual salary of 600 frances. They 
were obliged to visit the schools of their district at least twice a month, care- 
fully inspect the localities, and remove any children found to be suffering from 
contagious or infectious disease. They even were empowered to order a school 
closed in time of epidemics. 
During the absence of the physician, the principals of the schools had to watch 
over the health of the pupilsin their respective buildings. In order to assist 
them in this, the authorities provided them with instructions issued by the 
supreme sanitary council of Paris, according to which they could detect the 
symptons of contagious and infectious diseases. In Paris the medical servicein 
school stood under the immediate supervision of the mayor of the ‘‘arrondisse- 
ment,” while in the surburbs and the country the head of the ‘‘ canton” watched 
over the faithful discharge of duty on the part of the physician. 
Up to the year 1882 the entire expense for the new institution was defrayed 
by the ‘‘ Department,” but in that year the communal budget of Paris con- 
tained the item of 53,000 franes for salaries of school physicians.
-P-A-G-E-621
    FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 1213 
The expenses made during the first period of three years of service had taught 
the authorities valuable lessons, which led to the following reforms: It was 
found that the number of schoolrooms (20 to 25), given to one physician to 
supervise, was too large; the consequence was that the examination of indi- 
vidual children with reference to their eyesight, ears and teeth (the seats of 
most children’s diseases), could not be minute and exact enough, hence the city 
council appointed a commission which worked out and submitted a new statute, 
or set of regulations; this was adopted on Noyember 7, 1883, and went into eo 
January 1, “1884. 
The most important points of these regulations, which are still in force, are 
as follows: 
ART. 2. The public schools of the city-of Paris are for the purpose of medical 
supervision to be divided into groups of from 15 to 20 schoolrooms. Any ma- 
ternal school is to be reckoned as two rooms. A redistricting takes place every 
three years. The prefect performs this duty. Newly opened schools are as-_ 
signed to the nearest ‘‘ medical group.” 
ART. e The salary of a school physician is 800 francs per annum ($160). 
Art. 4, The physicians are nominated by the mayors and appointed by the 
prefect of the department. 
Art. 5. The tenure of office of these physicians is for three years. 
Art. 8. Every school physician must announce to the mayor his address of 
residence or office, and the hours at which he can be found there. This state- 
ment is published at a conspicuous place in the respective schools. 
ART. 9. A book must be kept in every public school and maternal school, in 
which the school physician notes down his observations. This book must be 
submitted to the inspection of officials and supervisory authorities. 
ArT. 10. The school physician is obliged to visit every public and maternal 
school twice a month, but he must also appear there when the mayor or prefect 
may see fit to order a visit. 
Art. 11. When visiting a schoolhouse the physician shall first thoroughly 
inspect the ‘‘localities” (corridors, stairs, waterclosets, etc.). In doing so the 
principal of the school is to accompany him, so that he may receive suggestions 
from the physician. Then the latter visits each class-room, and after he has 
inspected them with reference to light, heat, ventilation, and furniture, ete., 
he must proceed to examine the pu ipils separately, especially those who are 
pointed out by the principal and teachers as showing symptoms of indisposition. 
After the examination of a schoolroom and its inmates is completed, the physi- 
cian enters the results into his book intended for this purpose. He answers the 
different questions and tabulates his answers in the columns provided for them. 
In the column ‘‘ad hoc” he enters the names of those children in whom he has 
noticed symptoms of approaching disease, states that their withdrawal from 
school proves necessary, and especially notes whether the disease is contagious. 
Finally he enters the number of pupils absent on account of sickness on the day 
of his visit, and inquires of the teachers what sickness, if any, seem to be préva- 
lent at that time. 
ART. 13. At least once a month a thorough examination of each child is to be 
made with reference to eyes, ears, and teeth, if the physician finds an inclina- 
tion to disease, or if the general state of health of a child needs special attention 
on the part of the parents these must be notified by the physician’s certificate, 
which is to be handed to the child. 
ART. 14. Children in whom the physician discovers the symptoms of a conta- 
gious or infectious disease are to be sent home at once with a sealed letter, in 
which the physician states the cause of this step. In this letter the parents are 
notifi d that the child is not permitted to attend school until it comes with a 
certificate signed by a school physician announcing its complete recovery. 
Art. 15. The principal cf every school keeps at hand a series of instructions 
issued by the supreme sanitary council, in which the symptoms of contagious 
and infectious diseases are stated. If a ‘child gets ill during the absence of the 
school physician, the teacher of the respective class room notifies the principal. - 
If the latter finds symptoms of a contagious or infectious disease, he must send 
the child home with a sealed letter, in | which he asks the parent or guardian to 
call at the office of the respective school physician during his office hours, which 
ave mentioned. 
ArRv. 16. A certificate of recovery may even be required of children who have 
been absent for any length of time on account of sickness, without having been

is subjected to a special examination by the school physician, and thus acquires 
a certificate of recovery.

& This supervision of the Paris elementary schools was, in 1839, perfermed by 
128 physicians. The budget of the city for that year contained the sum of 100,300 
franes for this institution. Medical supervision of schools in Paris has served 
asa model for similar arrangements in other French cities. By means of a min- 
isterial order of November 14, 1879, the attention ofall prefects was called to the 
instructions quoted above at length. But since then, through the school law of 
October, 30, 1886, as well as through ministerial decrees and orders dated Nov- 
ember 18, 1887, medical and sanitary inspection has been made obligatory forall 
_the schools, public and private. 
A few years ago, the city council of Paris expressed the desire that with this 
_ institution of revision be connected a free school dispensary. This sugges- 
tion is under advisement at present. These dispensaries, so it isintended, shall 
2 ~ go further than the school physicians who are watching over the health of the 
children. These dispensaries shall take sick children and treat them in hospital 
wards, specially arranged for children, and provide them with medicine and sur- 
gical tance 
As early as 1862, a few free dispensaries were in existence in Paris supported 
by charitable societies, notably the ‘Société philanthropique.” These dispen- 
eas saries were connected with the hospitals for children, but there is a differenc> 
x between institutions founded and maintained by charity and those bylaw. In 
‘these private dispensaries children could not always have the desirable special 
treatment, medicine, shower baths, ete. To the city of Havre belongs the honor 
and cre dit of having founded the first public free dispensary for children. This 
institution is equipped with allthe most desirable conveniences and all necessary 
4 appliances. In18/5.a physician, Dr. Giebert, aided by contributions of charita- 
_ ple persons, established an institution of this kind which had astonishing re- 
sults, and was subsequently made a city institution. 
In Paris he first children’s dispensary was opened in the first arrondissement 
upon urgent sol ion of Dr. Dubrisay and M. Baudof. It found a home in 
Jean Lantier street, No. 15, in a house which was offered by the owners free of 
charge. Since the date of opening, April 1, 1833, the consultations in this in- 
\ stitution have reached the enormous number of 60, 000; in the first year the num- 
ber was 5,087, then steadily increasing, it reached. 193) 000 in 1889. ‘The expenses 
- during 1889 were 5,980 franes, but the annual donations amounted to 8,205 frances. 
2 The example set by the first arrondissement soon. found imitators. To- -day 
: (in 1890) eight arrondissements have children’s dispensaries partly supported 
by private persons (like those in the thirteenth and fourteenth arrondissements), 
pany by the city. The excellent influence these few institutions have exerted 
as awakened the desire of increasing their number and to provide every ward 
, of the city with one; hence a credit “of 100,000 francs was opened for that pur- 
pose in the city budget of 1890, and all indications point toward an early fulfil- 
ment of the desire mentioned above, namely, that the medical and sanitary in- 
spectionofthe schools be supplemented by a great number of free dispensaries in 
: which children will find the treatment needed in cases of sickness. (After L.

teaching, when the pupils are dismissed, the teachers and inspector hold a con- 
sultation to talk over any points of interest they have observed, with a view to 
improving the methods of teaching. Some of the benefits of these. conven- 
tiocnsare obvious. The teachers observe the pointsof excellenceand the defects 
in the room they visit, and all are benefited by the experience and exchange of 
ideas. Besides, they bring about uniformity in teaching and management, 
which is an essential feature in graded schools, where pupils pass frem one.

Belgium.—The State Savings Bank, of Belgium, in its report of 1890 contains 
a few interesting points concerning the mooted question of savings banks. Bel- 
gium had in 1890, altogether, 7,637 elementary schools attended by 896,787 pu- 
pils (449,497 boys and 447,290 girls). In 4,965 schoo!s the custom of collecting 
savings has been fostered. The pupils own 167,696 savings books (92,975 boys   
and 74,721 girls). Besides these there are 38,907 pupils whose savings are so _ 
small that they have not acquired their own bank book. The amount saved by 
the children in 1890 was $808,430 (of which the boys contributed $443,344, the 
girls $365,086), an increase of $24,296 over the previous year. The province of 
Hennegan has the greatest number of juvenile savers, while Limberg has the 
smallest. The teachers are generally opposed to the institution of school. say- 
ings banks, and expressed this in unmistakable terms at their last annual meet- 
ing. At the general meeting of the clementary teachers in Brussels, the school 
savings bank has been condemned by a vote of 117 yeas and 86 nays, on the fol- 
lowing grounds: (1) What is saved is never sufficient to provide aid in ease of 
Sickness or accidents. Insurance companies and workmen’s unions Would be 
much better. (2) Saving makes young children selfish; the teaching at school 
ought to develop char 
that save—it is the parents, who give their savings to the children to take them 
to the schoolmaster, who thus becomes the banker for the parents. (4) Several 
parents save from a desire to please the schoolmaster. (5) The practical good 
of the school savings bank, after a trial of twenty-five years, may be said to be 
nil. (Different educ. journals.) 
     
    
   - Austvia.—The annual report concerning the schcol kitchens in Vienna during — 
the winter of 1889-’90 shows that indigent pupils were provided with a good 
  dinner (soup, vegetables, and bread). The number thus provided for was 2,869 
a day; but the real number is much greater. Many pupils come with their lit- 
tle brothers and sisters, and the cook is told to help the older children, who 
thus ‘‘ provide for the family ” more plentifully. Often children come to school 
who are not enrolled and ask for a dinner which is never refused. In one hun- 
dred and thirty-two days 381,577 dinners have been served, but if the foregoing 
is considered the number is more than 400,000. Lately these kitchens can not 
supply all the children who come; poverty and starvation are spreading in 
Vienna. (Oestr. Schulbote.) 
Lgypt.—In the government schocls of Egypt it has been the rule for years 
that, in addition to Arabic, every pupil must learn English or French at his op- 
tion. This is not merely as a linguistic study, but is gradually being made the 
medium of instruction in the ordinary curriculum and in science. In 1889 only 
14 per cent of the pupils chose English in preference to French, but last year the’ 
proportion rose to 23 yer cent. In order to meet the increased desire to learn 
English, a normal school for native teachers has been opened, and it has 30 
students. Also 6 young Egyptians have been sent to normal colleges in Eng- 
land te qualify themselves as teachers in the government schools. On the other’ 
hand, about 100 pupilsare studying in France atthe expense of, or recommended 
by, the Egyptian Gevernment, and a Government normal school exists in Cairo 
under French management. Hence, it would appear that the French have 
the inside track in Egypt. (Lond. Jl. of Ed.) 
England.—The money-lender and the betting man are never greater curses of 
their race than when their wiles entrap school boys who have expectations of 
coming into the possession of property when they are of age. The English leg~ 
islators have, to some extent, restrained the evils in other places, but the cir- 
cuiars of the betting agent and money-lender seem to have found the way without 
hinderance into both public and private schceols. Recently Lord Herschell 
brought the matter before the House of Lords; and archbishops and bishops, 
the lord chancellor and lords justice, dukes, earls, and other lords were abso- 
lutely unanimous in supporting the meastire for rendering it penal to send out ~ 4215

such circulars to boys at school and youths at college. Lord Herschell in intro- 
ducing the bill said its object was to render penal the sending of what were 
known as touting, betting circulars to boys at school and youths at college; and 
it proceeded upon the assumption, in this case quite justifiable, that the receivers 
at schools and colleges were prima facie persons who were infantsand known to 
be such, leaving it to the sender to show that in any particular case the person’ 
to whom a circular was sent was not an infant. He added that if he received 
encouragement he should be prepared to extend the scope of the bill by includ- 
ing the sending of money-lending circulars. (Schoolm.) 
iii tha school board of Berlin has ordered the purchase of an ample 
number of cuspidors for use in the schools. The committee on science and 
medicine had recommended this on the ground that tuberculosis (consumption) 
is transmitted through germs in the air, hence that the expectorations of sick 
children are apt to cause contagion if not confined to spittoons filled with water. 
The vessels are placed in every class room, on stair landings and corridors, and 
are attended to twice aday. (Allg. Dr Lztg.)

The minister of education has senta notice to the provincial councils, request- 
ing them not to refer candidates for positions as school superintendents to him, 
but themselves to take the initiative in recommending suitable persons to him. 
“Tt is of extreme importance,” he writes, ‘‘for the proper development of edu- 
cation in elementary schools, that the responsible office of school superintend- 
ent should be only in the hands of especially trustworthy men, those who have 
proved themselves to be efficientelementary schoolmasters. ‘This applies equally 
to masters who have enjoyed auniversity education. I expect that the local au- 
thorities will not restrict themselves toan examination of those candidates who 
. present themselves for election, but will, without regard to expected vacancies, 
keep themselves conscientiously informed of specially suitable candidates. The 
school inspections, and an understanding with the provincial school board, will 
ofier ample opportunity to discover such persons.” (Lond. Jl. of Ed.) 
How to treat stulterers.— Dr. Schellenberg, in Wiesbaden, gives the following 
advice to teachers as to how to treat stutterers : 
(1) Treat the stutterer most kindly, and try to-win his entire confidence. (2) 
Prevent other children from making fun of his trouble, and if necessary punish 
themforit. (3) Infuse him with courage and self-reliance. (4) During the first 
few weeks of school ask him no questionsin recitation ; then begin with such easy 
questions that he can answer without reflection and hesitation.. (5) Direct your 
attention away from the stutterer assoon as he betrays confusion and disquie- 
tude in his attempt at speaking; repeat your question when he has regained   
 
-P-A-G-E-625
    ‘ ’ : RPE? > 
" FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 1217 
composure. (6) Urge him to assume a straight posture when speaking. (7) See 
to it that while speaking he breathes through the mouth, not through the nose, 
and that he takes adeep breath when he comes to a period or other convenient 
full stop. He should also take breath before he attempts to answer a question. 
(8) Advise him to begin his speech slowly and in a lower pitch than usual. (9) 
If the first word of his sentence begins with a vowel, let him begin that vowel 
faintly and increase it in strength thus, A—sia. If the word begins with acon- 
sonant, lethim blur over it to reach the vowel, dwell on that, and then go on 
thus, ba—thing. (10) The stutterer must learn to run. his words into one an- 
other so that no hiatus occurs, which would, of course, facilitate or cause stut- 
‘tering. He should at first speak thus: ‘‘A—Il’swellthatendswell,” until he has 
to some extent mastered his infirmity. 
These points are exceptionally well taken, and the present writer can confirm 
them, since he has found them of excellent use in the school room. The Eng- 
lish language does not breed so many stutterers as the German, but there are 
still cases enough in our schools to make advice like the foregoing welcome to 
teachers of little experience, and of them, alas! we have more than is desirable. 
(Allg. D. Latg.) 3 
Saxony.—In the Kingdom of Saxony the lower schools have on an average 73 
pupils to the teacher. The greatest number is found in inspection—District 
Loebau, namely, 95; then Chemnitz, with nearly 94; then Schwarzenberg, 92, 
“and Marienberg, 91. The smallest number is found in Leipzig, where it is 43; 
in Dresden itis44; other districts have respectively 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74 pupils 
to the teacher. There are still 128 schools of three grades with but one teacher, 
and averaging 132 pupils. In 1,117 continuation schools (post-graduate courses 
of elementary schools) instruction is given all the year round; in 712 only dur- 
ing the winter. (Allg. D. Lztg.) 
Germany.—The Society for the Promotion of Public Games for the young and 
for the people in Germany, which was founded in May in Berlin, has already 
begun to make itself felt. Committees have been formed under,the direction of 
Dr. Hitner, of Gérlitz, and Dr. Schmidt, of Bonn. The latter, who is also a 
member of the Committee of the German Gymnastic Society, announces that the 
latter society is ready to join in active codperation for the promotion of health- 
giving games for the people. The minister of education, Graf Zedlitz, has ex- 
pressed his heartiest sympathy in the aims of the society. In June, 1891, a 
course of instruction in public-school games was held in Girlitz for the benefit 
of the teachers. Dr. Eitner and Herr Jordan, the head teacher of gymnastics, 
conducted the classes, which were numerously attended. 
Gorlitz, a very progressive town in the province of Silesia, which was one of 
the first cities in Germany which introduced manual training, again comes to 
the front with normal courses for teachers in public games. Public play, sup- 
plementary to gymnastic exercises, has recently become an object’ of much at- 
tention of the Government as well as educational circles. (German Ed. Press.) 
France.—Levasseur, the noted French statistician, makes the following state- 
ments concerning the population in France: France (or Gaul) had at the time 
of Cesar 6,700,000 inhabitants, estimated according to the size and number of 
Gallic tribes. Roman Gaul during the time of the Antonines is said to have ~ 
had 8,500,000, but this is a mere hypothesis. At the time of Charlemagne Gaul 
is said to have had only 5,500,000 inhabitants, according to Irmions Polyptique, 
but 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 according to an estimate made at the time. During 
the first half of the fourteenth century Gaul had 20,000,000 or 22,000,000, es- 
timated by means of the number of hearths. At the end of the sixteenth 
century Froumenteau credited Gaul with 20,000,000 inhabitants. In 1700 the 
number is said to have been 21,136,000, estimated in the ‘‘ Memoirsof an admin- 
istrative officer.” In 1715 the estimate was 18,000,000. Numerous positive state- 
ments go to show that in 1770 the number of inhabitants was 24,500,000, and in 
the great memorable year of the revolution, 1789, it was stated to be 26,000,000. 
In 1801 a rectified census proved the inhabitants of France to be 27,347,800; in 
1866, 38,067,064 (with Alsace-Lorraine) ; in 1872, 36,102,921 (without Alsace-Lor- 
raine), and in 1886, 37,930,759. 
Germany.—Recently statistics have been published concerning suicides of chil- 
dren in Prussia. The Neue Freie Presseof Vienna on May 26 published a state- 
ment which permits a comparison between Prussia and Italy. Since in popila- 
tion the two countries are nearly alike, a comparison seems just. The cases 
mentioned are all committed by children below 15 years of age.

a ; 15.—MUSEUMS IN SCHOOL.   
France.—In the year 1888, at the general teachers’ meeting in Frankfurt-am- * 
Main, a speaker claimed that every school should have its own local museum, 
in which should be kept not only the tools of all the trades and industries, but 
also the raw material necessary for those trades, as well as the finished products 
in their development from the smallest and simplest beginnings to their com- 
pletion. This demand, made in all earnest, has been recognized as just in 
France for some years, at least partly. The school museums in that country 
(called local museums) form an indispensable means for object lessons. Their 
_ establishment was an unavoidable consequence of universal application of ob- 
jective teaching, which had been advocated by such men as Montaigne, Rabelais, 
- Fenelon, and Rousseau and others, especially after the great revival of popular 
elementary instruction (since 1871). Men of science and educationai leaders 
were eloquent in advocating the teaching of visible things and processes in 
preference to empty words. 
_ The French school museums contain natural and art productions-which are 
suitable for offering clear concepts of things surrounding the child. All these 
_ objects are systematically and methodically arranged, and adapted to each grade 
of school. It is most instructive to learn the history of these museums. Their 
- beginning dates back to the year 1867. At the ‘‘ World’s Exposition” in Paris 
a few collections of objects were exhibited and Madame Pape-Carpentier gave 
_ lectures in which she dwelt on the good use to which these collections might be 
putin schools. Thissuggestion fell upon fertile soil, and when in 1873 M. Buisson 
_reported upon the Vienna Exposition he could already state, that France was 
not behind other countries in matters of school museums,and that some prov- 
_ inces (departments) possessed more than a hundred of them filled with agricul- 
tural and industrial objects. Their number has increased rapidly. It is note- 
_ worthy that most of them had their origin in the initiative of the teachers who 
began, aided by their pupils, to collect models and natural objects, and arrange 
them systematically. In 1890 France had over 14,000 school museums, which 
such as may be found in almost any school where natural history is the hobby 
of the teacher. 
Legal provisions for the establishment of school museums are notin existence 
in France. It was not a question of introducing anew branch of study or a new 
method of teaching, but simply a question of procuring the means for teaching © 
‘the instructions and exhibited a lively interest in them. A new impetus was 
given the idea of school museums through the report of M. Buisson, mentioned 
above, in which the various collections for school purposes exhibited in Vienna 
- were minutely described. This report did much to awaken interest among local 
_ tendents) reporting on the schools of their districts and provinces were unani- 
mous in acknowledging the usefulness of these collections for elementary school ~ 
instruction. 
Through public lectures to teachers on the subject of objective teaching, M. 
Buisson, in 1878, succeeded in awakening great enthusiasm among teachers. On

FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 
Soon after there was scarcely a province of France (department) in which teach- 
ers did not from the rostrum and through the press agitate the introduction of 
object lessons and school museums. “ 
Most of the museurhs were established by teachers and pupils themselves, : 
who bore the expense ; hence material aid on the part of the state was not nec- 
essary. Some communities defrayed the cost of original establishment, others. 
brought collections offered, by private citizens. All were agreed upon the prin- 
ciple that instruction in things without having the things to show is irra- 
tional, and that both in the kindergarten and primary school the same method 
of object lessons should be followed which a mother applies in order to create 
ideas, namely, by means of objects and not words. The child must be led to 
know the objects within its vicinity distinctly. This is best accomplished by 
means of the intuitive method for whose application the reading lesson offers 
the best. opportunity. During a reading lesson a great variety of objects are’ 
mentioned, and if they can ke given into the children’s hands attention is se- 
cured, the mind is being sharpened, the power of judgment developed ; inshort, 
the child is accustomed to distinct seeing. and clear comprehension. The 
teacher is enabled to abridge verbal explanations where he has objects to show; * 
he can thereby make his lessons more interesting, banish the ghost of indiffer- 
ence from his class room and keep alive the joy in work. After the children 
have left school they are not apt to lose the desire to observe, to reflect, and to 
judge. If the school museum had no other result than this that one alone 
would justify its establishment and maintenance. A school museum offers no 
little advantage also to the study of language; the child learns to express its 
ideas better; its vocabulary is increased more rapidly ; it replies more fluently 
when it sees and handles things, and it certainly remembers technical terms 
more easily than in the utter absence of objects. 
Experience has shown all this in schools where museums are kept, while in 
schools which are without museums the teachers have great difficulty in ac- 
eustoming their pupils to a clear and distinct expression and flow of thought. 
It is generally considered best to have the museums established by the pupils 
themselves under the guidance of their teachers, aided by friends of popular edu- 
cation outside of the school. Care must be taken to proceed methodically, for 
it is not.a question of preparing for exhibition some apparatus or objects of lux- 
ury or ‘‘ curios,” which must not be touched from fearof breaking or injuring 
them. The museum should contain those objects which illustrate the teacher’s 
instruction ; objects should be selected which cest little or nothing and may 
easily be procured by the pupils, The more the pupils participate in gathering 
the objects to be placed in the museum, the.more intense will be the interest in _ 
the lessons, for every one wishes to view the objects his comrade has contributed. 
If these suggestions are followed the museum will be made by the school, for the 
school. It was a wise remark of M. Buisson when he said: ‘‘The great ad- 
vantage of a school museum is, not in having it, but in making it.” 
In order that the objects brought to school be safely placed where they are pro- — 3 
tected from dust and remain visible and easily accessible, a good-sized cupboard 
with glass doors is recommended. In case the school authorities refuse to pro-- 
cure it, an appeal is made to a friend of the school, or to some wealthy parents ~ 
of pupils. Such an appeal is rarely made in vain in France. In most schools a 
cupboard is used large enough to accommodate the juvenile library of the schools, 
as well as the museum of objects. 
At first mistakes were made in getting school museums. Some teachers went 
too far in their zeal by collecting objects which stand in no relation to elemen- 
tary instruction. Others, not intending to be surpassed, bought and procured 
more or less complete collections, instead of letting their pupils bring the ob- 
jects as they were needed. It is evident that the true purpose aimed at was 
missed. Large museums which dazzle the eye of the children are injurious © 
rather than useful in school ; for since the children do not know all the objects 
exhibited they care little for them, and interest turns into indifference. Costly 
museums in which the ‘‘ wonderful objects on exhibition ” bear the label ‘‘ Hands 
off!” are not in their proper place in the elementary school, which is to be a 
workshop for mental work. Neither will ready-made collections suffice; they 
serve for decoration more than for actual study. ” 
However, these mistakes were soon rectified. The teachers now proceed 
methodically, generally classifying the objects according to the natural kingdoms. 
In Havre, one of the most progressive cities in France in educational affairs, 
another classification has been adopted. The school museums in that city are 1219

divided into: (1) Objects of food ; (2) objects of clothing ; (3) objects pertaining 
to the dwelling ; (4) miscellaneous objects. Hach group has a number of divi- 
sions. This classification has recently been adopted by other schools, because it 
seemed more practical and suitable than the other, affording an easier finding’ 
of objects and also an easier cataloguing. 
It goes without saying that the teacher is the chief custodian. He must not 
refuse a single object, in order not to hurt the feelings of his pupils. He must 
urge them all to bring objects for exhibition, so that they are able to say ‘‘our 
museum,” not ‘‘ the museum.” 
A chief characteristic of the school museum is that it is never complete. The 
pupils must know that there is always something missing. When, during geog- 
raphy lesson, for instance, it should be said,‘‘ Such and such a thing is needed tofill 
a vacancy in the museum,” the pupils either individually or collectively procure 
_ it. Thus the museum remains an object of interest. Of course, every object 
found worthy of preservation is to be described, numbered, labeled, and placed 
in its proper compartment. The name of the donor may be attached, and this 
naturally incites further efforts. Many objects are collected during excursions 
which the teacher makes with his school into the country and the mountains, 
through factories, along wharves, and through parks. Thus it becomes possible 
to gather in these school museums all the objects illustrating the natural and 
artificial products of the town or village in which the school is situated. Com- 
merce} various industries, agriculture, forestry, all are represented. 
The law of July 27, 1882, prescribes for the elementary schools, ‘instruction 
in the elements of agriculture, horticulture, physics, and natural history.” 
Though the mere rudiments is all that can be expected, the study of physics 
requires some apparatus. Some normal schools induce their students to get 
practice in making such apparatus themselves in their schoo: workshops and 
then allow them to take these objects with them, if they are appointed to a 
teachership, to use them as a ground stock at their collection of apparatus. In 
the Grenoble Normal School every student is required to make a certain num- 
ber of objects for illustrating the study of physics. The State pays for the 
material about 10 francs (or $2) per student. 
To the legitimate contents of a good school museum belong pictures, charts, 
hotographs, etc., for they aid instruction essentially. Generally, pictorial 
illusirations play an important rdle in French school instruction. Recently 
magic lanterns (solar and calcium light cameras) are used, owing to the active 
work of the ‘Society for Promotion of Object Lessons,” These cameras are 
sold at very reasonable prices. 
If the museums are thus provided with all the necessary and useful objects, 
selected according to pedagogical principles and local circumstances, an agri- 
cultural population will have a differentcollection in its schools from that of an 
industrial population, and a girls’ school is apt to have a different collection 
from a boys’ school. It goes without saying that the institution will be a pro- 
lific source of incentives to study. 
The idea of school museums is not a new one. It was first carried out in 
Germany, but at present France has left Germany far behind in fostering and 
supporting the institutions. Victor Cousin once said: ‘‘The true greatness of 
anation does not consist in not imitating others, but on the contrary, in borrow- 
ing good ideas from them and adapting them to the existing conditions of the 
culture at home.” (After L. Fleischer.) 
16.—NATIONAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Argentine Republic.—When the Argentines freed themselves in 1810 from the 
yoke under which they had bowed for three centuries there was practically no 
“education in the Republic. There certainly wasa somewhat decayed university 
(for Spaniards and Indians) founded in 1622 at Cordoba, but its influence was as 
valtielessas itswork. The early history of the Republic was hardly favorable to 
the establishment of a regular educationalsystem, but the clouds were gradually 
clearing away; and from the promulgation of the constitution of 1853, which 
received its final form in 1860, the progress of public instruction, until the tem- 
porary financial disturbances of a year ago, has been uninterrupted.. There are 
2 universities, Cordoba and Buenos Ayres (1821), 15 secondary schools, 35 nor- 
mal schools, 2,396 primary schools, and 831 private schools. Primary instruc- 
tion is free and obligatory for all children between the agesof 6and14 years of ages. 
Urban districts of between 1,000 and 1,500 inhabitants and rural districts of from 
     
-P-A-G-E-629
  * t 
  300 to 500 have a right to a public school. If the obligations laid upon the com- 
munity by the state are satisfied by existing private schools, or by an individual 
family, there is no compulsion'to attend the public schools. In ‘such cases the 
progress of the children is regularly tested by the state by means of periodical- 
examinations. Iffound unsatisfactory the aid of the law is invoked. 
Besides the usual subjects of instruction in primary schools, it is worth noting 
that the Argentine curriculum involves instruction in morals and mannérs, hy- 
giene, the duties of the citizen, and gymnastics. Girls are taught domestic 
economy and manual work; in the country lessons are given in agriculture. If 
a minimum of 15 parents claim religious instruction for their children the law 
authorizes the engagement of ministers of the different creeds for this purpose, 
the teaching to take place of the school hours. But the claim has never been 
advanced, so it may be said that instruction in the Republic is wholly secular. 
The administration of the schools is in the hands of a national council, guided 
by the minister of public instruction. Hach province has a council with limited 
powers and each district a school council, generally composed of teachers, pro- 
fessors, and local dignitaries, the latter being appointed by the national council. 
Hygienic inspection is undertaken by a body of doctors, under the direction of 
the Government. The teachers are as a rule trained in the normal schools; no 
one is allowed to teach in the public schools without the normal diploma, or if 
a foreigner without satisfying the authorities of the normal school as to his or , 
her abilities, and in addition passing an examination in pedagogy. The teach- 
ers are allowed to retire after twenty years’ service on their full pay at date of 
retirement; with three-quarters of their pay after fifteen years, and with half 
pay after ten years’ service, or after accident or injury suffered in the sérvice of 
the state. There is no corporal punishment. The hours are from 11 in the 
morning to 4 in the afternoon, broken by four periods of from ten to fifteen 
minutes each, The classes are not allowed to be larger thanforty. Womenare 
preferred to men as teachers, and where the schools are mixed there are only 
women employed; the head of the boys’ schools is always a man, but most of the 
teachers are women. In 1888 there were $25 teachers—616 womenand 209 men— | 
employed in the capital alone. So much for primary instruction. 
The oldest of the fifteen ‘‘ national colleges,” or secondary schools, was founded 
more than two hundred years ago; that of La Plata was founded in 1884. The 
secondary schools are under the immediate control of the minister, who appoints 
the principals and arranges the curricula. The principalsonly teach from four to 
eight hours a week, and after ten years’service may retire with half, after fifteen 
with two-thirds, and after twenty-seven with the whole of their pay as pensions. 
The boys on entry must have passed through the highest classes of the primary 
schools, or an equivalent, and on leaving they pass the baccalaurate examination ; 
the whole course professes to be a complete preparation for the university. No 
Greek is taught, Latin is the subject of much dispute, and the whole level of the 
instruction given is very low. State scholarships have been suppressed, but & ~ 
private association has founded eighty. There are 2,626 pupils at the schools, 
927 of whom are at Buenos Ayres. In the capital there is a large foreign ele- 
ment in the facultiesemployed in secondary schools. Theadministration of the 
schools is in the hands of the national council, assisted by three superintend- 
ents. 
The plan upon which the two universities are organized is uniform; there are 
only three faculties—law and social science, medicine, and physical and natural 
sciences. There is, however, a distinct feeling in favor of the establishment of 
a faculty of letters. The age of entry is 18, and the course is one of six years. 
Women are allowed to attend lectures in the faculty of medicine—one, in fact, 
recently took her M. D. with honors. (Lond. Jl. of Ed.) 
Austria.—The latest data concerning the Austrian elementary schools are pub- 
lished by the Austrian statistical bureau. Austria had, in 1890, 3,335,674 pupils 
of school age (6 to 14 years); of these 21,895 could not attend school owing to 
mental or physical incapacity, while 365,593 normally endowed children were 
successfully withheld from being enrolled in school. The enforcement of the . 
compulsory-attendance law made 185,464 judicial actions necessary; of these 
68,590 were sentences imposing imprisonment of a few hours or days, while 116,- 
874 imposed fines. Eighty-eight per cent of all lower schoolsin Austria proper, 
that is, the western half of Austria-Hungary, are for both sexes; 6.8 per cent 
were for boys only ; 5.2 per cent for girls only ; 12,465 schools were open all day ; 
3,210 were half-day schools, and 1,239 were partly half and partly whole-day 
schools. The number of male teachers was 44,838; that of female teachers, 13,- 
913. The average number of pupils to the teacher was 724. Eighty-three and

" seyen-tenths of the teachers were normal graduates, 11 per-cent had only a di- 
ploma, and 5.3 per cent had not yet acquired their diploma. Of the 16,688 ele- 
-mentary schools more than one-half, or 8,400, were ungraded, 3,916 were divided 
into classes of two grades, and the rest up to six, seven, and eight grades. 
- , Belgium.—The School Guardian (English), says of Belgian primary schools: : 
“The buildings are two stories high, having a gallery on the first floor running 
round the quadrangle. Each class has its own separate room, lofty, welllighted, 
and ventilated, but only from one side. The furniture consists of small tables 
- and benches, each sufficient for two or three scholars, and all facing the slightly 
raised platform for the teacher's desk. The tables have slates fixed horizon- 
tally in them. Blackboards are carried around the walls with compartments 
for the use of each schelar, on which he copies with chalk the sums or geometri- 
eal figures or sentences dictated to the class. This is done with a view to en- 
abling the master or mistress to see at a glance the work of each without having 
to pass‘round the room. In this way, too, the children have the advantage of a 
change of posture and find relief from the monotony of the lesson. The teach- 
ing is in all cases simultaneous. As no reading is taught in the ‘ Jardins d’En- 
fants’ or Infants’ Schools, the lowest classes have to learn the letters and their 
simplest combinations. These they enunciate together, and great pains are 
taken to make them give-each letter and syllable its full and correct sound. 
_ Writing is learned from a copy set on the blackboard. Around, vertical hand is 
_ taught without any distinction between the up and down strokes. Elementary 
drawing is obligatory in all the primary schools, and is taught by the ordinary 
teachers, who have no difficulty in teaching it, having practiced it in the nor- 
mal schools as well as previously in their own school days. 
ject is put before the class or drawn on the blackboard * : 
Bolivia.—Bolivia has four universities. The following figures are given for 
1888: Primary schools, 506, with 707 teachers, and 24,583 pupils, of whom 8,822 
are girls; secondary schools and colleges, 22, with 2,234 pupils; 774 students of 
      law, medicine, and theology, with 55 professors in the universities. The Gov-" 
ernment’s contribution to public primary schools in 1883 was 43,900 bolivianos. 
Bulgaria.—In 1890 Bulgaria had 3,844 elementary schools, with 129,777 boys, 
and 42,206 girls as pupils. The total number of boys of school age is 275,756; 
of girls, 261,968. For education the state grants a yearly subvention of 2,000,- 
000 lev. Education is fres and nominally obligatory for a period of four years. 
- About 81 per cent of the population can not read or write. There is a univer- 
- sity at Sofia, with gymnasia in the principal towns, including four for girls, be- 
sides several lower middle-class schools. There is.a free public library at Sofia. 
(Statesman’s Yearbook.) 
Ceylon.—The Buddists of Ceylon have taken a new departure. Hitherto their 
energy had been directed towards the welfare of the boys, for. whom no less 
than forty schools had been opened within recent years under the auspices of the 
Theosophical Society. But it had been long ago pointed out by Col. Olcott that 
the Sinhalese girls'should have a school of their own, where they might be 
brought up in harmony with their religious and national instincts. This idea 
was zealously worked out by a devoted Buddhist lady, Mrs. Weerakoon, and a 
band of her countrywomen, who, with praiseworthy activity, organized the 
Woman’s Educational Society, now numbering over 1,800 members. Within 
one year this society opened four girls’ schools—the Blavatsky school at Welle- 
watte, with about 100 children in daily attendance, and the girls’ schools at Kandy, 
Gampola, and Panedura. (Lond. Ed. Times.) 
China.—Education of a certain type is very general, but still there are vast 
masses of adult countrymen in China who can neither read nor write. Thereis 
a special literary, or lettered class who alone know the literature of their 
_ country, to the study of which they devote their lives. Yearly examinations 
are held for literary degrees and honors, which are necessary as a passport to 
the public service; and in 1887,for the first time, mathematics was admitted 
“with the Chinese classics among subjects of the examinations. Recently, ° 
_ Western literature and works of science have been introduced in translations, _ 
and schools for the propagation of Western science and literature are continually 
onthe increase. The principal educational institution for the purpose is the 
“Tung Wen Kwan,” or College 0° Foreign Knowledge at Peking, a Government 
institution, where the English, French, German and Russian languages, and 
mathematics, astronomy, meteorology, chemistry, natural history, physiology, 
- anatomy,and Western literatureare taught by European and American professors, 
_while the Chinese education of the pupils is intrusted to Chinese teachers. 
There are besides several colleges under the control of some of the numerous Some ordinary ob- * ” ::

  Roman Catholic and Protestant missionary bodies at Shanghai and other parts’ 
where the English languages and lower branches of Western science only forthe 
subjects of study. The Chinese Government has of late years established naval , 
_ and military colleges and torpedo schools in connection with the different arse- 
anals at Tientsin, Shanghai and Foochow in which foreign instructors are engaged      
1223 | 
to teach such young Chinese as intend tomake their career in the army andnavy off - 
their country, Western modes of warfare, beside Western languages and literature. 
The Chinese newspapers have for several years flourished at Shanghai, and the 
success they have achieved has led to the establishment of others at some of the — 
other treaty ports. (Statesman’s Yearbook.) 
Colombia.—In Colombia the religion of the nation is Roman Catholicism, 
other forms of religion being permitted, so long as their exercises are ‘‘not con- 
trary to Christian morals, nor to the law.” There are two universities and nu- 
merous colleges and special technical schools in the Republic. In 1889 there 
were 14 normal schools with 393 students, and 1,734 primary schools with 92,794 
pupils. Primary education is gratuitous but not compulsory. 7 
Costa Rica,—Kiducation in Costa Rica is compulsory and free. In 1890 there 
were 300 primary schools with 15,000 pupils, besides 90 private schools with 
2,500 pupils. In 1884 the number of children between 7 and 14 years.of age was 
27,245. In the budget for 1889-’90, $350,000 were devoted to education. 
Denmark.—Elementary education is widely diffused in Denmark, the attend- 
ance at school being obligatory from the age of 7 to 14. Education is afforded 
gratuitously in the public schools to children whose parents can not afford to pay 
for their teaching. The University of Copenhagen has about 1,300 students. 
Connected with the university is a polytechnic institution with 20 teachers and 
200 students. Between the university and the elementary schools there are 13 
public gymnasia or high schools, in the principal towns in the Kingdom, which 
afford a ‘‘ classical ” education, and 2} modern high schools. There are five 
teachers’ training colleges. Instruction at the public expense is given in paro- 
chial schools spread all over the/country, to the number, according to the latest — 
official statistics, of 2,940, namely, 28 in Copenhagen, 132 in the towns of Den- 
mark, and 2,780 in the rural districts; with 231,940 pupils in all, or 123 per thou- 
sand of population. (Statesman’s Yearbook.) 
Egypt.—In a recent work on Egyptian education (‘‘ L’Instruction Publique en 
Egypte,” by Yacoub Artin Pacha) is the following account of education that is 
pursued by the Egyptians—in fact, the education which has been in vogue with 
them for many centuries : 3 a 
Reading and writing are the first steps taken by tle child, who is at the same 
time set to learn a portion of the Koran by heart. As soon as he knows his let- 
ters and can read syllables he reads and writes the part of the ‘‘ Koran” com- 
mitted to memory, and so on, until the Holy Book is finished, a task generally 
taking 2 or3 years. These exercises of the memory are carefully graduated ac- 
cording to the child's age and ability. Then comes the study of grammar, the 
rules being set in rhyme, a plan for facilitating the work of the pupil not con- 
fined to the Mussulman world. The study of grammar, logic, rhetoric, etc., 
takes 3 or 4 years. Then follow 8 or 10 years of commentaries on the ‘‘Koran,” 
and after this period is completed the boy, who began at 6 or 8, is now, at 20 or 
22, a full-blown mondarris (professor) or cheikh (doctor). Most children leave 
school at 10 or 12 to take up a trade; those who are intended for a profession or 
for business leave after the grammar course ; only a few remain to pursue the 
higher course in religion and law. Of the latter some become kadi (judges) or 
mufti (awyers); the rest become teachers. The ideal of the founders of the~ 
universities had been to preserve the language of the elect, the language of the 
“ Koran.” 3 
-Arabic was reserved as the language of religion, tradition, and law. Beyond 
these three subjects all other instruction was intrusted to foreigners, with the 
single exception of mathematics, which was in the.hands of the Copts, who had 
distinguished themselves from early times as financiers. Mehemet Ali was the 
first to attempt to introduce European method into Egyptian pedagogy. In 1816 
he sent a body of young Mamelukes to England and Italy to learn engineering, 
etc., and in 1825 he founded a school of medicine, restricted to Egyptian students. 
From 1826 to 1834 large numbers of young men were sent to France to complete 
their studies; and to the general spread of European culture, resulting from 
these wise measures of Mehemet Ali, Egypt owes her 50 primary and secondary 
and her 16 technical schools. A council of public instruction was instituted in 
1836, but for 30 years the conservative influence of El] Azhar was too strong, and 
progress was infinitesimal. Ismail Pacha undertook a general reorganization 
   
-P-A-G-E-632
a 
  ~ 1224 ~ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
of the educational system of the country, and founded schools of law, language, 
science, and art, and a normal school. Since 1885 progress has been as rapid as 
could be expected, as will be seen from the tables at the end of this volume. 
A modus vivendi has been established between the state schools and the uni- 
versity and the divergence between the two systems is being gradually nar- 
rowed down. Artin Pacha looks forward, ‘patient in his impatience,” to see 
the seed sown by the great political and intellectual regenerator of Egypt bear- 
ing its fruits; nor dces he hesitate to express his belief that the ‘‘ancient and 
illustrious university mosque of El Azhar, animated by the scientific spirit which 
is urging us forward, will take its place by the side of its younger and more 
justly celebrated sisters, the universities of modern Europe, who have out- 
eunipped us in the past.” The education of women is: First, religion, given by 
chiekhs or women teachers; and, second, domestic, i.e., teaching, housekeeping, 
manners, embroidery, singing, and soon. Dancing, of course, is not a custom 
of respectable orientals. The age at which girls are married, viz, between 12 
and 16, is a serious impediment to a complete system of instruction. Curiously 
enough, even the limited instruction given at present is partly due to the estab- 
lishment of a midwifery school in 1836; the sages femmes were the partially in- 
nocent cause of the creation of a thirst for knowledge; at Bay rate they taught 
the elementary principles of hygiene in countless native families and this widen- 
ing of the horizon was productive of immediate good. 
. France.-—M. Antoine Albalat, in an article in the Nouvelle Revue, draws a most 
harrowing picture of the results of the purely theoretical educational system, 
which, until a few years ago, was looked upon as a panacea of all evils. France, 
nowadays, he says, is nothing but a large civil-service employment agency. 
And the struggle for life with us means the race for government and other posts. 
Thanks to political equality and free education, which have reduced all toa 
_ dead level, the French nation, once so fertile in ideas and so original, threatens 
- to become nothing but a nation of civil servants and pedagogues. Just count 
the number of place seekers! The prefect of the department of the Seine pub- 
‘lished a few months ago the following list of vacancies and applicants in that 
department: Junior clerks, 4 vacancies, 4,398 applicants; male teachers, 42 va- 
cancies, 7,139 applicants; drawing masters, 3 vacancies, 147 applicants ; custom- 
house clerks, 165 vacancies, 2,773 applicants ; surveyors, 1 vacancy, 1,338 appli- 
cants. The civil service, the post-office, the telegraph office, and the schools 
have all greatly increased their teaching force, and they are at present the bane 
of our country. France may be roughly divided into those who hold positions 
and those who seek them. The vast majority of Frenchmen have only one 
dream, to be kept by the state, to live on the public taxes. Parents have no 
other ambition for their children—the civil servant, the young man who draws 
Government pay, is their ideal son-in-law, 
Even the sons of the soil are streaming into the towns, be it only to sit behind 
the pay desk. But the women are more to be pitied. In default of marriage, 
they are seeking work, especially as teachers. But how soon they are unde- 
ceived! Read the bitter plaints with which they continually fill the ears of the 
minister of education. The state promised them a peaceable, respectable life, 
with a secure income; and thousands of them are without positions, on the 
vergé of despair, and fall an easy prey to temptation. No one will ever know 
the number of these victims of arithmeticand French history that are swallowed 
up by the great gulf of vice. ‘‘I know nothing more sad than this,” exclaims 
M. Albalat. Here is the result of our theoretical, Utopian, and modern educa- 
tion! We talk of afourth estate. There isa fifth estate, namely, the women 
who have to earn their living by their brains. (Lond. Jl. of Ed.) 
Germany.—Prof. Weber, of Steglitz, near Berlin, who acted for some time as 
assistant principal in English schools, answers the question: ‘‘ Do English schools 
deserve to be considered models for German schools ?” in the negative. 
‘‘Any observant foreigner who has lived in England,” says he, ‘‘even if only 
for a short time, must have been struck with the great self-consciousness of the 
Englishman, which quality is already developed toa high degree in the little 
boy. The Englishman is proud of the language of his country, of its riches, and 
* of its institutions. As aconsequence it isa common fault with him to depreciate 
other nations and to overrate himself and his ownpeople. To this national self- 
  not under any circumstances be deprived of them, either by the state or by the 
church, and he hates all bureaucratic ways, or, as he calls it, ‘ red-tape business.’ 
Then he possesses a profound respect for the law and for the existing institu- 
tions of the state, as well as in general a true sense of religion, which sense is 
    reliance he adds a great love of individual liberty andself-dependence. He will

greatlyfostered and enhanced byhisfamily life. Moreover, we find in the English- : 
man the singular inclination to ask first of allineverything he undertakes: ‘Of 
what use is it?’ ‘Englishmen can not take anything easy,’ says Karl Hilde- 
brand in ‘Briefe aus England,’ ‘neither can they take anything idealistically. 
_They transpose everything at once into the practical. English idealism is al- 
ways practical, incontradistinction to the German, which manifests itself in ar- 
tistic contemplation.’ To this practical sense the English partly owe their 
supremacy upon the seas, and we Germans, who but ashort time since began to 
acquire colonies, may learn very much in this respect from the practical Eng- 
lishman. \ 
“These different peculiarities of the English characfer are distinctly ex- 
pressed in the English schools; they exert a mutual influence upon each other 
and are mutually dependent upon one another. 
“A's the whole life of the Englishman is chiefly based on the principle of util- 
ity, so also in his school life he places this principle in the first rank. 
“The average Englishman does not, asa rule, strive after knowledge if he 
does not see his way to make practical use of it; in other words, he does not pur- 
sue knowledge for her own sake. This principle is very dangerous and perni- 
cious to the intellectual progress of apeople, and it is not to be wondered that a 
notion.or a true idea of the elements of science is unknown to the great masses. 
“Por the language, literature, and the history of other nations,’ Mr Bren- 
necke rightly says, ‘for efforts in art which adorn and cheer the innerlife, the 
average Englishman, deducting, of course, amateurs, the upper 10,000, and spe- 
cialists, have no time in life,’ because, I add, he does not understand nor appre- 
ciate them. We Germans are, however, only too easily inclined to lay too much 
stress upon the scientific side of things, and in so doing to forget often the prac- 
tical use of the results we obtain. 
‘“‘The English system cares little about the acquirement of manifold knowl- 
  edge by the pupils and the scientific treatment of the subjects, but it tries, be- — 
fore all, to fulfill two tasks: Firstly, to develop the physique of the pupil, to 
make him in all respects healthy and capable of resistance, and to harden him 
against physical and moral injury. This having been accomplished, the teach- 
er’s aim is to develop in the vigorous body an independent, firm character; he 
will accustom the boys to absolute truth, candor, and resoluteness; they must 
quickly and independently find the right thing and learn to execute. In aword, 
the English master educates; the German rather instructs. 
“A great difference between English and German school arrangements con- — 
sists in this: The English Government pays no attention to the higher and 
middle schools. An organization and superintendence of the schools by the 
state, as in Germany, does not exist; these schools are either a private com-_ 
mercial speculation or they have been founded by old and often very rich en- 
dowments or by corporations. ‘The Englishman is far too independent to allow 
the state the right of prescribing for him the education of his children. But 
there are already reasonable Englishmen enough who believe that a firm or- 
.ganization of all schools by the state can do more for education in general than 
the doubtful trade of private schools, and they demand the same institution as 
in Germany. In Scotland state superintendence was introduced in 1885. 
“ Thus the state can give no prerogatives to schools, and that at least is very 
good, for the prerogatives given to our schools do a great deal of harm in hin- 
dering their free development. 
“T will not, however, forget to mention that a certain supervision of schools is 
exercised in England by the press and literature, and the power of the press 
over the masses is much greater in England than with us. 
“A certain uniformity in scholastic matters between th> more superior public 
and even private schools is to be seen in the local examinations, which are held 
annually by the universities. : 
‘Some secondary schools also submit voluntarily every year to regular ex- ~ 
aminations, for their own credit’s sake, ‘so as to give the world confidence in 
them.’ But in comparison to a firm organization these examinations can be 
but a miserable makeshift. Mr. Raydt informs us that for some time there 
have been held regular meetingsof school principals, which might, indeed, havea, 
good influence upon the formation of a uniform plan of teaching; but why are 
the debates of these meetings not published, asin Prussia? By these means 
they would become of common service to every teacher. In this regard I can not 
sufficiently praise the reports of the school inspectors on the elementary schools_ 
inspected by them in their districts. ‘These reports are printed in the Parlia- 
mentary papers and contain many interesting and useful points. 3

‘It is the German elementary schoo]. work by which the English should 
learn how salutary is the supervision of schools by the state, and how they 
should especially reform their middle-class or secondary schools.” 
’ Guatemala.—Primary education in Guatemala is obligatory, maintained by the 
. state,freeand secular, Thesum spent on education in 1$87~’88 (ending June 
30) was $525,625, of which $253,927 were for primary education. In 1887 there 
* were 93,627 children of school age. At the end of 1889 there were, according to 
official statements, 1,327 primary sehools of all kinds, attended by 47,907 pupils, 
and 66 higher schools, with 3,677 pupils. There were in addition 7 high and 
normal schools, with 1,185 pupils (3815 females). 
rz Montenegro.—Schools for elementary education in Montenegro are support2d 
. by Government; education is compulsory and free ; there are (1889) 70 elemen- 
tary schools, with 3,000 male and 300 female pupils. All males under the age of 
_ 25 years are supposed to be able to read and write. There isa theological semi- 
- nary and a gymnasium or college for boys at Cettinje, and a girls’ high school 
maintained at the charge of the Empress of Russia. : 
Hawaii.—The Kingdom, of- Hawaii (comprising eight large productive and 
_ thirteen small desolate islands), with 80,000 inhabitants, is of special importance 
for commercial intercourse between North America and East Asia. 1t is well 
known that the recently decedsed King Kalakaua, in 1881, made an extensive 
tour through America and Europe. Huropz2an institutions and therewith Chris. 
tianity were introduced in Hawaii at the beginning of our century and special 
- attention was given to education. The United States exert the greatest influ- 
ence upon the administration of this Kingdom and covertly aim at the protectorate 
over the Kingdom. Its annexation on the part of the United States is only a 
question of time. 
_ From the main island public education was. diffused over the whole Kingdom 
in a comparatively short time. At the beginning of the second degade of our 
century the chieftain and his most distinguished subjects diligently studied read- 
ing and writing. This awakened everywhere the desire tolearn these wonderful 
arts. The most able men among the adult students were sent as teachers to all 
: parts of the country, and the throng to their schools was so great that in 1827 
if _ there were 52,000 persons studying in 900 schools, or more than half the number 
of the inhabitants were eagerly engaged in acquiring the elements of learning. 
ys In 1832 the number of natives who could read amounted to 32,000, of whom 
_ nearly all werealso able to write. Atpresent there isin operation in Lahainaluna 
a normal school for the training of preachers and teachers, who alternately de- 
vote themselves to intellectual and physical work, as the students earn their 
living by the tilling of a farm belonging to the institution. Manual work takes 
a prominent place in all schools of the little Kingdom. Education is obligatory 
for both sexes from§ to 15 years of age (formerly 4 to 14). A peculiar feature 
is the regulation in force that anybody who can not read or write is prohibited 
from obtaining public office and also forbidden to marry. 
“ The Kingdom is divided into twenty-three school districts, each of which is 
ae under the supervision of an inspector. This official superintends the manage- 
i ment of the schools; both the instruction and the buildings and sites. He is re- 
quired to furnish quarterly a report to the central authority. The school year 
has forty-one school weeks. ‘The daily sessions are from 9 to 2 o’clock, with one 
-or tivo intermissions. Sunday and Saturday are holidays. There are different 
_ Classes of schools: 
1. Primary schools (common schools), where the entire instruction is given in 
the espe language. ~ 
2, English schools, where the English language is the means of instruction. 
3. Private schools, in which both languages are used. 
The school at Lihue, on the island of Hawaii, in which German and English 
are taught, belongs to the third class and is attended by children of German 
workingmen only. For children of the aristocracy there is a kind of secondary 
school that took its name from the street in which it is situated, ‘‘ Fort Street, 
School.” Protestant missionaries established near Honolulu, on the island of 
Qahu, the principal city of the country, the-‘‘Qahu College,” after the pattern 
of French schools. Catholic missionaries also established schools whose text-- , 
books are, with few exceptions, printed at Honolulu in the native language. 
Thedirection of the entire educational system has beenassigned toa “bureau” or 
“board,” consisting of five members, of which three are natives who were edu- 
- eatedinthecountry. Thepresident, at present Mr. Bishop,wasformerlysecretary 
_ ofthe state department; previous to thatya member of the house of nobles and 
__ president of the legislative body. This bureau appoints the teachers and super- 
intends the expenditure of the money appropriated by ths representatives of the

people. Itnominates a general superintendent for the whole educational sys- 
tem, who visits each school of the country twice a year toexamine the pupils and 
the condition of the school. He reports to the bureau or board. In order to ful- 
fill his duties the general superintendent is obliged every year to travel 800 miles 
on horseback and 1,600 miles by water. During the school year 1888-89, there 
were in the Kingdom 179 schools, 63 primary, 69 English and 47 private schools, 
with 8,770 pupils (4,952 boys, 3,818 girls), with a teaching force of 334 members 
(177 men, 157 women). At the last exposition in Paris, in 1889, there was on ex- 
hibition pupils’ work from Hawaii, nearly all of which was expressed.in good 
English and in pleasing form. . 
The educational system in Hawaii furnishes proof of how much one can do if 
stimulated by earnestness of intention. Scarcely sixty years have passed since 
the first pioneers of public education commenced their work.in Hawaii, and al-— 
ready its public school system can compare with that of Europe. 3 
The state, however, has easy sailing because it has the schools, and no obsta-— 
cles are raised by the church, since religious societies and the clergy are excluded. 
from the management of school affairs. (Freie pid Blatter.) " 
Ehingary.—Count Albion Casky, the minister of public instruction in Hungary, 
has recently issued in the German language asynopsis of his annual report, in ~ 
which he says that he considers professional supervision and a thoroughly 
trained corps of teachers the most important factors of progress in any school 
system. So far as figures can speak, certainly Hungary has made rapid progress - 
during the last twenty years. The report shows acomparison between the state 
' of affairs in 1859 and 1889, from which we cull the following items: : 
I. Elementary Schools—In 1889, 2,015,612 children attended school, while in 
1869 only 1,152,115. In comparison with the number of children of school age 
between 1869 and 1889, an increase of attendance from 40.42 per cent to 80.65 
per cent is recorded. While in 1869 1,598 communities were without any 
schools, that number had decreased to 244 in 1889. The number of schools in 
1869 was 13,798; in 1889 it was 16,702. In 1869 the number of teachers was 17,792, 
while in 1889 it had increased to 24,645. The expenditures for maintaining 
elementary schools in 1869 were only $1,342,363, but in 1889 they amounted to 
$5,396,777. While in 1869 the state’s subvention to elementary schools was only 
$14,556, it was $6,505,315 in 1889. The great increase recorded above is found ~ 
only in those portions of the Kingdom inhabited by psople of the Hungarian, 
German, and Ruthenian tongues. The attendance of Roumanian, Servian, and 
Slavakish children is in a rather backward condition. 
Il. Secondary schools.—The Kingdom has 180 secondary schools; that is, 151 
gymnasia, or classical colleges, and 29 realschulen, or modern colleges. One 
hundred and thirteen are complete in their organization, while sixty-seven had 
not quite completed their organization, lacking the senior classes. The classi- 
cal schools were attended by 36,367 students, or 83.3 per cent; the modern by 
7,303 students, or 16.7 per cent. The minister remarks thatthe attendance in 
modern schools is increasing faster than in the classical schools. 
IIL. Superior schools.—Concerning universities, technical and other superior 
institutions, the minister reports that the candidates for the profession of teach- 
ing and students of technical, agricultural, and military schools are increasing — 
in number faster than those of the universities. In the universities he notices: 
that the law faculties and academies are still overcrowded, as in former years, 
while the number of candidates for theology, medicine, forestry, and mining is 
decreasing.. An interesting feature of the superior education in Hungary is 
this: The examination for graduation must be exceptionally rigorous, for of 877 
candidates for the legal profession only 521 (that is, 594 per cent) passed the ex- — 
amination ; of 297 medical students, only 207 (or 69 per cent); of 140 students 
of the philosophic faculty, only 38 (or 27 per cent); of 210 students of the Poly- 
technicum, only 80 (or 38 per cent) passed. 
Jtaly.—A new school for Italy is now under the consideration of the council of 
public instruction, and its provisions are foreshadowed in the ‘‘ New Educator ” 
of Rome. It is proposed to transfer the charge of the infant schools from the 
minister of the interior to the minister of instruction, and the age of compulsory 
attendance is raised to twelve years. The appointment of teachers is left in the 
hands of the communal boards. Teachers under 21 years of age will only be 
provisionally appointed ; on coming of age their status will be improved, and at. 
the age of 24 they will be recognized as fully responsible teachers. Theneeforth 
they will be removable only for grave offenses specified in the bill; their dismis- — 
sal will have to b2 approved by the provincial board of education, and an appeal 
to the minister will probably be allowed. 
       
-P-A-G-E-636
        1228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Sehool-inspector Gen. Pisani has recently published a book on the Italian 
schools which is designed to show what progress public education has made dur- 
- ing recent years in Italy. The number of elementary pupils in 1889-90 was 
2,102,615 (or 1,094,467. boys and 1,008,148 girls); this is an increase of 55,000 over 
the previous year. Of the sum total, 1,966,988 pupils were in public schools, 
135,627 in private schools. The number of classes in the public schools was 
78,675, hence the average number of pupils per class room was 25. The private 
_ schools had 8,791 classes, which is an average of 15 pupils per class room. The 
number of teachers, however, 1s not equal to the number of classes; it is only 
41,336 for public and 5,063 for private schools. The number of teachers shows 
an increase of 1,500 over the previous year. It is evident that most of the teach- 
ers teach two classes a day. The hygienic conditions of the schools and the 
school furniture are said to be anything but satisfactory. The teachers are not 
well prepared for their profession and their standing in society is very inferior. 
The communal authorities are said to be irregular in paying their teachers. A 
law is being prepared which will protect the teachers from arbitrary action on 
_ the part of the local authorities, and securing the payment of a minimum salary 
by the state. 
Japan.—The house of representatives in the new diet of Japan is extremely 
anxious to cut down the budget, and a conflict is imminent between it and the 
government on this subject. Its proposals are sweeping, and if carried out. 
would cause no little consternation in the education department. The grant 
for schools would be reduced from $800,000 to about half that sum. Some five 
years since the late Viscount Mori, who perished by an assassin’s knife on the 
day of the declaration of the constitution, just two years ago, established five 
great secondary schools in different centers throughout the Empire, to act as 
feeders for the university and to serve as a check on the growing congestion of 
students in the capital. These institutions are specially threatened by the par- 
liamentary reformers, many of whom hold Spencerian views and dislike govern- 
ment control in education. Generally speaking, this is a critical time for edu- 
cation in Japan. The rising generation is growing up without those habits of 
instinctive obedience and reverence which characterized the previous civiliza~ 
tion, and the capable teachers are all young and comparatively untried men. 
The question how to preserve sound morality and discipline in the schools is 
causing grave concern at headquarters. There is a conservative government at 
full flow just now; the demand for foreigners as teachers is at ebb, the schools 
in most cases preferring Japanese who can help them to translate. Foreigners 
have never been so unpopular since the great revolution. 
There is a troublesome class in the capital known as soshi, a word which is 
difficult to translate so as to convey an adequate meaning. They are not stu- 
dents, though so described sometimes, but rather political unattached meddlers 
who wouid right all wrongs by use of the sword, sticks, and bombs. They pro- 
_ fess to be intense patriots, and are certainly in many cases reckless of their lives 
and most deliberate in carrying out their plans. ‘he only school in which 
anything of the soshi spirit has appeared is the secondary school of Tokio, some 
of the students in which have once or twice disgraced themselves. (London 
Journal of Education.) 
Mexico.—The Pedagogium (Dresden and Vienna) of March, 1891, contains an 
- interesting account of recent educaticnal movements in our neighbor republic, 
written by a resident, whose name is withheld by the editor, Dr. ®. Dittes. 
For a number of years both the central government, as well as the officials of 
the separate states, have made praiseworthy efforts to promot2. public instruc- 
tion, and particularly.to bring the education of the masses to a level worthy our 
century, and by doing so to lift the degree of culture of the nation in morals, 
science, and material welfare, so that Mexico might occupy a place among the 
civilized nations of the world corresponding to its advantageous natural condi- 
tions and resources. 
However, these efforts and the willingness to make grand sacrifices have not 
been crowned with the success which one would justly be entitled to expect, if 
the enormous sums are considered that were expended for the purpose. 
_ The main causes of this lamentable fact are, the want of well-trained profes- 
sional teachers; frequent misunderstanding of educational theories taken from 
foreign pedagogical works; the blind acceptationor rejection of new ideas, meth- 
ods, and theories in accordance with the firstimpression; finally, the chaosaris- 
ing from the fact that every state, however small it may be, and although all 
are subject to the same central government, has its own school legislation. 
Hence, in the preparation of teachers in the studies of elementary and secondary 
  /

schools there is no uniformity in the curricula, and from year to year, even 
within the course of one school year, changes are made which prolong or shorten 
the course. The student is obliged, under such circumstances, to lose time and 
means in order to adjust himself to the same conditions in case he moves across 
the border of his little state. More frequently he loses confidence in science and _ 
its teachers. . The same chaos prevails in the philosophic fundamental principles 
according to which science is taught in the higher seats of learning. 
While here pedagogy is taught after Herbert Spencer and psychology a priori 
after Jaime Balmes, at another place psychology is taught after Spencer ‘and 
logic after Tiberghien; here flourishes the positivism of August Compte side by 
side with the rationalism of Krause and Ahrens, and again at another place we 
find the philosophy of St. Thomas of Aquino luxuriating under the shadow of 
Charles Darwin. ~ 
Orange Free State.—The system of education in Orange Free State is national. 
Small grants are also made to the Episcopal and Roman Catholic Churches. 
The government schools are managed by elected local boards, which choose the 
teachers, who are appointed by the President if he is satisfied with their quali- 
fications. Education is not compulsory nor free, except for very poor children. 
In 1890, 17,000 livres was allotted to education, being a portion of interest on a 
capital of 200,000 livres set apart by the “ Volksraad” for this purpose. In 1889 
there were 49 government schools, inclusive of the two higher schools and the 
infant school at Bloemfontein, with 2,139 pupils and 74 teachers. Grants are_ 
made to private schools on certain conditions. In 1889 there were 14 such 
schools with 211 pupils. The Grey College, the highest school for boys, pre- 
pares candidates for the matriculation of the Cape University. Thereis a similar 
school for girls. (Statesman’s Yearbook.) 
Ecuador.—The religion of the republic of Ecuador, according to the consti- | 
tution, is the Roman Catholic, to the exclusion of every other. Primary edu- 
cation is gratuitous.and obligatory. There is a university at Quito and uni- 
versity bodies at Cuenca and Guyaquil. There are 37 secondary schools and 856 
vimary schools, with, according to official statistics, about 60,000 pupils. There 
is a scientific institution in Quito with 11 professors and 50 students. There are 
commercial, technical schools, and military schools. 
Persia.—In Persia there are a great number of colleges (medresseh) supported 
‘by public funds, in which students are instructed in religion and Persian and 
Arabic literature, as well as in a certain amount of scientific knowledge, and- 
many schools for children, while private tutors are very common, being em- 
ployed by all families who have the means. A polytechnic school with a num- 
ber of European professors, opened in Teheran forty years ago, has done much 
towards introducing the knowledge of Western languages and science into Per- 
sia. There are also military colleges at Teherfn and Tabriz; but the bulk of 
the population are taught only to read the Koran. ‘ 
Pevu.—In Peru elementary education is compulsory for both sexes, and is free 
in the public schools that are maintained by the municipalities. High schools 
are maintained by the government in the capitals of the departments, and in 
some provinces pupils pay a moderate fee. -There is in Lima a central univer- 
sity called ‘‘ Universidad de San Marcos,” the most ancient in America. Its 
charter was granted by the Emperor, Carlos V. It has faculties of jurispru- 
dence, medicine, political science, theology, and applied science. Lima possesses 
a school of mines and civil engineering, created in 1874, with good collections 
and laboratories. There are in the capital and in some of the principal towns 
private high schools under the direction of English,German, and Italian teach- 
ers. Lima has also a public library with a rich collection, besides the one of 
the university and school of mines. There are two minor universities at Cuzco 
and Arequipa. (Statesman’s Yearbook.) 
Portugal.—In Portugal the superintendence of public instruction is under the 
management of a superior council of education at the hedd of which is the min- 
ister of the interior. Public education is entirely free from the supervision and 
control of the church. By a law enacted in 1844, it is compulsory for parents to 
send their children to a place of public instruction; but this prescription is far 
from being enforced, and only a very small number of children of the middle and 
lower: classes really attend school. According to official returns of the total 
population at the close of 1878 the number of illiterate inhabitants in Portugal 
and its islands is stated to be 3,751,774, or 82 per cent of the total population, in- 
cluding, however, young children. The total school population in 1885 was 332,- 
281. tn the year 1887 there were 3,739 public primary schools with 179,089 pupils, 
and 1,608 privaté primary schools with 60,725-pupils. The total day school at- A FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES.

tendance of 329,800 gave an average of 50.9 per cent per 1,000 inhabitants. “For. 
_ secondary instruction there were 22 lyceums with 215 teachers; 74 private 
schosls and a royal military college with 272 students. For higher instruction 
there are (1887) the following schools and colleges: The University of Coimbra, 
"founded in 1290, with faculties of law, medicine, mathematics, and philosophy, 
774 students; the polytechnic schools of Lisbon, and Oporto, 354 students; the 
medical schools at Lisbon, Oporto, and Funchal, 286 students; a military and a 
naval school at Lisbon,an agricultural and veterinary institute at Lisbon, anda 
higher school of literature. For cial instruction there are: The industrial 
and commercial institutes at Lisbon and Oporto with (1887)1,222 pupils; 140ther 
. industrial schools with 1,078 pupils, 4 artillery and 2 naval schools (corvettes) 
‘with together 314 pupils; and 15 teachers’ seminaries with 3,838 students. The 
clergy are educated in 22 establishments, where most of them receive gratui- 
tous instruction. Schools of agriculture are being established in various parts 
of the country. 
The expenditure of the ministry of public instruction, according to the budget 
of 1890-91, is 1,102,283 milreis, exclusive of 643,223 milreis to be expended 
through other ministries. (Statesman’s Yearbook.) 
Russia.—The Government is making strong efforts at Russifying the Grand 
Duchy of Finland. All the secondary schools have received a new course of 
study in which the Russia, language predominates. Thus the Baltic provinces 
with their almost exclusive German -population and Finland with its Swedish 
opulation are to be made Russian provinces in fact as they are now in name. 
.. (Paed. Ztg.) 
Roumania.—In Roumania education is freeand compulsory ‘‘ wherever there 
_ are schools,” but is still in a very backward condition. There are about 3,000 
primary schools with 130,000 pupils, or about 2 per cent of the population (in 
Great B: in the proportion is 12.3 per cent). There are 8 normal schools with 
- 800 pupils; 54 high schools with 8,000 pupils; 2 universities (Bucharest and 
Jassy) with faculties in law, philosophy, science, and medicine, and having about 
100 professors and teachers and 800 students. 
Salvador.—Education is free and obligatory in Salvador. In 188% there were 
_ 182 primary schools with 27,000 pupils; 18 higher schools (including 2 normal 
~ and 1 polytechnic school) with 1,293 pupils, and a national university with fac- 
‘ulties of jurisprudence, medicine, natural sciences, and engineering, attended by 
- 180 students. 
In the capital is a national library and museum, and in the republic 13 news- 
papers are published. 
Transvaal.—There are 10 English schools in Pretoria, and one or more in each 
of the other towns. According to the report of the acting superintendent of ed- 
ucation for the year 1888, the sum of £24,987 was spent for the education of 5,475 
“pupils. In 1889 there were 28 village schools and 196 ward schools, besides a 
gymnasium with 173 pupils at Pretoria. The establishment of a university is 
contemplated and £20,000 were voted for the purpose by the Volksraad. 
Santo Domingo.—Primary instruction in Santo Doningo is gratuitous and ob- 
ligatory,being supported by the communes and by central governments, The pub- 
lic or state schools are, primary, superior, technical schools, normal schools, and 
a professional school with the character of a university. On December 31, 1884, 
when the last school census was taken, there were 201 municipal schools for 
primary instruction, with 8 pupils. It is estimated that there are now 300 
schools with about 10,000 pupils. 
There are several literary societies in the capital and other towns, and in the 
republic there are published about forty newspapers. (Statesman’s Yearbook.)

17.—PENSIONS. 
_-_ -Scotland.—Glasgow has a scheme for the pensioning of teachers which it will 
be interesting for American leaders to study. The actuary has worked out the 
details with great care. It applies to all employés of the school board. There 
are six classes—headmasters, assistant male teachers, assistant female teachers, 
office staff, janitors, and compulsory officers. The first three classes only are 
considered in detail, and the assessments of salaries are made at the following 
rates : Headmasters, 8 per cent; assistant male teachers, 5 per cent, and assistant 
female teachers, 8} percent, the total amount of the capital fund required to be 
found at present being $300,000, or, including the other three classes, $350,000. 
There were in June, 1889, in the employment of the board 67 headmasters, rang- 
ing in age from 35 to 65; the average scale of salary ranging from $1,250 to $2,000

ing from $300 to $650, and averaging $465, and whose ages ranged from 20 to 59— ~ 
only 6, however, being above 44 years. The assistant female teachers numbered 
335, and the average scale of salary was from $250 to $450. Of these only 25 were . 3 
over 40 years of age, the largest class being that between 25 and 29 years. Al- 
though, as a general rule, the rate of salary increases with age, that rule is not 
invariable. Among the female assistants the highest average salary is between 
the ages of 40 and 44, in which class the average is $455; and amongst male 
assistants the same class stands highest, with an average salary of $635, (School- — 
master.) 
England.—‘‘ It is indisputable,” says the Birmingham Daily Gazette, ‘‘thata 
large percentage of school masters and mistresses would not be able to put by even 
a shilling a week without feeling the loss of it. In villages the salaries of mis- 
tresses range from $175 to $300 a year, and of masters from $200. to $ Tt is 
by no means uncommon to find that on these earnings a man is keeping a wife 
and family, and, as is well known, it would be greatly to his disadvantage not to 
keep up the appearance of being fairly well off. ‘To compel these people to 
make provision for old_age is only to increase their present difficulties, and if 
any such scheme was adopted which required a pension premium, its operation 
would have to be limited to those ease 
them altogether, teachers are nota particularly provident class, and consider- 
ing that they are aware that old age and infirmity must disqualify them from 
performing their duties, itis remarkab!e that they so seldon think of the future 
and prepare to meet emergencies.” 
     
  The leading exponent of the opinion of the Church of England has been turn-— 
ing to the subject of paying pensions to elementary teachers, and declares itself 
in favor of government interference. If one could ‘‘put back the clock” just 45 
years to the time when licensed teachers were just being called into being, it 
would be easy, in the opinion of many, to say that each licensed teacher should 
pay $10 a year into a pension fund, to be met by a similar sum out of the Parlia- 
mentary grant, and thus secure a valuable sum, payable on death, should that 
event occur before the teacher has reached the age of €5, and an income of $200 
a year forever afterward. And if some such rule had been adopted our English 
elementary teachers would now all of them be in the position of their fellow- 
workers in almost every continental European country, where, as Mr. Arnold 
testified, pension schemes for primary teachers are practically universal. 
It is, of course, perfectly possible for Parliament (adds the Guardian) to-enact 
such a rule in the case of all persons who in future shall join the ranks of the 
teaching profession. But what in the mean while is to be done with the 43,500 
existing teachers for whom no such rule was made when it was possible for them 
to observe it? In the intérest of education as well as humanity we plead for an 
early consideration of this question. Teachers who go about their tasks with a 
feeling of security as to the future will do infinitely better in their trying work 
than those for whom the future is a blank, unrelieved by any prospect but that 
of a cheerless old age in the workhouse. If the state peso the whole respon- 
sibility for finding pensions at the age of 65 (still further contends the Guard- 
ian) for every licensed teacher, inasmuch as with the present total of 43,500 
teachers there would probably never be more than about 6,000 over 65 years of 
age, the whole cost of pensioning those persons off at $200 a year would be less 
than a quarter of a million pounds. And what is a quarter of a million pounds 
(in this case 6,000 x 200 = $1,200,000) for the worn-out teachers by the side 
of the £2,000,000 a year with which Parliament has just endowed the parents of 
elementary scholars ? 
18.—PSYCHOLOGY. 
Synopsis of “Historical Sketch of the Idea of Apperception.”—(1) Leibniz, who 
first used the term “‘apperception” gives it the significance of consciousness or 
distinct, conscious conceiving, coupled with remembrance, in contradistinction — 
to weak perceptions which make impressions on the senses, but not in conscious- ~ 
ness ; and again he defines it as an act of taking hold of the contents of a concept 
by arbitrary attention or as a reflexive cognition of our inner conditions, or, in 
Short, as self-observation. Apperception with Leibniz has the characteristic of 
spontaneity, only dependent upon the determinative influence of the existing-— — 
i. €., accumulated—contents of the soul. 
(2) Kant finds that the sense impressions and inner emotional experiences offer 
the raw formless-material of cognitions. With the did of imagination these cog- 
  in which fair salaries are paid. Take <

nitions are fitted into forms of space and time already existing in the soul. But * 
in order that they may obtain the significance of concepts, certain innate pure 
notions of the understanding are added so as to connect them. He assumes the 
existence cf certain categories grouped under the heads of quantity, quality, re- 
lation, and modality. As he assumes two sources of knowledge, (1) sensual and 
emotional experience which offer the material, and (2) our s:lf- active interior 
erg which molds the material into forms, so he assumes two faculties corresponding 
_ with these sources: (1) the faculty to receive impressions, (2) the faculty to call 
‘ferth representations. The former istermed ‘‘ receptivity of the senses,” the lat- 
ter ‘‘spontancity of the understanding.” But previous toa'l this are, ‘‘a priori” 
the pure concepts of space and time, as well as the pure notions of the under-. 
- standing which we add to the experience as something inborn. This sponta- 
neous activity, which combines in self-consciousness the various impressions 
entering through the senses, is called ‘‘apperception.” He also calls it ‘‘self- 
_ consciousness.” 
(3) Herbart thinks that every perception entering consciousness through the 
senses acts upon the concepts present as an irritant or stimulant, pressing back 
everything contrary to it and attracting all similar concepts. All concepts in 
consciousness are grouped, and a new perception induces new conditions among 
them, i. ¢., fusing or arresting a fusion of concepts. It is like a light casting its 
shine all around upon the existing mass of concepts. The new percept in the 
center at first has a controlling influence, and attracts similar and repels dis- 
similar concepts. It joins those with which it establishes relation and is assimi- 
lated by them. At times it is so powerful thatit changes the complexion of the 
already accumulated group of concepts which it joins. This assimilation of the 
new matter by concepts already existing is apperception, and hence Herbart 
- finds no spontaneity init. Even the categories (see Kant) are to him results of 
adjustment between the simple concepts and groups of related concepts. Search- 
ing for the conditions of apperception, he recognized and emphasized the im- 
ortance of that residue or store of concepts acquired in the course of life; that 
is, its importance for the acquisition of new impressions and experiences. With 
that the definition of apperception as a resultant of gradual development of the 
aN mind is given. 
: (4) Lazarus claims that in the process of apperception two stages must be dis- 
tinguished: that of action and reaction. The soul may react upon sense im- 
- pressions in two ways: first, according to its original nature, then according to 
the nature acquired by its previous activity. In the former case the result is 
perception, in the latter apperception. Every perception is also an appercep- 
tion; that is, a reaction of the soul filled more or less with the contents of 
former processes (concepts). The soul, as a sensible being, perceives according 
to its original nature, and it apperceives according fo the elements acquired 
through earlier actions. An apperception is not added to complete a percep- 
cess tion, but perception is formed under the assisting and essentially determinative 
eo influence of apperception. Hence, generally speaking, apperception may be 
Fe considered as a reaction of the soul (filled with contents of former action) against 
outer and inner perception. He also calls attention to the importance of uncon- 
scious perception, as well as that of feelings and tendencies, moods and volition. 
(5) Steinthal sees in apperception aresult rather than an action. Thenew per- 
cept entering consciousness through the senses meets masses of concepts and 
thereby cognition is generated (that is apperception takes place). The new per- 
cept seeks, as it were, memory images of thesame or simi!ar objects of observa- 
tion, being interpreted by them, measured, and put in rank and file, to speak 
figuratively. Like other philosophers he lays much stress upcn the emotional 
action of the soul in facilitating or checking these processes of degenerating, which 
by him are termed apperception. The soul’s contents consisting of well artic 
lated groups of concepts and series of thoughts react with. different force. 
Some groups which are reproduced regularly, such as one’s professional ideas, 
apperceive,more readily. That group always apyerceives which either abso- 
lutely, or only in the special case, proves the most powerful. A chief condition 
for the relative power of the concepts is interest which causes attention. 
(6) Waitz speaks of residua, remainders, that is, aftereffects of perceptions in 
the soul by which all subsequent conditions of the soul are modified. In earliest 
s childhood a confused mass caused by simultaneousness of different impressions, 
2. apperceives all separate sense impressions ; but in later years no pure and iso- 
lated perception can take place kecause the interior is always preoccupied by a 
greater number of remainders of previous processes with which the new percep- 
tion has to make terms. ‘

(7) Wundt, using a simile, says: The concepts which at a given moment exist 
in consciousness differ with regard to their distinctness. This fact may be com- 
pared with a similar phenomenon observed in the act of seeing. The pictures 
of outer objects which are formed on the retina are most distinct atthe point called 
the focus. Their clearness diminishes more and more thefarther away they are 
from that point. Taking consciousness as an inner seeing it may be said thatall 
concepts present at one moment are within the field of vision, while only one is 
in the focus of consciousness. The entrance of an image into the field of vision 
he defines as perception ; its entrance into the point of vision (focus) as apper- 
ception, and to bring it to that point a definite psychical actionis necessary, 
namely this: The image being present with others in consciousnessas a percept 
is seized upon and brought to greater clearness by attention. But attention is 
anact of the will. Hence, apperception is an act of volition, a determinative ac-    
tion of the will upon the concepts. The will being an inborn faculty makes ap- 
perception a spontaneous action. He briefly defines apperceptionas conceiving 
activity of the mind, the sum and substance of our intellectual activity. (After- 
Lange’s ‘‘ Apperception.”’) 
19.—RELIGIOUS AND MORAL EDUCATION. 
Netherlands.—At the annual general meeting of elementary teachers, hele this” 
year at Sneek, in Friesland, the president made a reference to the state of pri- 
mary education, as affected by the revision of the school law in 1889. The re- 
vised act provides for State aid to voluntary schools, or, as they are termed in 
Holland, schools with the Bible. At first the gravest fears were entertained by 
all the lovers of enlightenment and progress that the act would be interpreted 
in the narrowest sense, as has been the case with a somewhat similar chaige in 
Belgium. But thus far such apprehensions have proved groundless. The pres- 
ident called the new act one of pacification. It had been honestly and impar- 
tially administered by the government. There were, however, still some de- 
fects to be remedied, the principal of which was the abnormal size of the classes 
in come districts. When one teacher had charge of sixty children, as was too 
frequently the case, all talk of intelligent teaching was mere mockery. (Lond. 
Jl. of Ed.) France.—Several voices are being raised against the nonreligious instruction 
by the public elementary schools. M. Keller, formerly member for Belfort, ad- 
jures the Catholics to come to the rescue, and open schools in opposition to the 
public schools. ‘‘The time is not far off,” he writes, ‘‘when all the public 
schools, like the high public offices, will be in the hands of the fréemasons, and 
when the children will receive an education no longer neutral in its character, 
but downright bad in its tendency.” He advocates schools of a more pro- 
nounced religious character, in which religious instruction shall have the first 
place, and in which all the books, classics, prize books, and recitation, books in- 
cluded, shall bear testimony on every page to God and his wonders. No science 
must be taught that is not illustrated from a religious point of view. Statistics, 
however, do not give such a desponding account of voluntary schools. In 1878 
there were 8,110; in the following year 12,426, and at present there are about 
13,000 Catholic voluntary schools. (Schoolmaster.) 
At the instanes of M. Causeret, a school inspector at Poitiers, the prefect of 
the district has lent his sanction to a plan for encouraging the moral development 
of children by establishing permanent records in the schools of notahle acts of 
courage or devotion performed by pupils of the school. The proposal is univer- 
sally approved. One teacher enlarges on the desire for praise existing among 
children, and considers that the plan will ‘‘inspire the pupils with.the love of 
that which is good,” while another affirms that ‘‘ the best definition of virtue is 
a roll of the virtuous.” The promoter has decided to enlarge the original scope 
of his plan so as to include not only present pupils, but those old pupils who have 
distinguished themselves by obtaining a medal or a diploma of honor forany act 
of courage or devotion. Itis hoped by this means to ‘‘arouse in the children and 
deve'op all those civic virtues which make the strength of armies.” The chil- 
, dren will be stimulated against the time when they are called upon toserve “la 
patric” by the example of those who, upon the battlefield have performed some 
striking deed or who have died for their country. In establishing the record of 
the brave the following order of procedure islaid down: (1) When the inspector 
reports a special act of bravery, the prefect should present a board and a book 
of honor to the school; (2) the young hero’s name is to be written on the board 
and the official record of his deed, after publication in the local official journal, 
ED 90——78.

_ is to be duly inseribed in the beok of honor; (8) the pupils who have secured 
-a medal or diploma for an act of bravery, or whose military service may have 
entitled them to the cross of the Legion of Honor or a medal shall have their 
names inscribed on the board ; (4) the names of old pupils who have perished on 
the battlefield shall be carefully preserved ,and, if possible, engraved on a stone 
~or marble tablet conspicuously placed in the schoolroom. (Lon. J]. of Ed.) 
Germany.—The Prussian minister of education has reversed the decision of a 
pene council and declared that children of parents who profess no religious 
‘aith are not to be compelled to attend scripture lessons in schools, even when 
they receive no religious instruction in gymnastics at home. Moreover, such 
- children are not, to be refused admission to high schools and normal schools. 
20.—SALARIES. 
England.—In England, out of 12,087 head masters, only 357 (less than 3 per 
~ cent) receive salaries of over £300 ($1,500) per year; and of 16,308 head mistresses, 
- only 449 (less than 2.8 per cent) receive over £200 ($1,000). The average salary 
is £134 (about $670) for head masters and £82 ($420) for head mistresses. 
_ + Germany.—A new scale of salaries for teachers of elementary schools in Ger- 
many has been adopted by the city government of Bremen. In the primary 
schools of the city the salary ofa principal will be hereafter from $875. to $1,125; 
that of teachers from $375 to $750; the higher salary mentioned to be reached 
after eighteen years’ service. In the country districts of the city {it must be 
remembered the free city of Bremen, like Hamburg and Lubeck, own a lim- 
ited territory outside of the city limits, analogous to Washington and the Dis- 
triet of Columbia) the salaries of the principals are slightly less than in the 
eity, but those of teachers are the same as those ‘in the city. The principal of 
the normal school in Bremen has $1,500, rising to $1,650 in seven years, the pro- 
fessors begin with $650 and reach $1,125 after twelve years. 
France.—The principals of boys’ primary schools who formerly, that is, before 
the great revival of public education, had only from $500 to $700 annually, now 
have from $820 to $1,060. The principals of girls’ primary, who formerly had 
- from $460 to $710, now have $580 to $910. The male teachers, who had formerly 
had salaries ranging from $340 to $480, have now from $520to$720. The female 
teachers, who had formerly salaries ranging from $340 to $420, now have from 
$380 to $620. The city appropriation for 1889 for current school expenses was 
$4,944,881, while in 1871 it was only $1,920,179; and during the years 1871 and 
1887 the city paid $17,000,000 for the erection and remodeling of school build- 
ings. (Allg. Dr. Latg.) 
Spain.—The library of Madrid has published a general view of the delays in 
the payment of Spanish teachers. A large number have not seen for twenty 
years a third ora half of their salary. More than 25,000 teachers have not re- 
ceived their regular payments. In all, the sum due to teachers amounts to 
3,055,033 pecetas, or considerably over $700,000. A teacher in Benjarin, Gre- 
nada, was owed 2,124 pecetas, but as he could not get any money he took to sell- 
ing matches, while his wife and daughters sought positions as domestics. Many 
- teachers have been obliged to receive public charity. Many have closed their 
schools, not having the strength to continue their werk. A teacher in Torviezon, 
to whom the commune owed 6,000 pecetas, was shut out of the schoolroom be- 
cause the proprietor could not get his rent. While she was able she had paid 
the rent, adding this to the amount due her fromthe Government. The report 
leaves one wondering if all the public spirit in Spain is confined to public school 
teachers. (Freie pid. Blatter..

It must be remembered that these are not. the salaries of teachers of primary 
and grammar schools, but of normal and training schools. In view of that fact, 
Americans are apt to consider these salaries pauper wages. 
In Prussia the average salary in the country. is $256, in the cities $319. To 
these cash salaries should be added 20 per cent for rent and fuel, which are free 
to teachers. They either live in dwellings especially built for the accommoda- 
tion of teachers or in lieu of a dwelling a supplementary payment is: made ; 
- hence the salaries may be said to range between $300 and $370. Principals of * 
  buildings, of course, get more, between $400 and $£00. 
In Sacony the beginning is $190. If the school has more than forty pupils the 
salary is raised pr ogressively to $323. Principals receive a minimum salary 
varying according to the population ; thus in towns with less than 5,000 inhabi- 
tants, $450; in towns of 5 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants, $563; in towns of more than 
10,000 inhabitants, $675. . 
In Wiirtemberg the scale of salaries rises from $225 to $500. 
Hessia gives its teachers in the cities of less than 10,000 inhabitants from $225 
to $450, and in larger cities from $300 to $550. Women get between $225 and 
$450. 
The minimum salary in Bavaria is $200, the maximum $211, according to the 
size of the town. To that is added an annual increase, according to length of 
service, which ends when $300 per annum is reached. 
- In Baden the communities are divided into five classes with reference to salar- 
ies: I, $195; IT, $210; III, $240; IV, $270; V, $300. In large cities higher sal- 
aries are paid. eet

like Hamburg, Frankfiirt, and Berlin, treat the teachers better. The minimum 
in Frankfirt is $430; in Berlin, $390; the maximum in Frankfirt is $850; in — 
Berlin, $810. The rectors or principals in Berlin get from $795 to $971. In 
Frankfurt the principals are all on a level with regard to salaries, they receive 
$1,050. Dresden pays to teachers $484; to principals, $1,200. To all these sums 
about 20 per cent should be added for rent and fuel. 
Basil averages $643; Zurich, $446; Geneva, $438; Neuchatel, $388; Wallis,

the maximum. 
In Russia the average salary is $97 per annum. 
Minimum salary in Portugal i is $113 per annum and an addition for regular at- 
tendance. After the first six years an increase of 25 per cent of the minimum 
salary is given. 
In England, of 15,243 male teachers only 211 had the minimum ceiacene $250. 
The others ranged between $250 and $1,500. Of 22,434 women 1,394 had the. 
minimum of $200. The others ranged. between $200 and $1,000. 
In Scotland and Ireland substantially the same salaries are paid to teachers 
which are paid in England. 
Of course the fact must be considered that the purchasing power of money is — 
greater in Europe than with us, but even with due regard to that a teacher’s 
salary may be said to be low in Europe. (Revue Pedagogique.) ey

  21. SECONDARY SCHOOLS. i 
  Germany—Classical and modern high schools.—The facts presented here are 
gleaned from secondary schools in Prussia only; but the lessons they seem te 
teach are applicable to other states of Germany, though there are fower classical 
and more modern high schools in southern Germany, notable in Wiirtemberg 
and Baden. 
-On February 1, 189), more than 100 classical high schools (secondary schools) 
of Prussia! had in their lowest grades less than 25 pupils each, or an average of 
18. Of these 20 had only an average of 10 pupilsin the ‘‘ sexta” (lowest grade). 
The school in Lauenburg needed a teacher for 6 ‘‘ sextaners,” that in Miinster- 
eifel 1 for 7, those in Hadamar and Rheinbach 1 for 8, those in Gentheim and 
Marue 1 for 9, those in Attendorn, Dramburg, Otterndorf, end Riethburg, and 
other towns 1 for 10 pupils. All thes2 schools are classical high schools or gym- 
nasia, in which the ancient languages claim the lion’s share of time and energy. 
A different picture is presented when we look at the high schools without 
Latin. Where all circumstances are equal, that is to say, where the number of 
inhabitants and the industrial, professional, artistic, and commercial pursuits of 
the people are about equal, we find that the classical school has an almost empty 
“sexta,” while that of the modern school without Latin is overcrowded. 
A comparison of a few cities may prove this. Take, for example, the high 
schools of Liidenscheid and Bockenheim. In these cities of equal size and sim- 
ilar conditions of life, we find that Lidenscheid, with 15,000 inhabitants, has 
only 17 pupils in the lowest grade of its gymnasium, the classical high-school, 
while Bockenheim, with 17,500 inhabitants, does not show the relative number 
20, but 58 pupils in the lowest grade; but then its high school is one without 
Latin. Eyen in cities that have both kinds of schools, the same fact may be 
observed. Emden, for instance, has 20 pupils in the lowest grade of its gym- 
nasium, and 34 in that of the modern school without Latin, which school is 
only a few years old. 
Precisely the same facts are noticed in larger cities, and they prove most con- 
vincingly that though the people turn away from the classical languages, they 
do not mean to desert higher education. Merseburg, for instance, has 16,800 
inhabitants, but only 23 pupils in the lowest grade of its classical high school. 
But annually 190 boys in that city reach the age of nine years, hence might 
enter the high school (the course of which covers the years from nine to eighteen), 
- but 167 of them do not. It is reasonable to suppose thatmany of them would do 
so ifa higher school without Latin was founded. Compare this with Emden. 
This city has only 14,000 inhabitants, but 56 pupils in the lowest grade of its 
high school without Latin, or about one-third of the boys of that age in that 
one year. 
_ Here is another instance: Memel has 18,800 inhabitants and only 23 pupils in _ 
“sexta” of the high school, which is a classical one. How many of stich pupils 
it might have may be seen from Graidenz, which has 17,300 inhabitants but 113 
pupils in the lowest grade of its high school without Latin. Gérlitz has 55,600 
inhabitants and only one high school, a classical one. It has 55 ‘‘sextaners,” 
while Potsdam, with 51,000 inhabitants and a modern high school, has 175 ‘‘sex- 
taners.” E 
How little the gymnasia answer the demands of modern life is seen from the 
way the people are deserting them. The gymnasium at Memel had in 1882 49, 
in 1890 it has 23; that at Friedberg had in 1882 35,in 1890 it has 18; that at 
Gumbinnen had in 1882 40, in 1890 it has 17; that at Havelberg had in 1882 46, 
in 1890 it has 19; that at Marne had in 1882 25, in 1890 it has 9: that at Oldesloe 
had in 1882 30, in 1890 it has 16 pupils in the lowest grade. Since the number 
of inhabitants of these towns has not decreased, but, on the contrary, increased 
during the eight years mentioned, it is plain that the cause is to be sought in 
the schools and the trend of the time. ‘‘If these towns had high schools 
without Latin more boys would aspire toa higher education,” says the Zeitung 
fiir das Héhere Unterrichtswesen. ‘‘ Despite the facts set forth, the Govern- 
ment of Prussia aids the establishment of new classical high schools and dis- 
courages that of modern schools. This is seen from the fact that during the 
school year 1889-’90 eleven new classical schools have been opened and only one 
modern high school with Latin.” (Ztg. f. d. héh. Unterrichtswesen.) 
England.— We think that the time has come when the state might usefully 
take some degree of responsibility for the entire educational system of the coun- 
try. What the degree should be will necessarily be a matter for discussion   
1Prussia has about 300 classical high schools gymnasia.

whenever action is taken; but we entirely fail to see why only one class of 
schools should have the advantage of Government examination and encourage- 
ment. ‘There isno reason to doubt that most of the secondary schools of the 
country are doing excellent work ; but there are also some which might do far 
better work than they are now doing, and many which provide an education but 
ill-fitted for the necessities of the day. In addition to this, education in the 
middle and higher class schools is terribly expensive, and we do not at all see 
why one section of the community should have free education provided fortheir 
children while all the other sections, which find most of the money, get no bene- 
fit whatever. Our present educational system is entirely a class system. It 
benefits one class only ; but it is easy to see that there are great numbers of peo- 
ple, such as professional men, tradesmen, farmers, and persons of small inde- 
pendent means, who want help in the education of their children much more 
than the well-paid artisan or mechanic. The classes we havenamed findalarge 
portion of the money now spent upon elementary schools, which are of no useto 
them, and paying so heavily as they do for the benefit of other people, they are 
entitled to ask for a little advantage to themselves. We may rely upon it also 
that they will be certain to get an advantage if they ask for it with sufficient 
persistency.” (Nott. Daily Guardian.) am 
France.—M. Dupuy, in his financial report to the chamber on public instruc- 
tion (France), set forth as follows the chief causes of the decline of colleges and 
lyeées: (1) The increase in the cost of board and teaching; (2) the incessant 
change of text-books, and the expenses thereby imposed upon parents; (3) the 
constant change in the programmes and the method of teaching; (4) the gen- 
eral state of instability in th se institutions, which causes discouragementamong 
the teachers. But to these causes must be added another not mentioned in the 
report, namely, a growing dislike of the French parent for the whole system of 
barrack-like education in the secondary schools of France. oe 
Germany.—In the Kingdom of Prussia the classical high schools (¢ymnasia) are 
so well patronized that there is one student of a classical high school to every 
384 inhabitants of the entire population. How greatly favored these schoolsare 
generally may be seen from the following list of cities in which the ratio of 
population is less than 100: Kiel has 1 student to every 99 inhabitants; Halber- 
stadt, 1 to 81; Munster, 1 to 63; Treves, 1 to 62; Stolp, 1 to 60; Hildesheim, 1 
to 58; Tilsit, 1 to 55; Ratibor, 1 to 47; Murbury, 1 to 40; Padeborn, 1 to 29; 
Freienwalde,.1 to 27; Ostrowo, 1 to 24; Marienwerder, 1 to 21. The number of 
university students has increased in entire Germany from 17,631 in 1869 to 34,-~ 
118 in 1888. While the ratio of increase in the population during the same period 
was pale 20 per cent, that of the number of students was 100 per cent. (Paed. 
Ztg. 
The Berlin city council sympathizes in the feeling against the abolition of the 
realgymnasium, and has presented a petition on the subject. They point out 
that the 11 gymnasia in Berlin were attended by 5,569 pupils in December, 1890, 
the 7 realgymnasium by 3,951. Consequently, the realgymnasium has on an 
average 58 pupils more thanagymnasium. This number is all the more remark- 
able when all the attractions and privileges of the gymnasium are taken into 
consideration. Again, the decrease in numbers in the year was in the gymna- 
sium 219, and in the realgymnasium only 26. (This decrease is probably due to 
the erection of higher Burgerschulen.) Finally, it seems very probable that 
when the realgymnasium is abolished the gymnasium will be considered the more 
aristocratic school,and thatthe great social danger ofsharply defined class schools 
will arise. The petition closes with thisrequest: ‘‘'To preserve the*realgymna- 
sium, and give the graduates the right to study medicine.” (Allg. D. Lztg.) 
The mayor of Brandenburg, Herr Reuscher, has sent to the magistrates of all ~ 
the 280 towns in Prussia in which only one high school exists a document in 
which he calls their attention to the resolutions arrived at by the school confer- 
ence in Berlin of December last, and to urge upon them to join in a petition on 
the subject to the Emperor. ‘‘In the towns,” he writes, ‘‘ where the realgym- 
nasia is called in question by the sweeping decision of the conference the city 
authorities have already taken steps to prevent an utter annihilation of these 
institutions. -The numerous Prussian towns, numbering almost 300, which have 
only one high school have urgent need of understanding the import of the con- 
ference resolutions and of averting the danger which threatens their interests 
in the immediate future. Not only is the existence of the nine-class realgym- 
nasia, the seven-class progymnasia, and prorealgymnasia threatened in these 
towns, but also the three upper classes are concerned, in which the number of 
the pupils ‘‘does not justify their existence.” This, naturally enough, is very

     EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90.” 
often the case insmall communities. In order to attain this end a petition has 
been drawn up demanding the introduction of a common six-class lower school 
for all kinds of schools, thus directly opposing the resolutions arrived at last 
December by the school reform conference. (Allg. D. Lztg.) 
During the summer of 1889 the gymnasia (classical high schools) in the Prussian 
province of Silesia had 51 per cent Protestants, 34. per cent Catholics, 0.2 per cent 
other Christians, and 14.8 per cent Israelite pupils. The realgymnasia(modern 
high schools) had 64.4 per cent Protestant, 22.7 per cent Catholic, 0.2 per cent 
other Christians, and 12.7 per cent Israelite pupils. In the citizens’ schools 
(middle schools without Latin) the number of Protestants was 71 per cent, that 
of the Catholics 13.6 per cent, that of other Christians 0.7 per cent, and that of 
Israelites 14.7 per cent. Or, taking all these high schools together, the number 
of Protestants was 56.5 per cent, that of the Catholics 22.8 per cent, that of other 
Christians 0.2 per cent, and that of Israclites 14.5 per cent. (Allg. D. Latg.) 
In Germany parents are obliged to determine early whether their sons are to 
_ pursue higher studies or whether they are to limit their education to the ele- 
- mentary branches, for the high school has its own ‘‘feeder’’ (elementary classes), 
and rarely takes its pupils from the public elementary school. Moreover, the 
parents must determine before the boys have reached their eleventh year 
whether they are to pursue a course which will land them at the gate of the 
university or of a polytechnical or other professional school. Once fairly 
started in their career, there is no return possible, extept at the sacrifice of 
some years which they must waste in order to ‘‘adjust themselves” to the dif- 
ferent conditions, should they or their parents determine upon a change. .- 
This inflexibility isthe reason why in Germany so many ‘‘miss their natural 
‘ealling.” It is the effect of conditions arising from the differentiation in 
society. An aristocracy of birth, education, or wealth seems a necessity as 
long as a monarchical form of government is maintained. A monarch must 
needs have a pedestal, which is found in an ascending scale of society. Hence 
there is in Europe no such exponent of modern civilization as our common 
school, which is the most powerful leveler of social inequalities yet devised. 
While it lifts the lower strata of society, it also drags downward those standing 
on an elevation; and it is quite immaterial whether this elevation be a money 
bag, or a pedestal of culture, or agenealogical tree. (Z. R. K. in the Teacher.) 
Dr. Viereck, of Berlin, maintains that the educated proletariat is due to the 
excessive priviloges granted to the gymnasiums. He says; ‘‘ The Conclusion is 
irresistible that the root of the evil is to be found in our scholastic system, which 
treats the secondary school merely as a step in preparation for the university. 
- The development of political and commercial conditions has had an unmistaka-~ 
ble influence in greatly increasing the number of students preparing for a pro- 
fessional career. The force of competition has brought about a more efficient 
mental training among men of business; for those possessing it are able to suc- 
ceed where those without it fail. All these influences have worked together to 
send more students than ever before to the secondary’schools. And here lies 
the difficulty. The students, asa rule, donotselect the kind of secondary schools 
best suited to their wants, but the gymnasium, because of the marked privileges 
- conferred by law upon its graduates. As a result every profession is over- 
crowded, and thousands of highly educated young men are unable to earn a de- 
cent living. 
It has finally been decided that the graduates of the Oberrealschulen of 
Prussia are to be admitted to the university study of mathematics, natural sci- 
ence, architecture, engineering, mining, and forestry, with the prospect of ob- 
taining posts as teachers. Moreover, they are qualified as candidates for posts 
in the telegraph and postal service and naval architecture and machinery. 
Realgymnasia receive the same privileges. The final certificate from the Biir- 
gerschulen will qualify for admission into all civil-service posts, instead of only 
for the lower legal posts. The right to the one-year military service will be so 
arranged that for the pupils of the nine-year as well as for the seven-year insti- 
tutions the privilege is discontinued of obtaining the right through mere pro- 
motion into the Obersecunda without examination. In the future an examina- 
tion conducted by a commissioner of the government will be held at the end of a 
six years’ course, and the certificate for the one year’s service will depend on 
this examination. (Lond. Ed. Times). ' 
SECULAR SUNDAY SCHOOLS. 
Gerniany.—Sunday schools (nonreligious) are found all over Germany (notably 
in Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, and Wiirtemburg), Austria, and Switzerland. Their 
_ purpose is either (1) to give pupils who have left the elementary school an ad- 
         
 
-P-A-G-E-647
         FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 1239 
vanced grade of elementary instruction; also, in certain cases, to mend that 
which was neglected by absence from day schools, in cases of sickness, or other- 
wise; or (2) to offer technical instruction ad hoc; that is, for special purposes, 
such as preparation for trades, agricultural, horticultural, and commercial pur- 
suits, domestic economy (for girls). The character of these schools varies in ac- 
cordance with the varying industrial and economic conditions of the towns. 
While in the Erzgebirge, in Saxony, straw-weaving and metal work are taught, 
in Switzerland it is clockmaking and designing, while in Dresden and Leipsie, 
again, schools of languages for hotel waiters, and in Berlin commercial Sunday 
schools are established. ‘ iS 
Both kindsof schools are called ‘‘ fortbildungs-schulen” (continuation schools), 
really postgraduate courses of the ‘‘ volks-schule They are partly evening 
schools, partly Sunday schools. The statistical sources at hand fail to show how 
many of these schools are open on Sunday. Bits of information, however, may 
be welcome. : 
Py —The Handwerker-Schule in Berlin had 16 Sunday classes in 1884. 
The industrial art schools (schools of design) in Rhenish Prussia and other — 
provinces are all open on Sunday from 8 a. m. till noon, as I know from personal 
Inspection. Gewerbe-museums (museums of industrial art). Also fine art mu- - 
seums are open on Sunday. a 
Saxony.—This is the only country from which exact, though meager, dataare 
at hand, to wit: Trade schools open on Sunday, 13 out of .65. Those not open 
on Sunday for regular instruction have occasional lectures on Sunday. Techni- 
cal continuation schools open on Sunday, 22 out of 28. Agricultural schools . 
ditto, 2 out of 9. Commercial schools ditto, 1 out of 32. Many private Sunday 
schools not accounted for. While these may not be considered formidable num- 
bers, it must be understood that the elementary continuation schools (postgradu- 
ate courses) are not enumerated because they belong to the regular day-school 
system and have the same teachers who teach in day schools. 
» Austria—(Cisleithania) had in 1889 122,968 pupils and 8,678 teachers in tech- 
nical, trade, professional, and other special schools, but the official reports fail 
to state which are open.on Sunday. Asa matter of fact I know that many util- 
ize the Sunday morning either for regular instruction or for lectures. 
Wiritemberg.—The 173 continuation schools in Wiirttemberg had in 1890 12,- 
271 pupils in arithmetic, 8,459 pupils in language and composition, 2,935 pupils ~ 
in bookkeeping, 2,921 pupils in calligraphy, 10,705 pupils in freehand drawing, 
4,531 pupils in geometrical drawing, 6,346 pupils in technical drawing ; namely, 
1,627 woodwork, 857 metal work, 3,410 various trades, 326 industrial art, 126 let- 
tering. A great number of these are apprentices and study on Sunday. The 
city of Stuttgart alone has a Sunday technical school, with 27 teachers and 334 
pupils (1890). 
Tungary.—(Transleithania) had in 1889 62,220 pupils and 2,449 teachers in 
similar schools. Same remark regarding Sunday. 
Switzerland.+Here the continuation schools and courses are attended by 34,- 
817 pupils, partly regular Army recruits. Time not stated, but it is will known 
in Europe that Switzerland isfamous for its secular Sunday schools, being a poor 
country. * < 
ince most of the technical and elementary continuation schools (both evening — 
and Sunday schools) are supported by societies, trades unions, and only rarely 
subsidized by the state, centralized official statements as to their attendance and 
course of study are wanting. (L. R. K.) 
          
23.—SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Switzerland.—The Royal University at Geneva is to open a school for practical 
training of travelers, giving instruction in geography, geology, botany, geodesy, 
and other subjects required to fit them to make scientific observations and in- 
telligently form collections of natural objects in distant lands. Similar work ~ 
was undertaken some years ago by the Royal Geographical Society of London 
and the Berlin Geographical Society, and arrangements are also provided in 
Paris for giving such instruction. 3 
Germany.—A number of the professors in the technical universities in Prussia 
have published a counter declaration to the one issued on December 1, 1890, that 
the course of study in a gymnasium or classical high school was not a fitting 
preparation for the studies of a technical university. The supporters of the 
counter declaration are of the opinion that the Realschulen do not fit the pupils 
any better than the gymnasia for the technical schools, and that when certain

defects are removed both kinds of schools will be on a level. Among the sup- 
.porters of this declaration are Profs. Muller, Jurgens, Damert, and Liders, in 
‘Aachen; Jacobsthal, Dobbert, Schifer, Hauck, and Wintergarten, in Berlin; 
Hase, Kohler, Stier, and Backhausen, in Hanover. 
Industrial Schools in Europe.—In almost all of the manufacturing towns of 
Europe during the last half century schools have been opened for apprentices 
in the industrial arts. In Russia there are no less than 1,20) of these schools 
with 20,000 pupils. Among justly celebrated preparatory schools are found the 
Ambats school at Amsterdam, the technical school of Birmingham, Heriot’s 
Hospital of Edinburg, and the St. Luc schools of Belgium. All agree that in- 
dustrial education can only be really given in a workshop where teachers will 
be able to instruct pupils by means of practical demonstration and by sketches 
of design. At Birmingham and Edinburg pupils are admitted to technical 
schools, which are considered merely as a sort of primary industrial school, 
where very fine chemical and physical laboratories are at their disposal and in 
which they acquire a certain practice in preparation for industrial work. The 
general result is that at the end of their studies the pupils are engaged by in- 
dustrial superintendents as future apprentices. 
Tn Ireland there is another kind of preparatory schools, to which are admitted 
only children who have lost both parents, and who are destined for domestic or 
rural professions. They here receive primary instruction, some knowledge of 
science and of art, and a sufficiently complete manual training. These institu- 
tions combine the two characters of schools and asylums. Beside the primary 
schools there is a superior kind called industrial and technical. These exist for 
the, object of giving to apprentices and workmen some knowledge of science and 
art, which will increase the financial value of their work. This is the complete 
theory and practice of the industrial workshop. Belgium has founded 36 indus- 
trial schools, in which are given every evening and on Sundays the elements 
of a scientific and artistic knowledge corresponding to the profession of those 
who frequent them. The number attending exceeds 25,000. 
In both England and Belgium the number of pupils in proportion to the 
opulation is about the same; that is, 4.2 for each 1,000. But instruction in the 
Tited Kingdom is better than anywhere else; it has a more scientific and 
practical character on account of the well-equipped laboratories and work- 
shops, which are placed at the disposition of the pupils. In Holland there are _ 
32 industrial schools and 25 professional schools, attended by about 7,000 pupils. 
The proportion of these is about 2 to every 1,000; but Holland, so cut up by 
canals, and with the sea continually breaking bounds, is rather a maritime 
‘than a manufacturing nation, so that there is nothing surprising in this pro- 
portion as compared with that of Belgium. Switzerland has no less than 87 
schools, giving to apprentices and workmen professional instruction. The 
pupils number 8,000. There are others said to be highly developed, where 
drawing is a branch of instruction. Thus, in one of the poorest cantons, that of 
Appenzell, institutions of that class are met in every community, and the attend- 
ance is as obligatory as the snows will permit. The industrial population of the 
cantons is 200,000 persons in a total of 2,846,000 inhabitants, and this balances 
that of Belgium, where metallurgic and other manufactures are carried to a 
high point of development. $ 
In Denmark, a country of 2,096,467 inhabitants, there are 77 schools for pro- 
fessional instruction of workmen with more than 6,000 pupils. The technical 
school of Copenhagen alone numbers no less than 2,000. In Sweden there are 
28 industrial schools; that of Stockholm has 800 pupils, more than one-half per 
cent of the population of the town. Italy, which in 1885 had 136 industrial and 
art schools, with 16,274 pupils, has since then made great progress; but she is 
suffering, as England sometimes suffers, from an excess of manufactured articles, 
and these must be disposed of at any price in order to avoid a ruinous embar- 
rassment. The school at Hamburg, under the direction of Marius Vachon, is 
the best institution in Germany, both on account of the principles which’ in- 
spired its creation and the methods of instruction. In entering there, if the 
pupil is neither an apprentice nor workman he must choose a trade; these two 
classes of pupils constitute the principal number of the school population. 
A law of the Hamburg senate imposes on all industrial superintendents the 
duty of sending their apprentices to this school for six hours every week. They 
are thus enabled to attend during three, four, or even five years, according to 
their disposition and abilities. The first part of the first year is exclusively de- 
voted to the study of the primary elements of drawing. All drawings must be 
made from nature. After that comes instruction from professional designs. As
-P-A-G-E-649
  ; ‘FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL NOTES. 1241 
soon as the pupil can sketch he is given as models the tiene which belong to 
his trade. In succeeding years professional drawing goes hand in hand with 
artistic instruction. Each pupil receives instruction, personal, varied, and 
rapid according to his temperament and tastes. The discipline i is very Severe, 
so that a pupil b2comes accustomed to conduct himself as a serious man and to 
consider work as a social duty. The Hamburg school has served as a model to 
the schools of design in various parts of Europe. (English Educational Press.) 
The Prussian Government has recently, more than in former years, bestowed 
much attention upon the promotion of so-called continuation schools (post-grad- 
uate courses of the elementary schools), as well as trade and technical schools. 
This is plainly seen from the increase in the sums annually appropriated for © 
these institutions. In the state budget of 1885-85 the sum of $142,266 was des- 
ignated to support these institutions, which in, the nature of the case are directly 
benefiting the working. In 1890-91 the appropriation rose to $431,716, and in 
1891-92 to $145,274. The Government makes the announcement that it is not 
sat fied with the system of industrial schools as it now exists, but wishes tosee 
it extended ovr most of the various trades and occupations found at industrial 
centers. Especially the continuation courses will find encouragement. Through ~ 
these the Government can reach a much greater number of pupils than through 
special technical schools. Naturally the latter will he able to offer a higher 
grade of technical education, and in due time there will, side by side with cle- 
mentary or people’s schools, spring up atconvenient centers asystem of elemen- 
tary technical ov trade schoals, that will feed the secondary technical schools. 
The Government intends to establish new elementary architectural schools, 
devoted to the building trades—one in Kénigsberg; one in Silesia, and one in 
Brandenburg. The city of Cottbus is negotiating with the royal government : 
to have one of these institutions located within its precincts. “The bureau of 
technical instruction in the department of public works is of the opinion that 
to open schools for the training of foremen, and technical schools for the pro- 
motion of shipbuilding in Danzig , Stettin, ‘Berlin, Hannover, and Altona, will 
prove of incalculable benefit to tho nation.’ The Rhenish- - Westphalian mining 
school it is contempleted to remove from Bochum to Duisburg, with branches 
and ‘‘feeders” in the coal districts on the Ruhr-River. Gleiwitz, in Silesia, an- 
other mining district also, is to have a new mining school. The oxistin weav- 
ing school of Crefeld and Berlin are to be enlarged, and new schools, with 
courses for the training of foremen and experts for the cloth and buckskin 
manufactory, are in process of erection in Sommerfeld, Forst, and Finterwalde, 
and other centers of the clothindustry. Malhausen, in Thurengia, and Bleich- 
rode, near Nordhaus2n, are each to have an elementary weaving school. The 
neg gotiations with the city of Bunzlau, with a view toward the establishment of 
a ceramic technical school, have been ‘yeopened. For the training of engineers 
and machinists on ocean steamers schools are to be opened in Stettin and Bre- 
men. In Schmalkalden a school for the preparation of foremen in the so- -called 
variety ironworks is to be established. This institution will have extensive 
shaps for a great number of apprentices. 
Schools of ‘design and industrial art the Government intends to establish in all. 
cities of 33,0°0 or more inhabitants. Where one is in existence others are to be 
added. Prussia has, according to the last census, 49 of such cities. Of thes2 
the following have each a flourishing school of design and industrial art: Aix- 
            
  la-Chapelle, Cassel, Dusseldorf, Halle, Magdeburg, “Hannover, Frankfort, and 
Berlin. Berlin needs another without delay. But Danzig, E Ibing, Bromberg, 
and Posen have made no claim for such schools. They lean rather toward agri- 
cultural and forestry schools. The plansso far determined upon contain 18 new 
schools within the next six years; others are to be extended. Institutions which 
have been called into existence by the enterprise of the local authorities are well - 
subsidized by the state and enlarged to meet the growing demands of the times. 
The stat» authorities direct in every case where a subsidy is granted that the 
teachers’ salaries be increased and new talent be drawn intothe schools. When- 
ever the funds allow, these technical schools are made state institutions. The 
entire state subsidies for the establishment of new and extension of existing 
technical and trade schcols are estimated at 1,078,000 marks ($269,500); this sum 
is not included in the annual current expenses mentioned in the beginning of 
this article. 
The administration of continuation schools (post-graduate course of elementary 
schools), so far es they are technical or trade schools, will be turned over to the 
minister of agriculture, since most of these schools are situated in rural dis- 
tricts, and it is the intention toenlist the iaierogy of agricultural people in these 
schools,

Tho recently submitted bill regulating trades (especially 2120) is thought to be 
the best incentive to trade schools, and it would seem that the state, by promot- 
ing such schools, is obeying tendencjes which may drive itfurther and further i 
toward socialism as advocated by Marx. As soon as the bill becomes a law, the 
annual appropriations for technical schools will need to be increased to meet the 
requirements of the law. From all this it is plain that Prussia if following the 
illustrious example of the Kingdom of Saxony in preparing a great number of 
_ thinking artisans, foremen, designers, masterworkmen} and inventors, in order 
not to fall behind in the race with other nations, notably with France, in in- 
- dustrial and wealth producing pursuits. (Engl. Educ. Press.) 
24.—SUPERIOR INSTITUTIONS. 
+ Germany.—The number of students in the polytechnicums of the German Em- 
_ pire, in the winter term of 1890-91, was 3,567 as against 3,372 in the previous 
- year; the number of nonmatriculated students, 1,273 as against 1,106; and the 
“number of casual attendants at single courses of lectures, 522 as against 343 ; on 
- the whole, then, 5,362 as against 4,821 attendants at lectures. Of these Aachen 
numbers, 197; Berlin, 1,640; Brunswick, 273; Darmstadt, 316; Dresden, 480; Han- 
over, 580; Karlsruhe, 585; Munich, 882 ; Stuttgart, 486. 
- Hessia.—The Hessian Government has laid a bill before the Landtag for the 
erection of magnificen tnew building, for the polytechnicum in Darmstadt. The 
cost amounts to $3,912,500. The town has offered to pay $3,000,000, and the Goy- 
ernment will supply the rest. The Grand Duke has consented to the appropria- 
tion of a part of the palace grounds for the erection of the new buildings. 
~ France.—The French minister of public instruction has issued a circular in 
accordance with which young men and women who are preparing for the pro- 
- fession of teachers, and for diplomas generally, are to go through a solid course 
of ‘sound French literature of the nineteenth century stamp.” ‘This means,” 
says a Paris correspondent, ‘‘ that they are to give up the old classical authors 
from Montaigne to Chateaubriand, and to devote their attention in preference 
to Thiers, Michelet, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Musset.” 
- Saxony.—The theological faculty of the University of Leipzig, Germany, have, 
' by desire of the minister of education, posted a notice on the university notice 
board, calling on the students of theology to attend lectures on pedagogy more 
regularly than they have hitherto done, and also not to neglect the practical 
side of their training. ‘‘A more thorough study of pedagogy and satisiactory 
“practical training is more necessary to theo!ogians now than it cver was.”

with 78,001 pupils; and 154 infant schools, with 24,354 pupils. There are 76 pub- 
lic primary schools for the natives, with 8,963 pupils (910 girls). Of the total 
children of school age (6 to 13) 611,720 receive no instruction; of these 585,389 
were Musselmen. oe 
25.—TEACHERS. 
Prussia.—The proportion of female to male teachers in Prussia is very small, 
Of the 68,765 elementary teachers only 7,869 or 11 per cent are female teachers. 
In the private middle schools (private lower schools are very rare) 2,626 of — 
the 3,459 teachers are women. Protestant Germany seems to have a much 
greater dislike to intrust women with teaching than Catholic Germany. In the 
whole of Prussia there are only 442 female teachers in the Protestant village 
schools, whereas over the same area there are 2,304 women teaching in Catholic — 
schools. (Lond. Jl. of Ed.) 
Berlin has at present in its public elementary schools 3,200 teachers, 2,182 men 
and 1,018 women. Of the men, 96.38 per cent had gone through a course of nor- 
mal school training, 2.29 per cent were university graduates, and 1.33 per cent 
had prepared themselves privately and then passed the required examination. 
Three of the normal school graduates had afterward acquired a university edu- 
cation. Only 537 of these teachers were, graduates of the normal school in Ber- 
lin, 1,640 came from other parts of the Kingdom of Prussia and 5 from other Ger- 
man states. Of the 1,018 women 883 were prepared professionally in Berlin, 
while 135 came from other parts of the kingdom. (Paed. Ztg.) 
England.—Mr. Grasby, the E 
amined the American school system, says of American teachers: “ The special 
feature of the English teacher is technical skill in practical teaching; that of 
the American, an educated and cultured mind. The time one has spent in 
teaching or learning to teach the other has spent in study. The one has all 
along been subject to the influence of a narrowing occupation, and now oftentimes 
considers himself well-nigh perfect in his art; the other has been under the in- 
fluences of a liberal training, is well versed in the principles of education, has” 
had little practice in teaching; but is fully conscious of the fact, and therefore, 
ready to take advantage of every means tocompensate for hislack. A conscious   
    glish educator who recently so thoroughly ex- ; 
ignorance is often better than a self-satisfied knowledge. The average Ameri- = 
can teacher maintains better discipline with less force; is a superior educator, 
but less an adept than her English compeer in filling the pupil's head with facts.”

    CHAPTER XVII. 
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
REPORT OF THE GENERAL AGENT FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, ALASKA DIVISION, 
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1890. 
Sir: In compliance with the rules and regulations for the conduct of schools 
and education in Alaska, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, April 9, 
1890, I have the honor of submitting the following, as the annual report of th3 
general agent of education for the year ending June 30, 1890: 
A.—NUMBER AND GENERAL CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS IN ALASKA. 
Alaska has 15 day schools, supported wholly by the Government, with a total 
enrollment of 1,110 pupils; 9 contract schools, containing 302 pupils, which are 
supported jointly by the Government and the missionary societies; 10 mission 
schools, with an enrollment of 297 pupils, which are supported wholly from the 
funds of the churches, and two schools sustained on the Seal Islands by the 
North American Commercial Company, under contract with the Treasury De- 
partment, and containing 79 pupils, making a total of 37 schools and 1,788 pupils. 
  I.—PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
1,—UNALASKA DISTRICT. 
Unalaska (John A. Tuck; teacher).—Enrollment, 30; population largely 
Aleuts. 
Prof. Tuck reached Unalaska in September, 1889, and renting a house from 
the Alaska Commercial Company, opened school with an average attendance of 6 
pupils. In the absence of any school building, one end of his residence was fitted 
up as aschoolroom. So much interest was developed in the schoolthat the pu- 
pils, with but few exceptions, continued at school during the Russo-Greek Church 
festivals, which are very numerous. Among the pupils were the grown-up 
daughters of the Russian priest. : 
Prof. Tuck reports that the rate of progress was almost all that could be de- 
sired. 
With the opening of the next school year it is expected that the ladies of the 
National Home Mission Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church will enter 
into an agreement with the United States Bureau of Education to take charge 
of the school, several thousands of dollars having already been raised for that 
urpose. ‘ 
The building they propose to erect will be knownas the ‘‘ Jesse Lee Memorial 
Home.” 
Unga (John H. Carr, teacher).—Enrollment, 24; population, Russian and 
Aleut. 
Gratifying progress was made in the usual school studies and in temperance 
hygiene by those who were regular in their attendance. : 
The teacher pleads earnestly for some rule tosecure more regular attendance. 
The ladies of the National Home Mission Society of the Methodist Episcopal 
Church have purchased and shipped to Unga the materials for a teachers’ resi- 
dence, to be known as the ‘‘Martha Ellen Stevens Cottage.”

  1246 -- EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
2.—KADIAK DISTRICT. 
Kadiak (W. E. Roscoe, teacher).—Enrollment, 67 ; population, Russian. 
At the solicitation of the parents, Mr. Roscoe commenced his school a week 
in advance of the regular time of opening. The progress of the pupils proved 
very satisfactory, and the attendance fairly so. 
Much inconvenience resulted from the number of holidays of the Russo-Greek 
Church. These are more than 200 during the year, and they greatly interfere 
with the regular attendance of the pupils. 
During the year the Government erected a comfortable school building, which 
was greatly needed. 
Ajognak (John Duff, teacher).—Enrollment, 38; population, Russian and Hs- 
kimo. fs 
The Rev. James A. Wirth, who had taught the school from the beginning 
and was greatly beloved by parents and pupils alike, resigned on account of the 
_ health of his wife. His resignation was received so late in the season that there 
was no time to procure a teacher from che states, and Mr. John Duff, who was 
- already in that region, was appointed. 
School was resumed on the 2d of October with 16 pupils, the attendance in- 
creasing to 24 during the first week. 
From the first many of the parents took an interest in the school and searcely 
a day passed that one or more were not visitors. 
Geographical exercises on the map were an unfailing source of interest; pu- 
ils that did not know half of their ietters could point out the States ot the 
nited States and give their names correctly. 
The ordinary school books speak of so many things that neither the children 
nor their parents have ever seen that it is difficult for them to understand what 
they are reading about. To remedy this somewhat Mr. Duff proposes to form 
@ museum of common things in connection with the school and thus give the 
pupils object lessons in connection with their books. _ 
An interesting feature of the year was the attendance of a number of children 
_ from outside villages. 
The school has suffered greatly from intemperange, many of the children being 
on the verge of starvation because the parents had traded off the living of the 
family for liquor. 
Frequently, in visiting his pupils, the teacher found them hungry and shiver- 
ing in the corner of the room, and both the parents dead drunk. 
A comfortable school building and teacher’s residence were erected by the 
Government during the year. 
Karluk.—A good | school building and teacher's residence were erected during 
the year at this important point, and a school will be opened at the beginning 
of the next school year. 
The number of villages of civilized Russians in this district requires many 
“more schools than can be established with the amount appropriated by Congress 
_for this purpose. 
Professor Duff, of Afognak, estimates that there should be at least twenty ad- 
ditional schools in the Kadiak district. 
3.—SrrkA DISTRIict. 
Sitka, No. 1 (Miss Ann D. Beatty, teacher).—Enrollment, 68, or one more than 
the total number of white children of school age in the village ; population, 
American and Russian. Among the pupils of this school are the children of the 
civil and naval officials who are stationed at the capital of the Territory. 
Sitka, No. 2 (Miss Gertrude Patton, teacher).—Enroliment, 83; pupils, native 
Thlingets. 
With 280 native children between 5 and 17 years of age in the village, there 
ought to be some way of securing alarger attendance than 83. A simple oblig- 
atory attendance law would work a great improvement in school attendance 
among the native population. 
Juneau, No. 1 (Miss Rhoda A. Lee, teacher).—Enrollment, 33; pupils, Ameri- 
cans. 
This is one of the most advanced schools in the Territory. Year by year the 
public sentiment of Juneau is improving. More families are moving in, and the 
white school reaps the benefit of this growth. 
Juneau, No. 2 (Miss Cassia Patton, teacher).—Enrollment, 51; pupils, natives. 
The best portion of this school and the pupils that made the most rapid and 
gratifying progress in their studies were those that came from the Model Home,

conducted by Rev. and Mrs. E. S. Willard and their assistants, Miss E. Mat- 
thews and Miss Jennie Dunbar, of the Presbyterian Mission. 
Douglas City, No. 1 (Mrs. W. S. Adams, teacher).—Enrollment, 50; pupils, 
Americans. 
During the year a comfortable school building was erected by the Govern- 
ment, Owing to delay in its completion the echool was not opened until the 
Ist of February, 1890. The opening of this new schoolroom for the whites al- 
layed the friction of last year, when the children of the whites and natives were. 
compelled to use the same room or not go to school at all. 
Mrs. Adams reports that her advanced pupils, in addition to their ordinary 
studies, have taken up natural history, botany, and simple lessons in mental- 
science. t 
Douglas City, No. 2(C. H. Edwards, teacher).—Enrollment, 92 ; pupils, native. 
Douglas Island being the principal center of the mining interests, many na- 
tives come from distant villages to secure work for a longer or shorter period. 
They are constantly coming and going. : 
This creates great irregularity in the attendance of the children and greatly 
increases the work of the teacher. : 
Killisnoo (Miss May Ransom, teacher}.—Enrollment, 32; pupils, Russiansand- 
natives. 
Wrangell (Mrs. Lyda McA. Thomas, teacher).—Enrollment, 84; pupils, natives. 
During the year the chief of the village acted as special policeman to look after 
all truants from school. The result was good, securing greater regularity in the 
attendance and more rapid advancement in their studies. $ 
Klawack (Mr. Henry C. Wilson, teacher).—Enrollment, 66 ; pupils, natives. 
After the resignation of Mrs. Currie, in the summer of 1889, no teacher was 
secured until the following spring, when Mr. Wilson reopened the school on the £2 
1st of May, 1890. e 
Jackson (Miss Clara A. Gould, teacher).—Enroliment, 87; pupils, natives. Dur- 
ing the winter a number of parents moved into the village for the purpose of 
placing their children in school. 
Meilakahtla (William Duncan, teacher).—Enrollment, 179; pupils, natives. a 
This school is of more than ordinary interest from the fact that this settle- ¥ 
ment is composed of Tsimpseans, who, a few years ago, eameoverin a body from 
British Columbia to Alaska in order to secure greater religious and political 
freedom. 
Mr. Ivan Petroff, special agent for Alaska of the Eleventh United States 
Census, in his report to the Census Bureau, commenting upon the school attend- 
ance of the Sitka district, says: ‘‘Considering the nature of the population, 
widely scattered in small settlements, the showing of 1,049 scholars in attendance 
~ out of a total of 1,755 persons between the ages of 5 and 17 years is certainly a ~ 
remarkable one. The number of natives speaking English doesnot much exeeed 
that of the scholars enrolled.” 
  * 1. —CONTRACT SCHOOLS. 
1.—SirKa DisrrRicr. 
   Sitka Industrial ‘Training School, Presbyterian (Prof. W. A. Kelly, principal 
with 17 assistants).—Boarding pupils, 164; natives. 
Professor Kelly reports: ‘‘ The past year has been one of marked progress, 
both in the schoolroom and in the industrial department. It is surprising 
how quickly-the pupils learn English when deprived of their native tongue. 
“Our school is distinctively coeducational. The boysand girls recite in the 
same classes, dine together in the same dining-room, and, under wholesome re- 
straint, have opportunities for social intercourse. : 
“A few years of sedulous training have developed in some of our oldest pupils a 
spirit of emulation, a sense of personal responsibility, self-respect, self-reliance, . 
and self-helpfulness which command respect. Mest of our large boys, advanced 
far enough to read intelligently in the second reader, are learning a trade (all 
being in school half of each day and at work half a day), and the diligence with _ 
which they pursue their studies, the zest with which they enter upon industrial ¥ 
work day after day is most praiseworthy of them and encouraging to their in- a 
structors. 
‘All of the shoes for the pupils of our school are hand-made in our shop, under 
the direction of a competent foreman. Considerable custom work is also done. 
“Our supply of barrels and half barrels far exceeds the demand, yet we con-
-P-A-G-E-656
   
       
           
       
                         
  1248 __-- EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
sider Coopering an excellent trade for our young men. Owing to high freight, 
. barrels are usually made at the fishing stations where needed, and coopers are 
in demand at those places. 
“We are always pressed with work in carpentry. The variety and scope of 
work have proved a most valuable source of instruction to the boys, most of 
_, whom are aptly adapted to mechanical industry. The boys have made com- 
mendable progress during the past year. Young men who can do carpenter 
work fairly well can find opportunity to ply their trade in any of the villages of 
Alaska. 
_ We have eight model cottages, six of which are occupied by young mar ried 
couples from the school. - These young folks have been thrown entirely upon 
their own responsiblitiy and resources, and they are doing right weil in earning 
a livelihood, while their honses are kept clean, neat, and homelike. ‘The en- 
vironments of family life among the young folk, in contradistinction to that in 
vogue among the natives, tend to create new conditions and inspire new im- 
pulses among their own people. 
«The general work of theschool, patching, mending, refitting, making new 
garments (aprons, towels, unc derwear, dresses), is no light task. Each girl 
-8 years old and upwards knits her own stockings, and the lar. ge girls find 
time to learn useful tidy work in order that they may be able to beautify their 
own homes with the work of their own hands. 
“The girls are trained in every department of household industry, kitchen, 
dining-room, teachers’ room, ete. Our girls numbering but fifty, the matron 
and her assistants find time to give each girl individual care in the details of 
housekeeping, thus gradually inculcating and developing a sense of personal 
responsibility. 
‘Our boys do the bread baking for the school, while the girlsin turn are taught 
how to bake and cook fora family. This special instruction in the art of cook- 
ing is given in the teachers’ kitchen, the cooking for the teachers and employés 
being done by our native girls. They are also trained to wait upon the table, 
and they serve the teachers and guests with grace and manners. Our young 
boys are also trained in our school kitchen and dining room. 
“Our pupils, from the children to the adults, sing with a spirit and understand- 
_ing that, outrivals many of the public schools. : 
‘Our brass band of 20 members dispenses music for the school and for the town 
on public occasions. 
“We have a military company of 35 members. The guns were kindly loaned 
us by the governor of the Territory. 
‘‘Lessons in patriotism are constantly inculeated. The Alaskans are a loyal, 
patriotic people. Rev. A. E. Austin, the veteran missionary of the school, has 
charge of the religious and dev tional exercises.” 
The time has fully come when a normal department should be added to this 
important school, and a beginning be made in training native teachers. 
2.—KADIAC DISTRICT. 
As yet there is no contract school in this important district, but the establish- 
- mentof one on Wood Island is urged by the teachers of the several day schools. 
Prof. Duff, of Afognak, writes, under date of March 21, 1890: ‘‘We must 
haye, and that very soon, an industrial school in this district, into which can 
be gathered and taught, the hundreds of orphansand neglected children. They 
are nearly all as white and as capable of improvement as the children of New 
England, or any other part of the country.” 
Prof. Roscoe, of Kadiak, writes, under date of September 29, 1890: ‘‘In every 
sattlement through this part of the country may be found poor, defenseless 
children, clothed only in rags, with no one to provide suitable food or cloth- 
ing, and living entirely on such charity as may be found among a heathen peo- 
ple. There are many destitute children, made so by the drunkenness and hence ‘ 
. vagabond character of their parents. In addition toa kind of beer which the 
natives'themselves make from sugar and graham flour, they succeed in buying 
large quantities of whisky from sailors and the more reckless class of traders. 
~The salmon canneries are, generally speaking, a curse to the natives. The 
Chinese employés bring, or rather smuggle, immense quantities of ‘‘samshu” 
into the country, and peddle it out to the natives. In the Aleut settlement of 
Afognak, the natives have sold the very fur bedding from their huts to obtain 
this vile stuff. The winter is upon them, and until recently they had been so 
demoralized with liquor that they had not laid in the usual winter’s supply of 
dried fish, their main subsistence. Without money and provisions and cloth-

ing, what misery and want will there be in-that village this winter, all because 
of intoxicating liquor! 
“White hunters, recently arrived from the westward, tell me it is thesame out 
there. The natives are demoralized by drink. Now, the future of this race is 
that, practically, they will perish from off the face of the globe unless they are 
Christianized—and that soon. It is a fact that the children do not generally 
show this terrible craving for strong drink. Thepupilsof my schoolare ashamed 
of their parents’ drinking, and we never see them drink any. It seems, there- 
fore, to be rather an acquired habit than an inherited appetite. It is only right 
and just that our Government take orphan childrenand inebriates’ childrenand 
put them in a good industrial school under religious teachers, who, in addition 
to moral and intellectual training, will. teach them the cultivation of the soil, 
the rearing of cattle, sheep, hogs, and poultry, the elements of some of the me- 
chanical arts; and the girls the arts of sewing and cooking. Such aschool can 
be and should be established in this vicinity.” - 
The establishment of such a school is under consideration by the Woman’s 
American Baptist Home Mission Society. 
3.—UNALASKA DISTRICT. 
The great distances of this district from the Bureau of Education, its remote- 
ness from a post-office (2,500 to 4,000 miles), and its inaccessibility, portions of 
the field having communication with the outside world but once a year, have 
led to the very general establishment of contract schools in this section of 
Alaska. In these schools well-known missionary societies share with the Goy- 
ernment thé expense and responsibility. 
Unalaska.—The ladies of the Woman’s Home Missionary Society of the Meth- 
odist Church are raising funds for the establishment of a school at this point. 
Carmel (Moravian, Rev. Frank E. Wolff, principal, with 4 assistants)—Board- 
ing pupils, 20; day pupils, 15; Eskimo. Of the boarding pupils 14 were boys 
and 6 girls. It isexpected that additional buildings will be erected by the onen- 
ing of the next school year. 
Bethel (Moravian, Rey. J. H. Kilbuck, principal, with 4 assistants).—Boarding 
pupils, 30; day pupils, 9; Eskimo. 
With regard to the school, Rev. J.H. Kilbuck reports, under date of May 28, 
1890: ‘‘ This past school y2ar has been our best, more scholars having been en- 
rolled, and in consequence a better average attendance. 
“The great drawback we find to be the running back and forth of scholars to 
their homes, which isnot conducive to progress. Weare compelled to acquiesce 
at present in order to hold scholars who have parents. The orphans, of course, 
we have full control of, and we keep them steadily at school. 
“The migratory habits of the people are the root of irregularattendance. The 
parents as a rule take out their children to help them in getting food and fur. 
It is only during the season of rest that we can hope to keep a large number of 
scholars. Ofcourse it is absolutely necessary that the boys be trained early to 
get their living, hence we cannot seriously object to the parents taking their 
children for this purpose. f 
“There are instances where parents send their children to school for the sole 
purpose of having them clothed, and then take them away after a short stay. 
This, however, never occurred before this year, and we will see to it that it will 
not happen again. 
“As regards behavior we can not complain. There was a case or two of im- 
morality, but severe and speedy measures soon put an end to that, and the gen- 
eral conduct of the boys has been more manly. Several of the boys have been 
taking music lessons during the year. They have made reasonable progress 
under the teaching of Signor Weber. 
“From the reports you will see that brother Weber has taught the school all - 
winter. Whenever! wasat home I kept the boys in in the evening, when I would 
give them general instruction in descriptive and physical geography and phys- 
jology. These evenings were pleasant to teachers and scholars, and many of 
the latter took a deep interest in the lessons. 
‘In speaking English the boys, as a rule, make but slow progress. We will 
have to resort to compulsory measures before they will take up English in earnest. 
“As in other years, the boys help in fishing, getting wood, and sawing and 
splitting firewood, and in general work they are quite a factor. As play ismore 
pleasing to boy nature than work, it sometimes takes a good command of pa- 
tience to keep them busy. The boys learn to get their food, es they supply us.

with fresh meat during the winter and spring, with the aid of snares, powder, 
and shot, and traps.” 
» Anvik (Episcopal, Rev. John W. Chapman, teacher).—Day pupils, 35; Indians. 
_ _ During the summer of 1°89, the school room was furnished with desks for 24 
children, which to the gratification of the teacher, were filled. The progress of 
the scholars proved most satisfactory. 
Rev. O. Parker writes, in connection with this school : ‘‘ In closing thisletter, 
I would say that both Mr. Chapman and J are still of the opinion that a board 
ing school is a necessary thing for the more successful carrying on of this work, 
and though we realize that a common school education should underlie all in- 
struction in other branches, yet we feel itall necessary that mechanical branches 
‘should be taught 2s soon as possible. Perhaps a dozen boys’ chests of tools and 
three or four sewing machines would enable us to make a beginning in that di- 
rection.’ ~ 
Kosoriffsky (Roman Catholic, Rev. P. Tosi, principal, with 6 assistants).— 
- Boarding pupils, 29; Eskimo. 
Nulato (Roman Catholic, Rey. A. Robaut, principal).—No report received. 
Kingeyan (Cape Prince of Wales), (Congregational, Messrs. H. R. Thornton, of 
Hampden Sidney, Va., and W. T. Lopp, of Valley City, Ind., teachers),—Popu- 
lation, Eskimo. . 5 
The teachers report: ‘‘The natives are peaceable, friendly, and intelligent, 
instead of ferocious, hostile, and stupid, as we were led to expect. We donot 
now entertain any fear of violence from them, and they already seem attached 
tous. In appearance they are a fine-looking set of people—robust and healthy— 
something like very good looking mulattoes, but with better features, and often 
brilliant color. In school they show as much intelligence as white children 
would under similar circumstances. We have now 65 pupils enrolled, although 
. fiye-sixths of the population are absent on trading voyages. In fall, winter, and 
spring we think we shall have at least300 pupils. Thisis the largest settlement 
- on the coast and would form a valuable center of missionary wor! Kk for the neigh- 
horing settlements at Port Clarence, the Diomede Island (middle of strait), Kot- 
zebue Sound, Kings Island, etc. 
The children are very sweet and attractive. We have never seen any signs of 
a fight or even a quarrel among them; nor have we seen any of them show any 
fcbnaion to disobey their parents, a most remarkable fact, we think. 
Point Hope (Episcopal, Mr. John B. Driggs, teacher).. —Population Eskimo. 
Point Barrow (Presbyterian, Mr. L. M. Stevenson, of Versailles, Ohio.

“These last three schools are in Arctic Alaska, and will be noticed more at 
length later on in the report.

Unalaklik (‘Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant in America,” Messrs. 
Axel E. Karlson and Aug. Anderson, teachers).—Rupils enrolled, 40 (31 boys 
and 9 girls); Eskimo. 
Yakutat (‘‘ Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant in America,” Rey. Albert 
Johnson and Rev. K. J. Henrickson, teachers).—Population, Thlinget; pupils 30. 
Nuklukahyet (‘Church M sionary Society,” London, England, Rev. and Mrs. 
T. H. Canham, teachers).—Population, Athabaskan Indians; pupils, 40. 
This school was established in thesummer of 1888, and has been taught in the 
Indian tongue. Drawing all of their supplies from England by way of Hudson 
Bay and across the continent by dog train the teachers have been much ham- 
pered by the want of suitable books and other facilities. Arrangements are in ~ 
progress to transfer this mission to the Protestant Episcopal Mission Society of 
the United States and reorganize the school on an English speaking basis as 
one of the contract schools of this department. 
Hoonah (Presbyterian, Rev. and Mrs. John W. McFarland, teachers).—Popu- 
lation, Thlinget; pupils, 126. 
Juneau (Presbyterian, Rev. Eugene 8. Willard in charge with 3 assistants).—

Douglass City (Friends, Mr. and Mrs. S. R. Moon in charge).—No statistics 
received. 
Jackson (Presbyterian, Mrs. A. R. McFarland in charge with 1 assistant).— 
This is a home similar to the one at Juneau. 
St. Paul Island (North American Commercial Company, Simeon Milevedoff, 
teacher).—Population, Aleut; attendance, 50. 
St. George Island (North American Commercial Company, Dr. A. L. Noyes, 
teacher).—Population, Aleut; attendance, 29. 
This and the preceding school on St. Paul are the two that are maintained on 
the Seal Islands in accordance with the terms of the lease issued by the U. S. 
Treasury Department. 
Through the influence of the priest of the Russo-Greek Church, the people 
are reluctant to have their children learn the English language. 
Mr. Charles J. Goff, Treasury agent in charge of the Seal Islands, writes in 
his annual report to the Department: ‘‘Mr. Milevedoff was energetic and un-. 
tiring in his efforts to advance the pupils, but.theré is very little interest taken 
by them in English speaking schools, so that there was but little progress 
made.’ 
Russian.—In addition to the above are a number of Russo-Greek parochial 
schools, supported by the imperial Government of Russia, which will 188 enum- 
erated in the tables of school attendance. 
The statistics of these schools have been furnished by Mr. Ivan Potroff, spe- 
cial agent for Alaska of the Eleventh Census.

_ feet in size, at a cost of $1,200, and at Chilkat a log schoolhouse, 20 by 30 feet 
in size, for $350. . 
EDUCATION IN THE EAST. 
Of the Alaskan children at Eastern schools, Miss Frances Willard graduated 
in June, 1890, at ayoung ladies’ seminary at Elizabeth, N. J. She will return to 
Alaska this summer; and be appointed assistant teacher in the industrial school 
at Sitka. 
Mr. Frederic Moore, of the Hoochinoo tribe, whom I brought East in the fall 
of 1886, and placed in the school at Mount Hermon, Mass., will also return to 
Alaska this season as Government teacher of the school at Hoonah. 
In the fall of 1887, at the expense of Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, of New York, 
I brought to Eastern schools Frederic Harris, Henry Phillips, Minnie Shotter, 
Flora Campbell, and Florence Wells, native children, and Olga Hilton (Rus- 
sian) from the industrial school at Sitka, and Blanche. C. Lewis, native, from 
Fort Wrangel. 
The two boys were placed in the Indian training echools at Carlisle, Pa., and 
the five girls at the young ladies’ seminary, Northfield, Mass.

tinsmith business, was taken sick from peritonitis, and died in the school hos-— 
pital on the 10th of June, 1890. 
Henry Phillips, having learned the printer’s trade, has now gone into the 
machine shop, where he is making good progress. 
Florence Wells, Blanche Lewis, and Olga Hilton arestill at Northfield. Flora 
Campbell has been changed from theschool at Northfield to one at Orange, N. J., 
where she is receiving drill as a kindergarten teacher. 
Minnie Shotter having developed a weakness in her eyes, will return home to 
Douglas, Alaska, where she will teach instrumental music. x 
This coming fall, David Skuviuk and George Nocochluke, Eskimo boys from 
the Kuskoquim Valley, will be taken East by Mrs. Bachman, and placed in the 
Indian training school at Carlisle, Pa. 
George and William Fredericks, of the Yukon Valley, will be sent by the 
~ Episcopalians to the Episcopal Institute at Burlington, Vt., Edward Marsden of 
the Presbyterian training school at Sitka, to Marietta College, Ohio, and Shawan. 
Sheshdaak of Fort Wrangel, to the Educational Home at Philadelphia. 
Through the liberality of Mr. Rudolph Neumann of the Alaska Commercial 
Company, I have arranged to send to the California normal school for teachers 
at San Jose, Miss Mattie Salamatoff, orphan daughter of aformer Russo-Greek 
priest at Belkofisky. 
When Alaska secures much needed laws to increase regular attendance of the 
native children at school, then there will be room and acall for many native - 
teachers. 
SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED IN ARCTIC ALASKA. 
In the extension of the school system over all Alaska a commencement has 
    been made within the Arctic Circle. Contract schools have been established at 
Point Barrow, Point Hope, and Cape Prince of Wales, the three principal vil- 
lages on the Arctic coast of Alaska. : x 
' This commencement involves much that is new and unusual in school work. 
The location of the schools is in a region so remote and inaccessible that they. 
are outside the world’s commerce. In August, when the ice will permit, a few 
whalers sail by, and a United States revenue marine steamer makes an annual | 
call, bringing the yearly mail and supplies. With the departure of the steamer 
the settlement is cut off for another eleven months from the world. There are 
years, however, when the northernmostschool, Point Barrow, can not be reached 
at all during the season, and the teacher will be two years without a mail or a 
fresh supply of provisions. And there is always the liability that a succession 
of severe seasons will isolate him for several years. 
Under the shadow of this possibility it is a relief to know that at this station, 
where the greatest danger is, the Government has a refuge station for ship- 
wrecked whalers, with provisions in store sufficient to last 20 men 5 years. If 7 
this supply should be exhausted before relief came, the teacher would be com- ~ 
pelled to adopt the diet of the country, to wit, whale blubber and seal meat. 
The food, clothing, and supplies for the teachers and the supplies for the 
schools mustneeds be taken annually on a Government vessel or a chartered 
schooner from San Franciso, between 3,000 and 4,000 distant. 
In an area as large as all of the New England and Middle States combined, © 
the three schools recently established occupy only the strategic places, separated 
hundreds of miles from each other. They are the central points from which 
future schools may be established. 
The location of these schools in a region where the winter term is one long 
night presents new problems. The constant need of lamps in the schoolroom 
isa matter of course. Buta greater difficulty is experienced in the confusion 
of time which arises from the absence of the sun to mark the alternate periods ~ 
of day and night. . 
Without a marked difference in the light between noon and midnight, all 
knowledge of time among a barbarous people becomes lost. They know no 
difference between 9 o’clock a. m. and 9 o’clock p.m. Consequently, when the 
school bell rings out into the Arctic darkness at 9 o'clock a. m. some of the 
pupils have just gone to bed, and are in their first sound sleep. Roused up and 
brought to the schoolroom, they fall asleep in their seats. Many of the pupils. 
have come to school without their breakfasts; with sleepy bodies and empty 
stomachs they are not in the best condition to make progress in their studies. 
Then, bearing in mind the fact that these children are wholly undisciplined and 
unaccustomed to restraint, the greatness of the task before the teacher begins 
to be appreciated. ee 
  Ma
-P-A-G-E-668
  1260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The schools are for the Arctic Eskimo, with their strange tongue and unwrit- 
ten language. Consequently at the opening of school the teacher could not 
understand what the pupils said or the pupils understand the instruction of 
pe eet: In two or three schools the teachers were unable to secure inter- 
preters. ‘ 
The schcols being located among an uncivilized and barbarous people, living 
in earth huts and disregarding all the laws of health, it became necessary, not 
only to erect the schoolhouse, but also the teacher’s residence, and, as far as 
possible, make both cold-proof with double walls, floor, and roof. 
The materials for these houses had to be taken from San Francisco on a 
chartered vessel, landed through the breakers on a coast without a harbor, and 
carried on the shoulders of men and women to the site of the buildings. 
Again, the schools were located among a people who were not only uncivilized, 
but also were reported by the whalers to be savages. Atone of the stations 
whalers have for years been afraid to drop anchor lest they should be attacked 
and murdered by the natives. At that station two young men are in charge of 
the school. They are the only white men in that region and thousands of miles 
from troops or even a policeman. Further, the schoolsare located among a fam- 
ishing population where the teachers have to do not only with the intellectual 
training, but also with the physical well-being, the general uplifting of the 
whole population out of barbarism into civilization. This involves questions of 
personal cleanliness, health, diet, improved habitations, drainage, and above all 
at present anincreased food supply. The people are on the verge of starvation, 
and the schools must provide and instruct them in new industries which will 
furnish a better support. / - 
As the schools will necessarily be much of the time out of the reach of con- 
trol and supervision, the codperation of well-known and responsible missionary 
organizations was sought, with the result that the American Missionary Associ- 
ation of the Congregational Church took charge of the school at Cape Prince of 
Wales, on Bering Straits, the Episcopal Missionary Society the one at Point 
Hope, and the Presbyterian Home Missionary Society the one at Point Barrow. 
The money for the establishment of the school at Point Barrow and the erec- 
tion of the buildings was contributed by Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, of New York; 
ae for Cape Prince of Wales by the Congregational Church of Southport, 
onn. 
Cape Prince of Wales is the most western school in America, and Point Barrow 
the most northern. Point Barrow is farther north than the celebrated North 
Cape of Europe. These schools are assisted by the United States Bureau of Ed- 
ucation. While negotiations were in progress with the missionary societies, an 
appeal was published in a number of the newspapers of the United States for 
volunteer teachers for the schools to be established at Point Barrow and Cape 
Prince of Wales. The call set forth the facts that the schools were beyond the 
ale of civilization, where communication with the outside world could be had 
ut once a year; that they were among a barbarous and perhaps savage people, 
where the risks were so great that ladies would not be allowed to go, and where 
the lives of the men would not be guarantied. Notwithstanding the hazardous 
and trying nature of the work, there were 24 applicants for the schools, some 12 
of whom were ladies. 
Prof, L. M. Stevenson, of Versailles, Ohio, was selected for Point Barrow; 
Dr. John B. Driggs, of Delaware, for Point Hope; and Mr. H. R. Thornton of 
peepden Sidney, Va.,and Mr. W. T. Lopp, of Valley City, Ind., for Cape Prince 
of Wales. 
A vessel, the Oscar and Hattie, was chartered at San Francisco to take up the 
materials for the buildings and supplies for the teachers and schools. The 
teachers found passage as far as Port Clarence, Bering Sea, on the steamer Jén- 
nie, tender to the whaling fleet, and from Port Clarence to destination on the 
whalers. 
I was kindly furnished transportation on the U.S. R. M.S. Bear. 
Atnoon on the Fourth of July the Bear dropped anchor in the open road- 
stead off the village Kingegan, Bering Straits. That afternoon, on the shores 
separating the Arctic Ocean from Bering Sea, and in front of the snow-capped 
mountains of Asia, plainly visible for miles, we celebrated our Fourth of July by 
laying the foundations of the first public-school building in Arctic Alaska. 
Upon the completion of the school building the Bear weighed anchor, sailed 
through Bering Straits into the Arctic Ocean, and 200 miles to the northward 
dropped anchor under the light of the midnight sun at Point Hope. 
Here again all hands that could be spared were sent ashore to work at the

school building. After completing the building we again turned our faces to- 
ward the North Pole. : 
After various detentions by the great ice field of the Arctic, on the 31st day 
of July we reached Point Barrow, over 800 miles north and east of Bering Straits. 
The next day, running before a gale, we rounded the northern end of the con- 
tinent and anchored on the eastern side of the Point. 
On thenorthernmost bluff of the continent was established probably the north- 
ernmost school in the world. 
SUPERVISION. 
Through the special permission of Hon. William Windom, Secretary of the 
Treasury, and the courtesies of Capt. L. G. Shepard, Chief of the Revenue Ma- 
rine Service, Capt. M. A. Healy, commanding the U. S. R. M. S. Bear, and 
Capt. A. C. Coulson, commanding the U. S. R. M. S. Rush, I was able to inspect, 
for the first time in four years,the schools at Afognag, Kadiak, Unga, and Una- 
laska, and also visit the settlements on the Bering Sea and Arctic coasts of 
Alaska, 
Mr. Windom, in furnishing me with transportation, recognized the fact that 
the revenue vessels visiting the native settlements of Alaska had, ‘‘ in addition 
to routine duties, the philanthropic work of caring for and assisting the native 
eoples.” 
iL In a letter concerning the trip he says: ‘‘ The ordinary duties of the revenue 
marine have been greatly augmented on the North Pacific and Arctic station by 
the service which it renders in affording aid and protection to the natives, who 
are often in peril and distress from the rigors of the climate, the exposed con- 
dition of the country, and their lack of knowledge in the ways of civilization. 
The service is doing good missionary work, and is an important factor among 
the instruments which are being utilized to improve the interests of these 
eople.” 
E The trip of the U.S. R. M. S. Bear was the ordinary annual cruise of one of 
the U. S. Revenue Marine steamers in Alaskan waters. 
Season after season she goes north in the spring to enforce the revenue laws 
and practically do police duty aroundsthe seal islands of Bering Sea and the 
native settlements stretching from Kadiak 1,500 milesto Attu, and from Unalaska 
1,200 miles northward to Point Barrow. In vast stretches of coast (from 10,000 
to 12,000 miles is a season’s cruise), unknown t) civilization, the flag of the reve- 
nue steamer is the only evidence of the authority of the Government ever seen 
and the only protection afforded. When Capt. Healy commenced cruising in 
these waters, schooners loaded with rum, were visiting every native settlement 
along the vast coast, and even some of the whalers were notabove trafficking in 
the accursed stuff.. The temptations were great, when a bottle of whisky would 
purchase $200 worth of furs, and the profits were a thousand fold. At thattime 
intemperance was threatening the extinction of the native race. Through the 
vigilance and tact of Capt. Healy this trade has been almost entirely broken up. 
It is also the duty of the revenue cutter, as far as possible, to be on hand to 
assist when disaster or shipwreck overtakes the whalers, to search after missing 
vessels, to note the bearing of different points of land, islands, ete., to determine 
the position of all bars and reefs encountered, to keep a record of tides and cur- 
rents, to take meteorological and astronomical observations for the benefit of 
commerce, to investigate scientific phenomena, and inquire into the mode of 
life, political and social relations of the native population, and make collections 
for the Smithsonian Institution, and to perform many other services beneficial 
to commerce, science, and humanity. 
This year, in addition to the ordinary routine, the commanding officer is 
charged with several special duties. In 1887-’88, Congress voted $1,000 for pres- 
ents to the natives near Cape Navarin, Asia, as a reward for having fed and 
cared for some American sailors wrecked on their coast. These presents were 
to be distributed on this trip. 
Then, scattered through Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean are islands and 
lands so remote and inaccessible that the ordinary census taker can not reach 
them; hence the commanding officer of the revenue cutter was appointed a 
special agent for the taking of the Eleventh Census in those places. This gave 
me an opportunity of visiting these little known regions. 
Again, the steamer was charged with the duty of conveying the material for 
astorehouse anda supply of provisions for the Government refuge station at 
Point Barrow; and last, but not least, the commanding officer was authorized to

  Prince of Wales and Point Hope, and give the general agent of education for © 
Alaska every facility for visiting the native settlements on the coast. 
At 4 o'clock on the morning of the 3d of June, 1890, we steamed out of the har- 
bor of Seattle. At9o’clock that evening we swept by the light-house at Cape 
Flattery and passed out to sea. 
For nine days and nights we sailed steadily west, without sceing land or sail 
and scarcely a bird or fish. On the evening of June 12 land was sighted, which 
proved to be Unimak Island. The next morning, rising carly, we were passing 
through Akutan Pass. The storm and fogs and rough waves of the preceding 
days were gone; the water was as quiet as a millpond. Pinnacles of rocks, iso- 
- lated and in groups, were to the right and to the left of us; bold headlands thou- 
sands of feet in height; mountain slopes covered with mosses of every variety 
of shade and great patches of snow; volcanoes with their craters hid in the 
- clouds were on either side, and all lighted up by the morning sun made a scene 
of surpassing loveliness and beauty. In due time we swept by Cape Erskine, 
rounded Priests Rock, and were in Unalaska Bay. Twelve miles up the bay 
and we were at Iliuiuk, better known as Unalaska, the commercial metropolis of 
_ the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea. 
The Aleutian Archipelago consists of anarrow chain of islands, extending from 
the end of the Alaskan Peninsula in-a general westerly direction for a thou- 
sand miles to Attu, the westernmost limit of the land possessions of the United 
States. This chain of islands separates Bering Sea from the Pacific Ocean, and 
gives coloring to the Russian claim of a “‘closed sea.” 
The discovery of these islands by Europeans is due to the unbounded ambi- 
tion of Peter the Great ef Russia, who, having founded a Russian empire in Hu- 
‘rope and Asia, would also found one in America. 
The western coast of America had been explored as far as Cape Mendocino, 
California, but from California north it was a vast unknown region—‘‘ the great 
northern mystery, with its Anian strait and silver mountains and divers other 
fabulous tales.” 
To solve these mysteries, to determine whether. Asia had land communication 
with America, to learn what lands and people were beyond his possessions on 
the eastern coast of Siberia, and to extend his empire from Asia to America, 
Peter the Great, in 1724, ordered two expeditions of exploration and placed them 
both under the command of Vitus Bering, a Dane in the Russian service. The 
_ expedition set out overland through Siberia on January 28, 1725, under Lieut, 
Chirikoff. 
Three days later the Emperor died, but the expeditions were energetically 
pushed by his widow and daughter. The first expedition, from 1725 to 1730, ex- 
plored Bering Straits, and settled the question of separation between Asia and 
America. 
The second expedition was fitted out by the Empress Catharine, and consisted 
of two vessels, the St. Paul, commanded by Bering himself, and the St. Peter, 
in charge of Alexei Ilich Chirikoff, second in command. The expedition was 
accompanied by several scientists and sailed from Avatcha Bay, Kamtschatka, 
on June 4,1741. This ill-fated expedition discovered the mainland of Alaska 
and the Aleutian Islands. But the remnant that brought back the news of the 
discovery of northwestern America, also brought with them the beautiful furs 
of the sea otter, and wide-awake merchants were not slow to see their opportu- 
nity. As the adventurous hunt for the little sable had led the hardy Cossack 
and extended Russian dominion from the Ural Mountains across Asia to Kamt- 
schatka and Bering Sea, so now the hunt for the sea otter was to extend Rus- 
sian settlement 2,000 miles along the coast of America. 
A few months after the return of Bering’s expedition in the spring of 1748, 
Emilian Bassof formed a partnership with a wealthy Moscow merchant, built a 
small vessel named the Kapiton, and commenced the fur trade of the newly dis- 
covered islands. On his second trip, in 1745, be collected 1,600 sea otters, 2,000 
fur seals, and 2,000 blue Arctic foxes. * 
This was the commencement on the part of the merchants of Siberia of a mad 
race after the furs of Alaska—a race so mad that they could not wait the secur- 
ing cf proper materials for the building of safe vessels and the procuring of 
trained seamen. Boats were hastily constructed of planks fastened together 
with raw hide or sealskin thongs. In these unseaworthy boats, without charts 
or compass, they boldly ventured to sea, and the half of them found a watery 
grave. Those that did return in safety with a fair cargo received from 2,000 to 
3,000 roubles each as their share of the profit.

On the 26th of September, 1745, for the first time the discharge of firearms 
was heard on the Aleutian Islands. A native was shot on the island of Agoto 
by a party of Russians under Chuprof. 3 
Then commenced a reign of lust, robbery, and bloodshed, which lasted for 50 
years. One Feodor Solovief is reported to have alone killed 3,000 Aleuts. Ve- 
niaminof, who was the leading Greek priest and first bishop in Alaska, declares 
that during that dreadful period Aleuts were used as targets for Russian prac- 
tice in firing; that one Solovief, finding the inhabitants of several of the Una- 
laska villages assembled on Egg Island, made an attack, slaughtering’ men, 
women, and children, until the sea was covered with the blood of the slain. 
One Lazaref threw over precipices, cut with knives, and split open with axes 
a number of Aleuts. z 
Whole villages were massacred by the Russians, so that Lieut. Sary, chief o! 
the Russian navy, who accompanied Capt. Billings’s expedition in 1790, declares 
that it was a very moderate estimate to place the number murdered at 5,000. . 
This first half-century of Russian occupation can be roughly summarized as 
follows: On the credit side, from $15,000,000 to.$20,000,009 worth of furs; on the 
debit side, thousands of Russians drowned, died of scurvy, and killed by natives, 
and thousands of natives needlessly murdered by the Russians. 
A better day dawned for the poor natives of Alaska in the coming of Grigor 
Ivanovich Shelikof, a merchant of Okhotsk, who has been justly styled the 
founder of the Russian colonies in Alaska. He introduced reforms in the meth- 
ods of hunting, redressed abuses, formed permanent settlements, and procured. 
concessions and power from the Emperor. 
The work commenced by him was afterwards enlarged by Alexander Baranof, ~ 
The largest and most important-of the Aleutian Islands is Unalaska. This 
island is 120 miles long and 40 wide. It contains three separate groups of moun- 
tains. It also has an active volcano, Makushin, 5,474 feet high. From a cave 
at the southern end of the island were taken eleven mummies for the Smithso- 
nian Institution. 
It also possesses several deep bays, of which Unalaska is one of the longest. 
In their season codfish, salmon, halibut, and herring abound in those waters. 
The island was first sighted by Lieut. Chirikof, of Bering’s expedition, on the 
4th of September, 1741. The first landing was made by a merchant of Turinsk, 
Stepan Glottof, in the vessel Yulian. This was in the fall of 1759. Glottof gave 
the world the first map of that region, and is said to have baptized many of the 
natives into the Greek faith. 
To the average American the Aleutian Islands seem so remote, and concerning 
them so little is known, that but few think of them as having been the theater 
of stirring events and as having a history extending back one hundred and fifty 
years, but such is the case. 
Unalaska shares with the other islands in that history.° For thirty years it | 
was a struggle between the rapacious, cruel, and bloody fur-trader and the Aleuts 
striving to preserve their homes and freedom. 'The end was the complete sub- 
jugation of the natives. 
In January, 1762, a party of fur hunters, under the leadership of Golodof and 
Pushkaref, landed uponthe island. Owing to their excesses against the natives, 
several weré killed and the rest fled the island the following May.» But the 
island was too rich in furs to be given up. That same fall another party came 
under the leadership of Drushinnin. Outraging the natives, the latter com- 
menced on the 4th of December a series of attacks which resulted in the break- 
ing up of the Russian settlement, only 4 out of 150 men escaping with their 
lives. 
In August, 1763, Capt. Korovin, of the vessel St. Troiiska, formed asettlement. 
This also was broken up by the natives. 
In 1764 Capt. Solovief formed asettlement. His stay onthe island was marked 
by such bloody atrocities that the few who survived were completely subjugated. 
His name has come through a hundred years of local tradition as the synonym 
of cruelty. Among other things, it is said that he experimented upon the pen- 
etrative power of his bullets by binding 12 Aleuts in arow and then firing through 
them at short range. The bullet stopped at the ninth man, 
In 1770, when the American colonists were preparing themselves for the 
struggle for independence, the struggle of the Aleuts was ending. They had 
given their lives in vain. The few who were left could no longer maintain the 
unequal conflict and were reduced to practical slavery. 
But Unalaska has since seen better days and been visited by a better class. 
On the 16th of September, 1768, Capt. Levashef, in charge of a Russian scien- 
) tific expedition, dropped his anchor and wintered on the island. 
 
-P-A-G-E-672

  1264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
In 1778 it was visited by the celebrated Capt. Cook with his ships Resolution 
and Discovery. On the 21st of July, 1787, Capt. Martine, in command of two 
Spanish vessels on a tour of exploration, landed and took possession of the island 
in the name of the King of Spain. 
In 1709 Unalaska was visited by one of the most remarkable men of the day, 
Alexander Baranof, who was to rule Alaska for the next twenty-eight years, 
bring order out of confusion, and, carrying out and enlarging the plans of the 
merchant Shelikof, create a Russianempire in America. 
On the 30th of September of that year, the ship 7'rekh Sviatiteli, upon ‘which 
he had embarked for Kadiak Island, was wrecked and he was compelled to 
spend the winter at Unalaska. Heimprovedhis time by studying the character 
of the people with whom he had to deal, and forming the plans which he after- 
wards so successfully executed. In 1808 a rude log chapel was erected for the 
worship of the Greek Church. This was torn down in 1826 and a better church 
built in its place. In or about 1795 a Greek priest, Father Makar, took up his 
abode on the island, and had great success in baptizing the natives. 
He was followed in 1824 by Innocentius Veniaminof, who was made bishop of 
all Alaska in 1840. He was subsequently recalled to Russia and made metro- 
politan of Moscow, the highest ecclesiastical position in the Russo-Greek Church. 
On the 25th of June, 1791, the island was visited by Capt. Billings, in charge 
of the Russian ‘‘ astronomical and geographical exposition for navigating the 
frozen sea and describing its coasts, islands,” etc. 
In August, 1815, the place was visited by the Russian exploring expedition in 
search of the ‘‘ Northwest passage ” on the Rurik, Otto von Kotzebue command- 
ing. 
- In 1827 a Russian exploring expedition, under the command of Capt. Lutke, 
visited the island. \ 
From the beginning of Russian rule to the present day, it has been the com- 
mercial metropolis of the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea. 
But after all this stirring history of a century and a half, it is rather disap- 
pointing to learn that up to twenty years ago, when the Americans took pos- 
session, it was still asmall village of barabaras or dirt huts, partly under ground, 
the Russian conquerors having largely adopted native ways of living. Since 
then the village has been greatly improved and almost rebuilt at the expense of 
the Alaska Commercial Company. They have erected 18 small, but comforta- 
ble frame cottages for their employés, together with residences for officers, 
store, wharf, and warehouses. The village has a population of from 14 to 20 
white men, two white women, and about 400 Aleuts and Creoles. The Greek 
Church has a church and parsonage and school-house. 
Upon landing, I was met by Frof. John A. Tuck, who, with his estimable 
wife, is in charge of the Government school. The three days that the steamer 
remained at Unalaska were given to the work of the school. 
The first year of their work has been unexpectedly successful, and I felt, with 
the teachers, that the time had come for the commencement of the ‘‘ Home,” 
which the Methodist Woman’s Home Missionary Society of the United States 
have had under advisement for two or three years, and for which, under the 
leadership of Mrs. L. H. Daggett, of Boston, they have been raising funds. 
During my stay I had the satisfaction of seeing the ‘‘Home” commenced by 
Professor and Mrs. Tuck taking into their family two orphan girls from the 
island of Attu. A suitable building for the ‘‘Home” will be erected by the 
Methodist ladies this coming spring. 
On Sabbath morning I attended the Greek Church and saw the services in 
connection with the baptism of children. Fourteen infants were presented be- 
fore the altar of the church. The priest had in his hand a silver spoon with a 
handle about a foot long, and a bowl about the size of that of a spoon for a salt- 
cellar. With this spoon the priest dipped water from a silver cup into the mouth 
of the babe, the attendant priest holding a napkin under the child’s chin. After 
receiving the water, the cup was pressed. to the lips of the babe. The mother 
or godmother then carried it to aside table, where it received a small piece of 
bread, and if old enough, a drink of water to wash down the bread. From the 
breaa table, the child was carried to the altar platform, and its lips pressed toa 
picture of the Virgin and Child. The babe was then kissed by its god-mother. 
These babes were dressed in long white dresses, with a blue or red silk ribbon 
or sash around the waist. 
On the morning of the 17th of June the Bear sailed for Bogoslof Island. 
Four or five miles west of Unalaska Island is that of Umnak. From its north- 
ern side, stretching out for miles into Bering Sea, is a reef. At the time of

  Capt. Cook’s visit in 1778, the northern end of this reef was marked by a rock 
875 feet high rising from the sea in the form of a tower. This he named “Ship 
Rock.” 
On the 18th of May, 1796, during a violent storm, from the northwest, the 
inhabitants of Unalaska and Umnak Islands were startled by distant explosions 
and rumbling shocks of an earthquake. On the morning of the third day, when 
the sky had cleared, it was found that an island 1? miles long, and three-fourths 
of amile wide, in the formof a cone 2,240 feéthigh, had been thrown up out of the 
sea1,200feet distantfrom Ship Rock. Eight years afterwards, some hunters visit- 
ing the spot found the adjacent sea still warm and the rocks too hotfor landing. 
The island continued to grow in circumference and height until 1823. Since 
then it has gradually decreased in height until in 1884 it measured but 324 feet. 
In 1882 the natives reported Bogoslofas again smoking. On the 27th of Septem- 
ber, 1883, Capt. Anderson, of the schooner Mathew Turner, sailed partly around 
the island. He reported thata new island had appeared one-half of a mile in cir- 
cumference, and was throwing out great masses of rock and smoke and steam. 
On the 20th of October, 1883, a shower of volcanic ashes fell at Unalaska, and 
was supposed tocome from thisisland. The firstlanding and official investigation 
was made on the 21st of May, 1884, by Capt. M. A. Healy, commanding United 
States Revenue Steamer Corwin. 
» The new cone proved to be about 1,760 feet from the old one, the two being 
connected bya low sandspit 326 feet wide, with Ship Rock on the spit between 
the two cones. The extreme length of the island was found to be 7,904 feet, its 
general trend SE. by E. and NW. by W. 
From the 17th to the 22d of last February the sky was obscured with a cloud 
of ashes, a liberal shower of which fell in the village of Unalaska, 50 miles away. 
A pillar of flame and smoke ascended high into the heavens. It has been vari- 
ously estimated from 4 to 15 miles high, 
The first white man to pass by was Capt. Everett E. Smith, of the steam whal- 
ing bark Balcena, who reported the appearance of four new islands in the vicin- 
ity. 
“i was therefore with feclings of more than ordinary interest that in the early 
morning of Tuesday, June 17, we steamed from Unalaska, bound for Bogoslof. 
Long before we reached the island, great white clouds of steam were seen upon 
the horizon. As we approached nearer all eyes were eagerly bent and glasses 
trained upon the land looming above the horizon, Butthecaptain was puzzled. 
He could not make out his landmarks. The two volcanic cones were all right, 
but where was Ship Rock? Soon we were among myriads of birds which had 
chosen these inaccessible and warm rocks for their breeding ground. 
the chains to throw the lead. We steamed on and on until it seemed as if we 
would steam into the volcano itself; sulphurous smoke enveloped us, almost 
strangled us. Amid the roar of the breakers and the screaming of the birds 
the leadman called out, ‘‘ No bottom at17.” Where previously the captain had 
anchored in 8 fathoms of water, no bottom was now found at 100 fathoms. Ap- 
parently the bottom of the sea had fallen out, carrying with it the four islands 
reported only a few weeks before by Capt. Smith. We steamed in safety over 
their former sites. More than that, the center of the island had dropped out, 
and where for centuries Ship Rock had stood, a well-known mark to the mar- 
iner, was now a lake. 
It was with peculiar sensations that we steamed partly around the island, so 
close that we could look into the sulphur-lined steam vents, and, enveloped in 
its steam, could almost imagine that we saw ‘‘fire and brimstone.” 
The captain had intended making a landing and an investigation of the phe- 
nomena, but failing to find an anchorage, and the wind having freshened so that 
it was unsafe landing through the breakers, he reluctantly turned away and 
steamed for the Seal Islands. 
For years the careful observers of the movements of the seal among the early           
        
        
        
              
    
         
       
       
    
          returned in the fail, accompanied by their young, and a tradition existed among 
the natives that an Aleut had once been cast away upon islands to the north, 
which they called Amik. When in 1781 the usual catch of furs began to de- 
crease upon the Aleutian Islands, efforts were made to discover this supposed 
island. In 1786 the search was joined by Master Gerassim Gavrilovich Pribylof, 
in the vessel St. George. But so well has nature hidden these islands, the favor- 
ite home of the fur seal, among the fogs of Bering Sea, that Pribylof cruised 
three weeks in their vicinity, with every evidence of being in the neighbor-

  “hood of land, and yet unable to discover it. But at length the fog lifted, and _ 
ea early in June land was sighted, which he called St. George. A party of hun- 
ters were left on the island for the winter and they in turn discovered thelarger 
island of St. Paul. 
Over 500,000 skins were taken during the year, and the islands early began 
to be the ‘‘bank” from which Baranof raised the funds to carry on his gov-. 
ernment in Alaska. If he needed a ship’s load of provisions and supplies for 
his colonies, all he had to do was to kill more seal and pay in seal skins. So 
great was the slaughter that the Government was compelled to interfere and 
in 1895 prohibited their killing for a period of five years. From 1820 to 1867, 
the year of the transfer, 42,000 skins were annually exported to England, the 
United States, and Canada. Z 
The first years after the transfer of Alaska to the United Statesagain witnessed 
an indiscriminate slaughter by different firms, until Congress was compelled 
to interfere and authorize the Treasury Department to lease the islands under 
suitable restrictions to a responsible company. : 
This was the origin of the Alaska Commercial Company of San Francisco, 
which has held the lease for the past twenty years, paying the Government an- 
nually a rental of $55,000, and a royalty of $2.624 on each of the 100,000 skins al- 
lowed to be taken. This produced a revenue of $317,500 per year. Last spring 
’ the islands were relet for another twenty years to the North American Com-~ 
mercial Company of San Francisco. By the terms of the new lease the Govern- 
ment will be the recipient of about $1,000,000 per year. 
At 9:30 p. m. on June 18, the captain dropped anchor in Southwest Harbor, 
St. George Island. Being unable to land through the breakers, the next day the 
ship sailed around the southernend of the island and anchored at noon in Garden 
Cove. The chart said that there was a trail to the village, 2or 3 miles distant. 
At the village they called it 4 miles; the-young officers that walked it came to 
the conclusion that it was nearer 14 miles. 
At 9:15 p.m. the anchor was weighed and we steamed northward for St. Paul 
Island. 
Going on deck about 6 o’clock on the morning of June 20, the ship was abreast 
of St. Paul Island, in full sight of the village. Behind us.wvas Otter Island with 
its bluff shore, and still further behind in the hazy distance the Island of St. 
George. To our rightwas Walrus Island, and toour left St. Paul, withits gentle 
slopes of green grass and moss, its bleak rocks and sand beaches covered in the 
season with the fur seal. To the rightof the village were seen men driving a 
herd of seal to the killing grounds. Upon a hillnear the village floated the stars 
_ and stripes, together with the flag of the North American Commercial Company, 
the lessees of the island. The stars and stripes also floated over the building 
oceupied by Mr. Charles J. Goff, the United States Treasury agent. 
From the bay the village presents a more pleasing and inviting appearance 
than any other in Alaska. The large houses oceupied by the North American 
Commercial Company for their own use, the house of the Treasury agent, the 
Greek church and the priest’s residence, the schoolhouse and the neat white 
cottages of the people, with their orderly arrangement by streets, ranged as they 
are on the gentle slope of a hill, make an attractive picture. Before we rose 
from an early breakfast, Messrs. Goff, Tingle, Redpath, and Elliott were an- 
nounced. They had come to get their mail, which Capt. Healy had brought 
up for them. After breakfast T went ashore with Mr. Goff, who with his assist- 
ant, Mr. Nettleton, of Minneapolis, also Mr. H. W. Elliott, of Washington, and 
Mr. Tingle, the company’s agent, did all in their power to make the day pleasant 
and-profitable to me. 
Soon after landing Mr. Goff announced that a killing had commenced, and we 
walked over to the grounds to witness the process. A band of 200 or 300 seals 
were huddled together in the care of keepers. From this band 15 to 20 seals 
would be taken at-a time, and driven a few yards from the main band. Four or 
five men with long clubs then took charge of the small band, and selecting those 
of suitable size and age, killed them by one blow on the head. The men with 
clubs were followed by others with knives, who stabbed the seals to let out the 
blood. They were followed by the skin men, who took off the skin with the 
layer of fatadhering to it. These in turn were followed by those who separated 
the fat from the skin. The skins were then carried to the salting house, where 
they were carefully counted and salted down. While this was going on, a score 
of women and girls were filling skin bags with masses of fat, which were carried 
on their backs to their homes, and then fried out into oil (butter) for winter use. 
The flesh was also carried home, cut into thin strips, and hung on poles to dry. 
 
-P-A-G-E-675
        EDUCATION IN ALASKA, : 1267 
After being dried, it is stuffed into the stomachs of the sea lion, which have. been 
cleaned and prepared for the purpose. After filling it with the dried meat, seal 
oil is poured in, filling up all the vacant spaces. You then have a huge sausage 
between two and three feet in diameter. This is stowed away for winter use. 
In passing through the village we saw women at work cleaning the intestines 
of the sea lion, very much as eastern farm-wives prepare intestines for sausages. 
After being cleansed they are hung out to dry ; when dry they are slit length- 
wise and form a band 3 or 4 inches wide and from 75 to 100 feet long. From 
these strips are made the famous kamileka, or waterproof coats worn by these 
people. These coats are much lighter, stronger, and dryer, resisting rain 
longer and better than the rubber goods of commerce. Among the Eskimo of 
the Arctic the larger intestines of the walrus are used, making a correspond- 
ingly wider band. a 
The Greek church at this place is the best painted and neatest kept of any 
that I have seen in the Territory. The silver candlesticks and other ornaments 
when not in use were kept from the dust by bag coverings. The church isrich, 
being supported by a certain percentage of the wages of the whole population. 
In the adjoining graveyard a large Greek crogs made from 2-inch plank stood at 
the head of each grave. With but two or three exceptions, these contained no 
name or date, nothing to indicate who was buried there. A gentleman who has 
attended many of their funerals says he never saw any,even the nearestrelative 
of the deceased, shed a tear or give any outward sign of grief. They say it is 
good to die. After the burial all the friends are invited to the former residence 
of the deceased to tea. 
With Mr. Goff I also visited the company’s schoolhouse. It is well built, com- 
modious, and well furnished in its appointments. Owing to the opposition of 
the Greek Church, which does not wish the children to learn English, but little 
progress has apparently been made. The school has been in operation for twenty 
years, and yet [ could not find a child who could converse in the English lan- 
guage, although I was informed that some of them understood what I said to 
them. Igreatly regret that it was vacation time and that I could notsee the 
school in session. - ‘ 
Mr. H. W.. Elliott, who is here under appointment from the Secretary of the 
Treasury to report on the present condition of seal life, pointed out to me the 
location of the leading seal rookeries, and lamented the seeming fact that the 
seal were greatly decreasing in numbers. At dinner we were all the guests of 
Mr. Tingle; the principal fresh meat being roasted seal. I found it very pala- 
table. - 
The population of the island consists of 5 whites and 217 natives. There are 
23 boys and 41 girls between the ages of 5 and 17. 
About 4:30, the tide favoring, we returned to the ship after a very enjoyable 
day on shore... At5 p.m. the steamer got under way. We rounded the south- 
ern end of the island and fetched our course for Asia. 
SIBERIA. 
Siberia, the battle-ground of conquering Cossack and free-booting Promy- 
shlenki in their century’s march across Asia, is, in its- northern and northwest- — 
ern section, a dreary waste of low-rolling and frozen tundra or rugged, snow- 
covered and storm-swept mountains, the land of the fierce howling poorga, of 
wild beasts and scattered tribes of brave, hardy, and half-civilized people. 
Its bleak, ice-skirted, snow-covered shore north of Kamchatka was. our next 
tanding place. Off thiscoaston the 5th of-May, 1885, the whaling bark Napoleon 
was caught and crushed in the ice. Thedisaster came sosuddenly that the crew 
had barely time to spring into the boats without provisions or extra clothing. 
There were four boats with nine in each. Four days afterthe wreck two of the ~ 
boats were seen by the bark Flectwing, and their crews rescued, five of them 
dying from the effects of theexposure. The remaining eighteen men after seven 
days’ tossing about in the sea, took refuge upon alarge field of ice, where they 
remained twenty-six days. During this time one-half of their number died from 
exhaustion and starvation. While on theice all they had to eat were two small 
seals, which were caught. One of the men, Mr. J. B. Vincent, being unable to 
eat the raw seal, had not a mouthful of nourishment for eleven days. 
_. On the 7th of June the nine survivors again took to the boat, and in three 
days effected a landing on the Siberian coast, to the southwest of Cape Nayarin. 
The day after they landed, five of the remaining died, being so badly frozen that 
their limbs dropped off. Rogers, the mate, Lawrence, a boat steerer, and Wal-

: ters, the cooper, were also badly frozen and helpless. These were cared for by 
the natives, who, though in a half-starving condition themselves, divided their 
living with them. The three men lived through the winter, subsisting on dried 
- fish until March, when Lawrence died, followed the next day by Rogers, and 
shortly afterwards by Wallace, leaving Vincent the sole survivor of the party. 
Vincent, being in better physical condition than the others, was adopted by a 
family having a herd of domesticated reindeer, and therefore had more to eat. 
With them he remained for over two years until found and rescued July 15, 
1887, by Capt. M. A. Héaly, commanding the United States revenue marine 
steamer Bear. 
While among the deer men, Mr, Vincent carved on a board with a knife the 
following message, and asked his new made friends on the coast to give it to the 
first shipthey saw. On one side was ‘‘1887 J.B. V. Bk.Nap. Tobacco give.” 
On the reverse side was ‘‘S. W. C. Nay., 10 M. Help Come.” This piece of 
wood ultimately reached Capt. Healy and told the story, ‘‘1887, J. B. Vincent 
of the bark Napoleon; is10 miles southwest of Cape Navarin. Come to his rescue. 
Give the bearer some tobacco for his trouble.” 
Capt. Healy was at Port Clarence when he received the message. With his 
usual promptness, he steamed over-to the coast of Siberia, and after some diffi- 
culty in the fog, finally found and rescued the wrecked sailor. 
During the following winter Congress made an appropriation for the purchase 
of presents with which to reward the natives for their care of Mr. Vincent and 
his comrades. Capt. Healy was delegated to distribute these presents, and for 
that purpose we were en route to Siberia. 
Monday, June 23, opened very foggy, but about 8 o’clock the fog lifted, and 
Cape Navarin and the coast of Siberia were in full view. A more desolate and 
dreary scene it is hard to conceive of. A range of mountains with an elevation 
of about 2,000 feet lined the coast. Cape Navarin itself ended ina precipice 2,512 
feet in height, the base of which descended into the sea. Although it was solate 
- in June, the whole country was still covered with snow, except bare spots here 
and there. Sleds drawn by dogs and reindeer were still in common use. Even 
while approaching the coast, snow storms were seen sweeping through the ca- 
fions of the mountains. The temperature on deck at noon was 45°. A sharp 
lookout was kept for the native village which was located upon the map, but 
which was notfoundupon thecoast. At length two tents were seen on the beach, . 
and abreast of them we anchored at2p.m. The Captain and Mrs. Healy, Lieut. 
Dimmock, and myself went ashore. The captain at once sent messengers in 
every direction on dog-sleds to gather the people together. The main distribu- 
  tion of presents took place on the afternoon of the 24th, and consisted of 1,000 
yards of drilling, 500 yards of calico, 100 packages of glovers’ needles, 8 dozen 
hand:looking-glasses, 1,500 pounds of ship bread, 2 half-barrels of sugar, 2 barrels 
of molasses, 1 chest of tea, 6 dozen combs,5 dozen packages of linen thread, 4 
dozen tin pails and pans, 1 dozen iron pots, 2 kegs of nails with hammers, files, 
gimlets, saws, braces, and other carpenter tools, 1 dozen rifles and one-half dozen 
shotguns, 125 pounds of powder, 300 pounds lead, 2 bags of shot and 20,000 caps, 
1,000 cartridges, axes, hatchets, and butcher knives, 2 dozen fox-traps, 4 dozen 
pipes, tobacco, snuff, 1 box goggles, one package fish-hooks and lines, beads, and 
1 box children’s toys. . Total value, $1,000. 
There are three tribes or families of natives on the Bering Sea coast of Siberia: 
the Kamtchatkans, occupying the peninsula of the same name, the Tchuctchees, 
occupying the general region west of Bering Straits and the Gulf of Anadir, and 
the Koriaks, occupying the country between the former two. Our visit was to 
the Koriaks, although I afterwards met.the Tchuctchees at East Cape. The 
Koriaks can be divided into three classes: the civilized ones that have come more 
or less under the influence of the Russian settlements in the interior, the coast 
men, who mainly subsist on the whale, walrus, and seal, and the deer men, who 
live off their herds of domesticated reindeer. The latter two classes are more 
or less nomadic and pagan. They are said to offer sacrifices of dogs. 
We met the deer and coast Koriaks. They are a good sized, robust, athletic, 
and fleshy people, with prominent cheek bones, broad noses, black eyes, and a 
pleasant, good-natured expression. The men shave the crown of their heads, 
leaving a fringe of coarse, black hair round the forehead and sides, giving them 
the appearance of so many monks. They are said to do this that the flying of 
the hair in the wind may not frighten the wild reindeer when hunting. 
The women wear their hair parted in the middle, the two braids hanging down 
the back.- Some braid strings of beads around their necks or pendant from their 
ears.
-P-A-G-E-677
         
The women are very generally tattooed down the center of the forehead and 
along each side of the nose to the nostril, and elaborate designs cover the cheek. _ 
T also saw tattooing on the hands, wrists, and arms. One girl had two waving 
lines from the forehead to the nostrils, and nine in a fan shape from the lower 
lip to the chin. Another, with the other marks, had an ‘ X” on the chin at each: 
corner of her mouth. Occasionally the men were tattooed. Isawahusband and 
wife marked exactly alike. They were dressed exclusively in skins and furs. 
Neither on their persons nor in the construction of their tents, furnishings, or 
bedding did I see as much as a thread of wool or cotton. * Their clothing, tents, 
and bedding are made from reindeer skins. Their food is largely dried rein- 
deer meat, supplemented with whale and sealblubber. Their thread is reindeer 
sinew, and from the reindeer horns are made many household implements. 
The dress of both men and women is made of a large skin shirt, so constructed 
that the fur can be worn outside or next to the skin, as may be desired, and a © 
pair of skin pants with thefur inside. These extend tothe knee. Those of the 
women are wide, so that when tied at the knee, they present. a baggy appear- 
ance similar to Turkish trousers. Then a pair of fur boots soled with seal or 
walrus hide. The tops of the boots are tied closely around the bottom of the 
pants. Suspended by a string around the neck is a fur hood, which can be - 
pulled over the head when needed. The babe is carried inside the parka, or 
--fur coat, on the back of the mother. A belt around the waist of the parka keeps 
the babe from slipping down too far. The dress of the babe consists of a single 
garment of reindeer skin, but this garment combines hood, coat, pants, shoes, 
and mittens all in one. When dressed, only a small portion of the face of the 
child is visible. 
The sleds are made of birch runners. Over these are a half-dozen arches 
made of reindeer horns. Thesearches connect the runners and support the floor . 
of the sled. At the rear end of the sled is a slight railing, to support the 
back of thetraveler. Noironis used in making the sled; all the parts are firmly — 
lashed together with whalebone strips or rawhide. The runners are shod 
with bone. Before these are harnessed six dogs in pairs, or tworeindeer. The 
reindeer are also driven side by side. The harness of the reindeer is very 
simple, being astrap around his neck connected with a.trace between his legs. 
The tents we saw are conical, like those of the Dakota Indians, the poles’ 
being covered with reindeer skins or walrus hides. In some portiens of the 
country, where straight poles can not be had, whalebones are used for frames, 
and the tents are oval inshape. Within the tents for the sake of greater warmth 
are small inner inclosures made by hanging reindeer-skin curtains. These 
small inclosures are the sleeping places. As they follow their herds from one 
pasturage to another these tents are easily taken down, loaded on the sled, re- 
moved to the next camp and set up again. 
They have two kinds of boats, consisting of a light frame of birchwoood, over 
which is stretched sealor walrusskin. The large, open boat is called by the na- 
tives oomiak, by the Kamtchatkans bidar. These will carry from 25 to 50 peo- 
ple. The smaller boat is intended for from 1 to 3 men, and is entirely encased 
‘in skin, except the openings left forthe men to sit in. These are called kyaks, 
kaiak, or bidarka. 
In hunting whales, walrus, and seals they use spears with ivory points set in 
bone sockets. Small birds and animals are trapped. Their gun is a miniature 
rifle with a barrel not over 2 feetlong. To the stock are fastened by a hinge 
two light sticks, which are used as supports to the gun when firing. Powder 
and lead are so difficult to obtain and so expensive that the hunter runs no un- — 
necessary risk in using it. It is said that sometimes they hunt to recover the 
bullet in order to use itagain. I tried in vain to purchase one of these guns. 
They seem-to have no chiefs, their organization being largely patriarchal. If 
one man accumulates more deer than his neighbors, he secures a certain 
amount of influence on account of his wealth. Poor men, who have no. deer of 
their own, join his band, and assist in caring for his herd, in return for food and 
clothing. The only law that governs the community seems to’ be the natural 
law that, is found in all barbarous tribes, that of retaliation. A few years ago a 
feud started between a band living on the coast, and a band of deer men living 
in the neighborhood, during which the latter band was exterminated. : 
They impressed me as a very unselfish people. In the distribution of the 
presents none seemed to think that someone else was receiving more than he. 
The more frequent expression of anxiety seemed to be that no one should ba 
overlooked. They also called attention to some who were unavoidably absent, 
and offered to take them their share. Evidently some of them had never bsen

upon a ship before, and they were naturally curious to look all over it. Some- 
times when a family came off in their boat, at first only the men came aboard. 
After a while, as if gaining confidence, the women and children would venture. 
Frequently as soon as they were on deck they would sit down as if afraid to 
stand up. One woman reaching the deck in safety expressed her joy by throw- 
ing her arms around her husband’s neck and they rubbed noses (their method 
_ of salutation in the place of kissing). 
T secured from them for the museum of the Society of Natural History and 
Ethnography at Sitka, a number of things to illustrate their manner of living. 
There being a herd of some 1,500 reindeer a few miles up the coast, in order 
_ that we might visit them and the ship procure some fresh meat, after the dis- 
tribution of the presents the captain got under way and sailed up to the reindeer 
herd, where he again anchored. Going ashore, we found the herd on the beach, 
some of them apparently drinking the salt water. The winter with its unusual 
-amount of snow had been severe upon them, so that they were very poor. They 
were also shedding their hair and their horns were in the velvet, so they did 
“not make a veryimpressive appearance. Off to oneside two sleds werestanding 
with two deer attached to each. Getting upon one of the sleds, by motions I 
. made them understand that I wanted a ride, anda short one was givenme. The 
reindeer were much smaller than I had expected to find them, the majority of 
them being not much larger than the wild deer of other sections. The captain 
purchased four deer, which were slaughtered and dressed for him, When get- 
ting ready to lasso the deer the owner's family seated themselves in a circle on 
the ground, where probably some rites connected with their superstitions were 
‘observed. Upen attempting to approach the circle we were motioned away. 
After a little while the men went out and lassoed a selected animal, which was 
led out on one side of the herd. The man that was leading it stationed himself 
directly in front of the animal and held him firmly by the two horns. Another 
_ with a butcher knife stood at the side of the deer. An old man, probably the 
owner, went off to the eastward, and placing his back to the setting sun seemed 
engaged in prayer, upon the conclusion of which he turned around and faced 
the deer. This was the signal for knifing the animal. With apparently no ef- 
fort, the knife was pushed to the heart and withdrawn. The animal seemed to 
suffer no pain, and ina few seconds sank to his kneesand rolled over on hisside. 
While this was taking place the old man before mentioned stood erect, motion- 
less, with his hand over his eyes. When the deer was dead he approached, and 
taking a handful of hair and blood from the wound, impressively threw it to the 
eastward. This was repeated a second time. Upon the killing of the second 
animal the wife of the owner cast the hair and blood to the eastward. Ididnot 
remain to the slaughter of the other two. While the animal was bleeding to 
death several women and. girls gathered around and commenced sharpening 
their knives on stones preparatory to skinning the animal, which they proceeded 
to do as soon as the deer were dead. Engineer Meyers photographed the herd. 
At 4:15 on the morning of the 25th the ship was gotten under way and we 
started northward. After proceeding about 20 miles we ran into a large field of 
floating ice. The sun was shining brightly. Off upon the western horizon, 
clear-cut against the sky, glistening and sparkling in their covering of snow, 
were the Siberian mountains, while all around us, as far as the eye could reach, 
were great masses of heavy ice, rubbing and grinding against,one another. We 
were six hours steaming through thisice. While in the ice the captain shot 
‘three, and secured two, hcoded seal. Great numbers of waterfowl were in the 
open spaces among the ice. 2 
It was here that the whaling bark Sappho was crushed and sunk in 1882, and 
the barks Rainbow and Napoleon in 1885,and the bark Ladoga in 1889. . This last 
vessel escaped destruction and was repaired. Just to the northward, between 
pe ad ne destination, St. Lawrence Island, in 1885 the bark Gazelle was crushed. 
- and sunk. 
On Saturday afternoon, June 28, we sighted the snow-covered coast of St. Law- 
’ rence Island, and dropped anchor off the village Chib-u-chak on the northwest 
corner of the island. We are now in latitude 64 degrees north. The sun rises 
at 1:55 o’clock and sets at 10:05 p.m. Temperature at noon 40 degrees. This is 
the largest island in Bering Sea. It was discovered and named by Bering’s ex- 
_ pedition in the summerof 1728. In 1775 the island was sighted by Captain Cook 
and named Clark Island. On the 10th of July, 1817, it was visited by Kotzebuej’s 
expedition in thé Rurik, and in 1830 by Etolin in command of the brig Chicagof. 
Etolin found five native villages on the island. In 1878 the island was the scene 
ofagreat tragedy. Starvation and pestilence carried away over 400 of the people.

EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1271 — 
When the revenue cutter visited the island in 1880 not a man, woman, or child 
was left to tell the tale. In four villages the corpses of the population alone 
were found. All the villages on the island with the single exception of Chib-u- 
chak had been swept out of existence. 4 
In 1884 Capt. Healy reports, ‘‘At the villages along the north shore no sign of 
living beings could be found, but the still decaying bodies of the unfortunate 
Eskimos were lying in and about the falling houses.” ; 
Before we dropped anchor four or five umniaks, loaded with natives, were 
-waiting to board us. As soon as the anchor went down they paddled up tothe ~

gangway,and from sixty to seventy men, women, and children came aboard, pre- 
pared to barter walrus tusks, ivory carvings, fur clothing, native boots and shoes, 
seal skin, ete. The women were more highly tattooed than any we have before 
met. As the captain wished to take the census of the village he had to goacross — 
to Indian Point (Cape Tchapalin), Siberia, for an interpreter. 
It was a five-hours run. We reached Indian Point about 6 o’clock in the 
~ morning. The natives were soon off in force with the usual things for barter, 
and a few to secure the services of the ship’s physician. The village consisted 
of some 2 dozen skin tents, also a few underground huts and one small frame 
house. Above the tide on the beach along the whole front of the village lay

_ the unbroken ice and snow. The village itself is on alow sandspit that pro- 
jects out into the sea. The mountains back and above the village were covered 
with snow, and even while we were anchored there, a driving snow storm was 
sweeping over them. Small cakes of floating ice were drifting around the vessel. 
Going ashore, I was greatly impressed with the number of the children. In 
all the journey I have not met so largeanumber. Being in Russia, our Alaskan 
‘school system can not reach them. They are an Eskimo colony, speaking the 
same language as the natives of St. Lawrence Island. Perhaps they could be 
induced +o remove over there for the sake of schooling their children. 
- At Indian Point we had eider ducks for dinner, and found them good eating. 
. Securing an interpreter, Tommy Tough by name, the captain, on the morning of 
June 30, returned to St. Lawrence Island. On our way across, although an al- 
lowance of 5 miles had been made for the current, the vessel was carried 10 
miles farther out of its course, making adrift of 15 miles in a distan¢e of 40. A 
dense fog having set in, the ship passed north of the ‘island without seeing it. 
The fog lifting at 10:30 a. m., we retraced our course and soon after dropped 
anchor abreast of the village, and I went ashore with Lieut. Dimock, Dr. Holmes, 
and the interpreter. 
The houses are from 20 to 40 feet insize. For a distance of 5 or 6 feet above 
the ground the walls are built of driftwood, whalebone, or timbers and planks 
from shipwrecked vessels. These are placed on end side by side, forming an 
inclosure in a circularor oblong form. The cracks between these planks are 
stuffed with moss. From the top of these walls rafters made of poles are ex- 
tended across, meeting inthe center. These are supported in the center by a 
ridge pole resting upon posts. These rafters are covered with walrus and seal 
skins, forming the roof. Some roofs are in the shape of a cone and others of a 
dome. Inside they are partitioned off around the sides with deer skin curtains. 
The spaces curtained oft form the sleeping places. All around, inside and out- 
side, are filth, dirt, sleds, spears, snowshoes, and household utensils. The a houses and tents are located with no reference to order or street lines. The 
sleds are shod with bone. Ona few small ones, the whole runner was made of a 
walrus tusk. 
If the building is a very large one there is a row of supporting poles on each 
side, midway between the center and sides. Over the rafter polesare stretched 
walrus hides. ‘These are held in position by rawhide ropes, attached to which 
and hanging down the sides of the building are the vertebra of whales, large 
_ stones, and old iron from shipwrecked vessels. This anchorage both stretches 
the skins and preyents them from being blown off. These skins being trans- 
lucent let in a great deal of light. Thereareno windows in the house, and buta 
small opening, from 2 to 24 feet above the ground, for a door. Fire, when they 
have any, is made on the dirt floor in the center of the room. Each building 
is occupied by several families. Near the house is a scaffold made of posts of the 
jaw bones of the whale. These are 7 to 10 feet high and 10 feet wide. A series 
ofthese make the scaffolds from 20to 30 feetlong. On these are placed the skin 
boats, harness of the dogs, meat, etc.,so.as to be out of the reach of dogs. Upon 
one of these, attached to the whale bone cross beam, was a child’s swing made 
of walrus thong rope. 
I saw several exeavations where underground houses had once been, and one 
such house still standing with the roof partially fallen in. Thesides were com- 
posed of walrus skulls laid up like a New England stone wall. In this house 
were some corpses, together with the spear and arrowheads and personal be- 
longings of the dead. 
Large patches of snow and ice still remain in the village, some of them being 
from 3 to 4 feet deep. As we passed from house to house we were followed by a 
crowd of dirty, but bright-looking children. From the eldest to the child which 
was just able to talk, they asked for tobacco, which is used by both sexes and all 
ages down to the nursing child. Five little girls, from 4 to 10 years of age, gave 
me anative dance. They commenced with a swinging motion of the body from 
side to side, throwing their weight alternately upon each foot. This was accom- 
panied by an explosive grunt, or squeak, as if the air was being violently expelled 
from the lungs. As they warmed up, they whirled around, writhed and twisted 
their bodies and distorted their faces into all manner of shapes and expressions, 
until they would fall down with dizziness. 
The census revealed a total population of 270, of whom 70 were boys and 55 
girls, living in 21 houses. This is a good village for aschool. One established 
here ought to draw to it some families from Indian Point, Siberia. They are 
the same people, and the two villages are about 40 miles apart. During the 
summer of 1891 the Reformed Episcopal Missionary Society will establish a mis- 
sion school at this village. :

KING ISLAND. 
Returning the interpreter to Indian Point, the captain steamed away for 
- King Island, which we reached about5 p.m.on July 1. This is one of the most 
remarkable settlements in America. The island is a great mass of basalt rock, 
about a mile in length, rising from the sea with perpendicular sides from 700 to 
1,000 feet above the water. On the south side the wall is broken down by a ra- 
vine rising at an angel of 45 degrees, and is filled with looserock. A great, per- 
manent snow bank filled the bottorn of the ravine from the water to the top of 
the mountain. On the west side of the snow is the village of Ouk-i-vak, which 
consists of some 40 dwellings or underground houses, partly excavated in the 
side of the hill, and built up with stonewalls. Across the top of these walls are 
large poles made from the driftwood that is caught floating around the island. 
Upon these are placed hides and grass, which are in turn covered with dirt. A~ 
low tunnel or dirt-covered hallway, 10 to 15 feet long, leads directly under the 
center of the dwelling. This is so low that we had to stoop and often creep in 
entering. At the end of the hall directly overhead is a hole about 18 inches in 
diameter. This is the entrance to the dwelling above. 
Frequently in summer, these caves become too damp to live in. The people 
then erect a summer house upon top of the winter one. The summer house 
of walrus hides, stretched over a wooden frame, making a room from 
10 to 15 feet square. These summer houses are guyed to rocks with rawhide 
ropes, to prevent them from being blown off into the sea. The entrance is an 
oval hole inthe walrus hide, about 2 feet above the floor. Outside of the door is 
a narrow platform about 2 feet wide, leading back to the side of the hill. Some 
of these platforms are from 15 to 20 feet above the roofs of the huts below them. 
Across the ravine from the village, at the base of the perpendicular sides of the 
island is a cave, into the mouth of which the surf dashesand roars. Atthe back 
of the cave is a large bank of perpetual snow. Ontheside of the mountainabove 
there is a perpendicular shaft{rom 80 to 100 feet deep, leading down into the 
cave. Thiscave is the storehouse for the whole village. Walrus and seal meat 
is. dropped down the shaft, and then stored away in rooms excavated in the snow. 
As the temperature in the cave never rises above freezing point, meat so stored 
soon freezes solid and keeps indefinitely. The women gain entrance to their 
storehotise by letting themselves down the shaft, hand over hand, along a raw- 
hide rope. 
Capt. Healy had a census taken with the following result: Total population 
200, of whom 33 were males and 45 females under 21 years of age. Here, as at 
the other native villages, I secured a number of articles of interest for the mu- 
seum of natural history and ethnology at Sitka. . :    
THE WHALING FLEET. 
At 3:15 a. m. on the 2d of July the ship anchored at Port Clarence, in the 
midst of the Arctic whaling fleet. Hightsteamers and.cighteen sailing vessels, 
all flying the American flag, were an inspiring sight in this far off, uninhabited 
bay ; almost within the Arctic Circle; and the more so, as a few months ago, in 
Washington, I heard a gentleman who had just returned from a trip-around the 
world, say in a public address that in all his trip, he had seen but one vessel fly- 
ing the Stars and Stripes. Many of the whalersleave San Francisco in January, 
and it is their custom to gather at this point about the Ist of July before enter- 
ing the Arctic Ocean, to meet a steamer sent from San Francisco with a fresh 
supply of provisions, coal, etc. 
Soon after anchoring, the captains of the whalers began arriving in order to 
get their mail, for the captain of the revenue steamer, among other good offices 
for humanity, bringsup the yearly mail for the 2,000 whalers, traders, teachers, 
and missionaries, and whoever else may be living in the Arctic regions of the 
United States. For those who have had no tidings from their loved onesat home 
or returns from an important business transaction, the coming of the revenue 
steamer is an important event. Great bundles of letters and papers were piled 
upon the captain’s table, and again and again they were carefully scanned, each 
captain picking out those that belonged to himself or his crew. Some of them 
did this so nervously, that though they personally looked over the packet three 
or four different times, they still missed some, which would be detected and 
handed out by some one foliowing. 
A few visiting Eskimos were camped upon the beach, some of them being 
dressed in bird instead of deer skins.    
-P-A-G-E-682

1274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. - 
The day before we arrived the mate of one of the vessels had died, and an offi- 
‘cer on another vessel was very sick, dying a few weeks afterwards. In a fleet 
with hundreds of sailors are some accidental cuts, bruises, etc., so that there were 
many calls for the professional services of the Government physician. This is 
another feature of the beneficent work of the revenue steamer. In Arctic 
Alaska in summer are 2,000 sailors on the whalers, a hundred traders and thou- 
sands of natives, covering an area of tens of thousands of square miles, and no 
physician except the one carried around on the annual cruise of this vessel. 
The value of such services can not be estimated. 
During our stay at Port Clarence Capt. Healy, in the discharge of his official 
duty, as usual, sent officers on board of every vessel to search for liquors. The 
large majority of the captains of the whaling vessels are*opposed to the trading 
- of liquors to the natives forfurs; but there are some who believe in it, and boldly 
say that if the cutter did not come and search them they would engage in it, 
and that they do engage in it on the Siberian caast, where the cutter has no 
jurisdiction. The result of the search was that 11 barrels of alcohol and 6 cases 
of gin were seized upon one schooner and emptied into the ocean. One captain, 
seeing the officer coming, emptied a barrel of liquor over the side of his vessel 
and threw three gallon cans after it. The cans, instead of sinking, floated by the 
searching officer. He, doubtless thinking them empty kerosene cans, did not take 
the trouble to pick them up. During the past ten years hundreds of barrels of 
vile liquors have been emptied into the sea as the result of the vigilance of Capt. 
Healy and the officers of the revenue cutter. The amount of crime, suffering, 
and destitution thus prevented can not be overestimated. The country and all 
who are interested in saying the natives of this coast from the demoralization 
of rum owe a large debt of gratitude to Capt. Healy, who has practically broken 
: up the traffic on this northwest coast. 
One of the captains reported acase of assault and battery with intent to kill. On 
the 30th of June his steward had dangerously wounded one of the sailors, cutting 
with a razor a gash 83 incheslong and totheribsindepth. The steward had been 
in irons ever since. It was a small schooner and“there was no suitable place for 
keeping the prisoner, who had threatened to kill the mate and fire the ship whenhe 
regained his liberty. Under the circumstances the captain was very anxious to get 
rid of him, and wrote Capt. Healy,as the nearest Government official, an urgent 
letter asking him to take the manoffhishands. Thisis another phase of the many- 
sided work of a Government cutter in this vast land without lawor courts. The 
steward being equally anxious to claim the protection of the Government, he 
was brought alongside in irons. The irons were taken off and he was assigned 
work. The commanding officers of all the revenue vessels visiting these out- 
lying portions of the eountry should be clothed with the powers of a justice of 
the peace, so that offenses could be investigated, testimony taken, and offenders 
arrested and bound over for trial at the United States district court at Sitka. 
As it is, the captain could not legally have taken this man against his will, and 
when the vessel arrives at San Francisco the man can go ashore a free man, 
escaping not only all punishment, but even an official investigation. : 
In the harbor awaiting our arrival was the schooner Oscar and Hattie, Capt. 
J. J. Haviside master, laden with building material and supplies for the school- 
houses at Cape Prince of Wales, Point Hope, and Point Barrow. The schooner 
got under way that same afternoon for Cape Prince of Wales, about 30 miles 
distant. Upon the following day the schooner Jennie arrived with supplies for 
the whalers. She had on board the four teachers, Messrs. H. R. Thornton and 
W.T. Lopp for Cape Prince of Wales, Dr. John B. Drigg for Point Hope, and 
Mr. L. M. Stevenson for Point Barrow. At midnight we witnessed one of those 
gorgeous sunsets for which the Pacific coast is so famous. 
On the morning of the 4th of July all the vessels ‘‘dressed ship” in honor of 
the day. At8 o'clock a.m. we got under way, reaching Cape Prince of Wales 
at 1:25 p.m. The captain very kindly sent Prof. Thornton and myself ashore at 
once, and we celebrated the 4th of July, 1890, by locating at this extreme west- 
_ ernend of the western hemisphere the site and laying the foundations of the 
_ first schoolhouse and mission on the Arctic coast of Alaska. From this school is 
visible to the north, the Arctic Ocean; to the south, Bering Sea, and to the west, 
Bering Straits, the coast of Siberia, and Diomede Islands. The cape is a bold 
promontory crowned with groups of needle rocks. As we had a teacher on 
board, we could trace the resemblance of one group to a teacher and pupils. 
Back of the coast the mountain peaks rise to the height of 2,596 feet. At the 
base of the promontory is a low sand spit, upon which is built the native village 
of King-e-gan. This school is one of the contract schools of the U. S. Bureau 
of Education and is in charge of the American Missionary Association of the

Congregational Church. The money needed for its establishment was contrib- 
uted by the Congregational Church of Southport, Conn., Rey. William H. Hol- 
man, pastor. 
At Port Clarence volunteers were called for and through the courtesy of the 
several captains the following carpenters offered their services without pay in 
the erection of the schoolhouses at Cape Prince of Wales and Point Hope: Charles 
Johnson, of the steam bark Zhrasher; James Hepburn, of the Balena; Edward E. 
Norton, of the Orca, and A.S. Curry, of the Grampus. Capt. Healy sent off 2 
carpenters and 10 or 12 men from the Bear. 
While the house was building Capt. Healy took the ship over to(Krusenstern) 
Little Diomede Island to take the census of Imach-leet. Upon our arrival it 
was storming so badly that he was compelled to continue on over to the Asiatic 
side for a safe anchorage. On the third day, the storm having abated, we 
started for Imach-leet, calling at Hast Cape on our way. We also passed close 
to Inug-leet, on Ratmanoff Island, but did not go on shore. 
Bering Straits, which separate the American and Asiatic continents, are 40 
miles broad. These straits were first passed by Capt. Bering in August, 1728, 
who demonstrated the fact that Asia was separated from America. It remained 
for Capt. Cook, in August, 1778, to complete Bering’s discoveries and give to 
the world the exact relations of the continents to each other. Nearly in the 
center are Big and Little Diomede (Ratmanoff and Krusenstern) islands. The 
former belongs to Russia, and the latter to the United States. “As these islands 
- are only 2 miles apart, Russia and the United States are here close together. 
Imach-leect, like Inug-leet and Ouk-i-vak, is built upon the steep side of a” 
mountain, and is the filthiest place yet visited. Being so close to the Asiatic 
settlements, it is the gateway of much of the liquor smuggled into this section 
of Alaska. A school with an efficient teacher at this place would prevent much 
of this illicit traffic and accomplish a great work. 
As we returned to King-e-gan we sailed close to Fairway Rock, the Indian 
name of which is Oo-ghe-e-ak, and is said to signify, ‘‘ Thanks to God,” because 
there is room to shelter two native boats which may be overtaken in this part 
of the sea by a storm. Fairway Rock is a quarter of a mile in circumference 
and from 300 to 400 feet high. It is one of the natural danger-signal stations of 
Bering Sea and the Arctic, being occupied by myriads of birds, which, by their 
continual cries in thick and foggy weather, warn the navigator of his proximity 
to the rock. 
At King-e-gan the captain picked up his carpenters and sailors, who had fin- 
ished the school building, and on the afternoon of July 12 we started northward 
through Bering Straits into the Arctic Ocean. Twenty-four hours later we 
crossed the Arctic Circle and were in ‘the land of the midnight sun.” 
July 13 Capt. Healy anchored off Schishmareff Inlet to take the census. At 
the time of Capt. Beechey’s expedition in 1826 there was a large native village 
here. Now it is reduced to a very small number 
In visiting the camp upon shore I came across the oldest-looking native that 
_ Ihave seen this season. A number of the natives visited theship. Wild ducks 
were so plentiful that the captain bought acouple of dozen for the table at the rate 
of a cent apiece. The next morning we anchored off Cape Blossom, in Kotzebue 
Sound. This sound was discovered on the Ist of August, 1816, by Capt. Kotzebue, 
in command of the Ruwrik, fitted out by Count Romanoff, of Russia, to discover 
- the northwest passage. In September, 1826, it was visited by Capt. Beechey in 
» the British ship Blossom, who was codperating with Sir John Franklin, Frank- 
lin working from the eastern side toward the west, and Beechey from the western 
side eastward. The two expeditions failed to make connection. While in the 
sound Capt. Beechey buried a cask of flour. In July, 1850, the ships Herald, 
Capt. Hellett, Plover, Capt. Moore, and the Investigator, sent by the British Ad- 
miralty in search of Sir John Franklin, and the schooner yacht: Nancy Dawson, 
under her owner, Robert Shedder, visited the sound. The flour buried nearly 
a quarter of a century before was found in good condition, and a dinner party 
given, at which were cakes and pies made from it. In Eschscholtz Sound, the 
southwest arm of Kotzebue Sound, are clitis from 20'to 80 feet in height, which 
rise into hills between 400 and 500 feet above the sea. “ 
At the time of Kotzebue’s visit this cliff was supposed to be an immense ice- 
berg, covered with a foot of soil and grass, but was found by Capt. Beechey to 
be frozen earth. The interesting feature of the cliff is that it contains a large 
deposit of fossil ivory, mammotk tusks, teeth, and bones. I secured portions of 
two mammoth tusks and two teeth. 
One afternoon Lieut. Buhner and myself started to visit some of the native 
villages. After going about 15 miles we got on the shoals and were compelled     
-P-A-G-E-685
     
a ’ EDUCATION IN ALASKA. - - 1277 
to return to the ship. While absent we landed and visited some native graves. 
There is arow of them extending for miles along the beach. As there is a 
frozeu subsoil, rendering it very difficult to dig graves, the dead are wrapped 
up in seal skins, which are securely tied and then deposited above the ground 
in the forks of poles or elevated platforms so high above the earth that the wild 
animals can not reach them. 
The whole landscape out from under the snow was covered with beautiful 
wild flowers, and we were covered with mosquitoes that swarmed around us in 
clouds. .Wesaw very few natives on the beach, they being largely at Sheshalik, 
on the north side of Hotham Inlet. When theice leaves Kotzebue Sound in the 
summer the beluga, or white whale, comes in, and the natives come down the 
rivers by hundreds from the interior to hunt him and later on to barter with the 
coast tribes. About the middle of July the run of the whales is over, and that 
of the salmon commences on the Cape Blossom side of the inlét. The popula- 
tion then change their tents from the north to the south side of the inlet. In 
the mean time the Alaskan and Siberian coast natives are arriving day b, 
day, until in August from 1,500 to 2,500 people are gathered on the spit nort! 
of Cape Blossom, fishing and trading. This is the great international annual 
fair and market of Arctic Alaska. 
The natives of the interior here barter their beautiful furs with the natives of 
the coast for sealoil, walrus hides, and seal skins, and with the natives of Si- 
beria for reindeer skins, whisky,and breech-loading firearms, cartridges, etc. 
Formerly these gatherings were visited by schooners, fitted out at San Fran- 
cisco and Sandwich Islands, with cargoes of liquor in bottles labeled ‘‘ Florida 
“Water,” ‘‘ Bay Rum,” “‘ Pain Killer,” ‘‘Jamaica Ginger,” etc. This traffic has 
largely ®een broken up by the visits of the revenue cutters. 
A schooner was at anchor off Cape Blossom when wearrived. Seeing the cut- 
ter it weighed anchor and sailed away, but not before an officer had been sent on 
bgard to search her. Although no unusual supply of liquor was found on board, 
yet that afternoon a native and his wife were found drunk from liquor received. 
from this vessel. They were brought aboard the cutter, testified where they se- 
cured the liquor, received a reprimand, and upon the promise of not drinking 
again, were let 
On the north side of the sound is the entrance fo Hotham Inlet into which 
empty two large rivers, the Kowak and the Noatak. Although the existence of 
these rivers was known in a vague way by reports from native sources, they were 
first explored and mapped in 1883, 1884,.and 1885 by expeditions fitted out by 
Capt. Healy, commanding the Corwin. As the larger number of natives whom [ 
wished tosee had not yet arrived the captain concluded to go on and fulfill his 
duties farther north and return here before the people should separate, conse- 
quently, on the morning of the 16th, with a fair wind, hesailednorthward. We 
were soon abreast of Cape Krusentern, where, in July, 1886, the John Carver was 
crushed in the ice. On the morning of the 17th we dropped anchor off Cape 
Thompson to water ship. The ship’s boats were taken ashore and filled with 
fresh water from a creek. The boats were then rowed back to the ship and the 
water pumped from them into the ship’stanks. By noon the tanks were full and 
we had on board’a month’s supply of water. In the afternoon the sailors were 
allowed to go ashore and wash their clothes. Soon after anchoring the natives 
began to come on board and the deck was covered with them all day. 
Cape Thompson is a bold, rocky bluff 1,200 feet high. It is a remarkable cliff 
geologically, showing a great fold of the earth’s crust. The face of the cliffis 
also a great bird rookery, birds by the thousand and tens of thousands nesting in 
the cracks and upon the projections of the rocks. Wishing some egg shells a 
party of natives were hired for a few crackers toget some eggs. Taking a rope 
with them, they scaled the cliffs, and letting one of their number down the faco 
of the precipice with the rope he soon gathered two bushelsand a half of eggs. 
Leaving Cape Thompson at 5 o’clock p. m. we reached Point Hope about 11 p, 
m., and dropped anchor in the midst of twelve vessels, largely belonging to the 
New Bedford whaling fleet. The captain immediately dispatched a boat for 
mail to the bark Thomas Pope that had come up from San Francisco with sup- 
plies to the whalers from New Bedford. In due time the boat returned with a 
batch of papers as late as June 10, but noletters. It then being nearly midnight 
I concluded to remain up and see the midnightsun, which dipped about half way 
into the water and then commenced to rise again. Atthe setting it was partially 
obscured by a cloud, but the ng was cloudless and beautiful. 
Point Hope is a narrow stretch of land extending out into the Arctic Ocean, 
some 16 miles from the general line of the coast. This gives it its native name 
Tig-e-rach (Finger.) It has evidently been’ formed by two great fields of ice _

  grounding on the bottom and pushing the sand in a ridge before them, until the 
ridge rises above the ocean. Between these parallel ridges is a lake extendin, 
nearly the entire length of the peninsula. Formerly the cape extended stil! 
farther into the ocean, but one year the ice pack came along with such force as 
to cutthe end off, sweeping away with it a number of underground houses. 
For three days we lay at anchor riding outasouthern gale. Tendayslater (July 
28), at the same place, ina similar storm, the Thomas Pope, having not yet fin- 
ished discharging her freight was driven into the breakers and wrecked, and 
her crew was received on board the revenue cutter by Capt. Healy. On Mon- 
day, July 21, the storm having abated, the ship was moved nearer the village _ 
and I went ashore to inspect the school building, which was in process of erec- 
tion by Capt. Haviside and the volunteering carpenters who had preceded us 
from Cape Prince of Wales, where Capt. Healy had remained to finish up 
the work on that school building. Capt. Healy sent hiscarpenterand a num- 
ber of sailors.on shore toassist inthe work. By night the building was finished 
and ready for occupancy. Thisis thesecond of our newschools inthe ‘Arctic. > It 
is a contract school under the supervision of the Mission Society of the Prot- 
estant Episcopal Church. The teacher is John B. Driggs,M.D. The advisa- 
_ bility of the establishment of a school at this point was represented to me last 
fall by Lieut. Commander Charles H. Stockton, U.S. Navy, who had just re- 
turned from a eruise on this coast. Bringing the matter to-the attention of 
Hon. W. T. Harris, Lu. D., United States Commissioner of Education, and 
through him to the honorable Secretary of the Interior, I had the privilege of 
securing the establishment of schools for the Arctic Eskimo at that place. 
While at Point Hope I visited the native village, butfew of the people being ~ 
home. Ialso visited the cemetery; the dead, tied up in deer and walmms skin 
_ blankets, are laid on platforms above the reach of dogs and wild beasts. The 
present population is about 300. But in the year 1800, when this was the lead- 
ing tribe on the Arctic coast, the village is supposed to have had a population 
of about2,000. In that yeartheir power was broken by a greatland and sea fight 
near Cape Seppings, between them and the Nooatoks of the interior. In this 
disastrous battle their leading hunters being killed, a famine set in which car- 
ried away half of the remaining inhabitants. During the day a number of na- 
tives came on board. Amdng them were three from Cape Prince of Wales. 
Last winter while out on the ice after seals, the ice broke loose from the shore 
and floated out to sea, carrying them with it. They were on the ice drifting 
helplessly about in the Arctic Ocean for a month or six weeks, when the floe 
finally went ashore at Cape Thompson, 150 miles north of where they started 
from. The party of five were.reduced to the greatest straits for food, even eat- 
ing up their boots. One died on the ice, and a second soon after landing, leay- 
ing three to be returned on the cutter to their friends and homes. Last winter 
two men on the ice hunting were drifted away from this place and have never 
been heard from. 
Four ships have been wrecked here in late years. The Louisa and the bark 
‘John Howland in 1883; the Thomas Pope in 1890, and the Little Ohio in 1888. In 
connection with the latter wreck, the officers and 30men were drowned. Among 
those that were saved was a sailor, who took a position at the whaling station. 
Last winter while en route from Cape Lisburne coal mines to Point Hope, he 
froze his feet so badly that mortification set in. Upon the arrival of the Bear 
he was received on board for medical attendance, and his toes were amputated 
by the surgeon. 
In 1887 a San Francisco firm established a whaling station several miles from 
the village, the influence of which has been demoralizing. The natives are now 
recruiting their numbers by purchasing children from the interior tribes,which 
children, as they grow up, become a part of the tribe. The market price fora 
child isa seal skin bag of oil, or a suit of old clothes. 
Having attended to everything that was necessary at Point Hope, and paid 
off the natives who assisted in the erection of the schoolhouse, our mail was 
sent over to the Thomas Pope, which was soon to sail for San Francisco, and at 
10 o’clock a.m. on the 22d of July we sailed north with a fair wind, passing 
Cape Lisburne at 1:35 p.m. From Cape Lisburne the. coast turns to the east- 
ward at almost a right angle, the general trend being to the northeast until 
Point Barrow, the most northern limit of the continent, is reached. Cape Lis- 
burne, 849 feet high, is a bold bluff of flint and limestone, abounding with fossil 
shells and marine animals. It is also in its season a noted rookery for birds. 
- The immediate vicinity is said to be the flower garden of the Arctic (Koog- 
Moote) on account of the number and variety of the wild flowers. From Cape 
Lisburne there is a uniform descent and breaking down of the hills for 50 miles

to Cape Beaufort. At Cape Beaufort is the last point where the hills reach the 
coast. Soon after leaving the cape, the ice has pushed up the sand, forming a 
shingle or outer coast, running parallel with the real coast. This outer coast is 
a strip of sand with a varying width of 900 to 1,000 feet, about 6 feet above the 
level of the sea, and extending 120 miles north. The body of water inclosed be- 
tween the two coastsisfrom2to6miles wide. From Cape LisburnetoCape Beau- — 
fort are extensive coal mines, at which some of the steam whalers replenish their 
exhausted supplies. This season over 500 tons have been mined by the whalers. 
At Cape Beaufort the geological formation is sandstone, inclosing petrified 
wood and rushes, with veins of coal. Drift coal was found on the beach almost

up to Point Barrow. During the night the wind gradually grew stronger until 
towards morning, when we encountered a heavy southwest gale, causing the 
ship to roll until it was almost impossible to keep in bed. 
At 11 o’clock a, m., on the 24th of July, we were in the midst of floating ice, 
and at noon anchored off Cape Collie. Soon the musquitoes began to swarm on 
board, and the captain moved his anchorage farther out to sea. 
We were again in the midst of the whaling fleet, and at the edge of the ice. 
pack which prevented farther progress to the north. The Arctic “* pack” is the 
name given to that large body of perpetual solid ice in the Arctic Ocean extend- 
ing from the coast of Alaska across to Siberia. Its southern limit is constantly

    ADB“: EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
changing with the severity of the season, and the course of winds and currents. 
Its southern edge is also irregular, sometimes containing openings or canals ex- 
_ tending into the pack for miles, these are called ‘‘leads.’’ A wider and shorter 
opening is called a ‘‘ pocket.” 
In August, 1778, Capt. Cook found the southern edge of the pack coe 
on Icy Cape, 40 miles south of our present anchorage. It was a compact wal 
of ice, 10-feet above the water and from 70 to 90 feet under the surface, extending 
west of north and east by south, from continent to continent. In 1826 Capt. 
Beechey did not meet it until near Cape Smyth, 120 miles farther north. 
August 20, 1879, the fleet reached the pack at Blossom Shoals, off Icy Cape. 
August 10, 1885, the pack was at our present anchorage. Cape Collie is at the 
north side of the entrance to Wainwright Inlet, an extensive lagoon into which 
_ empties aconsiderable river from theinterior. After lunch I accompanied Lieut. 
_ Dimock and the interpreter ashore, on a visit to the native village of Koog-moote. 
On account of the shore ice making out some distance from the beach, we had great. 
difficulty in landing and still greater dangerinembarkingagain. Along theouter 
edge was a mass of detached pieces of ice that under the influence of the waves 
were bobbing up and down and constantly shifting their position. The greatest, 
eare had to be taken lest our small boatshould be caughtand crushed. And when 
we got upon the ice and attempted to make our way from one cake to another the 
peril was still greater. Although our heads and faces were covered with mus- 
quito netting, the little insects managed to get inside and make our stay ashore 
atorment. Arctic ptarmigan were abundant. The first party of natives we 
met were cating reindeer meat. Taking alarge chunk in the left hand and 
fastening upon it with the teeth, a knife held in the right hand was passed up- 
ward close to the mouth, severing a piece as large as could be conveniently 
chewed. I think a beginner at this method of carving meat would:slice off the 
end of his nose. 
I counted twelve underground huts in the village, none of which were occu- 
pied. Tho larger portion of the people were inland hunting reindeer. The 
few remaining at the village were living in tents, their winter houses being 
partly filled with water. While on shore I walked out on the ice te the hull of 
the George & Susan. This bark was wrecked on the 10th of August, 1885, to- 
gether with the Mabel. Three of the crew were drowned in getting ashore, and 
some of thos? that escaped were in an exceedingly critical condition for several 
hours after they were rescued by Capt. Healy and taken aboard of the revenue 
cutter Corwin, which was anchored in the neighborhood. 
Early on July 25 we started in search of the ‘‘ice pack,” which we found 5 
miles away. After skirting the pack a short distance, the captain returned in 
shore and anchored off Point Belcher. At this point is another small village 
(She-rah-rack) of twelve winter hunts, which I visited. But three or four fam- 
ilies,remained in the place, the others being off hunting the reindeer. 
On July 26 it snowed nearly all day. At1lp.m. the captain again started 
out to examine the condition of the ice. After skirting the edge of the pack 
for some distance we returned and anchored of Cape Franklin. In the after- 
noon the captain changed his anchorage a few miles north, off Sea Horse Is- 
lands. While lying here at anchor Capt. Healy secured for me two nests and 
eggs of the eider duck. 
We are now in the midst of the Arctic graveyard of ships. In the last 20 
years from 75 to 80 vessels connected with the whale trade have been wrecked 
on the American side of the Arctic coast, and from 15 to 20 on the Asiatic 
side. In 1871 83 ships were caught in the ice near here and abandoned, and 
1,200 sailors were cast helplessly on this sterile coast, with an insufficient 
supply of provisions, and for 100 miles the ice pack was solid between them and 
escape. There was then no refuge station at Point Barrow, but fortunately 
they were able to get-south along the coast until they met some ships that took 
them off. Again, in 1876, 13 whaling vessels were caught in the ice off these 
same Sea Horse Islands and drifted helplessly to the north of Point Barrow, 
where they were abandoned. To the northward the Daniel Webster was crushed 
in the ice in 1881, the steamer North Star in 1882, and schooner Clara Light in 
1885. A little to the south of this point the bark John Howland was stove in by 
the ice off Point Lay in 1883, steamer Bow Head off Point Belcher in 1884, the 
Mabel and George and Susan off Point Collie. A little west of this point the 
bavks Mt. Wollaston and Vigilant were caught in the ice in 1879, and no tidings 
have ever come from vessels or crews. On the 8th of August, 1888, the barks 
Fleetwing, Young Phenix, Mary and Susan, and schooner Jane Gray were lost in 
the ice off Point Barrow, 160 of their crew being rescued by Capt. Healy, who 
was in the vicinity. It is when a ship reaches the ice that extreme watchful-

ness and care is demanded ; the smallest change of wind, currents, or ice being 
noted and weighed, which means to the commanding officer days and‘nights of 
sleepless anxiety. It was in one of these seasons of anxiety that Capt. Healy 
spent 75 consecutive hours in the crow’s nest at the masthead, his food being 
taken up to him. 
On the 30th of July we were getting tired of our enforced delay. We had 
been a week off Point Belcher and Sea Horse Islands, waiting for the ice pack 
to swing off the shore and let us forward. That night, as we were upon deck 
watching the midnight sun, a large field of shore ice was seen drifting toward 
us. For a little the good ship held fast as the great cakes broke on her bow 
and ground against her sides; but by and by the pressure became too great and 
she dragged her anchor, and commenced drifting toward the shoals. Steam 
was at once raised, the anchor weighed, and the ship set at work bucking her 
way through the ice. Once under way the captain concluded to go on until 
again stopped by theice. Threading his way carefully through masses of float- 
ing ico, he reached and anchored on the morning of July 31 off the village of 
Ootkeayie, near Point Barrow. Upon communicating with the shore it was 
found that the ics had left two days previous, and that the first vessels had ar- 
rived a few hours before. Masses of ice were still floating by in the current and 
grounded icebergs lay between the ship and the beach. Ootkeavie, next to Cape 
Prince of Wales, is the largest village on the Arctic coast, numbering about 300 
people. In #881, 1882, and 1883 it was occupied as one of the stations of the In- 
ternational Polar Expedition. The house built by Lieut. P. H. Ray for the use 
of the expedition has been leased-to the Pacific Steam Whaling Company, and 
is used by them as a whaling station and trading post, the gentleman in charge 
being Mr. John W. Kelly, who has given the world an interesting monograph 
on the Arctic Eskimo, together with an Eskimo-English vocabulary. Both were 
published last spring by the United States Bureau of Education. This is also 
the location of the Government refuge station for shipwrecked whalers. 
Within the past 10 years some 2,000 sailors have been wrecked on this Arctic 
coast. So far they have been fortunate in finding vessels within reach to carry 
them south to civilization, but the occasion is liable to come any season when 
they will be compelled to winter here. This to a large body of men means slow 
starvation and death. They could not subsist on the country, and there is no 
adequate provision within 1,500 or 2,000 miles; and when the long Arctic winter 
sets in no power on earth could reach them with help. To provide against any 
such horrible tragedy Capt. Healy early saw the necessity of having an ample 
supply of provisions stored at some central place in the Arctic. The plangrew 
-and took shape in his own mind. _ He enlisted his friends and the men interested. 
in the whaling industry, particularly in New Bedford and San Francisco, and 
finally, after many vexatious delays that would have discouraged a less persist- 
ent man, Congress voted the money for the erection of the buildings and the 
procuring of the provisions. ” 
Last year Capt. Healy brought up the materials and erected the main build- 
ing, which is a low one-story building, 30 by 48 feet insize. The walls, roof; and 
floor are made double, as a protection against the intense cold of this high north- 
ern latitude in winter. It will accommodate 50 men comfortably; it can shelter 
100 if necessary.. The house has provisions for 100 men 12 months, and is ap- 
mirably adapted for its purpose. This year Capt. Healy had on board the ma- 
terial for the construction of a storehouse, also an additional supply of pro- 
visions, clothing, and coal. 
The Ootkeavie is one of the villages selected by the United States Bureau 
of Education for the establishment of a schoul, the contract for which was given 
by Dr. Harris to the Board of Home Missions of the PresbyterianChurch. The 
money necessary for its establishment was generously contributed by Mrs, 
Elliott F. Shepard, of New York. The teacher is Prof. L. M. Stevenson, of 
Versailles, Ohio, who reached the place on July 30, 1890. Owing to the short- 
ness of the time and the great distance from the source of supplies, and the 
dangers of Arctic navigation, I was able to secure material this season for only 
two of the school buildings and teachers’ residences to be erected in the Arctic. 
These were placed at Cape Prince of Wales and Point Hope. Next season I 
hope to erect one at Point Barrow. In the mean time, through the courtesy of 
Capt. Healy, representing the Treasury Department, I secured a room for the 
school in oneof the Government buildings. This is the most northern school in 
America, and with but oneexception in the world, being in latitude 71° 23’ north. 
At this point the trend of the continent turns to the eastward. However, on ~ 
this point the ice has pushed a low ridge of sand, which exlends from 8 to 10 
miles farther north. -On the end of this sand spit is a small village called Nu- 
ED 90. 81   
         
         
-P-A-G-E-690

wuk. On the sand spit midway between the villages is a hunting station, where ~ 
the natives congregate for weeks in summer to kill ducks, as they pass to and ~ 
fro from water to water over the sand spit. Thousands upon thousands are 
killed hereevery season. 
On the day of our arrival I spent the whole time on shore arranging for the 
school.' That evening the wind that had been freshening up all afternoon * 
increased toa gale, The barometer was going down, down, down ; heavy masses 
of icé were drifting by when the captain gave orders to weigh anchor and make 
a lee on the northeast side of Point Barrow, whither 16 vessels of the whaling 
fleet has preceded us. In asimilar storm last summer, shortly after the Bear 
left her anchorage at Ootkeavie, the ice came in and piled up 30 feet high on 
the very spot the vessel had left. The storm proved the severest we had en- 
countered this season, changing the configuration of the coastline for miles. 
At Ootkeavie, 20 tons of coal just landed for the use of the Government school, 
ee either swept out to sea or buried deep under the sand—no trace of it could 
ound. 
All day long, on the Ist of August, the gale howled and shrieked through the 
rigging, but the Bear rode it out in safety. In the evening a new danger pre- 
sented itself. It was found that the great ice pack, which was only 5 to 7 miles 
distant was closing in upon the shore, and soon we would be prisoners shut up 
-inanice trap. From this there would be no escape until the wind changed and 
drove the ice again off shore. This was the condition of things on August 1, 
1888. A number of the whalers had shifted,for protection, their anchorage 
from the westside of Point Barrow to the east side. The wind that had in- 
creased to a gale suddenly veered around from the southwest to the north, caus- 
ing a heavy sea to break upon the bar. At 9 o'clock that night, the schooner 
Jane Gray, parted her cables and drifted against an. iceberg—knocking a large 
hole in her side. She filled rapidly and sank, the crew taking tothe small | 
boats. The next toslip her moorings was the bark Pheniz. She struck the 
bar and sunk. Her crew drifted about in small boats for six hours in that terri- 
ble storm before they were picked up. Then the barks Mary and Susan, and . 
Fleetwing went on to the bar and pounded to pieces. Several other vessels 
parted their cables, sustaining more or less danger. 
In that fearful storm, when the waters of the Arctic were lashed into billows 
of foam, hurling masses of ice about like driving snow flakes, in the midst of 
snapping chains and crushing spars and tattered sails, when it seemed certain 
destruction to lower a small boat, the revenue cutter Bear rode the storm in 
safety, and her trained crew, under the direction of Cap. Healy, were venturing 
their lives and performing prodigies of valor in rescuing shipwrecked sailors. 
When the storm abated, 160 rescued men were on the decks of the Bear. On 
this occasion, fortunately for us, the storm abated before the ice reached us, 
seid August 2 gave us a beautiful afternoon, of which I availed myself to go | 
ashore. 
The western and northern coast of America terminates at Point Barrow in lati- 
tude 71° 23’ north and longitude 156° 10’ west. Beyond this the coast trends to 
the eastward and southward. .On the east side of the point is the native village 
of Nuwuk, which consists of a number of underground houses. Butfew families 
were home at the time of our visit, and they were mainly living in tentsoutside 
of their winter huts. The.first white man to visit this place was Master Elson, 
of H. M.S. Bossom (Capt Beechey’s expedition), in August, 1826. One hundred 
and forty-six miles to the eastward in Return Reef, the westernmost point reached 
by Sir John Franklin in his journey to form a junction with Capt. Beechey’s ex- 
pedition. The next visit by white men, was that of Capt. Simpson, of the Hudson 
Bay Company, who, in 1837, made the journey from the Mackenzie River. 
During the winters of 1852, 1853, and 1854 H. M.S. Plover wintered in Elson 
Bay to the east of the point. Now a United States revenue marine vessel and 
many whaling ships visit the place annnally. 
Soon after returning to the Bear from the village, the captain was visited 
by Capt. Sherman, of the steam whaler William Lewis, and informed that the 
tender of the New Bedford whaling fleet, the bark Thomas Pope, which we had 
left but a few days before at anchor at Point Hope, was wrecked in the breakers 
at that point, on the 28th of July, and that the crew wished to be received on 
board the Government vessel and taken back to civilization. Consent having 
béen obtained, the ten shipwrecked men were soon after sent onboard. As the 
captain had on board the Bear the materials for a Government storehouse at the 
Point Barrow refuge station, he concludéd to return at once to that place, and 
discharge his freight, that more comfortable quarters might be made for the. 
shipwrecked sailors.

The weather was beautiful, the ocean smooth, and the sail exhilarating. At 
midnight the sun was visible in the northwest, and the full moon in the south- 
eagt. At1atm., August 3, the ship anchored at Ootkeavie, where we remained. 
a week while the ship’s carpenters were building the Government storehouse, 
and the captain inspecting the refuge station. During the week, among the 
callers was Mr. J. B. Vincent, the hero of the shipwreck of the bark Napoleon, 
off the cost of Siberia. Mr. Vincent is now second, mate on the whaling bark 
Abram Barker. . 
One afternoon Capt. Gifford, of the bark Abram Barker, came.on board and 
represented that his engineer, a Russian, had made two or three attempts to dis- 
able the engine, upon which the safety of the ship depended, that he had the 
man in irons, and requested Capt. Healy to take him off his hands, as a dan- 
gerous character. The accused man himself joined in the request, and was re- 
-ceived on board. Thisis another instance of the many sided and anomalous 
character of the officers of a revenue vessel in these waters beyond the reach of 
courts and law. This is another instance where the commanding officer of the 
revenue service should have power to investigate, arrest, and commit criminals 
to the United States district court for trial. As it is,a man who endeayored to 
wreck a ship, and endangered many lives, goes free. é 
In 1882 Lieut. Ray’s party dug a well to the depth of 37.5 feet for observing 
the temperature of the earth. The entire distance was made through frozen 
sand and gravel. At the bottom of the shaft the temperature remained, win- 
ter and summer, uniformly at 12° F.. At thedepth of 20 feet a tunnel was runl0 - 
feet and then a room 10 by 12feet size excavated for a cellar. In this room the 
temperature never rises above 22°F. Birds and meat, placed in this room, 
freeze solid, and remain so until taken to the kitchen and thawed out for cook- 
ing. While at the station I descended into this unique storage house. The 
carcasses of several reindeer and dozens of eider ducks were taken from it, and 
presented to the ship, making a very welcome addition to our table fare. 
In the spring of 1883, 500 ducks werestored there at one time. At Ootkeavie 
the captain, at the request of the father, received on board a half-breed Eskimo 
boy, about 5 yearsof age, who is to be forwarded to the industrial training schoo’ 
at Sitka, for an education. I 
On Saturday, August 9, the inspection of the refuge station being completed, 
the storehouse finished, and arrangements forthe school perfected, preparations 
were made to return southward. At 4:10 p. m. the anchor was weighed and the 
vessel steamed north ‘a few miles to procure the last letters of the whaling fleet. 
The Stars and Stripes were hoisted to the top of the mainmast as a signal that 
we were about sailing. Soon after anchoring in the midst of the fleet the boats 
began arriving, bringing off packagesof letters. At 9:15 p. m.the flag was low- 
ered, the anchor weighed, and the Bear steamed slowly away en route to civili- 
zation. As we passed by the ships, one after another dipped their flags and 
bade us an Arctic farewell, with many wishes for a safe voyage. Great masses 
of heavy black clouds lay along the whole northern horizon, like a curtain to 
hide the unknown regions beyond. To the east of us lay the low land spit that 
marks the northern limit of the continent, the native village of underground 
huts, and the white canvas and skin covered tents of the visiting natives from 
the interior. To the west of us the sun was preparing, at 10 o’clock p. m., for a 
most gorgeous sunset; and south of us, as if symbolical of the lands of light, 
privilege, and comfort, to which we were to return, there was not a cloud to be 
seen in the beautiful sky. At 10o’clock p.m. we passed the school and refuge 
station, and soon they faded from sight and were left far behind us, in their 
Arctic solitude, until the Bear again visits them a twelvemonth hence. 
On the 11th of August the captain anchored off Cape Sabine to water ship. In 
this vicinity are extensive and valuable coal banks. On the beach were several 
deserters from the whaling ships, who begged hard to be received on board and 
taken out of the country. One of their number had been drowned. Every year 
men desert from the whalers; some of these die from exposure, others are’ 
picked up by the Bear, asin the present case, and a few remain in the country, 
descending at once to the level of the natives, demoralizing and doing them 
much more harm than a missionary can do good. 
On the 12th, in rounding Cape Lisburne in a gale, the jib boom and sailg were 
carried away, and the ship ran back and anchored in the lea of the cape. The 
country in the vicinity of the cape has been called the flower garden of the 
Arctic, on account of the number and variety of beautiful wild flowers. On the 
18th, although the storm had not fully subsided, the Bear was got under way, 
and that afternoon anchored by the hull of the wrecked Thomas Pope, abreast of 
the schoolhouse at Point Hope. I went ashore, but found the schoolhouse locked 
up, and Dr. Driggs, the teacher, absent.

1284, EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
On the morning of August 15, we bade good-by to Point Hope, and the fol- 
lowing morning, at 8:40 o'clock, dropped anchor off Cape Blossom, Kotzebue 
Sound. The day being pleasant I accompanied an officer to the great interna- 
tional fair of the Arctic, some 12 miles distant from ouranchorage. There were 
_ about 1,500 natives assembled from many and widely separated sections of the 
country—from Alaska and Siberia. Many were living in tents, but fully half 
had constructed shelters by turning their umiaks or boats upside down. As I 
passed their shelters, my attention was again and again called to the sick. To 
be sick beyond the reach of a physician, with poor care and poorer accommoda- 
tions, and without knowledge of even the commoner remedies, is distress itself. 
As I see these people, so kindly disposed in life, with a smile of welcome: to 
the stranger, and then see them languishing in their comfortless shelters, with 
but a few days or weeks removed from death, my heart goes out to them in inex- 
pressible longing, and I wish I could tell them the story of the Cross and ‘intro- 
duce them to the hopes and joys of the gospel. Perhaps I may, at no distant 
day. secure for their children a mission and boarding school. 
_. The beach was covered with racks, upon which hung long rows of salmon, 
drying for winter food. At 3:35 p. m., on the 27th, having a fair wind, the cap- 
tain weighed anchor and sailed for Cape Prince of Wales. On the afternoon of 
- the 19th, we passed through Bering Strait, and bade good-by to the Arctic 
Ocean. The sea was so rough that the captain gave up all hope of being able 
to land at the cape. But during the afternoon the wind died out and the sea 
calmed down, so that he was able to run in shore and anchor abreast of the vil- 
lage at 6 o’clock p.m. We could not have landed through the surf the day 
before, the day after, or at any other time that day. God’s providence stayed 
the waves sufficiently long for us to visit the shore and transact our business. 
Had we passed by without stopping the teachers would have been unable to 
send down their orders for the annual supply of provisions, and next year they 
would have been unsupplied. As it was I had four hours withthem. The wind 
increasing, at 10 o’clock we were again under way. On the 20th we steamed by 
King and Sledge islands (the sea being too rough to land), and at noon on the 
21st dropped anchor off St. Michael, Norton Sound. Soon after we had a call 
from Mr. Henry Newmann, agent of the Alaska Commercial Company, and Rey. 
William H. Judge, a Jesuit priest, who has lately come to the country to engage 
in the school work of the Roman Catholic Church on the Yukon River. 
St. Michael is located on the first good’ site for a trading post north of the 
delta of the Yukon River, and is the headquarters of the trade of the Yukon 
valley. To this point the furs collected at the trading posts in the interior, 
some of them 2,000 miles distant, are brought for reshipment to San Francisco. 
About half a mile from the trading post is a small native village. The trading 
post was established by the Russians in 1835, and is now occupied by the Alaska 
Commercial Company. A blockhouse and some of the original buildings are 
still standing. Through the courtesy of Mr. Henry Newmann, two small Rus- 
sian cannon, one of which was originally used in the defense of the place and the 
other in protecting the boating expeditions up the river, were s:cured for the 
‘collection of the Alaska Society of Natural History. ‘ At St. Michael 1 received 
a good account of the schools, nine of which receive their supplies and mails at 
“this point. 
It is said of one of the missionaries, who is some 2,000 miles, more or less, up 
the river, that when he saw his freight bill of $125 per ton for transportation 
from St. Michael to his station, he added a petition in his prayer that freight 
might be reduced. During the stay at, St. Michael two interesting boys, Wil- 
liam and George Frederickson, from Anvik, on the Yukon River, were received 
on board to accompany me East. Their father, a trader, is sending them to New 
York for an education. After a pleasant visit of two days, the Bear took her 
departure for Nunivak island. On the following Sabbath night, and through all 
Monday, we were steaming around the island, that the captain might secure the 
‘census. Finding that the people were scattered, hunting and fishing, and be- 
ing warned by the few natives he met of dangerous rocks and reefs, and the 
waters being uncharted, on Monday evening the captain turned around and 
steamed for St. George Island, which we reached on the morning of August 
27. Nearing the island, a schooner was seen crowding on all sail to get out of 
ourway. As the captain had not yet received his instructions, which were await- | 
ing his arrival at Unalaska, and had no authority to make any seizures, the 
schooner was allowed to proceed unmolested. She was one of the many pirati- 
eal vessels that are fitted out at Victoria, British Columbia, and San Francisco, _ 
to hunt seals in Bering Sea contrary to law. In 1886 there were 21 such ves- 
sels from Victoria alone, and the catch was 35,556 skins. In 1887 there were    
-P-A-G-E-693
     EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1285 
20 vessels from Victoria, 8 of which were seized; the catch was 27,624 skins. 
In 1888 there were 19 British vessels, with a total catch of nearly 30,000 skins. 
In 1889, 23 British vessels, and this year 22 British and 12 American vessels en- 
gaged in seal piracy. Their methods of operation are so wasteful that the num- 
ber of skins taken does not begin to represent the number of sealskilled. They 
necessarily hunt out to sea, where they largely kill the females heavy with their 
young. A large percentage of the seals shot sink before they can be secured, so 
that many authorities state that the 20,000 to 30,000 secured represent from 150,- 
000, to 200,000 seals destroyed. This wasteful method israpidly annihilating the 
fur seal, so that if our granddaughters are to have seal-skin sacques the Govern- 
ment will need to take more stringent measures for the protection of the seal. 
The indiscriminate slaughter of the seal while passing to their breeding grounds 
has caused such a scarcity on the seal islands, that while the Government allows 
100,000 males to be taken annually, this year the vessels have been able to se- 
cure but 21,000 skins. 
The piratical vessels fitted out at Victoria, British Columbia, to hunt seal 
have caused the international complications known as the ‘“‘ Bering Sea diffi- 
culty,” which are now the subject of negotiations between the State Depart- 
ment and Great Britain. 
WHALING INDUSTRY. 
As early as the year 1841 fifty whaling vessels had found their way from New 
Bedford and Boston to Bering Sea. From 1842 and onward for a number of 
years annual complaints were made to the Russian Government by the Russian- 
American Fur Company of the encroachments of the Yankee whalers. In 1852 
the whaling fleet had increased to 278 vessels, and the value of the catch to 
$14,000,000. This was probably the most profitable year of the whaling industry 
in lacie Since then it has, in the main, decreased, until in 1862 the value 
of the catch was less than $800,000. This increased again in 1867 to $3,200,000. In 
1880 the first steamer was added to the whaling fleet, being sent out from San 
\Francisco. Last year there were 26 vessels from San Francisco and 23 from New 
New Bedford engaged in the trade. They captured 151 whales, which yielded 
213,070 pounds of whale bone and 12,243 barrels of oil. This season there are 10 
steamers and 38 sailing vessels employed in these northern waters with a very 
light catch up to midsummer. The whaling vessels are manned upon the co- 
operative plan; the men instead of being paid regular wages réceive a percent- 
age of the profits. The captain on the sailing vessels receives a twelfth, the 
first mate a nineteenth, the second mate and boat headers each a twenty-fifth, 
the third mate a thirtieth, the fourth mate, carpenter, cooper, and steward each 
a fiftieth, and the sailors each a one hundred and seventy-fifth. On steamers 
the rates are alittle lower. A captain’s wages range from nothing to $7,000 or 
$8,000, according to the number of whales taken. If the ship gets six whales 
during a cruise the captain will have about $1,400 and a sailor $100. The'sailors 
usually receive an advance of $60, and during the cruise are allowed to draw cloth- 
ing, tobacco, etc., from the ship’s supplies (called the ‘‘slop chest’’) to the amount 
of $60 to $80. Consequently if there are no profits to divide the sailor is sure of - 
about $140. The captains and higher officers are usually men of more than ordi- 
nary character and intelligence—typical American seamen of the best kind. 
The common sailors oh a whaler are made up largely of Portuguese, Italians, 
South Sea Islanders, and others of an inferior grade, some of them being, em- 
phatically, hard cases. ¥ 
A few years ago whales were plentiful in the North Pacific, Bering, and Ok- 
hotsk Seas. Then they were followed through Bering Straits a little way into 
the Arctic. Then farther and farther the whales have been driven into the 
inaccessible regions of the North, until now the whaling fleet annually rounds 
the most northern extremity of the American continent, and this year, for the 
first time, afew of them will winter in the Arctic, at the mouthof the Makenzie 
River. To escape this deadly pursuit the whales try to hide in theice, and after 
them the whalers boldly force their way. The business isso dangerous thatdur- 
ing the last 20 years more than 100 vessels have been lost. The value of the 
whale fisheries consists not so much inthe oil taken, as inthe whale-bone, which 
is taken from his mouth; this is worth between $4.50 and $5 per pound. The 
product of a fair sized, bowhead whale, at present prices, is worth about $8,000. 
A good sized whale weighs about 150 tons, and contains about 2,000 pounds of 
whalebone after it is cleaned. His tonguc is 15 feet long, from 6 to 8 feet in thick- 
ness, and contains 12 barrels of cil.- His open mouth is from 15 to 20 feet across;

While lying at anchor at St. George, the United States Revenue Marine 
steamer Rush, Capt. Coulson commanding, dropped anchor near us, and we re- 
_ceived two and one-half months later news from the outside world. With visit- 
ing on shipboard and on land, the day slipped by very rapidly and pleasantly, 
and the following morning we were under way for Unalaska, reaching there on 
the 29th of August. At Unlaska I received letters from Eastern friends, the 
latest being dated June 3. 
THE ESKIMOS OF ALASKA. 
During June, July, and August, I cruised 5,000 miles along the coasts of Asia 
and America, from the Aleutian Islands to Point Barrow, the northern limit of 
the continent, and back to Unalaska. I visited all the principal settlements of 
the coast, and saw much of the native people. These people all Velong to the 
_ Innuit or Eskimo family. They occupy not only the Arctic and Bermg.Sea 
coasts, but also that of the mainland coast of the North Pacific, as far east a3 
mount St. Elias, and number in all about17,000to 20,000. In the extreme north, 
at Point Barrow, and along the coast of Bering Sea, they are of medium size. 
-At Point Barrow the average height of the males ‘is 5 feet 3 inches, and average 
weight 153 pounds; of the women, 4 feet 11 inches, and weight 135. On the 
Nushagak River the average weight of the men is from 150 to 167 pounds. 
From Cape Prince of Wales to Icey Cape, and on the great inland rivers emptying 
into the Arctic Ocean, they arealarge race, many of them being 6 feet and over in 
height. They are lighter in color and fairer than the North American Indian, 
have black and brown eyes, black hair (some with a tinge of brown), high cheek 
bones, fleshy faces, small hands and feet, and good teeth. The men have thin 
beards. Along the Arctic coast the men cut their hair closely oa the crown of 
the head, giving them the appearance of monks; this isdoneso that when crawl- 
ing up to the deer, the latter will not be frightened away by the flutter of the 
hair in the wind. Some of the young are fairly good looking, but, through ex- 
posure and hardship, become old at 380 years of age. They are naturally intelli- 
gent, ingenious in extricating themselves from difficulties, fertile in resources, 
and quick to adopt American ways and methods when they are an improvement 
on their own. Physically they are very strong, with great powers of endurance. 
When on a journey, if food is scarce, they will travel 30 to 40 miles without 
breaking their fast. Lieut. Cantwell, in his explorations of the Kowah River, 
  ~ makes record that upon one occasion when he wanted a heavy stone for an an- 
chor, a woman went out, and, alone, loaded into her birch bark canoe, and 
brought him a stone that would weigh 800 pounds. It took two strong men to 
lift it out of the canoe. 
Another explorer speaks of a woman carrying off on her shoulder a box of 
lead weighing 280 pounds. This summer, inerecting the school buildings in the 
Arctic, there being no drays or horses in that country, all the timber, lumber, 
hardware, etc., had to be carried from the beach to the site of the house on the 
shoulders of the people. The women carried the same loads as the men. They. 
are, as a rule, industrious; men, women, and children doing their individual 
part toward the family support. The hard struggle for.a bare existence in the 
sterile region where they live compels it. Ina general way they are honest. 
Property intrusted to them by the whitesiskeptsecure. Property stowed away 
in acache or tent needs no lock or watchman—it is safe. Small articles left ly- 
ing around uncared for are soon picked up and carried off. Perhaps they look 
upon them asif they had been thrown away. A white man can leave with one of 
them who is an entire stranger to him $100 or $200 worth of goods, saying, ‘‘ Buy 
me some furs and I will be back here next year.” The following season the na- 
tive, with thefurs, isin waiting for the expectedarrival. This isdone every sea- 
son. Ihave the account-book of one of these native traders in which he has re- 
corded every skin purchased, and how much of each article paid for it. As the 
native can neither read, write, nor speak English, and his own language is an 
unwritten one, of course the accounts are kept by symbols and signs. They are 
shrewd traders. Nomatter how much is offered for an article, they ask for more. 
If they set the price themselves, and the purchaser accedes toit, they frequently 
attempt to raise it. They are exceedingly dirty and filthy in their persons and 
clothing. But perhaps this is somewhat excusable in a country where, in win- 
ter, water is scarce and soapscarcer. I remember once hearing a very successful 
missionary, who had spent many years north of the Arctic Circle, say that he

tried to make it a rule, when traveling with a dog sled, to wash his face at least — 
once a week, but that he hdd not always been able to doit. The Alaska Eskimo 
is a good-natured, docile, and accommodating race. Wherever I met them, and _ 
under whatever circumstances, they had a smile of welcome, and in many ways 
showed a friendly spirit. They have also manifested an unexpected interest in 
the establishment of schools among them, which promises well for the future. 
ORNAMENTATION. 
Among the Thlinket people of southeastern Alaska the labret is worn by the ~ 
women only. Among the Eskimo of northwestern Alaska, on the contrary, it 
is worn by the men alone. The use of it is almost univer: sal. 
During boyhood a hole is cut through the lower lip below each corner of the 
mouth and an ivory plug inserted until the wound heals. After healing, the ~ 
hole is stretched from time to time until it reaches about half an inch in diam- 
eter. Into this they insert the labret. 
These labrets are made of stone, jade, coal, ivory, bone, and glass. They are 
shaped like a silk hat in miniature. The labret is three-fourths of an inch in- 
diameter, 1 inch in diameter at the rim, and 1inch long. The rim is kept in- 
side of the mouth and holds the labret in place. 
Many wear this form of labret on the one side of the mouth, and on the othera 
much larger one, resembling a large sleeve-button, 1% inches in diameter on the 
outside, 1¢ inches on the inside rim, and one-half inch neck. 
Formerly they wore a large labret in the center of the lower lip. I secured a 
beautiful one of polished jade that has an outside surface 24 inches by 1 inch. 
The girls have their ears and sometimes their noses pierced, wearing pendant 
from them copper, ivory, and bone ornaments, also strings of beads. Sometimes 
these beads extend from one ear to the other, either under the chin or back of © 
the head. 
Both sexes tatoo, more or less elaborately, their faces, hands, and arms, Both 
sexes wear bracelets, amulets, and sometimes fancy belts. 
DRESS. 
They make waterproof boots of seal skin, with walrus or sea-lion hide soles. 
For cold weather the boots are made of seal or reindeer skin, tanned with the hair 
on, and walrus-hide soles. 
The foot portion is made many times larger than the foot, in order to give 
room for a padding ofgrass. These bootsare so much warmer and more comfort- 
able than the ordinary leather ones that they are almost universally used by 
whalers and others who have occasion to visit Arctic regions. A fur shirt and 
a pair of fur pants complete the toilet. The shirt is called a parka, and fre- 
quently has a hood attached, which can be pulled over the head in a storm. 
Others have a fur hood which, when not on the head, hangs around the neck. 
Ordinarily in summer the head is uncovered. 5 
-In winter two suits are worn, the inner one with the fur next to the body, and 
the outer one with the fur to the weather. 
The difference between male and female attire is in the shape and ornamenta- 
tion of the parka. Among some of the tribes the pants and boots of the women 
are in one garment. There is also a fullness in the back of the woman’s parka 
to make room for the carrying of the baby inside between the shoulders of the 
mother. These clothes are made largely of theskins of the reindeer, squirrels, 
and birds. From the intestines of the seal and walrus and also from salmon 
skins are made the famous kamleika, a waterproof garment, which is worn over 
the others in wet weather. The kamleika is lighter in weight and a better 
waterproof garment than the rubber garments of commerce. 
The native dress, when well made, new and clean, is both becoming and ar- 
tistic. 
  FOOD. 
They live principally upon the fish, seal, walrus, whale, reindeer, and wild — 
birds of their country. Latterly they are learning the use of flour, which they 
procure from the Government revenue vessels or barter from the whalers. 
They have but few household utensels. A few have secured iron kettles. 
Many still use grass-woven baskets and bowls of wood and stone. Occasionally 
is found a jar of burntclay. In these native dishes water was boiled by drop- 
ping in hot stones. 
   
-P-A-G-E-696
    Z i : “ <p 
1288 = ——_. EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. i. 
Among the more northern tribes much of the food is eaten raw, and nothing 
is thrown away, no matter how rotten or offensive it has become. t 
Some of their choicest delicacies would be particularly disgusting tous. . Hav- 
ing, at one of the bird rookeries in the Arctic, gathered a number of eggs, it 
was found that many of them contained chickens. When about to throw them 
_ overboard, the native interpreter remonstrated, saying: ‘‘No! me eat them. 
Good!” 
_ All classes have a great craving for tobacco and liguor. Even nursing babes 
are seen with a quid of tobacco in their mouths. 
During the summer large quantities of fish are dried, and the oil of the seal, 
walrus, and whale put up for winter use. The oil is kept in bags made of 
the skin of the seal, similar to the water-skins of Oriental lands. The oil is 
kept sweet by the bags being buried in the frozen earth until wanted for use. 
  DWELLINGS. 
_ The coast Eskimo have underground permanent houses in villages for winter, 
and tents that are frequently shifted for summer. 
The Eskimo of the interior, being largely nomads, live in tents much of the 
time. The tents are covered with reindeer skins, walrus hides, or cotton can- 
vas. In making a winter house, a cellar from 20 to 25 feet square is dug, from 3 
to 5 feet deep. At the corners and along the sides of the excavation are set 
_ posts of driftword or whalebone. On the outside of these, poles of driftwood are 
laid up one upon another to the top. Other timbers are placed across the top, 
forming the roof or ceiling. Against the outside and upon the roof, dirt and 
sod are piled until the whole has the appearance of a large mound. In the cen- 
ter of the dome is an opening about 18 inches across. Across this is stretched 
the transparent bladder of the seal or walrus. This opening furnishes light to 
the room below. A narrow platform extends along one, or more sides of the 
room, upon which are stowed the belongings of the family and the reindeer-skin 
bedding. The platform is also the sleeping-place of the family. 
Large, shallow dishes of earthenware, bone, or stone, filled with seal oil, are 
the combined stove and lamp of the family. Some lighted moss makes a dull 
line of flame along the edge of the dish. Irequently a piece of blubber is sus- 
pended over the fiame, the dripping of which keeps the lamp replenished. 
Many of the houses were so warm that we found our usual outdoor clothing 
burdensome. : 
At one side of some rooms, and in the fioor near the center of the room in 
others, is a small opexing about 20 inches square. This is the doorway, and 
leads to a hall or outside room. If the opening is in the side of the room, a rein- 
deer skin curtain hangs over it. This outer place is sometimes a hall 12 to 15 
feet long and 2 feet wide and high, leading to a well or shaft. This shaft is 6 or 
7 feet deep, and leads up a rude ladder into the open air. In other cases it is a 
large room 12 or 15 feet square, containing, on either side of the passageway 
through the center, a place to store the winter supplies of oil, fish, and flour. 
The exit from the storeroom is similar to that from the hall, up a ladder and 
through a small hole. Whena storm is raging outside this hole is covered with 
a board or flat stone or large, flat whalebone. 
All villages of importance contain a public room or town hall. This is built 
in the same manner as the private dwellings, only much larger. ~Some of these 
are 60 feet square, 20 feet high, and contain three tiersor platforms. This build- 
ing is called the kashima or kashga. In them are held the public festivals and 
dances. They are also the common workshop in which the men make ‘their 
snowshoes, dog sleds, spears and other implements. 
The villages, from the deck of a coasting vessel, have the appearance of so 
many hillocks or dunes along the beach. 
IMPLEMENTS. 
The Eskimo of Arctic Alaska are still in the stone age. The manufacture of 
arrows and spear heads from flint is a living industry. Stone lamps, stone ham- 
mersand chisels, and to some extent stone knives, are still in ordinary use among 
them. Fish lines and nets and bird snares are still made of whalebone, sinew, 
or rawhide. Arrows, spears, nets, and traps are used in hunting, although im- 
proved breach-loading arms are being introduced among them, and will soon 
supersede, for the larger game, their own more primitive weapons. 
For transportation on land they have the <nowshoe, dog team, and sled ;-and 
on the water the kiak and umiak. 
 
-P-A-G-E-697
      
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. Soe 1289 
The kiak is a long, narrow, light, graceful, skin-covered canoe, with one, two, 
or three holes, according to the number of people to be carried. It is the uni- 
versal boat of the Eskimo, and is found from Greenland around the whole north- 
ern coast of America, wherever that people are found. 
The umiak isa long, skin-covered boat. This is the family boat or carryall. 
Those in uso around Bering Straits are about 24 feet long and 5 feet wide. They 
will safely carry 15 persons and 500 pounds of freight, coasting in the sea, Those 
on Kotzebue Sound, in the Arctic Ocean, are 35 feet long, 6 feet wide, with a 
capacity of 3,000 pounds of freight, and a crew of 6. There are exceptionally 
large ones that will carry from 50 to 80 people. Both the kiaks and umiaks are 
made of walrus, sea lion, or white whale hides stretched over light frames of 
spruce wood. 
MARRIAGE. 
There seems to be no special ceremony among them connected with marriage. 
If the parties are young people, it is largely arranged by the parents. 
Among some of the tribes the husband joins his wife’s family and is expected 
to hunt and fish for them. If he refuses to give his father-in-law the furs he 
takes he is driven out of the house and some one else more active or obedient 
isinstalled as husband of the girl. Sometimes a young woman has tenor twelve 
husbands before she fairly settles down. Under this condition of things itis not 
strange that the women become indifferent and often untrue to their husbands. 
Love and mutual affection has so little to do with the relation that upon occa- 
sion husbands and wives are interchanged. 
For instance, in one of the northern villages dwelt a family of expert fishers 
and another that was successful at hunting the reindeer. One year the fisher- 
man thought he would like to hunt reindeer. Finding that his neighbor would ~ 
like to try fishing, they exchanged wives for the summer. The woman who was 
a good hunter went off with the fisherman and vice versa. Upon reaching home 
in the fall, they returned to their respective husbands. * 
Again a certain man wished to make a long journey into the interior. His ~ 
wife being sick and unable to endure the hardships of the trip, he arranged with 
a friend, who had a strong, healthy wife, for an exchange until he should re- 
turn. This was done with the consent of all parties. Wives are frequensly 
beaten by their husbands, and sometimes, to escape abuse, commit suicide. In 
the winter of 1889 a woman at Point Hope who had been beaten and stabbed by 
her jealous husband one night during a raging blizzard harnessed the dogs to the 
sled, then fastening one end of a rope to the sled and the other as a noose around 
her neck, she started up the team and was choked and dragged to death. Oc- 
casionally a wife resists, a1.d, if physically the stronger, thrashes the husband. 
Polygamy prevails to a limited extent. Frequently the second wife is looked on 
and treated as a servant in the family: Among some of the tribes the custom 
prevails of the sons.having the same number of wives as the father, without 
reference to their ability to maintain them. No more, no less, than a species of 
hereditary polygamy. : 
Among the Eskimo, the same as among all uncivilized people, woman’s is a 
hard lot. One of the missionary ladies writes: ‘‘ My heart aches for the girls 
of our part of Alaska. They aremade perfect prostitutes by their parents from 
the time they are 9 or 10 years old until that parent dies. And yet, notwith- 
standing all their disadvantages, they have a voice in both family and village 
affairs. The husband makes no important bargain, or plans a trip, without con- 
sulting and deferring to his wife.” 3 
The customs pertaining to childbirth are barbarous, and it would not be strange 
if both mother and child should perish. Large families of children are the ex- 
ception; few haveabove four. The drudgery of women is such that they often, 
destroy their unborn and sometimes born offspring, particularly if the child is 
agirl. <A missionary gives the following incident: ‘‘Some one tied a helpless 
little child of about two years down to the water’s edge at low tide. Its cries ~ 
attracted the attention of a passer-by, who found the water already nearly up to 
his back. The man took it to his home and cared for it. It was recognized as 
a child that had been left in the care of an old woman; the child was sickly, and 
doubtless was too much of a care for her. The only surprise expressed by the 
people was that any one should want to drown or kill a boy.” 
Ifa family is very poor they sometimes give away to childless neighbors all 
their children but one. Thus, during childhood, a boy may pass from one to 
another to be adopted by several families in turn. Children are also sold by 
their parents, the usual market price of a child being a sealskin bag of oil or an

old suit‘of clothes. During infancy children are carriedunder the parka, astride 
of the mother’s back, being held in position by a strap under the child’s thighs” 
and around the mother’s body across the chest. Whenout from under the parka, 
they are carried seated on the back of the mother’s neck and shoulders, with 
the child’s legs hanging down in front on both sides of the neck. The children 
are given the names of various animals, birds, fish, sections of country, winds, 
tides, heavenly bodies, etc. Sometimes-they have as many as six names. Chil- 
dren are rarely punished—generally have their own way, and are usually treated 
with great kindness by their own or foster parents. Prominent events in the 
life of a boy, such as having his hair cut for the first time, like a hunter—his 
first trip to sea in a kiak—his first use of snowshoes, etc.—are celebrated by a 
feast if the family are not too poor. 
FESTIVALS. 
   __ Different tribes have different festivals. Among others there is usually one 
_ for every animal hunted by the people. A whale dance, seal, walrus and-rein- 
deer dances, etc. There are festivities for the spirits of wives, land and sea, 
_ dead friends, sleds, boats, etc. Some of these are held during the long winter 
darkness, and others, with dancing, wrestling, and foot-racing, at the great an- 
nual gathering in summer. 
SUPERSTITIONS. 
‘Like all other ignorant people, they are firm believers in witchcraft and spirits 
- generally. They also believe in the transmigration of souls. That spiritsenter 
into animals and inanimate nature, into rocks, winds, and tides. That they are 
good pr bad according as the business, the community, or the individual is suc- 
cessful or unsuccessful, and that these conditions can be changed by sorcery. 
By suitable incantations they firmly believe that they can control the wind and 
‘the elements, that they can reward friends and punish enemies. 
The foundation of their whole religious system is this belief in spirits and the 
appeasing of evil spirits. This demonor evil spirit worship colors their whole 
life and all its pursuits. Every particular animal hunted, every phenomenon of 
nature, every eventof life, requires a religious observance of its own. It is a 
heavy and burdensome work that darkens their life—it leads to many deeds of 
‘unnatural cruelty. At the mouth of the Kuskokwine River an old woman was 
accused of having caused the death of several children—of being a witch. This 
was so firmly believed that her own husband pounded her to death, cut up her 
poey inio small pieces, severing joint from joint, and then consuming it with oil 
in a tre. 
SHAMANS. 
4 
The head and front of this great evil is tho Shaman, or sorcerer. He is be- 
lieved to be the only one that can control the evil spirits and protect the people 
from them. Mr. John W. Kelly, who has written recently an interesting mono- 
gram on the Eskimo, represents the Shamans as divided into seven degrees, 
being graded according to their knowledge of spiritualism, ventriloquism, feats 
.of legerdemain and general cunning. It is claimed that those of the seventh 
degree are immortal, and can neither be killed nor wounded; that those of the 
sixth degree can be wounded, but not killed. The ordinary Shaman belongs to 
_ the lower degrees and only claims to go into trances, in which state his spirit 
ees the body and roams abroad procuring the information his patrons are in 
search of. 
As a rule the Shamans are unscrupulous frauds, thieves, and murderers, and 
should be put down by the strong hand of the General Government. 
SICKNESS. ' 
The prevailing diseases among the Eskimo are scrofula, diphtheria, pneu- 
_ monia, and consumption, and the death rate is large. They have a superstitious 
fear with reference to a death in the house, so that when the sick are thought 
to be nearing death they are carried out of the home and placed in an outhouse. 
If they do not die as soon as they expect, they ask to be killed, which is usually 
done by the Shaman stabbing them in the temple or breast. The aged and help-
-P-A-G-E-699

less are also sometimes killed at their own request. A prominent man in a tribe 
not long since tried to hire men to kill his aunt, who was insane and dependent 
onhim. Failing to have her-killed, he deliberately froze her to death. The 
cruelty of heathenism is almost beyond belief. The dead are wrapped. up in 
reindeer or seal skins and drawn on a sled back of the village, where they are 
placed upon elevated scaffolds, out of the reach of animals, or upon the ground 
and covered over with driftwood, or, as among some of the tribes, left upon the 
ground, to be soon torn in pieces and devoured by the dogs of the village, EDUCATION IN ALASKA. , f 
GOVERNMENT. 
The Eskimos have no tribal organization and-are without chiefs. The most 
successful trader among them becomes the wealthiest man and is called Umailik. 
By virtue of the influence that riches exert he is considered the leader in busi- 
ness transactions. In special exigencies, affecting a whole village, the old men 
assemble and determine upon a plan of action. The Shamans also have great 
influence among the people. It often happens that the Umailik and Shaman 
are the same person. 
FOOD SUPPLY. 
From time immemorial they have lived upon the whale, the walrus, and the 
seal of their coasts, the fish and aquatic birds of their rivers, and the caribou or 
wild reindeer of their vast inland plains. 
The supply of these in years past was abundant and furnished ample food for 
all the people. But fifty years ago American whalers, having largely exhausted 
the whale in other waters, found their way into the North Pacific Ocean. 
‘Then commenced for that section the slaughtar and destruction of whales that 
‘went steadily forward at the rate of hundreds and thousands annually, until. 
» they were destroyed and driven out of the Pacific Ocean. They were then fol- . 
lowed into Bering Sea, and the slaughter went on. The whales took refuge 
among the ice fields of the Arctic Ocean, and thither the whalers followed. In 
this relentless hunt the remnant have been driven still farther into the inacces- 
sible regions around the north pole, and are no longer within reach of the 
natives. 
As the great herds of buffalo that once roamed the western prairies have 
been exterminated for théir pelts, so the whales have been sacrificed for the fat 
that encased their bodies and the bone that hung in their mouths. With the — 
destruction of the whale one large source of food supply for the natives has 
~ been cut off. 
Another large supply was derived from the walrus, which, once swarmed in 
great numbers in those northern seas. But commerce wanted more ivory, and 
the whalers turned their attention to the walrus, destroying thousands an- 
nually for the sake of their tusks. Where a few years ago they were so numer- 
ous that their bellowings were heard above the roar of the waves and grinding 
and crashing of the ice fields, this year [ cruised for weeks without seeing or 
hearing one. The walrus as a source of food supply is already practically ex- 
tinct. 
The seal and sea lion, once so common in Bering Sea, are now becoming so. 
scarce that it is with difficulty that the natives procure a sufficient number of 
skins to cover their boats, and their flesh, on account of its rarity, has become a 
luxury. 
In the past the natives, with tireless industry, caught and cured for uSe in 
their long winters great quantities of fish, but American canneries have already 
come to one of their streams (Nushagak) and will soon be found on all of them, 
both carrying the food outof the country and by their wasteful methods destroy- 
ing the future supply. Five million cans of salmon annually shipped away from 
Alaska—and the business still in its infancy—means starvation to the native 
races in the near future. 
With the advent of improved breech-loading firearms the wild reindeer are 
both being killed off and frightened away to the remote and more inaccessible 
regions of the interior and another source of food supply is diminishing. 
‘Thus the support of the people is largely gone and the process of slow starva- 
tion and extermination has commenced along the whole Arctic coast of Alaska. 
Villages that once numbered thousands have been reduced to hundreds; of 
some tribes but two or three families remain. At Point Barrow, in 1828, Capt. 
Beechey’s expedition found Nuwuk a village of 1,000 people ; in 1863 there were 
, 
  
-P-A-G-E-700
   1292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. * 
  309; now there are not over 100. In 1826 Capt. Beechey speaks of finding a 
large population at Cape Franklin; to-day it is without an inhabitant. He also 
mentions a large village of 1,000 to 2,000 people on Schismareff Inlet ; it has now 
but three houses. 
According to Mr. John W. Kelly, who has written a monograph upon the 
Arctic Eskimo of Alaska, Point Hope, at the commencement of the century, had 
a population of .2,000; now it has about 350. Mr. Kelly further says: ‘The 
_Kayea county is almost depopulated owing to the scarcity of game, which has 
been killed or drivenaway. * * * The coast tribes between Point Hope and 
Point Barrow have been cut down in population so as to be almost obliterated. 
The Kookpovoros of Point Lay have only three huts left; the Ootookas of Icy 
Cape one hut; the Koogmute has three settlements of from one to four families; 
Sezaro has about 80 people.” 
_ Mr. Henry D. Woolfe, who has spent many years in the Arctic region, writes: 
“Along the seacoast from Wainright Inlet to Point Lay numerous remains of 
houses testify to the former number of the people. * * * From Cape Seppings 
to Cape Krusenstern and inland to Nounatok River there still remain about 40 
people, the remnant of atribe called Key-wah-ling-nach-ah-mutzs. They willina 
few years entirely disappear as a distinctive tribe.” i 
I myself saw a number of abandoned villages and crumbling houses during the 
summer, and wherever I visited the people I heard the same tale of destitution. 
On the island of Attou, once famous for the number of its sea-otter skins, the 
catch for the past nine years has averaged but 3 sea-otter and 25 fox skins, an 
annual income of about $2 for each person. The Alaska Commercial Company 
this past summer sent $1,300 worth of provisions to keep them from starving. 
At Akutan the whole catch for the past summer was19seaotters. This repre- 
sents the entire support of 100 people for twelve months. At Unalaska both the 
agent of the Alaska Commercial Company and the teacher of the Government 
school testified that there would be great destitution among the people this 
winter because of the disappearance of the sea otter. At St. George Island the 
United States Treasury agent testified that there was not sufficientsprovisions’ 
on the island to last through the season, and asked thata Government vessel might 
be sent with a full supply. At Cape Prince of Wales, Point Hope, and Point 
Barrow was the same account of short supply of food. At the latter place inti- 
mations were given that the natives in their distress would break into the Goy- 
ernment warehouse and help themselves to the supply that is in store for ship- 
wrecked whalers. At Point Barrow, largely owing to the insufficient food 
supply, the death rate is reported to the birth rate as 15 to 1. It does not take 
long to figure out theend. ‘They will die off more and more rapidly as the already 
insufficient food supply becomes less and less. 
INTRODUCTION OF REINDEER. 
In this crisis it is important that steps should be taken at once to afford relief. 
Relief can, of course, be afforded by Congress voting an appropriation to feed 
them, as it has done for somany of the North American Indians. ButI think that 
every one familiar with the feeding process among the Indians will devoutly wish 
that it may not be necessary to extend that system to the Eskimo of Alaska. It 
would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, and, worse than that, de- 
grade, pauperize, and finally exterminate the people. There isabetter, cheaper, 
more practical, and more humane way, and that is to introduce into northern 
_ Alaska the domesticated reindeer of Siberia, and train the Eskimo young men 
in their management, care, and propagation. 
This would in afew years create as permanent and secure a food supply for 
the Eskimo as cattle or sheep raising in Texas or New Mexico does for the peo- 
ple of those sections. 
It may be necessary to afford temporary relief for two or three years to the 
Eskimo, until the herds of domestic reindeer can be started, but after that the 
people will be self-supporting. 
. As you well know, in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Lapland and Siberia 
‘the domesticated reindeer isfood,clothing,house,furniture ,implements,andtrans- 
portation to the people. Its milk and flesh furnish food; its marrow and tongue 
are considered choice delicacies; its blood, mixed with the contents of its stom- 
ach, is made into a favorite dish calledin Siberia ‘“‘manyalla;” its intestines are 
cleaned, filled-with tallow, and eaten as a sausage; its skin is made into clothes, 
bedding, tent covers, reindeer harness, ropes, cords, and fish lines; the hard skin 
of the forelegs makes an excellent covering for snowshoes.
-P-A-G-E-701
  . EDUCATION IN ALASKA. : 1293 
Its sinews are dried and pounded into a strong and lasting thread; its bones 
are soaked in seal oil and burned for fuel; its horns are made into various kinds 
of household implements, into weapons for hunting and war, and in the manu- 
facture of sleds. 
Indeed, I know of no other animal that inso many different ways can minister _ 
to the comfort and well- ‘being of man in the far northern regions of the earth as 
the reindeer, 
The reindeer form their riches; these their tents, 
Their robes, their beds, and all their homely wealth supply; 
Their wholesome fare and cheerful cups. 
Under favorable circumstances a swift reindeer can traverse 150 miles in a day. 
A speed of 100 miles per day is easily made. As a beast of burden they can 
. draw a load of 300 pounds. They yield a cupful of milkata milking; ee 
quantity, however, is so thick and rich that it needs to be diluted with nearl, 
quart of water to ‘make it drinkable. It hasa strong flavor like goat’s mi i 
and is more nutritious and nourishing than cow’s milk. The Laps manufacture 
from it butter and cheese. A dressed reindeer in Siberia weighs from 80 to 100 
pounds. The reindeer feed upon the moss and other lichens that abound in the 
Arctic regions, and the farther north the larger and stronger the reindeer. 
Now, in Central and Arctic Alaska are between 300,000and 400,000 square miles 
(an area equal to the New England and Middle States combined, together with 
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois) of moss-covered tundra and rolling ‘plains of grass 
that are specially adapted by nature for the grazing of the reindeer and is prac- 
tically useless for any other purpose. 
If it isa sound public policy to bore artesian wells and build water- -storage 
reservoirs, by which thousands of arid acres can be reclaimed from barrenness 
and made fruitful, it is equally a sound public policy to stock the plains of Alaska 
with herds of domesticated reindeer, and cause those vast, dreary, desolate, 
frozen, and storm-swept regions to minister to the wealth, happiness, comfort, 
_ and well-being of man. What stock-raising has been and is on the vast plains 
of Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana, reindeer-: raising can be in north- 
ern Alaska. In the corresponding regions of Lapland, in Arctic Norway, and _ 3 
in Sweden and Russia are 27,000 people supporting themselves (besides paying 
a tax to the Government of $400,000, or $1 per head for their reindeer) and pro- 
curing their food and clothing largely from their 400,000 domesticated reindeer. 
Also in the corresponding regions of Siberia, with similar climate, soil, and en- 
vironment (and only 40 miles distant at the straits), are thousands of Chukchees, 
Koraks, and other tribes fed and clothed by their tens of thousands of domesti- 
cated reindeer. 
During the summer I visited four settlements of natives on the Siberian coast, 
the two extremes being 700 miles apart, and saw much of the people, both of the — 
Koraks and Chukchees. I found them a good-sized, robust, fleshy, well-fed, 
pagan, half-civilized, nomad people, living largely on their herds Of reindeer. 
Families own from i 009 to 10, 000 deer. ‘These are divided into herds of from 
1,000 to 1,500. One of these latter I visited on the beach near Cape Navarin. In 
Aretic Siberia the natives with their reindeer have plenty; in Arctic Alaska 
without the reindeer they are starving. 
Then instead of feeding and pauperizing them let us civilize, build up their 
manhood, and lift them into self-su port by helping them to the reindeer. To 
stock ‘Alaska with reindeer and Siake millionsof acres of moss-covered tundra 
conducive to the wealth of the country, would be a great and worthy event 
under any circumstances. 
But just now it is specially important and urgent from the fact that the destruc> 
tion of the whale and walrus has brought large numbers of Eskimo face to face 
with starvation, and that something must be done promptly to save them. 
The introduction of the reindeer would ultimately afford them a steady and 
permanent food supply. 
INTRODUCTION OF CHRISTIANITY. 
In the Tenth United States Census Report, on page 2, it is recorded: ‘* That 
no trace or shadow of Christianity and its teachings has found its way to these 
desolate regions: the dark night of Shamanism or Sorcery still hangs over the 
fnuman mind. These people share with their Eastern kin a general belief in evil
-P-A-G-E-702
    1294 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
_spirits and powers, against whom the Shaman alone can afford protection by sac- _ 
rifices and incantations. No philanthropic missionary has ever found his way 
to this Arctic coast, and unless some modern Hans Egede makes his appearance 
among them in the near future there will be no soil left in which to plant the 
Christian seed.” : 
~ Such was the dark but true picture in 1880, but the dawn was near at hand. 
_ The needs of the Eskimos had long been upon my mind, and various plans for 
reaching them had been considered. In the spring of 1888, having an opportunity 
of visiting Bethlehem, Pa.,I secured a conference with the late Edmund de 
Schweinitz, D. D., a bishop of the Moravian Church, and urged upon him the es- 
tablishment of a mission to the Eskimo of Alaska. A few days later the request 
was repeated in writing, which letter, on the 23d of August, 1883, was laid before 
the Moravian Society for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen. The 
request was favorably considered, and Rev. A. Hartman and Mr. Wm. H. Wein- 
land were appointed a committee to visit Alaska and report on the advisability” 
of commencing a mission. This tour of exploration was made in the summer of 
1884, and is given in my annual report for 1885-86. Upon their return they rec- 
ommended the establishment of a mission on the Kuskokwim River, near the 
native village of Mumtreklagamute, 75 miles above the mouth of the stream. In 
the spring of 1885 Rev. and Mrs. Wm. H. Weinland, Rev. and Mrs. John H. Kil- 
buck, and Mr. Hans Torgersen were sent to the Kuskokwim River as the first» 
missionaries to the Eskimo of Alaska. The present mission force consists of 
- Rev. and Mrs. John H. Kilbuck, Rev. and Mrs. Ernst L. Webber, and Miss Lydia 
’ Lebus. In the summer of 1886 the Moravians sent out the Rey. Frank E. Wolff, 
who located a station and erected a mission station at the mouth of the Nushagak 
River. He then returned to the States for the winter. The mission was for- 
mally opened in the summer of 1887 with the arrival of Rey. and Mrs. F, E. Wolff 
and Miss Mary Huber. To the original number have since been added Rev. J. 
H. Schoechert and Miss Emma Huber. Both of these schools have been assisted 
by the United States Bureau of Education. S 
On the Ist of July, 1886, an agreement was entered into between the Commis- 
- sioner of Education and the Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church 
for the establishment of a school in the great Yukon Valley. Owing to the im- 
possibility of getting the supplies into that inaccessible region the school was 
® Be ielned for 1886-87 at St. Michael, on the coast, by Rev. and Mrs. Octavius 
arker, 
In the summer of 1887 Rey. John H. Chapman was added to the mission and 
the station was removed to Anvik. The present force of teachers consists of 
Rev. John W. Chapman and Mr. Marcus O. Cherry. 
In 188687 the Roman Catholics entered the Yukon Valley, and have estab- 
lished missions and schools at Nulato, Kosoriffsky, and Cape Vancouver. 
In 1886 the Evangelical Mission Union of Sweden established astation among 
the Eskimos at Unalaklik with Rev. Axel E. Karlson, missionary. He isnowas- 
sisted by Mr. August Anderson, and it is proposed that next year the school will 
be assisted by the United States Bureau of Education. 
The new stations among the Arctic Eskimos at Point Barrow, Point Hope, 
and Cape Prince of Wales, have already been mentioned. During the summer 
of 1890 I established three schools and missions in Arctic Alaska. One at Point 
Barrow, with Mr. Leander M. Stevenson, of Versailles, Ohio, in charge. This 
is, next to Upernavik, Greenland, the northernmost mission in the world. Its 
establishment was made possible through the liberality of Mrs. Elliott F. Shep- 
ard. Mr. Stevenson,-who volunteered to go to that distant point, organize the 
' mission and erect the necessary buildings, will return in the summer of 1892 to 
his family. A permanent missionary for that place is desired. He should be a 
young married man, and both his wife and himself should be of sound constitu- 
tion and good bodily health. They should be of acheerful disposition, ‘‘ handy” 
with various kinds of tools and work, ready in resources, and possess good prac- 
tical common sense. A consecrated Christian physician accustomed to evangel- 
ical work would be more useful than an ordained minister without the medical 
training. Applicants can address me at the United States Bureau of Education, 
Washington, D.C. They will not be expected to leave home until the spring 
of 1892. The Point Barrow Mission is under the auspices of the Presbyterian 
Board of Home Missions. 
The second school in the Arctic is at Point Hope, and is under the supervision 
of the Protestant Episcopal Church. The teacher is Mr. John B. Driggs, M.D. 
The third is at Cape Prince of Wales, Bering Straits, with Messrs. H. R. Thorn: 
ton and W.T.Lopp, teachers. It is under the control of the American Mission- 
ary Association of the Congregational Church.

  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
    1295 
In the harbor at Unalaska, in September, 1890, lay at anchor the revenue cut- 
ters Bear and Rush. The Bear was soon to return to the northward and cruise 
around the Seal Islands ; the Rush toarrest two men accused of murder, and convey 
them to the United States district court at Sitka. As the Mush was to call in at 
the principal villages en route, and would afford me an opportunity of inspect- — 
ing the schools at Unga, Kadiak, Afognak, and Southeastern Alaska, Capt. W. 
C. Coulson kindly invited me to take passage with him. Accordingly on the 
6th of September, I removed my quarters from the Bear to the Rush, taking 
with me the boys William and George Fredericks, and M. Healy Wolff. We 
were to have sailed at 3 p.m., on the 7th, but a southeast gale prevailing out- 
side, the captain concluded to remain at anchor. It was nearly a week before 
the storm abated and we got started. After getting outside of the harbor the 
fog shut down so thick that the ship ran into the harbor of Akatan. Thisis a 
small village of 87 souls, 34 of whom are children, and greatly in need of a     
school. They live in the barabaras, or native sod houses. The Alaska Com- 
mercial Company have a small store at the place.. The people are exceedingly ~ 
poor; their whole catch for the pastsummer was 19sea otters. This represents 
the moneyed support of the whole village for12 months. In addition to the 
clothing and supplies which the otter skins procure them atthe store, the bay —— 
yields them fish, which is their principal food. The next day we started out, 
but found the fog so dense that the ship again returned toanchorage. The sec- — 
ond attempt was more successful, and we passed from Bering Sea into the North 
Pacific Ocean. Turning to the eastward, we steamed past the volcano of Shis- 
haldin, its beautiful top covered with snow and its smoking crater alike hid in 
the clouds. On Sabbath we were abreast of Belkofski, at one time the richest | 
village in Alaska. With the decline of the sea-otter trade its people are much” 
impoverished. The population is about 250. This is one of the villages where 
a good school should be established as soon as the annual appropriation will jus- 
tify it. Our stay at this place was just long enough for the surgeon to go ashore ~ 
and visit the sick. That night we dropped anchor in Coal Harbor. Monday 
morning found us at Pirate Cove, a cod-fishing station of Lynd & Hough, of San 
Francisco. It was understood that a Mr. Clark, accused of murder, was there 
waiting to give himself up.. Not finding him at that place we passed on to Sand. 
Point, another fishing station, and from thence to Unga, where he was found. — 
At Unga I made a thorough inspection of the school property and school sup- 
plies. The school was not in session, but anumber of the children were brought 
together and examined. A meeting of the parents wasalso called and a general 
conference had with regard to school matters. Monday evening, with the pris- 
oner and two witnesses on board, we sailed for Kadiak, which we reached early 
Wednesday morning. In company with Mr. Roscoe, the teacher, an inspection 
was made of the new schoolhouse, and many educational matters discussed and 
considered. During the forenoon, a pilot having been secured, the captain 
steamed over to Afognak, in order that I might visit that school also. The 
school being in session, an opportunity was afforded of seeing the good work 
done at that village by Mr. Duif, the teacher. A comfortable school building 
and teacher’s residence had been erected during the summer. Returning to 
Kadiak, the evening was spent with friends. At Kadiak a creole accused of 
assault with intent to kill was taken on board, to be conveyed to Sitka for trial. 
His victim was taken along for medical treatment and as a witness. 
Mr. M. L. Washburn, superintendent of the interests of the Alaska Commer- 
cial Company, gave me for the collection of the Alaska Society of Natural His- 
tory an ancient Eskimo stone lamp that had been dug up on one of the islands. 
The traditions of the people are that 400 years ago their fatherscamefrom Ber- 
ing Sea and settled Kadiak Island, which theyfound uninhabited. The Eskimo ~ 
settlements of the North Pacific coast extend from Nuchek Island on the east — 
to Mitrofania Island on the west. On the trails between two settlements are — 
frequently found at the highest point two heaps of stones, from 50 to 70 feet - 
apart. These heaps are from 4 to 6 feet high, and were many yearsin building. 
Their purpose is not known. Every passer-by was expected to add a stone to © 
the heap, but the custom of late years seems to have fallen into disuse. : 
There is a very pleasant custom connected with the stone heaps and stone 
lamp. A couple engaged to be married select a stone suitable for the manufac- 
ture ofalamp. This stone, with a flint chisel, is deposited at the foot of one of | 
the stone heaps. Parties carrying loads or traveling from one city or another 
naturally sit down to rest at the stone heap at the topof the hill. Spying the 
stone, the traveler says to himself, ‘‘My hands may as well work while my feet 
rest. As some one worked my lamp, I will work for some oneelse.” And pick- 
ing up the flint, with a song, he chisels away at the stone. When he is rested, 
       
-P-A-G-E-704
          1296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
i 
he lays down the stone and chisel and goes on his way. The next traveler re- 
peats the operation, and the next, and the next, until in about two years the 
lamp is done which will last hundreds of years. Thus the whole community 
shows its good will to the young couple. In these lamps they burn seal oil, with 
a cotton wick. If the cotton can not be procured, then the wick is a bit of moss. 
In former days, as soon as one iamp was finished and removed, another stone 
was placed there, so that one was always in process of making. These lamps 
furnish both light and heat. 
Early Thursday morning, September 17, the captain weighed anchor and put 
out to sea, bound for Sitka. During the day the wind increased to a gale, and on 
Friday night the sea was so rough that the ship was hove to, and oil was strained 
over the bows into the sea to lessen the force of the waves. Nearly the entire 
trip of a week across to Sitka was in the face of a heavy equinoctial storm. It 
was so rough that several times the table could not be set in the captain’s cabin, 
and we took our meals in our hands in the pilot house as best we could. Off 
Mount. Edgecombe, the ship was again compelled to heave to. However, we 
finally reached the quiet harbor of Sitka on Thursday, September 25, and the 
rough part of our journey was over. The remainder of our journey was made in 
the smooth waters of the Alexandrian Archipelago. 
I remained two weeks at Sitka, attending to school matters. Then being 
joined there by the Hon. James Sheakley, superintendent of schools in the Sitka 
district, we made a tour of inspection through southeastern Alaska, visiting, 
either separately or together, every school in that district, except those at Met- 
lakahtla and Klawack. 
At Chilkat a location was selected and arrangements completed for the erec- 
tion of a cheap but substantial log schoolhouse. On November 11 I reached 
Washington, after an absence of seven months, having traveled 17,825 miles. 
The success of the long trip was greatly promoted by the many facilities that 
were extended by Capt. Michael A. Healy, of the steamer Bear, and Capt. W. 
C. Coulson, of the steamer Rush, with whom I sailed, also of the several. officers 
of their command. 
NEW OFFICERS. 
In accordance with the provisions of the rules approved by the Secretary of 
the Interior April 9, 1890, the following persons have been appointed to com- 
mence service on July 1, 1890: 
The members of the school committees will continue in office until June 30 of 
the year set against their names. 
__ Assistant agent, William Hamilton; superintendent for Sitka district, Hon. 
James Sheakley.

VISITORS. 
Of late years tourists have commenced to learn of the attractiveness of the 
trip from Puget Sound to southeastern Alaska, and increasing numbers from 
year to year are availing themselves of it. This season over 5,000 round-trip 
tickets have been sold. As the steamer fare from Puget Sound up and return 
is $100, only the wealthier and better classes make the trip. 
It is a cause for regret that the tourist season occurs during the vacation,of 
the schools. If the tourists could see the schools in actual operation it would 
greatly assist in creating a healthy public sentiment that would react in favor 
of larger appropriations by Congress. As it is, the industrial school at Sitka, 
which is in continuous operation, is the only one visited, This, however, shows 
what can be done, and is an object lesson that will not be forgotten by tourists.

  EDUCATION IN ALASKA, LAO 
One of them, after describing her visit to the homes of the natives and the sick- 
ening filth and squalor which she witnessed in Alaska, writes: 
“And now, quite by accident, I had the most interesting experience of my 
whole trip, certainly one that has made an everlasting impression on my mind; 
an object lesson which often and often will set me thinking, a subject which 
would require a volume to do it approximate justice. The joyous shouting of 
half a hundred boys, some of them dashing across the road in pursuit of a foot- 
ball; well-clothed, well-fed boys; healthy, vigorous, intelligent boys; Indians, 
half-breeds, Muscovites, and a few Americans. What did it mean? From 
whence had they so suddenly come ? From school. These were the beneficiaries 
of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions, and the large building on the right 
of the road is the schoolhouse. 
**Of course I had read about this mission. All the books on Alaska refer to it 
more or less. Yet the knowledge of its existence had brought no special desire 
to visit the place. To me Sitka was the vestige of a departed empire; the home 
of a decaying race of aborigines; a depot for the sale of Russi-Indian relics 
and curios; a pretty little town timidly hiding away in among the mountains, 
and for that I had come to see it and had been amply repaid. But the mission I 
had never thought of. Perhaps the book-writer had failed to attract me to it; 
perhaps my faith in missions generally was not very confirmed; perhaps I did 
not believe what I read about them. Be that as it may, hereafter no man, nor 
woman either, shall outdo me in words of praise and thanks for the glorious, 
godlike work which is being performed by the good people who are rescuing 
the lives, the bodies, and the souls of these poor creatures from the physical 
and moral deaths they are dying. I amnotaChristian woman; my faith is that 
of achosen people who were led out of Egyptian tyranny and darkness by the 
pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud; but my whole nature is in accord with these 
Christian men and women, whose immolation and sacrifices to regenerats their 
fellow-creatures will surely meet with heavenly reward, no matter what their 
creed. I wish I had had more time at my disposal to spend with the teachers 
and the scholars, so that I might now give even a skeleton outline of their daily 
life. 
‘«There are about 100 boys and 50 girls in the institution, some of them being 
only 3 years of age and others as old as 22. The boys are instructed in carpen- 
try, shoemaking, and blacksmithing; the girls are taught dressmaking and the 
use of the sewing machine. I went first into one of the class rooms, where I saw 
perhaps 20 dark-skinned Siwash Indian boys, whose Mongolian faces and almond- 
shaped eyes had assumed an expression of intelligence so different from the 
stupid, blear-eyed appearance of the same age and race whom I had seen in the 
rancherie that it was difficult to realize that they could possibly be twigs of the 
same tree. Upstairs we found the dormitories, like everything else about the 
establishment, orderly, neat, clean, due regard being paid to the number al- 
lotted to each room and to the subject of heating and ventilation. In the sew- 
ing department were several girls operating skillfully upon the sewing machine, 
others cutting from the piece, and younger ones basting for the sewing girls. 
“Tt is said somewhere that it is only a single step from civilization to bar- 
barism. Perhapsso; but I, and those ladies and gentlemen who accompanied 
me through the rancherie and the schools at Sitka, can vouch for the fact that 
it is only half a mile from savage, uncivilized ignorance, superstitution, filth, 
and immorality to education, deportment, thrift, domestic felicity, and all 
human happiness.”

RECOMMENDATIONS. 
The three most urgent needs of educationin Alaska at present are: 
FIRST—LARGER APPROPRIATIONS. 
Fifty thousand dollars isasum wholly inadequate for the establishing and m: 
taining of good schools for the 10,000 children of Alaska. ‘The utmost care 
taken to make it goas far as possible, and yet a number of communitiesare as! 
ing for schools, which can not be granted because of the insufficiency of the a 
propriation. I would most respectfully recommend that an appropriation 
$75,000 be asked for the coming year. 
The efficiency of the school service would be greatly increased if a permane: 
appropriation could be made for a term of five years, which would increase ij 
regular amounts up to $100,000. This would enable the Bureau of Education 
keep pace with the steady growth of the work: It would also enable the Co: 
missioner of Educationto more wisely plan his work.
-P-A-G-E-707
  _- EDUCATION IN ALASKA. - 1299 
‘The appropriation for education in Alaska is placed in the sundry civil bill, 
Every alternate year during the long session of Congress this bill isnotenacted 
into law before July, August, or September. But the last vessel for the year that 
communicates with the teachers in northwestern Alaska leaves San Francisco 
about the Ist of June. Consequently the Commissioner of Education can notap- 
point teachers for thatsection until ten or twelve months of the school year have 
expired. Or, inother words, the teachers are compelled -to teach the entire 
‘school year without knowing whether any appropriation has bzen made to pay 
them. This is an injustice to the Commissioner of Nducation and to the teachers. 
SECOND—OBLIGATORY ATTENDANCE. 
There is no one subject connected with the Alaska schools that teachers, su- 
rintendents, committeemen, and citizens are more united upon than that the 
dighest interests of the children and the schools require that there should be 
some authoritative regulations that will secure the more regular attendance of 
the native children. Attention has been called to this in every annual report. 
Mr. John H. Keatley, ex-judge of the United States district court of Alaska 
and ex-member of the Territorial board of education for Alaska, in an article 
in the Atlantic Monthly for August, 1890,.on ‘‘The Race Problem in Alaska,” 
Says : : 
x The natives of Alaska realize that everything is changing about them, and 
are anxious to pattern after the whites in better dwellings, more comfortable 
clothing, and a greater diversity of food, but they fail to realize yet the im- 
portance ofeducation. The adults are serious obstacles to the education of the 
children, and no radical change is possible until attendance at the Government 
schools iscompulsory. Itis not enough to provide schools and teachers at the 
pee expense, but Congress must go further and authorize the employment of 
ndian policemen at every village to compel the attendance of the children. 
“Some of the native schools have an enrollment of 60 pupils,’ with an average 
daily attendance of 10. “This is due to the total lack of means of enforcing at- 
tendance. The race problem presented in the subject.of their education and - 
possible participation in the political affairs of the country is of too serious a 
character to be thus ignored by those who are now responsible for their future 
development.” 
THIRD—AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
Passing from northern Alaska, with its adaptation to reindeer-raising, we find 
the whole southern coast, stretching for thousands of miles, to possess a. tem- 
perate ‘climate. This is due to the “ Kuro-siwo” or {‘ Japan Current” of the 
Pacific Ocean. In this ‘‘temperate belt” it is probable that there are areas of 
greater or less extent that areadapted toagriculture. Atleast it is known that 
there are small farms or vegetable gardens on Kadiak and Afognak Islands, on’ 
the shores of Cook’s Inlet, and in southeastern Alaska. It is also known that 
wild berries grow in great profusion and abundance in many sections. But no 
intelligent and continued experiments have b2en made to test the agricultural 
and horticultural capabilities of the country. 
Until a quite recent period (1867) the European population were fur-trading 
Russians. They were followed by fur-trading Americans, and more recently by 
the gold-ssekers. No one expected to remain long in the country, and there 
has been no incentive to carry forward intelligent experiments in agriculture. 
As early as my first report to the Commissioner of Education (1885) I called 
attention to-the fact that there was a very wide diversity of views concerning 
the agricultural and horticultural capabilities of Alaska, and necessarily very 
great ignorance; that no systematic effort intelligently prosecuted had ever 
been made to ascertain what could or what could not be raised to advantage; 
that it was of very great importance, both to the people of Alaska and the coun- 
try at large, that careful experiments should be made, extending over a term. 
of years, to ascertain the vegetables, grains, grasses, berries, apples, plums, 
|, trees, flowers, etc., best adapted tothe country; the best methods of cultivating, 
gathering, and curing the same; the planting and grafting of fruit trees; the 
development of the wild cranberry; cattle, hog,and poultry raising; butter and 
cheese-making, etc. In 1886 my recommendation was taken up by the U.S. 
Commissioner of Agriculture, who, in his annual report for that year (page 20) 
says: ‘‘ Something in the line of experimental work might also be undertaken 
      
1This is true of a few, not of many schools. 
‘ @ Z 
   
-P-A-G-E-708
        1300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90+ 
in Alaska, possibly with profit. It is well known that the Department of the 
Interior has established an agency for the promotion of education in that terri- 
tory.” 
“Tt has been suggested that a line of experiments, to be undertaken by this 
Department, would easily prove whatever of agricultural and horticultural ca- 
pability may exist in the Territory. No careful attention seems to have been 
given there, as yet, to this branch of industry, and the resources of the coun- 
try are quite unknown and undeveloped. 
“The industrial training school at Sitka would furnish an admirable basis 
for a station, where could be conducted careful experiments to ascertain the 
agricultural products best adapted to the climate and soil of the Territory, and 
ent breeds of cattle and other domestic animals are most suited to its climate 
and soil. 
“Such an experiment ought to extend over a series of years, and the result 
would amply repay any expenditure that Congress may choose to make in this 
direction.” : 
In view, therefore, of the national importance of introducing the domesti- 
cated reindeer of Siberia into northern Alaska, and testing the agricultural 
capacity of southern Alaska, I most earnestly recommend that you secure the 
establishment of an ‘‘agricultural school and experiment station” in connec- 
tion with the system of industrial education in Alaska. 
By an act approved July 2, 1862, Congress made provision for schools for the 
‘benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts.” _By an act approved March 2, 
1887, provision was made for “agricultural experiment stations” in connection 
with the agricultural schools. And by the act approved August 30, 1890, cer- 
tain of the proceeds of the sale of public lands were set aside for the better sup- 
port of these agricultural schools. : 
These acts of Congress require the assent of the legislature of the State or 
Territory in order that their provisions may become available. : 
But Alaska has no legislature, and is governed directly by Congress. On this 
account, and partly because nineteen-twentieths of the children to be benefited 
belong to the native races, Congress has committed to the Secretary of the In- 
zerior the duty of making ‘‘needfuland proper provision for education in Alaska.” 
would therefore recommend that an application be made to Congress to direct 
he Secretary of the Interior to extend to Alaska the benefits of the agricultural 
acts of 1887 and 1890, and secure the establishment of aschool that can introduce 
reindeer into that region, and teach their management, care, and propagation, 
and also to conduct a series of experiments to determine the agricultural capa- 
bilities of the country. 
To reclaim and make valuable vast areas of land otherwise worthless; to in- 
troduce large, permanent, and wealth-producing industries where none pre- 
viously existed; to take a barbarian people on the verge of starvation and lift 
them up to acomfortable self-support and civilization, is certainly a work of 
national importance. 
In the closing year of the existence of the Territorial board of education the 
fullowing rules were enacted, viz: 
First. From and after this date (October 27, 1888), corporal punishment in the 
public schools of Alaska is entirely and wholly prohibited. i 
Second. All religious services are prohibited in all the public schools of Alaska 
except Howkan Klawack, Metlakahtla, Fort Wrangell, Juneau No. 2, and Haines. 
The above rules were carried by the deciding vote of the chairman. If Mr. 
Dunean, the absent member of the board had been present, they could not have 
been passed. 
With the reorganization of the Alaska school system on April 9, 1890, the 
above rules were rescinded, and both school punishments and religious exercises 
left discretionary with the teacher and the local school committee. 
To stillfurther popularize the schools and create in the several communities 
a feeling of responsibility for the conduct of the schools and a personal interest 
in their success, I would recommend thatin the villages containing a number of 
white people, such asJuneau, Sitka, and Douglas, the voters be allowed to elect’ 
their local school committee, and said committee be authorized to select teach- 
ers of the white schools, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion. 
Iremain with great respect, yours, truly, 
SHELDON JACKSON, 
General Agent of Education for Alaska.

Commissioner of Education.

childhood. Some of the wisest philanthropists joined him, and he found his 
life work. Boys and girls in need were taken in, and an effort made to elevate 
them. Lodging houses, newsboys’ homes, night schools, free reading rooms, 
fresh air fund, and summer resorts were established. In his last report it ap- 
pears that over 200,000 had been received at the lodging houses, over 70,000 
had been transplanted to country homes, and not a few had risen to places of 
responsibility. The expenditure for that year reached $366,998.26. He wasa 
correspondent of this Bureau and the Commissioner appealed to him to plant 
similar organizations in all of our large cities, but he did not see his way to 
the undertaking.

NOTE EXPLANATORY OF TABLE ON FOLLOWING PAGES. 
Nore.—I. The Manual Method.—The sign language, the manual alphabet, and writing are the chief means used in the instruction of the pupils. Il. he Oral Method.—Articulation and speech-reading, together with writing, are made the chief 
means of instruction, and facility in articulation and speech-reading, as well as mental development 
and written language, is aimed at. Signs are used as little as possible, and the manual alphabet is 
generally discarded altogether. There is a difference in different schools in the extent to which the use of natural signs is allowed in the early part of the course, and also in the prominence given to . ‘writing as an auxiliary to articulation and speech-reading in the course of instruction. II. The Combined System. Articulation and speech-reading are regarded as very important, but mental development and the acquisition of language are regarded as still more important. A. The general instruction of the } upils is carried on chiefly by the manual method. Part of them 
receive special training in articulation and speech-reading. AB. Part of them are taught by the manual method, others by the oral method. Of the former, 
part receive special training in articulation and speech-reading. All are permitted to mingle freely with one another out of school hours. 
AE. The general instruction of the pupils is carried on chiefly by the manual method. Part of them receive special training in articulation and speech-reading. Some of the teachers also use artic- 
ulation and speech-reading in addition to the manual alphabet and writing as a means of instruction 
with part of their pupils. B. Some of the pupils are taught by means of the manual method and others by the oral method. These two classes are permitted to mingle freely with one another out of school hours. BG. Some of the pupils are taught by means of the manual method, and others by the oral method. Of the latter, part are permitted to mingle freely out of school hours with the manually taught pupils; others are kept entirely separate from them and from those who mingle with them out of school hours 
“as well as in the schoolrooms. 
C. Some of the pupils are tanght by means of the manual method and others by the oral method. 
‘These two classes are kept entirely separate out of school hours as well as in the schvolrooms. 
D. The general instruction of the pupils is carried on chiefly by means of the manual alphabet and 
writing without the use of the sign language. All the pupils receive special training in articulation and eye rad ng 
B. Tho sign language, the manual alphabet, writing, articulation, and speech-reading are all used as means of instruction by the same teachers and with the same pupils. Be neadition. to one or more of the methods above described, auricular training is given to a part 
of the pupils.

    EDUCATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
The following table presents the statistics of public elementary schools, #.¢., 
schools intended for children of legal school age, generally 6 to 14 years, and 
supported wholly or in part by public funds. In a few instances the statistics 
are not strictly limited to these bounds. : 
For France, as will be seen by reference to columns 3 and 4,the enrollment 
in private elementary schools, which derive nothing from public funds, is in- 
cluded. As these schools are, however, under government inspection they 
pertain in a certain sense to the public system. For England and Wales and 
Scotland the enrollment includes pupils in infant schools and classes. Of the 
number tabulated, for the former 9 per cent. and for the latter 2.42 per cent. were 
under 5 years of age. . 
In Ireland only those pupils on the rolls who make at least one attendance in 
the fortnight preceding the government examination are included in the num- 
ber recognized for the government payments. This number and the total en- 
rollment for the year are both tabulated (see column 5). Private schools not 
aided by public funds are included in the enrollment for the Netherlands. The 
latest official statistics from Finland, 7. e., for 1889-90, give a very imperfect 
notion of the actual state of instruction in that country, as they include only 
organized schools, whereas the larger proportion of the population receive the 
elements of knowledge through the agency of ambulatory schools. The statis- 
tics of these as reported in 1886 are, therefore, given (see column 5). Z 
The statistics of Upper Burmah, whose schools have recently b2en brought 
under the supervision of English officials, include 8,685 ptipils in strictly private 
schools. For the remaining provinces of India the tabulated statistics include 
only public primary schools. The reports received show also an attendance in 
private native schools of elementary grade as follows: Bengal, 77,286; Bombay, 
67,123; Lower Burmah, 35,003; North West Provinces and Oudh, 70,061; Mysore, ~ 
22,162. 
Peculiar difficulties are encountered in the attempt to tabulate the current 
expenditures for elementary education. . In some instances these are given in 
financial reports separate from the educational, and pertaining to a different 
year. Often the total expenditure for education is given without itemizing, so 
that the amounts devoted to the elementary schools can not be determined; 
thus, for example, in Russia in 1891 the school budgets of the different ministers 
having charge of educational institutions amounted toabout $23,000,000, the pro- 
portion for elementary education not being separable. 
In Roumania in 1891 the total budget for the various grades of education was 
$3,580,921. ; 
The total expenditures are not made up in every case solely from public funds, 
governmental and local, church subsidies and tuition fees being often sources of” 
revenue. In the German-speaking countries tuition fees form only an insignifi- 
cant item in the total expenditure. In 1888 the principle of free education was 
established by law in Prussia, and is being carried into effect as rapidly as cir- 
cumstances permit. In Belgium while subsidized private schools comprise 29 
per cent of the enrolled pupils, tuition fees afford about 5,22. per centof the total 
elementary school income, the maintenance of forty-nine normal schools being 
included therein. 
About 25 per cent of the reported school expenditure for England and Wales 
was made up from tuition fees, which this year, for the last time, form an ap- 
preciable part of the income, the law providing for the remission of fees having 
gone into operation September, 1891. Scotland has completed a year’s experi- 
ment in free education. Tuition fees are required in the public schools of the 
following British colonies represented in the table: Quebec, New South Wales, 
South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, Mauritius, Trinidad, Jamaica, 
and the provinces of India,

  EDITOR’S PREFACE. 
The problem of mental discipline, of determining under 
what conditions, by what methods and to what extent 
training received in a given line of mental activity spreads 
to other lines of mental activity, is acknowledged to be 
the central problem of educational psychology. The an- 
swer that experimental investigation affords to this prob- 
lem is acknowledged to possess a most significant bearing 
upon several cardinal problems in education. Thus, for 
instance, the arrangement of the curriculum, particularly 
in the high school, the designation of prescribed courses 
in both high school and college, the selection of methods 
of instruction in various subjects—all these things depend 
in part upon what we know about the nature of mental 
discipline. 
Dr. Rugg’s monograph claims attention for two reasons 
especially: (1) it presents in a compact semi-tabular form 
a valuable and comprehensive summary of all the experi- 
mental work that has been done upon formal discipline 
to date; (2) it presents the results of the author’s own 
investigation, which is conspicuous because it deals with 
a large number of subjects (students in the University — 
of Illinois), and because it measures the effect upon mental 
efficiency produced by a course of instruction (descriptive” 
geometry). carried on under regular classroom conditions. 
The demonstration of a certain degree of transfer of train- 
ing is of real importance both in educational theory and 
practice.

THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF MENTAL 
DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Summary or THe Aims, Meruops, AND RESULTS OF THIS 
MonocrapPH. 
The aim of Chapter I is to present in complete, tabular 
and statistical form the essential features of all the pub- 
lished experiments in formal discipline. To carry out this 
purpose Plates I, II, and III give the experimental mate- 
rial in detail organized under the following heads: the 
investigator, date of reporting the study, where studied, 
reference, the mental abilities under investigation, the 
subjects (adult or children), number and psychological 
training of each, description of the test and training 
series, introspective material, statistical results, conclu- 
sions, interpretation, and further interpretive comment. 
Tables I to V summarize in definite form the typical status 
of experimentation under each of these items. The con- 
clusions of Chapter I thus set forth the attitude of the 
present-day psychology on the question of the “transfer of 
training.” 
The remainder of the monograph, Chapters II-XI, pre- 
sents an experimental investigation of the effect of a 
semester’s study of descriptive geometry upon specific 
abilities in the mental manipulation of spatial elements, 
(a) of a strictly geometrical character; (b) of a quasi- 
geometrical character; (c) of a non-geometrical character. 
The general procedure was to study “transfer” by means 
of a detailed determination, through classroom experi- 
ment, of the spread of training obtained in a specific 
school course of study.

-P-A-G-E-14
2 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
Four hundred and thirteen college students in the Uni- 
versity of Illinois, ranging in age from 17 to 26 years, 
served as subjects. Three hundred and twenty-six fresh- 
men engineering students acted as the training group, 87 
juniors and seniors of the college of liberal arts and 
sciences made up the control group. Both the training 
and the control group took the test series in February and 
June. Only the training group took the training course, 
which was the regular University of Illinois course of 
study offered to engineers in descriptive geometry. In 
order to be able to isolate the cause of any residual gains 
that might possibly be found favoring the training group, 
this group was further subdivided into seven sub-sections, 
each of which was composed of those students pursuing 
like courses of study. As descriptive geometry was the 
only course pursued by all the subjects, statistical study 
could be made of the relative training value of the other 
courses pursued by the subjects. 
This training course was a semester’s study of des- 
criptive geometry, a prescribed freshman course in the 
various engineering curriculums. The course is primarily 
a course in the solution of spatial problems, involving 
visual concepts. It is taught at the University of Illinois 
primarily as a disciplinary course, as a “pure science,” 
in opposition to the commonly accepted point of view that 
it is an applied science. 
The test series consisted of six written class tests for 
ability in the mental manipulation of spatial elements; 
Numbers 1, 2, and 6 involved non-geometrical elements, 
Number 3 involved quasi-geometrical elements, and Tests 
4 and 5 involved strictly geometrical elements. Prelimi- 
nary “laboratory” tests were given during the period 
September 1912 to January 1913 to 41 subjects, and upon 
this basis the final tests used in this investigation were
-P-A-G-E-15
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 3 
constructed. The final tests were given in February and 
in June, 1913 and 1914. They were given to the subjects 
grouped in the regular teaching sections of the department 
of general engineering drawing, with careful general and 
specific directions and with classroom conditions as nearly 
normal as possible. 
The test sheets were all scored by the author and the 
original tabulations were so made up as to show the abso- 
lute amount of work done correctly by each of the subjects 
for both the February and June test-series. From these 
original tables other summary tabulations were made 
showing: (1) for each subject the per cent efficiency (Feb- 
ruary and June), the gain in efficiency, the number and 
kind of tests in which gains were made; (2) for the entire 
training and control groups the median number of prob- 
lems solved and the median gains made, the number of 
subjects making a certain number of “Attempts” and the 
per cent of this number obtaining a certain number of 
“Rights”, the number of subjects gaining in each of the 
tests in both “Attempts” and “Rights”; (3) for the train- 
ing group (to isolate the cause of residual gain) the num- 
ber of subjects gaining in each test and the amount of gain 
of each subject in each test when the subjects are grouped 
in sub-sections; (4) for the training group the correla- 
tion of abilities involved in test and training series, Feb- 
ruary and June; (5) for the training group the effect of 
training on different grades of scholastic ability, showing 
the relative number of gainers among high-grade students 
and low-grade students when grouped according to scho- 
lastic ability in (a) mathematics and (b) English and 
modern languages; (6) for the training group the effect 
of training at different levels of maturity; (7) for the 
training group the correlation of scholastic ability in 
various college studies.

4 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
Results of the investigation. 1. Statistics of initial 
efficiency of the two groups reveal the training group as 
the superior in all tests. Thus a residual gain in favor 
of the training group cannot be ascribed to a larger pos- 
sible range of progress because of a lower initial efficiency. 
2. Group efficiency. In all tests the median gain in 
attainment of the entire training group exceeds that of 
the entire control group in both “Attempts” and “Rights.” 
The residual gains in favor of the training group are 
progressively greater as one proceeds from the non-geom- 
etrical tests (Numbers 1, 2, and 6) in which the average 
residual gain is 7 per cent to the quasi-geometrical test 
(Number 38) in which the residual gain is 20 per cent, and 
to the strictly geometrical tests (Numbers 4 and 5) in 
which the residual gain is 31 per cent. 
3. Individual efficiency. (a) Number of subjects gain- 
ing. “Attempts:” in all tests, approximately 50 per cent 
more of the training subjects gain than of the control sub- 
jects. “Rights:” considerably over half again as large a 
proportion of the training group gain as of the control 
group. (b) Amount of gain. In both “Attempts” and 
“Rights” the training group gains approximately 20 per 
cent more than the control group and makes a progres- 
sively greater gain as one proceeds from the tests with 
non-geometrical elements to the tests with quasi- and 
with strictly geometrical elements. (c) Number of tests 
in which gains were made. “Attempts :” 67.8 per cent of 
the training group and 42.5 per cent of the control group 
gain in 60 per cent or more of the tests taken. “Rights:” 
72.7 per cent of the training groups and 31 per cent of 
the control group gain in 60 per cent or more of the tests 
taken.. The average per cent of tests for which gains were 
made, is for the training group: “Attempts” 63 per cent; 
“Rights” 64.5 per cent; for the control group: “Attempts”
-P-A-G-E-17
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 5 
49 per cent; “Rights” 40 per cent. In general, the train- 
ing group gains in a distinctly larger proportion of the 
tests taken than does the control group. 
4. Correlations of efficiency in the various tests (Feb- 
ruary and June). Training group: The correlations of 
ability in various tests are all positive, ranging around 
+.30. For Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, 11 out of 12 of the June 
correlations are noticeably higher than the corresponding 
correlations for the February results. Many have doubled. 
Control growp: The June correlations are practically 
identical with those obtained from the February tests. 
The correlations confirm the results found above as to the 
effectiveness of transfer, and emphasize the complexity 
of interaction of such seemingly simple mental abilities 
as the manipulation of spatial elements. 
5. Effect of the training upon students of different 
grades of scholastic ability. When the students are 
grouped on a basis of scholastic ability in disciplinary 
or “problem” courses (such as mathematics courses), the 
semester’s training received in descriptive geometry is 
found to ‘spread’ more effectively with the high-grade 
than with the low-grade students. When the students are 
grouped on a basis of scholastic ability in English and 
the modern languages, the training is found to be equally 
effective with all grades of scholastic ability This dif- 
ference suggests the possibility that the “method of trans- 
fer” is to be defined largely in terms of conceptualizing 
and organizing abilities. 
6. Effect of training on subjects of various ages. 
Within the limits represented by this study, the age of 
the subject does not seem to be a factor in determining 
the effect of training upon his ability in the mental 
manipulation of spatial elements. 
7. Correlation of scholastic ability in various college
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
studies. The scholastic abilities of the subjects, as meas- 
ured by their college marks, are positively correlated to a 
rather marked degree; the values of r, the coefficient of 
correlation, range from -++.44 to +.70. 
8. The agencies of transfer. It is concluded from the 
results of this study that the agencies of transfer are the 
following: (1) Many specific adjustments of reactions 
to familiar “cues” of visualization have tied together train- 
ing and test series and have undoubtedly acted as bonds 
or agencies through which more efficient response is made 
to a given situation. (2) An important phase of the suc- 
cessful response to a new situation is the building up of 
attitudes of orientation in the general visual field. (3) 
Practice in extending the “range of attention” has given 
increased facility in holding and manipulating a number 
of visual elements at the same time. (4) The study of the 
effect of training on various grades of scholastic ability 
points to the possible effectiveness of conceptualizing 
abilities in developing methods of analysis or attack. The 
introspective material confirms the view that these con- 
ceptualizing abilities play a part in determining the 
method of transfer. 
9. The disciplinary outcomes of school studies. The 
possibility of one disciplinary outcome of a specific school 
subject, i. e., the ability in the mental manipulation of 
spatial elements, has been established in this investigation. 
The experimenter believes that, in general, disciplinary 
outcomes of school studies will be found in the above- 
listed agencies of transfer, i. e., the development of con- 
cepts of method in analyzing ‘problem’ situations and 
organizing methods of procedure, the habitualizing of re- 
action to specific cues, the development of attitudes of 
orientation and familiarity with the type of situation to 
be met, and the extension of the range of attention.

  CHAPTER I. 
Tue EssentiaL Fuatures or THp EXPERIMENTAL Lirera- 
TURE OF MENTAL DISCIPLINE. 
When William James, in his pioneer study of the “trans- 
fer of training” in the memorizing of verse (Plate I, 1) sug- 
gested that the psychologist and the educationist apply 
the experimental method to the solution of problems of 
formal discipline, a new line of attack was marked out. 
The ‘arm-chair’ philosophy, which for twenty centuries 
had settled @ priori all questions of the disciplinary values 
of studies, now gave way to an experimental laboratory 
method. The literature developed rapidly; the philosoph- 
ical educationists still continued to add to its volume 
through their “symposiums” and through their critiques 
of the various empirical attacks on the problem. Thus, 
after a quarter-century of empirical discussion, students 
of mental discipline are beginning to reach certain com- 
mon grounds of agreement. 
To the careful, trained student of the literature, wading 
laboriously through study after study, the outcome may 
be a fairly definite classification of experiments, methods, 
subjects, tests, statistical results, conclusions, and inter- 
pretations. It may be that such a specialist can carry 
away from months of intensive study of transfer a clear 
composite picture of the possibilities and methods of im- 
proving related and unrelated mental abilities. But to 
the beginner in the study of education the problem is 
daily becoming more and more complex. A rapidly grow- 
- ing experimental literature calls for new methods of pres- 
entation, classification, and interpretation. In the belief 
7
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
that there is a real need for a thoroughly comprehensive 
and yet definitely organized presentation of the experi- 
mental literature of formal discipline, the author aims 
in this chapter to present a graphic summary of all the 
experimental work that has been published in this field. 
The aim is to present the essential facts in a form that 
will clearly reveal their implications, and thus to supply 
the student with a guide to his study of the problem, 
through a graphic and more logical organization of the 
facts than is to be found in the many detailed summaries 
now in print. The data will be presented in tabular and 
statistical form and the interpretations will be brief. 
To carry out this plan, the essential features of the pub- 
lished literature of formal discipline are presented on 
Plates I, II, and III, and in still further summarized 
form in Tables I to V. It is believed that we have now 
reached the place where it is justifiable to apply the sta- 
tistical method to the study of the literature itself. In- 
deed, probably the most efficient study of the experimental 
results will come from a preliminary quantitative classi- 
fication of the work that has already been done. 
On Plates I to III the experimental data have been 
organized under the following heads: the mental abilities 
studied, the method of study, the number of subjects— 
total, ‘training, and ‘control’—ages and psychological 
training of the subjects, description of the test and train- 
ing series, statistical results, introspective data for the 
study of the agencies of transfer, the experimenter’s in- 
terpretations, conclusions, and further interpretative com- 
ment. The writer is alone responsible for the method of 
tabular presentation, the reading and organization of

10 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
material contained in these studies, and the transcription 
of their essential features on the large plates.* 
Following the more obvious methods of organization, 
the studies are grouped under three main heads: (a) 
studies dealing with memory abilities; (b) studies deal- 
ing with sensory, perceptual and associative motor habits; 
(c) studies dealing with the specific processes involved in 
certain school subjects. 
We proceed at once to an analysis of the experimental 
literature. 
Prior to any experimental study of mental abilities and 
the transfer of improvement in their training, psycholo- 
gists gave us a few physiological studies of so-called 
‘transfer’ in the case of bilaterally symmetrical organs. 
These studies have sometimes been quoted as offering evi- 
dence bearing on the problem of mental discipline. The 
writer believes, with Thorndike, that the argument by 
analogy for the transference of training of mental abili- 
ties, based on these physiological studies, is an improper 
one, and does not contribute to the solution of our prob- 
lem. As Thorndike says: “The phenomena of cross-edu- 
cation are an interesting chapter in experimental psy- 
chology, but are not fair samples of the general facts we 
seek.” 
From Table I it is clear that only within the past decade 
has any attempt been made to study mental discipline by 
*It is recognized that in the organization and transcription of so 
complex a mass of data the chance of occasional error is large. It 
may be said, however, that the collection of material and the or- 
ganizing and lettering of the plates have been carefully checked 
several times. It is believed that all errors of consequence have 
been eliminated, and that the student may safely use the presenta- 
tion as a definite and comprehensive guide for the study of the ex- 
perimental literature of transfer. The work has been done with 
the recognition of the fact that the investigations permit only 
partially the definite type of classification represented by these 
plates and tables. The presentation is to be regarded only as a 
device to aid the student in formulating his information.

12 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
reference to experimentation with schoolroom activities. 
In fact, ten years elapsed following James’ indication of 
non-transference before a concerted attempt to work out 
the problem in the laboratory was reported. This labora- 
tory phase of the movement has engaged the attention of 
most of the investigators since 1900. The work has been 
done principally in connection with so-called ‘peripheral’ 
functions, more or less isolated perceptual and sensory 
processes, and, in general, quite apart from the concrete 
and complex situations of actual mental life. More recent 
investigators are recognizing the inadequacy of the former 
attack and are concerning themselves with the classroom 
problem. It would seem that the application of the results 
of transfer studies to the advancement of school practice 
can be of immediate value only when the studies them- 
selves have to do with school practice, are conducted under 
normal school conditions and deal with ‘real’ mental situa- 
tions such as are met with in our school practice and in 
our daily mental life. 
Table II summarizes the data concerning the subjects 
used in the transfer studies. They are characterized by 
three important features: (1) the subjects have nearly 
always been adults; (2) they have been few in number; 
(3) they have been a highly selected class, usually teach- 
ers of psychology or students with considerable psycho- 
logical training. In only nine experiments have children 
been tested and studied. From the point of view of edu- 
cational practice this is to be regretted and it is to be 
hoped that future experimenters will take notice of this 
need. Furthermore, the number of subjects in most in- 
vestigations has been so small as to render questionable 
the generalizations that have been made in interpreting 
the results of the experimentation and in drawing infer- 
ences for school practice. In 12 of the 30 experiments, 
the number of subjects was six or less. The few class-  
-P-A-G-E-25
  
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES ‘13 
room experiments have been characterized by a large 
number of subjects, usually 20 to 50. 
The use of control groups for the determination of the 
effect of (a) «practice in the test series, (b) increased 
maturity, and (¢) familiarity with experimental condi- 
tions is rather recent in experimentation. The experi- 
ments in memory by Fracker, in motor response by Schol- 
kow and Judd, and the studies of Bagley and Ruediger 
in connection with practical school activities were the first 
to take account of these factors. As is indicated on 
Plates I to III, the conclusions of certain of the experi- 
ments are invalidated by the neglect of the experimenter 
properly to control his experiment. Particularly is this 
true of James’ study and of the extensive memory investi- 
gation of Ebert and Meumann. The more extensive 
studies, and particularly the classroom studies, are little 
open to criticism on this score. 
Psychological training of the subjects. Nothing shows 
more clearly the selected nature of the subjects of the 
transfer investigations than the status of their psycholog- 
ical training. The laboratory experiments have nearly 
all been performed on trained psychologists, graduate 
students in psychology, or persons with some psychological 
training. It might seem that their arrangement would 
afford valuable introspective analyses of the mechanism 
of transfer. That there were secured few actual contri- 
butions to the discussion of the agencies of transfer is 
shown by the table, which indicates that of 19 investiga- 
tors using subjects trained in psychology, only five were 
able to secure careful introspections, namely, Fracker, 
Coover and Angell, Whipple, Foster, and Rugg. Naturally, 
any attempt to determine the mechanism of transfer with- 
out the specific aid of the subject himself is likely to con- 
tribute but scanty suggestions for the advancement of 
school practice. On the other hand, the classroom ex-

periments have been upon children, and they have studied 
in some objective way the efficiency of certain mental proc- 
esses that are involved in specific school activities. The 
objective results may lead to a quantitative determination 
of the effect of training on school abilities. In this, how- 
ever, the experimenter faces almost insurmountable ob- 
stacles in deriving an explanation of the method of 
transfer. 
The test and training series used in various types of 
studies. What are the salient facts concerning the data 
that have been under examination in these transfer 
studies? In the first place, Tables I[Ia, IIIb, IIIc show 
the data to be extremely diverse and unorganizable. That 
is, almost none of the mental abilities studied has been 
studied by more than one investigator. We have few in- 
stances, in twenty-five years of experimentation, of either 
co-operative or independent study of the effect of train- 
ing upon the same mental abilities, and we have yet to 
find a detailed laboratory or classroom study that has 
been repeated under precisely the same conditions and in 
the identical form of the original study. 
This points to an experimental need in our work. Our 
departments of experimental education and educational 
psychology would do well to take up this problem of 
‘checking up’ those transfer experiments that seem to 
offer positive evidence on either side of the question of 
transfer. The product of a few years of organized class 
study could thus shed valuable light upon the present 
unsettled status of many of the issues. 
Another pertinent induction that may be made from the 
tables is that nearly all the abilities studied may be de- 
noted as ‘peripheral’ functions. They utilize to only a 
limited extent the higher powers of observation and rea- 
soning, and are largely inapplicable to the complex situa- 
tions of our actual every-day mental life. This important

  20 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
consideration will be taken up later in the discussion of 
the agencies of transfer. Thus, in résumé, we see that the 
abilities studied have been for the most part isolated 
peripheral funétions; they have been studied principally 
under laboratory conditions, with a few adult subjects, 
most of whom have had considerable psychological train- 
ing. 
Statistical results of the transfer ewperiments. Does 
training transfer? Under conditions of training studied 
in these thirty investigations we can answer unequivo- 
cably: There is distinct evidence for the so-called trans- 
ference of training. The experimental training of the 
abilities of either adults or school children, in either 
laboratory or schoolroom, will result in an increased effi- 
ciency on the part of the subjects, in other abilities which 
are in some way related, to the trained abilities. In these 
thirty investigations there are only four in which there is 
Weclared to have been found absolutely no evidence of 
transfer. Moreover, three of these have been partly re- 
peated or ‘checked up’ statistically, and distinct evidence 
of transfer found. On the other hand, the experimentation 
has not led to the acceptance of a belief in that wide- 
spread improvement that was expected by the old formal- 
disciplinists prior to the beginning of the experimental 
work. The results, so far, place us still in a middle 
ground. “Transfer” is an accepted experimental fact, but 
as to the extent to which training transfers and the most 
favorable conditions for its transfer, specialists are not 
always agreed. However, the assembled data on the fun- 
damental question of the method or the agencies of trans- 
fer (Table V) indicate a tendency of specialists to stress 
certain similar features in their explanation of their ex- 
perimental results. 
The investigators may be grouped in two schools: (1) 
those who believe that the effect of training is quite spe-
-P-A-G-E-33
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 21 
cific and who oppose the view that transfer can be pos- 
sible through any form of “generalization”; (2) those who 
believe that the effect of practice can be generalized. 
Numerically the latter are much the stronger. Thorndike 
and Woodworth, Sleight, Leuba and Hyde, and Wallin, 
claim that improvement can spread only through the pres- 
ence of identical ability-conditioning factors, such as 
identity in content or substance, identity in method, iden- 
tity in ideals or aim, etc. To these may be added Fracker 
and Sleight, who claim the possibility of transfer through 
identical elements, provided that the subject consciously 
recognizes and is able to use the favorable factors as such. 
This method of explaining transfer is clearly to be classed, 
however, with the “general-practice-effect” group, among 
the “ideational” factors. It should be noted that the 
identical-elements theory of explaining transfer in a way 
begs the entire question of the method of transfer. It says 
too much; it is too all-inclusive and might fairly be inter- 
preted as supporting the view of the other school. 
Out of the nineteen investigators who contribute to the 
discussion of the method of transfer (eleven others offer 
nothing to this most fundamental aspect of the problem), 
fifteen take the position that transfer is possible through 
certain factors of generalization. These factors of gen- 
eralization may be grouped as, (1) ideational factors, e.g., 
abilities in the organization of methods of procedure, con- 
ceptualizing abilities, the development of improved meth- 
ods of learning, etc.; (2) attention factors, e.g., improved 
methods of distributing attention, of concentrating, of 
extending the range of attention, (3) attitudinal factors, 
e.g., the development of attitudes of (a) orientation in 
general fields of reaction, (b) adjustment to experimental 
conditions, (¢) confidence in success, etc. Thus the bur- 
den of the argument is to the effect that transfer is pos- 
sible through the generalization of various ‘central’ func-
-P-A-G-E-34
22 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
tions. (This in itself may explain the slight amount of 
transfer that has been found, for most of the experimenta- 
tion has been upon so-called “peripheral” functions—re- 
action time, speed, and the like, in which motor co-ordina- 
tions have been of the simplest sort—those in which ‘cen- 
tral’ modes of improvement are least effective.) 
The experiments indicate that the central improvement 
consists in devising methods of learning, e.g., tricks and 
short-cuts for meeting problematic situations. As one 
writer has put it: “Our instruments do not improve; we 
only learn to use them better. Those who do not learn 
to use their instruments . . . from practice, show little 
or no transfer of improvement through practice.” It is 
pointed out that improvement should be spoken of as 
‘central’ or ‘peripheral’ rather than as ‘general’ or ‘special’ 
—as a better understanding of how to use the organs of 
sense rather than as a change in the constitution of these 
organs. The experiments show that we must distinguish 
between the ideational possibilities of transferred improve- 
ment and the vain hope of the ‘spreading’ function of 
rigidly developed sensory, perceptual, and motor adjust- 
ments. These latter have to be taken over into new situa- 
tions unchanged and can operate with increased efficiency 
only as the conscious utilization of them in combination 
has been made more effective through experience. 
Thus the studies indicate that the law of learning has 
to be made a conscious matter of ideation in order to in- 
sure any considerable amount of transferred improvement. 
The largest improvement seems to come when the subject 
discovers that certain methods are helpful. In nearly 
all these investigations we can find constant insistence 
on securing the aid of ideational devices in order to bring 
about improvement. Even identical-elements explana- 
tions, such as those offered by Thorndike and Woodworth 
can be regarded as the development of methods of attack-  
-P-A-G-E-35
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 23 
ing problems through the organizing of methods of pro- 
cedure. And it seems likely that the cases of no trans- 
fer may be accounted for on the ground that the situ- 
ation had not been raised, or could not be raised, to the 
plane of conscious effort. 
Summary. 
In résumé, let us list the fundamental outcomes of the 
experimental literature of mental discipline. 
1. Prior to 1890 no empirical study of the problem of 
mental discipline had been made, and up to 1900 only 
three studies were published. Thus, the experimentation 
in mental discipline is practically a matter of the past 
sixteen years. 
2. The studies have been primarily of ‘peripheral’ func- 
tions, as (a) studies dealing with memory abilities, (b) 
studies dealing with sensory, perceptual data or motor- 
habit-formation, (c) studies dealing with specific school 
activities. These last are few in number and of recent 
date. 
3. The method of study has been principally a labora- 
tory method. Little attempt has been made to study 
transfer through schoolroom investigation of those ‘real’ 
abilities most utilized in the activity of our mental life. 
Thus, these investigations are subject to criticism on the 
ground of the purely experimental conditions under which 
they were conducted, and generalization from them to 
actual mental situations of life is unsafe. 
4, The subjects have generally been adults, selected for 
their psychological training, and, as a rule, very few in 
number; to use fewer than six subjects has been typical 
practice. With the more recent attempts to make school- 
room investigations, school children have been selected as 
subjects; their number as a rule has been about 20, and the 
abilities studied have been connected with school activi- 
ties.
-P-A-G-E-36
24 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
5. But few experimenters have secured definite and de- 
tailed introspections to aid them in determining the agen- 
cies of transfer. 
6. The tests, like the functions studied, may be char- 
acterized as largely unreal, unique, and not closely related 
to the problem-situations of daily mental life. Like the 
conditions of investigation, they are ‘experimental’ in 
character. It should be said that they probably do meas- 
ure rather well the functions under examination. Of the 
abilities selected for testing, almost none haye been 
studied by more than one investigator. 
7. The statistical results indicate almost unanimously 
that training does transfer. Within the limits of the in- 
vestigations, the amount of transfer does not seem very 
pronounced. Judging from the best of the published in- 
vestigations, it seems possible that with more extended 
experiments a more decided amount of spread would be 
found. With a greater emphasis on the central functions 
in our selection of abilities for experimentation, we may 
well expect a larger degree of transferred improvement. 
8. By one school of specialists, training has been re- 
garded as specific in effect and transfer has been explained 
as due to “identical ability-conditioning factors.” How- 
ever, the typical attitude taken today is that practice may 
be generalized and transferred through such factors as: 
(1) ideational factors, (2) attention factors, (3) atti- 
tudinal factors. Thus, transfer is possible with central 
functions through the generalization of various ones of 
these factors. The emphasis here is on making the method 
of learning a conscious matter, the conscious organization 
of methods of procedure, the conscious utilization of 
methods of improvement, better understanding of how to 
use mental tools, rather than any transferable change 
(through practice) in the constitution of the organism 
itself.

CHAPTER II. 
Descriptive GeomMETRY AND Mentat DIscipLiNne.* 
Tue ProsteM, THE METHOD AND THE ABILITIES INvESTI- 
GATED. 
A. The Problem. 
The problem is to investigate the effect of a 
semester’s training in descriptive geometry 
upon specific abilities in the mental manipu- 
lation of spatial elements, (a) of a strictly 
geometrical type; (b) of the quasi-geometri- 
cal type; (¢) of a non-geometrical type. 
That this problem is one of extreme complexity, we can- 
not doubt. When we select a regularly organized course 
of study from one of our higher college or university cur- 
riculums as material for experimental psychological analy- 
sis, we definitely put behind us the possibility of that 
exactitude of analysis and that precision in solution that 
are the goals of laboratory research. No course of study 
from our higher curriculums could be found which would 
train one specific mental ability and that alone. All 
courses exert a training effect upon countless abilities, 
such as memory, accuracy in observation, accuracy in re- 
cording auditory or visual imagery, selective judgment, dis- 
crimination of a sensory or perceptual type, etc. Our en- 
deavor, then, must be to select abilities for training whose 
activity may be well isolated and whose efficiency may be 
measured at least approximately by mental tests. 
Picture for a moment the difficult situation before the 
investigator who attempts, e. g., to determine what train- 
ing effect a year’s study of high-school algebra has upon 
*The writer wishes to acknowledge the kindness of the various 
members of the Department of General Dngineering Drawing, Uni- 
versity of Illinois, in permitting the tests to be given in their 
classes in 1913 and 1914. To Mr. F. M. Porter of this department 
he is especially indebted for hearty co-operation and many valu- 
able suggestions, and to Dr. W. C. Bagley and Dr. G. M. Whipple 
of the Department of Education for critical reading of the manu- 
script and important suggestions as to methods of treating and 
presenting the material,
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
certain mental abilities. His subjects are statistically a 
heterogeneous class, of various ages, of various previous 
training in mathematics, registered in diverse courses or 
curriculums, having a variety of daily interests and taking 
part in a variety of daily activities both in school and 
out. If he has many subjects, they are necessarily dis- 
tributed in several sections under different instructors, 
and thus subjected in their training to different organiza- 
tions of the material in the training course itself and to 
diverse methods of teaching. He further faces the diffi- 
culty of selecting a mental ability trained by his training 
course, but which other concurrently taken courses do not 
also train to an appreciable extent. Again, granted that 
the desired mental ability has been isolated for work, our 
investigator must next devise a series of mental tests 
which will be a real measure of efficiency in the selected 
ability. This, in itself, is no small task, and may well 
be the first point of attack by critics of such investigations. 
The tests once organized, the mechanism under which 
they are taken by the subjects must be standardized, 
classroom conditions kept normal, and all outside (and 
inside) influences of possible effect upon the results must 
be eliminated in the conduct of the investigation. In the 
conduct of the investigation the attitude of the subjects 
toward the investigator giving the tests must be regarded 
as an imporant phase of the mechanics of test-giving. 
A change in the prestige which the investigator has in the 
eyes of his subjects may exert a powerful influence upon 
the psychological product obtained. Another important 
phase of the test-giving is the securing from the subjects 
themselves of definite introspections on the various tests 
taken. Nothing is of so much import to the accurate 
analysis and interpretation of the statistical presentation 
of the psychological product, and yet nothing in the con-
-P-A-G-E-39
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 27 
duct of the investigation is more difficult to secure from 
students who have not been specifically trained in intro- 
spection. Going further, the very scoring and recording 
of the data—even with the aid of thorough introspections 
on the part of the subjects themselves—raises constant 
doubt as to the measurability, by certain bits of mental 
product (the test results), of the efficiency of the accom- 
panying mental process. Nothing but a continuous and 
minute oral interpretation by each subject of each of his 
tests (made and recorded immediately after taking the 
tests) would enable the judges to score accurately such 
tests, so that they would indicate the precise efficiency of 
the mental ability under observation. This, of course, is 
impossible in an extensive investigation, and to be valid, 
any such practical school investigation must be extensive. 
Finally, his tests scored and recorded, his tables and 
accompanying illustrative diagrams drawn up, our inves- 
tigator faces his last and perhaps greatest problem. From 
statistical generalizations, which his attack on the prob- 
lem may have enabled him to devise (such as averages, 
measures of dispersions, per cent efficiency, absolute quan- 
tities of work done, absolute gains of various groups, per 
cent gains of various groups, correlations between effi- 
ciency and gain of various groups, ete.), he must now in- 
terpret the efficiency and progress of the neural processes 
going on during the interval of training and test. In 
such an investigation he must ask himself such questions 
as: “Is the average net gain of my training group a meas- 
ure of its progress?” “Does the absolute quantity of work 
done typify accurately the efficiency of my individual sub- 
jects in the mental ability studied?” The way in which 
the investigator answers these questions, the insight which 
he brings to the psychologic-statistical problem, the cau- 
tion which he displays in adhering to a strict interpreta-

tion of his specific test-results—these will largely deter- 
mine the validity of his investigation and its value for the 
advancement of practical school education. 
B. General Procedure. 
Our method may be roughly denoted as the classroom- 
experimental method in distinction to the laboratory 
method so often used in studies of transfer. The selected 
ability will first be trained (in as large a group of indi- 
viduals as can be secured) by a semester’s study in a regu- 
larly prescribed course of study in one of our higher cur- 
riculums. (This will be known hereafter as “the training 
course.”) To determine efficiency in the ability before the 
training commences, a series of mental tests (known as 
“the test series”) will be taken by the subjects—tests so 
designed as to offer a measure of efficiency in the ability 
under training. The subjects may be broadly classified 
as (1) “the training group” (those taking the training 
course of study), (2) “the control group” (those not tak- 
ing the training course). Both groups will take the test 
series immediately before the commencement of the train- 
ing series and again at its conclusion. The tests will be 
identical for both groups, and in both series will be taken 
under as nearly identical classroom conditions as it is 
possible to secure. 
Granted that the tests do adequately measure efficiency 
in the ability studied, that the subjects of both the train- 
ing and control groups satisfy the statistical criterion of 
a random selection (e. g., in this case that they have been 
chosen at random by entire instructor-sections and not 
consciously selected for the presence or lack of any certain 
ability), that the mechanics of test-givjng has been im- 
peccable and that the classroom conditions have been 
maintained identical in all tests; that the attitude of  
-P-A-G-E-41
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 29 
each of the subjects has been such that his best effort 
would be put forth on each of the tests—we may then feel 
confident that a comparison of the statistical results ob- 
tained from the training group with those obtained from 
the control group will offer evidence of a character avail- 
able for the discussion of transfer of training or spread 
of improvement from one mental ability to other mental 
abilities. poe 
CO. The Abilities Investigated. 
“To determine the effect of a semester’s training in 
descriptive geometry upon the abilities of college students 
in the mental manipulation of spatial elements.” By 
abilities in mental manipulation we shall mean the quick- 
ness and accuracy with which the verbal description of 
different types of spatial elements (whether plane figures 
or three-dimensional objects) raises in consciousness and 
maintains and manipulates in consciousness a correspond- 
ing mental picture or spatial “visual image.” 
For purposes of our discussion, therefore, the general- 
ized ability in mental manipulation (it may be specifically 
of any one of the three types under consideration) has a 
threefold connotation; first, the focalization in conscious- 
ness of the image or the calling-up of the mental picture; 
second, the maintaining of this image or the concentration 
on this image in consciousness to the exclusion of other 
distracting elements; third, such manipulation of the 
image and its constituent parts as is necessary to the 
solution of the problem in which it appears as the basic 
element. For example, in our Test 5 (a test for geometric 
manipulation), after being told “to form a picture of 
objects described on the test sheet and to count the num- 
ber of continuous straight lines which it would take to 
construct the object in space (and always to count each 
two coinciding lines as one)” the subject reads the follow-
-P-A-G-E-42
30 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
ing description of a solid (among others on the list): “A 
square box with lid attached; lid open.” Immediately he 
mentally manipulates the spatial elements representing 
a square box with a lid attached and open, concentrates 
on it to the exclusion of other elements trying to crowd 
into consciousness, and mentally goes around the box, 
top, sides, base, and lid, counting the lines as he goes till 
he reaches the total (15). Or again, in Test 2 (a test for 
non-geometric manipulation) he is asked to “mentally 
divide sixteen twenty-five by seven,” doing all the work by 
mental manipulation and writing only the answer on the 
paper. 
It should be noted here that the attempt will be made 
to measure mental manipulation, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. To satisfy the criterion of quantitative 
measurement, the quickness or speed with which the men- 
tal manipulation takes place will be determined. For the 
qualitative criterion there is desired a measure of the 
accuracy with which the manipulated elements are cor- 
related with the thing described. Moreover, we shall dis- 
tinguish between three types of mental manipulation: 
first, mental manipulation of geometrical elements, or the 
ability to raise in consciousness and maintain and manipu- 
late there, the spatial elements common to geometry and 
especially to descriptive geometry (including straight 
lines, plane figures, e. g., triangles and squares, and solids 
with plane faces, e. g., the wedge, cube and pyramid) ; 
second, manipulation of quasi-geometrical elements, in 
which the staight line is used in building up images of the 
various letters in a common rectangular alphabet (see 
Test 8); third, the manipulation of non-geometrical ele- 
ments, e. g., mental arithmetic exercises (problems in 
short division), or the formation of mental constructions 
using the letters in the spoken word.

CHAPTER III. 
Tuer SvuBJECTS. 
The data on transfer presented in the following pages 
were secured from 413 students in the University of Ili- 
nois during the interval from September, 1911, to June, 
1914. These subjects may be first broadly classified as 
(1) The Training Group, 326 subjects, students in the 
College of Engineering, who took both the Training 
Course (descriptive geometry) and the two test-series; 
(2) The Control Group, 87 subjects, 15 in the College of 
Engineering and 72 in the School of Education, none of 
whom took the training course, but all of whom took the 
two test-series. 
The training group may be further subdivided into (1) 
the 1913 training group, 217 subjects taking the training 
course and test series in the interval February to June, 
1918, the second semester of the collegiate year, (2) the 
1914 training group, 109 subjects who took both the train- 
ing course and the two test-series in the interval Febru- 
ary to June, 1914. It will be noted that the subjects 
took their training course and both test-series under iden- 
tical groupings of individuals and in the same classroom. 
The control group in turn is subdivided into three sub- 
groups, No. 1 being composed of freshmen engineering 
students, and Nos. 2 and 3 of students in the senior and 
junior classes registered in the School of Education. The 
15 members of control group No. 1 were the only group 
of freshmen engineers taking work in the department of 
General Engineering Drawing who were not taking the 
course in descriptive geometry. 
Thus, the selection of subjects was thoroughly random; 
that is, entire instructor-sections were used. The only 
31
-P-A-G-E-44
32 THD BPXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
basis of selection was “taking descriptive geometry” or 
“not taking descriptive geometry.” 
It should be stated that a total closely approximating 
600 individuals has taken either the first or the second 
test-series. The available number, however, was reduced 
by nearly one-third, owing principally to the fact that 
many individuals were absent from their classes at the 
time either one or the other of the test-series was given. 
Of those who took both test-series, all test-sheets have been 
used which were written in accordance with the require- 
ments for each specific test. Only a negligible fraction 
of the test-sheets was discarded, however, on this account. 
In order to trace the effect of general and specific train- 
ing due to study in courses other than descriptive geom- 
etry, a separate grouping was made of all individuals in 
the entire training group. This grouping, known here- 
after as the training sub-sections, was made on a basis of 
similarity of courses pursued during the training interval 
—that is, all individuals pursuing the same courses were 
placed in the same section. Thus, the training group was 
divided into seven sub-sections, each made up of students 
taking descriptive geometry and a given combination of 
the prescribed and elective courses of the College of En- 
gineering requirements. Ninety-five per cent of the stu- 
dents taking the tests (in the training group) were fresh- 
men in the College of Engineering, and, as the various en- 
gineering curriculums are made up largely of prescribed 
courses, only seven different combinations were required 
to include practically all the subjects. 
The subjects of study listed for each section are as fol- 
lows: 
Group 1 (55 individuals). Group 2 (119 individuals). 
descriptive geometry. descriptive geometry. 
shop practice. shop practice. 
mathematics. mathematics. 
English. sig foreign language.

Group 3 (8 individuals). Groups 4 and 5 (20 individuals). 
descriptive geometry. descriptive geometry. 
shop practice. mathematics. 
mathematics. architecture. 
chemistry or physics. language or Bnglish. 
Group 6 (60 individuals). Group 7 (87 individuals).

mathematics. all upper-class courses (é€. g., 
science, BEnglish or language advanced science). 
(includes all not taking shop those having 2 English courses 
practice). or 2 language courses. 
those having no mathematics. 
It will be noted that the training course, descriptive 
geometry, is the only course common to all of the training 
sub-sections. Of the other courses, mathematics (algebra, 
trigonometry and analytic geometry have been grouped 
together for the preliminary analysis of the cause of pos- 
sible gain on the part of the training group) occurs in 
all groups except No. 7. As will be brought out in detail 
later, this is justified by the fact that 85 per cent of the 
individuals pursuing studies in mathematics are found in 
the course in analytic geometry. Shop practice courses 
(primarily practical work in the forge and machine shop) 
occur in Sections 1, 2, and 3. Groups 4 and 5, which con- 
tain together but 20 individuals, have been combined to 
study the possible effect of training in architecture. 
Groups 1, 2, and 3 are alike in that they contain students 
of descriptive geometry, shop practice and mathematics. 
They differ only in the fourth course included, English in 
Group 1, modern languages in Group 2, and science in 
Group 3. Group 6 contains the students having no shop 
practice, and in Group 7 have been brought together all 
those having no mathematics, all upper classmen and all 
those having two or more courses of a kind. Further dis- 
cussion of our theory of grouping these training sub-sec- 
tions will be found in the chapter on statistical results.

CHAPTER IV. 
Tun Trainine Coursp: Descriptive GEOMETRY. 
Descriptive geometry is a prescribed course of study 
of the freshman or sophomore year in the engineering cur- 
riculums of one hundred and thirty-one higher educational 
institutions of the United States, offering a four-year 
degree-course in engineering. The writer’s study of “The 
Historical Development and Present Status of Techno- 
logical Education in the United States” (1914) shows that 
descriptive geometry has become a standard prerequisite 
for advanced courses in engineering drafting and design. 
Typical practice now offers it as a second semester course 
of the freshman year, and it is found in all engineering 
curriculums, civil, mechanical, electrical, etc. (the Univer- 
sity of Illinois follows this practice), generally accom- 
panying or immediately succeeding a semester’s course in 
the elements of mechanical drafting. 
Its fundamental purpose is to build up for the student 
a method of picturing solid objects (e. g., machines, like 
engines, dynamos, their constituent parts, and the diverse 
materials used in engineering construction of all sorts) 
on one plane, called the plane of projection, and coincident 
with the drawing paper. Just as the component elements 
of solids may be obtained by successive differentiation of 
solids themselves, so we may regard any solid as analys- 
able into its component planes, straight lines, and points. 
Thus, we find that, theoretically, we may regard a straight 
line as a series of points, a plane as a series of straight 
lines and a solid as a series of planes. Since the goal is 
to be able to picture solid objects on one plane, the inter- 
mediate steps must obviously build up a method of pic- 
34  
-P-A-G-E-47
  
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 35 
turing the spatial position of points, lines and planes, 
first separately and then in combination with each other. 
That is exactly what the course does. It is fundamentally 
a developmental course of problems, in which each prob- 
lem provides a method of representing the spatial position 
of some desired combination of points, lines, planes or 
solids on the plane of the drawing paper. Thus, it should 
be emphasized that descriptive geometry is dealing 
throughout with the spatial representation of things, and 
that the correct understanding of the solution of each 
problem in it necessitates a mental construction of the 
things in question. 
Since its introduction into this country (by Col. Claude 
Crozet as a part of the engineering curriculum of the 
United States Military Academy in 1807), descriptive 
geometry has been regarded as having considerable ap- 
plied value for engineers and draftsmen. During the nine- 
teenth century development of engineering curriculums in 
our higher technical schools this point of view became 
so strongly intrenched that nearly all teachers are teaching 
it for its value as an applied science or as a branch of 
applied mathematics. However, the Department of Gen- 
eral Engineering Drawing in the University of Illinois 
regards the course as a branch of pure mathematics. 
This fact is particularly pertinent to our present investi- 
gation. Since the course is regarded, primarly, as a “dis- 
ciplinary” course, each successive problem in the course 
is designed (among other things) to function as a definite 
bit of discipline in spatial picturing. The majority of 
the instructors in the department regard a stage of “vis- 
ualization” as fundamental to the effective presentation 
of each problem. “See the problem in space;” “Picture 
the lines and planes in your problem;” “Image the prob- 
lem”—these are exhortations commonly heard in our 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
classrooms. This constant “drill in visualization,” 
coupled with the use of mechanical devices for further- 
ing it, has led to the belief that four months’ study of de- 
scriptive geometry must fulfill a function in “training the 
imagination.” 
In the training course, the subject-matter of the course 
has been made absolutely uniform for the entire depart- 
ment. Week by week throughout the four months, the 
300-odd students, grouped in 12 teaching sections under 6 
different instructors, are pursuing precisely the same exer- 
cises in the classroom (the solution of blackboard prob- 
lems) and the same practice in the drawing room (solution 
of the same type of problems on drawing paper). The 
only possible variation in the work is in the method of 
presentation, and even here at least four of the six in- 
structors use very similar methods.

Tue Trusts. 
1. Preliminary Tests. 
To secure tests which would adequately measure effi- 
ciently in the mental manipulation of spatial elements, a 
preliminary investigation was conducted during the sum- 
mer of 1911 and the first semester of the following college 
year. Tests were designed, discussed with colleagues and 
advisors, and tried out with some 40 students, princi- 
pally students in the writer’s classes in descriptive geom- 
etry and mechanical drawing. This preliminary experi- 
ment was of the laboratory type. The tests were orally 
presented to individual students in the writer’s office, 
time was taken by a stop watch, and the answers to prob- 
lems were given orally by the subjects and recorded by an 
assistant. From their original form these preliminary 
tests went through a process of change to adapt them to 
the needs of the problem. In the design of these tests two 
considerations were kept in mind: (1) the tests must not 
be so long as to permit within themselves large effects of 
practice, (2) the solution of none of the problems must 
depend on previous training of a specific type, i. e., they 
must be of so “general” a nature that all college freshmen 
will be able to solve them. Owing to the constant chang- 
ing of the tests as given to the different subjects, the re- 
sults of this preliminary investigation are not comparable, 
and are of value to the final investigation only as aids to 
the perfecting of the tests given below. For that reason, 
neither the preliminary tests nor their results will be pre- 
sented here.

2. The Final Tests. 
The tests as taken by the subjects may be grouped as: 
(1) tests for the manipulation of non-geometrical ele- 
ments (Tests 1, 2, and 6), (2) tests for the manipulation 
of quasi-geometrical elements (‘Test 3), (3) tests for the 
manipulation of strictly geometrical elements (Tests 4 
and 5). These tests are reproduced below in the exact 
form, but not in the order in which they were taken by the 
subjects. The order of taking the tests will be explained 
in the chapter on “Securing the Data.” The answers re- 
garded as correct by the judges who scored the tests are 
given in parenthesis after the problems. In addition to 
the tests themselves, we give below a statement of the pur- 
pose of each. This statement does not include the mental 
functions believed to be common to all the tests. These are 
discussed in detail after the exposition of the tests them- 
selves.

Tests 1 and 2 are regarded as giving measures of the 
efficiency of the manipulation of spatial elements of a 
purely non-geometrical type. The solution of the problems 
contained in the tests also involves skill in arithmetical 
fundamentals. There are several reasons that justify 
us in believing that any training in arithmetical funda- 
mentals received during the training interval need not be 
considered as a source of error: (1) the skill is involved 
in both the February and June test series and on the part 
of both the training and control groups; (2) the subjects 
are all adults, having completed at least one semester of 
college work and, being registered in the same depart- 
ment of study, have in the long run undergone approxi- 
mately the same previous training in mental arithmetic; 
(8) the effect of such training, in creating inequalities in 
skill and fundamentals, coming, as the training does, in 
the elementary grades, would have long since been 
smoothed out through the neglect of the function; (4) 
according to the statement of the students, those indi- 
viduals who through practical office work have had spe- 
cial training in mental arithmetic are so few as to have no

material effect on the results. The memory factor was 
practically eliminated by requesting the students to write 
the digits of the answer as rapidly as they pictured them. 
Test 6. The word “Material” test. 
Time given: 300 seconds. 
The subjects were required to picture the letters of the 
word “material” to form from them as many new words 
as possible and to write these in order on a blank slip of 
paper. To maintain the efficiency of the test as a test 
for the mental manipulation of spatial elements, each 
word was hidden from view as soon as written. To indi- 
cate approximately the interval between the obtaining 
of the words, the subjects drew lines under the last word 
written as the successive minutes of elapsed time were 
announced by the investigator. 
In the solution of Test 6 it is possible to bring to bear— 
either separately or in combination—at least five mental 
functions, viz., visual imagery, auditory imagery, sys- 
tematic method (or “system’’), reorganization of the letters 
previously used and ideational or perceptual devices. It 
would naturally be questioned: “How can the mental func- 
tions active in producing the resultant efficiency as shown 
by this test be credited properly for their respective par- 
ticipation in the completed product?” The validity of the 
test will be discussed in detail in Chapter VIII, “Scoring 
the Tests.”

of continuous straight lines (strokes) which would be re- 
quired to print the word using this style of letter.” 
Test 3 is believed to be a measure of ability in the men- 
tal manipulation of quasi-geometrical elements (plane 
figures—no three dimensional objects). Memory plays 
very little part (it is believed to be negligible) in the solu- 
tion of the test problems, as they are made up of very 
short words.

Tests 4 and 5 are regarded as measures of ability in 
mental manipulation of strictly geometrical elements. A 
three-dimensional object was used in Test 4, and both 
two and three-dimensional figures in Test 5. The diversity 
of the tests and the short time given for the solution of 
each one are believed to prevent effectually the building 
up of a definite method of solution through reasoning 
processes (organization, etc.). In other words, it is be- 
lieved that a solution of each of these tests is confined to 
(1) a mental picturing of the object, (2) the counting of 
the various lines and surfaces, (8) the writing of the 
various answers.
-P-A-G-E-55
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 43 
There are certain functions which are common to the 
solution of most, if not all, of the tests. These functions 
are present, of course, in the solution of both the first and 
second test-series, and are all functions to which ele- 
mentary and secondary school education has contributed 
training to such an extent that our training course is re- 
garded as having no further effect. In other words, the 
efficiency of these functions is considered as equivalent 
in both the February and June test series. 
Those functions active in all tests are (1) accwracy in 
recording the solutions to problems (e. g., writing the an- 
swers to short division problems, writing the number of 
straight lines in certain straight-line letters or the number 
of lines in certain geometrical shapes), in brief, the ability 
to set down accuractly the result which has been derived ; 
(2) quickness in recording results to problems. Both 
accuracy and quickness are present in the two series, and 
the work performed is so slight in extent, and the interval 
between the taking of the two test-series is so great, that 
the functions are regarded as negligible in discussing the 
validity of our tests as measures of improvement in mental 
manipulation. 
Mental functions involved specifically in the solutions 
of Tests 3, 4, and 5 include accuracy in counting lines or 
plane surfaces and quickness in counting lines and plane 
surfaces. 
In addition to the above functions, careful attention 
was given to the activity of a common factor affecting 
both test series—the attitude of the subjects. The in- 
vestigator and his assistants used great care in determin- 
ing the status of this factor in each section in which tests 
were given. The attitude of the 413 subjects whose re-

sults have been used in this investigation may be denoted 
as one of serious-minded interest in solving each test to 
the best of their ability. The results of three subjects 
whose attitude seemed careless or antagonistic were dis- 
carded.

CHAPTER VI. 
SEcuRING THE Data. 
The data of this investigation were secured at the be- 
ginning and close of the second semester of the-two col- 
lege years, 1912-13 and 1913-14. The 1913 training group 
took its first test-series between February 2 and 6 and its 
second between May 25 and 27. The 1914 training group 
took its first series February 12 to 14 and its second be- 
tween May 27 and 30. The control group No. 1 took its 
first series February 13 and its second June 2; control 
groups 2 and 8 took the first series February 17 and its 
second May 28. Thus, the training was for all prac- 
tical purposes identical for all groups, averaging about 
15 weeks. In the case of each training group the first 
test-series was taken during the first week of study in 
descriptive geometry and before any of the training in 
mental picturing was begun. The amount of training 
given each section of the two training groups was there- 
fore identical. 
The tests were taken by the sections in their customary 
classroom and at their regular weekly and daily time of 
meeting. In each case the instructor in charge of the 
section prepared the way for the taking of the tests by 
brief introductory remarks. Following these the writer 
conducted the taking of the tests by the section. All 
tests, both February and June, 1913 and 1914, were thus 
conducted by the one investigator, so as to secure as 
nearly perfect uniformity as possible. The steps involved 
in the conduct of the tests included certain general and 
certain specific instructions.

-P-A-G-E-58
46 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
(a) General Instructions. 
There was given the following brief explanation of the 
nature and purpose of the tests. Special care was taken 
to secure the undivided attention and interest of every 
individual member of the class: 
“You men may know that in many of our larger universi- 
sities throughout the country, like Chicago, Wisconsin and 
Solumbia, there are being carried on investigations of an 
educational nature. By performing experiments in their 
classes, teachers are trying to find out what they can 
about the abilities of students, not only in the colleges, 
but in the high schools and elementary schools as well. 
To do so they are asking pupils in their classes to solve 
simple test-problems which have been devised for that 
purpose. 
“Now, we are carrying on such an investigation in this 
department of the University of Illinois, and would like 
to ask you to help us in it, as Mr. ———— (instructor of 
the section) has kindly permitted us to use about half an 
hour of your time this morning, instead of spending it on 
descriptive geometry. You will understand, of course, 
that this help will be entirely voluntary on your part, and 
that your interest in, and careful attention to, the tests 
will be a very great favor to us. Of course, these tests 
have nothing to do with your standing in descriptive 
geometry, and I may say that nobody in the department 
except myself will see your results. So please give your 
very best effort to the solving of the problems in each test. 
Remember we are trying to determine two things in each 
of the tests—your accuracy and your quickness. As you 
take up each test, work as many problems as you can and 
work each as accurately as you can. Each of the tests 
is a time test. Before we take up each test I will make a
-P-A-G-E-59
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 47 
careful explanation of its nature and its purpose, telling 
you exactly what to do, also telling you how much time 
you are to be given. Then we will hand you the test paper 
and ask you to keep it printed side down and to write 
your name on the back at once At the signal “go,” please 
turn the paper, read the directions and the statement of 
the problems and work as many of them as you can and 
each as accurately as you can. At the signal “stop,” 
please stop instantly and do not write anything on the 
paper thereafter. If you complete the entire test before 
hearing the signal “stop,” please hold up your hand in- 
stantly, and I will name the time (in seconds) which you 
have taken. Please write this time on your paper. As 
soon as time is up, please pass the papers down to the 
right, and we will proceed to the next test. We will now 
take up the first test.” 
This general explanation was given to each section that 
took the tests in the two years, with a very slight change 
in the references to descriptive geometry in the case of the 
control groups. Care was taken with all sections to give 
the same emphasis to the main points of the explanation. 
It is believed, from consultation with the instructors in 
charge of the sections, that this was done satisfactorily. 
Following these general directions the tests were at once 
taken up in order, and certain specific directions given 
for them in all the sections. These directions for the va- 
rious tests are reproduced below in the order in which the 
tests were taken by the students. For the tests themselves 
consult Chapter V. 
(bv) Specific Instructions for the Several Tests. 
First test (straight-line alphabet test, No. 3). While 
the test papers were being handed out the straight-line 
alphabet (reproduced in Chapter V) was put on the black-
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
board, with this explanation: “Please note carefully the 
formation of the letters in this alphabet. Notice that they 
are all capitals, that there are no curved lines, and that 
each letter has been made with as few straight lines as 
possible. Are they understood?” The alphabet was then 
erased. “In this test you will find on the test sheet a list of 
short words. We want you to form in your mind a picture 
of each word, beginning at the left of the sheet. Count the 
number of lines which it would take to print each of these 
words if you used the alphabet which you have just seen 
on the board. Be sure to use no other letters than those 
used in the style just shown you. Write the total num- 
ber of lines which you obtain for each word below the 
word. Do not write or print the words themselves. If 
you finish before the signal “stop,” be sure to hold up your 
hand instantly and write the time that I give you on the 
back of your paper. Do not write anything after the 
signal “stop.” Is your name on the back of your paper? 
Ready? Go!” 
At the completion of the test each section was asked 
to print on the back of the sheet the style of alphabet that 
had been used in the problem. Thus, the accuracy of each 
subject was checked in the scoring of the tests. 
Second test (short-division test, three operations, No. 1). 
“In this test you will find on the paper a list of ten ex- 
amples in short division. At the signal we wish you to 
solve these in your head, but write nothing on the paper 
but the answer. You may write the answer as a whole 
number and a fraction, thus [illustration on the black- 
board]. Instead of retaining the different digits in the 
answer until you have them all, please write them on the 
paper as fast as you get them, thus [illustration with 
problem on the board]. Work as many problems as you 
can, and work each as accurately as you can. Do not  
-P-A-G-E-61
  
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 49 
write anything on the paper after you hear the signal 
“stop.” Is your name on the paper? You will be given 60 
seconds in this test. Ready? Go!” 
In Tests 1 and 2 the 1918 training group was required 
to turn the paper after reading each problem and to write 
the answer on the back. The 1914 training group and the 
control group were both allowed to write the answer on 
the front of the paper. 
Third test (geometrical objects test, No. 5). “On the 
other side of this paper you will find a list of names of 
objects, some of which are plane figures and other three- 
dimensional objects. In this test we want you to form in 
your mind (beginning at the top of the paper with the first 
object) a picture of each object, and to count the number 
of straight lines which would be necessary to construct 
that object if it were standing alone in space. Remember 
to count all the lines in the object, not simply those which 
you can see from one or two sides as in a perspective draw- 
ing. Count the base-lines, the vertical lines, the inclined 
lines, if there are any, and the top lines. If, in any object, 
two lines coincide, please count those two lines as one. 
For instance, suppose I had a large rectangular block of 
wood on this table, so that the edges of the block exactly 
coincided with those of the table top. Then I would count 
these two edges as one, these two as one, etc., all around 
the table. Is that point understood? Write the answer 
in the place provided after each problem. Do not write 
any part of an answer after the signal “stop.” Your time 
in this test will be 90 seconds. Is your name on the back 
of the paper? Ready? Go!” 
At the conclusion of the test the class was requested to 
turn the papers over and to make a small sketch on the 
back to show the number of lines counted for each object 
worked. This served as an admirable check on the accu- 
racy of the scoring of the papers.
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
Fourth test (second short-division test, four operations, 
No. 2). “This test is another exercise in short division, 
similar to the one you just had. The directions are pre- 
cisely the same as in that test: begin at the top of the 
paper, work as many problems as you can, as accurately 
as you can, and write only the answer on the paper. Write 
the answer as a whole number and a fraction, as before, 
and write the digits in the answer as rapidly as you get 
them. Since these problems are a little longer than the 
others, we will give you 90 seconds on this test. Do not 
write a digit after you hear the signal “stop.” Is your 
name on the paper? Ready? Go!” 
Fifth test (painted cube test, No. 4). “There is no ex- 
planation in this test other than you will find on the paper. 
Read very carefully the directions given there. If you 
finish before time is up, hold up your hand instantly and 
write on your paper the time that I give you. You will be 
given 80 seconds on this test. Is your name on the back 
of the paper? Ready? Go!” 
Sieth test (the word “Material” test, No. 6). Blank 
sheets of paper were handed to the class, followed by this 
direction: “In this test I am going to pronounce and 
spell carefully a word. I want you to notice very carefully 
exactly what letters are used in this word, and the way in 
which they may be repeated. As soon as you get the word, 
please form as many new words as you can from the let- 
ters of the given one and write the words as rapidly as you 
form them on the sheet. In any one of your words use 
oaly the letters of the given word, and repeat in any one 
word only those letters which may be repeated in the given 
word. As rapidly as you write the words, please hide 
them from view, thus [illustrate]: do not under any cir- 
cumstances refer back to your list. If you have forgotten 
whether you have written a certain word, write it again
-P-A-G-E-63
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 51 
rather than look back. Hide words by drawing the paper 
over the arm of your chair. You will be given five minutes 
on this test, and I will tell you the time by minutes. As 
I name the successive minutes, please draw a line across 
the paper under the last word which you have written, and 
go on to the next word. I shall say at the end of each 
minute, “Draw a line, first minute, second minute, ete. 
Is your name on the paper? Ready for the word? This 
word is M-A-T-E-R-I-A-L, Material.” 
At frequent intervals the investigator mentioned to the 
class that they must hide the words from view. On the 
whole, this direction was followed. 
(c) Miscellaneous Points. 
From the preliminary investigation the tests had been 
timed so that the average student would finish about half 
of the work given on each test sheet at the time of taking 
the first test-series. The time given proved to be adjusted 
in this proportion for practically all sections, and few 
subjects finished before the signal “stop” was given. It 
was arranged that those who did finish should write the 
elapsed time on their papers, and thus there was given a 
further check on their speed. In the case of the fourth 
and sixth tests, those individuals who were familiar with 
the problems given stated this on their papers. Their 
scores were not included in the tabulation of results. 
In order to keep any knowledge of the investigation 
from the students in other sections of the department, the 
members of each section were asked not to discuss the 
tests in any way. Those in succeeding sections were asked 
if they heard anything of the tests. The replies indicated 
that our request had been complied with by the subjects 
who had already taken the tests, and that each section 
came to the tests with the same attitude toward them.
-P-A-G-E-64
52 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
At the end of the June test series introspections were 
obtained from practically all sections on the working of 
each of the tests. Since these subjects were entirely un- 
trained in introspective analysis, these were regarded as 
rough aids only in the interpretation of our tabulated 
scores. The method of securing valid introspections on 
the mental processes involved in the solution of the va- 
rious test problems is explained at length in Chapter X, 
“The Theory of Transfer.”
-P-A-G-E-65
  CHAPTER VII. 
Scoring tue Tusts. 
All the papers were scored by the writer. Tests 1 to 
5, inclusive, of the 1913 training group were scored in 
October, 1913, the remaining tests in the summer of 1914. 
All who took both test-series were first numbered accord- 
ing to the system used in the Department of General En- 
gineering Drawing, University of Illinois; the 1913 train- 
ing group formed Nos. 1 to 316, the 1914 training group 
Nos. 400 to 499 and 600 to 609, the control group Nos. 
501 to 588. These numbers were used on all papers, and 
the subjects were known thereafter by number. 
The method of scoring each test is given in detail below: 
Tests 1 and 2 (short-division tests). Speed was scored 
as the total number of digits recorded in the answers to 
all problems worked in the test ; accuracy as the total num- 
ber of these digits found to be correct. Thus, a score of 
27/19 given in a paper was later tabulated as 27 (mental 
operations) attempted and 19 worked correctly. Effi- 
ciency is expressed as the per cent of total operations cor- 
rectly worked. These problems were orginally scored by 
merely stating the number of problems worked and the 
number right. It was perceived that this method was 
subject to large inaccuracies and the method was further 
refined, so that the score of the test should indicate as 
closely as possible the true status of the accompanying 
mental process. : 
Test 3 (straight-line alphabet). Speed was scored as 
the number of words attempted, accuracy as the number 
of words for which the correct number of lines was stated. 
A positive check was secured by having the student print 
on the back of the test sheet the exact letters that he used. 
Test 4 (painted-cube test). Speed was scored as the 
number of problems attempted, accuracy as the number 
of problems for which the correct number of painted faces 
53
-P-A-G-E-66
  54 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
was stated. It is recognized that the measure of efficiency 
of correlated mental processes is here very much less re- 
fined than in the other tests. There was no way found, 
however, by which greater refinement could be obtained. 
Test 5 (geometrical-objects test). Speed was scored as 
the number of problems attempted, accuracy as the num- 
ber of problems for which the correct number of lines was 
stated. As in Test 3, a positive check was secured by hav- 
ing each subject make a drawing of the objects worked. 
Test 6 (the word material test). The number of 
words obtained in each of the successive minutes of the 
test, and the total number of words obtained were re- 
corded on each paper. All repetitions of words in a given 
paper and all words using letters not in the given word 
were disregarded. 
The method of scoring to determine the specific psy- 
chological processes, or functions, involved in the solution 
of Test 6 was first standardized by consultation of four 
adult judges, all of whom had had psychological training. 
Sample papers were given to these judges, with the request 
that they work through the list of words and analyze them 
carefully to determine the psychological functions which 
might have contributed to the obtaining of the lists. Fol- 
lowing this, joint consultation of the judges was held to 
discuss the results and criticize each other’s methods. 
Five possible mental functions were agreed upon which 
may have contributed to the obtaining of the words on the 
list. These were visual imagery, auditory imagery (or 
kinesthetic imagery), reorganization of letters previously 
used, systematic method (e. g., that of consciously search- 
ing for words beginning with the same letter), and idea- 
tional or perceptual processes. A composite method of 
scoring the mental process behind the formation of each 
two consecutive words was then made up arbitrarily by 
the writer and applied to the papers of all subjects. To
-P-A-G-E-67
  or MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES . 
illustrate the working of this method a sample list of 
words and its scoring is given below. In this list “x” indi- 
cates the specific mental function or functions believed to 
be active in the formation of successive words. 
Key: A = auditory imagery; O = reorganization of 
letters; S = system or systematic method; V = visual 
imagery; I = ideational processes.

56 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF — 
Naturally this method gives no absolutely precise meas- 
ure of the extent to which the various mental functions 
have been operative, but judging from the outcome of its 
application to more than 16,000 words, a close approxima- 
tion to the participation of the various functions was 
secured. It seems assured, at least, that Test 6 is largely 
a test for visual manipulation, as the scoring indicates 
that over 80 per cent of the words were probably con- 
tributed by this function. Again, that systematic method 
and ideational processes do not play a large role is clear 
from our later tabulations (see Tables D and E).

CHAPTER VIII. 
TABULATION OF THE Data, 
The procedure followed in tabulating our data may be 
outlined as follows: 
1. The Original Record Sheets. 
The transferring of the results of individual papers to 
original record sheets was the first step in the work of 
tabulation. For Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, these sheets were 
organized in the manner illustrated herewith. One record 
sheet was used for each section. The sample given shows 
a sample entry for one subject in one test.

(Sub. Trg. Sec. means sub-training section of the training group; 
Grd. = grade in descriptive geometry; G. = gain; EH. = even record 
(constant); L. = loss; T. means time.) 
For Test 6 there was recorded for both the February and 
the June test series (1) the number of words formed in 
each minute, (2) the total number of words, (3) total 
gain, (4) the per cent gain, (5) the number of words 
formed by each of the five mental processes, A, O, 8, V, 
and I. 
57
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
These original record sheets thus give for each subject 
in the investigation (1) the absolute quantity attempted 
and the amount performed correctly in both test-series, 
(2) the gain of each subject, both in absolute numbers 
and in per cent, (3) the efficiency attained in both test- 
series. Since the data of these original records are all 
embodied in summary form in Tables A-1, A-2, and A-3, 
we have not reproduced here the 110 original tables for 
Tests 1 to 5, inclusive. No data of any importance to a 
thorough understanding of the study have been omitted. 
2. Tables for the Comparison of Absolute Attainment of 
Individuals and Groups. 
Tables A-1, A-2, and A-3 give the efficiency of each sub- 
ject in Tests 1 to 6, inclusive. 
Tables B-1 to B-20, contingency tables for Tests 1 to 5, 
give the number of subjects making certain number of 
attempts and getting a certain number of these attempts 
correct. These give also (for training and control groups 
separately) the median number of problems attempted 
and the median number right. These tables offer a second 
method of comparing the work done by the two groups and 
thus of determining possible resultant progress in imagery 
due to the training course. 
Table C gives for Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, a summary of 
the number of problems (or operations) worked and the 
median gains made by training and control groups. 
Table D gives for Test 6 the aggregate and average 
number of words obtained in both test-series and for both 
groups. 
Table E gives the aggregate and average number of 
words obtained by each of the five mental functions in- 
volved and the corresponding per cent gain in various 
groups. 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 59 
3. Tables for the Determination of Relative Gains Made 
by Training and Control Groups. 
Tables F-1, F-2, and F-3 give for Tests 1 to 6, inclusive, 
the per cent gain made by each subject. 
Table G gives for Tests 1 to 6, inclusive, the number and 
per cent of subjects who gained in both “Attempts” and 
“Rights.” 
Table H gives a summary of the aggregate and average 
gains in Tests 1 to 5, inclusive. 
Table I gives the number of subjects who gained in 
various propositions of all tests taken in mental manipu- 
lation. 
4. Tables to Aid in Tracing the Cause of Greater Gain 
on the Part of the Training Group. 
Table J gives for Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, a summary of 
the efficiencies and per cent gains of the subjects as 
grouped in the seven training sub-sections.
-P-A-G-E-72
  CHAPTER IX. 
STarIsTICAL RESULTS OF THE TABULATION. 
From the foregoing, it will be seen, there are five stages 
in our statistical attack upon the problem before us, viz., 
(1) the transference of the test-sheet scores to our original 
record sheets, (2) the determination of the absolute quan- 
tities of work done by our training and control groups, 
i. e., of the absolute efficiencies in the mental functions 
under observation, (3) the determination of the relative 
gains made by the training group as compared with that 
of the control group, (4) the isolation of the cause of a 
residual gain in favor of either group, (5) the correlation 
of efficiency in the mental functions involved in these tests. 
A study of the quantitative aspects of these problems 
should lead to the answer to such questions as: What 
is the initial and final attainment of various individuals? 
What is the relative efficiency of the various groups? 
What is the relation of speed to accuracy in resultant 
efficiency of the various tests? What is the typical gain 
of the individuals? of the groups? Which group gains 
the more? In what proportion of all the tests taken do 
the various subjects gain? If there is a gain in certain 
tests, is that of the training group greater or smaller than 
that of the control group? Can our statistics aid in iso- 
lating the cause of the residual gain? 
1. The Efficiency of Individuals and Groups. 
Those interested in the study of the detailed records of 
this investigation will find in Tables A-1, A-2, A-3 the per 
cent efficiency attained by each of the subjects in both 
60
-P-A-G-E-73
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 61 
February and June test-series in Tests 1 to 6, inclusive. 
The figures given there represent the per cent of the total 
oprations or problems solved correctly by each subject. 
Thus, in Test 1, of a total of 30 operations, an efficiency 
of 90 per cent corresponds to 27 digits right. In Test 6, 
however, the figures given represent the number of words 
formed. 
It must be recognized that the evidence of efficiency is 
twofold: speed and accuracy must both be considered. 
In other words, how many problems did each subject at- 
tempt, and how many did he solve correctly? The latter 
aspect corresponds to “efficiency” as expressed in our 
tables. 
More accurately to picture the status of efficiency among 
the subjects, both individually and by groups, 20 “con- 
tingency” tables are presented herewith, Tables B-1 to 
B-20. (The writer is adapting Professor Karl Pearson’s 
term “contingency” to his use in this immediate problem.) 
The design of a contingency table of this type has revealed 
a method of mathematically and pictorially representing 
absolute attainment in both “Attempts” and “Rights” for 
each of the tests. Analytic and comparative study of 
these tables will give a definite idea of the efficiency of 
the training and control groups. 
To complete the “type picture” of the progress of the 
two groups we provide summary-table C, which gives the 
median number of problems (or parts of problems) at- 
tempted and right, with the accompanying gains. We are 
now in a position to discuss the amount of work done by 
both training and control groups in Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, 
recalling here the grouping of these tests: 1 and 2 non- 
geometrical, 3 quasi-geometrical, 4 and 5 strictly geometri- 
eal. A glance over the February efficiencies reveals the 
fact that the training group maintains a slightly higher
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
initial efficiency than the control group in the non-geo- 
metrical tests and in the quasi-geometrical test, and that 
the initial efficiency of the training group in the strictly 
geometrical tests considerably exceeds that of the control 
group. That is, we find that the initial efficiency of the 
training group is markedly larger in all of the tests. (The 
training group is made up of engineering freshmen, 
whereas the members of the control group are principally 
juniors and seniors in general arts courses.) 
But what proves to be the status of efficiency in the two 
groups at the second test taking? Examination of the 
June efficiencies shows that the efficiency of the training 
group exceeds that of the control group in the non-geo- 
metrical tests, the quasi-geometrical test and in the 
strictly geometrical tests. The gain in “Rights” is re- 
garded, throughout this investigation, as the most valid 
measure of the relative progress in these tests. It is found 
that in “Rights” the gain for the training group (taken 
as a whole) is larger than the gain of the control group 
in all tests. The residual gain in favor of the training 
group is for each of the five tests, respectively,—0.9 per 
cent, 15.78 per cent, 20.4 per cent, 14.0 per cent, 48.5 per 
cent. Again, if we consider the number of problems at- 
tempted as a partial check on the relative efficiencies of 
the two groups, the training group proves to be superior 
in all tests but Test 4. Here the residual gain is for the 
five tests, 1.4, 5.5, 6.4,—8.2 and 15 per cent, respectively. 
In the case of Test 4 (the painted-cube test) a large num- 
ber of subjects finished the test before time was called. 
Their elapsed time was recorded on the original record 
sheets. No provision has been made on the contingency 
tables for time factor; otherwise, Test 4 would reveal 
a residual gain for the training group as in the other 
four tests.
-P-A-G-E-75
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 63 
For the purpose of roughly indicating the tendencies 
in the three types of mental manipulation, the efficiency 
obtained by each group in Tests 1 and 2, and in Tests 4 
and 5 will be averaged. An interesting progression re- 
sults. The residual gain for the training group over that 
of the control group is now, for the non-geometrical tests, 
7.44 per cent; for the quasi-geometrical test, 20.4 per cent, 
and for the strictly geometrical tests, 31.25 per cent. The 
same progressively increasing gain in favor of the training 
group exists in the results for “Attempts;” 3.47 per cent 
for the non-geometrical tests, 6.4 per cent for the quasi- 
geometrical test, and 11.6 per cent for the strictly geo- 
metrical tests. 
The results for Test 6, another test with non-geometrical 
elements, give additional data on this question. Turn to 
Table D. In the February test the training group ob- 
tained an average of 19.1 words, the control group 21.3 
words; in the June tests the figures are 23.90 and 23.80, 
respectively. Thus, the relative gain of the training group 
is 24.87 per cent, and of the control group 11.5 per cent. 
This is of interest, as it leaves a residual gain for the 
training group of 13.37 per cent. The solution of Test 6, 
however, involves five possible functions, and the general 
results are complicated by the possible contributions of 
reasoning functions, like organization, systematic method 
or ideational or perceptual processes. Table E gives the 
specific data that are needed at this point; that is, the 
number of words formed by each of the five psychological 
methods. Using now the data for words formed by visual 
manipulation alone, we find that the training group gains 
22.8 per cent of its initial efficiency, and the control group 
15.4 per cent—a residual gain for the training group of 
7.4 per cent. Test 6, then, at least to a small extent, re- 
inforces the results obtained from Tests 1 and 2, namely,  
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
that the training group shows a progressively greater gain 
over the control group as one proceeds from the non-geo- 
metrical field of mental manipulation to the strictly geo- 
metrical field. 
2. Determination of Relative Gains Made by Training and 
Control Groups. 
Thus far there has been considered in the tabulations 
the entire number of subjects in the two groups. It has 
been found that there is a difference in the amount of work 
done by the two groups in their initial performances; that 
this difference is constantly in favor of the training group, 
(most pertinent to the problems of this investigation) 
that, regardless of the greater initial efficiency of the 
training group, the gain of the training group is greater 
in every test than is that of the control group. So much 
have the tables of initial and final efficiency contributed. 
We now take up another phase of the problem: the 
status of the gainers. New questions have now to be an- 
swered: (a) How many individuals gain in each group in 
each test? (b) How large is their gain in each test and 
in each of the types of mental manipulation? What is the 
average gain of each group in each test? (c) In how 
many tests do the gainers gain? Are they consistent gain- 
ers, gaining in all types of tests? What is the typical 
progress of the training group compared with that of the 
control group? 
(a) How Many Individuals Gain in Each Test? 
Since the two groups do not contain the same number 
of individuals, the absolute number of gainers is not of 
interest. In Table G, however, comparable data are found
-P-A-G-E-77
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 65 
for the two groups, viz., the per cent of each group gaining 
in each test. 
“Attempts.” From the figures of the status in “At- 
tempts” of all training subjects there is found a remark- 
ably constant percentage of gain; this is, for each of the 
five tests in order, 69.2, 64.2, 64.6, 63.7, and 66.0 per cent. 
Here the extreme variation is only 5.5 per cent. The “At- 
tempts” recorded of the contro] group reveals the same 
small variation, but a constantly smaller percentage of 
gainers than in the training group. The figures for the 
five tests, respectively, are: 47.6, 45.3, 63.6, 43.7, and 45.8 
per cent.* On the whole, then, we have two consistent 
groups: approximately 45 per cent of the control group 
gain in Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, and approximately 65 per 
cent of the training group gain in the same tests. Turn- 
ing our figures of superiority of the training group into 
per cent of the number of gainers in the control group, we 
find that our training group had 44 per cent more gainers, 
or nearly half again as large a proportion of gainers as 
did the control group. 
“Rights.” As a more adequate test of efficiency, the evi- 
dence is here still more conclusively on the side of the 
training group. The per cent of gainers in this group for 
each of Tests 1 to 5, inclusive, is 70.0, 67.8, 57.6, 55.3, and 
62.5 per cent; for the control group, 47.6, 39.5, 44.2, 37.8, 
and 35.3 per cent, respectively. Thus, in the case of 
“Rights,” there is a distinct difference in ability to gain 
in the various types of mental manipulation. A wider 
variation is found in both groups, 18.7 per cent in the 
training group and 12.3 per cent in the control group. 
But pertinent to this inquiry and reinforcing the evidence 
~*In spite of detailed study of the larger gain in “Attempts” in 
Test 3, the author can offer no complete explanation for it. It 
seems to be due to a larger gain throughout the group and not to 
abnormal gains of any one of the control sub-groups.
-P-A-G-E-78
  66 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
as noted above, we have more than half again as many 
gainers in the training group as in the control group; the 
average of the transposed per cents is 56.2 per cent. Espe- 
cially significant to the solution of the problem is the fact 
that both in non-geometrical tests (1 and 2) and in the 
strictly geometrical tests (4 and 5) there are nearly two- 
thirds again as large a proportion of gainers in the train- 
ing group as in the control group. 
(b) How Large is the Gain of Individuals and Groups? 
If familiarity with the tests and practice-effect increase 
attainment in this investigation, it might well result in a 
large proportion of the control group showing a gain in 
the June test series. It actually did result in from 35 to 
47 per cent of the group gaining in attainment. Thus, 
to demonstrate an effect of training in descriptive geom- 
etry we must do more than discover how many individuals 
gained. We must next examine carefully the amount of 
gain made by the gainers of each group. Turn to Table 
J-1 for a survey of the aggregate and average gains in 
“Attempts” and “Rights.” The figures represent for 1913 
and 1914 training and control groups the total and aver- 
age number of problems (or parts of problems, as in Tests 
1 and 2) gained in Tests 1 to 5, respectively. The data 
for the number of operations or problems gained in “At- 
tempts” are as follows: 
Test1. Test2. Test3. Test4. Test 5. 
Training Group......... 5.85 5.32 2.077 1.445 2.0 
Control Group......... 5.56 4.34 1.705 1.582 1.615 
Gai edseag hea ease 0.29 0.98 0.372 —0.137 0.385 
This shows a residual gain in favor of the training 
group in each test except No. 4. In Test 1 the training
-P-A-G-E-79
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 67 
group gained 5.7 per cent more than the control group; 
in Test 2, 22.6 per cent more; in Test 3, 21.8 per cent more, 
and in Test 5, 24.2 per cent more. In Test 4 the figures 
given indicate that the control group gained 10 per cent 
more than the training group. We recall that here, as 
above in the discussion of efficiency in the entire groups, 
these figures do not take account of the individuals who 
solved all four problems of this test in less than allowed 
time. Of these there were only 22 out of 87 in the control 
group, 24.9 per cent; in the training group there were 
133 out of 297, 44.8 per cent. No device for accurately 
measuring the amount of gain due to lower time has been 
worked out for this test. We do know, however, that, 
considering these figures, the gain of the training group 
considerably exceeds that of the control group. 
The data for the average number of operations of prob- 
lems gained in “Rights” are as follows: 
Test1. Test2. Test3. Test4. Test 5. 
Training Group........ 5.52 4.71 2.47 1.64 2.19 
Control Group........ 5.96 3.71 2.03 1.52 1.50 
AMG a teasers 9 —0.44 1.00 0.44 0.12 0.69 
With the exception of Test 1, the residual gains are 
again in favor of the training group. In Test 2 the train- 
ing group gained 21.2 per cent more than the control 
group; in Test 3, 22 per cent more; in Test 4, 7.9 per cent 
more, and in Test 5, 46 per cent more. 
Let us recall the data from Test 6 as found in Table D, 
in order to check our evidence on the gain in ability in 
non-geometrical manipulation. The number of words ob- 
tained by visual imagery alone gave a residual gain in 
favor of the training group of 7.4 per cent. It was also 
found that the total training group, as compared with the 
total control group, showed an increasingly greater supe-
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
riority as one proceeded from the non-geometrical to the 
strictly geometrical fields of mental maniputation. The 
figures were, for these three types of tests, roughly 7, 20, 
and 31 per cent. 
In general, therefore, the data of the present inquiry 
into the amount of gain, agree with the previous results, 
in that the training group shows a considerably larger 
residual gain over the control group with strictly geo- 
metrical material than with non-geometrical material. 
(c) In How Many Tests Do the Gainers Gain? 
There still remains one method of attacking the prob- 
lems of “gain” on the part of the various groups. Having 
determined the number of gainers and the proportion of 
all individuals gaining, and the relative amounts of the 
gains, we should now establish the frequency of occurrence 
of these gains. Do the same individuals gain in all of 
the tests? What is the typical number of tests in which 
members of the two groups gain? 
In Table I is found a statement of the number of indi- 
viduals who gained in various proportions of all tests 
taken. These totals are so arranged in the table that the 
columns from left to right progressively represent a con- 
stantly decreasing efficiency. For example, the totals for 
the training group read: 24 subjects worked 5 tests and 
gained in 5; 7 worked 4 and gained in 4; 4 worked 3 and 
gained in 8, etc.; 68 worked 5 and gained in 4; 19 worked 
4 and gained in 3; 1 worked 8 and gained in 2; 98 worked 
5 and gained in 3, etc. In addition to these detailed data, 
the summaries of the tables give the number gaining in 
60 per cent or more of the tests taken, the number gaining 
in 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the tests taken and the 
number gaining in none of the tests taken. Further, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 69 
typify the efficiency of the entire groups, we can state 
the average number of tests in which gains were made in 
“Attempts” and in “Rights.” 
Examining the columns of the table we find that for 
the training group the balance of the table is thrown 
heavily to the left or more efficient end. For the control 
group, however, the “center of efficiency” moves distinctly 
to the right of the middle, toward the less efficient end. 
Thus, even if we did not have at our command specific 
averages of gain made, we should be convinced of the 
greater constancy of gain on the part of the training group 
by the pictorial arrangement. To be more precise, how- 
ever, how far does this greater constancy extend? In 
“Attempts” 67.8 per cent of the training group gained in 
60 per cent or more of all tests taken; 42.5 per cent of 
the control group gained in 60 per cent of all tests taken— 
a further proof of the superiority of the training group in 
the amount gained. And, just as has been the case with 
other phases of the tabulations, this superiority is even 
more marked in “Rights” than in “Attempts.” Seventy- 
two and seven-tenths per cent of the training group gained 
in 60 per cent or more of the tests taken, while 31.0 per cent 
of the control group gained in 60 per cent or more of the 
teststaken. But, going still further into the problem, what 
is the “psychological center of efficiency” for the table? 
What is the average number of tests in which gain is 
made by each of the groups? In “Attempts”: for the 
387.7 training group 35 
ae , or 49 per cent. In “Rights”: for the training 
group Be, or 64.5 per cent; for the contro] group 24.0 
60’ , or 63 per cent; for the control group 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
or 40 per cent. Thus, from all angles from which we may 
view the progress of the various groups it is found that 
the training group gains in a distinctly larger proportion 
of the tests than does the control group. 
(d) Summary. 
What, then, are the essential features of the perspective 
which has been drawn of the efficiency and progress of 
the subjects in the February and June test-series? 
(1) Efficiency of the entire groups. (a) In initial at- 
tainment the training group slightly excels the control 
group in the mental manipulation of non-geometrical and 
quasi-geometrical elements and greatly excels the control 
group in the case of strictly geometrical elements. That 
is, the initial attainment of the training group is always 
superior to that of the control group. (b) Regardless of 
the status of initial attainment, the median gain in attain- 
ment of the entire training group exceeds that of the entire 
control group. The residual gains in favor of the train- 
ing group are progressively greater as one proceeds from 
the non-geometrical field (7 per cent in Tests 1, 2, and 6), 
to the quasi-geometrical field (20 per cent in Test 3), and 
to the strictly geometrical field (31 per cent in Tests 
4 and 5). 
(2) Increase in individual efficiency. (a) How many 
individuals gain? In “Attempts,” in all of the tests ap- 
proximately half again as large a proportion of the train- 
ing group gain as of the control group. In “Rights,” con- 
siderably over half again as large a proportion of the train- 
ing group gain as of the control group. (b) How much do 
they gain? In both “Attempts” and “Rights” the training 
group gains approximately 20 per cent more than the 
control group and makes a progressively increasing gain 
over the control group as one proceeds from the tests with
-P-A-G-E-83
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES Ts 
non-geometrical elements to those with quasi- and strictly 
geometrical elements. (c) In how many tests do the 
gainers gain? In “Attempts” 67.8 per cent of the training 
group and 42.5 per cent of the control group gain in 60 
per cent or more of the tests taken. In “Rights” 72.7 per 
cent of the training group and 31 per cent of the control 
group gain in 60 per cent or more of the tests taken. The 
average per cent of tests in which the two groups gain is, 
for the training group, “Attempts” 63 per cent, “Rights” 
64.5 per cent; for the control group, “Attempts” 49 per 
cent, “Rights” 40 per cent. In general, the training group 
gains in a distinctly larger proportion of tests taken than 
does the control group. 
38. The Correlation of the Mental Abilities Involved in 
Tests and Training Series. 
We now come to the fifth step in the statistical presen- 
tation of the results of this study, the discussion of the 
way in which the mental abilities involved in test and 
training series are related. In Tables K, L, and M are 
found correlations built up by the Pearson product- 
moment method that show the relationship between effi- 
ciency in the mental abilities measured by each of the 
various tests. They present fairly definite pictures of the 
way in which the abilities of the subjects of this investiga- 
tion are related in the various types of mental manipula- 
tion. Granted that the tests measure efficiency in various 
types of mental manipulation, then jthese correlation 
tables give a further method of showing the relative effects 
of the training course upon our subjects.* In Table VI 
*The author offers this discussion of “correlation” merely as fur- 
ther confirmatory evidence of the “transfer of training” in mental 
manipulation of spatial elements. Taken by themselves, the data 
that follow could not, of course, establish conclusively the possi- 
bility of transfer.
-P-A-G-E-84
72 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
is given a summary of the values of 7, the coefficient of 
correlation, for each of the tests with each of the others 
(both in February and in June) and of certain of the 
tests with the class marks in descriptive geometry. Cor- 
responding unreliabilities (probable errors) are given. 
Certain correlations are also given for corresponding tests 
for the control group in order to establish the fact that 
increase in June correlations over February correlations 
was not due to practice-effect in taking the tests. The 
author has adapted to his problem the method of defining 
and interpreting the correlation coefficient described by 
Professor H. L. Rietz.* 
Two measurable mental abilities may be said to be “correlated”, 
if to any assigned values of one there are corresponding values of 
the other, whose mean values are functions of the selected values, 
“Function” is used here in the sense of a “mathematical function”. 
In this sense the variable ability, e. g., the mental manipulation of 
one type of spatial elements would be said to be a mathematical 
function of the ability to manipulate another type, if to any as- 
signed degrees of efficiency in one there corresponded definite de- 
grees of efficiency in the other. Correlation between two abilities 
suggests causal connections of greater or less degrees. The exist- 
ence of correlation is most commonly represented by means of a 
single coefficient, called the Pearson coefficient of correlation, 7. 
The degree of relationship between abilities is commonly inferred 
from the relative size of this coefficient. Thus, correlation may be 
spoken of as high, marked, low, zero, ete. It can be seen that the 
psychological interpretation of the numerical coefficient depends 
upon the arbitrary placing of the limits of the groups called ‘high’, 
‘low’, ‘marked’, etc. The author’s practice is to regard correlation 
as ‘negligible’ or ‘indifferent’ when r is less than .15 or .20; as 
being present, but ‘low’, when r ranges from .15 or .20 to .85 or .40; 
as being ‘marked’ from .40 to .50 or .60, and as being ‘high’ with 
values of r above .50 or .60. Again, it should be said that relation- 
ships worked by the product-moment method should be interpreted 
with careful regard for the ‘spread’ of the table itself, not from the 
size of the coefficient alone. It should also be emphasized that the 
product-moment method is valid for determining the degree of 
relationship between two quantities when the mean positions of 
successive arrays of the contingency table fall approximately on a 
straight line. The checking up of the linearity of this line of the 
*Bulletin No. 148 of the University of Illinois, Agricultural Ba- 
periment Station.  
-P-A-G-E-85
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 3B 
means of arrays (known from Galton’s terminology as the “line of 
regression”) is absolutely necessary to the valid use of Pearson’s 
product-moment method. The linearity of regression in each of the 
correlation tables drawn up in this study has been checked and the 
Pearson formula shown to be applicable. Much statistical work in 
educational research has been open to the criticism that the appli- 
cability of methods used has not been adequately determined.

Analysis of these correlation tables and of the values of 
r given in Table VI will throw light on certain funda- 
mental issues in our experimental field. The problem may 
be approached by stating certain essential premises and 
then checking these by the statistical results: 
First, if a specific mental ability is measured by two 
mental tests (assuming that the tests are adequate meas- 
ures of the ability in question), the correlation of effi- 
ciency in the two tests should be high, approaching 1.00.
-P-A-G-E-86
74 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
Second, if two mental abilities are largely unlike, i. ¢., 
if they comprise many unlike elements, then the correla- 
tion of efficiency in the two abilities, as measured by the 
same mental test, should be a small, positive one or a nega- 
tive one, and should become the less positive as the abili- 
ties comprise progressively fewer related elements or 
elementary processes. 
Third, if two such unlike mental abilities are influenced 
by a training series so as to affect the same proportional 
increase in the efficiency of both mental abilities, then the 
correlation between the resultant efficiencies in the two 
abilities should remain constant. 
Fourth, if two such unlike mental abilities are in- 
fluenced positively by a training series in wnlike degree 
in such a way as to increase the efficiency in one more 
rapidly than in the other, then the correlation in effi- 
ciency should vary, becoming increasingly higher if the 
training series causes efficiency in one ability to approach 
more closely the efficiency in the other ability. 
A survey of the correlation tables and of the values 
of r leads to the following conclusions: 
First, the high correlations between Tests 1 and 2 indi- 
cate the presence of the same mental ability or of mental 
abilities that comprise very nearly similar elements. 
Second, the correlations obtained for the control sub- 
jects indicate that an increase in the amount of r in the 
ease of the training subjects cannot be ascribed to the 
practice-effects in the tests themselves. 
Third, the correlations between either Tests 1 or 2 and 
3, 4, or 5 indicate the presence of dissimilar abilities, as 
the correlations are lov—on the average less than .20. 
Fourth, the non-geometrical abilities measured by Tests 
1 and 2 have been influenced by the training-series posi- 
tively (as witness the per cent gains indicated in the pre-
-P-A-G-E-87
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 15 
ceding sections) and in such manner as to cause their effi- 
ciency to approach more closely to that of the geometrical 
mental abilities measured by Tests 3, 4, and 5. 
Fifth, the correlations for Tests 1, 2, and 6 indicate that 
Tests 1, 2, and 6 do not measure the same mental abilities. 
They confirm the statements made in the discussion of the 
method of scoring the tests, viz., that the solution of 
Test 6 involves the activity of several elementary abilities, 
some of which are not specifically affected by the training 
course. Were this not true, the correlations of the non- 
geometrical tests should be high, and the correlations of 
the June tests higher than those given in January. 
Sixth, Tests 3, 4, and 5, although designed as measures 
of so-called ‘geometrical’ manipulation, prove to be meas- 
ures of abilities dealing with many unlike elements, for 
the correlations average 0.253. Thus, these mental abili- 
ties previously described as strictly or quasi-geometrical 
mental abilities are probably complexes of simpler mental 
abilities. The figures indicate that these abilities do be- 
long to more closely related fields of mental manipulation 
than do all five tests when taken together. The average 
of the correlations of Tests 8, 4, and 5 with each other is 
0.34, while the average of the correlations of Tests 1 and 2 
with 3, 4, and 5 is 0.27. 
The laborious tabulation and computation of these 
values of 7 at least offers evidence confirmatory of our 
general thesis. It brings out the complexity of the inter- 
action of mental abilities in such seemingly simple and 
related fields as the mental manipulation of spatial ele- 
ments of geometrical types in a way that a discussion of 
absolute efficiency of the training and control groups, 
relative gains, number of gainers, etc., cannot. At the 
same time, it does lend support to the conclusion that 
something in the training received by the training subjects
-P-A-G-E-88
  76 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
raised the efficiency in non-geometrical manipulation, and 
this in spite of the fact that the training as given dealt 
only with geometrical elements. 
4. The Source of Residual Gains in Favor of the Training 
Group. 
Our statistics have established at least three important 
facts: (1) the training group contains a larger proportion 
of gainers than the control group; (2) the average gain 
of the gainers in the training group considerably exceeds 
the average of the gainers of the control group; (3) the 
training group gains in a distinctly larger proportion of 
the tests taken than does the control group. 
During the four months of training something in the 
mental activities of the training group caused a consider- 
ably greater increase of efficiency in the mental manipula- 
tion of spatial elements than was attained by our control 
group. Recalling the conditions of this investigation as 
stated in our description of the problem, we are forced 
to the conclusion that some one or more of the subjects 
of study pursued by the training group during the interval 
contributed the training necessary to increase this effi- 
ciency. To what subject or subjects is this residual 
efliciency due? 
(a) Discussion of the Subject-Matter of Courses Studied 
by the Training Group. 
In choosing a problem for classroom investigation of 
transfer we deliberately selected the manipulation of spa- 
tial elements as the ability to be trained and descriptive 
geometry as the subject of study to train it, because of 
the constancy with which mental manipulation was con-
-P-A-G-E-89
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 7 
sciously made a daily factor in the solution of problems. 
The author was convinced by his experience in teaching 
various subjects of the civil-engineering curriculum and 
by an intensive study of the other engineering curriculums 
that there is no other course of study offered to first and 
second-year students that demands a daily conscious use 
of visualization. Let us first satisfy ourselves of the truth 
of this assertion by an examination of the subject-matter 
of the other courses pursued by our training group during 
the period of training. The courses of study in the engi- 
neering curriculums of the University of Illinois in their 
first two years are made up of prescribed subjects. Ir- 
regularities in our groups are therefore few, and only 12 
different semester-courses are represented in the list of 
elections and prescriptions taken by as many as 10 of the 
training subjects. Descriptive geometry is the one subject 
studied by each of our subjects. Algebra, trigonometry 
and analytic geometry make up the principal require- 
ments in mathematics, and most of the training subjects 
take the last-named course. Of 203 individuals who take 
mathematics, 177, or 87.4 per cent, of them take analytic 
geometry. That the functioning of “mental manipulation 
of spatial elements” in the present teaching of college 
algebra is very slight and may be neglected for the pur- 
poses of this investigation will undoubtedly be agreed. In 
analytic geometry there may be incidental instances in 
which visual factors reinforce the analytic method. How- 
ever, the entire subject is, as its name indicates, of an 
analytical rather than a descriptive nature, and any train- 
ing in visualization received from a semester’s study of 
it must be purely incidental and negligible. 
The chief distinction in grouping concerns the language 
requirements—Hnglish, rhetoric, French or German. In
-P-A-G-E-90
78 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
grouping the subjects into the seven training sub-sections 
the most frequently elected subjects, in common with de- 
scriptive geometry and shop-practice, were found to be 
either a modern language or English. Search for the pos- 
sible training in mental manipulation that might come 
from an elementary course in French, German or Spanish 
indicates that it could function, if at all, only in connec- 
tion with the mastery of vocabulary (memory) and then 
the mental manipulation would probably be largely of the 
auditory or motor rather than of the visual type. Further, 
it can be conceived that constant daily emphasis by the 
instructor on the necessity of exercising the imagination 
in the writing of themes (English) might later be effective 
in increasing efficiency in mental manipulation of a non- 
geometrical type. If so, our statisctics on efficiency of 
training sub-section No. 1 should show a larger gain in 
Tests 1, 2, and 8. This does not prove to be the case, as 
will be shown later. No such daily emphasis is given by 
the average instructor in the teaching of English composi- 
tion or of rhetoric to freshmen engineers. 
Shop-practice and architecture remain as the only other 
courses studied by considerable numbers of the training 
subjects. It is believed that we may neglect the train- 
ing qualities produced in mental manipulation of spatial 
elements by a semester’s work in the machine or forge 
shop and likewise by the purely historical study of archi- 
tecture. The practice in “design” in architecture might 
admittedly contain considerable incidental emphasis on 
visualization. If so, it should result in increased attain- 
ments in mental manipulation on the part of the training 
subjects electing it for study. Especially should this be 
true in the geometrical fields. That it does not do so in 
the case of the few men pursuing studies in this field will 
be brought out a little later in statistics on the efficiency  
-P-A-G-E-91
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 9 
of the training sub-sections. Similarly with the small 
number of individuals studying laboratory and theoretical 
physics and chemistry; here the continued use of appa- 
ratus probably tends to discourage mental manipulation. 
However, even should we grant the possibility of visual 
training coming from the study of chemistry, physics and 
architecture, the small number of individuals that pur- 
sued these studies could not materially affect the statis- 
tical results. 
In brief, then, long study of the ingredients of the va- 
rious engineering curriculums and actual teaching expe- 
rience in at least nine of the courses of the civil engineer- 
ing curriculum convinces me that descriptive geometry 
is the only subject of study pursued by the members of 
the training group that consciously and explicitly offers 
daily training in the mental manipulation of spatial ele- 
ments as an accepted device for the solution of problems, 
and that the training effect for mental manipulation of all 
the other courses studied by the training subjects may be 
considered incidental, intermittent, and negligible for the 
purposes of this investigation. 
(b) Statistical Analysis of the Problem. 
Added strength is given to the foregoing by a statistical 
treatment of the problem. In Table J the data for the 
training subjects are grouped in seven sub-sections, as in- 
dicated in the chapter on “The Subjects.” In this table 
is tabulated, for each training sub-section and for each 
test, 1 to 5 inclusive, the number of individuals gaining 
and the per cent of the total number of individuals gain- 
ing, the average gain of those gaining and the deviations 
of the mean of each training sub-section from the means 
of the whole group. Now, if the courses pursued by any
-P-A-G-E-92
80 THE BXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
one section exert a greater training effect than those of 
any other section, this should be evidenced (in the type of 
visual manipulation trained) by a higher percentage of 
individuals gaining in the tests and by a higher average 
gain. A brief survey of the statistical results for each of 
these sub-sections will now be made. 
Group 1 (55 subjects). English is the particular course 
under analysis. If a semester’s study in English composi- 
tion or rhetoric fulfills a function in training abilities in 
the mental manipulation of non-geometrical elements, the 
per cent of individuals in Group 1 gaining in Tests 1 and 
2 should exceed the per cent gaining in the whole group, 
and their average gain should also be higher. Table J 
tells us, however, that the averages for Group 1, instead of 
being higher than the averages of the entire training 
group in these two tests, are actually very slightly lower. 
The per cent of individuals gaining in Group 1 and the 
entire training group and the deviations of the means 
of per cent gains of Group 1 from the means of the entire 
training group are abstracted in Table VII.

MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 81 
We may say, then, that the results of the tests indicate 
that English courses add nothing to the increased effi- 
ciency of the subjects in mental manipulation of non- 
geometrical elements. 
Group 2. French and German are the particular 
courses under investigation. Practically the same situa- 
tion exists here as with Group 1 (119 individuals pursue 
study in modern languages in addition to descriptive 
geometry, shop-practice and analytic geometry). Here, 
again, we are especially interested in the results of Tests 
1 and 2, as modern languages would affect non-geometrical 
elements if any part of the field of mental manipulation. 
The figures for Group 2 appear in Table VIII:

The figures show that fewer subjects in Group 2 gained 
in Tests 1 and 2 than in the whole training group, and that 
almost the same number gained in Tests 3, 4, and 5, as in 
the whole group. There is clearly little evidence here for 
greater training with non-geometrical elements. The dif- 
ferences in amount gained by Group 2 are slightly positive 
in all tests but Test 3, but they are small throughout, and 
in the case of Tests 1 and 2 are so small as to have no
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 THE DPXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
great weight, for they are smaller than the differences 
for Test 5, a strictly geometrical test. Thus, the statis- 
tical data for the two largest and most important sub- 
sections do not prove the existence of training in visuali- 
zation in any subject of study except that taken by all our 
trained subjects, descriptive geometry. 
Group 3. Since those subjects electing science (physics 
and chemistry) are so few in number (8 individuals), it 
is hardly necessary to discuss their abstracted data in 
detail. Suffice it to say that the gains for the group are 
neither consistently positive nor negative, but distribute 
themselves on both sides of the means of the training 
group. 
Groups 4 and 5. These groups are made up of 20 sub- 
jects electing study in architecture, descriptive geometry 
and analytic geometry. The data for this group appear 
in Table IX.

What can we infer from these figures? First, in the 
non-geometrical tests, averaging the results for Tests 1 
and 2, about as many subjects gain in Groups 4 and 5 as 
in the entire training group; in partially and strictly 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 83 
geometrical tests fewer subjects gain in Groups 4 and 5 
than in the entire training group. Second, the average 
gain of Groups 4 and 5 is in all tests very much lower 
than the average gain of the entire training group. At 
least, it is certain that the courses pursued by these groups 
have not produced efficiency greater than that of the en- 
tire training group. 
Group 6. The 67 subjects of this group were registered 
in advanced courses in science and language, and had 
previously completed the requirements in shop-practice. 
If such material for study has offered training in mental 
manipulation of spatial elements, the figures should in- 
dicate its presence in increased efficiency. The data for 
Group 6 appear in Table X.

With a group of individuals having a possible advan- 
tage in substituting for shop-practice advanced courses 
which might be thought to give added training in mental 
manipulation, the situation is practically the same as in 
the other training sub-sections. There is no consistently 
larger gain or larger number of individuals gaining with 
either non-geometrical or geometrical elements.

Group 7 is a group of 37 subjects, mostly special stu- 
dents who take two mathematics courses, two or more 
English courses, or two or more language courses, and also 
all those who take advanced courses, e. g., mechanics, 
_etce. The data appear in Table XI.

With the exception of Test 2, the proportion of indi- 
viduals gaining in Group 7 is practically identical with 
the proportion gaining in the whole training group, and 
the predominance of negative differences in average gains 
of the group does not indicate that the advanced courses 
have given distinct training in mental manipulation. - 
(c) Summary of the Source of Residual Gains. 
From the analytical discussion of the cause of greater 
increase in efficiency on the part of the training group the 
conclusion is reached that of all the courses of study pur- 
sued by the subjects during the period of training, de- 
scriptive geometry—which was selected as the training 
course because of its constant emphasis on the mental 
manipulation of geometrical spatial elements—was the 
only course whose subject-matter, organization, and meth-
-P-A-G-E-97
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 85 
ods of teaching could so contribute training in mental 
manipulation as to function in the results of the tests. 
From the statistical analysis of the actual performance 
of subjects who pursued different courses of study the con- 
clusion is reached that the statistical evidence does not 
indicate that training actually found could have come 
from any course except the one designed and selected ex- 
pressly for the purpose and studied by all training sub- 
jects of the investigation—descriptive geometry. 
5. The Effect of Training on Different Grades of 
Scholastic Ability. 
The large number of subjects used in this investigation 
makes it possible to contribute evidence on several other 
points of issue in the field of transfer. The first of these 
is: “What effect does a given training series have upon 
different grades of scholastic ability?” 
It was assumed that scholastic ability is approximately 
measured by the marks received in college courses. The 
marks received by each training subject were col- 
lected and are tabulated in Tables A-1, A-2, A-3. The 
courses included mathematics, English, modern languages 
(French, German and Spanish), shop-practice, mechanical 
drawing and descriptive geometry. The mathematics 
mark is, in each case, an average of two or more semester 
marks in freshman algebra, trigonometry and analytic 
geometry; the English mark, an average of two semester 
marks in theme-writing and English composition; the 
modern language mark, an average of two semester marks 
in French, German or Spanish; the marks in drawing, 
shop-practice and descriptive geometry each represent the 
standing in one semester course. For each of the tests 
1, 2, 3, and 5 the 1913 training subjects were next grouped
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
according to initial performance. Each group contained 
only those who had obtained approximately the same in- 
itial efficiency in any one test. For example, all subjects 
were grouped together whose initial efficiency in Test 1 
(as shown by the scoring of the February test-series) was 
between 20 and 30 per cent, between 30 and 47 per cent, 
etc. The use of this method results in groups whose gains 
are comparable. 
The gains in each test were handled separately; de- 
tailed tabulations were made and the individual results 
were distributed under “Gained” or “Not Gained” columns, 
according to the mark received in the various courses 
of study. From these original tables, Summary-Table XII 
was drawn up to show for the two groups of students (the 
one with marks below 75 per cent and the other with 
marks between 85 and 100 per cent) the number gaining 
or not gaining, the per cent gaining or not gaining and the 
average gain. The data presented in Table XII are 
grouped in accordance with marks obtained in mathe- 
matics, in descriptive geometry and in English and modern 
languages. 
With regard to marks in mathematics, the data show 
that a larger proportion of those above 85 than of those 
below 75 gained in 7 out of 10 groupings; the residual 
gains in their favor are for the tests, respectively, 20, 30, 
48, 2, 18.8, 13, and 32 per cent. Those below 75 per cent 
in mathematics show a larger per cent of their number 
gaining in only 8 out of 10 groupings; the residual gains 
in their favor are 13, 4, and 9 per cent. The average gain 
in each test for students above 85 per cent, compared with 
students below 75 per cent, gives almost identical results 
in all but one group.
-P-A-G-E-99
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 87 
With regard to marks in English and modern languages, 
in 4 out of 6 groupings a larger proportion of the students 
above 85 per cent gained than of the students below 75 
per cent; the residual gains in favor of the higher group 
were 4, 13, 14, and 4 per cent. In 2 out of 6 groupings a 
larger proportion of the students below 75 per cent gained 
than of the students above 85 per cent; the residual per 
cents of the number gaining were 7 per cent and 4 per cent. 
Here, again, the amount of gain was with each group ap- 
proximately the same. 
With these representative groupings of the training 
subjects, comparable results in each case permit the fol- 
lowing conclusions: (1) a considerably larger proportion 
of the students who showed high ability in mathematics 
gained in ability in the mental manipulation of spatial 
elements than of the students who showed low ability in 
mathematics; (2) in those groupings in which there was 
a larger proportion of the poor students excelling the good 
students, the differences on the whole were very slight; 
(3) a comparison of the effect of training on good and 
poor students in Hnglish and modern languages shows 
but a very slight advantage for the good students; the 
residuals in all groupings are very small. 
It has been suggested that these statistical results may 
throw light upon the method of transfer in this investi- 
gation. Those who attribute transfer to the development 
of concepts or ideals of method may find here some support 
for their position. Mathematics courses, like algebra, 
trigonometry, analytic geometry and descriptive geometry, 
are primarily “problem” courses; the best success in them 
demands the development of methods of attack or analysis 
which require a conceptualizing ability of a relatively high 
order. This is most clearly brought out in the presenta- 
tion of the course in descriptive geometry. In the working

90 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
of every problem analysis is stressed, because otherwise 
the solution of almost none of the problems is possible. 
The author in his own classes considered the development 
of a “general method” of problem solution to be one of the 
fundamental purposes of the course, and tried to make it 
one of the definite outcomes of his teaching. On the other 
hand, it is improbable that conceptualizing abilities play 
so large a rdle in determining excellence in languages. 
Thus, our argument, since it is to some extent supported 
by our statistical results, leads to the inference that in 
this investigation the method of transfer involves, among 
other things, the conceptualizing of methods of attacking 
problems. Since the training seems to be more effective 
with the high-grade students of mathematics than with the 
low-grade students of mathematics, and to have practi- 
cally identical effects on students of various grades of 
ability in the languages, it may very well be that the train- 
ing ‘carries over’ through this very conceptualizing proc- 
ess. Naturally, there is in this no positive proof that con- 
cepts of method constitute the only agency of transfer. 
6. The Effect of Training Upon Subjects of Various Ages. 
To test the effect of training upon different levels of 
maturity the writer tabulated (in Tables A-1, A-2, A-3) 
the ages of each of the training subjects at the time of 
taking the tests. Distribution tables were drawn up for 
each of the tests 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, showing the number gain- 
ing and the number not gaining for each half-yearly inter- 
val from 16 years to 26 years. Table XIII summarizes 
these facts. 
If we draw a dividing line at 20 years, the figures sum- 
marize as follows: of the subjects 17 to 20 years old, 280 
gain, 185 do not gain; or, in per cents, 60.2 gain and 39.8 
do not gain. Of the subjects 20 to 26 years old, 252 gain

and 158 do not gain; or, in per cents, 62.5 gain and 37.5 
do not gain. Comparing the subjects younger than 18 
years with those older than 22 years, we find 64.4 per cent 
of those younger than 18 years gaining and 57.8 per cent 
of those older than 22 years gaining. It seems then, that 
the training given in the mental manipulation of spatial 
elements affects the abilities of the younger and the older 
adult subjects of this investigation to approximately the 
same degree. 
7. The Correlation of Scholastic Ability in Various 
College Studies. 
The large number of subjects in the training group en- 
ables us to present still other kinds of data often discussed 
in connection with the transfer problem—particularly the 
correlation of ability in various scholastic studies. To 
supply these data the marks received in mathematics, Eng- 
lish or modern languages, descriptive geometry, shop- 
practice and mechanical drawing were tabulated in Tables 
A-1, A-2, A-3, and retabulated in correlation tables M-1 to 
M-8. From these tables the Pearson coefficient of corre- 
lation, r, was next computed to show the relationship be- 
tween scholastic ability in mathematics and in descriptive 
geometry, between ability in mathematics and in modern 
languages, between mathematics and English, mathe- 
matics and shop-practice, mechanical drawing and shop- 
practice. These values of 7 are given in Table XIV. 
The results are confirmatory of the results of a similar 
but more extended study in correlation of scholastic abili- 
ties by Rietz and Shade,* conducted at the University of 
*Rietz and Shade: “Correlation of Efficiency in Mathematics and 
Efficiency in Other Subjects.” The University of Illinois Studies, 
VI, No. 10 (1908).

the two investigations between groups of studies that were 
previously asserted (by such investigators as Lewis of 
Dartmouth**) to be negatively correlated are here in all 
cases positive and are practically identical. It may be 
concluded that the scholastic abilities of the training sub- 
jects of this investigation, as measured by their college 
marks, are positively correlated to a rather marked de- 
gree. Students who show high degrees of ability in certain 
mathematical courses will show practically similar degrees 
of ability in other mathematical courses; students who 
grade high in mathematics will tend to grade high in 
English, modern languages and shop-practice; those high 
in mechanical drawing will tend to do work of a similar 
quality in shop-practice. Thus, the complex abilities 
exhibited in various subjects of study, as measured by 
teachers’ marks,* are positively correlated, and in general 
to a degree that may be characterized as “marked” and in 
many cases as “high.”

  CHAPTER X. 
Tue Tuory or TRANSFER. 
1. Summary of Statistical Results. 
What contributions can this study offer to the discus- 
sion of transfer of training? Do our results indicate that 
the training of one mental ability will produce increased 
efficiency in other mental abilities more or less closely 
related? Does the effect of training in the mental manipu- 
lation of spatial elements, obtained from the definite or- 
ganization of a course of study in geometry, function to 
increase the efficiency of mental manipulation of spatial 
elements in geometrical fields apart from this definite 
organization of the subject-matter of the geometry course 
itself? Does it function in fields only partly geometrical 
or of a different geometrical content? Does it function 
in fields not at all geometrical? 
In formulating answers to these questions we are attack- 
ing the core of the problem of transfer. The issue before 
us is not merely: “Is there a spread of improvement 
among mental abilities?” It has two other and more im- 
portant aspects: first, What is the extent of transfer or 
spread of improvement? How far does the effect spread? 
Second, How was the spread of improvement affected? 
How does it happen that improvement in one mental 
ability, effective in one field of mental activity, is corre- 
94
-P-A-G-E-107
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 95 
lated with improvement in other mental abilities effective 
in seemingly quite unrelated fields? Through what chan- 
nels and by what processes does the spread of improve- 
ment take place? 
“Thus our general problem is threefold (1) Does im- 
provement in one mental ability spread to other abilities? 
(2) If so, how far does it spread? (3) Through what 
agencies does it spread? 
Chapters III to IX, inclusive, have dealt exclusively 
with the first two phases of the general problem. The 
problem has been stated as restricted to a definite field. 
The conditions of selecting subjects, designing tests, giv- 
ing the tests, scoring the test-papers and tabulating re- 
sults have been described in detail above. It must be 
borne in mind that the tests are regarded as measuring 
efficiency in the function studied; that the conditions 
under which they were taken are regarded as normal, and 
as not influencing the progress of the experiment in any 
deleterious way, and that the papers were accurately 
scored and tabulated. 
What, then, has this study shown in regard to the spread 
of improvement in abilities in mental manipulation of 
spatial elements? 
(a) A group of 413 college students received such train- 
ing in the mental manipulation of geometrical spatial 
elements as was naturally given in the conduct of a 
course in descriptive geometry during a collegiate semester 
of 15 weeks. Another group of 87 college students re- 
ceived no such training during that interval. Both groups 
were measured for efficiency in mental manipulation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
96 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
spatial elements before they received training, and the 
trained group proved to be considerably superior to the 
untrained group in manipulating geometrical elements 
and slightly superior to the untrained group in manipulat- 
ing non-geometrical and quasi-geometrical elements. After 
the 15 weeks of training the trained group had increased 
its superiority over the untrained group in all three types 
of problems, geometrical, quasi- and non-geometrical ele- 
ments—this, in spite of the fact that the training had 
been concerned with problems involving strictly geometri- 
cal elements. 
(b) Members of both the trained and untrained groups 
revealed increased efficiency in the problems of the second 
test-series. But there were 44 per cent more gainers in 
speed in the trained group than in the untrained group, 
i. e., nearly half again as large a proportion of the trained 
group gained as of the untrained group. And nearly two- 
thirds again as large a proportion of the trained group as 
of the untrained group gained in accuracy. 
(c) The residual gain of the trained group over that of 
the untrained group was increasingly greater as one 
passed from the non-geometrical abilities to those partak- 
ing more and more of geometrical qualities. That is, the 
students trained in geometrical manipulation gained more 
than did the untrained students in efficiency of the func- 
tions tested, but their gain was greater in those abilities 
that involved the geometrical elements. 
(d) The gainers among the trained students gained in 
a distinctly larger proportion of the tests taken than did 
the gainers of the untrained group. Or, to put it in terms  
-P-A-G-E-109
  
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 97 
more pertinent to the point at issue, the trained students 
gained in efficiency in more kinds of mental manipulation 
of spatial elements than did the untrained students. 
Translated into terms of transfer, what do the above 
facts indicate? They indicate, at least to the author’s 
satisfaction, that the training in mental manipulation of 
a geometrical character received by students in descriptive 
geometry operated (1) so as substantially to increase the 
student’s ability in solving ‘manipulation’ problems of a 
geometrical nature, but entirely unrelated to the content 
of descriptive geometry itself, (2) so as to increase the 
student’s ability in solving manipulation problems of a 
slightly geometrical nature, i. e., those containing the 
fundamental elements of geometry (the point, line and 
plane), but in such form as not to offer the same sort of 
geometrical ‘cues’ to aid in solution, (3) so as to increase 
the student’s ability in solving problems in mental manipu- 
lation of a purely non-geometrical nature, i. ¢., those in 
which the point, line, and plane do not appear in any way 
whatsoever. The training operates more effectively in 
those problems whose visual ‘setting’ the more closely 
resembles the visual imagery involved in descriptive 
geometry. 
2. The Range Over Which Training is Effective. 
From our statistical analysis it would seem that the 
facts argue for the spread of the effect of training mental 
abilities. Consider our data from whatever angle we will, 
we face the fact that the training subjects are relatively 
more efficient after training than before. Practice-effect,
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
increased maturity, and familiarity with the tests have all 
been accounted for carefully by the record of the control 
group, and still there is a distinct residual increased efti- 
ciency in the abilities that were not specifically trained by 
the training course. 
But having satisfied ourselves that the effect of training 
did spread to abilities not specifically trained by the train- 
ing series, can we go further and offer any definite infor- 
mation as to the exact range of this spread of improve- 
ment? Can we say, for example, that with the average 
student the training carried over one-half or four-tenths 
as efficiently into quasi-geometrical fields as it did into 
fields dealing with strictly geometrical elements? Or that 
it carried over one-third or one-fourth as efficiently with 
non-geometrical elements as with strictly geometrical 
elements? 
Obviously we cannot. In order to do so we should 
require a definite measure of the adequacy of each test as 
a measure of the specific abilities tested. If we knew, for 
example, that Tests 1, 2, and 6 measured mental manipu- 
lation of a non-geometrical character to the exact extent 
that Test 3 measured efficiency in mental manipulation of 
a quasi-geometrical character, and that Tests 4 and 5 
measured strictly geometrical manipulation, then we 
should be justified in expressing our relative per cent gains 
in the various tests as ratios of the extent to which train- 
ing had spread. To know that, however, would require 
the solution of a problem in the design of mental tests, 
and in the calibration of mental tests, which in itself 
would be very formidable, and one whose solution has not  
-P-A-G-E-111
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 99) 
been deemed possible as a preliminary step in the conduct 
of this study. 
At best, we must confine ourselves to saying that the 
effect of training is not so evident in non-geometrical 
abilities as in mental abilities dealing with geometrical 
elements, but that at the same time there is unquestionable 
evidence of its presence even there. Careful evaluation 
of the tests used with the various kinds of elements has 
not yet resulted in the assurance that we can express the 
range in definite units of measurement. In future investi- 
gations of this nature the emphasis should be upon this 
phase of the problem, for it clearly is of primary im- 
portance. 
The final question in this invetigation of the transfer of 
training is: How did the effect of training in mental 
manipulation of a strictly geometrical nature spread so 
as to be effective with non-geometrical problems? Through 
what agencies does the improvement of mental abilities 
of this sort spread? How does training in manipulating 
the spatial relations of points, lines, planes, and solids 
raise the level of efficiency in manipulating the numerals 
involved in problems of short division? 
3. The Agencies of Transfer: A Study of the Processes 
Involved in the Solution of Tests of Efficiency in 
Mental Manipulation and in the Solution of De- 
seriptive Geometry Problems. 
Statistics can no longer aid in the solution of the prob- 
lem. It must now be studied through the careful analysis 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
100 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
of all conscious processes involved in manipulating the 
elements of our test problems. We must observe and 
record as minutely as possible each step in the mental 
process of solving both the problems of the tests and the 
problems of descriptive geometry. We must secure intro- 
spections on these processes from trained observers. 
Ideally we should have accurate records of all steps that 
took place in the consciousness of the subjects as they 
solved each of the tests. As the subjects were untrained 
in introspective analysis, this step was, of course, im- 
possible. We did secure from each of our subjects brief 
introspective data on the various tests, but scarcely any 
of them are definite enough to give the information desired. 
For that reason the tests were submitted to four students 
of education and psychology, all of whom had had train- 
ing in introspection. They were also given to a small 
class in descriptive geometry in 1914, with careful direc- 
tions and questions regarding introspection. Each test 
was solved under experimental conditions, and was imme- 
diately followed by the writing of a full description of 
the mental process involved. The subjects were then asked 
to answer, for each test, a list of questions which had 
been designed by the author after many hours of intro- 
spective analysis of the tests and of the solution of de- 
scriptive-geometry problems. In this way a few fairly 
reliable introspections have been secured to aid in the 
discussion of the important question of the method of 
transfer as it applies to this investigation. 
To illustrate definitely the mental processes involved 
in the solution of the tests there are quoted below cer-
-P-A-G-E-113
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 101 
tain pertinent extracts from the introspections which bear 
on the problem of the method of improvement of mental 
abilities. The detailed introspections are much too volu- 
minous and contain too much irrelevant matter for com- 
plete publication. Enough has been quoted to represent 
fairly the records obtained. 
A. Quotations from Introspective Analyses of the 
Imagery Processes Involved in the Tests. 
Test 1. “When instructions were being given, felt that mind was 
receptive ; followed easily with some little interruption of objects 
on desk and thoughts until ‘divide 84 by 17’ came. Then I began 
to try and divide, and became panicky when I could not do it 
quickly. Still followed remarks, but kept trying to divide. When 
sheet with tests was given, tried to regain composure, but still felt 
excited ; which was increased when I failed to retain image of the 
figures in mind. Kept saying them to myself. When I was writing 
down results, did not feel at all certain that they were correct; 
verified two of them by multiplying. Kept referring to sheet to 
find out what numbers were. Toward the last was conscious of 
the time element; tried to hurry; kept wondering if most of the 
students completed them within one minute.” 
“Twice I felt I was putting down wrong answer, but felt too hur- 
ried to go back over problems. Tried to get a system, but in this 
test could not get any. Saw ‘84 by 17’ as 17)84(. Saw these two 
as numerals in this order. But with the problems the divisor was 
over to the right, and I had to bring it over at each operation. 
Imagery very imperfect; could not hold divisor and dividend in 
same image; a discontinuous process.. Had to bring back by an 
effort the two different images, both divisor and dividend. Each 
step involved sense of strain. Distinct motor imagery during the 
process.” 
“Saw one specific number at a time. Could not hold entire prob- 
Jem in mind at once.” 
“Image of figures very vague. I have not as definite an image 
of figures as I have of straight lines. . . . . The mind’s eye 
moves almost continually in this test, but in a very much broken-up 
path. I feel a sense of groping that is not present in definite 
images of geometrical figures. The process is a continual striving
-P-A-G-E-114
102 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
to hold the image of divisor and bring it up to its normal position 
at left of the dividend. . .-. . As process of dividing goes on, 
a feeling of agitation and confusion comes at dealing with so many 
things in the same image.” 
Test 2. Was very tired mentally, as this was the last test. Had 
been feeling exhilarated, but reaction had set in. When told it was 
to be division, felt discouraged. Tried to bring images of eight, six 
and two side by side, but tried several times before I could see 
them related; then looked at divisor—three; compared it with 
eight, had no difficulty in seeing six, or in dividing with two as 
result, but it was difficult to remember the result of subtraction, so 
repeated the process. Then had difficulty in imaging the figure six, 
and then recalling result, comparing them and combining them -in 
one image—then forgot divisor, so had to refer to paper to find 
dividend.” 
“The whole problem was to picture entire numbers, so that the 
second or third numbers of dividend could be recalled when 
needed.” . . . “There was no time to get a systematic method 
started, for in our agitation at the pressure of time we hurry into 
it without such preparation.” . . “A very confusing test 
because the imagery process is so "padly broken up. Feel strain 
always in trying to recall divisor.” 
“The process is decidedly one of fluctuating attention, a constant 
fading out and reviving of the image. Both division tests seem 
more complicated to me than the other tests. The images are in- 
definite and there are many of them. Test 2 is more difficult than 
Test 1 because of having three or four figures in the dividend.” 
Z “Very difficult to translate written words into images of 
numerals.” 
Test 3. “First, an effort to image the letters quickly; second, a 
little resistance that I saw so unclearly; third, an effort to add 
mentally without blurring the image of the letters through divided 
attention. Felt a distinct jolt each time as I moved from one letter 
to another, not nearly so evident, however, as in division tests. 
Much easier than division imagery, not so complicated figures to 
deal with.” 
“Image of the whole word never appeared. Kept repeating 
sound of word; then imaged each letter. Much less strain in this 
test. Required little mental effort, compared to first test, to bring 
up letters as images.” . . . . “While making alphabet, started 
to count lines, then stopped. B and S bothered me; during the 
instructions which followed these two images kept appearing in- 
sistently, wanting to be counted; felt that it was a force outside 
myself presenting these and if I could only stop and count them 
they would not appear. Forgot how to form the letter h, but de- 
cided that whether it was H or h there would be three lines, so 
sometimes imaged it one way and sometimes another.” . 
“Much less strain—did not feel so hurried—may be partly that I
-P-A-G-E-115
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIDS 108 
am getting used to taking the tests.” . 3 “Required little 
mental effort compared with first test to bring letters as images.” 
. . “Got on to a system. Learned to begin with first line of 
letter to left, then at top, then went down.” . . . . “Felt that 
I was solving much more easily, correctly and rapidly ; gave a feel- 
ing of satisfaction. Was disappointed when time was up.” 
“First imaged whole letter, then that image disappeared, and each 
line was brought up separ: ately to consciousness. Related to others 
when whole image would appear; then next line. No image at all 
of written words. Memory purely auditory-motor. Much less 
effort than in Test 1, because had to hold but one image in con- 
sciousness at once. Test 1, on other hand, required bringing into 
consciousness two separate images, comparing them and then doing 
the work, or manipulating them. Both were plane imagery, but 
entirely unlike.” 
“First a blackness, then the letters stand out clearly. Only one 
letter of the word appears at focus of consciousness, Counting of 
strokes goes almost automatically, although a slight break and 
a tendency to confusion comes between letters as the image of next 
letter has to be revived. Counting causes only a slight shift in 
attention, much less than in division tests.” 
“This is much easier than division tests; progress much more 
nearly continuous. There is not so much fluctuating and fading 
out of the images.” 
Test 4. “Had to adjust myself mentally to problem. Read it 
three times. Felt that I could not solve the problem. First con- 
scious that I had to cut the cube, then I was conscious that it was 
painted—color was blue. Then comprehended that answers de- 
pended upon the number and the color. Saw cube distinctly, 
painted light-blue with lines running as a drawing, not as a solid. 
Then, when I began to count, I saw it as a drawing, and only 
realized that it was a solid when I had to count the corner I could 
not see in the drawing—then it stood out as a solid. In second 
operation counted laboriously the cubes, top edges—more rapidly 
those around the sides; then added up the ones in the base—saw 
these little cubes with but two sides painted. Reasoned out that 
there would be one cube to each face with one side painted, so did 
not image cubes after the first one, but added up the faces of the 
cube instead. By process of elimination reasoned that there would 
be but one unpainted. Saw it plainly, light tan wood—felt sorry 
for it.” . . . . “Method required in this test; less mental effort ; 
more difficult than third test, owing to solid image and in compari- 
son with plane surfaces.” 
“Very difficult to get oriented in the problem. Transition from 
plane figures to the cube was troublesome. After first baffling feel- 
ing, the image stood out clearly and the solution came quite easily.” 
“Changing from plane to plane is difficult and there is consider- 
able difficulty in holding entire cube in mind. In reviving image 
of the cube each time, a feeling of uncertainty comes as to which
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
cubes have been counted. The hesitation is not so great as in the 
division tests. The solid is so definite, it is easier to picture.” 
“IT always moved around the cube the same way—horizontally. 
I moved from one edge to another vertically first, later horizon- 
tally. Harder than the word test. I could not hold so many 
blocks and lines. In counting, lost track of some.” 
Test 5. “Saw wedge as a drawing first; only as a solid when I 
had to cotint lines not on paper. Saw triangles and squares as a 
drawing (on one plane). Counted first the lines of the square, be- 
ginning at top and going down around to the right; then counted 
remaining lines bounding top triangle. Then added 2 to result as 
I imaged separately the triangles going round to the right and 
down. Image was in blue lines on white paper.” 
“Saw the box as oblong, about 6 inches by 2 inches. Saw first 
lid, then box. In counting, counted around top of box first; looked 
down inside box, but it was too indefinite—too shadowy to see 
plainly, but have a distinct impression of peering down in. Then 
counted upright lines, then base lines, added to result; saw line 
joining the lid; then the lid—then counted three remaining lines 
and added.” 
“Saw the triangles and squares as a whole figure; first counted 
lines of triangle. Then saw right-hand square, counted remaining 
lines, 8; added them to first, then repeated image in different posi- 
tion and added each time. Felt that I was getting system.” 
“Counted lines of prisms, then of prism and added. Did not go 
around object, but reasoned out number of lines, then added.” 
“Solid figures more difficult than plane figures. See solid first 
as a whole, then image the separate lines.” 
“Saw the triangles as a whole. Comparatively few things to 
image and all seemed well centered—systematized. Feel that they 
would ‘stay put’—whereas the more complicated objects would 
not. Less confusion.” 
“Always see the solid first, then break it up into surfaces, then 
into lines, which I count. As long as I can image on the same 
plane, there seems almost no break. The transition troubles espe- 
cially, because the motion is from one plane to another. When one 
face of the solid is in mind, the others fade out and have to be 
constantly revived.” 
B. Imagery Factors Active in the Solution of Problems 
in Descriptive Geometry. 
Nearly every problem of the course involved images of 
one or more planes, although practically every problem 
is worked by reference to lines; that is, the line seems to
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 105 
be the image ‘unit.’ The planes are always seen bounded 
by lines, generally ‘tied’ into other elements of the prob- 
lems by their ‘traces’ or intersections with the co-ordinate 
planes or other inclined planes. There is a sort of definite 
organization about the imagery content of every problem. 
Lines and planes are always tied together in a more or 
less coherent way. 
There are no definite counting processes in the de- 
scriptive geometry problems. Each problem involves the 
movement of elements in the visual field. The lines and 
planes are passed in space, not fixed to a definite position. 
There is constant motion of the elements, called “revolu- 
tion,” in which lines and planes move about various axes. 
This movement of elements is always of an organized 
sort—I mean there is a general effect of smoothness in 
working and little sense of the break or confusion so fre- 
quently spoken of in the tests for mental manipulation. 
In résumé, in practically all descriptive-geometry prob- 
lems: (1) there is a visual fixation of several elements 
at the same time (points, lines and planes) in various 
angular positions in space; nearly all problems contain 
many elements and give practice in fixing several things 
in the same image and in maintaining and manipulating 
such elements. (2) The diversity of elements in the image 
is accompanied by a certain synthesis of organization 
through many connecting links, which aids in the reviving 
of needed elements. (3) The factor of systematic move- 
ment of the elements of the image, characteristic of so 
many problems, seems to lessen the strain of concentra- 
tion on, or of reviving, the image. Movement is thus of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
106 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
continuous and unbroken nature, and is nearly always 
expressed in terms of revolution around some fixed axia. 
C. Summary of the Specific Processes Involved in the 
Solution of Both Test Problems and De- 
scriptive Geometry Problems. 
Thus, the training in mental manipulation received in 
descriptive geometry includes an emphasis on (1) the 
focalization of many geometrical spatial elements in the 
same image, (2) the systematic organization of the many 
elements of the image as aids to maintaining all in con- 
sciousness and to readily recalling those needed, (3) the 
continuous movement of the component elements of the 
imagery content. The latter two clearly operate to de- 
crease feelings of strain and confusion, and all three fac- 
tors are effective in developing attitudes of confidence in 
dealing with complex imagery material of a geometrical 
nature. 
What does a résumé of introspections of students on 
transfer (in answer to questions on the methods of work- 
ing the tests) and of the other subjects bring out concern- 
ing the imagery processes involved in each test? The 
essential facts will be presented in condensed form, with 
some interpretative comment. 
Tests 1 and 2. Relatively complex images, containing 
a large number of separate steps; 90 per cent of the sub- 
jects do not use the multiplication tables, but image each 
specific step in the dividing process. [It should be noted 
that those using the automatic devices of the tables are 
those ranking higher in general ability in the descriptive- 
geometry course.] Test 2 is believed to be harder than 
Test 1, because of increased number of elements and in-
-P-A-G-E-119
  
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIDS 107 
creased number of visual steps. The process is decidedly 
discontinuous—movement of the images is very disor- 
ganized and not systematic. Images so diverse as to be 
very difficult of focalization and retention. Considerable 
evidence of attempts to organize methods of solution. 
Some subjects developed “system” unconsciously. Audi- 
tory and motor imagery quite prevalent. Pressure of 
time emphasizes the experimental nature of the problem. 
Recognition of complexity brings on “panicky” feelings 
of agitation—described as “like the examination feelings 
of the classroom.” Feelings of discomfort and inability 
were prevalent. Images of specific elements were in- 
definite. 
Test 3. Fewer elements involved in the process. Less 
strain and less sense of break between the letters than be- 
tween the steps of Tests 1 and 2. Strain seems to increase 
with the number of elements. Very few elements can be 
held in focus at once. Three lines seems to be the limit. 
Limited range of attention. Those subjects having the 
greatest range seem to be the more efficient. Greater con- 
tinuity and organization of the path of the mind’s eye. 
Plane imagery seems to offer less difficulty. Definiteness 
of mechanical letters resulted in much greater facility in 
focalizing and manipulating images. Images are more 
concrete than the figures of Tests 1 and 2. Tests 1, 2 and 
3 are all of single-plane imagery, but the content and the 
processes involved are distinctly unlike. Test 3 is re- 
garded on the whole as difficult, because it contains less 
familiar material for imagery and a large number of ele- 
ments. : 
Test 4. Much more complex in analysis. Considerable 
feeling of discontinuity of movement of mind’s eye in 
changing from one plane to another. The image is lost
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
more easily at those breaks, and has constantly to be 
revived. There seems to be a distinct difference in speed 
and continuity with which imagery on one plane is con- 
trasted with three-dimensional imagery. Imagery of three- 
dimensional objects (of a geometrical character) is for- 
eign to the customary imagery-content of those persons 
not working or studying in technical fields. To the tech- 
nical student there is an easy adjustment to such a geo- 
metrical content. Two-thirds of the subjects regard Test 
4 as more difficult than 1, 2, or 3, although the outline of 
the image of the cube is quite concrete and distinct. 
Test 5. There are large individual differences in tend- 
encies toward two- and three-dimensional imagery; some 
subjects, wherever possible, see things as solids; others 
invariably picture them on one plane (as in pictorial 
views). Less difficulty is found with more common ob- 
jects than with less common objects, like the pyramid and 
the prism. Those tests are easier to focalize and manipu- 
late which have fewer elements. The thing at the focus 
of consciousness is always the ‘working unit,’ the line. 
In all tests except 1 and 2 this unit is definite and easily 
focalized. Solids and planes are always broken up into 
lines. Rapidity and accuracy of manipulation are facili- 
tated in a content that is well organized and tied to- 
gether by clearly marked lines. Difficulty seems to depend 
on degree of familiarity and on the increase in number of 
elements in the visual field. A peculiar tendency is evi- 
dent to image in three-dimensional positions many plane 
figures which contain diverse combinations of elements, 
e. g., the triangles and squares of Test 5. Subjects feel 
that the image can be made more definite in that way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 109 
D. Generalized Factors Present in Several Tests. 
In addition to the specific factors mentioned above, 
there have been developed in the training course certain 
generalized factors that are closely linked together in 
operation and that clearly function in many or all of the 
tests in the case of the training subjects. These may be 
classified as follows: 
(1) The building up of a large number of imagery con- 
cepts to which the subject can react with his specific 
images, e. g., many definite image-concepts of combina- 
tions of lines and planes in space, a large and yet particu- 
larized background of geometrical concepts—lines, planes, 
solids, triangles, squares, prisms, etc. 
(2) Attitudes of orientation (a) in the field of general 
visual manipulation, (b) in the field of specific visual 
manipulation. 
(3) Feelings of familiarity with the materials or con- 
tent of imagery. 
(4) Specific habits of initial adjustment to visual prob- 
lems. In addition, the actual working of the test prob- 
lems is complicated by the setting up of general feelings 
of agitation and strain, the ‘examination’ feelings that 
have been mentioned, feelings of excitement in the actual 
working of the problems, which are accentuated by pres- 
sure or hurry due to the time element in the test taking. 
E. Analysis of the Process of Mental Manipulation of 
Spatial Elements and Résumé of the Effective 
Agencies of Transfer. 
Having brought out above the various factors, both 
specific and general, involved in the process of visual 
manipulation, let us state briefly the steps involved in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
process itself, endeavoring to find out in just what way the 
training course has contributed practice in any .of these 
steps. The process involves first, the particularizing of 
the concept of the thing in question; second, a reaching 
out for specific ‘cues’ to which the individual can respond ; 
third, a resistance to outside influences (a negligible fac- 
tor if a high degree of attention is secured), and fourth, 
a ‘flashing-up’ of the image. The formation of the concept 
is a function of the range and accuracy of previously ac- 
quired knowledge. The rapidity and accuracy of adjust- 
ment from concept to specific situation is, in an important 
measure, a function of the efficiency of the specific visual- 
izing abilities of the subject and of the intensity of atten- 
tion; it also involves certain attitudes of orientation in 
the general visualizing field. These attitudes depend 
largely on familiarity with the imagery content. 
The training course has built up a number of geometri- 
cal concepts used in the solution of descriptive geometry 
problems. It has given practice in reacting to specific 
geometrical ‘cues, and has been efféctive in establishing 
certain definite visualizing tendencies. This, in itself, has 
tended to eliminate the phase of ‘groping’ or ‘feeling’ for 
the adjustment, and has made this adjustment largely 
habitual and well-nigh instantaneous. The course has de- 
veloped a thorough feeling of familiarity with the geo- 
metrical materials or content found in the geometrical 
tests, and has developed through constant practice an 
habitual attitude of orientation in the general field of 
visualization. We might almost say that there has been 
formed a ‘skill’ of visualizing, a quickness and accuracy 
in response that operates more efficiently in the second 
test series than in the first. 
Thus we conclude that the agencies of transfer in the 
training of abilities in the mental manipulation of spatial
-P-A-G-E-123
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES aE 
elements are four in number: (1) Many specific adjust- 
ments or reactions to familiar cues of visualization have 
tied together training and test series and have undoubt- 
edly acted as agencies through which more efficient re- 
sponse is made to new situations. (2) An important 
phase of the successful response to a new situation is the 
building up of attitudes of orientation in the general 
visual field. (3) Practice in extending the range of atten- 
tion has given increased facility in holding and manipu- 
lating a large number of visual elements at the same time. 
(4) The study of the effect of training upon various grades 
of scholastic ability pointed to the probable effectiveness 
of conceptualizing abilities in developing methods of 
analysis or attack. The introspective material confirms 
the view that these conceptualizing abilities play an im- 
portant part in determining the method of transfer (wit- 
ness the many references to the attempts “to get a sys- 
tem ;” to develop a method, etc.). 
That the foregoing agencies are active in both test and 
training series is evident. Just in what degree and in 
what measure they are related we cannot definitely say; 
but that they do account for the residual gains on the part 
of the trained subjects there is no longer any doubt in the 
mind of the writer. 
F. Further Interpretive Comment. 
(a) The Influence of Certain Experimental Conditions 
in the Study. 
Even though this investigation was carried on under 
as nearly normal classroom conditions as it was possible 
to obtain with unusual precautions, there is evidence that 
the ‘time’ element furnished a cause for distraction and  
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
strain peculiar to the laboratory type of educational psy- 
chology experimentation. We have still far to go in our 
search for methods of classroom testing of specific abili- 
ties which will eliminate attitudes or states of mind so 
unusual or abnormal as these feelings of agitation and 
excitement. Thoroughly rated tests, to be taken natu- 
rally by students, must be a part of the regular organiza- 
tion of the course, like recitations, quizzes, and laboratory 
work, and they must appear as a recognized phase of the 
regular work. It was clear that this could not be accom- 
plished in the conduct of this investigation, and the diffi- 
culties pertaining to all such classroom testing of ability 
seem at the present time almost insurmountable. We be- 
lieve, however, that the unusual or ‘experimental’ atmos- 
phere has been reduced to a minimum in the giving of 
these tests. It seems clear that such abnormal conditions 
as may have been present operated to hinder transfer 
rather than aid it, so that the statistical results and con- 
clusions from this study cannot be affected by this factor. 
(b) Drill in Extending the Range of Attention and 
Manipulation. 
In the problems of the descriptive geometry course con- 
siderable training was given in focalizing and manipulat- 
ing images which involve the holding in mind simultane- 
ously and concurrently many elements. Tests 3 and 6 
are so organized that one can focalize one element of the 
object at a time, count it and drop it from the visual 
field. In Tests 1 and 2, however, one is compelled to focal- 
ize several elements simultaneously or to be constantly 
reviving those which have faded out. The practice in 
extending the range of attention so essential to this skill 
(i. e., increasing the number of elements which can be 
retained and manipulated at once), and of dealing with
-P-A-G-E-125
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 113 
many elements in the image at one time, as obtained in the 
training course, undoubtedly was effective in the second 
test series in Tests 1 and 2 as well as in those tests whose 
content more closely resembles that of the descriptive 
geometry course. 
(c) The Fallacy of the “Geometrical Imagination.” 
It seems perfectly clear from a study of all of the sta- 
tistical and introspective data that there can be no such 
mysterious “ability” as geometrical or non-geometrical 
“imagination.” There are probably a large number of 
specifically distinct imaginal activities which are pre- 
dominantly concerned with geometrical elements, and 
which operate more efficiently in a geometrical ‘setting.’ 
It is also undoubted that there is a large number of 
imaginal activities in which no geometrical elements ap- 
pear. Efficient response to one non-geometrical situation 
will be highly correlated with efficient response to other 
so-called non-geometrical situations, but will not imply 
a like degree of efficiency in the others. Similarly with 
geometrical manipulating functions: abilities in these are 
correlated to a considerable extent, although hardly 
enough to be called a high relationship (r = .380 to .45), 
and will vary largely with the specific content of the situa- 
tion. In general, our results point to the tremendous com- 
plexity of the mental activities involved in the study of 
school subjects, even in fields so seemingly simple as visual 
manipulation. It would seem that we should study the 
efficiency of the learning process in various school subjects 
by analyzing each complex into its special outcomes. For 
example, “abilities in plane geometry” should be analyzed 
into its constituent special outcomes as memory of defini- 
tions, power of applying definitions, memory of rules, 
power of applying principles, accuracy in construction, 
ete.

  CHAPTER XI. 
SumMary oF CONCLUSIONS. 
A. Does Training Transfer? 
The study of descriptive geometry (under ordinary class- 
room conditions throughout a semester of 15 weeks) in 
which such natural and not undue consideration is given 
to practice in geometrical visualization as is necessary for 
the solution of descriptive geometry problems operates: 
(1) Substantially to increase the students’ ability in 
solving problems requiring the mental manipulation of a 
geometrical nature, the content of which are distinctly 
different from the visual content of descriptive geometry 
itself. 
(2) Substantially to increase the students’ ability in 
solving problems requiring the mental manipulation of 
spatial elements of a slightly geometrical character, i. ¢., 
problems utilizing the fundamental elements of geometry 
(the point, line and plane), but apart from a geometrical 
setting, and in such form as to offer no geometrical aids 
in solution. 
(8) Substantially to increase the students’ ability in 
solving problems requiring the mental manipulation of 
spatial elements of a completely non-geometrical nature, 
i. e¢., problems in which the straight line and plane do not 
appear in any way whatsoever. 
(4) The training effect of such study in descriptive 
geometry operates more efficiently in those problems whose 
visual content more closely resembles that of the training 
course itself, i. ¢., in those problems whose imagery content 
is composed of combinations of points, lines and planes, and 
114
-P-A-G-E-127
MENTAL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOL STUDIES 115 
in which the continuity of the manipulating movements 
approaches the continuity of those in the training course. 
B. Does Training Transfer in Like Degree with Various 
Grades of Scholastic Ability? 
If students are grouped on a basis of scholastic ability 
in ‘disciplinary’ or ‘training’ courses, such as the various 
college courses in mathematics, the semester’s training 
received in descriptive geometry operates more effectively 
with the high-grade student than with the low-grade stu- 
dent. If subjects are grouped on a basis of scholastic 
ability in English and modern languages, the training is. 
equally effective with all grades of scholastic ability. 
There are thus decided implications that the method of 
transfer is determined largely in terms of ‘conceptualizing’ 
abilities. 
C. What is the Relative Effect of Training on Adults of 
Varying Ages? 
Within the limits represented by this study (17 to 26 
years) the age of the subject does not seem to be a factor 
in determining the effect of training on his ability in the 
mental manipulation of spatial elements. 
D. What Are the Agencies of Transfer? 
It is concluded from this study that the agencies of 
transfer are the following: 
1. Many specific adjustments or reactions to familiar 
cues of visualization have tied together training and test 
series, and have undoubtedly acted as bonds or agencies 
through which more efficient response is made to a given 
situation.
-P-A-G-E-128
  
116 THE EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF 
2. An important phase of the successful response to a 
new situation is the building up of attitudes of orientation 
in the general visual field. 
3. Practice in extending the range of attention has 
given increased facility in holding and manipulating a 
large number of visual elements at the same time. 
4, The study of the effect of training on various grades 
of scholastic ability pointed to the probable effectiveness 
of conceptualizing abilities in developing methods of 
analysis and attack. The introspective material confirms 
the view that these conceptualizing abilities play an im- 
portant part in determining the method of transfer. 
E. The Possibility of “Disciplinary Outcomes” in School 
Studies. 
The possibility of one ‘disciplinary outcome’ in a spe- 
cific school subject, i. ¢., ability in the mental manipula- 
tion of spatial elements, has been established in this in- 
vestigation. The writer believes that formal school sub- 
jects find a large part of their disciplinary value in the 
developing of this ability to analyze the problem and to 
organize a method of procedure; to build up ideals, or to 
organize a method of attack. But it is undoubted that 
they also make habitual, or automatic, many specific con- 
stituents of the complex abilities that function in many 
complex situations. The successful habitualizing of these 
specific reactions is accentuated by the building up of a 
background of fundamental attitudes of orientation, or 
familiarity with the contenc of the situations to be met. 
It may be increased by the accompaniment of practice in 
extending the range of attention.

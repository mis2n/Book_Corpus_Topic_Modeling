“ Your institution has taken a strong root, and will flourish; and I feel some degree of 
pride in reflecting that a century hence, when this nascent village [ Athens] shall embosom a 
thousand of the Gcorgian youths, pursuing the paths of science, it will now and then be said 
that you gave this land, and I was on the forlorn hope.’”—PRESIDENT MEIGS: Letter to 
Governor Milledge, May 11, 1803. 
   “Tt [the University of Georgia] was the creation of no one man or set of men; it was the 
gift of no political party; it was the offspring of no religious or denominational sect; it drew

ple, and for the people.”—Cuaries Z. McCorp: Address to Alumni, 1885. 
“* Had we carried out the views of her carly patriots, and the framers of our first Consti- 
tution, Georgia would now have a system of education equal, if not superior, to that of any 
State in the Union.”—PRESIDENT CHURCH, in 1845.

“Tt is not population we want. But we do want @ population educated to know how to

dence has given us more than we know what to do with. Nor, indeed, are we wanting in 
those higher qualities which ennoble the private and the organic tife of a people. What we

LETTER. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU GF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., October 10, 1888, 
The Honorable the SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, * 
Washington, D. C. 
Sir: The present monograph was prepared by Mr.Charles Edgeworth 
Jones, of Augusta, Ga., a son of the historian of that State, and late 
graduate student of Johns Hopkins University. The work was under- 
taken by my direction under the supervision of Dr. Herbert B. Adams, 
editor of the present series of Contributions to American Educational 
History, and authorized by your predecessor. 
Mr. Jones discusses the history of education in the State of Georgia. 
The inquiry has been carefully prosecuted, and all available sources of 
information appear to have been intelligently utilized. 
The paper opens with a sketch of the educational advantages afforded 
by the few schools which existed during the colonial epoch. 
The formation and conduct of academies after the Revolutionary War 
are next considered. Among the more prominent were the academies 
of Sunbury and of Richmond County, which exerted a marked influence 
at that early period, and constituted the most important factors in the 
education of the sons of the infant Commonwealth. 
The author then addresses himself to a review of the elementary edu- 
cation afforded in the rural schools, the teachers of which were sup- 
ported by the tuition derived from the attending scholars. Carefully, 
and with an exhaustive analysis of the laws and constitutional provi- 
sions bearing upon the subject, are the rise, development, and decadence 
of the “ poor school system” noted. 
Prior to the late Civil War steps had been taken to establish a system 
of common schools accessible to all white children between the ages of 
six and eighteen. They were, however, interrupted by the War, and it 
was not until some five or six years after the cessation of hostilities 
that the present system of public schools was inaugurated. With the 
opportunities presented by this system for the instruction of the youths 
of the Siate this paper deals fully. 
Having discussed these preliminary topics, Mr. Jones turns his atten- 
tion to the history and present status of higher education in Georgia,

as represented in the University of the State and its branches, in vari- 
ous denominational colleges, and in special institutions designed to 
facilitate studies in law, medicine, theology, science, and art. All chari- 
table and literary institutions ministering to intellectual, social, and 
moral improvement receive due consideration. 
Upon a review of the whole subject, it will be seen that education in 
Georgia, both elementary and superior, is practically free, and that 
within the borders of that State there is no present excuse for illiteracy. 
The publication of this contribution to American educational history 
is respectfully recommended. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

  EDUCATION IN GHORGIA. 
CHAPTER I. 
EARLY SCHOOLS IN GEORGIA. 
THE ORPHAN HOUSE AT BETIIESDA.! 
The earliest efforts toward education in Georgia found expression in 
the school for the religious instruction of the Indians, located at Irene, 
under the conduct of the Moravians,? and in the Orphan House estab- 
lished at Bethesda, near Savannah, by the Rev. George Whitefield, in 
association with his friend the Hon. James Habersham. The former 
of these continued for only a few years, its existence terminating with 
the departure of the Moravian settlers for Pennsylvania, in 1738. The 
other claims a more extended notice, since it constituted the most 
prominent institution of learning in the colony prior to the Revolution.’ 
ORGANIZATION BY CHARLES WESLEY AND GEORGE WHITEFIELD. 
The idea of founding an orphan house in Georgia was suggested by 
the ev. Charles Wesley, who, at his meeting with Mr. Whitefield in 
1737, convinced him of the educational wants of the plantation and the

* One of the earliest school-masters in the colony was Charles Delamotte, the son 
of a London merchant and a friend of the Wesleys, who arrived in Savannah early 
in 1736, (Jones’s History of Georvia, Vol. I, p. 204.)

  immediate necessity for supplying them. Accordingly, the latter hav- 
ing previously by a personal visit to the colony satisfied his mind of 
the justness and expediency of the project, petitioned the Georgia 
trustees, from whom he received a grant of five hundred acres of land 
as a home for his proposed institution. His next business was to 
procure the funds requisite for the erection of buildings. With this 
object in view, Whitefield commenced preaching in the fields. His 
efforts were eminently successful. “ So wonderful,” we are told, “ were 
these open-air ministrations, so eloquent was he in utterance, and so 
powerful in thought and argument, that multitudes flocked to hear him.” 
English liberality was not tardy in responding to his summons, and 
the contributions to his orphan house multiplied so rapidly that, when 
he returned to Georgia early in 1740, his receipts amounted to more 
than one thousand pounds sterling. 
Before his arrival his friend, Mr. Habersham, had located the five- 
hundred-acre grant about ten miles from Savannah, and had begun to 
clear and stock the land. Meanwhile such orphans as he had collected 
were entertained and instructed in a house hired for that purpose. 
Years afterward, in reviewing his conduct’ in connection with the incep- 
tion of the institution, Mr. Whitefield remarked: 
“Had I proceeded according to the rules of prudence I should have 
first cleared the land, built the house, and then taken in the orphans; 
but I found their condition so pitiable and the inhabitants so poor, that 
I immediately opened an infirmary, hired a large house at a great rent, 
and took in, at different times, twenty-four orphans.” 
The first collection made in America in aid of the Orphan House was 
at the church of the Rev. Mr. Smith, in Charleston, 8. C., early in March, 
1740. Mr. Whitefield was on a visit to that place, having gone there to 
meet his brother, who was a ship captain. He was invited to deliver a 
public address in behalf of his Georgia orphans, and the contribution 
amounted to seventy pounds. On the 25th of that month, with his own 
hand, he “laid the first brick of the great house which he called Be- 
thesda, 7. ¢., house of mercy.”! At this time the orphans under his 
charge numbered forty. Besides them, there were about sixty servants 
and workmen to be paid and fed. Having but little to his credit in bank, 
he again departed to influence subscriptions of money and provisions. 
By the 5th of June he was welcomed in Savannah, bringing for Bethesda 
money and supplies valued at more than five hundred pounds. His fam- 
ily, ashe termed them, now numbered one hundred and fifty, and their 
subsistence and compensation depended entirely upon his exertions. 
He could take no rest, and in a little while was off for Charleston on 
his way to the populous northern provinces, where the balance of the 
year was consumed in preaching, and whence he returned to the Or- 
!'This structure, which was finished the same year, was of wood, and measured 
seventy by forty feet. (Union Society Records, 1750-1858. )

phan House on the 14th of December, having, during his absence, deliv- 
ered one hundred and seventy-five discourses in public, and secured 
“upward of seven hundred pounds sterling in goods, provisions, and 
money for the Georgia orphans.” Having spent a happy Christmas with 
his charge, committing the management of the temporal affairs to 
Mr. Habersham, and leaving Mr. Jonathan Barber as superintendent 
of spiritual concerns at Bethesda, he departed early in January, 1741, 
for England. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE ORPHAN HOUSE. 
The general arrangements of the institution at this time, and the 
routine of duties observed by the orphans, are minutely described by 
an eye-witness, who, alter mentioning that the House contained sixty- 
eight children, the whole family numbering eighty-four persons, besides 
nineteen laborers about the premises, says: “The bell rings iv the 
morning at sunrise to wake the family. When the children arise, they 
sing a short hymn, pray by themselves, go down to wash, and by the 
time they have done that, the bell calls to public worship, when a por- 
tion of Scripture is read and expounded, a psalm sung, and the exercises 
begin and end with prayer. They then breakfast, and afterward some — 
go to their trades, and the rest to school. At noon, they all dine in the 
same room, and have comfortable and wholesome diet provided. A 
hymn is sung before and after dinner. Then, in about a half an hour, to 
school again; and between whiles they find time enough for recreation. 
A little after sunset, the bell calls to public duty again, which is per- 
formed in the same manner as in the morning. After that, they sup and 
are attended to bed by one of their masters, who then prays with them, 
as they often do privately.” 
Upon his return from Europe, Mr. Whitefield ascertained that the num- 
ber of children had so greatly increased, that, in a short time, he made 
another voyage to renew his exertions in their behalf. Of the prosper- 
ous condition in which he found Bethesda on the occasion of his next 
visit, we are apprised by one of his letters, written in 1746: “ Many of 
the boys,” he writes, “have been put out to trades, and many girls put 
out to service. I had the pleasure the other day to see three boys at 
the house in which they were bred—one of them out of his time, a 
journeyman, and the others serving under their masters. One that I 
brought from New England is handsomely settled in Carolina; and 
another from Philadelphia is married, and lives very comfortably in 
Savannah.” In the following year Mr. Whitefield purchased a planta- 
tion of six hundred and forty acres of excellent land in South Carolina, 
and placed several negro slaves upon it; the profits and products of 
this investment were applied to the support of the orphan asylum at 
Bethesda. .

  14 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
PETITION FOR A COLLEGE CHARTER. 
Conceiving the design of converting the Bethesda Orphan House 
into ‘‘a seminary of literature and academical learning,” Mr. Whitefield 
on the 18th of December, 1764, submitted to His Excellency James 
Wright, Esq., ‘‘ Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of His Majesty’s 
Province in Georgia,” and to ‘the members of His Majesty’s Council 
in the said Province,” a memorial, in which he called their attention to 
the fact that no institution of that character had as yet been founded 
south of Virginia; ‘and consequently [he continues] if a college could 
be established here (especially as the last addition of the two Floridas 
renders Georgia more centrical for the southern district) it would not 
only be highly serviceable to the rising generation of this colony, but 
would probably occasion many youths to be sent from the British West . 
India Islands and other parts. The many advantages accruing thereby 
to this province must be very considerable.”! 
The Georgia authorities heartily applanded and indorsed this design 
of Mr. Whitefield, whose next step was to proceed to England, that he 
might, by personal influence, obtain from the Crown the necessary sanc- 
tion and assistance. That the matter might be brought directly to the 
notice of His Majesty, Mr. Whitefield prepared and delivered into the 
hands of the clerk of the Privy Council another memorial, in which he 
prayed for a charter upon the plan of the College of New Jersey, and 
expressed his readiness “to give up his present trust and make a free 
gift of all lands, negroes, goods, and chattels which he now stands pos- 
sessed of in the Province of Georgia, for the present founding and 
toward the future support of a College to be called by the name of 
Bethesda College in the Province of Georgia.” His earnest wish was 
to obtain a college charter “upon a broad bottom,” to, provide proper 
masters to instruct and prepare for literary honors many youths who, 
in Georgia and the adjacent provinces, were desirous of superior edu- 
cational advantages, to inaugurate a liberal trust which would. endure 
long after he was gathered to his fathers, and to know that his beloved 
Bethesda would not only be continued as a house of mercy for poor 
orphans, but would also be confirmed to the latest posterity “as a seat 
and nursery of sound learning and religious education.”? 
This favorite and crowning scheme of Whitefield’s life was never 
consummated. His petition for a college charter was refused. Heavy 
as was his disappointment on account of this failure, he did not allow 
himself to be daunted. Abandoning the idea of a college, he deter- 
mined, if possible, to make Bethesda an academy similar in its plan to 
one then established in Philadelphia, which sustained a high reputation. 
Revisiting Bethesda in 1769, he reports that everything there exceeded

his most sanguine expectations. During this year two wings had been 
added to the main building for the accommodation of students, Gov- 
ernor Wright himself laying the corner-stone in March. 
Mr. Whitefield remained at Bethesda some five months or more, giv- 
ing personal and continual attention to the affairs of the institution. 
DEATH OF WHITEFIELD AND FAILURE OF THE ORPHAN HOUSE. 
But the care proved too arduous for him, and, with impaired health 
and a fast declining constitution, he made a trip to the North, only to be 
arrested by illness at Newburyport, Mass., where he died early on the 
morning of the 30th of September, 1770. By his will the Orphan House 
estate was vested in Lady Selina, Countess Dowager of Huntingdon;' 
and upon her demise, which occurred in June, 1791, it passed into 
the hands of thirteen persons, who were specially appointed trustees 
ot Bethesda College,’ then duly named and incorporated.* 
Shortly after Whitefield’s death, the Orphan House was consumed by 
tire. It was afterward partially rebuilt, but in the course of a few 
years suffered a second demolition by hurricane'and fire. Those charged 
with its conduct became seriously embarrassed by these casualties and 
the lack of funds, and the institution soou ceased to have an active ex- 
istence. By act of December 22, 1808, the Legislature directed the 
trustees to sell the estate, and, all debts being paid, to provide for the 
distribution of the proceeds among certain eleemosynary institutions 
in the city of Savannah. In 1854 the Board of Managers of the Union 
Society purchased a part of the original Bethesda tract, and upon the 
very spot formerly occupied by Whitefield’s Orphan House erected 
buildings for the accommodation of the boys committed to their chari- 
table care. “Thus happily,” exclaims Colonel Jones,® “is the philan- 
thropic scheme of the most noted of English pulpit orators, who ‘loved 
to range in the American woods,’ who was never happier than when 
    
1“And whereas there is in this State a very considerable property, as well real as 
personal, known and distinguished by the name of Bethesda College, or Orphan 
House estate, originally intended for an academy, and devised in trust by the late 
Reverend George Whitefield, for literary and benevolent purposes, to Selina, Countess of 
Huntingdon. Be it enacted, etc.” (Section ILI of Act of February 1, 1788. Watkins’s 
Digest, p. 373.) 
2Mr. Whitefield in his will had expressed the wish that, as soon as might be after 
his decease, the plan of the intended Orphan House or Bethesda College might, be 
prosecuted, 
% Act of December 20, 1791. (Marbury and Crawford’s Digest, p. 566.) 
+One-fifth of the net proceeds was to be applied to the uses of the Savannah Poor 
House and Hospital Society ; and of the remainder of such net sum, one-half was to be 
paid to the Union Society in Savannah, and the other half to the Chatham Academy 
(which was established by Act of February 1, 1788), to increase their funds for the in- 
struction of youth generally; the proviso in the case of the latter being that it should 
support and educate five orphans. (John A. Cuthbert’s Digest of School Laws, 
Milledgeville, 1832. Pp. 47-8.)

‘holding a levee of wounded souls,’ and whose generous arms were ever 
open to succor the poor and the orphan, perpetuated in the living 
present.” 
In another place,' referring to the valuable services performed by 
the school at Bethesda, the same author says: “ That this orphan 
house, in the face of many disappointments connected with its advance- 
ment to the stage of usefulness and prosperity anticipated and predicted 
for it, was.an institution of great benefit to the colony, and that its 
sheltering arms ministered to the comfort of many homeless orphans 
and pointed the way to future industry, respectability, and independ- 
ence, cannot be questioned. True it is that several persons who ex- 
ercised a controlling influence over Georgia affairs during the last 
quarter of the eighteenth century were wards of this charity.” ?

CHAPTER II. 
SCHOOLS AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, 
THE ACADEMY OF RICHMOND COUNTY. 
Some months had elapsed after the signing of the Declaration of In- 
dependence wheu Georgia took her next step in educational progress. 
This was effected under the Constitution of 1777, the fifty-fourth section 
of which provided that schools should be erected in each county, and 
supported at the general expense of the State.t During the Revolu- 
tionary War, such were the distractions of the period and of the com- 
munity, that all efforts for education, either public or private, were 
wholly omitted. Upon the return of peace and the adjustment of 7 
affairs, both private and political, attention was once more directed to 
this.important subject. 
The earliest legislation in regard to public education occurring after 
the war will be found in an act for laying out the reserve land in the 
town of Augusta into acre lots, the erecting of an academy or seminary 
of learning, and for other purposes therein mentioned, assented to July 
31,1783.2 By the fourteenth section of this act, the Governor was em- 
powered to grant one thousand acres of land for a free school in each 
county. Under the same act provision was made for the establishment 
of a free school in the townof Washington, Wilkes County, and of two 
academies, one at Waynesborough, Burke County, and the other at Au- 
gusta, in the county of Richmond. Of. the academies the latter only 
deserves special consideration, partly from the fact of its longevity, it 
having from the beginning almost uninterruptedly naintained an active 
existence, but particularly on account of the historic memories which are 
connected with it. 
After reciting, ‘And whereas a seminary of learning is greatly nec- 
essary for the instruction of our youth, and ought to be one of the first 
objects of attention, after the promotion of religion,”® the act. directed 
the town commissioners to lay out the reserve land of Augusta into 
acre lots and sell them. With the moneys arising from such sales they

were, among other things, to erect an academy. This was the origin of 
what has since been known as the Academy of Richmond County. The 
~ school was regularly opened in 1785, and on the 25th of March of that 
year, we are told, “ Mr. William Rogers, late of the State of Maryland, 
having been well recommended as being of good fame and sufficiently 
learned in the sciences,” was appointed master of the academy, at a 
salary of two hundred pounds a year, with the use of the tenement 
buildings and the garden on the premises. He was required to teach 
the Latin, Greek, and English Janguages, and the common practical 
branches of mathematics. The tuition of the highest class of pupils 
was fixed at ten dollars per quarter. The master, as he was called, had 
the assistance of one, and afterward of two tutors.! 
Mr. Rogers was re-elected annually to the office of rector of the acad- 
emy until 1793. Three years later the Hon. William H. Crawford, who 
was afterward United States Senator from Georgia, minister to France 
under President Madison, and Secretary of War under President Mon- 
roe, became connected with the institution, serving two terms as Eng- 
lish teacher in the academy, and one in the capacity of rector, resigning 
the latter position in 1799. In 1826 James P. Waddell, subsequently a 
professor of ancient languages in the University of Georgia, assumed 
the control of the school, holding the rectorship during six successive 
terms. The present faculty of the academy consists of three teachers, 
its principal being a prominent graduate of the University of Virginia. 
The original trustees of the Academy of Richmond County were 
George Walton, Joseph Panuill, Andrew Burns, William Glascock, and 
Samuel Jack. The number was subsequently increased to seven, and 
then to nine, as at present. The office of president of the Board was 
created in 1788, William Glascock being the first incumbent. Since 
Mr. Glascock sixteen persons, including the one now serving, have suc- 
eessively filled the position. 
In 1790, Augusta still being the seat of government of Georgia, the 
building occupied by the academy, upon its tender by the trustees, was 
accepted and utilized for the transaction of the general business of the 
State. In May of the following year the acade.ay was honored by a 
visit from President Washington, who, in his tour through the States, 
had stopped at Augusta. The General expressed himself highly pleased 
with the condition and conduct of the institution, and complimented 
the teachers upon the fine appearance of their pupils. In 1815 a branch 
school was located and organized on the Sand Hills, near Augusta, 
which for many years subserved the purposes of a preparatory depart- 
ment for the academy. 
The academy continued in successful operation until the latter part of 
the Civil War, when it was used by the Confederate authorities as a hos- 
pital. It was occupied by United States troops for a year or more after 
the termination of hostilities, and was then restored to its trustees, who,

through the active and efficient intervention of Gen. George W. Rains, 
as regent, succeeded in reopening it on the Lst of January, 1868. Since 
that time the institution has been regular in its exercises, averaging 
annually from eighty to ninety pupils. The session of 1882-83, which 
concluded with a centennial. celebration of the academy, was among 
the most prosperous of its existence. There were in attendance that 
year over one hundred pupils. 
The present academical structure, situated in the midst of an ample 
grove of trees, was completed in 1802 ata cost of fifteen or. twenty 
thousand dollars. Prior to this time the academy classes were in- 
structed in a building specially rented for that purpose. 
The Academy of Richmond County is well endowed for an institution 
of its sort, having funds sufficient to meet all current expenses and add 
not less than one thousand dollars per annum to its endowment fund.t 
SUNBURY ACADEMY. 
The legislation of the next two years (viz, 1784 and 1785), education- 
ally considered, had reference to the establishment of the University of 
Georgia, and will not, therefore, concern us until we come to speak of 
the colleges; so we pass on to February 1, 1788, 2 date memorable at 
least for the foundation of two academies, one at Sunbury, in Liberty 
County, and the other at Savannah, in Chatham County. The only re- 
marks which need be made in connection with the Chatham Academy 
are that, by the act incorporating it, vacant land, not to exceed in quan- 
tity five thousand acres, was reserved for its use;? and that it was one 
of the beneficiaries at the sale of the Bethesda property in 1808, and 
received two-fifths of the proceeds.® 
The Academy at Sunbury‘ was, in an educational point of view, the 
e pluribus unum of its time; and when the act of February 1, 1788,° gave 
it “a local habitation and a name,” it soon rose to a high and influen- 
tial position among the schools of southern Georgia. Abiel Holmes, 
James Dunwody, John Elliott, Gideon Dowse, and Peter Winn were 
nominated in the act as commissioners. To them, or a majority of them, 
was authority given to sell at public sale, and upon previous notice of 
thirty days in one of the gazettes of the State, any confiscated property 
within the County of Liberty to the amount of one thousand pounds.’ 
1In his address before the Georgia Historical Society in 1845, Doctor Church said: 
“The Richmond Academy has buildings and library and apparatus worth probably 
$30,000, an annuity from real estate amounting to $1,600, and bank stock to the 
amount of $12,000, besides lands which are rapidly increasing in value.” (White’s 
Statistics of Georgia, p. 71.)

°This authority to sell confiscated property was. so far as records show, conferred 
then for the first time; nor did the granting of it become general in the State until 
some years later,

This sum, when realized, was to be by them expended in the construc- 
tion of a building suitable for the purposes of the academy. 
The fair fame of Sunbury Academy is lastingly associated with the 
name of Rev. William MeWhir, under whose able and energetic man- 
agement it passed through its most successful period. This teacher, 
writes Colonel Jones,! “did more than all others to establish a standard 
of scholarship and maintain rules of study and discipline unusual in 
that period and among those peoples. * * * Great was the obliga- 
tion conferred upon the youths of southern Georgia, for certainly two 
generations, by this competent instructor and rigid disciplinarian.” A 
native of Ireland, a graduate of Belfast College, and licensed to preach 
by the Presbytery of that city, he came to America in 1783 and settled 
in Alexandria, Va. There, for ten years, he was the principal of the 
academy of which General Washington was a trustee. Removing to 
Sunbury about 1793, he took charge of the academy, and, for nearly 
thirty years, made it the leading institution of learning in that entire 
region. Besides the Latin, Greek, and English departments, with which . 
Doctor McWhir was thoroughly conversant, the higher branches of 
mathematics were also taught; and, as a preparatory school, Sunbury 
Academy, under his guidance, had no superior within the limits of the 
State. The average attendance was about seventy. Pupils were at- 
tracted not only from Liberty, but also from the adjacent counties of 
Chatham, Bryan, McIntosh, and Glynn. Some came from even greater 
distances. 
The school-house—a large two-story-and-a-half double wooden build- 
ing, about sixty feet square, and located in King’s Square—was pulled 
down and sold some time about the year 1842. 
Sunbury Academy has itself passed away; but not without leaving 
an influence on Georgia’s educational progress which the State will 
always gratefully recognize. 
OTHER ACADEMIES, 
The second Constitution of Georgia, which was adopted in 1789, con- 
tained no specific grants in respect to education. Three years later, 
however, in December, 1792,’ we find an act authorizing the commis- 
sioners of the county academies to purchase one thousand pounds’ value 
of confiscated property for the use and support of their respective in- 
stitutions. Similar provisions were made in 1802° and in 1810,‘ and 
were designed to cover all cases where the commissioners had not as 
yet received their portion. By the act of February 22, 1796,° an academy 
was established at Louisville, in Jefferson County. This and the acad- 
emies already erected at Augusta, Waynesborough, Savannali, Bruns-

wick (Glynn County),! and Sunbury, were all, so far as the writer has 
been able to discover,’ which had been incorporated in the State prior 
to the present century. 
At this stage of our subject it may be well to quote the ample pro- 
vision contained in Article IV, Section 13, of the third Constitution of 
Georgia,—that of 1798:° : ; 
“The arts and sciences shail be promoted in one or more seminaries 
of learning, and the Legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, 
give such further donations and privileges to those already established, 
as may be necessary to secure the objects of their institution ; and it 
shall be the duty of the General Assembly, at their next session, to pro- 
vide effectual measures for the improvement and permanent security of 
the funds and endowments of such institutions.” 
Truthfully, and with even greater force, does Doctor Church’s ob- 
servation in regard to the Constitution of 1777 apply to the Constitu- 
tion of 1798; for, had the broad-minded views which found expression in 
the latter been fully carried out, ‘‘ Georgia would now have a system of 
education equal, if not superior, to that of any State in the Union.”* 
In 1802, as has been seen, the General Assembly re-enacted the pro- 
vision respecting the privilege of “claiming a credit of £1,000” at the 
sales of confiscated lands which had previously® been accorded to the 
commissioners of county academies. The first institutions to avail them- 
selves of the benefits of this legislation were the Academies of Greene 
County and Washington County, which were established about 1803.° 
They were followed by Oglethorpe Academy, the name of which was 
shortly after its foundation’ changed to Meson Academy. Effingham 
Academy was the next in order, being incorporated in 1809;° and in 1810° 
Mt. Enon Academy was chartered, which had been in operation since

tion of the moneys arising from the sale of acre lots in the town of Washington, 
Wilkes County, which was intended, under the act of July 31, 1783, to be applied to 
the erection and equipment of a free school there, had been utilized in the establish- 
ment of an academy, and that the same had been duly organized, and the services of 
teachers engaged. See also act of December 12, 1804 (Clayton’s Digest, p. 213), by 
which the commissioners of the institution above alluded to were authorized to inau- 
gurate a lottery for the purpose of raising two thousand dollars toward finishing the 
academy and purchasing literary apparatus for it.

1806.1. The year 1811? gave birth to the Mount Zion and Powellton 
Academies, both of them in Hancock County. The former enjoyed an 
enviable reputation for many years. They were subsequently imecor- 
porated, Powellton Academy in 1815,4 and Mt. Zion Academy in 1823.5 
In December, 1815,° the Sand Hills Academy was founded. It was a 
branch school to the Academy of Richmond County until 1866, when 
it became an independent organization. 
In 1816 Eatonton Academy, in Putnam County, was established, and 
for its support the funds and property formerly belonging to the Union 
Academy’ were transferred to its trustees. Two years afterward Sparta 
Academy, in Hancock County, and academies in Jackson and Jasper 
Counties were incorporated. In 1819 the Washington County Academy 
received a charter, being then in the sixteenth year of its active exist- 
ence; and during the next twenty years the work of tle erection of 
academies in Georgia rapidly progressed. We are told by Mr, Evaus 
(History of Georgia, p. 206) that there were sixty-four academies in 
active operation in 1829; and that (p. 232) in 1840 academies had 
been built in the State to the number of one hundred and seventy- 
six, with an aggregate attendance of eight thousand pupils. These 
institutions of learning have grown with the growth of the State, and 
may now be found in every county and town in Georgia. A reference 
to pages 443-9 of the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 
1884-85 will show the names of some of the more recently established 
academies. 
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ACADEMIES. 
It may not seem improper, in this connection, to notice the Roman 
Catholic academies, which, while perhaps in some of their features as 
piring to a place among colleges, still, generally speaking, deserve to 
be classed with the institutions just alluded to, There are six principal 
academies of the Roman Catholic denomination in Georgia. Of these 
the first established was the Academy of St. Vincent de Paul, located 
at Savannah, and founded in 1845. It was incorporated in 1849, under 
the title of the Savannah Institute of the Sisters of Mercy, and enjoys 
the distinction of being not only the pioneer Catholic academy in the

3Rev. C. P. Beman, who afterward was president of Oglethorpe University, was 
for a considerable period in successful and efficient management of this institution.

cipal, with the Mount Zion Academy.

State, but also the parent of three out of the five Catholic academies of 
high rank which have sivce arisen. I refer to the St. Mary’s Academy 
and the Sacred Heart Academy at Augusta, and the Academy of the 
Immaculate Conception in Atlanta, the respective dates of their founda- 
tion being 1853, 1876, and 1867. In 1876 an academy was started at 
Macon, by the name of Mt. De Sales Academy. All these academies 
were organized and conducted by the Sisters of Mercy, but the last was 
founded by a distinct branch of that order and independently of the 
rest. 
We conclude with St. Joseph’s Academy, situated at Washington, 
Wilkes County, and under the direction of the Sisters of St. Joseph. 
This academy was likewise established in 1876, but did not receive its 
charter until 1878. Although it professes to have the right of granting 
diplomas, and conferring all degrees peculiar to female colleges in the 
State of Georgia, and has what it terms a collegiate department in ad- 
dition to the elementary and preparatory departments, the course of 
study pursued there does not appear to materially differ from, or to be 
in any way superior to, the curricula in the other academies. It consists, 
in the case of the graduating classes, of Christian doctrine, trigonom- 
etry, English literature, mythology, geology, astronomy, logic, and moral 
philosophy. 
A department of music is embraced in each of these schools, and 
special emphasis is laid upon this feature of the instruction. The 
academies are well attended, and offer good advantages. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
So much for what Georgia has accomplished in the way of academi- 
cal instruction. The important influence which her academies exerted 
in the earlier periods of her history cannot be questioned, nor can it be 
doubted that the academies were largely instrumental in laying, broad 
and deep, the foundations upon which the system of colleges and uni- 
versities was subsequently to rest. Let us remember, however, that the 
facilities for education, as afforded in academies, were not accessible to 
all. Many there were who lived far beyond the reach of the towns and 
cities, where the majority of those institutions were located; under such 
circumstances recourse was had to the elementary schools, in which 
they found their only source of educational supply. In these schools 
the simplest elements of learning, viz, spelling, reading, penmanship, 
arithmetic, and sometimes English grammar and geography, were 
taught; and they were, Doctor Orr tells us, the sole reliance throughout 
the rural districts of the State for many years. We are indebted to 
him for the following account! of the general plan upon which these 
elementary schools were conducted : 
“The men who taught them were often incompetent—being sometimes

  24 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
without natural capacity, attainments, or aspirations—and now and 
then even persons of bad morals. There were among them no teach- 
ers’ institutes or associations, no circulating libraries, no educational 
periodicals—in short, nothing approaching the modern appliances pro- 
vided with a view to professional elevation. There was no examination 
of teachers, no issuing of license as a condition precedent to obtaining 
aschool, and no supervision. Every teacher was isolated, entirely de- 
pendent upon his own ability to modify methods or originate better 
ones, and completely and absolutely independent in the little realm 
ever which he held sway. The obtaining of a school was entirely a mat- 
ter of contract between himself as teacher and his proposed patrons. 
The latter were often utterly incompetent to judge of the teacher’s 
qualifications, and hinged their acceptance or rejection of him solely 
upon the rates at which he offered his services. A vivid picture of one 
of the more harmless of this class of ‘old field school-masters,’ as they 
were called, is drawn in the person of Michael St. John, in the Georgia 
Scenes, a book of infinite humor, written by my venerated and revered 
preceptor, Hon. Augustus B. Longstreet; while a type of the more 
brutal class is given us in the character of israel Meadows, of the cele- 
brated Philemon Perch Papers, of which Col. Richard M. Johnston, 
now of Pen Lucy Academy, near Baltimore, is the author.” 
THE POOR SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
The next subject we will consider is the poor school system, in re- 
gard to which it has been said,! that this “ so-called system had no sys- 
tem in it, that it was full of defects, and that it was lacking in a hun- 
dred of the elements that make up an efficient public school system.” 
Nevertheless “it answered a valuable purpose initsday. It placed the 
elements of an imperfect English education within reach of the entire 
white population, among whom the means of comfortable support were 
so general as to be well-nigh universal.” 
ORIGIN OF THE SYSTEM. 
This system? took its rise in the act of July 31,1783. By the four- 
teenth section of that act, and in pursuance of a provision therein made 
respecting the erection of a free school in the town of Washington, 
Wilkes County, the Governor, upon proper application, was empowered 
to grant one thousand acres of vacant land for the establishment of free 
schools in the several counties of the Sta Here was the beginning of

  the poor school system in Georgia, although it was not thoroughly 
inaugurated, aad nodecided action was taken until December 18, 1817, 
when an act was passed to create and establish a fund for the support 
of free schools throughout the State,! and an appropriation of two hun- 
dred-and fifty thousand dollars was made for that purpose. By an act 
for the “‘ permanent endowment of county academies, and to increase 
the funds heretofore set apart for the encouragement and support of 
free schools, and for the internal improvement of the State,”® approved 
December 21, 1821, the General Assembly provided for the division of 
five hundred thousand dollars equally between the academies and free 
schools. Hence originated the distinction which so long obtained in 
Georgia between the Academic and the Poor School Funds. Under the 
act of December 22, 1823,° provision was made for the investment of the 
latter fund, and the distribution of the annual income, amounting to 
between twenty and thirty thousand dollars, among the counties in 
proportion to their white population, for the education of the poor 
children, and in payment for their tuition. An act of the preceding 
year had specified what persons should be the beneficiaries of the fand.* 
“Tt was not,” we are told, ‘‘ the policy to establish separate schools for 
these indigent children. Such teachers of the academies and of the 
inferior or elementary schools as were willing to submit tu an exami- 
nation, which was often a mere matter of form and conducted by incom- 
petent examiners, were entitled, if approved, to receive their pro rata 
of the public fund for teaching any children adjudged by certain magis- 
trates as belonging to the class known as ‘poor scholars,’ who may 
have entered their schools.”®

education of the poor, assented to 27th of December, 1843 (in which it was.declared 
that, in order to be received and educated, the poor children must be betsveen the 
ages of eight and sixteen years); provided that the children to be returned to the 
JAnferior courts by the justices of the peace, or other persons in the several militia 
districts, should be between the ages of six and sixteen years, and that the poor chil- 
dren to be reported by the just of the inferior court of each county to His E 
lency, the Governor, should be between the ages of six and sixteen years. (Act of

day, to be paid by the county.” According to Mr. Lewis’s Report on Publie Educa- 
tion, which was published in 1860, the whole number of poor children then in Geor, 
was safely estimated at from forty to fifty thousand—about one-third of all the chil- 
dren in the State between the ages of six and sixteen, the whole number of the latter 
being, by computation, something over one hundred and forty thousand.

  26 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
By an act of December 23, 1836, one-third of the surplus revenue, 
amounting to three hundred and. fifty thousand dollars, was set apart 
“as “a permanent free school and education fund,” and a joint com- 
mittee of five, two from the Senate and three from the House of Repre- 
sentatives, was appointed, whose duty it was “to digest a plan of 
common school education best adapted to the genius, habits of life and 
of thought, of the people of Georgia,” and two of whom were author- 
ized to visit, during the ensuing year, different parts of the United 
States, and particularly the New England States, ascertain the opera- 
tion of their several school systems, and report to the General Assem- 
bly at its next session a plan of common schools. They were also 
empowered to “institute a correspondence with such persons as they 
might think proper, either in the United States or Europe, or both, for 
the purpose of getting information of some of the different systems of 
common school edue ation which likewise prevail in some of the Euro- 
pean countries.” ! 
They fulfilled their mission. The report, as submitted by the com- 
mittee, while objecting to the moral and social tendency of the manual 
labor system considered as a systemof general education to he adopted 
and followed by the Government, as well as to the general application 
of the Laveleyean plan of instruction, recommended the adoption of a 
system not unlike that in vogue in the Eastern and Middle States. It 
assumed, above all, as a leading principle, that the good of the com- 
munity required that the rich and the poor should be educated together 
at common schools. It was farther stated, as the result of investiga- 
tion, that out of eighty-three thousand children in the State, only twenty- 
five thousand of that number were in attendance upon schools.” 
The Legislature amended and modified’ this report, and in 1837 passed 
an act establishing a general system of education by common schools,’ to 
take effect in 1839. By that act the academic and poor school funds 
were consolidated ; and, together with the interest on one-third part of 
the surplus revenue, were constituted “a general fund for common 
schools.” In the following year this act was modified in some of its 
provisions, and the inferior courts (at their discretion), on the recom- 
mendation of the grand jury, were authorized to levy an extra tax in 
their respective counties, not exceeding fifty per cent. on the general tax. 
The amount thus raised was to be added to the common school fund.‘ 
REPEAL OF THE ACTS PROVIDING FOR A COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
In 1840 the acts of 1537 and 1838, establishing a system of common 
schools, were repealed, and the funds for their support were set apart 
a8 a poor school fund.’ This legislative act was amended in 1843, and

the inferior courts were authorized to raise by an extra tax an amount 
sufficient, when added to the pro rata distribution from the State, to 
educate the poor children in their respective counties.) The leading: 
provision of the law establishing the poor school system made it the 
duty of the magistrates in the districts to report to the iuferior court, an- 
nually, the names of all the children in their respective districts deemed 
by them proper persons to receive a portion of the fund set apart for 
the education of the poor. These retarns were sent by the inferior 
court to the “executive office,” and formed the basis for the distribution 
of the fund, which amounted to about twenty thousand dollars.” 
.OBJECTIONS TO THE POOR SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
This duty of the magistrates, under the law, to make returns of the 
poor children, was often entirely neglected. Even when made these re- 
turns were very imperfect. Not more than three-fourths of the poor 
children in the State were returned, and of those returned (as was 
learned from commissioners of the poor school fund in a few counties), 
little more than half were sent to school, and those who went did not 
attend four months in the year. In 1849 thirty-two counties made no 
returns of their poor children. In 1850 fifteen counties failed to make 
returns; and notwithstanding the law provided that counties making no 
returns should participate in the educational fund agreeably to the last 
return on record,’ in the same year eight counties received nothing 
because they had never made a return.‘ In further illustration of the 
general indifference then felt on the subject of poor schools, we quote 
from Governor George W. Crawford’s message of 1845. He says that 
“during the past year [viz, 1844] only fifty-three of the ninety-three 
counties of the State made application at the treasury for their allot- 
ments of the poor school fund,” and when, too, the penalty for default 
was known to be an absolute forfeiture of claim ® 
Another objection to the poor school plan were its gross injustice to 
the poorer counties, where there were the greatest number of poor chil- 
dren and the least ability to bear taxation. For instance, the counties 
of Newton and Jasper paid into the treasury, as State tax, $3,910, and 
returned some 120 poor children; whilst those of Union and Gilmer, 
which paid a State tax of $1,594, returned 2,884 poor children.®

annually distributed for this purpose.”

existed in 1869:1! “Under the laws now in force,” he writes, “a board 
of education in each county, consisting of the Ordinary, as ex-officio 
- treasurer of the poor school fund, and a commissioner appointed by the 
judge of the superior court, issues license to almost any person, author- 
izing said person to teach when, where, and how he or she may please. 
As a general rule, the teacher provides his own school-room and school 
furniture (of the most primitive kind), and is allowed seven cents a day 
for each pupil in actual attendance; he files his account with the Ordi- 
nary quarterly, and receives compensation at the expiration of the year. 
* * * No argument is necessary to prove that the absolute effect 
of this system is to transform the State schools from common schools 
(such as the people wish) into the veriest pauper or ‘poor schools,’ as 
they are termed. The law-making power seems all the while to have 
been laboring under the impression that the children in our State be- 
long to. two classes—regarding the one as belonging to rich families, 
and the other as paupers. This is a mistake, though measurably ad- 
hered to still. We have made these schools mere charities. * * * 
The ‘poor schools’ of this State, by reason of the law which creates 
them, are robbed of the influence for good that they might otherwise 
wield, The very law subjects every patron of these schools to the jeer 
of pauperism.” 
In the same spirit had Governor William Schley selina: as far back 
as 1837. In referring to the distinction as made by the General Assem- 
bly of academic and poor school funds, he remarked: “ There should be 
no such designations as academic aud poor school, because they are in- 
vidious and insulting. Poverty, though a great inconvenience, is no 
crime; and it is highly improper, whilst you offer to aid the cause of 
education, to say to a portion of the people, ‘ You are poor’ Thousands 
of freemen who, though indigent, are honest, patriotic, and valuable 
citizens, will refuse your bounty and despise the hand that offers it, be- 
cause it is accompanied with insult.”? 
The truth of Governor Schley’s observation was abundantly confirmed 
by the results which everywhere attended the workings of the poor 
school system, Weare told by Kiddle and Schem® that in 1850 there 
were in Georgia 213,903 white adults, of whom twenty per cent. were 
unable to read and write; and a reference to the United States Census 
of 1860, when the number of illiterates had been reduced to eighteen 
per cent., shows that there were then in the State 16,900 males and 
26,784 females (white) over twenty-one years of age, ignorant of even 
the simplest rudiments of learning. 
Amply had it been demonstrated that the poor school system in its 
then state was wholly inadequate to meet the educational demands which 
it was designed to supply. Clearly apparent it was that a reform in

its methods was greatly needed, and that a system was wanted which, 
in the language of Thomas RK. R. Cobb, “ should remedy these defects, 
avoiding others: schools to which the children of the poorest citizens 
might be sent without submitting parent or child to the jeer of pauper- 
ism: school-houses which should awaken a feeling of pride in every 
neighborhood,! and cause the richest to feel that no private teaching 
can afford equal advantages to the common schools.” 
For a correct understanding of the difficulties inherent in and the 
reason for the failure of the poor school plan, it must be remembered 
that, previous to the Civil War, the people of Georgia looked to pri- 
vate or independent schools for the education of their sous and daugh- 
ters. The system of education adopted and attempted by the State 
contemplated that provision should be made for the instruction of in- 
digent white children in the elementary branches of an English educa- 
tion. The question of the cost of tuition in private schools was not con- 
sidered. The stand-point from which the people viewed the subject 
rendered the consideration of that item entirely unnecessary. The 
means were at hand, and the people cheerfully used them. Public sen- 
timent, as a rule, was against the suggestion that it was the province 
and duty of the State to educate her youth. It was coneeded, how- 
ever, that the State might, with measurable propriety, provide for the 
intellectual training of children whose parents were too poor to pay tui- 
tion in the independent schools.2. To this end it was that poor schools 
were established; and had that fatal error which was the spirit and 
leading idea of the theory upon which the system was based from its 
inception to its abolition—I mean the condition of panperism, which 
was an inseparable incident to a participation in its benefits—been 
thoroughly eradicated, there can be no doubt that the system would 
have proved a most wholesome institution, and one productive of con- 
siderable good for the indigent classes. 
  
'In speaking of the poor schools, Mr. Calvin says (Popular Edueation in Georgia, 
p. 7): ‘*They [poor schools] are never visited. They are generally uccounted 
‘Hedge Schools,’ and so denominated, secretly and openly.”

CHAPTER, III. 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
That there was no regularly organized system of common schools sup- 
ported by public taxation in Georgia prior to the Civil War has been 
already shown. Of the attempts toward the establishment of such a 
system we are now to speak Efforts were made in 1845 and again in 
1856 to inaugurate a common school system in the State, both of which 
were unsuccessful. Still it was evident that the people of Georgia were 
beginning to feel the need, and were expecting the erection of public, 
or free schools. They took their first step in that direction when, on 
December 11, 1858, the Legislature set apart one hundred thousand 
dollars annually of the net earnings of the Western and Atlantic Rail- 
road (State property) for educational purposes; and provided that, upon 
the payment of any portion of the public debt of the State by means of 
the sinking fund, bonds of the State to a like amount should be executed 
by the Governor and deposited with the Secretary of State, who should 
hold them as trustee of the educational fund, the interest thereon at six 
per cent. to be appropriated to school purposes.”

were to receive the benefics of education from this source should be between six and 
eighteen years (Laws of 1859, pp. 29-30).

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 31 
These measures contemplated the realization at no distant day of a 
fund sufficient to establish free schools throughout the State. This an- 
ticipation would probably have been realized but for the Civil War. 
The provisions of the law went so far as to allow the people of any 
county to establish free schools and use their share of the funds for 
this purpose; and, in 1860, in one county (Forsyth) free schools were 
established and successfully carried on. 
The public school system, a8 now known in Georgia, sprang up after 
the War, and was essentially an outgrowth of the many changes effected. 
by it. “ Most of the States in the South,” says Doctor Orr, “ in adopt- 
ing new constitutions under the reconstruction acts, incorporated into 
the fundamental law the public school policy. * * * Not only were 
constitutions which provide for public education generally adopted, but 
in every State in the South the attempt has been made to inaugurate a 
school system under laws passed in accordance with the new constitu- 
tional requirements.” 
Georgia formed no exception to this rule. In her Constitution of 1868 
she provided for “‘a thorough system of general education to be forever 
free to all children of the State.”? Two years later, in October, 1870, 
the first public school law was enacted; and it is an interesting fact in 
connection with that law that its main provisions were identical with a 
plan submitted to the Legislature by the 
FIRST STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
This body, in the month of August, 1869, held its first annual meet- 
ing, as a regular organization, in the city of Atlanta. A committee 
was raised to report upon aschool system adapted to the condition and 
wants of Georgia. This report was to be submitted, first to the execu- 
tive committee of the Association, and, after revision by its members, 
to the Association itself, at a special session to be held in the following 
November at Macon. Some changes were made in the committee after 
its first appointment, and it finally stood as follows: Gustavus J. Orr, 
the late respected State School Commissioner, chairman ; the late Ber- 
nard Mallon, for many years superintendent of the schools of Atlanta ; 
the late John M. Bonnell, at that time president of the Wesleyan Fe- 
male College; Martin V. Calvin, a Representative in the Legislature from 
Richmond County; and David W. Lewis, late President of the North 
Georgia Agricultural College at Dahlonega. 
A meeting of the committee was held, and each member having fully 
given his views,’ Doctor Orr was directed to write the report. When

3It is noteworthy that Mr. Calvin had read a paper (Popular Education in Geor- 
gia, ete.) before the Georgia Teachers’ Association, at its meeting in Angust, 1869, 
which, after discussion, had been referred to a committee of five as above stated, 
who were instructed to report a system of common schools for the State; and that

he had performed this duty, his work was submitted:to the exeeutive 
committee, consisting of the Rey. Dr. H. H. Tueker, Prof. LeRoy Broun, 
the late Dr, Alexander Means, Prof. W. D. Williams, the late Dr. 
J. M. Bonnell, the late Mr. Mallon, and Doctor Orr himself, the last 
three being members of both committees. The report was read, and 
nine hours were spent in discussing it, section by seetion. The result 
of this careful examination was the adoption of the report as it was 
written. Another full discussion was had before the State Teachers’ 
Association, that body devoting an entire day to the subject. A few 
slight alterations were made, and the report was unanimously adopted. 
The Association then appointed a committee, composed of the Rev. 
Dr. H. H. Tueker, Col. D. W. Lewis, Dr. G. J. Orr, Mr. B. Mallon, and 
Hon. David E. Butler, to put the report in the shape of a bill, and urge 
the same upon the attention of the Legislature. Before the assembling 
of that body reconstruction was reconstructed, and many members were 
unseated and others substituted, by military orders, in their stead. 
Under the circumstances, the committee last raised thought it best not 
to be personally present when the Legislature convened, all coneurring 
in this opinion, As the session advanced, however, Doctor Orr de- 
cided to see what could be done through two personal friends, the Hon. 
I. E. Shumate, Representative from the county of Whitfield, and the 
Hon. Council B. Wooten, Senator from the Eleventh District. Mr. 
Mallon, through personal friends in the body, co-operated. The result 
was that the plan of the Georgia Teachers’ Association was laid before 
the Committee on Education of the House and Senate, and a bill was 
framed and became a taw, following in its main provisions the system 
mapped out in the report, so carefully prepared, so critically examined, 
and so peers Pegs by the educators of Georgia. 
the views eed in this paper were indorsed and incorporated in that report. Mr. 
Calvin, among other things, adverted to the necessity of establishing graded schools, 
and a State normal school, or schools, ‘‘ where we can train our own teachers.” He 
is said to have been the first to suggest the education of the colored.as well as the 
white population. ‘‘ Let the system be common to all,” he writes, ‘‘ but require their 
schools to be separate from those of the whites in fact and locality. Set apart 
the colored poll-tax, and the tax on their property tothe support of their schools ; 
and to the same end let the people add such sums as they may feel able to donate.” 
He also-advised the setting apart and application of one-half of the three hundred 
thousand dollars annually accruing from the State road for the support of common 
schools, the amount to be judiciously and promptly distributed among the different 
counties. Hon. William H. Stiles, of Chatham, had struck the key-note regarding 
normal schools many years before. Ina speech delivered in the House of Representa- 
tives, January 29, 1856, he pointed out Georgia’s standing as to rate’ of illiteracy as 
being the twenty-third in the Union, there being only four more illiterate States than 
herself, and urged the establishment of normal schools. He introduced a bill, the 
first section of which was: “That for the arrangement, supervision, and improve- 
ment of such schools as may be supported in any manner out of appropriations from 
the treasury of the State, or out of taxes specifically levied upon the cownties fer the 
purposes of education, th» Governor shall appoint a Commissioner of Public Schools 
who shall hold his office tor two years.” This point the speaker emphasized.
-P-A-G-E-35
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 33 
The first changes made in the law were in January, 1872, these 
changes being brought about by a memorial from the same body as that 
from which the first plan emanated. The main effect of the alterations 
thus made was to cause the views of the Association, as embodied in 
their report, to be more closely followed than they had been in the first 
act. Much credit for the changes made at this time is due to Hon. 
Henry Jackson, then a Representative from Fulton County. 
Under the act of October 13, 1870,1 an organization was effected. 
Gen. J. 8. Lewis was appointed State School Commissioner by Gover- 
nor Bullock, and entered upon the duties of his office. Schools were 
very generally put in operation; but, as the Legislature had diverted 
the school fund to other purposes, when the schools closed there were 
no funds to pay a debt of about three hundred thousand dollars to 
school officers and teachers. This deficiency arose in part from the 
failure to collect the poll-tax during the years 1868, 1869, and 1870.7 
When there occurred a change in the administration of the State, 
General Lewis having resigned, Governor Smith sent into the Senate as 
one of his two first appointees—the other being Chief-Justice Warner— 
the name of Gustavus J. Orr to be State School Commissioner. He was 
promptly confirmed by the Senate. This was in January, 1872, and he 
continued to occupy the position to which he was then appointed until 
the 13th of December, 1887, when death removed him from the dis- 
charge of his important and useful functions. On all occasions he 
manifested an interest in the welfare and advancement of public school 
education which can not be too highly commended. Almost his first 
official act was to direct school officers to make no efforts to establish 
public schools during the year 1872. This suspension was owing to the 
confusion in the school finances and the lack of confidence on the na 
of the people because of the unpaid debt of 1871. 
At the summer session in 1872, upon the recommendation of the State 
School Commissioner, an act was passed to raise money to discharge 
this indebtedness. A large sum was raised and expended, and it is 
now well ascertained that under the provisions of this and of subsequent 
acts on the subject‘ all, or very nearly all, valid claims have long since 
been settled. 
At the request of Judge William M. Reese, Senator from the Twenty- 
ninth District, a bill was prepared by the State School Commissioner 
to “perfect the Bue school system and to pSaDOISOUy existing school 
Ni act to pseu h a ei of public instruction. (Laws of 1870, pp. 194 SL.) 
2 See also the act of October 25, 1870, which declared the collection of the poll-tax 
for those years illegal. (Zbid., pp. 66-7, and Derry’s Georgia, p. 110.) 
3“An act to provide for the payment of the debt due to teachers and school officers 
who did service under the public school Jaw in the year 1871,” approved August 19, 
1872. (Laws of 1872, p. 62.) 
4See especially ‘An act to provide for the payment of the claims of school officers 
and teachers for services rendered in the year 1871,” approved March 3, 1874. (Laws 
of 1874, p, 30.)

laws.”' This bill was introduced into the Senate by Judge Reese in 
the summer of 1872, and was ably championed by him. It passed both 
branches of the Tasbleiice: and practically? remains the general 
school law of the State. 
It would be tedious to follow in detail all the legislation which has 
obtained since 1872. Many minor changes have been made, some of 
which were tried for a while and then repealed. Others still stand. 
Some of these changes have been wise and salutary. Several deter- 
mined efforts have been made, from time to time, by the opponents 
of public schools to overturn the system, but on every occasion able 
defenders have arisen who have battled for and perpetuated its exist- 
ence. The most signal triumph of its friends was when the Constitu- 
tion of 1877 placed in the fundamental law the provision that there 
should be “a thorough system of common schools.” ? 
SOURCES OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL FUND. 
The public school fund is derived from the following sources: The 
poll-tax, one-half the rental of the Western and Atlantic Railroad (one 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars), a tax on shows and exhibitions, a 
tax upon dealers in spirituous and malt liquors, the net proceeds of the 
hire of convicts, the net proceeds of the fees for the inspection of fer- 
tilizers, and certain other sources of minor importance. A direct prop- 
erty tax for the support of schools, though specifically authorized bot 
by the Constitution of 1868 and that of 1877, and though often pro- 
posed, has never been levied.’ The school fund has increased gradu- 
ally but surely, gaining little by little, and, like the mechanical power 
known as the screw, never losing anything once gained. In 1873 the 
total school fund was two hundred and fifty thousand dollars; in 1874, 
two hundred and sixty-five thousand. Year by year it has been grow- 
ing, until, in 1887, we find the grand total of this fund to be $795,987.5 
The fund and the number who have come forward to participate in

2“An act to amend, revise, and consolidate the common school laws of the State of 
Georgia, and for other purposes,” better known as the Denny Bill, was approved by 
the General Assembly October 27, 1887 (Laws of 1887, pp. 68-83); but the changes 
which it introduces in the excellent provisions framed by Doctor Orr are so incon- 
siderable that no further allusion need be made to it, other than to state that its 
principal features may be found summarized in the Report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1886-87, pp. 126-7. 
* Art. VII, sec. 1, par. 1. (Code of Georgia, 1882, p. 1321.) 
4Such, however, is now no longer the case. Since the above was written a new 
state of things has supervened. The Legislature of Georgia, at its present session 
(1888-89), passed an act providing for the levy of a general property tax of $165,000 
for the current year (1889), and $330,000 for the year next ensuing, for the support of 
the common schools of the State. 
® This includes the $302,478 which constituted for that year the school fund of the 
yarious cities and counties in the State under local laws,

its benefits have increased with even pace. The early beginnings were 
small. In 1871 there were enrolled in the schools 42,914 white and 
6,664 colored children, It was for the tuition of these that the large 
debt of three hundred thousand dollars was contracted. No debt has 
been allowed to be contracted since that date. In 1872, as before stated, 
there were no public schools. 
In the early summer of 1873 the State School Commissioner assem- 
bled at Atlanta the county commissioners of the State in convention. ° 
This meeting was of great importance. Much enthusiasm was aroused ; 
and, as the school finances were on a better basis than atvany previous 
time, the commissioners returned to their respective counties resolved 
to inaugurate at once public schools. Right wel! were their resolutions 
carried out.

@No public schools were put in operation in 1872. 
b The report of average attendance for 1879 was not full. 
Thus will it be seen that there has never been aretrogression, either 
in the total number in attendance! or in the number of white scholars.

The only falling off in attendance on the part of the colored pupils was 
in the single year 1884, there having been 1,593 more colored children 
in the public schools iu 1883 than in 1884, 
Let us now compare the attendance in 1873 with that in 1885. We find 
that in the former year there were 63,922 white children and 19,755 col- 
ored, or a total of 83,677 in the schools; in the latter year there were 
190,346 white, and 119,248 colored pupils, making a total of 309,594 in 
attendance. From this we may see that the attendance has been in the 
case of white children 126,424 beyond what it was in 1873, and in the 
ease of colored children an increase will be noted of 99,493; giving an 
aggregate increase of 225,917. 
SPECIAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Side by side with this general school system, established and made 
operative throughout the State by the school law of 1870, have grown 
up special school systems, regulated and controlled by local laws. 
Chatham County led the way, and was the first to have a separate sys- 
tem of her own.t| She was shortly followed by Columbus.2 This was 
in 1866, and antedated the passage of the first general public school 
Jaw. Atlanta came next in order, her system being formed in 1870.3 
Richmond and Bibb Counties inaugurated their systems in 1872,‘ and 
Glynn County her system in 1873.5 In 1884, in addition to those just 
named, local laws and organized schools existed in Americus® (Sam- 
ter County), West Point’ (Troup County), and Sandersville® (Washing- 
ton County), these systems having been developed through special laws 
enacted from time to time. In 1881° public schools were organized in 
Rome, and a system was inaugurated for the city of Griffin! (Spalding 
County) three years later. Of the thirty or more counties which now 
enjoy the privileges of special school systems, the more prominent are 
Richmond, Chatham (Savannah), Bibb, Clarke (Athens)," Floyd 
(Rome), Fulton (Atlanta), and Muscogee (Columbus).

THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 37 
THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The main features of the public school system were thus outlined by 
Doctor Orr in his address on the Best School System for a Southern 
State (pp. 11-13) : 
“1. The Constitution of the State provides that there shall be a 
thorough system of common schools for the education of children in the 
elementary branches of an English education only, the expenses of 
which shall be provided for by taxation or otherwise.! The same lim- 
itation which is thus put upon what the State may do educationally is 
also put upon what a county may do under authority from the State. 
No szch limitation is put upon what a municipal corporation may do 
by State authority. Hence many of our cities and towns are having 
a much wider range of studies taught, some of them having established 
good high schools for both sexes. The general school law of the State 
provides for teaching spelling, reading, writing, English grammar, 
geography, and arithmetic, which may be considered as a legislative in- 
terpretation of the words ‘elementary branches of an English educa- 
tion,’ though these words are clearly susceptible of a wider interpreta- 
tion. Our school law absolutely secures the continuance of public 
schools for the children of both races for three months of the year in 
every county of the State, and throughout the entire county. 
“2, Both the Constitution and the school law provide that separate 
schools shall be established for the children of the white and colored 
races, 
“3. Our law creates a State Board of Education, composed of the 
Governor, the Secretary of State, the Attorney-General, the Comp- 
troller-General, and the State School Commissioner. This board is a 
body corporate and can hold property. It isan advisory body, to whom 
the State School Commissioner may apply for counsel when in doubt as 
to official duty. It isalsothe high court of appeals in school matters, 
its decision either between parties litigant, or upon questions involving 
the construction or administration of the school law, being final. 
“4, Wealso have a State School Commissioner, who is appointed by the 
Governor and confirmed by the Senate. He is required to prescribe all 
the forms used by the subordinate school officers, to visit the counties 
as often as practicable, for the purpose of inspecting school operations 
and delivering public addresses, to collect school statistics, to make a 
full report of school operations to the General Assembly, making, at the 
same time, such recommendations to them in reference to the school 
policy of the State as his judgment may approve, and to see to the 
proper administration of the school law throughout the State. He is 
also a judge, and sits as such to hear and determine appeals from the 
decision of County Boards on suits in controversy before them. From 
his decision, as has been stated, there is an appeal to the State Board. 
  
‘ Art. VII, sec. 1, par. 1. (Code of Georgia, 1882, p. 1521.)
-P-A-G-E-40
  38 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
“5, The law also provides for a County Board of Education, consist: 
ing of five members chosen by the Grand Jury. The term of office is four 
years; but the terms of the members are so arranged that there is a 
change in the constituents of the board every two years, three new mem- 
bers coming in at the time of one change, and two at the time of the 
next. It is the duty of this board to locate schools, to employ teachers, 
to pass upon all accounts, and to direct all the school operations of the 
county. The board also sits as a court for trying all matters of school 
controversy. Noman is eligible to membership on this board unless 
he is a freeholder. 
“6, The County School Commissioner is the executive officer of the 
County Board, and is elected by that board. He examines teachers, 
executes the contract which the board makes with them, visits and in- 
spects schools, collects school statistics, and is the custodian of the 
school fund, receiving and paying out, when ordered by the board, all 
funds peed for school purposes. 
“7, The Board of Education also appoints three school trustees for 
each school district of the county. The principal duty of these trustees 
is to recommend teachers for the different schoois of their district. 
They are required to recommend, as teacher for each school, the person 
whom they believe to be the choice of the community, and the board is 
bound to employ this person, if he can stand a satisfactory examination 
and produce evidence of good moral character. 
“8, The Grand Jury also perform certain educational functions. 
They are themselves chosen under the Constitution from among ‘the 
most experienced, intelligent, upright men of the county.’ As has been 
seen, they elect the members of the County Board of Education. The 
County School Commissioner is required to make a full report to them, 
once a year, of the school operations of the county, and to place his 
books before them for examination; and they are required, in their 
general presentments, to take such notice of the management of the 
school interests of the county as they may think proper.” 
In conclusion may be quoted a statement made by Doctor Orr in the 
same address,' relative to the high repute in which the Georgia public 
school system is held, and the distinguished place which, by virtue of 
its excellence and efficiency, it occupies among kindred existing sys- 
tems of other States. “A few years ago,” he says, “I had the honor 
of being placed by the National Educational Association upon a com. 
mittee charged with the duty of reporting upon the best school system 
for a State. The chairman of the committee was the Hon. James II. 
Smart, who has been trusted by the State of Indiana, having held and 
filled with credit the highest educational positions in the gift of that 
State. The other member of the committee was the Hon. J. P. Wick- 
ersham, for sixteen years Superintendent of Public Instruction for the 
State of OTS lvania, @ man who ranks, and deservedly ranks, second

to no one among the educational thinkers and organizers of this conti- 
nent. After twelve months’ study of the systems of all the States, the 
ideal system, the system considered as the best and which was submit- 
ted as the best to the Association, followed very closely in its leading 
provisions the school law of Georgia; and both these distinguished 
gentlemen afterward, in public addresses delivered in my State,' de- 
clared the Georgia system to be the very best, with one or two excep- 
tions, in the United States.”

THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. AL 
pleted the one hundred and third year of its chartered existence and 
the eighty-seventh year of its active operations, properly introduces 
the subject of higher education. The earliest date associated with it 
is1784. On February 25th of that year the Legislature of Georgia passed 
an act laying out what were then called the counties of Franklin and 
Washington,! a territory which now embraces more than a dozen coun- 
ties as at present constituted. The eleventh section of that act con- 
veyed forty thousand aeres of those lands, then wild, to the Governor 
for the time being, and certain other persons named, in trust for the 
endowment of a college or seminary of learning, there being at that time 
no such institution in existence. The recital that ‘whereas, the en- 
couragement of religion and learning is an object of great importance 
to any community, and must tend to the prosperity, happiness, and ad- 
vantage of the same,”? was accompanied with directions to the county 
surveyors to “Jay out in each county twenty thousand acres of land of 
the first quality, in separate tracts of five thousand acres each.” These 
lands were severally vested in and granted to the Governor, and John 
Houstoun, James Habersham, William Few, Joseph Clay, Abraham

2*When, on July 8, 1783, the Legislature of Georgia assembled at Augusta, the Goy- 
ernor, Hon. Lyman Hall, in his message on that occasion, said: 
“Tn addition, therefore, to wholesome laws restraining vice, every encouragement 
ought to be given to introduce religion and learned clergy to perform divine worship 
in honor of God, and to cultivate principles of religion and virtue among our citizens. 
For this purpose, it will be your wisdom to lay an early foundation for endowing 
seminaries of learning; nor can you, I conceive, lay a better than by a grant of a 
sufficient tract of land that may, as in other governments, hereafter, by lease or other- 
wise, raise a revenue sufficient to support such valuable institutions.” 
This idea or suggestion of granting land to endow ‘‘such valuable institutions” is 
interesting, not only for the reason that it was the foundation stone in the history of 
tho University of Georgia, but 
subject of education in Georgia

Baldwin, William Houstoun, and Nathan Brownson, who were ap- 
pointed the trustees of the institution to be erected. 
In the passage of this act, Abraham Baldwin, a graduate of Yale, and 
one of the best scholars of his time, was chiefly instrumental. Though 
he had recently come to Georgia, Mr. Baldwin’s popularity was already 
so great as tosecure for him a seat in the General Assembly. During 
the session he originated the plan of the University of Georgia, and ob- 
tained from the Legislature the grant of land, as above stated, for its 
endowment. : 
BILL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. 
The Assembly, by an act passed on the 27th of January, 1785,! de- 
veloped almost into: maturity the germ of a University found in their 
legislation the previous year. Under this act a charter was granted to 
the persons above meiitioned, and to certain others named in addition,” 
as trustees of an institution to be established and to be called. the 
“University of Georgia.” The bill was entitled, ‘An act for the more 
full and complete establishment of a public seat of learning in this 
State,” and opens with a preamble which, in the language of Dr. Alonzo 
Church, “ would do honor to any Legislature, and will stand a monument 
to the wisdom and patriotism of those who framed and of those who 
adopted it.”*> This preamble reads as follows: 
“ As itis the distinguishing happiness of free governments that civil 
order should be the result of choice, and not necessity, and the com- 
mon wishes of the people become the laws of the land, their public pros- 
perity and even existence very much depends upon suitably forming 
the minds and morals of their citizens. When the minds of the people 
in general are viciously disposed and unprincipled, and their conduct 
disorderly, a free government will be attended with greater confusions 
and evils more horrid than the wild uncultivated state of nature. It 
ean only be happy where the public principles and opinions are prop- 
erly directed and their manners regulated. This is an influence beyond 
the reach of laws and punishments, and can be claimed only by relig- 
ion and education. It should, therefore, be among the first objects of 
those who wish well to the national prosperity, to encourage and sup- 
port the principles of religion and morality, and early to place the 
youth under the forming hand of society, that by instruction they may 
be moulded to the love of virtue and good order. Sending them abroad 
to other countries for their education will not answer these purposes, 
is too humiliating an acknowledgment of the ignorance or inferiority of

our own, and will always be the cause of so great foreign attachments, 
that upon principles of policy it is inadmissible. 
“This country, in the times of our common danger and distress, found 
security in the principles and abilities which wise regulations had before 
established in the minds of our countrymen; that our present happi- 
ness, joined to the pleasing prospects, should conspire to make us feel 
ourselves under the strongest obligations to form the youth, the rising 
hope of our land, to render the like glorious and essential services to our 
country.” 
The act provided that the general superintendence and regulation of 
the literature of this State should be confided to two bodies, one con- 
sisting of the Governor and Council, the Speaker of the House of As- 
sembly, and the Chief Justice, termed a “ Board of Visitors ;” and the 
other, consisting, as we have seen, of thirteen persons, to be called the 
“Board of Trustees.” These two bodies, united, were to constitute the 
‘¢Senatus Academicus of the University of Georgia.”! This ‘‘ Senatus 
Academicus” was to “consult and advise, not only upon the affairs of 
the University, but also to remedy the defects and advance the inter- 
ests of literature through the State in general.” 
The fourteenth section of this bill also declared tliat “all public 
schools instituted, or to be supported by funds or public moneys in this 
State, shall be considered as parts or members of the University, and 
shall be under the foregoing directions and regulations;” while by the 
ninth all the officers of the University were required to be “of the 
Christian religion,” and to “publicly take the oath of allegiance and 
fidelity.” 
LIBERAL SPIRIT OF THE CHARTER. 
That which is most striking in the charter of the University of Geor- 
gia, and which best indicates the catholic spirit in which it was con- 
ceived and drawn, is found in the eleventh section, wherein the trustees 
are forbidden to “exclude any person, of any religious denomination 
whatsoever, from free and equal liberty and advantages of education, 
!The union and joint operation of these boards no longer exist (for abolition of 
the Senatus Academicus, see Act of December 14, 1859, Laws of 1859, pp. 26-7). The- 
board of trustees, which originally consisted of thirteen members, has since been in- 
creased to thirty-six, and exercises an independent and unassisted control over the 
affairs and interests of the University. The Board of Visitors, as now known, is com- 
posed of five citizens annually appointed by the Governor, whose business it is ‘ to 
attend the examinations at the University of Georgia, preceding the annual com- 
mencement, and to examine personally into the condition and management of the in- 
stitution ;” they receiving as a compensation for their services (which must not ex- 
ceed ten days) four dollars a day, estimating from the date of leaving home. (Act 
of October 13, 1887, Laws of 1887, p. 67.) 
Five new members have been added to this board through the establishment of the 
Georgia School of Technology at Atlanta, the commissioners appointed for the erec- 
tion, equipment, and organization of that institution being regarded as ex-oficio trus- 
tees of the University.

  44 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
or from any of the liberties, privileges, and immunities of the Univer- 
sity in his education, on account of his or their speculative sentiments 
in religion, or being of a different religious profession.” Truly has it 
been said of this institution: “It was the creation of no one man or set 
of men; it was the gift of no political party; it was the offspring of no 
religious or denominational sect; it drew its life and being from the 
State by whom it was created. It was of the people, by the people, and 
for the people.””! 
After the act of 1785, under which the University of Georgia received 
its charter and its trustees were appointed, nothing more was done in 
its behalf for many years. Until the Constitution of 1798 ordained that” 
the next Legislature should take effectual measures for the University, 
it had no funds or donations except the forty thousand acres of wild 
land at first appropriated. These lands lay on the north-western fron- 
tier, and were open to the danger of Indian hostilities.2 This cireum- 
stance, in connection with the fact of theirexceeding cheapness,’ and the 
difficulty of securing purchasers, rendered them almost entirely unpro- 
ductive of income. The lands, therefore, of the University could not be 
made available for any valuable purpose, and the trustees were unable 
to give vitality to the institution. By the treaty of Beaufort, April 28, 
1787, about five thousand acres of the land granted to the University 
had been ceded to South Carolina, which reduced the am ount to thirty- 
five thousand acres; and even this amount was further curtailed by the 
fact that some of the University lands overlapped lands previously 
granted to other parties. 
'See McCord’s Speech, pp. 5-6. 
2 The country was perfectly wild,” writes Chancellor Tucker, ‘‘ and mostly unin- 
habited, except by Indians. Even in those portions of the State which were most 
thickly settled, and had been longest inhabited by white people, so savage was the 
condition that it was found necessary to provide, by the act of March 3, 1784, ‘that a 
guard, consisting of an officer and from six to twelve horsemen, be furnished to the 
  commanding officer of each county; that is to say, the guard of Chatham County, to | 
escort the President and Council to the lower line of Effingham County; that the 
guard of Effingham County be ready there to escort them to the lower line of Burke 
County ; and that the guard of Burke County be ready there to escort them to the 
lower line of Richmond County; and that the guard of Richmond County be ready 
there, to escort them to Augusta.’” (Tucker’s Address on the Condition, Interests, 
and Wants of the University of Georgia, pp. 13-14.) 
8“ Probably the whole forty thousand acres could not have been sold for one thousand 
dollars. * * * As an evidence of the low value set on these lands, it is worthy of 
notice, that the State offered to give five hundred acres of it to any man, and any kind 
of man, who would set up a saw mill on any portion of it—he to take his choice ; and 
on the same conditions, two thousand acres to any one who would set up a forge.” 
(Watkins, 205.) ‘‘To each head of a family who would settle on it, the State 
offered to give two hundred acres, with fifty acres additional for every member of his 
family, whether old or young, white or black.” (Ibid. , 234, 309, ete.) ‘If the sale of 
the forty thousand acres had been forced, it may well be doubted whether it would 
have brought three cents an acre.” (Tucker’s Address, pp. 13-15.)

THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. . 45 
FIRST MEETING OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE. 
   
                   
    
      
   
           
    
                                    The first meeting of the Senatus Academicus of the State, of which 
any record remains, was held at Louisville, in Jefferson County, in No- 
vember, 1799. The original intention! of the Legislature seems to have 
been to cause buildings for the University to be erected in that town, 
but the donation of Governor John Milledge? changed the plan. In 1801 
he gave to the trustees, for the benefit of the University, about six hun- 
dred and thirty acres of land, on a part of which the University build- 
ings are situated, and the rest of which is now occupied by the city of 
Athens. 
Soon afterward the institution went into operation. We have the 
following account of this event from the pen of Governor Wilson Lump- 
kin: * 
“Tn 1801,” he says, in a letter dated November 1, 1855, “ the trustees 
determined to put a college into operation. By tne patriotic donation 
of Governor Milledge, they had plenty of ground and a most eligible site 
to build upon; but they had no houses or money in hand to build them,* 
or even funds to pay a president of a college an adequate salary, or aid 
him by a faculty of any sort. 
JOSIAH MEIGS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF FRANKLIN COLLEGE. 
“Yet that most excellent man, with all his attainments, Josiah Meigs,° 
LL. D., was induced to accept the presidency, of what has been called 
Franklin College ever since the year 1801, with a limited and precarious 
salary, and if I am to rely upon record, without the aid of a professor 
or even a tutor,® and he continued in that office until 1811, his first 
classes reciting under the shades of a large oak, for the want of a better 
'See Watkins’s Digest, p.320, Act of January 26,1786. The expediency of estab- 
lishing the University at Greensborough was also at one time considered, the Legisla- 
! ture having, by an act for laying out Greene County within the limits of Franklin 
County, and including a portion of the University land, approved February 3, 1786 
(Watkins, pp. 322-3), authorized the trustees to lay out that town, sell the lots, and 
apply the proceeds to the benefit of the University. This project, however, did not 
meet with general favor. Efforts were also made to locate the institution in Han- 
cock, Columbia, and Wilkes Counties. 
2It is due to the memory of Mr. Milledge to say that he was one of the first with 
whom the idea of establishing our State University originated. He cordially united 
with the most eminent men in Georgia to carry out that important measure. 
3 Lewis’s Report, pp. 124-5. 
4When Franklin College was opened, we are told (Evans’s History of Georgia, p. 
124) that no suitable building had as yet been erected; and there were but two houses 
in Athens at that time. According to Chancellor Tucker’s account, the only college 
edifice was a frame building of only one room. (Tucker’s Address, p. 23.) 
5 He was a professor of natural philosophy and astronomy in Yale College, and was 
elected by the ‘‘Senatus Academicus” in 1800, at a salary of fifteen hundred dollars. 
(Stevens’s History of Georgia, Vol. II, p. 362.) 
6The truth was that he had tho assistanco of one professor for the first five years of 
his service, and of one tutor during the last five years, (Lewis's Report, p. 125.)

shelter. Yet in the ten years of Mr. Meigs’s presidency, upward of 
fifty students were graduated and received their regular degree of A. B.” 
The first commencement of Franklin College was held in May, 1804, 
the exercises being conducted under an arbor formed of branches of 
trees, upon the campus. “Here, in this rustic chapel, surrounded by 
the primeval forest, and amidst a gathering of a few friends of the 
institution, and a still larger number of persons assembled to witness 
the novel scene, Col. Gibson Clark, the Hon. Augustin S.. Clayton, 
General Jephtha V. Harris, Col. William H. Jackson, Prof. James Jack- 
son, Thomas Irwin, Jared Irwin, Robert Rutherford, Williams Ruther- 
ford, and William Williamson graduated with the honors of the insti- 
tution.” ! 
Upon the close of President Meigs’s term of service the exercises of — 
the college were, through lack of funds, suspended for a year. In 1812 
the Rey. John Brown, D. D., was called to the vacant chair, where he 
remained until 1816, when he resigned. During his administration up- 
ward of twenty students received diplomas.’ There were no classes in 
1813, in consequence of the war with Great Britain. 
At first the college had looked for its partial support to the rent 
accruing from the lands given by the State. In that early day English 
ideas were largely prevalent, and it was thought that a long rent-roll 
was the best of all endowments. Experience soon proved that in this 
new country the renting of lands was not profitable. Some of the lands 
were accordingly sold,’ and the college was sustained from the proceeds 
of such sales. It was soon discovered, however, that this plan was 
unwise, and afterward the lands were all sold, payment being made in 
the notes of the purchasers, bearing interest and secured by mortgage.4 
By the act of December 16, 1815, the State authorized the Governor to 
advance to the trustees any amount of money not exceeding two-thirds 
of the sum ealled for by these notes,’ and to receive the notes in lieu of 
the same. One hundred thousand dollars was the sum agreed upon, 
          
  
1 Stevens’s History of Georgia, Vol. II, p. 36: 
® Lewis's Report, p 125. 
3 None of the lands were sold until 1803, and then only a small portion, and at a 
low price.” (White’s Statistics of Georgia, p.73.) 
*Section II of the act of December 16, 1815 (Prince’s Digest, pp. 870-1), declares 
that ‘if the said trustees should dispose of the lands aforesaid upon a credit, the bonds 
given by the purchasers for the same shall be secured by good personal security, to- 
gether with a mortgage upon the land so purchased; and the said bonds and mort- 
gages, when collected, shall be applied by the said trustees to the subscription for 
stock in any banks now in this State, in case further subscriptions should be by them 
opened, or any bank which may hereafter be established by the State or the United 
States.” 
*Under the provisions of this act the University lands were sold, and, as nearly as 
has been ascertained, the aggregate amount of the sales was about one hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars, one hundred thousand of which, under the direction of the 
Legislature, were converted into bank stock, and the balance, it is supposed, was ap- 
plied to the purpose of reimbursing the State for advances made to the University 
from time to time. (Lewis's Report, p. 119.) 4.

THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. AT 
but as the money was not paid, this amount was regarded as a debt due 
to the University by the State, and it was agreed that interest should 
be paid upon the same at the rate of eight per cent. per annum. In 
compliance with this arrangement, the sum of eight thousand dollars 
has been regularly and annually paid by the State to the University to 
the present day. The act establishing this permanent University fund 
was not passed until December 21, 1821.1 “ Finally,” says Governor 
Lumpkin, in a letter dated November, 1855,’ “ what has been called the 
permanent endowment of the University was made by the act of the 
Legislature of 1821, by which the State took into its own keeping the 
one hundred thousand dollars of bank stock owned by the University, 
and secured to the University the payment of eight per cent. per annum 
on one hundred thousand dollars ; since which date the limited financial 
condition of the institution has been free from any serious embarrass- 
ment.” 
Dr. John Brown was succeeded in the presidency of the college by 
Robert Finley, D. D., of Baskingridge, N. J., whose term was brief. It 
was terminated by his death in 1817. Then ensued an interregnum, oc- 
casioned chiefly through the inability of the Board of Trustees to organ- 
ize the faculty in a satisfactory manner. This lasted until 1819, when 
the Rev. Dr. Moses Waddell was elected president. Franklin College 
was then in a very unfortunate plight. ‘ When he took charge of it,” 
writes Governor Gilmer, “there were neither funds, professors, nor 
students.” Doctor Waddell was an admirable disciplinarian and organ- 
izer.t Under his management the institution was established upon a 
firmer and better basis than at any former time. The attendance of 
students increased, and the Board secured the services of a respectable 
number of professors and enlarged the library’ and apparatus.’ His 
term expired in 1829, when the Rev. Alonzo Church, D. D., of Brattle- 
berough, Vt., was called to the chair. The latter had for some years 
been filling the professorship of mathematics and astronomy in the in- 
stitution. 
  
1 Prince’s Digest, pp.873-4._ The act was entitled ‘‘An Act to provide for the per- 
manent endowment of the University, and to appropriate moneys for the erettion of 
a new collegiate edifice at Athens.”

+Doctor Waddell had taught a large academy in Abbeville (S. C.) with remarkable 
success, for a number of years. Under his tuition some of the most distinguished 
men in Georgia and South Carolina received, in whole or in part, their education. 
From long and successful experience he had acquired a reputation for the govern- 
ment and instruction of youths which amply qualified him to give character and 
reputation to the college, as subsequent events abundantly proved. (Georgia Gazet- 
teer, 1837, p. 119. See also Ramsay’s History of South Caroiina, Vol. I, pp. 369-71.) 
' This was originally due to an act approved November 28, 1806 (Clayton’s Digest, 
p- 308), by which the trustees had been allowed to establish a lottery for the purpose 
of raising three thousand dollars to purchase a library for the use of the University,

48 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
In 1830 one of the main college buildings,! including the library and 
a portion of the apparatus, was destroyed by fire; and to replace the 
loss thus incurred, and also to aid in the current expenses, an appropri- 
ation of six thousand dollars was made by the Legislature,’ which was 
annually continue! from 1830 until 1841. While this fund has been 
regarded by some in the light of a donation from the State, it would 
appear to have been really nothing more than an acknowledgment by 
the State of a long outstanding debt. For, when the thirty-five thousand 
acres of land were sold and brought one hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars or more, only one hundred thousand dollars, as has been seen, 
were invested in bank stock for the benefit of the University, leaving 
about seventy-five thousand dollars, beside the five thousand acres 
Jost under the treaty of Beaufort, unaccounted for, in the hands of the 
State. This liability was met by an annual appropriation of the intcrest 
thereon, which was estimated at six thousand dollars. 
ASSISTANCE TO THE UNIVERSITY BY THE STATE. 
The first money advanced by the State to the University consisted 
of five thousand dollars, paid in 1802. Another loan of ten thousand 
dollars was made in 1816,‘ and still another of the same amount in 1830. 
The last-mentioned sum was to be employed in repairing the damage 
inflicted by fire in buildings and equipment. In the same year, it will 
be remembered, the six thousand dollar appropriation began, which 
was in part devoted to the same object. 
From 1841, when this appropriation was discontinued, until 1875, a 
period of thirty-four years, nothing whatever appears to have been con- 
tributed to the University by the State. In February of the latter year 
anact was passed® giving five thousand dollars a year for three years 
to the “ Georgia State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts,” 
which was a branch of the University, the origin and history of which 
will be shortly considered. On the 29th of September, 1881,° the Legis- 
lature appropriated two thozsand dollars per year for four years, to 
make tuition free; and on September 27, 1884,7 an appropriation of two 
thousand five hundred dollars was made to repair certain buildings’ on 
the college campus.

The most recent State donation to the University was that which was 
effected during the last session of the General Assembly, in October, 
1887.1 By four separate enactments of the same date, five thousand 
dollars were given to the University to repair its buildings; five thou- 
sand, for a similar purpose, to the branch college at Dahlonega; and 
thirty-five hundred dollars each to the branch colleges established at 
Thomasville and Milledgeville. These sums, inclusive of the amount 
realized from the sale of the forty thousand acres of land, conveyed by 
the act of February 25, 1784, made available by the State by the ad- 
vance of sixty-six and two-thirds cents on the dollar, and forming the 
endowment fund of the University from which the eight thousand dol- 
lar annuity is drawn, constitute all the pecuniary assistance which the 
State has, in one way or another, given to what Chancellor Tucker 
terms ‘the child and property of Georgia.” 
New College was built about 1831. Like Old College, it is used as a 
dormitory for the accommodation of students. In the following year 
the Ivy Building and the chapel were erected; and from 1834 dates the 
construction of the Phi Kappa Hall. This belongs to the Phi Kappa 
Literary Society, which was founded in 1820, Washington’s birthday 
being the anniversary of its establishment? The other literary society 
of the University, the Demosthenian, was founded as early as the year 
1802,? and is therefore almost coeval with the opening of Franklin 
College.. Its annual meetings are held on February 19th of each year. 
Both of these societies are in active and successful operation, and have 
always been regarded as important factors in the college training. 
Each has a library of about three thousand volumes. 
PRIVATE BENEFACTIONS. 
In 1854 Dr. William Terrell, of Hancock County, bequeathed twenty 
thousand dollars to the University, which it still retains. With this 
fund, says Governor Herschel V. Johnson in his message of 1855,‘ an 
agricultural chair was established, the interest of this gift being ap- 
plied to the support of its professor. This was the second benefac- . 
tion which the institution received from private sources, the first hav- 
ing been Governor Milledge’s land gift in 1801. The bequest of Gov- 
ernor George R. Gilmer should be next mentioned. By it he donated 
fifteen thousand dollars to the trustees for the purpose of improving 
the “school-masters of Georgia.” In 1873 the city of Athens gave the 
sum of twenty-five thousand dollars for the erection of what is known

as the “ Moore College.” This structure was completed in the follow- 
ing year, and is by far the handsomest building on the campus. It is 
three stories high, exclusive of the mansard roof. The entire first floor 
and basement are appropriated to the use of the chemical department, 
and contain, among other things, analytical laboratories, an assay-room, 
a room for microscopic and spectroscopic work, and an industrial mu- 
seum. The second floor is devoted to the department of natural philos- 
ophy, and the third to that of engineering. Moore College is the seat 
of the “Georgia State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.” 
THE CHARLES MCDONALD BROWN SCHOLARSHIP FUND. 
The most recent and noteworthy donation to. the University was 
made by Senator Joseph KE. Brown, ex-Governor of Georgia, in 1881, 
and is known as the Charles McDonald Brown Scholarship Fund. This 
fund, consisting of fifty thousand dollars, bears the name of one of Sen- 
ator Brown’s sons, who died while prosecuting his studies at the Uni- 
versity, and by whom, had he lived, this sam might have been pos- 
sessed. The income arising from this fund is intended to “ aid worthy 
young men of the State in their efforts to get an education,” and four 
students are, each year, enabled to avail themselves of the assistance 
thus afforded. An applicant for benefits under this fund must be 
“eighteen years old, of good moral character, apt to learn, of reason- 
able healtli and proper ambition,” and “he must be prepared at least for 
the Freshman class.” Money is loaned out only. to those who, un- 
aided, would not be able to acquire a university education, on the con- 
dition that they refund the money thus loaned, as soon as they can 
make it, after providing for their livelihood in an economical manner; 
and the amount which is repaid by each student, with interest at four - 
per cent., in return for the money he has received, is added annually to 
the principal of the endowment. Young men pursuing their studies for 
the purpose of preparing themselves for the ministry, or who, after com- 7 
pleting their studies, may devote themselves to the work of the minis- 
try, are required to return with interest only one-half the amount loaned 
to them. The colleges participating in the benefits of this fund are 
those at Athens and Dahlonega, and the Medical School at Augusta. 
Doctor Church’s administration closed in 1859. He had served the 
University in the capacity of president for thirty years. About the 
same time the Senatus Academicus of the State of Georgia was abol- 
ished, and all its rights, powers, duties, and privileges were given 
to the Board of Trustees of the University of Georgia, in whom was 
vested the sole government of that institution, subject to the direction 
of the General Assembly of the State.! In 1860 the title of president 
was changed to that of chancellor, Rev. Andrew A. Lipscomb, D. D.,

tee an act of the Congress of. the United States, approved July 2, 
1862, there was given to each of the States, for educational purposes, 
an amount of land equal in quantity to thirty thousand acres for each 
Senator and Representative to which the State was entitled under the 
apportionment of 1860. The State of Georgia, by the act of March 10, 
1866, accepted this grant of land on the conditions specified in the grant, 
and by the act of December 12, 1866, the Governor was empowered to 
receive and sell the serip representing the said land, and to invest the 
proceeds for the purposes mentioned in the grant. The amount real- 
ized from the sale of this scrip was $242,202. On the 30th of March, 
1872, His Excellency James M. Smith, Governor of Georgia, transferred 
the fund thus obtained to the trustees of the University of Georgia, 
and on the Ist day of May, 1872, the trustees opened and established 
the “Georgia State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.” 
This institution was a distinct organization, complete in all its ‘parts, 
but still constituting an integral school of the University of Georgia, 
controlled by the trustees of the latter, aud presided over by the chan- 
cellor ex officio. There are thus two colleges in one. The students of 
both are taught by the professors of each, in the same lecture and reci- 
tation rooms, largely from the same text-books, and frequently in the 
same classes. The combination has proved harmouious and advan- 
tageous. 
THE ELECTIVE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED. 
In 1869 what is known as the “Old College curriculum” was for the 
most part displaced by giving the students, on certain conditions, an 
elective course of study, and by establishing various other degrees in 
addition to those formerly conferred. ‘Retaining the undergraduate 
course and adding to the old-time ,A. B. curriculum other curricula, so 
as to give undergraduates the option of modern languages and of a 
1JIn a report of the trustees of the Tniversity of Georgia to the Governor (gouenn 
E. Brown), dated October 2, 1860, appears the following: “At the meeting of the 
Board of Trustees of the University of Georgia, which lasted from July 27 to August 
3, 1860, inclusive, the offices of chancellor and vice-chancellor were created, Rev. 
Andrew A. Lipscomb, D. D., being called to fill the first place, and Rev. P. H. Mell, 
D. D., professor of moral and mental philosophy, being elected to the second. The 
Faculty, as at that time organized, consisted, in addition to the above-named officers, 
of William S. Rutherford, Jr., A. M., professor of mathematics and astronomy; Will- 
iam H. Waddell, A. M., professor of ancient languages; Richard M. Johnston, A. M., 
professor of oratory and belles-lettres; James Woodrow, Ph. D., professor of natural 
philosophy, chemistry, and natural sciences; William D. Wasb, A. M., adjunct pro- 
fessor of mathematics and natural philosophy; and Dr. Daniel Lee Terrell, professor 
of agriculture.” (Quoted in Lewis’s Report on Public Education, p. 42.) 
? There was a suspension of college exercises from September 1, 1863,. to January 1, 
1866.

greater degree of philosophy and science than was admissible in the 
chiefly disciplinary A. B. course,” writes the late Chancellor Mell,! “ it 
{the University | added schools in which young men might prepare them- 
selves as civil and mining engineers, as chemists, as physicists, and as 
scientific farmers.” Since about 1870 the new system of instruction, 
which is termed the University system, has been in force; and there are 
now, besides the A. B. course, bachelor of philosophy, of science, of 
chemical science, of agriculture, and of engineering, and master of arts 
courses, all of which end in degrees. | 
The year 1873 is remembered as that in which the University entered 
into arrangements with the Medical College at Augusta, in pursuance of 
which the latter became one of its departments. With this event we 
have no present concern, as the Medical College will be considered at 
length elsewhere. 
NORTH GEORGIA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AT DAHLONEGA. 
_ We therefore turn our attention to the North Georgia Agricultural 
College at Dahlonega (Lumpkin County), which was opened in Jan- 
uary, 1873. The school owed its origin to the act of Congress of July 
2, 1862, entitled “An Act donating public lands to the several States 
and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agricult- 
ure and the mechanie arts.” The act contemplated the ‘endowment, 
support, and maintenance of at least one college where the leading 
object shall be, without excluding other scientific aud classical studies, 
and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as 
are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the 
Legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to pro- 
mote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes.” 
By an act of March 10, 1866, as has been observed, the General 
Assembly of Georgia accepted the donation “upon the terms and con- 
ditions prescribed” in the act of Congress; and, upon the receipt of 
the fand, the interest of it, amounting to about seventeen thousand 
dollars, was placed under the control of the trustees of the University, 
to carry into effect the objects of the act. The North Georgia Agri- 
cultural College, having been incorporated in 1871, received from the 
United States Government, in pursuance of an act of Congress in that 
year, a donation of the building at Dahlonega previously known as 
the United States Branch Mint, with ten acres of land connected there- 
with. <A contract was then made with the trustees of the University, 
by which the North Georgia Agricultural College became a branch and 
part of the University, the title to the above-mentioned property being 
conveyed to the trustees of that institution, on the conditions specified 
in the donation; they appointing the president of the college, making 
a certain allowance for its support, and exercising over it a general

supervision. The charter of the college authorizes it to confer degrees, 
viz, the A. B. and B.S. degrees.. The degree usually conferred, how- 
ever, is that of A. B.; the design being to make the curriculum as 
nearly as possible the same as that prescribed in the bachelor of arts 
course at Athens. 
The privileges of this school are enjoyed by both sexes. It is a com- 
mon thing for the A. B. degree to be conferred upon females at Dahl- 
onega. 
Military tactics form an important feature in the college course. The ° 
instruction in this department is both theoretical and practical—the 
former, bya study of the tactics prescribed in the United States Army ; 
the latter, through actual drills in artillery and infantry tactics, and in 
other military exercises. 
This college is a participant in the benefits of the Charles McDonald 
Brown Scholarship Fund, from which it receives one thousand dollars 
annually,! 
Hon. David W. Lewis was the first president of Dahlonega, and the 
students in attendance during its first session numbered one hundred 
and seventy-seven. 
BRANCH COLLEGES AT THOMASVILLE, CUTHBERT, AND MILLEDGE- 
VILLE. 
In addition to the college at Dahlonega, three other “ Branch Col- 
leges” of the University have been established, viz: the South Georgia 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, which was opened at 
Thomasville, Thomas County, in September, 1879; the South-West 
Georgia Agricultural College, located at Cuthbert, Randolph County, 
and opened during the same month ;? and the Middle Georgia Military 
and Agricultural College, at Milledgeville, Baldwin County, which com- 
menced operations in January, 1880.° In reference to the school at 
Cuthbert, it is proper to state that it is no longer a branch of the Uni- 
versity. It ceased to be regarded as such in 1885, when its directors 
failed to comply with their contract with the trustees. Prior to this 
event about seven thousand dollars of the interest of the land serip 
fund had been annually distributed among the branch colleges.>

  54 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
Like the North Georgia Agricultural College, the schools at Thomas- 
ville and Milledgeville are mixed schools, and in them members of both 
sexes are taught. In them, too, military exercises form a part of the in- 
struction. But, unlike Dahlonega, they are considered as merely pre- 
paratory schools for the University, their collegiate capacity being lim- 
ited to the Freshman and Sophomore years, after which students are 
expected to repair to the parent and central institution, and there com- 
plete their course. The old State Capitol buildings, which were granted 
to the trustees of the University of Georgia for the purpose of establish- 
ing a branch college at Milledgeville, are at present occupied by the 
college, and are said to furnish ample accommodations for the students. 
Doctor Lipscomb’s term ef office expiring in 1874, Rev. Henry H. 
Tucker, D. D., LL. D., who had previously? been the president of Mercer 
University, sueceeded to the chancellorship of the University. He oceu- 
pied this position till 1878, when the late lamented Rev. P. I. Mell, D. D., 
LL. D., was elected. For almost a decade did this worthy chancellor 
preside over the affairs of the University. Only afew months? ago was 
he ealled away from a life of energetic usefulness and unswerving de- 
votion to the charges committed to his keeping. 
Under the University system there are,in addition to the three branch 
colleges and the Medical Department at Augusta, already alluded to, 
the Franklin and State Colleges and a Law Department at Athens, 
FRANKLIN COLLEGE. 
In Franklin College four courses of study are open to the student: 
the classical or bachelor of arts course; the literary or bachelor of 
philosophy course, which differs from the A. B. course in so far as it 
allows the substitution of French and German for the Latin and Greek 
of the latter course; the scientific course; and the master of arts or 
highest and most comprehensive course in the University. There are ten 
Academic Schools in Franklin College: School of the Latin Language 
and Literature; the Greek Language and Literature; the Modern Lan- 
guages; Belles-Lettres, including rhetoric, criticism, and esthetics; Meta- 
physies and Ethics; Mathematics; Physies and Astronomy; Chemis- 
try; History and Political Science; and Biology and Geology. All of 
these schools enter into the composition of a master of arts degree, 
and consequently the receipt of an A. M. diploma implies that the stu- 
dent has satisfactorily availed himself of all the privileges of the cvl- 
lege. While the amount of work imposed by this course is, perhaps, 
greater than that experienced in the other courses of the University, 
the duration of it is less, the master of arts course only extending 
through the Junior and Senior years.

THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. 55 
THE STATE COLLEGE. 
The State College embraces schools of Agriculture, Engineering, and 
Applied Chemistry. That of Agriculture is designed principally for 
the sons of farmers, or other young men who purpose making farming 
their leading occupation, and is a strictly professional school. There 
are four classes in this school, during the first two of which English, 
arithmetic, trigonometry, mensuration and surveying, and book-keep- 
ing are studied. Students of the Junior year pursue the studies of gen- 
eral chemistry, physics, natural history, embracing botany and zodlogy, 
experimental field-work at the farm,' and practical work in the chemical 
and biological laboratories; and those of the Senior class studies in in- 
dustrial and agricultural chemistry, agriculture, theoretical and practi- 
cal, and geology and mineralogy. Bachelor of agriculture is the degree 
conferred in this school. The courses in engineering and applied chem- 
istry occupy likewise four years. The diplomas awarded in these de- 
partments are bachelor of engineering and bachelor of chemical science. 
In referring to the work accomplished by the State College, the late 
Chancellor Mell, in a letter to Martin V. Calvin, Esq. (of Augusta), dated 
September 19, 1887, says: “In the State College of Agriculture here 
has been given the most thorough instruction in those departments of 
science that have most intimate relation with scientific agriculture. 
Scattered all over Georgia are accomplished physicists and chemists, 
who are competent to give scientific instruction and practical aid in 
such scientific analyses as farmers need, who obtained their culture in 
the halls of the Agricultural College here. Through the agency of this 
institution then, there have been given to the State not a small number 
of men who are thoroughly versed in all those sciences that make the 
important factors in scientific agriculture. Ninety-four (94) accom- 
plished young men have graduated from the Agricultural College here 
during the few years of its existence,’ and fifty-one undergraduates 
enrolled themselves on its books as matriculates last year.” 
THE LAW DEPARTMENT. 
The Law Department of the University is the successor to the Lump- 
kin Law School, which was established in 1859.° Of this the professors 
were Joseph H. Lumpkin, Thomas R, R. Cobb, and William Hope Hull. 
This school ended, co nomine, with the death of Chief-Justice Lumpkin, 
when the present Law Department was inaugurated. Since it was or- 
' This farm, located at what is known as “ Rock College ” (built in 1861), in the sub- 
urbs of Athens, consists of some sixty-five acres, fifty of which are under cultivation.

3See act of December 19, 1859. (Laws of 1859, p. 84.)

ganized the professors of law have been William L. Mitcheil, Benjamin 
H. Hill, William M. Browne, Pope Barrow, George Dudley Thomas, 
and Andrew J. Cobb. The last two are now in office, and are assisted 
by Samuel C. Benedict as lecturer on medical jurisprudence. 
The course of instruction in the Law Department is completed in one 
year, consisting of two terms, the first being devoted to the study of 
Blackstone’s Commentaries, Broom’s Commentaries on the Common 
Law, and the Constitutions of the United States and of the State of 
Georgia; and the second term to the study of the principles of plead- 
ing, evidence, equity, commercial law, and the Code of Georgia. Dur- 
ing this second term frequent moot courts are held, in which one of 
the professors presides, and the students are taught the actual practice 
of their profession. A study of medical jurisprudence is embraced in 
the course; and, until his death, it was the custom of Chancellor Mell 
to deliver lectures to the students on parliamentary law.' At the end 
of the course students receive their diplomas, by virtue of which they 
are admitted without examination to practise in the superior courts of 
the State of Georgia, and in all other courts of the State except the Su- 
preme Court. To this latter court the diploma admits when the good 
moral character” of the applicant is properly vouched for. 
SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The first free scholarship established at the University of Georgia 
appears to have been founded upon a donation of the late Robert Tay- 
lor, Esq., of the city of Athens, who bequeathed a certain amount to 
support a young man at college. This failed because of the fact that it 
was based upon property owned at the time of his death, which became 
valueless in consequence of the emancipation of slaves. 
When the State College of Agriculture was organized, a free scholar- 
ship was awarded, for appointment, to each member of the Legislature, 
anda certain number were given to the city of Athens, which had do- 
nated twenty-five thousand dollars for the construction of a building? 
Writing of these scholarships in 1875, Chancellor Tucker says :* “The 
University offers tuition free to three hundred and fifteen students. 
About one hundred of these free scholarships are occupied, and we now 
offer two hundred and fifteen more to the people of Georgia. Itis but 
‘Chancellor Mell wrote in 1876 4 Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which is the 
text-book used in the University. This work is held in high repute throughout the 
Southern States. The Chancellor was a fine presiding officer, and in that capacity 
performed long and valuable services. 
*See Catalogue, 1886-87. The Code of Georgia, 1882, p. 255, provides that “any 
law student having a diploma of graduation, signed by the proper authority of the 
University, is entitled to plead and practise law i in all the courts of law and equity of 
this State on the same terms of the graduates of the Lumpkin Law. School.”

fair, however, to say that two hundred and fifty free scholarships are 
on the bounty of the land scrip fund, which was a gift from the Con- 
gress of the United States, and only sixty-five are on the bounty of 
what is called Franklin College. But as matters now stand, both the 
Agricultural College and Franklin College are constituent parts of the 
University of Georgia; the students of both occupy the same buildings, 
are taught by the same instractors, and enjoy the same privileges.” In 
1877 we are told that “ fifty meritorious young men of limited means,” 
residents of Georgia, were admitted to the academic department (Frank- 
lin College) free of tuition, in return for which they were expected to 
teach in the State for a term of years equal to the time they had en- 
joyed the advantages of the University; and that needy students in- 
tending to enter the ministry also received tuition free.! 
Upon the introduction of free tuition for all departments of the Uni- 
versity, except the Law and Medical Departments, in 1881, free scholar- 
ships of course ceased to exist. The Charles McDonald Brown Scholar- 
ship Fund, established about the same time, constitutes the only student 
help now afforded at the University. 
THE LIBRARIES OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
There are four libraries in the University: the college library, con- 
taining some thirteen thousand volumes; the Gilmer library,which is a 
collection of about one thousand volumes of select literature, bequeathed 
to the University by His Excellency the late ex-Governor George R. 
Gilmer;? and the Demosthenian and Phi Kappa libraries, consisting 
each of some three thousand volumes. In addition to the general 
library of the University, the Law Department has a special library con- 
taining many of the standard law books. It may not be inappropriate 
to mention in this connection that the branch college at Milledgeville 
has recently come into possession of a library cf about three thousand 
volumes. There are also several thousand books in the library of the 
Medical Department at Augusta. 
It is claimed that the University of Georgia has the finest physical 
and chemical apparatus in the South, the physical being valued at ten 
thousand dollars. It possesses also a large collection of mineralogical 
and geological specimens, and is well supplied with engineering mod- 
els and machines for testing the strength of materials. 
THE PROPERTY OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
The property of the University, including its ten main college build. 
ings, which cost in the aggregate one hundred and forty thousand dol- 
lars, and the apparatus, which is worth fifty thousand more, has an

estimated value of $663,000.'!| Beside the campus, which consists of 
thirty-seven acres of land and is a part of the original gift of Governor 
Milledge, there is an experimental farm of sixty acres at Rock College, 
in the suburbs of Athens, belonging to the University. 
Large numbers have graduated from the University of Georgia, and 
many ofits alumni have been prominent, both in the State and the Fed- 
eral Government.? The various chairs have been occupied by seventy- 
seven professors,’ and there have been forty-two tutors. The college 
has graduated seventy-nine classes. According to Chancellor Tucker's 
estimate, made in 1875,‘ the University has given to the State one hun- 
dred ministers, twenty-six Congressmen, nine supreme court justices, 
fifty superior court judges, thirty presidents or professors of colleges, 
about two hundred legislators, four governors, and two bishops. In- 
clusive of its undergraduates, it has been instrumental in the education 
of fully six thousand personsin Georgia. During the session of 1887-88 
there were in attendance upon all the departments of the University 
1,177 students. 
The University of Georgia is now under the efficient and energetic 
management of the Rey. Dr. William E. Boggs, of Memphis, Tenn. He 
was elected to the position of chancellor, as successor to the late Doctor 
Mell, in October, 1888. 
GEORGIA SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY. 
On October 13, 1885, an act’ to establish a technological school as a 
branch of the State University, to appropriate money for the same, and 
for other purposes, was passed by the General Assembly of Georgia. 
In it provision was made for the appointment of five ‘fit and discreet 
1 See Centennial Catalogue, etc. (published 1835). 
*Among them may be mentioned Alexander H. Stephens, Howell Cobb, Benjamin 
H. Will, and Herschel V. Johnson. It may also be interesting to know that Dr. 
Crawford W. Long, the discoverer of anwsthesia, was a graduate of this institution. 
8 The faculty of instruction at Athens, including the professors of Jaw and the lect- 
urer on medical jurisprudence, at present consists of eleven professors. 
Among the professors at different times connected with the University may bo 
mentioned the Rey. Patrick H. Mell, D. D., LL. D., James P. Waddell, William II. 
Waddell, and William G. Woodfin, in the department of ancient languages; C. P. 
Wilcox, A. M., in that of modern languages; Charles F. McCay, A. M., LL. D., John

persons,” citizens of the State, to be known as the Commission on the 
School of Technology, whose business it should be to procure the grounds 
and buildings necessary for the establishment of the institetion. That 
school was to be located within or near the corporate limits of that city 
or town in the State which should offer the best inducements for such 
location in the opinion of the Commission. Preference was to be given 
to such place as should be easy of access to all the people of the State, 
due regard being had to the appropriateness, eligibility, and healthful- 
ness of the surroundings. The selection, once made, was to be final. It 
was further enacted that when so established the school should be a 
part of the University of Georgia, and come under the control and 
management of its Board of Trustees, and the general supervision of its 
chancellor; that its officers should be a president, a superintendent of 
the manual department, a secretary and treasurer of the faculty, and 
such other professors, teachers, and instructors as should be necessary, 
in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, to carry on the school in aecord- 
ance with the intention of the act; that a course of practical training 
in the use and manufacture of tools and machines for wood and iron 
working should be provided for all the students of the school; and that 
the curriculum should include, as near as practicable, consistent with 
the appropriation,! the branches now taught and followed in the Free 
Institute of Industrial Science at Worcester, Mass.” 
Atlanta has been chosen as the seat of the School of Technology. 
It was selected both with reference to its central situation and on ac- 
count of the liberal inducements offered, the city giving fifty thousand 
dollars in cash, and fifty thousand dollars in the shape of a twenty- 
five hundred dollar annuity for twenty years, while the citizens con- 
tributed twenty thousand dollars in cash, and the land for the site, 
which is valued at ten thousand dollars. No members of the faculty, 
except the president, Dr. Isaac S. Hopkins, who at present occupies a 
like position in Emory College, and two of the professors have been 
elected. There are two college buildings, which, it is hoped, will be 
ready for occupation by August 1st of the current year (1888).° 
1 Sixty-five thousand dollars. 
*This institution ‘‘was founded by John Boynton in 1865, through a conviction that 
it is possible advantageously to unite in a course of training thorough mental discipline 
and a knowledge of the application of science to some of the practical arts. It offers 
a good education, based on the mathematics, living languages, physical sciences, and 
drawing; and gives sufficient practical instruction in some branch of applied science 
to secure to its graduates a livelihood. It is specially designed for those who wish to 
become mechanics, civil engincers, chemists, or designers. Special prominence is 
given to the element of practice, which is required in every department. The train- 
ing of students preparing for mechanical engineers occupies three and a half years; 
that of all others threo years of forty-two wecks each.” (Report of the Commissioner 
of Education, 1884-85, p. 135.) 
3 Since writing the above, a prospectus of the Georgia School of Technology has 
been issued, a faculty of instruction secured, and the institution regularly opened to 
students, The school is now (1889) in successful operation.

GEORGIA BAPTIST CONVENTION, 
This institution is the property of the Baptists, and owed its origin 
to the Georgia Baptist Convention, under whose auspices it was founded. 
At the annual session of that body at Buekhead Church, Burke County, 
jn the spring of 1831, the Rey. Adiel Sherwood offered a resolution, 
which was adopted, to establish in some central part of the State, as 
soon as the funds should justify it, a classical and theological school,

which would “unite agricultural labor with study, and be opened for 
those only preparing for the ministry.”! The idea of founding a manual 
labor school, where theory and practice should be taught,—a scheme 
much in favor with Georgia Baptists,—seems to have originated with 
Doctor Sherwood,’ who was the first to demonstrate its feasibility in 
the academy established by him near Eatonton, in Putnam County, 
early in 1832.2 His plan, as then presented, contemplated an institu- 
tion exclusively for the benefit and training of young ministers. At the 
next meeting of the convention, however, which was held at Powellton 
in 1832, the resolution was modified so as to admit “others besides 
students of divinity.” 
Lands and money having been subscribed, a site was chosen for the 
proposed school, seven miles north of Greensborough, in Greene County, 
identical with the location of the present village of Penfield, in Ogle- 
thorpe County. 
‘ REV. JESSE MERCER. 
The school, called Mercer Institute, was so named in honor of the 
Rev. Jesse Mercer, a Baptist divine and philanthropist, well known 
throughout Georgia for his zeal, liberality, and piety. He was one of 
the earliest advocates of a thorough educational system, and of him it 
has been said that “he was the most influential minister of his day, 
and perhaps the most distinguished minister of the denomination ever 
reared up in the State.”* Deeply did Mr. Mercer appreciate the com- 
pliment thus paid him, and of this his subsequent acts gave proof. 
“As it was determined by his brethren that the seminary should bear 
his honored name, from its first establishment it engaged his unremit- 
ting solicitude. * * * Indeed the part which he took in the nurture 
and endowment of this institution® may be considered the most impor- 
tant and prominent of the many and useful benevolent services of his 
whole life.”® 
One of the objects of the Georgia Baptist Convention,’ as set forth 
in its constitution, was “to afford an opportunity to those, who may con- 
scientiously think it their duty, to form a fund for the education of pious 
young men who may be called by the spirit and their churches to the 
Christian ministry.” From 1826 to 1832 several beneficiaries were 
adopted by the Conyention, and no less than eight received aid from 
the Convention in the last-named year. In 1828, Josiah Penfield, a de-

vout deacon of the Savannah Baptist Church, offered to give twenty-five 
hundred dollws toward a fund for the eadbadind of young ministers, 
provided the Convention would contribute an equal amount. More than 
twenty-five hundred doliars were subscribed by the delegates at the 
Convention in Milledgeville in March, 1829, From this Penfield legacy, 
and from annual additions, grew the permanent fund for the education 
of young ministers, which at one time amounted to thirty-three thou- 
sand four hundred dollars. 
CLASSICAL AND THEOLOGICAL SCHOOL ESTABLISHED. 
Having an educational fund, the Convention, as before stated, re- 
solved in 1831 to establish a classical and theological school to be con- 
nected with manual labor; and in the following year a subscription of 
fifteen hundred dollars was reported and a site was chosen. The exec- 
utive committee who had charge of the matter from the first acted on 
the maxim ‘do not goin debt,” and made the best arrangements which 
the means in hand would permit. The buildings were located in what 
is now the village of Penfield, and consisted of “two double cabins, 
with a garret to each, for dwelling, for dining, and for study, for both 
teachers and students.” 
THE FIRST PRINCIPAL, MR» SANDERS. 
“With these limited accommodations,” continues the Rev. B. M. 
Sanders, the first and only principal of Mercer Institute, “I opened the 
institution in.January, 1833, with thirty-nine students, having thirty- 
six of them to board in my own family.- Among those were seven young 
men preparing for the ministry. 
“TJ shall ever remember with lively emotions of pleasure! the patience 
and cheerfulness with which the students of this year sustained the 
privations and trials to which they were subjected by their cramped 
circumstances. They may be truly said to have borne hardness like 
good soldiers. While living as in a camp in their midst, and burdened 
with the charge and responsibility of the literary, theological, labor- 
ing, and boarding departments, I found no little support in all my 
cares and labors from witnessing that, while they lived upon the 
cheapest fare, had no place for study but the common school-room, no 
place to retire to for rest but a garret without fire in the coldest 
weather, and labored diligently three hours every day, no complaint 
was heard, but that the most entire cheerfulness ran through all their 
words and actions. 
“Tn a word, those favorable indications of the success of the enter- 
prise soon began to ees its friends with confidence, and to animate

their efforts for the extension of its advantages. An amount was soon 
raised to erect another large wooden building, with eight comfortable 
rooms for dormitories, and a brick basement for chapel and school- 
rooms. 
“The second year’s operations were commenced with increased accom- 
modations, with an additional teacher and eighty students, seventy of 
whom boarded in commons. During the second and third years, the 
building of a larger and more comfortable dwelling, a commodious 
dining-room, and two society halls, abundantly increased both the com- 
forts and conveniences of the institution.” 3 
The growth of Mercer Institute was gradual until 1837, when a new 
departure was made, the result of which was its elevation to the char- 
acter and dignity of a college. Inspired by the example of the Pres- 
byterians, who were contemplating the erection of a college at Midway,' 
near Milledgeville, in Baldwin County, the Baptists determined to build 
one at Washington (Wilkes County). Into this movement Mr. Mercer 
had gone with all earnestness, contrary to his usual principle of not 
dividing resources. A hundred thousand dollars had been subscribed 
for the school at Washington,? when it was decided to give up the at- 
tempt, since it was feared that the denomination could not support both 
institutions. The great financial panic which overwhelmed the country 
in 1837, and delayed the operations of some of the most solid institu- 
tions for several years, was the chief motive for. this determination. 
The establishment of the Southern Baptist College* at Washington was, 
therefore, abandoned by its projectors, at a meeting of the Board in 
Athens in 1837, in consequence of the embarrassments: of the times, 
the inadequacy of the means in hand, ete. It was then determined to 
connect a collegiate department with the Mercer Institute, continuing 
at the same time its academic system. Mr. Mercer was sorely disap- 
pointed at this,‘ but magnanimously accepted the decision. “TI cannot 
work alone,” was his emphatic declaration; “ I must go with my breth- 
ren;” and before the close of the year he subscribed five thousand dol- 
lars for the endowment of the Collegiate Department at Penfield. Ap- 
plication was made to the Legislature, and a charter was granted by 
that body in December, 1837,° with the usual privileges to colleges.

zAccording to Mr. Butler (History of Macon, p. 299), fifty thousand dollars were 
subscribed to this object in 1836, which amount was increased to one hundred thou- 
sand dollars during the following year. 
2 Such was the name of the proposed institution, the act incorporating it having 
been passed December 29, 1836. (Prince’s Digest, p. 879.) 
4It seems that, in addition to liberal contributions to the enterprise, he had like- 
wise tendered a beantiful situation in the suburbs of the town or Washington, as a 
home for the purposed institution.

OFFICIAL BEGINNING OF MERCER UNIVERSITY. 
Under this charter the Baptist Convention of the State of Georgia at 
its session in May, 1838, elected the first Board of Trustees of Mercer 
University.!. The first meeting of this Board was held at Penfield, in 
July of the same year, when they assumed the management of the in- 
stitution; and this date may be regarded as the official beginning of 
Mercer University, though the college classes were not organized witil 
January, 1839. Intermediately an agent had succeeded in securing the 
transfer of sixty thousand dollars cf the subscriptions which had been 
made to the college at Washington to the University, and in 1838 the 
institute assumed the title of Mercer University, in honor of its great 
promoter, the Rey. Jesse Mercer. About thesame timea town was laid 
out around the institution and named after Josiah Penfield, the founder 
of the school, who was also the donor of one of the first contributions to 
“aid in the education of poor young men preparing for the ministry.” 
Many lots were at once sold, and the proceeds were appropriated to 
build a female academy. A condition was attached to all the sales of 
lots prohibiting the keeping thereon of gambling-houses or tippling 
shops, on pain of forfeiture of title. 
In consideration of the wholesome influence which Mr. Sanders’s ad- 
ministration had exerted in the institute, and for the reason that, dur- 
ing the six years of its existence, students had been attracted to it from 
all parts of the State, twenty young men having been sent out to preach 
the Gospel, religious revivals among the students having been frequent, 
and “nearly one hundred of them,” to use Mr. Sanders’s own words, 
“having been hopefully transferred from the kingdom of darkness to 
that of light,” it was thought that no better man than Mr. Sanders 
could be selected as president of Mercer University. He was accord- 
ingly chosen, and he entered upon his duties early in January, 1839, 
His retirement from the presidential chair of the college in December 
of the same year occasioned a temporary suspension of its exercises. He 
had then held the position for almost eleven months, and under his able 
direction the infant University, like its parent, the institute, had enjoyed 
a fair measure of prosperity, ninety-five students having been in at- 
tendance during this first year of its scholastic work. 
In February of the following year Mercer University was reopened 
with one hundred and thirty-two students in the collegiate and academic 
1 The late Thomas Stocks, so long a prominent member in the Georgia Senate and 
House of Representatives, was the first president of this Board, continuing in that 
office about twenty-five years. Among the other members of the Board, twenty-seven 
in all, may be mentioned C. D. Mallary, V. R. Thornton, J. H. Campbell, Jesse Mer- 
eer, B. M, Sanders, Mark A. Cooper, Adiel Sherwood, and J. E. Dawson. The mem- 
bers of this Board were fair representatives of the Baptist denomination in Georgia 
in piety, wealth, intelligence, and in social and political influence. They gave the 
University its shape and character, and to their wise counsel, in its formative period, 
is due much of its past success,

departments. The faculty, as then constituted, embraced the Revs. 
Otis Smith, president and professor of mathematics ; Adiel Sherwood, 
professor of sacred literature and moral philosophy; Robert Tolifree, 
professor of chemistry and natural philosophy ; Albert Williams, pro- 
fessor of ancient languages; and S. P. Sanford and J. W. Attaway, as- 
sistant professors. The Convention at this time SUS five bene- 
ficiaries at the institution.' 
On the 6th of September, 1841, the Rey. Jesse Mercer, who had for 
half a century occupied a high and influential position among the Bap- 
tists of Georgia, and than whom few, if any, in the denomination could 
be remembered as exhibiting more wisdom in counsel, more profundity 
in the knowledge of divine things, more assiduity in pious labors, and 
greater liberality in his contributions to the cause of benevolence, ter- 
minated his useful and honored days. Of the influence which he exerted, 
Mr. Mallary truly and eloquently said: “It was as salutary as it was ex- 
tensive, and as pure as it was powerful. The gospel which he unfolded 
with so much skill, clearness, and heavenly unction, had exerted much 
of its transforming power upon his heart, and rendered him, character 
and life, an eminent illustration of the truth of the doctrines which he 
proclaimed.” ? 
In December, 1844, the manual labor system, which had been on 
trial since the foundation of the institute in 1833, was abandoned, hav- 
ing proved to be inefficacious.® Several other attempts had been made, 
during the same decade, to establish manual labor schools in different 
places, which, with one exception,* had likewise failed. The country 
was not yet ready for the introduction of that new feature in educa- 
tion. 
THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE CIVIL WAR. 
Mercer University continued to advance in prosperity until the com- 
mencement of the War, The Senior class cf 1861, which consisted of 
thirty-one members, was the largest ever graduated from that institu- 
tion. When the trustees met at Atlanta it was resolved by them not to 
suspend the University, but to continue its exercises for any benefit of

3“Not only unprofitable, but positively injurious,” thought Mr. Campbell. (Zbid., 
p. 155.) The Board of Trustees reported December 18, 1844, that “whereas the man- 
ual labor department of Mercer University has been gcd at a heavy expense— 
an expense which the present state of our funds will not justify, and has, in our 
judgment, materially retarded the growth of our institution * * * resolved, 
that this department be and is hereby indetinitely suspended.” (Ibid., p. 250.)

all those who might be able to prosecute their studies. At a later, 
period of the War, a resolution was adopted tendering tuition’ with- 
out charge to disabled Confederate soldiers, many of whom cra ty 
availed themselves of the kind and patriotic offer.t 
The trustees succeeded in holding a meeting in December of 1865, 
and began the rehabilitation of the University and the reorganization 
of its faculty. Three officers were appointed, who conducted the school 
until July, 1866, when two more were elected, one of whom entered on 
his duties immediately, and the other early in 1867. One of the effects 
of the War upon Mercer University was to change its location. In 1850, 
at a meeting of the Convention at Marietta, a feeble effort was made to 
move the college to Griffin. In 1857 a more determined effort at re- 
moval was made in the Convention in session at Augusta, which, how- 
ever, experienced a most decided repulse. But the War, and especially 
the redundant currency it set afloat, made men and communities more 
adventurous and speculative, and under this influence the project of 
moving the University assumed a new phase. Consequently, when the 
City Council of Macon offered one hundred and twenty-five thousand 
dollars and nine acres of choice lots in a most desirable locality of the 
town, to the University, if it would remove to that place, its directors 
‘did not hesitate in accepting the proposition. The faculty temporarily 
opened the institution in Macon, on their own responsibility, in 1870, 
and in 1871, the new charter having been perfected, the trustees resolved 
to locate the University permanently in that city, and to sustain a high 
school, under their care, at Penfield, utilizing for that purpose the 
campus and such of the buildings as might be necessary. Mercer Uni- 
versity was, accordingly, formally transferred to Macon in October, 
1871. The trustees at once proceeded to the erection of a large and 
handsome four-story brick building, containing over thirty rooms, which 
were to be devoted to the library and apparatus, and used for the pur- 
poses of recitation. They also erected a brick building as a dormitory 
and dining-hall for students. A chapel and a building to contain the 
museum and to furnish lecture-rooms were in contemplation, but the 
financial panic of 1873 caused a suspension of further proceedings. In 
his description of the institution, six years later, Mr. Butler? speaks of 
two buildings of handsome architectural style which were still to be 
erected, from which it would appear that the design of the trustees, as 
entertained in 1873, had not then been perfected. 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
The leading idea in the establishment of Mercer University, as it had 
been in the case of the institute, was to afford the advantages of a 
Christian education to the sons of Georgia, and to furnish an intellect-

ual and theological equipment to young men contemplating the gospel 
ministry. Throughout its entire career it has kept this purpose steadily 
in view. The University embraces three departments: Ist, the Ool- 
lege of Liberal Arts; 2d, the Department of Theology; 3d, the Law 
School. 
In the College of Liberal Arts, the scheme of instruction includes 
two courses of study,—the Classical (of four years) and the Scientific 
(of three years). Hach of these has a carefully arranged curriculum, 
and between them applicants have an election. Graduates in the former 
school receive the degree of bachelor of arts; in the latter, bachelor of 
science. It is to be observed that cowrses, and not individual studies, 
are elective. 
DEPARTMENT OF THEOLOGY. 
The Department of Theology, intended for the special theological in- 
struction of candidates for the ministry, has always been regarded as 
an integral part of the system. In both Mercer Institute and the Uni- 
versity a theological education was a primary thought, and was spe- 
cifically provided for in donations and legacies.! Very appropriately, 
therefore, was the Rev. Adiel Sherwood, in 1840, elected the first theo- 
logical professor. He was a clergyman of excellent classical and theo- 
logical training. Since making Georgia his permanent home, in 1818, 
he had been an active minister, had organized several churches, had 
preached very extensively, had taught a number of young ministers at 
his own house, and had been foremost in all measures for the progress of 
the Baptist denomination in the State. The actual originator of the Con- 
vention and of Mercer Institute, it was desired that he should develop 
the Theological Department of the University, which had grown, in a 
great measure, from his earnest advocacy of liberal education. But he 
remained a professor three years only, accepting a call to the presi- 
dency of Shurtleff College, in Hlinois, in 1843. In 1845 the Theologi- 
cal Department of Mercer University was more fully organized, and 
was continued until 1862. During that time seven classes, numbering 
twelve members, graduated with the degree of B. D. The course was 
quite extensive and thorough, embracing Greek, Hebrew, systematic 
and practical theology, ecclesiastical history, and Biblical literature. 
Two professors usually gave most of their time to the instruction in 
this department, and the course of study extended through three 
years.” 
For some time after the establishment of the Southern Baptist Theo- 
logical Seminary, this department lapsed into a state of suspended ani-

were in Mercer University a Central Association Theological Professorship Fund of 
$18,400; a Mercer Theological Fund of $21,500; and a new Theological Fund of $450.

mation.! But of late years a renewed demand has arisen for instrue- 
tion nearer home,’ and this school of divinity is now showing signs of 
vigorous life. The graduates in this department receive the degree of 
bachelor of divinity. 
THE LAW SCHOOL. 
The Law School was organized in 1873, with three professorships, 
viz, international and constitutional law, common and statute law, and 
equity jurisprudence, pleading, and practice. By an act of the General 
Assembly of Georgia, ““Any person having from the proper authorities 
of Mercer University in this State a diploma of graduation in the Law 
School of said University, shall be authorized to plead and practise in 
all the courts in this State, without further examination.”*? The degree 
conferred is that of bachelor of law. > 
The property of Mercer University is estimated at three hundred 
thousand dollars.t Its productive funds amount to about half that sum? 
It has excellent buildings, a library of about nine thousand volumes, a 
very fair equipment of physical and chemical apparatus, and a good 
cabinet of minerals and fossils. The central edifice is a handsome struct- 
ure. It has eight commodious recitation and lecture-rooms, with a 
private study attached to each; three library, two apparatus, and two 
cabinet rooms; two society halls,° with library; and a suite of apart- 
ments for the president. 
INFLUENCE OF MERCER UNIVERSITY. 
Mercer University has contributed to the pulpit, the bench, the halls 
of Congress, the gubernatorial office of Georgia, and to the various

$.C. Aconcentration of money and patronage on that enterprise, in order to build 
up a first-class theological seminary at the South, was deemed advisable by the 
Southern Baptists generally, in consequence of which the Theological Department 
at Mercer University remained for many years inoperative. Indeed, one of the theo- 
logical professors of Mercer, Dr. William Williams, left in 1859 to join the faculty 
at Greenville, being elected to that position. (History of the Baptist Denomination, 
ete., p. 251.)

1877, further precipitated the necessity of reopening the Mercer Theological Depart.

5The endowment of Mercer University, writes Doctor Battle, its able president, 
though not probably the largest, ranks among the largest of the endowments of 
Southern denominational institutions. Even in the inception of its career the insti- 
tution possessed what was considered a liberal endowment for the times, between 
one hundred and fifty thousand and two hundred thousand dollars having been given 
for the establishment and endowment of Mercer University and its Theological Semi- 
nary. (See Doctor Church’s speech. White’s Statistics of Georgia, p. 72.)

professions and occupations of life a number of the most distinguished, 
cultivated, aiid successful men of the day.’ It has been an efficient 
agent in elevating and strengthening the denomination under whose 
auspices it was established; while it has borne an honorable part in 
developiug an intelligent citizenship in the State. 
In its history it has had six presidents. The first who filled this office 
was the Rev. B. M. Sanders, a man of superior sagacity and of great 
force of character, who had successfully conducted Mercer Institute 
during the greater part of its career. He served the University dur- 
ing the year 1839. He was succeeded by the Rev. Otis Smith, a well- 
known educator of that day, who, after two years of service, retired at 
the close of 1842. The third president was the Rey. John L, Dagg, 
_D.D., a man of large intellect and ample acquirement, and an author 
of standard ethical and theological works. Doctor Dagg served ten 
years (1844-54). Rev. N. M. Crawford, D. D., a son of Hon. William H. 
Crawford, of national fame, was the fourth occupant of the presiden- 
tial chair. His term of office was from 1854 to 1864. He was dis- 
tinguished for an extensive and accurate scholarship, and left a deep 
impress upon the minds of the young men under his charge. The suc- 
cessor of Doctor Crawford was the Rev. Henry H. Tucker, D.D., LL. D., 
a gentleman possessing a peculiarly original genius and uncommon 
energy of character, and the author of several works, religious and 
theological. He administered the affairs of the University from 1866 
to 1871. The present able incumbent, Dr. Archibald J. Battle, D. D., 
LL. D., succeeded to the presidency in 1872, soon after the removal of 
the University to its present seat, at Macon. He is now completing 
the sixteenth year of his administration. 
The present staff of professors includes educators of culture and ex- 
perience. Itis a noteworthy fact that one of them, Shelton P. Sanford, 
LL. D., professor of pure mathematics, has oceupied his chair from the 
organization of the University, a period of forty-nine years. He is the 
author of a popular series of arithmetics and of anelementary algebra. 
These text-books are used in almost every southern State, and in some 
of the northern States. Prof. Joseph HE. Willet, LL. D., has served 
: the institution for forty-one years in his present capacity as professor 
of physical science. Among others may be mentioned the Rev. Dr. 
John J. Brantly, in the department of English, and Dr. J. G. Ryals, 
in that of theology—scholars worthy to be classed with the best edu- 
cators of the country.? Altogether there are ten instructors at Mer-

cer University, including Edgar T. Whatley, A. B., principal of its 
adjunct, Hearn Institute.’ 
HEARN INSTITUTE. 
This school is located at Cave Spring (sixteen miles from Rome), and 
its functions are to prepare students for the University classes. It is 
almost as old as the University, having been founded by the Baptists 
* of North Georgia in 1839.2 It was transferred to the State Convention 
in 1844, and a board of trustees was appointed to take charge of it. 
The school was in a highly prosperous condition in 1848, with sixty 
students in attendance. Fifty-four hundred dollars, a part of the 
Hearn legacy * of twelve thousand five hundred dollars, had been real- 
ized. The year following, the flourishing condition continued, about 
seven thousand dollars, besides its landed interests, ete., being in the 
hands of the institution. In 1850 Mr. J. 8S. Ingraham was secured as 
principal, and the school prospered. For a series of years the institu- 
tion continued to thrive under him, the attendance generally varying 
from fifty to sixty pupils. In 1855 the school was doing well in all re- 
spects. Sixty-six pupils had been received during the year, among 
whom were two young preachers, beneficiaries of the Convention. Mr. 
Ingraham continued at the head of the Hearn Manual Labor School, as 
it was then called, until the close of 1857. 
In 1863 the Hearn School and the female school at Cave Spring were 
united temporarily under the Rey. S. G. Hillyer, D. D. There were 
thirty-five students in the male department. That fall, however, it be- 
came necessary to suspend the exercises in consequence of the prox- 
imity of the contending armies. This suspension is supposed to have 
lasted until the end of the War. The buildings were much injured, and 
the library and apparatus were destroyed by the enemy. The funds of 
the school, in the hands of the trustees, were invested in Confederate 
securities and became of no value. The amount thus lost was about 
four thousand dollars. he school, however, still has twelve thousand 
dollars of the Hearn legacy in the care of the Georgia Baptist Conven- 
tion, and its landed estate consisting of some forty or fifty acres. 
In addition to the male school at Hearn Institute, a female depart- 
ment, separate from that school, was established, and was for four years 
under the successful management of Mrs. Undine B. Lane, principal. 
It was discontinued in 1887. 
The number of students in attendance at the institute during the 
scholastic year of 1887-88 was forty, which, together with the one 
hundred and forty-seven registered at coy Univ eau! for the same

SOUTHERN FEMALE COLLEGE.! 
Beside Mercer University at Macon, there are four institutions of 
higher education in Georgia which at present enjoy the support and 
patronage of the Baptist denomination.? They are the Southern Fe- 
male College, at La Grange; Monroe Female College, at Forsyth; Shor- 
ter College (female), at Rome; and the Georgia Seminary for Young 
Ladies, at Gainesville. 
We will first speak of the college at La Grange. This institution is 
one of the oldest of its kind in the United States. It was organized in 
1843, by Rev. J. E. Dawson, as a school of high order for the education 
of young ladies. Doctor Dawson, however, was quickly succeeded by 
Milton E. Bacon, A. M., whose first class of five young ladies graduated 
in 1845.3 Under Mr. Bacon’s administration‘ the college rapidly grew 
into favor, the graduating classes and the attendance on the various 
departments of instruction increasing from year to year. Large and 
beautiful buildings were erected to serve the uses of the school, and for 
the accommodation of boarders, who came in great numbers from Georgia 
and the adjoining States. President Bacon retired from office in 1855, 
and was succeeded in the position by John A. Foster, A. M., who re- 
inained in charge until 1857. 
ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT I. F, COX. 
I. F. Cox, A. M., was the next incumbent. His valued services in 
this capacity extend over a period of thirty years; and the noble record 
of usefulness which they represent the future presidents of the college

? It should be stated that about 1854 two colleges were established by the Baptists: 
one, the Cherokee Baptist College, at Cassville, in Bartow County; the other, Mar- 
shall College, in the town of Griffin, Spalding County. Both of them failed to secure 
endowments, and soon passed away. The former existed about ten years. During 
the first year of its operation seventy-six students were in attendance. Its downfall 
was hastened by the destruction by Sherman’s army in 1864 of the main college struct- 
ure, with apparatus, library, and other valuable appurtenances. (History of the 
Baptist Denomination, pp. 217-8.) 
*The alumnz of the college now number somewhat over fcur hundred. 
‘About this time the first recorded legislative incorporation occurs. By an act of 
January 31, 1850 (Laws of 1849-50, pp. 111-12), it became the La Grange Collegiate 
Seminary for Young Ladies. This name was changed two years later to that of South- 
ern and Western Female College (see act of January 14, 1852, Laws of 1851-52, pp. 
311-12). The final alteration took place in 1854, and, by act of February 17th of that 
year (Laws of 1853-54, p. 131), the institution received its present name of Southern 
Female College.

should strive to emulate. Mr, Cox has been, in the highest and truest 
sense, the friend and patron of the institution. For when, in 1863, the 
college buildings were destroyed by fire, and this calamity, with the 
financial ruin then prevalent, caused serious embarrassment, with per- 
sistent, indomitable energy he kept up the organization of the college 
despite these seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and with the re- 
turning prosperity of the country, assisted by the liberal citizens of 
La Grange, purchased the present admirable site,! and commenced the 
work of rebuilding. He erected the handsome structures now used by 
the college, and supplied the various departments,—literary, music, and 
art,—with an outfit commensurate with the demands of this age of prog- 
ress and intellectual activity. His unflagging efforts in behalf and for 
the improvement of the institution for whose weal he had pledged him- 
selfhave been crowned with their merited reward, and to day LaGrange 
stands first among many, and second to few schools for the higher edu- 
cation of females in the southern States. 
Since her husband’s death? Mrs. Cox has undertaken the management 
of the college. In association with her are her son, Prof. Charles ©. 
Cox, A. M., principal of the literary department, and a faculty of six- 
teen teachers. 
The course of instruction pursued at the Southern Female College 
consists of a primary department; a preparatory department, with first 
class, second class, and third class; and a collegiate department. The 
last gives the full four years’ course. ‘ The courses of study are adapted 
to the systematic training and proper exertion of the mental faculties. 
The aim is to blend the studies which develop and strengthen the mind 
with those which polish it, elevate and refine its tastes, and adorn the 
intellectual and moral powers with appropriate gracés.” With this end 
jn view the college has been organized into the following schools: math- 
ematics, English, Latin and Greek, modern languages, natural sciences, 
philosophy, elocution, music, and drawing and painting. An elective 
system has been introduced, by which students not desiring to take the 
regular course are enabled to concentrate their whole time and atten- 
tion upon a few subjects.’ 
, SCHOOL OF MUSIC. 
Of all the schools, that of musicis the most interesting and important, 
the most thoroughly equipped and ably taught. This department of 
the college is famous, and is believed to be hardly equalled in the South. 
The teachers who have given it such a reputation still have itin charge. 
1This was done in 1871. 
2It occurred in June, 1887, during the commencement exercises. 
*The diplomas given in the college are of two kinds: the full diploma, upon the 
completion of a course including most of the studies in the schools; and the eclectic 
diploma, upon finishing a school. 
4 There are six instructors in this department, whose separate assignments are vio- 
jin, organ, piano (advanced pupils), piano (theory), piano, voice culture (Italian 
method), and guitar,  
-P-A-G-E-81

They have made a life study of the best European conservatories and 
most distinguished artists, and are brilliant performers on more than 
one instrument. 
The very large number of pupils in music,! many of whom are excel- 
lent pianists and vocalists, attest the high appreciation of the depart- 
ment. At the State Fair in 1874 the premium of fifty dollars “ for the 
best display of musical talents by any college,” and the premium of 
twenty-five dollars ‘for the best performer on the piano-forte,” were 
awarded to La Grange pupils; and at the State Fairin 1872 they gained 
the same prizes. In 1870 the premium “for the best performer ”— 
twenty-five doliars—and fifteen dollars “for the best performer under 
twelve years of age” were also won by La Grange pupils. Five differ- 
ent scholars have taken premiums as the “best performers” on the 
piano. The college is supplied with twenty-one pianos for practice, 
most of them purchased recently, and a magnificent Steinway grand for 
concerts. 
ART DEPARTMENT. 
Another noteworthy feature in the Southern Female College is its 
drawing and painting department. This is under an artist of skill and 
experience, who has received thorough training in oil, water-colors, por- 
trait and china painting, and has studied under some of the best teach- 
ers, both North and South. Two large studios are fully equipped for 
the study of art. All due stress is laid on the importance of pupils 
learning to draw. Drawing from casts and still life is thoroughly taught, 
preparatory to painting. The only art medal is awarded for the best 
drawing. The course in crayon is especially attractive. Many fine 
portraits show the merit of this branch of instruction. Twenty were 
finished in the college in 1886. Thorough training is given in cast and 
object drawing. The “premium for the best oil painting by a pupil of 
any female college,” offered at the Atlanta Fair in 1871, was awarded 
to a pupil of this institution, as were also the premiums for the best 
drawing and the best painting in water-colors, at the State Fair in 1872. 
The college has a library of about one thousand volumes, and a museum 
which is perhaps the most complete in the State. The latter contains 
eight or nine thousand specimens representing zoblogy, botany, miner- 
alogy, and general and applied chemistry. 
The Clionian Society is the name of the young ladies’ debating club. 
It publishes a weekly paper called the Vox Clionis, one of the best col- 
lege organs in the State. 
The buildings of the Soutiiern Female College are three in number. 
The handsome edifice on the northern part of the lot contains an audi- 
ence room for the college department, and thirteen other rooms for 
music, laboratory, and recitations; while that on the south side is the 
new chapel, a large wooden building, Gothic in style, and witha lofty

roof surmounted on one of its front corners by a tower. The central 
structure is the boarding house. This is likewise comparatively new, 
and is admirably furnished for the purposes for which it is intended, 
having forty-two rooms, with halls, piazzas, and elevator. By means of 
the latter an ascent is made to the tower, which rises to the height of 
eighty-five feet, and is used as an observatory, being supplied with a 
mounted four-inch telescope, clock-work, and other appointments. 
La Grange, the seat of the institution under consideration, is situated 
in Troup County, and is an eminently healthy locality. In proof of its 
salubrity we have the statement that in twenty-eight years not a single 
death in the college occurred. We conclude with the opinion entertained 
by Rey. A. J. Battle, D. D., President of Mercer University, in regard 
tothe general excellence of the school. In a letter dated June 20, 1882, 
he says: 
“A recent visit to the Southern Female College has impressed me 
with the fact that it has no superior in the South. In all the depart- 
ments the best talent is employed, and a world of conscientious, faithful 
work is done. * * * This college boasts the finest school of music 
in the South. The concerts and other musical displays far surpass any 
school exhibition I have ever witnessed. * * * Such perfection of 
voice culture and technical skill is worthy of professional artists. 
* * * The teacher of vocalization has achieved a brilliant success 
in the admirably trained voices and artistic vocal execution of her 
pupils. She is herself a rare and charming vocalist. The fine art de- 
partment is ably directed. The works upon the walls of the college 
chapel reflect great credit upon their accomplished teacher.” 
MONROE FEMALE COLLEGE. 
By reference to White’s Historical Collections of Georgia, page 561, 
it will be seen that as early as 1849 the citizens of Forsyth, Monroe 
County, impressed with the importance of supplying better educational 
advantages for their daughters, ‘met for a consideration of the ques- 
tion.” The result was the establishment of an institution at first known 
as Forsyth Female Collegiate Institute.! A board of trustees, seven in 
number (three Methodists, three Baptists, and one Presbyterian), placed 
Rey. William C. Wilkes in charge, and under his management the col- 
lege began a career which, under different names and phases of fortune, 
has continued to the present time.” 
1See an act to incorporate the Forsyth Female Collegiate Institute, and to appoint 
trustees for the same, approved December 21, 1849. (Laws of 1849, pp. 110-11.) 
2Doctor Wilkes entered upon his duties with a determination to elevate the insti- 
tution to a rank equal to that of any in the South. He well knew the difficulties to 
be encountered; but with pradence, energy, and a full board of efficient assistants, 
the college was soon placed in a position to secure confidence and command extensive 
patronage. The annual increase of pupils was over twenty-five per cent., and after 
two years the trustees became convinced that more extensive arrangements were 
needed to meet the requirements. (White’s Historical Collections of Georgia, p. 561.)

BAPTIST INSTITUTIONS. 5 
In 1856 a change was made which affected the status of the institu- 
tion. The advantages then accruing to the town from the provision 
respecting the higher education of the daughters of its inhabitants, in- 
duced in the latter a desire for the establishment of a school of high 
grade for their sons. The subject was carefully reviewed, and the best 
method for accomplishing their purpose was discussed. The decision 
eventually reached was to accept the proposition of the Baptist mem- 
bers of the board, who offered to furnish thirty-five hundred dollars 
with which to build an institute for boys, provided a division of the 
board of trustees and of the field of labor should be so arranged as to 
leave to the control and management of the Baptists the school already 
organized for the education of girls. The thirty-five hundred dollars 
were accordingly raised and paid over. Two boards of trustees were 
organized instead of one, and a handsome edifice, known as Hilliard 
Institute, was erected one mile north of the court-house. 
The two institutions thus established moved on in their mission suc- 
cessfully until 1861. The close of the Civil War in 1865 left the South 
impoverished, its school buildings dilapidated, its social and political 
systems shattered, and the country under military rule, which gave 
promise of naught but oppression and ruin. To add to the gloominess 
of the picture, a debt hung over the Monroe Female College which the 
trustees were unable to cancel. To meet the emergencies of the case a 
combination was formed by the Rev. W. ©. Wilkes, Hon. A. D. Cand- 
ler, R. T. Asbury, and Capt. B. M. Turner, and an agreement was en- 
tered into whereby the debts of the institution were assumed, on condi- 
tion that the management, under certain limitations and restrictions, 
should be placed in their hands. Changes soon followed, new combina- 
tions were formed, and other parties became stockhelders for more than 
half the investment. In 1867 Dr. S. G. Hillyer was called to the presi- 
dency of the college, an arrangement having been made to the satisfac- 
tion of Dr. W. C. Wilkes, who until this time had presided. 
For years the affairs of the institution progressed smoothly. But 
means were wanted to furnish appliances and to give such facilities as 
were needful for success. The following plan was devised, by which 
assistance was procured for both institutions: The town council was 
authorized to sell bonds and purchase a certain amount of stock in each, 
with certain limitations and restrictions; one of the latter, as incor- 
porated in the bill, being that the organic status of the two schools 
should remain unchanged. Thus supported, the two institutions took 
on new life, and continued for years in prosperous operation. 
In the winter of 1876 Hilliard Institute was consumed by fire, and in 
October, 1879, Monroe Female College shared a similar fate. But to 
the credit of her citizens, Forsyth to-day looks upon both edifices re- 
constructed, and boasts of educational advantages possessed by very 
few towns in the State. The college has a main building with rooms 
for recitation in literature, science, music, drawing, and painting. A

nucleus has been made for a library, laboratory, museum, etc. An ex- 
cellent corps of teachers are at their respective posts.' The attendance 
of pupils is good,’ and-the institution is making rapid strides in re- 
gaining prestige and popularity. 
The first class of Monroe Female College was graduated in 1854, and 
- over two hundred young ladies have received diplomas since that time.* 
SHORTER COLLEGE.* 
This college is situated at Rome, Floyd County. In the summer of 
1873 several gentlemen of that city organized a company, and bought 
for school purposes a piece of property known as “ Shelton Hill,” located 
in the centre of the town. Prominent in this organization was Col. 
Alfred Shorter, who took fifteen shares of the stock and gave the influ- 
ence of his recognized business capacity to the enterprise. 
In October, 1873, the “Cherokee Baptist Female College” was estab- 
lished. Some changes were made in the buildings already standing on 
the premises and intended to serve the uses of the college. The neces- 
sary school furniture and instruments were supplied, and good teachers 
were secured, thus enabling the institution to afford at the beginning ex- 
cellent educational advantages. The Rev. L. R. Gwaltney was elected 
president; and was assisted by a faculty of five instructors. After 
holding the presidency a twelve-month, Doctor Gwaltney was succeed- 
ed in 1874 by Prof. A. B. Townes, of South Carolina. Upon the res- 
ignation of the latter in the following year, the institution was again 
placed under the management of Doctor Gwaltney, who remained in 
charge until his call in 1876 to the presidency of the Judson Institute, 
Marion, Ala., when Rev. R. D. Mallary, of Albany, Ga., was chosen as 
his successor. In 1877 the entire property was transferred to Col. 
Alfred Shorter,’ whose name the college now bears. He removed every 
building from the hill, and erected three large and elegané structures 
in their stead, admirably suited for school work. The main edifice con- 
tains the Memorial Chapel and thirteen rooms for college purposes, 
Another building, three stories high, is arranged for the music-rooms, 
study-hall, and art gallery; and the boarding-house constitutes the 
third. 
1 Associated with Prof. R. T. Asbury, president of the college, who fills the chair of 
mathematics, is a faculty of seven teachers.

5Rightly is the institution called after him; for he was practically its founder, 
being foremost in the movement which produced it, spending during his life-time one 
hundred and thirty thousand dollars on the grounds, buildings, and appliances, and 
leaving by will to the college forty thousand dollars as the nucleus of an endowment.

BAPTIST INSTITUTIONS. 77 
In 1882 Colonel Shorter sent to Doctor Gwaltney, requesting him to 
return to Rome and resume his office as president. This the doctor 
consented to do, and entered upon his duties in the fall of the same 
year. He is! the present incumbent, and is assisted by an able and ex- 
perienced corps of fourteen teachers. Hight supervise the literary de- 
partment, four teach music, and two instruct in art. 
The regular course of study comprehends five years, one each for the 
Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Sub-Junior, and Senior classes. There 
is likewise a preparatory department. Asin the Southern Female Col- 
lege, so in Shorter College, the various branches are arranged in schools, 
for the benefit of those who desire to specialize. There are ten of these: 
English ; history ; mental and moral philosophy ;? mathematies ; ancient 
languages ; modern languages, including French, German, and Italian; 
natural science; music; art; and art embroidery. Of all these schools, 
that of music is the most largely patronized. Out of the one hundred 
and sixty-three students in attendance on the college during the session 
of 1886-87, one hundred and forty-two were pupils of music. Instrue- 
tion in music, as here afforded, embraces the piano, organ, violin, guitar, 
and vocal culture. This and the art and natural science departments 
are well equipped with instruments, models, and apparatus. 
THE GEORGIA SEMINARY FOR YOUNG LADIES? 
This institution, situated in the town of Gainesville, Hall County, 
arose from a desire on the part of the friends of education to establish 
a large female university in Georgia. The matter was broached in the 
Georgia Baptist Convention, and a committee of twenty was appointed 
to choose a location for it. In 1877, when the Convention met at Gaines- 
ville, as that town offered twenty-five thousand dollars to aid the enter- 
prise, it was selected as the home of the institution. Work was com- 
menced on July 4, 1878, and a charter was procured for the school, 
which was opened with flattering prospects on the 11th of the Septem- 
ber following. At the time of its organization Dr. W. C. Wilkes was 
president of the faculty and Rev. D. E. Butler president of the board 
of trustees. During the first year of its existence the seminary had in 
attendance ninety-four pupils, and during the second year one hundred 
and twenty-five. There were then 1 service, we are told, a full corps 
of popular and experienced teachers, the president himself being an 
able educator. 
Doctor Wilkes continued at the head of the school until his death, 
which occurred in March, 1886, when Prof. A. W. Van Hoose, the 
present incumbent, was elected as his successor. Professor Van Hoose 
assumed control of the seminary early in September of the same year.

The session commenced with thirty-one pupils; but before its close 
in June, 1887, one hundred students had been enrolled. This number 
has, during the past year (1837-88), been increased to one hundred and 
thirty-five. In view of this rapid increase in attendance, Professor Van 
Hoose was obliged to erect another building for the accommodation of 
students. This building, a handsome three-story brick structure, con- 
tains a chapel on its first floor and school-rooms on the other two floors. 
The present faculty of this institution consists of nine teachers. In 
addition to the primary and the collegiate departments, instruction is 
afforded in law, hygiene, telegraphy, and book-keeping. Departments 
of art and music are also attached to the institution, the facilities for 
the study of music being very good. 
GEORGIA FEMALE COLLEGE.' 
We conclude our consideration of Baptist institutions with a notice 
of the Georgia Female College, which, although now discontinued, 
still, in view of past services rendered, is fairly entitled to honorable 
mention by the side of living and thriving seminaries for the advance- 
ment and development of higher female education within the borders 
of the Commonwealth. 
The college to which we here refer was located at Madison, Morgan 
County, and was incorporated by an act of the Legislature of Georgia 
on the 17th of January, 18502 At that time it was known as the 
“Madison Collegiate Institute,” but soon afterward the board of trus- 
tees, by a legislative amendment, changed the name to that of Georgia 
Female College. 
The school was founded under the auspices of the Baptists, and the 
men mainly instrumental in establishing it were residents of Madison. 
Rey. George Y. Browne was called to the presidency of the institution 
in 1850, and, entering upon his duties in the following year, ably and 
successfully conducted its operations for the space of a decade. In 1861 
he removed to Alabama, but in 1870 returned to Madison and accepted 
the position which he had formerly occupied in the college, and which 
declining health compelled him to resign in 1878. ‘As an instructor,” 
we are told, “George Y. Browne had no superior and but few equals, 
and those who enjoyed the benefit of his instruction received no super- 
ficial education.” 
Among the other presidents of the Georgia Female College may be 
mentioned the Rey. J. R. Branham, D. D.; Prof. A. B. Townes, of South 
Carolina, who heid the office for a brief period; Prof. R. T. Asbury, 
the present head of Monroe Female College, who was called to the chair 
about 1880; and Col. Edward Butler, son of the late Rev. D. E. Butler,

who was ir charge of the institution when it was burned in 1882. He 
was the last of the presidents, and the Georgia Female College is now 
but a pleasant and interesting memory, constituting no unimportant 
link in the chain of the educational history of the Commonwealth. 
In 1852 the institution had fine buildings, a large endowment, and 
was a flourishing school. Fourteen thousand dollars had been recently 
subscribed in Morgan County, which had been increased to eighteen 
thousand dollars by subscriptions from other parts of the State, for 
the completion of the buildings, purchase of apparatus, ete. The fac- 
ulty at that time consisted of twelve instructors, representing the 
branches of mental and moral science, the natural sciences, mathe- 
matics, rhetoric, belles-lettres, natural theology, physiology, French, 
Italian, Spanish, music, and drawing and painting, The whole number 
of pupils in attendance during the first session of the college (1851-52) 
was one hundred and forty-eight. ; 
In 1854 we are advised of the contemplated formation of a normal 
class, free of all tuition fees, for the benefit of those graduates who 
might desire to receive instruction in the theory and practice of teach- 
ing. One hundred and fifty-six names were enrolled on the college 
register during the preceding year, and the apparatus was reported to 
be “of the most recent and approved construction.” 
A quarter of a century elapses, and we again meet with the Georgia 
Female ‘College, this time under the efficient management of Professor 
Asbury, who then, as now, enjoyed a widely extended reputation as a 
thorough and successful teacher. He was assisted by an able corps 
of instructors. The main college building was a large and well ar- 
ranged brick edifice, situated in a beautiful grove, and presenting an 
attractive appearance. The college was supplied with fine philosophi- 
cal apparatus. 
Such is the last glimpse that we have of an institution which was 
very popular in its day, and which gratefully recognized as the foun- 
dation and chief corner-stone of its prosperity the administration of 
the Rey. George Y. Browne.

tance, is Oglethorpe University, one of the oldest chartered colleges in 
the State, and for many years a vigorous and flourishing institution. 
This University had its origin in a division of the interests of the 
Educational Society of Georgia,! at its dissolution, between the two 
manual labor schools, the Midway Seminary and the Gwinnett Institute. 
The trustees of the Midway Seminary, in the spring of 1835, tendered 
it to the Hopewell Presbytery, believing “ that ecclesiastical supervis- 
ion would give weight and permanency to the object, and secure that | 
moral and religious influence over it which, with a strict and reason- 
able discipline, would render it more worthy of support and confidence.”? 
The Presbytery accepted the offer, and appointed a committee to re- 
port on the expediency of elevating it to the rank of a college. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE. 
That committee reported at the fall meeting of the Presbytery in 
1835, through their chairman, the Hon. B. A. Nisbet, the following reso- 
lution, which was adopted: “ Resolved, That it is expedient that Hope- 
well Presbytery undertake to endow, organize, and maintain a college, 
to be under the exclusive government and control of the Presbyterian 
Church.” It was further “ Resolved unanimously, That this institution 
shall be located at Midway, Baldwin County.”* 
In pursuance of this determination, the Presbytery appointed a board 
of trustees, consisting of twenty-four members, to take charge of Ogle. 
thorpe University, as the new college was called. The first meeting of 
this board was held at Milledgeville, Ga., October 21, 1835; and just 
two months from that date the desired charter was procured from the 
General Assembly.’ This was ample in all respects. The preamble of 
the act incorporating Oglethorpe University runs as follows: “ Whereas, 
The cultivation of piety and the diffusion of useful knowledge greatly 
tend to preserve the liberty and to advance the prosperity of a free 
people; and whereas, these important objects are best obtained by train- 
ing the minds of the rising generation in the study of useful science 
1Alluding to this organization, Doctor Wilson (Necrology, p. 29) says: “The 
most important enterprise ever entered into by any e stical body in the State 
had its inception at the session of Hopewell Presbytery at Thyatira Church, in the 
spring of 1823. This was the formation of the Georgia Educational Society. Out of 
this enterprise arose the whole movement of denominational education in the State. 
To it we trace the existence of Oglethorpe University, Emory College, and Mercer 
University.” See also ibid., pp. 29-35. 
2 Professor Talmage’s sketch in Georgia Illustrated, p. 6. 
*The idea of establishing the college at Midway was an after-thought, it having at 
first been the intention of the Presbyterians to found it at Washington, in Wilkes 
County. This location was ed with reference to its healthfulness, its central 
situation, and because it was easy of access to all pupils coming from Georgia and the 
«southern States. It was near the great thoroughfare from New. Orleans to the North, 
and within a few miles of the line of the Central Railroad from Savannah to the 
West, thus bringing the seaboard and the mountains to its doors,

and imbuing their hearts with the sentiments of religion and virtue; 
and whereas, it is the duty of an enlightened and patriotic Legislature 
to authorize, protect, and foster institutions established for the promo- 
tion of these important objects: Be it enacted,” ete. One of the pro- 
visions of this charter was that ‘‘It shall not be lawful for any person 
to establish, keep, or maintain any store, or shop of any description, 
for vending any species of merchandise, groceries, or confectioneries,” 
within a mile and a half of the University, under the penalty of a sum 
not less than five hundred dollars; the form of deeds granted in the 
sale of University lots requiring the forfeiture of the lot to the Univer- 
sity when those restrictions were violated. 
THE UNIVERSITY ORGANIZED. 
On November 24, 1836, the University was organized by the election 
of the following: officers and faculty: Rev. C. P. Beman, D. D., pres- 
ident, and professor of chemistry and natural philosophy; Hon. Eu- 
genius A. Nisbet, vice-president, and professor of belles-lettres and 
mental philosophy ; Rev. Samuel K. Talmage, professor of ancient lan- 
guages; Rev. C. W. Howard,! chaplain and lecturer on moral philosophy 
and evidences of Christianity ; and N. Macon Crawford, professor of 
mathematics and astronomy. 
The corner-stone of the University was laid with appropriate cere- 
monies, and an addréss was delivered by Chief-Justice Joseph Henry 
Lumpkin, March 31,1837. The main college edifice had been commenced. 
the August before, and was completed in July, 1840. This building Pro- 
fessor Talmage, writing in 1842, thus describes: ‘It is a brick struct- 
ure, painted white, two stories high, beside a basement. It is con- 
structed after the Grecian-Doric order, without and within. The cen- 
tral part contains the finest college chapel in the United States; its 
whole dimensions are fifty-two feet front by eighty-nine feet deep, in- 
cluding a colonnade fourteen feet deep, supported by four massive pil- 
lars, and the vestibule to the chapel eleven feet deep. The dimensions 
of the chapel are forty-eight feet by sixty in the main story, and forty- 
eight by seventy-one in the gallery, the latter extending over the ves- 
tibule. The ceiling of the chapel is in the form of an elliptical arch, 
resting on a rich cornice, and containing a chaste and ornamental cen- 
tre piece. Attached to the building are two wings, thirty feet front by 
1 Doctor aware is entitled to special atic and credit irene of the fact that it 
was at his suggestion and through his personal exertions that the Midway Seminary 
was established, under the auspices and patronage, as we have seen, of the Hopewell 
Presbytery. To him likewise belongs the honor of having been instrumental in 
transforming the school into a college; of proposing the name of Oglethorpe Univer- 
sity, which the institution afterward bore; and of having raised, in one year, in 
Georgia, an endowment fund of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars. (See 
T. P. Janes’s Hand-Book of Georgia, pp. 201-2.) z

  thirty-four deep, and three stories high; making the entire front of the 
edifice one hundred and twelve feetin length. Each story in the wings 
is divided into a professor's office in front, and a recitation or lecture 
room in the rear. There are in the basement story and the wings six- 
teen rooms, affording ample accommodations, museum, apparatus, and 
all other conveniences for college purposes.” On each side of the cam- 
pus there was a row of dormitories of one story! for the habitation of 
the students. The other buildings were the president’s house, on the 
south side of the campus, below the dormitories; the academy, a large 
two-story edifice, opposite it on the north side; and an old chapel, the 
interior of which was converted into eco rooms. 
The college commenced operations in January, 1838. From that time 
the number of students gradually increased until 1842, when it amounted: 
to one hundred and twenty-five. Of these, fifty mere in the collegiate 
and seventy-five in the preparatory department.? The first class was 
graduated in the fall of 1839, 
The college year was divided into two sessions. The winter session, 
which began the collegiate year, opened on the first Monday in Janu- 
ary and closed on the second Wednesday in May. The summer ses- 
sion began four weeks after the latter date, and closed on Commence- 
ment Day, the Wednesday after the second Monday in November. 
In the fall of 1839 the Presbytery, at the request of the board of 
trustees, offered the institution to the Synod of South Carolina and 
Georgia, by whom it was unanimously accepted. 
President Beman resigned his position in 1841. In November of the 
same year the Rey. Samuel K. Talmage, a graduate of Princeton, and 
uncle of the present Dr. I. De Witt Talmage, was called to the presi- 
dency of. the college. He remained in office until his death, which 
occurred September 2, 1865. 
The exercises of Oglethorpe University were suspended toward the 
close of the War through the lack of necessary funds; and from 1867 to 
1869 the college was still struggling with financial difficulties. All at- 
tempts at reorganization had proved fruitless, and the several elections 
made had been repulsed by declinations. Finally, on October 6, 1869, 
Rev. W. M. Cunningham was chosen president. He died, however, 
before the reopening of the college, and on March 31, 1870, Dr. David 
Willis was appointed his successor. About the same time it was decided 
to remove the University to Atlanta, where its exercises were resumed 
in October, 1870, with Doctor Wills as president. After continuing its 
operations for a year or two, in 1872 the institution was closed, and has 
not since been reopened, though its organization is maintained through 
the EN of pe who meet annually in Atlanta. 
1 These were placed twelve feet apart, and each one was divided into two rooms 
eighteen feet sqnare.

The apparatus and other property have been returned to Midway, and, 
with the former buildings of the college, are used and occupied by the 
Talmage High School, which was well patronized in 1876, the propery 
being then worth twenty-five thousand dollars.! 
Recently the question of reorganizing and rehabilitating Suioneane 
University has been discussed by the Presbyterians of Georgia. Among 
the plans suggested is the purchase of some four hundred acres of land 
at Kirkwood, near Atlanta, including one of the finest groves in the 
State, as a site for the college. 
ROME FEMALE COLLEGE. 
This institution, while several years the junior of Oglethorpe Univer- 
sity, has this advantage over the latter, that it is still in active exist- 
ence. The Rome Female College is the outgrowth of the Rome Female 
Academy, which was established in 1845 by Rev. and Mrs. J. M. M. 
Caldwell. The college was incorporated and began its work in 1857 
under the auspices of the Synod of Georgia. In common with similar 
institutions under the control of that body,? it passed into private hands 
in 1862, becoming the property of its president, Doctor Caldwell. After 
seven years of great prosperity,’ the approach of contending armies in 
1864 rendered the suspension of the college a necessity. Another seven 
years elapsed before it was reopened, under the direction of its former 
president, in 1871. Since that year it has steadily grown in useful- 
ness, and has maintained its position in the front rank of institutions of 
learning. 
The present faculty of the college consists of nine instructors. One 
of them, Prof. S. C. Caldwell, has been connected with Doctor Caldwell 
in his labors for more than twenty years, and is well known in the 
South as an accomplished and successful teacher of the sciences (phys- 
ical and metaphysical) and higher mathematics. 
The course of study, as prescribed in the collegiate department, occu- 
pies five years, The classes are, respectively, the Senior, Junior, Sopho- 
more, Novian, and sub-Novian, the last named being preparatory in its 
character. Beside the collegiate, there is likewise an art and also a 
music department. The art department is fully equipped for instruc- 
    1See Janes’s Hand-Book of Georgia, p. 202. 
2Previous:to the War there were two flourishing female institutions under the care 
and management of the Synod of Georgia. One of them, located at Greensborough, 
and called the Greensborough Female College, was opened January 2, 1852. (White’s 
Historical Collections of Georgia, p. 477.) The other was situated at Griffin and 
known as the Synodical Female College. (Ibid., p. 634.) It was incorporated by act 
of January 22d of the same year. The Rev. Dr. I. §. K. Axson, of Savannah, was 
at one time connected with the former, and Rev. Carlisle P. B. Martin for some years 
associated with the latter, in the capacity of president. The Griffin Synodical Fe- 
male College was used as a hospital during the War, and was burned in 1864, 
3During the first seven years of its existence (from 1857 to 1864) Rome Female Col- 
ege had an averago attendance of one hundred and twenty-five pupils,

tion in oil, water-color, and pastel painting, crayon and pencil drawing, 
china painting, and other modes of decorative art. A fine series of 
plaster casts and models is provided for the use of the “sketch class,” 
and regular exercises in drawing from living subjects are given twice 
a week. The success achieved in this department of the college is a 
source of just pride. A bronze medal was awarded its exhibit of 
scholars’ work, consisting of fifty free-hand and crayon drawings, at 
the Paris Exposition of 1878. A number of its pupils are now teachers 
of painting and drawing in other institutions, and several have estab- 
lished profitable private studios. 
The department of instrumental and vocal music is well supplied . 
with facilities for instruction and practice, and gives general satis- 
faction. 
The college possesses a valuable collection of physical and chemical 
apparatus, a cabinet of minerals and fossils, especially rich in Georgia, 
Alabama, and Tennessee specimens, and a large and well-selected li- 
brary. 
The attendance here during the sessions of 1885-86 and 1886-87 was 
about one hundred students. This diminution in the numbers attend- 
ing has been due in large measure to the effect of the establishment of ! 
public schools in the city of Rome. 
One feature in the Rome Female College has not been touched upon. 
We refer to the noble relief which the institution has for many years 
been giving to indigent Presbyterian ministers who need help in the 
preparation of their daughters for the avocation of teachers. This 
work was commenced immediately after the War, and since that time, 
as we are informed by President Caldwell, over seventy-five daughters 
of such ministers, residing in nine different States, have received suc- 
cor. “ We have now five daughters of ministers,” he says, “ who are 
being aided. * * * The results have been eminently good, and the 
need of this kind of help is such that we do not wish to suspend it. It 
should be perpetuated ; this is one object before us.”! One of the mo- 
tives prompting the contemplated purchase of the college property by 
the citizens of Rome, for presentation to the trustees of the Synod, on 
condition that that body will at once proceed to raise funds for the en- 
Jargement, more thorough equipment, and fuller endowment of the 
school—is that the opportunities for aiding the daughters of indigent 
ministers may be increased. i

METHODIST INSTITUTIONS. 
EMORY COLLEGE.! 
In the month of December, 1836, the first and foremost Methodist col- 
leges in Georgia were chartered. The act incorporating Emory College 
passed the General Assembly on the 10th of that month, and the act 
which provided for the foundation of what is now called the Wesleyan 
Female College, at Macon, received its assent on the 23d of the same 
month. Both are denominational institutions. They are now, and 
have at all times been, conducted under the supervision and auspices 
of the North and South Georgia Conferences of the Methodist Episco- 
pal Church Sonth. Latterly the co-operative patronage of the Florida 
Conference has been added. These colleges belong to the great quar- 
tette of educational factors of which the University of Georgia and 
Mercer University are the other members, the presence and influence 
of which are generally felt and acknowledged throughout the State. 
Emory College is located in the town of Oxford, Newton County, 
though its original site was at Covington. By the first section of the 
bill establishing the college a board of seventeen trustees, consisting, 
among others, of Ignatius A. Few, Lovick Pierce, and George F. Pierce, 
was appointed to take charge of it. The first formal meeting of this 
board was held February 6, 1837, in Covington. Twelve of the mem- 
bers were present, and Mr. Few was elected president of the body. One 
of the objects of this meeting was to inspect the lands offered for the 
contemplated institution and to locate the college and campus. The 
trustees visited the lands February 7, 1837. 
At a meeting held on the 8th of the ensuing December, Ignatius A. 
Few, LL. D., was chosen president of the college, and the organization 
of the faculty was completed by the election of Archelaus H. Mitchell as 
professor of moral philosophy, “and, for the.time being, professor of 
mental philosophy and belles-lettres ;” Alexander Means? as professor

of natural sciences; George W. Lane as professor of ancient languages ; 
and Harry B, Lane as professor of mathematics and civil engineering. 
With its departments thus supplied with instructors, the institution 
was at once opened. Mr. Few soon resigned his place on account of ill 
health, and was succeeded in the presidency by the Rev. Augustus B. 
Longstreet, LL. D., who remained at the head of the college until July, 
1848, a period exceeding ten years, when he was in turn followed by the 
Rey. George F, Pierce, D. D., LL. D. Since Bishop Pierce there have 
been six presidents, viz: Alexander Means, James R. Thomas, Luther 
M. Smith, Osborn L. Smith, Atticus G. Haygood, and the present able 
incumbent, Rev. Dr. Isaac 8S. Hopkins.! 
The first class of three students was graduated from Emory College 
in 1841, From that time until the present, with the exception of one 
suspension (1862-68), the exercises of the institution have been regu- 
larly conducted. The last returns show a graduation list for the whole 
period of its existence of eight hundred and twenty-six students.2 The 
average attendance for the past few years has been two hundred stu- 
dents, and during the session of 1886-87 it was two hundred and forty- 
one.> 
The present college faculty consists of fourteen instructors. These 
conduct, in addition to an academic course of the highest grade, a com- 
mercial school, a school of telegraphy, a school of law, and a school of 
tool-craft and design. 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
The academic course of study embraces a classical course of six years 
(including the two sub-Freshman classes), and a scientific course of 
three years. Of these courses it may be remarked that Bible instruc- 
tion is an important element in both of them, that branch being pursued 
through the Junior year in the classical and for the first two years of 
the scientific course. During the last year in each course lectures on 
the evidences of Christianity are delivered. The ancient languages 
1 Since the above was put in type, Doctor Hopkins has left Emory College to become 
president of the Georgia School of Technology, at Atlanta. 
The terms of service of the presidents who have come after Bishop Pierce, who re- _ 
signed in the summer of 1854, have been as follows: Rev. Alexander Means, LL. D., 
from July, 1854, to December, 1855; Rev. J. R. Thomas, LL. D., from December, 1855, 
to July, 1867; Rev. L. M. Smith, D. D., from July, 1867, to December, 1871; Rev. O. 
L. Smith, D. D., from December, 1871, to December, 1875; Rev. A. G. Haygood, D.D , 
LL. D., from December, 1875, to December, 1884; Dr. I. 8S. Hopkins, from December, 
1884, to July, 1888. Rev. Warren A. Candler, D. D., was installed in the position of 
president in the fall of 1888. 
2 Among Emory’s graduates are Hon. L, Q. C. Lamar, Associate Justice U. 8. Supreme 
Court; Gustavus J. Orr, the late State School Commissioner of Georgia, widely rec- 
ognized and admired for his abilities and labors as an educator; and ex-Member of 
Congress Thomas Hardeman. 
* There were two hundred and fifty-five students in attendance during the session 
of 1885-86,

are studied through the Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior years. The 
modern languages are taken up in the Junior and continued in the 
Senior year. Mathematics runs through the whole of the classical 
course. The study of English and English composition receives thor- 
ough attention both in the classical and scientific courses. There is, 
moreover, a master of arts course of two years’ duration, in which the 
ancient languages, mathematics, natural science, the modern languages, 
and mental and moral science enter. Of the schools of telegraphy and 
law little need be said. The course in the latter is completed in one 
year. What is especially to be noted in the case of tbe school of teleg- 
raphy is that females as well as males are entitled to the enjoyment of 
its privileges. 
Beside the book-keeping department, which is said to be in success- 
ful operation, a school of vocal music is annexed to the institution. 
There is also special provision made for the study of Hebrew. 
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. 
The chief strength of Emory College, and the foundation of its claims 
to high repute in educational circles, centre in its Department of Tech- 
nology. This school, which is memorable as being the first successful 
attempt at introducing and popularizing manual training for youth as 
a branch of college instruction in Georgia—the other efforts in that 
direction, made at an earlier date, having proved futile,—was com- 
menced in connection with the college in October, 1834. “A small shop 
in Doctor Hopkins’s yard, containing two foot-lathes and a few tools 
(all the personal property of the doctor), was all there was to begin 
with. The need of this kind of education among our own people” (we 
quote from a writer in Dixie for September, 1887) ‘seemed to be more 
sensibly felt than ever before, so that before the close of the first year 
the friends of the institution had donated ten thousand dollars for the 
benefit of this department. The present commodious building was be- 
gun before commencement, and was finished and supplied with machin- 
ery during vacation. During this time also a competent instructor had 
been secured, so that at the opening of the next college year the De- 
partment of Technology was ready to begin its work. 
“The first year’s class—that of 1885-86, as nothing worthy of notice 
in the way of work was accomplished until the present shop was built— 
was about three times as large as was expected. During this year the 
portion of time devoted to shop-work was principally given to element- 
ary training in wood-work. Much attention was paid to mechanical 
and architectural drawing. The zeal and fondness which the boys man- 
ifested for their work and its universal popularity among students! and 
citizens convincingly assured President Hopkins of the timeliness and   
1 Some in the regular course undertook to carry on the work of this department dur- 
ing that year.
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
utility of the step he had taken, and it soon became evident that the 
founding of the school was no longer considered an experiment, but 
rather a potent and useful factor in the future education of the South.” 
The session of 1886-87 opened with a good attendance for this de- 
partment, the whole number of students being thirty-five, nearly one- 
half of whom were received during that year. The same eagerness to 
learn which characterized the students of the first year was remarked 
in those of the second. At the State fair held at Macon in the fall of 
1886, samples of work in wood and iron, and specimens of drawing from 
the Emory School of Technology, were exhibited, and a diploma was 
awarded to the department for general excellence in mechanical work. 
When it is remembered that the specimens shown on this occasion were 
the product of the first year’s labors, it will be seen upon what a sub- 
stantial and excellent basis the course of training in this department has 
from the first rested. “The object of this department is to supply to the 
country a class of citizens who shall be skilled workmen, and at the same 
time educated men. * * * Furthermore, it has been sought to em- 
body the principle that mechanical science has in itself an educative 
power of the highest possible value in the development of the percep- 
tive faculties, the taste, the judgment, and the reason.”! 
The workshop is conducted as a regular manufacturing establishment. 
Work is done under the idea that it goes into the market with other 
productions of skilled labor, and must stand or fall by its excellence and 
merit. Contracts are taken for all classes of wood and iron work, thus 
giving the stimulus of variety and gradations of work to the pupil. 
For convenience the course is divided into three years. The main 
reason for doing this is to allow for and encourage strong predilection 
for any particular branch. The first year is devoted principally to 
wood-work, embracing the use of hand tools, wood-turning, machine 
sawing, planing, and boring, cabinet-work, and pattern-making. The 
second is dedicated, for the most part, to iron-work, embracing chip- 
ping, filing, drilling, lathe and planer work, forging, etc. The third year 
is given to finer work of all classes,—finishing, tool-making, and machine 
‘construction. Mechanical drawing is taught throughout the course.” 
From-the simplest exercises the pupil is advanced as rapidly as thor- 
ough work will admit, up to the most elaborate and difficult tasks. 
By gifts from friends interested in industrial education, North and 
South, as we have seen, the facilities for practice and instruction in the 
Emory Technological School have rapidly increased, until at present 
they represent, in buildings and appliances, an investment of ten thou- 
sand dollars. The buildings consist of a new shop, built of brick, with 
engine and boiler room, and a two-story brick structure, with four 
apartments, furnishing in all a floor-space of over six thousand square 
feet. The wood and iron working departments are both adequately

supplied with apparatus, among which is a milling-machine, made in the 
department. The motive-power is a Winship engine, of twenty horse- 
power, with horizontal tubular boiler. 3 
Beside several varieties of engines, some of the school’s own design- 
ing, including a twenty horse-power automatic (Corliss) engine, which 
was recently finished for the Atlanta Constitution job office, the man- 
ufactured articles of the Technological School include brackets and 
mantels, from the simplest to the most elaborate patterns, pulpits, pew- 
ends, and indeed all classes of ornamental and useful wood-work. 
Considering the extreme youth of the department, the small begin- 
nings from which it emerged to its present state of enlarged usefulness, 
and the work it has accomplished, we cordially praise the noble and 
energetic pluck and the steady perseverance of its projector and founder, 
Doctor Hopkins." 
FREE SCHOLARSHIPS AND HELPING HALLS. 
The next subjects to be considered are the Free Scholarships and the 
Helping Halls of Emory College. Particular credit is due to the insti- 
tution for the generous hand of assistance and support it has always 
extended to those who, though lacking the requisite means, yet have 
the ambition for acquiring a collegiate education. Here we see the 
great and governing principle and the foundation virtue of this col- 
lege. It is a significant fact in its history, that since 1837 it. hashelped 
toa complete or partial course more than two thousand young men? 
The board of trustees, in July, 1874, in order to increase the benefac- 
tions of the institution, granted “ two free scholarships in the college 
classes to each presiding elder’s district in the three patronizing Con- 
ferences, namely, the North Georgia, the South Georgia, and the Flor- 
ida Conference.”, These scholarships are given to the sons of laymen 
and local preachers. Another bounty has been provided for the sons 
of itinerant preachers and pastors of churches, which is that they are 
relieved from the payment of tuition. 
The “ Helping Halls” constitute the other agency which Emory 
College has employed to benefit its students. With a view to aiding 
in obtaining collegiate education young men who were very poor, but 
desirous of learning, the college, as far back ag 1876, began, in a little 
six-room cottage, the experiment of procuring cheap board for those who 
needed it. In the fall term of that year ten young men commenced 
housekeeping in the rented house. For three years the experiment 
was conducted in the little cottage. At the end of that time these facts 
were established: (1) That cheap and good board was within the reach 
of poor boys; (2) that in health, morals, social standing among students 
and citizens, and scholarship, the Hall boys ranked with the best. 
1Since the resignation of Doctor Hopkins, the technological department has been 
discontinued.

90 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
From the beginning, including the current year, not less than four hun- 
dred young men of limited means have found in the Helping Halls the 
solution of their financial problem, and have been enabled to take a 
full or a partial college course. These Helping Halls are under the 
direct control of the president of the college. He appoints the man- 
agers and they are responsible to him. 
No small boys without guardians, or persons not needing aid, or pupils 
of bad character, are admitted to them. Three of the largest and best 
houses in the town of Oxford are used as Helping Halls. 
SENEY HALL. 
  “The college buildings are situated in a grove of oak and hickory of 
original growth, the grove embracing an area of forty acres. Of these 
buildings there are six, noteworthy among them being Seney Hall, the 
gift of Mr. George I. Seney, of Brooklyn, N. Y. There are few college 
buildings in the country so admirably constructed and so thoroughly 
furnished as Seney Hall. It is three stories high, the first and sec- 
ond floors being occupied by four lecture-rooms, and the third being 
devoted exclusively to the use of the college library. The building also 
contains eight offices and reading-rooms.! Beside the college build- 
ings are two society halls, belonging respectively to the Few (organized 
in 1839) aud Phi Gamma (organized in 1837) Literary Societies. They 
have their separate libraries, amounting in all to about five thousand 
volumes. A monthly publication of these societies, known as the Emory 
Mirror, was started in October, 187, and has been continued to the 
present time. 
While Emory College has furnished the State and country at large 
with leading men in all ranks of public and private life, the peculiar 
glory of the institution is that it makes higher education possible to 
young men of limited means?

panion, and a wife. I call education, not that which is made up of the 
shreds and patches of useless arts, but that which inculeates principles, 
polishes taste, regulates temper, cultivates reason, subdues the passions, 
directs the feelings, habituates reflection, trains to self-denial, and more 
especially, that which refers all actions, feelings, sentiments, tastes, and 
passions, to the love and fear of God.” So wrote Miss Hannah More of 
the proper scope and aims of female education, in the higher sense 
in which she understood it. These views it has been the privilege of 
a country other than England to inaugurate and apply. America, 
or rather Georgia, claims the honor of establishing the oldest char- 
tered and regularly organized college in the world for graduating 
young ladies. The institution to which we allude is the Wesleyan 
Female College at Macon. ‘The founders of this ‘mother of female col- 
leges’ (as President Bass! thinks it may justly be called) were doing a 
greater and wiser” work than they at first imagined. ‘They set in 
motion a train of influences destined to roll as faras civilization extends, 
aud to act a most important part in shaping the history of the world. ”? 
The act of incorporation for the Georgia Female College was approved 
by the General Assembly of the State December 23, 1836.5 For fif- 
teen years and more prior to that time the subject of a more liberal 
system of female education had received earnest attention and had 
been extensively discussed in Georgia. The sympathies of fathers and

was chartered about the same time, or a little before perhaps, but did not confer any 
degrees till after the Georgia Female College had conferred degrees. , The same may 
be said of Mt. Holyoke in Massachusetts, which never bore the name of college, but 
obtained charter privileges to confer degrees a little prior to our college, but I 
think it has always been called a seminary, and has not conferred degrees, or did not 
till after our college had done so. I think it a well-established fact that the Georgia 
Female College, now Wesleyan, is the first college in the world that ever conferred 
a degree upon a woman. Certainly it is the first strictly woman’s college that exer- 
cised the prerogative.” See also Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th Ed., Vol. X, p. 437;

92 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
mothers were alike enlisted in the all-absorbing question. Many of the 
latter, interested for their daughters, evinced the power of the female 
mind by the admirable communications and essays which they pub- 
lished in the gazettes throughout the State! The opinion in the Old 
World, long maintained, that the education of women should be con- 
fined to the “ mere rudiments of learning and to domestic application,” 
had prevailed in America. It was now, however, undergoing a modi- 
fication. A true appreciation and recognition of female capabilities 
were the order and inspiration of the day. 
BILL REPORTED BY HON. D. G. CAMPBELL. 
The first prominent action taken in this matter was during the ses- 
sion of the Legislature in November, 1825, when, as an accompaniment 
to the report of the Committee on Public Education and Free Schools, 
Hon. Duncan G. Campbell? offered the following: “A Bill—To be en- 
titled An act to establish a public seat of learning in this State for the 
education of females.” The preamble, because of the interest which 
gathers about it from its association with these early efforts at found- 
ing a female college, may be appropriately quoted: ‘It is the distin- 
guishing happiness of the present generation to live in an age of 
improvement and enjoy the means of ameliorating the condition of all 
classes of society. In a review of the progress of literature throughout 
the country in which we live, we are furnished with the fact that in no 
part of this vast Confederation has the education of females been the 
object of public munificence. To this class of society is intrusted the 
early instruction of both sexes, and our feelings and our principles are 
of maternal origin. How necessary, then, that a department so high 
and charged with duties sodelicate and important should early be placed 
under the regenerating hand of science and religion. These are the 
strongest safeguards, under Providence, of political security and of 
individual excellence. To direct them in their appropriate destinies is 
the grateful duty of those who wish well to the national prosperity. 
For the acquirement of solid and useful female education our sister 
States will afford but incompetent reliance. And if we were but satis- 
fied of their sufficiency, the resort would be too humiliating for the 
generous ambition of Georgia and her means of indulging it. For the 
purpose, therefore, of rescuing from comparative obseurity the fairest 
portion of our community, and of enabling them to contribute to the 
valuable store of literature, philosophy and religion,—Be it therefore 
enacted,” ete. 
It was provided in this bill that the general superintendence and 
regulation of female education throughout the State, and particularly 
of the public seat of learning established for that purpose, should be

committed and intrusted to a board of trustees, to be denominated 
“The Board of Trustees of the Female Seminary ot Georgia,” and to 
consist of fifteen males and fifteen females. There were seven other 
sections in the bill, defining the authority of the Board and making all 
necessary provisions for the permanent establishment of the institution. 
The bill passed the House, but met with strong opposition in the Senate. 
Although the Legislature declined to pass the bill, Mr. Campbell was 
generally regarded, and is still gratefully remembered, as the originator 
of the scheme which contemplated female education in Georgia. Five 
years prior to the introduction of this bill he had labored in his district 
of the State and before the General Assembly in the interest of female 
education. His object was the establishment of an institution wherein 
females could enjoy educational advantages equal to those afforded in 
male colleges. Upon his death, which occurred in July, 1828, the bar 
and the press, and the State University at Athens, rendered the highest 
tribute to his public services. In no instance did they omit to eulogize 
his efforts in behalf of female education.! 
After the death of Colonel Campbell, the interest which he had ex- 
cited ina higher standard for the education of females began to wane, 
until 1834, when, at the annual commencement of the University of 
Georgia, Daniel Chandler, Esq., delivered his memorable address upon 
female education before one of the largest and most refined audiences 
that had ever assembled in those classic halls. The address was an 
eloquent and a brilliant appeal in behalf of the intellectual capabilities 
of woman. In announcing his subject, Female Education, Mr. Chand- 
ler said: 
“Tt concerns us all. It interests the present and all coming gen- 
erations. Itis the parent of patriotic feeling, virtuous sentiment, of 
religious desire, and literary distinction. It connects time with eter- 
nity, and brings into sweet identity hope and immortality” 
After speaking of the shameful neglect with which female education 
had been treated, he continued: “But the opinion as to female inea- 
pacity is undergoing a change. The developments of the past, made 
under circumstances of peculiar neglect and oppression, are correcting 
preconceived opinions and pre-existing prejudices. Truth has flashed 
its light upon the world, and the force of its eloquence has arrested the 
attention of philosophic skeptics and moralizing metaphysicians. It   
In a eulogy published in Washington, Ga., August 9, 1828, occurs the following 
passage: 
“The Christian community mourns a support, while one star will ever shed its 
mild and tranquil light on his memory. It was that which was lighted, when, amidst 
the prejudices of the age, he called on his country to elevate the standard of female 
education, and, by ‘an enlightened female community, to add strength to the State 
and perpetuate the blessings of a free government.’ 
“Female gratitude would record this philanthropic, though unsuccessful, effort in 
indelible characters, and many a tearful eye will attest how those whom he would 
have served sorrow that his sun has descended ; that a good man has fallen.”
-P-A-G-E-106

has pointed to ancient and modern days, and rescued from oblivion’s 
wave the illustrious names of many a daring, dauntless soul, of many 
a gifted, splendid intellect.” ! 
In another place? he said: “ Give the female the same advantages 
of instruction with the male; afford her the same opportunities for im- 
provement; and she will struggle with the boldest mind for the mas- 
tery in science and in letters, and outstrip in the proud race ‘of distine- 
tion many of the favored objects of parental solicitude and legislative 
bounty.” 
This address was subsequently printed, and copies of it were distrib- 
uted throughout the State. The effect produced in Georgia by its pub- 
lication and dissemination cannot be over-estimated. It gave a new di- 
rection to the opinions and feelings of the people on the very important 
subject of femaie education, wrought a wonderful change in the minds 
of all who had ever disputed “an equality in the intellectual culture of 
the two sexes,” and contributed in some measure to the establishment 
of several colleges and institutions which have proved a great blessing 
to the State. 
  FOUNDATION OF THE GEORGIA FEMALE COLLEGE. 
Pursuant to the suggestion first advanced by Mr. Campbell, the citi- 
zens of Macon were contemplating building a seminary for females, in- 
dependent of the male academy, with grades of classes similar to a 
college course, when, in 1835, the Georgia Methodist Conference assem- 
bled in their city, and it was ascertained that that body had under con- 
sideration the foundation of a permanent and thoroughly organized in- 
stitution for the education of women. At a meeting of the citizens of 
Macon held in June of the same year, it was resol ved that a committee 
of four, consisting of Messrs. R. A. Beall, Jere Cowles, Robert Collins, 
and Henry G. Lamar, should be appointed to secure the influence of 
Revs. John Howard, Sinclair, and Tally, resident ministers in Macon 
and members of the Conference, who should represent to the Conference 
the intention of the citizens of Macon to establish a female college and 
their willingness to place it under its fostering care. A site was chosen, 
and nine thousand dollars were subscribed for the proposed college.* 
When the Conference re-assembled in January, 1836, the tender was cor- 
dially accepted, and Dr. Lovick Pierce was appointed to serve as trav- 
elling agent to collect funds to build the college and put it in operation. 
Tn this capacity he continued to act for. two years.

2TDid., p. 31. 
2 When, in 1832, the lots were laid off on the common for the putpose of sale, the five 
acres on Encampment Hill were reserved for a college or some public building. The 
citizens made an application to the City Council for a grant of the reserve for the 
Macon Female College. The Council agreed to dispose of it for twenty-five hundred 
dollars; and at a called meeting on the 8th of July, 1834, the above-mentioned sum 
was subscribed toward the college, which was afterward increased, (Butler’s History 
of Macon, p. 121.)

  METHODIST INSTITUTIONS. 95 
Doctor Pierce was from the beginning, in more senses than one, the 
unswerving friend of the institution. A trustee of the college from its 
foundation to the end of his illustrious life, proudly cherishing its memo- 
ries, and ever watchful of its best interests, he shares with his son, 
Bishop George F. Pierce, also a prominent member of the board, and 
at one time employed as its financial agent, a position in the Wesleyan’s 
annals which will always be the subject of grateful and admiring retro- 
spect.! 
The first official record of the Georgia Female College, contained in 
its charter, embraces the names of the persons appointed to act as its 
trustees. These were substantially the same as those which consti- 
tuted the Board of Emory College, viz: James O. Andrew, John W. 
Talley, Samuel K. Hodges, Lovick Pierce, Ignatius A. Few, Alexan- 
der Speer, William Arnold, Thomas Samford, William J. Parks, George 
F. Pierce, Elijah Sinclair, Henry G. Lamar, Jere Cowles, Ossian 
Gregory, Robert Collins, E. Hamilton, George Jewett, Henry Solo- 
mon, Augustus B. Longstreet, Walter T. Colquitt, James A. Nisbet, 
and Robert Augustus Beall. 
The board of trustees held many meetings, and had many interest- 
ing discussions as to the plan of the building, the ways and means of 
erecting it, the adoption of the curriculum, etc. Being pioneers, it is 
remarkable that so few mistakes were made. Two years after their or- 
ganization, thatis,in June, 1838, the trustees elected a president of the 
college and one professor, and in the following November the other 
professors and officers were chosen. The college, crowning Eneamp- 
ment Hill, since known as College Hill, was opened to the public and 
began its appropriate work January 7, 1839, with the following fac- 
ulty: Rev. G. F. Pierce, president and professor of English literature; 
Rev. W. H. Ellison, professor of mathematics; Rev. T. B. Slade, pro- 
fessor of natural science; Rev. S. Mattison, principal of preparatory 
department; B. B. Hopkins, tutor; John Euhink, professor of music; 
Miss Lord, first assistant in music; Miss Massey, second assistant in 
music; Mrs. Shelton, matron; Mrs. Kingman, department of domestic 
economy; and A. R. Freeman, steward. 
OPENING OF THE COLLEGE. 
The opening of the college, even at that time, was recognized as an 
important event in the history of the times. John ©. Butler, in his 
History of Macon, p. 298, says: 
“Tt was an occasion of great interest and deep and thrilling excite- 
ment. A large and respectable number of the citizens of Macon as- 
sembled in the college chapel to witness the opening scene. The hopes 
1In his Report to the Patronizing Conferences in December, 1886, President Bass 
suggests the propriety of erecting a handsome and commodious edifice, to be known as 
Memorial Hall, and to bear the honored and beloved names of Lovick and George F. 
Pierce, as a monument to the devoted father and son whose lives were consecrated 
to the work of education in Georgia,

and the fears of its friends, the predictions of its enemies, and the 
eager delight of the congregated pupils, all conspired to invest the serv- 
ice with an interest additional to its intrinsic importance.” 
On that day ninety young ladies enrolled their names as pupils; and 
before the termination of the tirst term the number increased to one 
hundred and sixty-eight. 
The first class of eleven graduated in 1840. Since that time! eleven 
hundred and six have received A. B. diplomas, including the class of 
forty-eight young ladies which graduated in 1887. It has been the cus- 
tom from the beginning, and until a very recent date, to confer master 
of arts degrees on graduates ten years after the receipt of their A. B. 
diplomas, and in that time more than seven hundred have been compli- 
mented with such honors. Beside these, there have been thirty-one 
graduates in the honorary first degree, eight in the honorary second de- 
gree, and fifty-nine in music. According to Mr. Butler,? who wrote in 
1879, the largest number of undergraduates for any one year was two 
hundred and forty-four (in 1863-64). The smallest was one hundred 
and four, during the session of 1843-44. The last catalogue, that for 
the year 1887-88, shows a total enrolment for the college of three hun- 
dred and twenty-six students. 
EARLY HISTORY OF THE INSTITUTION. 
Having given these figures, we proceed with the early history of the 
institution. The buildings were completed in January, 1839, at a cost of 
eighty-five thousand dollars. We have the following contemporane- 
ously published account of the Georgia Female College as it then ap- 
peared 3 
“The college is located ona commanding eminence, midway between 
the business portion of the city of Macon and the village of Vineville. 
Four acres are enclosed with a neat and handsome fence. The edifice is 
one hundred and sixty feet long by sixty wide, rising four stories high in 
the centre, with wings three stories high. The roof is flat and covered 
with tin, and surrounded by a parapet. The front view is relieved from 
the monotony of a plain surface of brick by a recess of several feet, over 
which the roof projects, supported by massive pillars. There are fifty 
rooms in the building, with a spacious dining-room attached, library 
rooms, parlors, etc. The rooms used for sleeping are usually eighteen 
feet square, with large windows, ceilings high pitch, so as to allow a full 
and healthfal volume of air. The building can accommodate with com- 
fort one hundred and twenty boarders. The view from the cupola is one 
11t is worthy of special remark that during the late war between the States the 
college was kept open, and went on regularly with its work, with the exception of 
two or three weeks when General Sherman passed by on his march to the sea, and 
of two days when General Wilson took possession of the city.

of the most picturesque to be obtained from any public edifice in the 
State. The city of Macon is spread on the plain below, with its busy 
streets alive with the signs of bustling trade. Splendid mansions are 
set upon the surrounding hills, and Vineville is seen stretching its quiet 
‘length until the pines that border its more thickly settled portions hide 
from the gaze its more retired dwellings; the mighty sweep of horizon, 
with its radius of many miles, round and round, without a break, until 
in the far distance the very heavens seemed to have leaned for rest upon 
the forest trees that tower up, young and old, in sturdy strength, as if 
glad to bear the honorable burden; the Ocmulgee, winding its current 
along, hid in the overshadowing forest, and leaving the beholder to 
trace its route by the vigorous growth that shoots heavenward from its 
fertile banks. It is a scene of beauty and grandeur, of active life, and 
of sober stillness; Art amid her manufactures and her ornaments, and 
Nature in her simplicity and repose.” 
From what has been said of the auspicious opening of the Georgia 
Female College, its well organized faculty, the large attendance of pu- 
pils, and its admirably equipped college buildings, it might be inferred 
thata career of prosperity was in store for it. But such did not prove 
to be the case. The views and plans of the trustees were too liberal for 
their age, or at least for the cramped financial condition of the times.! 
They became responsible for the salaries of professors and teachers; 
debts accumulated and creditors threatened to close the doors of the 
college. The Georgia female College was actually sold and bought at 
sheriff’s sale, and given to the Georgia Annual Conference of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church. The president and faculty resigned, but they 
were immediately elected to fill like places in the Wesleyan Female Col- 
lege, the new name given to the institution. Thus the college, without 
the loss of time inits great work, passed under a new jurisdiction, and 
set out upon a new career. The date of these occurrences was 1843, 
In December of that year a charter was granted, establishing the in- 
stitution on its present basis and under the corporate name of Wesleyan 
Female College.? 
GEORGIA FEMALE COLLEGE BECOMES THE WESLEYAN FEMALE 
COLLEGE. 
In July, 1850, a committee appointed for that purpose reported to 
the board of trustees a history of the manner in which the Georgia 
Female College changed its title and relations and became tne Wes- 
  
1Jt is stated by Mr. Butler (History of Macon, pp. 297-8) that when the college com- 
menced operations it was encumbered by a debt of twenty thousand dollars, which 
was the main source of its subsequent embarrassment.

-of Macon, Ga.,” approved December 19, 1843. (Laws of Georgia, 1843, pp. 41-3.) 
The composition of the new board, as constituted by this charter, was almost identi- 
cal with that of the old, nearly every surviving member of the old board holding his 
seat in the new.

    leyan Female College. <A part of that report, taken from the minutes 
of the board, is here presented: 
“The ree find it necessary to refer to the Georgia Female Ool- 
lege in order to arrive at facts connected with the histéry of the Wes- 
leyan Female College. The friends of education inaugurated the former 
with bright prospects, but it was found at the end of five years to be 
irretrievably bankrupt, not able to pay ten cents in the dollar. The 
most of its friends surrendered the enterprise as.an entire failure. Here 
the committee cannot refrain from mentioning the names of Rev. Sam- 
uel Anthony and William H. Ellison as having used extraordinary 
efforts to sustain the institution. They called on a particular friend, 
William Scott, Esq., of Vineville, to advise them of any means by which 
the college could be continued. Hesuggested the whole plan on which 
the Wesleyan I'emale College is now settled. After the plan was sub- 
mitted by their friend, William Scott, to Messrs. Ellison and Anthony, 
and approved by them, the friends of female education then came at 
once to its aid. 
“Mr. Elam Alexander, the original contractor for the building, hada 
mortgage on it for a large amount, and was determined to sell it as soon 
as he could legally do so. When it was ascertained that his claim could 
be bought for ten thousand dollars, the following gentlemen, with their 
own money, bought the claim and divided it into ten shares, each one 
thousand dollars, as follows: George W. Persons, William Bailey, John 
Rawls, James Dean, William H. Ellison, Ambrose Chapman, one share 
each; and James A. Everett and William Scott, two shares each. The 
mortgage was foreclosed; these gentlemen bought the property and 
became the bona jide owners of the building. The object was not to 
speculate with their money, but to advance female education. They 
tendered the college building to the trustees for what it had cost them. 
Their agent, Rev. Samuel Anthony, made labored and repeated efforts 
to raise the amount necessary to purchase the college building, bat 
was unsuccessful. There was still left unpaid between seven thou- 
sand dollars and eight thousand dollars, which the late James A. Ev- 
erett proposed to advance, on the condition that the trustees would give 
him four perpetual scholarships in the institution. The trustees ac- 
cepted the proposition, and got a title to the college buildings, which 
has been legally and correctly obtained.” 
Dr. W. H. Ellison was the second president of the Georgia Female 
College, and the first of the Wesleyan Female College. There have 
been four other presidents, viz: Drs. E. H. Myers, O. L. Smith, John 
M, Bonnell, and William C. Bass. Doctor Bass has held the office since 
1874, and also occupies the Seney chair of mental and moral science. 
The Rev. C. W. Smith, recently! deceased, was elected secretary of the 
faculty in 1852. He had been a professor in the college since 1854. At 
the time of his death he was occupying the Lovick Pierce chair of

mathematics and astronomy. Inclusive of Doctors Bass and Smith, 
the board. of instruction has, until lately, consisted of eighteen teachers, 
seven of whom were employed in teaching music. With the exception 
of four or five, these teachers are all women.! 
THE COURSES OF STUDY. 
The curriculum embraces the English, Latin, Greek, French, and 
German languages, a full course in mathematics, the natural sciences, 
mental and moral philosophy, logic, evidences of Christianity, parlia- 
mentary law, ancient and modern history, elocution, and composition.” 
The preparatory department is designed for those who are unprepared 
to enter the regular college classes, and before the pupil is admitted to 
the second or lowest class in the college, she must “‘ be able to spell well 
and to read fluently ; to write a fair hand; must have completed geog- 
raphy ; have studied some elementary English grammar; have famil- 
iarized herself with the fundamental rules of arithmetic, including 
- proportion, reduction, and decimal and vulgar fractions; and must be 
able to translate and parse simple Latin.” Beside the regular A. B. 
course, there is a post-graduate or A. M. course at the Wesleyan Female 
College, the old custom, already alluded to, of conferring degrees upon 
alumne of ten years’ standing having been abolished. This course ex- 
tends through two years, and upon its completion the A. M. diplomas 
awarded, Metaphysics and ethics, English, Latin, Greek, German, 
French, and natural science are the main studies in the post-graduate 
course. 
The instruction in music imparts a knowledge of the piano, the guitar, 
and the organ, and of voice culture and harmony. This department is 
naturally divided into two schools, the piano school and the. voeal 
school. Each school is separated into distinct grades, each grade com: 
prising a definite portion of the pupil’s progress in the school. Hach 
grade is assigned, as far as possible, to a certain teacher, who gives in- 
struction to all in that grade, so long as they continue init; thus,on 
the principle of the ‘division of labor,” securing the highest order of 
skill in the teaching of the whole course. 
All who accomplish the work as prescribed in the piano school receive 
musical diplomas. The popularity of this department of the college is 
sufficiently evinced by the fact that, of the three hundred and. twenty- 
six students in attendance on the institution during the session. of. 
1887-88, one hundred and forty-eight were pupils in instrumental music; 
and. forty-six in. special vocal, training,

well supplied with all the casts and, models necessary for successful

study. The course includes every style of drawing and painting, china 
decoration, andembroidery. A full course in art, including perspective, 
entitles the graduate in this department to an “art diploma.” 
The munificent gift of over one hundred thousand dollars by Mr. 
George I. Seney, of Brooklyn, N. Y., has enabled the trustees to make 
such additions and changes in the main coliege building as to render 
it one of the most attractive and complete edifices for educational pur- 
poses which may be found either at the North or in the South. This 
building is two hundred and forty-six feet long and eighty-five feet 
wide. It is five stories high, including the mansard roof, and is sur- 
rounded on three sides by ample upper and lower colonnades. Arcades, 
stairways, transoms over every door, and broad passages throughout 
the entire building give adequate ventilation, and the structure through- 
out has every modern convenience and comfort. The first floor con- 
tains the parlors, library room, museum, and professors’ family rooms ; 
the second and third contain the sleeping rooms of boarding pupils, 
matron, and lady teachers; and on the fourth floor are located the art 
hall, society halls, and gymnasium.! There are two other buildings 
on the college premises used as chapel, laboratory, and recitation rooms. 
  BENEVOLENCE OF MR. GEORGE I. SENEY. 
Before concluding this sketch of the history and educational work of 
the Wesleyan Female College, it is proper to add a word in recogni- 
tion of the bounty of one who has proven himself the second father of 
the institution. The building of which I have spoken is a living monu- 
ment to the liberality of George I. Seney. Independently of the sixty- 
five thousand dollars donated for the purposes of renovating, enlarging, 
and modernizing the old college edifice, Mr. Seney has appropriated five 
thousand dollars, to be equally divided between the college library and 
the scientific department and to be expended in their equipment; five 
thousand dollars for improving the grounds and furnishing the build. ' 
ing; and fifty thousand dollars to be set apart as “‘a perpetual endow- 
ment, the income from which may be employed according to the wisdom 
of the trustees.”? Of the last-mentioned sum, twenty-five thousand 
dollars have been applied by the board to endow the president’s chair, 
which is known as the “‘Seney Professorship.” By request of Mr. 
Seney, the other twenty-five thousand dollars were applied to the en- 
dowment of a chair, to be called the ‘‘ Lovick Pierce Professorship ;” 
for, as the philanthropist declared, “there is no man, North or South, 
whose character I admire more, and whose name and virtues I would 
prefer to perpetuate.” 
In all, his gifts* to the Wesleyan Female College amount to one hun-

dred and twenty-five thousand dollars—a similar sum to that received 
from him by Emory College, making a total benefaction for both insti- 
tutions of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. In appreciation of 
these gifts and of the noble Christian character of Mr. Seney, the fac- 
ulty and students of Wesleyan Female College, with the sanction and 
hearty approbation of the board of trustees, have adopted his birthday, 
which occurs on the 12th of May, as a regular college anniversary. It 
is named in the calendar “ Benefactor’s Day,” and is annually observed 
by suitable literary and musical exercises, in connection with the anni- 
versary of the literary societies. 
LA GRANGE FEMALE COLLEGE.! 
The Methodists have the largest representation in colleges of any 
religious denomination in Georgia. In addition to the two just men- 
tioned, they claim five others, viz: La Grange Female College, at La 
Grange; Georgia Methodist Female College, at Covington; Andrew 
Female College, at Cuthbert; Dalton Female College, at Dalton; and 
the Methodist College for young ladies, at Gainesville. 
First of these, in many respects, is the La Grange Female College. 
Founded in 1833, it was, in its infancy, an academy of high grade, and 
its first teacher of note was Rev. Thomas Stanley. In December, 1847, 
under the presidency of Mr. Joseph T. Montgomery, a charter was pro- 
cured, and the academy became a college.? After several years of great 
prosperity, more than two hundred girls being often in attendance,’ the 
whole college property was sold to the Georgia Annual Conference of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The trustees elected a new 
corps of competent teachers, and in September, 1857, the college began 
its distinctive work of Christian education under the presidency of 
Rey. W. G. Connor, a member of the conference. It enjoyed patronage 
from all parts of Georgia and from other States. Under the presidency ~ 
of Rev. W. A. Harris, D. D., in 1859, it took the lead of church schools 
in sending out the first resident graduate class in the South, of which 
Mrs. Alice Culler Cobb, now a successful teacher in the Wesleyan Fe- 
male College, was an honored member. 
Well established in a career of enlarged and increasing usefulness, its 
work was arrested by a disastrous fire on the 28th of March, 1860. 
The college property, consisting of a handsome building, an ample

and privileges as are usually conferred in colleges and universities. Name changed 
to La Grange Female College by act of December 26, 1851. (Laws of 1851-52, p.

3 According to Mr. White, who wrote in 1854, the college had averaged, for the six 
preceding years, two hundred and forty pupils. (Historical Collections of Georgia,

chemical and physical apparatus, a complete equipment of costly musical 
instruments, and well-selected libraries,' was then consumed. Nothing 
daunted by this calamity, the friends of the institution rallied with will- 
‘ing hearts and open purses to the work of rebuilding. Their labors 
were interrupted by the War, and it was owing to the energy and perse- 
verance of Rev. James R. Mayson, late president of the college, that 
‘the building was put in a condition to be used. In the midst of the 
general depression and business prostration consequent upon the War, 
he succeeded in raising, principally from among the citizens of La 
Grange, ten thousand dollars, with which he was enabled to complete 
the work. After several years of prosperous service, he resigned his 
position in order to return to pastoral duties. The trustees then elected 
Rev. John W. Heidt, D. D., president. The present incumbent in this 
office is Rufus W. Smith, A.M. He is assisted by a faculty of nine 
teachers. ; 
The course of study embraces a preparatory, a collegiate, a commer- 
cial, a music, and an art department. The collegiate department has 
Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior classes. It is intended to 
make the commercial department one of special utility. Book-keeping, 
commercial arithmetic, business correspondence, and penmanship are 
taught in this course. Music receives marked attention. 
The alumne of the La Grange Female College number over four 
hundred. The attendance during the session of 1886-87 consisted of 
one hundred and forty-six pupils. 
The college occupies a very fine site, in full view of majestic landscapes. 
The late Doctor Sears, agent of the Peabody Fund, said of the situation, 
that he had travelled very extensively in Europe and America, visiting 
schools and colleges, but had never seen one equal to this for beauty 
and adaptation. The grounds are nine acres in extent, and, attractive 
by nature, are diversified with terraced groves and gardens. - The main 
buildings are the college and the college home. On the second story of 
the college is the chapel, with a complement of music, art, society, and 
library rooms. This chapel “‘has been pronounced by distinguished 
visitors to be the finest audience-room in the South.”? 
The Irenian is the literary society of the La Grange Female College. 
It is accomplishing much good for the institution. 
MADISON FEMALE COLLEGE. 
This college was incorporated by an act approved by the General 
Assembly of Georgia January 26, 1850 (Laws of 1849-50, pp. 108-9). 
Mr. White, in his Historical Collections of Georgia (published in 1854), 
1Mr. White (Historical Collections of Georgia, pp. 651-2) describes the college 
building as having few equals in the South. The principal edifice was of granite, one 
hundred and twenty feet long by sixty feet wide, and four stories high. Its cost was 
thirty-five thousand dollars. The entire investment for the outfit of the college had 
been seventy-five thousand dollars.

  METHODIST INSTITUTIONS. 103 
p. 566, alludes to the college as being ‘an institution of a recent date, 
numbering, according to the last catalogue, one hundred and seventy- 
one pupils. It is well supplied with philosophical and chemical instru- 
ments. * * * The course of study embraces every useful and orna- 
mental branch.” 
The college was established by the Methodists, and held its last annual 
commencement, as the writer has been informed, in 1862. During the 
war between the States the main building of the institution subserved 
a purpose similar to that to which the Georgia Female College, likewise 
in Madison, was devoted. It was used as a hospital by the Confeder- 
ate Government, and in this capacity continued to be occupied until 
its accidental destruction. by fire, which occurred in 1864 and put an 
end to its existence. 
The first president of the Madison Female College was Rev. Lucius 
L. Wittich, an experienced educator and a preacher of considerable 
mark, The second incumbent in the position was the Rev. Joseph H. 
Echols, while the third was the Rev. James L. Pierce, a brother of the 
late Bishop Pierce, and a man of fine literary attainments—under whose 
administration the institution achieved its greatest success. The last 
named of the presidents is still in life. Fall faculties were associated 
with these officers, and among the departments represented in the ecur- 
riculum were mathematics, natural philosophy, history, chemistry, 
Latin, Greek, belles-lettres, and music. . 
The college, as has been seen, was a chartered institution, granting 
diplomas and conferring degrees. At one time Dr. W. C. Bass, now 
president of Wesleyan Female College, and Dr. W. H. Felton, of Bar- 
tow County, a distinguished and influential member of the State Legis- 
lature, were numbered among its professors. A curriculum of high 
order was in force, and the educational advantages of the school are 
said to have been excellent. Fine apparatus was provided for the chairs 
of chemistry and natural philosophy, and the department of music re- 
ceived every attention. The faculty, as a general rule, comprised some 
eight or ten members, and the annual attendance upon the Female Col- 
lege averaged about one hundred and fifty pupils.

This institution is located in the town of Covington, Newton County. 
It was first erected by the people of the place for a female school of high 
order in 1851, and called the Southern Female College.”

  was changed to Southers Masonic Female College.’ We learn from 
Janes’s Hand-Book (published in 1876) that the Grand Lodge of the State 
appointed the board of trustees for the college, of which the grand 
master was president; that it was the sole property of the fraternity, 
and was founded for the purpose of educating the female orphans of 
Masons; that it had a collegiate curriculum, and conferred a fall bae- 
calaureate degree upon its graduates. It had in 1876 an average at- 
tendance of ninety, and had graduated over three hundred and fifty up 
to that time. It was largely patronized by citizens who were not mem- 
bers of the Masonic order. 
In 1882 this institution passed into the possession of the Methodists, 
and became the Georgia Methodist Female College. Under the pres- 
ent organization Rev. John T. McLauchlin, A. M., is president. He is 
assisted by five teachers. English, mathematics, natural science, an- 
cient and modern languages, and history are studied throughout the 
college course. Instruction is also afforded in music and art. The en- 
rolment of students for 1886-87 was about one hundred and forty. é 
ANDREW FEMALE COLLEGE.” 
This school, designed for the higher education of women, was estab- 
lished about 1854.° It is located at Cuthbert, Randolph County, and 
is the property of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, Its course 
of study, covering five years, is conducted by a faculty of competent 
instructors, of whom the Rey. Howard W. Key, A. M., a ripe scholar, 
an experienced teacher, and an admirable disciplinarian, is the presi- 
dent. The grounds, several acres in extent, have been rendered more 
attractive by summer-houses, trellises, and other artificial contriv- 
ances. The main college building is in the form of a Roman cross, 
fronting one hundred feet, with spacious lecture rooms at either end, 
and enclosing in the centre a chapel, forty-five feet in width and one 
hundred and twenty-five in depth, the whole being well ventilated and 
lighted. 
There was an attendance at the college of one hundred and thirty- 
five students during the session of 1886-87. 
DALTON FEMALE COLLEGE. 
This institution was founded in 1872, and is now in the sixteenth year 
of its existence. In 1873 it received a charter, and in the following 
year graduated its first class of four members. The first president of 
the Dalton Female College was the Rev. Mr. Rogers, whose term of 
service extended over a period of seven years. He was succeeded by 
Prof. R. W. Smith, who held the position for five years. Upon the

resignation of the latter in 1885, the present incumbent, John A. Jones, 
A. M., was called to the presidency of the college. 
The college is under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
South. Its history has been a quiet, unostentatious one, yet remark- 
ably successful, considering the means at its command. 
The college building is a two-story brick structure, consisting of seven 
spacious, comfortable, and conveniently arranged school-rooms, beside 
the chapel. The college has, connected with it and located near it, a 
large and well-equipped boarding department. The whole property is 
worth about fifteen thousand dollars. 
The college curriculum, requiring from ten to twelve years for its com- 
pletion,’ is about as full and extensive as that of most of the female 
seminaries of the country. There are eight teachers in the faculty, 
three of whom superintend the music department. The alumne of the 
institution number almost one hundred. The last (1886-87) register 
showed an attendance of one hundred and eighty-two papils, one hun- 
dred and sixty-nine of whom were in the literary, fifty-three in the 
music, and twenty-nine in the art department.” 
THE METHODIST COLLEGE.’ 
This institution, which is situated at Gainesville, Hall County, having 
been chartered in April, 1831, with full college powers, was established 
for the higher education of young women. Its officers are a president, 
secretary, and faculty, supervised by an incorporated board of direc- 
tors, and visited by a special board, appointed by the North Georgia 
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, under whose 
fostering care the college is administered. 
Beside the preparatory and collegiate departments, a piano soHagls 
with Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior classes, is attached to the 
college. The art and ornamental branches, also, receive attention. In- 
clusive of the Rev. Charles B. La Hatte, A. M., president of the college, 
the present faculty consists of eight teachers. The 1885-86 catalogue 
gave the college an attendance of seventy-nine pupils. The first class 
graduated in 1883.

Gross, D. D., bishop of Savannah, to whose efforts since his consecra- 
tion in 1873 it principally o wed its origin, laid its corner-stone in May, 
1874. Soon after his entrance upon his new duties, Bishop Gross deter- 
mined to erect a college within his diocese, and was cordially aided by 
members of his own denomination and many who were not Catholics. 
The college building was commenced in the spring of 1874, and was 
completed during the following October. It was a handsome brick 
structure, one hundred and seventy-five feet in length, sixty-five in 
width, and five stories high, and cost fifty thousand dollars. On the 28th 
of February, 1876, the institution was chartered. At that time, we are 
told, it had a regular college curriculum, including classical and scien- 
tific courses. Surveying, engineering, book-keeping, and commercial 
law were taught. There was also a theological course. 
Ten professors and tutors, of whom Rev. C. P. Gaboury was presi- 
dent, constituted the faculty. The attendance during the session end- 
ing June, 1876, embraced eighty-six students. In September of the 
ensuing year the college was entirely reorganized, the Rt. Rev. Bishop 
Gross himself assuming the presidency. This position he held until 
1883,! when Rev. H. J. McNally succeeded him. The latter remained 
in office only one year; and in 1884 the last president, V. Rev. L. Bazin, 
was installed. His term of service expired with the life of the institu- 
tion, in August, 1886. a

GEORGIA. 
® GRIFFIN, FEMALE COLLEGE.! 
Griffin Female College was incorporated in 1848, organized ‘in the 
following year, and graduated its first class in 1850. Though most of 
its pupils come from Georgia, its alumne are found in many parts of the 
South. The college occupies one of the most beautiful groves in the 
city of Griffin, Spalding County. Thesystem of instruction is thorough, 
provision being made for six courses of study ; viz, primary, preparatory, 
academic, collegiate, music, and art. The school of instrumental and 
vocal music is especially fine. The college outfit consists of a library 
of fifteen hundred volumes, a fair philosophical and chemical appa- 
ratus, and a cabinet of minerals. The faculty, of which Mrs. A. C. 
Winters is at present the head, numbers four teachers. 
GEORGIA MILITARY INSTITUTE. 
The list of institutions of higher education in Georgia would be in- 
complete without a mention of the Georgia Military Institute. This 
school was located within a short distance of Marietta, Cobb County. 
Originating under the direction of Col. A. V. Brumby, and first organ- 
ized by him in 1851, its first session opened on July 10th of that year 
with only seven cadets, but the attendance swelled to twenty-eight 
before the term ended. ‘Since that time,” says Mr. White, writing in 
1854, “the number has steadily and rapidly increased at each session 
up to the present time; and now, having completed but two years of 
its history, it numbers one hundred and twenty cadets, five professors, 
and one assistant professor.”? 
At the instance of Colonel Brumby, in 1851, a joint stock company 
had been formed, and the institute chartered as a military college un-

    der the control of a board of trustees.!. The act of incorporation dates 
from December 8, 1851 (Laws of 1851-52, pp. 298-9), and it is worthy of 
note, in this connection, that it was largely to the influence and active 
intervention of Col. John Milledge and the Hon. Francis S. Bartow that 
the passage of the bill was due. At the same session an act was passed, 
entitled, “An Act to provide for the education of a certain number of 
State cadets in the Georgia Military Institute, to defray the expenses 
of the same, and for other purposes therein mentioned.”? The Legisla- 
ture likewise directed the Governor to make requisition upon the Gov- 
ernment of the United States to furnish the institute with arms and 
accoutrements. The arms were received in due course, and were, we 
are told, ‘of the most beautiful and appropriate kind for their purpose.” 
The government and discipline of the institute were strictly military. 
The course of studies was thoroughly scientific, mogelled as nearly as 
possible after that of the United States Military Aeademy at West 
Point, of which Colonel Brumby was a graduate, and was almost iden- 
tical with that of the Virginia Military Institute. A full collegiate 
curriculum was provided, in addition to those departments of study 
more immediately connected with military affairs. 
The land and buildings occupied by the school remained the property 
of Colonel Brumby and his associates until 1857, when the entire estab- 
lishment was purchased by the State, and appropriations were made 
for the erection of additional buildings and the purchase of apparatus 
for the scientific departments of instruction. -In addition to the board 
of trustees, a board of visitors was appointed at each session of the 
Legislature, whose duty it was to report to them directly upon tie affairs 
6f the institute. From this time that seminary became, in all respects, 
a State college. 
Colonel Brumby continued to fill the position of superintendent of 
the institute until 1859, when he was succeeded by Prof. F. W. Capers, 
at present a member of the faculty of Charleston (S. C.) College. The 
superintendent and commandant of the school were usually aided in 
their labors by some six or seven professors, several of them being 
graduates of West Point. Of the character of the instruction there 
afforded we have already spoken. The average attendance of students 
after the second year ranged from one hundred and fifty to two hundred. 
It appears from the annual messages of the Governor that the exer- 
cises of the institute were conducted without intermission down to 1864, 
when the battalion of cadets was placed in active service. They re-

2 See act of January 21, 1852 (Laws of 1851-52, pp. 6-8). Pursuant to the intention 
of this act, eight cadets were sent from the Congressional districts, and two from the 
State at large, the appointments being given to young men who could make proof of 
their inability to procure an education from any college where they would be forced 
to pay their expenses. :

mained in the field, faithfully, gallantly, and efficiently discharging 
their duties, until after the surrender of the southern armies, and were 
disbanded at Augusta, May 5, 1865. 
This disbandment of the battalion was a matter of necessity. Their 
guns and tents had been turned over to the State or Confederate au- 
thorities, under special order; the buildings at Marietta had been 
burned;! the apparatus, library, and furniture of the institute, which 
had been removed to Milledgeville for safe-keeping, had been destroyed 
by the United States Army; and the condition of the currency was such 
as to leave the superintendent destitute of the means of furnishing even 
the poorest subsistence. There was nothing of value remaining to the 
institute but the small tract of land near Marietta, upon which the 
buildings once stood. 
An unsuccessful effort to revive the Georgia Military Institute was 
made in 1873, when a convention of former officers and cadets was held 
at Atlanta. The meeting was largely attended, and why it failed to 
accomplish the desired results, it is difficult to say. “Perhaps,” says 
Professor Capers, who was present on that occasion, and to whom we 
have been indebted for much of the foregoing, “the formal resolutions 
demanded too much for the convention, leaving little to be done by the 
Board or the Legislature.” 
COLLEGE TEMPLE. 
This institution was founded in 1853 by Prof. M. P. Kellogg, A. M., 
and during the greater portion of its existence enjoyed a liberal pat- 
ronage throughout the United States. Located at Newnan, Coweta 
County, the object in its establishment was the higher education of 
young ladies. The first degrees conferred at College Temple were in 
1855. The class of 1876, composed of twenty-eight members, was the 
largest ever graduated from the institution. According to the 1885-86 
catalogue there were one hundred and sixty-one pupils in attendance. 
The faculty numbered eleven teachers. The course of study embraced 
primary and preparatory departments and a collegiate course. 
College Temple is now extinct. Its existence ceased when, in Janu- 
ary, 1888, President Kellogg turned over the building to the town au- 
thorities for public school purposes. 
BOWDON COLLEGE. e 
This college was founded in 1856 by Col. Charles A. MeDaniel and 
Maj. John M. Richardson. It received a charter in the following year, 
and the name of Bowdon Collegiate Institute. This appellation it bore 
until 1871, when it became the present Bowdon College. “The chief 
object of its founders,” we are told, “was to establish an institution 
of learning on the strictest principles of economy, so as to place an edu- 
eation within the reach of young men of moderate means.” ‘ This is

still the characteristic feature of the institution, * * * andthe sim- 
ple, yet neat and substantial mode of Bowdon life is now proverbial.” 
Bowdon, the seat of this college, is located in the western part of Carroll 
County, Georgia, a few miles from the Alabama line. 
Bowdon College favors the joint education of the sexes. It was one 
of the first institutions in the State to_pursue this method. In 1872 it 
opened its doors to young ladies on equal terms with young men, and. 
has found “that the advantages of co-education far exceed the disad- 
vantages; and by diligence and watchful care the evils of the system 
may be avoided.” . Sixty-five of the one hundred and. sixty-nine pupils 
in attendance during the session of 1886-87 were females, and five of 
the six members of the Senior class for that year were young women. 
Beside the collegiate or regular course of study, there is a scientific 
and also.an engineering course. These differ from the collegiate course 
in substituting for the classics French, and.a more thorough and crit- 
ical course in the natural sciences and applied mathematics. Upon 
those who complete these courses the degrees of A. B., B. S., and C. E, 
are severally. conferred. 
Rey. F. H. M. Henderson, D. D.,is president of the institution.. He 
is assisted by six teachers. 
  LUCY COBB INSTITUTE. 
In 1857 General Thomas R. R. Cobb set on foot a movement to estab- 
lish a girls’ school at Athens, in Clark County. This effort on his part 
resulted in the erection, by a stock company, of a handsome four-story 
building in one of the best neighborhoods of the city. Just as the edi- 
fice was nearing its completion, General Cobb’s favorite child, a girl of 
fourteen, died. In compliment to her memory, and in- appreciation of 
her father’s devotion, the board of trustees! named the school the Lucy 
Cobb Institute. 
The institute was opened in 1858, well furnished both in its boarding 
and literary departments. Mr. Wright, a Northern gentleman, was its 
first principal. He conducted the school very satisfactorily until the 
commencement of the Civil War, when he returned to his people, and 
was succeeded in the position by the Misses Kay and Ferris. They 
were followed by Mr. Miiller. Then Madame Sosnowski assumed charge, 
and after her, Doctor Jacobs. In 1871 Mrs. Wright? was elected prin- 
cipal. She ‘found the school in a languishing condition, the previous 
term having closed with one boarder and fourteen day scholars,” and 
“ without a curriculum or charter.” She accordingly made application

school,

bia County.

  to the trustees to have the institute chartered. They promptly ac- 
ceded to her request, and on July 6, 1872, five young ladies received 
diplomas.!| The numbers increased every year until, in 1880, the date 
of Mrs. Wright’s resignation, there was a graduating class of fifteen. 
Miss Millie Rutherford, the successor of Mrs. Wright, has since con- 
ducted the school with great success. She is assisted by a corps of. fif- 
teen teachers, several of whom hold professorial chairs in the University 
of Georgia. Prominent among the lecturers ‘were the late honored 
chancellor of the University, Rev. Dr. P. H. Mell, and Dr. A, A. Lips- 
comb, ex-chancellor of the same and emeritus prpfésson of Vanderbilt 
University (Tennessee). 
The faculty of instruction has been organized into six abelian viz, 
schools of science, languages, mathematics, music, art, and English. 
The course of study is both academic and collegiate. The former is sub- 
divided. into First Academic and Collegiate; the latter into Freshman, 
Sophomore, Junior, Senior, and Graduate classes. ‘“ Only young ladies 
holding a diploma of this school, or one of the same standard, can enter 
the Graduate class, which is intended to supplement the Senior course 
in all high schools and colleges.” The regular college course embraces 
mental and moral philosophy, ancient and modern history, Latin, mathe- 
matics, the natural sciences, physiology, general literature, and book- 
keeping. The art department is under the direction of Miss Jennie 
Smith, a graduate of the institution, and a lady of unusual attainments. 
SENEY-STOVALL CHAPEL. 
It was chiefly through the exertions of one of its alumne that the 
Lucy Cobb Institute became possessed of its beautiful chapel. In 1881 
Miss Nellie Stovall, of Athens, wrote to Mr. George I. Seney, of Brook: 
lyn, N. Y., a letter in which she represented her alma mater as an ob- 
ject worthy of his bounty. The result of this graceful appeal was the 
handsome edifice to the left of the main building, known as the “ Seney- 
Stovall Chapel.” Mr. Seney erected it at a cost of ten thousand dollars. 
He has also placed in it a large pipe organ, valued at three thousand 
dollars. The chapel is octagonal in form, is tastefully decorated within, 
and is altogether quite a gem of its sort. Another noteworthy feature 
of the institution is its boarding department. We conclude with the 
quotation of an opinion expressed by a writer in the Atlanta Constitu- 
tion of October 27, 1885, in regard to the excellence of the system which 
regulates this branch of the institute. He says: 
“T have visited and inspected the methods of most of the prominent. 
schools of this kind in this country, and never have I seen one that 
comes as near as. it does to supplying all the requirements which I con- 
sider should enter into the-organization of a school to which we are to 
intrust the care of our daughters. Itis like a perfect home, and, under 
the care of its affectionate and attentive teachers, every young lady in

attendance becomes one of a circle which partakes more of the family 
hearth-stone than of strangers bound together by the mere ties of asso- 
ciation and collegiate discipline.” 
MARTIN INSTITUTE. 
  The school now known as Martin Institute was incorporated by act 
of the Legislature, November 20, 1818, under the name of Jackson Coun- 
ty Academy.' It was afterward called the Jefferson Academy. 
In December, 1859, the charter was amended and the name changed 
to Martin Institute, in honor of its benefactor, William D. Martin, 
through whose munificence the institution had been liberally endowed? 
During the long period that has since elapsed the school has been in 
successful operation, the number of students in attendance seldom 
being less than one hundred, and often nearer two hundred. 
Prior to the Civil War several distinguished teachers were at va- 
rious times connected with this institution. Among them was Dr. 
Gustavus J. Orr, late State School Commissioner. Under him the 
present principal, Prof. John W. Glenn, and one of the teachers were 
instructed. In 1869 Professor Glenn came from the East Alabama 
Male College, took charge of the institute, and extended its influence 
to the neighboring States. 
In 1874 the charter of the Martin Institute was enlarged so as to con- 
fer upon it all the rights granted to other colleges. These rights it has 
- never exercised except in graduating classes in the female department. 
It has turned its attention unpretentiously to preparing young men 
for colleges of higher claims, if not better advantages. 
Classes of young ladies were graduated regularly until 1882, when 
Principal Glenn was called to the University of Tennessee, to take charge 
of the department of agriculture in that institution. From 1870 to 1882 
Martin Institute enjoyed a liberal patronage, the number of scholars 
ranging from one hundred and twenty to two hundred and seventy. 
About October, 1883, the old building was burned down. The pres- 
ent structure was not completed until two or three years later. Prof. 
Benjamin T. Hunter, from the Agricultural School at Cuthbert, Ga., 
became principal of the institute in 1885-86. Upon his resignation, 
in the fall of 1887, Professor Glenn resumed his old place, which he 
still retains. He is assisted by a corps of five teachers. 
The curriculum of Martin Institute is similar to that of other male 
colleges, embracing the usual English, classical, and mathematical 
studies, together with a practical course in the physical sciences and       
  1Lamar’ mpilations, p. 20. 
2See Section II of act of December 9, 1359 (Laws of 1859, pp.77-9). From the pream- 
ble of this act it appears that Mr. Martin had given by will to the trustees of the 
Jefferson Academy and their successors in office, one hundred and fifty shares of his 
stock of the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company, the preamble interpreting the 
terms “Trustees of the Jefferson Academy” as none other than the institution incor- 
porated as the Trustees of the Jackson County Academy. , |

mechanical drawing. It has also business and normal courses. The 
standard of scholarship is high, especially in the department designed 
for young ladies. In the latter case the requirements are greater than 
in most of the female colleges. * 
In Martin Institute, as originally in Jackson County Academy and 
in Jefferson Academy, there exists co-education of the sexes. By refer- 
ence to the catalogue for 1885-86, it will be perceived that of the one 
hundred and fifty-two students in attendance during that session, eighty 
were males and seventy-two were females. 
This institute is located in the town of Jefferson, the county seat of 
Jackson County, nearly midway between Athens and Gainesville. The 
situation is elevated, overlooking the town, and commanding a beauti- 
ful and extensive view of the surrounding country. 
The institute building was completed in 1886, and equipped at a cost 
of more than fifteen thousand dollars. The structure is large and im- 
posing. It is built of brick, is slate-covered, and is well arranged in its 
appointments. The first floor contains recitation rooms, with seating 
capacity for nearly three hundred students, and ample blackboard fa- 
cilities for every school purpose. <A spacious chapel, approached by 
two broad stair-ways in front and one in the rear, together with vesti- 
bule, stage, and music rooms, oceupies the entire second story. The 
building is surmounted with a belfry, provided with a sweet-toned bell 
of more than a thousand pounds’ weight, the peals of which are dis- 
tinctly heard at a distance of several miles. 
HOME SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES.' 
In the year 1865 two institutions for the higher education of young 
ladies were established in Georgia—one, which is the subject of this 
section, at Athens; the other, presently to be considered, in the city of 
Atlanta. The Home School was founded by Madame Sophie Sosnow- 
ski, a lady of German birth, of long residence in this country, and dis- 
tinguished for her high character, fine culture, and ability as a teacher. 
She came to Athens from Columbia, 8. C., whence the fortune of war 
had driven her. 
This institution was founded with a view to meet a real want felt by 
many parents in the selection of a school for their daughters, a want 
which is implied in its’ name, and which Madame Sosnowski’s long ex- 
perience had made plain to her, namely, of a school that should combine 
the advantages and discipline of a real home with those of a school for 
mental training ; one that would command the personal attention and 
influence of the principal in behalf of each pupil, and avoid the rather 
casual training and promiscuous association of a large boarding school 
or college. This school was never intended for more than a limited 
number of scholars, who might be, at all times, under the eye of the

teachers, and who, while enjoying the opportunities of more special in- 
struction, should, at the same time, form a ae circle with the princi- 
pal as its centre. 
In this point of view, the school has been very successful. The at- 
tendance has been good, and the plan of the worthy madame, the pro- 
jector and organizer of the institution, has been steadily and faithfully 
earried out. 
The Home School is under the management of Madame Sosnowski, 
assisted by her daughter, Miss Caroline Sosnowski, and an efficient 
corps of teachers. Among them are the accomplished grand-daughters 
of the principal, one of whom, Miss Ida Schaller, a thorough musician, 
having been well instructed in the Boston Conservatory of Music, has 
charge of the musical department. Excellent advantages in drawing 
and painting are afforded by Miss C. Sosnowski, who is herself a skilful 
artist. 
The school offers a full course of instruction in the English branches, 
history, French and Latin, mathematics and physics, and in drawing, 
painting, and music, both vocal and instrumental. 
ATLANTA FEMALE INSTITUTE AND COLLEGE OF MUSIC. 
  This school was organized by Mrs, J. W. Ballard, its present prin- 
cipal, in 1865, and is located at Atlanta. In 1882! it received a charter 
containing full power for conferring college diplomas. The faculty of 
instructors and lecturers, independent of the principal, number thir- 
teen, all of whom are’ specialists in their several branches. The insti- 
tute embraces a literary department, a department of modern languages, 
an art department, and a music department. 
The last mentioned department constitutes, perhaps, the greatest 
attraction of the school. Mr. Constantin Sternberg, of repute as a 
pianist, is the general musical director. Two other teachers are asso- 
ciated with him in the department. 
The course in the art department is very thorough. It embraces 
charcoal and pencil drawing from casts, still life, and nature; crayon 
portraiture ; painting in oil and water colors; china painting; silk, 
velvet, and plush painting; lustra painting; brass hammering; and all 
the decorative and ornamental branches. 
Primary, intermediate, academic, and collegiate departments are all 
represented in the general curriculum. The literary and classical train- 
ing, as afforded in the collegiate course, is excellent, French,, Latin, 
mathematics, and the natural sciences entering into and forming the 
subjects of every one of the classes. Instruction in elocution is also 
imparted. 
According to the catalogue of 1886-87, the attendance of students on 
the various schools and departments of the Atlanta Female Institute,

including the kindergarten, which has been established there, is one 
hundred and forty-six. 
The new institute building is said to be the finest in the city of At- 
lanta, and is well supplied with art,! musical, chemical, and physical 
apparatus. 
YOUNG FEMALE COLLEGE,” 
Major E. R. Young, a wealthy planter of Thomas County, died in 
1860, leaving a legacy of thirty thousand dollars to be used in the es- 
tablishment and support of an institution for the education of females, 
to be known as “ Young Female College,” and appointing seven trust- 
ees® of his own selection to carry out his wishes. His will was con- 
tested, and no decision was had upon it until 1868. 
The board of trustees organized June 23, 1866, when Mr. Thomas 
Jones was chosen president and A. H. Hansell, secretary. 
In February, 1868, the board purchased the residence of Mr. James 
Kirksey, with fifteen acres of land attached, and engaged Mr. John E, 
Baker, formerly of Liberty County, to take charge of the institution, 
which was opened that month. As soon as it could be conveniently 
done, a handsome chapel, with recitation and study rooms, was built, 
and the college entered upon a prosperous course. While changes 
have from time to time occurred in the faculty, Mr. Baker has been 
continued as its head from the beginning, giving striking evidence of 
his faithfulness and fitness for the position. He is assisted by six 
teachers. The college shows an attendance, from year to year, of over 
one hundred scholars‘ and the house of the president, who lives at the 
college, is full of boarding pupils from the adjoining sections of Georgia 
and Florida. The course of study embraces five classes; viz, First, 
Second, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior. 
Young Female College has been largely instrumental in helping to 
build up the little city of Thomasville, in which itis located. 
BUITLER FEMALE COLLEGE AND MALE INSTITUTE? 
This institution, situated in Butler, Taylor County, was organized 
under the name of “ Johnston Institute,” in the year 1872. Through 
the action of the stockholders in 1875, a charter was obtained and the 
name was changed to “ Butler F Female College and Male Institute.” The

original building, which cost about ten thousand dollars, was consumed 
by fire in 1882. It was rebuilt upon an improved plan and supplied with 
suitable furniture. In pursuance of an act of the Legislature of Geor- 
gia, the town of Butler appropriated to this college certain sums of 
money annually accruing from various sources, and in this way tuition 
has been so far reduced as to make it a comparatively free school. 
The course of instruction includes primary, preparatory, and colle- 
giate departments. In the collegiate department both classical and 
scientific courses are open for the choice of the students, Those com- 
pleting these courses receive the respective degrees of bachelor of arts 
and bachelor of science. The catalogue for 1885-86 gives the college an 
attendance for that session of ninety males and eighty-six females. 
The president of the faculty is P. E. Davant, A. M., who has three 
assistants. 
GAINESVILLE COLLEGE. 
This is likewise a co-educating school, and was regularly chartered in 
1875. Its curriculum consists of primary, kindergarten, preparatory, 
and collegiate departments. Beside the bachelor of arts or regular 
college course, there is a licentiate instruction course, which differs 
from the other only in the fact that the Senior studies are omitted. 
Music! and art receive attention in the college. The faculty is at pres- 
ent composed of four teachers, of whom R. E. Mitchell, A. B., is the 
president. The Annual Register of 1886-87 shows an attendance of 
two hundred and one pupils of both sexes. 
WEST GEORGIA AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGE. 
The West Georgia Agricultural and Mechanical College, situated in 
the town of Hamilton, Harris County, was incorporated in the fall of 
1881. In the following year efforts were made to effect a union between 
it and the University of Georgia, to the end that it might become a 
branch college of the latter. The attempt, however, failed, and the 
institution remains separate from, and in nowise connected with, the 
State University. 
Capt. John W. Dozier is at the head of the school. He has four as-_ 
sistant teachers. The course of instruction embraces primary, academ- 
ic, and collegiate departments. Music is also taught. The enrolment 
of students (male and female) for the session of 1886-87 was one hun- 
dred and six. 
The college building, comprising six study rooms, with a commodious 
chapel and an ante-room on the second floor, was completed in 1884 at 
a cost of about ten thousand dollars. 
SOUTH GEORGIA MALE AND FEMALE COLLEGE. 
The seat of this college, which was established about 1882, is at Daw-

L. Parker, A. B., being president. There are literary, music, art, and 
business departments. The literary department is divided into three 
schools, viz, primary, preparatory, and collegiate. In addition to the 
regular college classes, there is a post-graduate class. The attendance 
during 1886-87 was one hundred and six males and seventy-six females. 
OTHER COLLEGES. 
In addition to the colleges already considered may be mentioned the 
Middle Georgia College, at Jonesborough, the county seat of Clayton 
County; Washington Seminary in Atlanta, which was founded by 
Miss Lola Washington about 1878, is presided over by Mrs. Baylor 
Stewart, and numbers among its faculty Mr. Alfredo Barili, a nephew 
of the celebrated Adelina Patti, and a musician of some note; Elberton 
Female Collegiate Institute, in Elbert County; Bradwell Institute, at 
Hinesville, in Liberty County; and the Agricultural College, at Cuth- 
bert, in Randolph County, the latter at present forming a part of the 
State University at Athens.! 
BUSINESS SCHOOLS IN GEORGIA. 
Moorn’s BUSINESS UNIVERSITY.—Four principal commercial col- 
leges have been established in the State, two at Atlanta, one at Macon, 
and one at Augusta. Of these, Moore’s Business University, located in 
the city of Atlanta, is the oldest and, perhaps, the best known. Founded 
by Prof. B. F. Moore, at Savannah, Ga., in 1858, and opened in Oc- 
tober of that year, Moore’s Commercial Institute was conducted with 
marked success until the inception of the War in 1861. Its operations 
then ceased. In 1862 President Moore moved to Atlanta, where, six 
years later, viz, in October, 1868, the present institution was reopened, 
commencing its work with nine students. From that small beginning 
the school has increased so rapidly that it now numbers on its roll 
nearly four thousand graduates. About three hundred students are in 
annual attendance. “ Moore’s Business University is devoted to the ed- 
ucation of yourg and middle-aged men and women in the commercial 
. branches, and in instructing them in technical knowledge, by qualify- 
ing them for transactions of business, and the proper management of 
business affairs.” The school is a completely organized community, 
with its necessary adjuncts, banking houses, and insurance, transporta- 
tion, and other agencies. The system of teaching is eminently practical, 
and embodies an actual business training. Among the subjects em- 
braced in the curriculum are single and double entry book-keeping, 
plain and ornamental penmanship, commercial arithmetic, merchandis- 
ing, political economy, actual business, business correspondence, and 
mercantile law.   
1 The school at Cuthbert, as has been intimated above, has become once more (1889) 
a member of the State University system, and consequently falls under the general 
description of the ‘‘ Branch Colleges.”

  118 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
Macon CoMMERCIAL CoLLEGE.—This institution dates from 1881, 
Its founder was the present principal, Prof. W. McKay. “I opened 
this school,” he says,! “in connection with my own practice as a pro- 
fessional accountant, and have sought rather to give a thorough train- 
ing to a few students than a smattering to a larger number, and have 
had ample proof of the truth of my theory of conducting such schools.” 
Beside penmanship, business arithmetic, correspondence, bill-making, 
and general business routine, peculiar stress is laid upon the different 
details of book-keeping and accounts, “accounting being recognized and 
taught as a science,” and, by reason of the excellent facilities afforded, 
constituting an important department in the college. Instruction is 
also given in stenography and type-writing. A special feature of the 
Macon Commercial College is its department for the graduation of fe- 
males in book-keeping and accounts. 
The other two commercial colleges to which we have alluded are 
Osborne’s Business College, at Augusta, and Goldsmith and Sullivan’s 
School of Business, at Atlanta. The former has been in operation 
since January, 1882, and was chartered in 1886.” 
LITERARY INSTITUTIONS—THE GEORGIA HISTORICAL SOCIETY.® 
Among the institutions of higher education in the State we should 
not omit to mention one which, aside from its importance as illustrating 
- a phase in the development of the country, has exerted a truly potent 
influence in the departments of literature and original research. We 
refer to the Georgia Historical Society, at Savannah. This excellent 
organization dates from 1839. For many years previous, the need for 
some such association in the city of Savannah had been felt and ac- 
knowledged, but it was not until April, 1839, that any definite action 
was taken in regard to the subject. Then the Rev. William B. Stevens, 
Israel K. Tefft, Esq., and Dr. Richard D. Arnold addressed a circular 
to a number of gentlemen whom they thought most likely to interest 
themselves in the design, inviting them to attend a meeting for the pur- 
pose of forming an historical society. The convocation was accordingly 
held, and a society was formed. The officers “ selected to give nascent 
tone, character, and impulse to the institution,” were John McPherson

K. Preston, librarian; William Thorne Williams, Charles S. Henry, 
John ©. Nicoll, William Law, Robert M. Charlton, Alexander A. Smets, 
William Bacon Stevens, and Richard D. Arnold, directors. 
Under the guidance of these its first officers—than whom, we are as- 
sured,” from out the entire circuit of the community none more compe- 
tent or trustworthy could have been chosen—the Georgia Historical 
Society entered upon a career of usefulness. 
In December, 1839,’ the society was chartered; and its avowed object, 
as revealed in the preamble‘ of the act incorporating it, was the collec- 
tion, preservation, and diffusion of information relating to the history 
of Georgia in all its various departments. To that end its officers and 
members, with a zeal worthy of all commendation, by correspondence, 
circular, contribution, purchase, and petition, concentrated as rapidly 
as they could in the library of the institution all printed and manu- 
script matter within the range of present possibility.» “So earnest,” 
says Colonel Jones,’ “was the society in the prosecution of its mis- 
sion, and so eager to offer palpable evidence of its vitality, and to assert 
a right to honorable companionship in the sisterhood of kindred insti- 
tutions, that in the second year of its existence it printed its first volume 
of collections.” It was a valuable and interesting publication; and “it 
is not an exaggeration to affirm,” continues the same author,’ “that this 
first contribution of our cherished society will compare favorably with 
the transactions of any kindred society within the wide borders of this 
land.” The second volume, like unto the first in historical value and 
genuine interest, was given to the public two years afterward; and in 
1848 appeared part first of the third volume of the Georgia Historical 
Collections. 
As early as March, 1841, the society invited Dr. William Bacon Ste- 
vens to undertake, under its auspices, the preparation of a new and 
complete history of Georgia. Liberal aid was extended to him in the 
prosecution of this most important labor, which resulted in the publi- 
cation of two octavo volumes, one in 1847 and the other in 1859. The

author concludes his history with the adoption of the Constitution of 
1798. : 
For nearly eight years after its organization the association possessed 
no building of its own, but through the courtesy of the Savannah Library 
Society was permitted to occupy its rooms as a place of convocation. In 
1847 there occurred a practical consolidation of these institutions, and 
two years subsequently the Georgia Historical Society found a conven- 
ient abiding place in the edifice which had been erected for its accom- 
modation on Bryan Street, opposite the Bank of the State of Georgia. 
The library of the Savannah Library Society was merged into that of 
the Georgia Historical Society, and thus were the literary attractions 
of the latter enhanced by the addition of some twenty-five hundred 
volumes.! : 
Through the generosity of one of Savannah’s distinguished sons, Dr. 
James P. Screven, a liability incurred in the erection of its hall was, in 
1852, discharged, and the society liberated from debt. 
During the next few years little of special moment transpired in the 
proceedings of the society. Then ensued the Civil War, which neces- 
sitated an entire suspension of all its operations, and well-nigh put an 
end to the organization itself. 
Soon, however, after the termination of hostilities, under the encour- 
agement of its then president, the Right Rev. Stephen Elliott, D. D., 
of blessed memory, the society revived,.and entered upon a career of 
activity and usefulness. The impetus then given to its membership, 
its deliberations, and its exertions, was continued during the subse- 
quent administrations of the Hon. Edward J. Harden, Mr. George 
Wymberley-Jones De Renne, Doctor Charters, and the Hon. Henry R. 
Jackson. 
In 1871 the society published an interesting brochure, entitled An 
Authentic Account of the Origin, Mystery, and Explanation of Hon. 
Richard Henry Wilde’s Alleged Plagiarism of the Lament of the Cap- 
tive. Two years afterward, through the liberality of Mr. George Wym- 
berley Jones, the society was enabled to give to the public the third vol- 
ume of its historical collections, embracing letters from General Ogle- 
thorpe to the trustees of the colony and others, from October, 1735, to 
August, 1744; a Report of Sir James Wright to Lord Dartmouth on the 
condition of the colony, dated September 20, 1773; letters from Gov- 
ernor Sir James Wright to the Earl Dartmouth and Lord George Ger- 
main, secretaries of state for America, from August 24,1774, to Febru- 
ary 16,1782; an anniversary address of Col. Charles C. Jones, Jr., on 
Brigadier-General Count Casimir Pulaski; and an address by Dr. Rich- 
ard D. Arnold, on the Organization of the Georgia Historical Society 
and of the Savannah Library Association. 
In 1878 the society, the cost of the publication being defrayed by Mr. 
De Renne, printed the fourth volume of its Collections, consisting of

On the occasion of the celebration of the thirty-seventh anniversary

Here the society, with its twelve thousand volumes, lives and pros-

THE TELFAIR ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES.! 
Through the munificence of Miss Mary Telfair, the daughter of Gov- 
ernor Edward Telfair, the Telfair Mansion in Savannah, with all the 
furniture, fixtures, books, pictures, statuary, and works of art, was be- 
queathed to the Georgia Historical Society, to be erected into an acad- 
emy of arts and sciences. 
For the maintenance of this institution she Bequesttied: one thousand 
shares of the capital stock of the Augusta and Savannah Railroad. 
Under the auspices of the Georgia Historical Society, and in pursu- 
ance of the charitable intent of this noble woman, wonderful progress 
has been made in the erection of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 
filling its halls with works of-value, and in making it what its founder

CHAPTER VII. 
MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS.) 
  THE MEDICAL COLLEGE OF GEORGIA.! 
This institution is the oldest of its kind in the State, having been in 
active operation ever since 1829. The act establishing and incorporat- 
ing the “Medical Academy of Georgia” was approved December 20, 
1828.2 By that act a board of twenty-four trustees was appointed for 
the government of the academy, to whom, under certain conditions, the 
authority was given to confer the degree of bachelor of medicine upon 
its graduates. 
Prominent among the members of this board was Dr. Milton Antony, 
who was the soul and spirit of the movement to which the academy 
owed its origin, and who has rightly been designated as its founder. 
As early as the year 1827 Doctor Antony proposed the establishment 
of a medical school in the city of Augusta. “Such an institution pre- 
sented itself to his mind as desirable and all-important. The scheme, 
although deemed by many impracticable, seemed to him simple and 
feasible. His indomitable spirit prompted him to leave no efforts un- 
tried in the accomplishment of his favorite design; while his sanguine 
heart never dreamed of defeat. He was devotedly attached to his. pro- 
fession, in which he ever held distinguished rank. * * * His de- 
sire was to assist in the perfection of his favorite science; and, in the 
accomplishment of his ends, he regarded nothing more important than 
the proper and thorough education of its young disciples.”* 
The first meeting of the board of truste es of the Medical Academy was 
held March 2, 1829, and on May 17 of the following year, the name of

the institution having inthe meanwhile been changed,' it was regularly 
organized as the board of trustees of the Medical Institute of Georgia. 
From the Legislature of 1833 the institute received a donation of ten 
thousand dollars,? and from the City Council of Augusta five thousand 
dollars more, by guaranteeing medicines and medical services to the 
city hospital for ten years. With the fifteen thousand dollars thus 
obtained, the trustees erected “their beautiful Grecian-Doric structure 
which,” wrote one of the professors* in 1842, “while exteriorly adding 
to the beauty of the city, is, in its interior arrangements, unequalled, 
for the purposes of a medical college, by any edifice in our country.”* 
With the exception of twenty-five thousand dollars which the Legis- 
lature afterward gave the Medical College, the moneys above referred 
to constitute the only pecuniary aid from without, so far as the writer 
can learn, which this institution has ever received. Hence it may be 
said to have been, almost from its inception, self-supporting. Certain 
it is, that upon the seven thousand dollars individually contributed by 
Doctors Antony, Ford, Hoxey, Crawford, Banks, Jones, and Garvin, of 
the board of trustees in 1829, the school prior to the receipt of those 
funds mainly subsisted. 
The act by which the State, in 1833, appropriated ten thousand dollars 
“for the use and benefit of the institute,” contained a provision chang- 
ing its name’ to that which it has ever since retained, viz, The Medical 
College of Georgia. The college was organized with Doctors Antony, Ford, 
J, A. Eve, Paul F. Eve, John Dent, and L. A. Dugas in its respective 
chairs. Early in the spring of 1834 the faculty raised upon its own re- 
sponsibility the sum of ten thousand dollars, and dispatched to Europe 
one of the professors, to purchase an anatomical museum, chemical ap- 
paratus, a surgical cabinet, ete., for the use of the college. 
A second application for pecuniary aid was made by the trustees in 
1835, which was so far successful that the State generously turned over 
to the college all her interest in the premium resulting from the sale of 
the increased stock of the Bank of Augusta. This was valued at the sum 
of twenty-five thousand dollars. Thus assisted, the faculty liquidated 
every outstanding debt, and preserved a fund for contingent expenses. 
“Jn the session of 1833-34 the class in attendance amounted to 
thirty, and at the second commencement the degree of M. D. was con-

titled and known as “The Medical Institute of the State of Georgia.” (See Dawson’s

ferred upon fifteen approved candidates. In the class of 1834-35 
were thirty-seven students and fifteen graduates. In 1835-36, from 
extraordinary circumstances, the number of students was but thirty-one, 
with eight graduates. In’ the following winter the attendance was in- 
creased to forty-four, while fifteen graduates received the degree of 
M. D. 
“The class of 1837-38 numbered forty-one, and thirteen were grad- 
uated. During the session of the following year the number of stu- 
dents amounted to sixty, with twelve graduates. 
“The college was now fairly established among the many similar and 
rival institutions of the country; and with but twelve graduates out of 
a class of sixty, there was every prospect of a large increase for the next 
session. But, alas! disappointment came from a quarter least of all ex- 
pected. A fatal epidemic visited the city, for the first time, and all 
hope and enterprise sank under its withering influence. Among the 
victims of the terrible disease the institution had to mourn the death 
of its beloved and distinguished founder. Dr. Milton Antony fell a 
martyr to the cause of humanity and his professional zeal, on the 19th 
of September, 1839.1. When the period arrived for commencing the 
session of 1839-40, but two professors were able to discharge their 
duties. In consequence it was found necessary to postpone the course 
of lectures two weeks, and even then the exercises began with but four 
professors. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, the institution nobly 
sustained itself. The class that year numbered fifty-four students, and 
in the spring following eighteen were graduated.”? 
The session of 1841-42 noted an increase of nineteen over the at- 
tendance of the preceding year. The number of graduates from the 
institution has multiplied proportionately with the students annually 
enrolled, until now’ it has one thousand six hundred and fifty-three 
alumni. 
ADMINISTRATION OF DR. PAUL F. EVE. 
Dr. Paul F. Eve became dean of the Medical College about the year 
1842, being the successor to Doctor Garvin, the first incumbent. Under 
his wise rule the college passed through its most successful period. 
Never since has it enjoyed that high degree of prosperity to which it 
then attained. Indeed, Doctor Eve’s administration is admiringly re- 
ferred to as exhibiting, and as being inseparably associated with, the 
college in its prime. ; 
Since Doctor Eve, six or seven persons have held the position of dean

were conferred.

of the faculty, the present incumbent being Dr. Edward Geddings, who 
entered upon the discharge of his duties in 1883. 
The exercises of the college progressed without interruption until 
1863, when, in consequence of the distractions of the Civil War, a sus- 
pension occurred which lasted until February 24, 1866. With this ex- 
ception the sessions of the college since its inception have been con- 
tinuous. 
A DEPARTMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA. 
In 1873 the Medical College became a department of the University 
of Georgia, and since that time the chancellor has attended its com- 
mencements, and in the name of the University has conferred the de- 
grees. 
This direct association with the University of Georgia, and this change 
in the auspices under which the degrees are conferred, was suggested 
and favorably considered as long ago as 1856.1 
The college building is commodious, well located, and provided with 
every appliance requisite for the facile study of medicine, chemistry, 
pathology, surgery, etc. i 
Here will be found the finest chemical and physical laboratory in the 
State outside of the University at Athens. 
It has also a library of five thousand volumes, a convenient dissecting 
hall,? and a valuable anatomical museum. The latter, occupying an 
entire third of the second story, contains many pathological specimens 
(tumors, foetuses, foetal abnormalities, ete.), the accumulations of years, 
and the most admirable selections of preparations showing the different 
stages of the eruptive fevers, contagious diseases, phlegmons, ete., in 
the South. 
The City Hospital, located on the college grounds, and the Freed- 
man’s Hospital, situated at no great distance, both under the immedi- 
ate control and support of the faculty, offer excellent facilities for 
clinical instruction. The peculiar advantages of Augusta as a great 
railroad and manufacturing centre, embracing many thousand opera- 
tives and their families, enable the Medical College to draw large num- 
bers of interesting cases to its polyclinic for treatment in the presence of 
the students, who often take charge of the cases and treat them under 
the direction of the clinical instructor. These clinics are held daily at 
the college or hospital. 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
The lectures in the Medical College of Georgia embrace anatomy, 
physiology, chemistry, materia medica and therapeutics, theory and 
practice of medicine, pathology, surgery, Obstetrics and gynecology,

2“Ample material and every facility for dissecting are offered in a hall well adapted 
to the purpose,” says the 1886-87 catalogue, p. 6,

medical jurisprudence, ophthalmology, otology, and pharmacy. There 
are eight professors representing the several branches. Prominent 
among them is Dr. Henry F. Campbell, who has charge of the depart- 
ments of surgery and gynecology. Beside his noteworthiness as a 
gynecologist, Doctor Campbell is also a man of national reputation, 
having recently filled the presidency of the Medical Association of 
America.! With these professors two demonstrators and four clinical 
assistants are associated. 
A candidate for the degree of doctor of medicine must have attended 
two full courses of lectures in this or some other college in good stand- 
ing, and pass a satisfactory examination on all branches taught in the 
institution.? In addition to the regular course of two sessions,’ the 
faculty offers and strongly recommends to the student a graded course 
of three terms. In this course the student is examined on anatomy, 
physiology, and chemistry at the expiration of the first term, and on 
such of the remaining branches as he may elect at the end of the second, 
completing his examination and graduating at the end of the third. 
As has been already seen, the Medical College is one of the par- 
ticipants in the Charles McDonald Brown Scholarship Fund. An- 
other assistance which the institution affords to poor students operates 
through its beneficiary system. In compliance with its charter, two 
students from each Congressional district of Georgia are admitted to 
the enjoyment of its privileges gratuitously. All applicants, on their 
part, are required to state on honor that they are unable, alone or with 
the aid of friends, to pay their tuition fees. They are also required to 
furnish the customary certificate from their county as to moral character 
and fitness. 
THE SAVANNAH MEDICAL COLLEGE.‘ 
  This institution belongs now to the past. While its corporate ex- 
istence relates back to a period almost contemporaneous with the founda- 
tion of the Medical College of Georgia, its career of usefulness did not, 
in duration, transcend a quarter of a century. 
A charter to establish and incorporate a medical college in the city of 
Savannah was granted in 1838 ;° but no active measures were taken to 
erect a building until 1852, when J. Gordon Howard, M. D., took the 
initiatory steps to that end, and Drs. P. M. Kollock, R. D. Arnold, W. 
G. Bulloch, C. W. West, H. L. Byrd, E. H. Martin, J. Gordon Howard, 
1Doctor Campbell is a graduate of the | college, having received his diploma in

and J. B. Read petitioned the trustees to organize them into a faculty. 
They pledged themselves to erect a suitable structure, and to provide 
all apparatus necessary for medical instruction and illustration. 
Owing to the opposition of a number of medical gentlemen, the de- 
sired privileges were withheld. Nothing daunted, however, the above- 
named physicians associated themselves together as a corporation under 
the name of the Savannah Medical Institute, and erected a college build- 
ing, the corner-stone of which was laid by Dr. R. D. Arnold in January, 
1853. In the following November the first course of lectures was de- 
livered. During the session of 1856-57 there were twenty-seven stu- 
dents in attendance upon the Savannah Medical College, as the insti- 
tution was then called, nine of whom received diplomas at its close. 
At that time the faculty, inclusive of a demonstrator of anatomy, 
numbered eight professors. Prominent among the instructors and lect- 
urers were Dr. Richard D. Arnold, professor of theory and practice of 
medicine,' and Dr. Joseph Jones, now of New Orleans, who had charge 
of the department of medical chemistry. The former, as has been seen, 
was intimately connected with the organization of the college. The lat- 
ter, Doctor Jones, through his writings and discoveries, is well known 
to the scientific world, and is distinguished as a chemist, an original in- © 
vestigator, and a physician. 
The exercises of the Savannah Medical College were interrupted by 
the War. The suspension thus occasioned continued until 1866. In 
that year the college was reopened, and its operations were conducted 
as well as the impoverished condition of its resources? would allow. 
But after struggling on for a period of some fourteen years, the doors of 
the institution were permanently closed to students about 1880. 
THE GEORGIA COLLEGE OF ECLECTIC MEDICINE AND SURGERY.? 
There are three medical colleges located at Atlanta. The first of 
them which we will consider is the Georgia College of Eclectic Medi- 
cine and Surgery. This institution was chartered by an act passed by 
the General Assembly of the State of Georgia in 1839. It was at first 
located at Forsyth, Monroe County, and was known as the Southern 
Botanico-Medical College. In 1846 it was removed to Macon, and   
* Doctor Arnold remained in this chair, reflecting honor on himself and the college 
of which he was one of the chief ornaments, until his death, which occurred about 1872. 
3 After the capture of Savannah, in 1864, the college building was used as a United 
States hospital, and from it the Federal troops carried off the fine apparatus, the 
valuable collections of minerals, the engravings and paintings for illustration, the 
anatomical preparations, and the pathological specimens which belonged to it. 
’Sixth Annual Report of the State Board of Health of Illinois. Appendix A: Con- 
spectus of the Medical Colleges of America, pp. 19-21. 
+The preamble of the act incorporating this college, approved December 11, 1839 
(Laws of 1839, pp. 134-6), recites that “Whereas the friends of the Botanic (commonly 
called the Thomsonian) System of Medical Practice in the Southern States are de- 
sirous of establishing a medical college at the town of Forsyth, Monroe County, in 
‘which the doctrines they advocate may be scientifically taught, together with the

its name was changed 'to the Reform Medical College of Georgia. At 
Macon, previous to the war between the States, the career of the col- 
lege was successful, graduating hundreds of physicians. Later,? the 
title of the institution was altered to College of American Medicine 
and Surgery.’ In pursuance of the provisions of an act of the Legis- 
lature, in 1880 the college was transferred to Atlanta; and in 1884 the 
College of American Medicine and Surgery, and the Georgia Eclectic 
Medical College, which was partly conducted by professors who had 
been connected with the College of American Medicine and Surgery 
in Macon, were united under the original charter. The name of the 
institution was once more changed by the General Assembly of Georgia 
to the Georgia College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery. This name 
it still retains. A 
The course consists of didactic and clinical lectures, practical demon- 
strations—anatomical and chemical—and recitations, coupled with the 
presentation and defence of theses by the students. The subjects em- 
braced in the lectures are anatomy, physiology and hygiene, principles 
and practice of medicine, obstetrics and diseases of women and children, 
chemistry and toxicology, surgery, materia medica and therapeutics, 
pathology and medical jurisprudence, and clinical surgery and urine 
analysis. A two years’ study of these branches is required before the 
students are allowed to graduate. In this respect the institution corre- 
sponds with the medical college at Augusta. The faculty of this col- 
lege likewise recommends a three years’ graded course after the usual 
studies have been completed. 
The college building offers comfortable accommodation to three hun- 
dred students ; and, beside containing a general lecture-room, a chemical 
lecture-room, and a laboratory where general pharmacy and a course of 
toxicology are united with chemistry, is said to have a good museum of 
pathological and other specimens, and a fairly complete physico-chemical 
apparatus.   
usual branches taught in other medical institutions; and whereas the friends of such 
a college have already subscribed liberally, in money and property, in aid of said 
object: Be it therefore enacted,” etc. : 
iThis was done in 1854. The college had then been for thirteen years in active 
operation, haviug graduated its first class in 1841. In 1852 the State Legislature ap- 
propriated five thousand dollars to enable the board of trustees to erect a building, 
procure apparatus, etc., for the college. (White’s Historical Collections of Georgia, 
p. 269.) 
2Viz, in 1874. Classes had been graduated every year until 1861. Operations were 
suspended during the Civil War, but were resumed in 1867. Students were graduated 
in 1868, and in each subsequent year until 1874, when the college changed its name. 
5 The first class graduated under this name was in 1874. There were no graduating 
classes in 1877, 78, 79, 80, or 81. During the session of 1882-83 there was a class 
of twenty-four matriculates, of whom fourteen were graduated at the close of the 
session.

classes in each subsequent year until the date of its coalition with the College of

This institution has until recently been a mixed college, women having 
been admitted to an attendance upon the winter course. Of the grad- 
uates during the session of 1886-87, twenty three in number, three were 
females. This plan, however, not having met with the success antici- 
pated, the board and faculty have determined to provide a spring course 
specially for women, equal in every respect to that arranged for male 
students. The faculty consists of eleven professors and one demonstra- 
tor, and A. G. Thomas, M. D., LL. D., is its president. 
ATLANTA MEDICAL COLLEGE. 
This college is said to be the oldest institution of learning in the city of 
Atlanta, having been organized in 1854. With the exception of the war 
period, it has been in active operation ever since. Its graduates num- 
ber more than one thousand, fifty-four having received the degree of 
M. D. at the last annual commencement, March 1, 1888. 
The faculty is composed of thirteen instructors, including a demon- 
strator in anatomy and an assistant to the chair of eye, ear, and throat 
diseases. Prof. H. V. M. Miller, M. D., LL. D.,isitsdean. Prominent 
among the professors is Dr. A. W. Calhoun, of Atlanta, who has charge

branch of medical science Doctor Calhoun is thoroughly conversant, and

dred graduates of this college. The last degrees conferred were in

  CHAPTER VIII. 
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. 
AUGUSTA ORPHAN ASYLUM.! 
We have seen under what circumstances and with what intents the 
Bethesda Orphan House was established at Savannah. Similar motives 
prompted the erection of an orphan asylum at Augusta. In furtherance 
of a desire, entertained by certain benevolent persons, to provide a 
home for orphans in that city, the Legislature of the State of Georgia, 
by an act approved January 22, 1852, incorporated “ Thomas W. Miller, 
Henry H. Cumming, Edward F. Campbell, John Milledge, Artemas 
Gould, Lewis D. Ford, and John R. Dow, and all others who may asso- 
ciate with them and their successors,” a body politic and corporate, by 
the name and style of “The Augusta Orphan Asylum,” and authorized 
the City Council “ to make a donation of lots of land in said city, money, 
or the bonds of said city, to such amount as they might deem proper, 
to the Augusta Orphan Asylum, to be used for the purposes of the said 
association.”? 
PROVISIONS FOR ITS SUPPORT. 
Some time elapsed before the society was prepared to undertake the 
care of orphans. Meanwhile, earnest effort was made, chiefly by Mr. 
Thomas W. Miller, to raise money by means of individual subscriptions. 
In May, 1854, the first board of managers, composed of Artemas 
Gould, president ; Thomas W. Miller, Lewis D. Ford, James Gardner, 
R. H. Gardner, Dr. James Mackie, and John R. Dow, adopted a consti- 
tution and by-laws. 
Early in 1855 a house was rented and placed in charge of a matron, 
and four orphans were admitted to the privileges of the asylum. At 
the same time, steps were taken looking to the erection of an orphan 
house upon a lot appropriated by the City Council for that purpose. 
This, however, became unnecessary, in consequence of a liberal bequest 
made to the society in the will of Isaac S. Tuttle, Esq., who died on De- 
cember 12, 1855, leaving the house formerly occupied by him on Walker

Street, and other property, amounting in all to fifty thousand dollars, for 
the use of the association. This gift, added to the income from two 
hundred shares of Georgia Railroad stock, previously donated to the 
asylum by the City Council, provided amply for the institution in its 
infancy. The “Tuttle house” was at once fitted up for an orphans’ 
home, and, with subsequent additions, was occupied as such about sev- 
enteen years. 
DONATION OF GEORGE M. NEWTON. 
The death of Dr. George M. Newton in January, 1859, brought to the 
asylum property valued at two hundred thousand dollars. This large 
increment to its resources opened to the society a field of usefulness 
wholly beyond the expectations of its founders and early friends. An 
amendment to its charter was obtained from the Legislature, December 
9, 1859, allowing the board of managers, at their discretion, to receive 
children who were not orphans, and from any county in the State, and 
prescribing severe penalties for leaving children at the asylum without 
the consent of the proper officers.! 
The income of the society, under the careful management of its first 
president, Mr. Gould, so far exceeded its necessary expenditures that 
at the time of his resignation of the trust, in April, 1870, the par value 
of its capital was $347,071. 
Soon after the death of Mr. Tuttle, the board of managers adopted 
resolutions looking to the building at some future time, on the “Tuttle 
lot,” on Walker Street, of an orphan house large enough to accommodate 
sixty children, with the necessary officers. The War and other causes 
prevented the accomplishment of this purpose for a number of years; 
and when in 1869 the society, was preparing to build, its condition and 
prospects called for a larger structure than was formerly contemplated, 
and a more desirable location. : f 
The subject of removal was carefully weighed in all its bearings, and 
an eligible site was finally agreed upon, viz, an ample lot fronting the 
Georgia Railroad, between Harper and Boundary Streets, near the 
western boundary of the city. For this wise choice the society is largely 
indebted to the influence of Dr. Lewis D. Ford, the second president of 
the association. 
THE NEW ORPHAN HOUSE. 
The present orphan house was begun in December, 1870, and com- 
pleted sufficiently for occupation in December, 1873 It is a hand- 
some and imposing structure, capable of accommodating one hundred 
and twenty-five children, having every provision for their care and 
comfort, and containing apartments for officers and employés. The cost 
of the building and grounds was about one hundred and seventy-four 
thousand dollars. :

  132 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA, 
This asylum is now in charge of a matron and two teachers, who to- 
gether constitute its faculty of instruction. According to the presi- 
dent’s report, as submitted April 20, 1887, there were one hundred and 
twenty-four children in the house on January 1 of that year, sixty-two 
of whom were boys and sixty-two girls, while in April of the following 
year we find one hundred and eight children in the asylum, fifty-seven 
being boys and fifty-one girls." 
Viewed asa whole, the Augusta Orphan Asylum represents, perhaps, 
the best type of its class in the South. It is certainly one of the most 
extensive, well-ordered, and successfully conducted institutions of its 
kind. 
: SAVANNAH FEMALE ASYLUM.” 
  Although the Female Asylum at Savannah is not so extensive as thé 
Orphan Asylum at Augusta, it is much older. It hada common origin 
with the Union Society? which was founded in 1750, and its object was 
to arrange for the care and education of orphan and destitute children. 
These, without distinction of sex, enjoyed the benefits of its charitable 
appropriations until the 17th of December, 1801, when, for the greater 
advantage of both classes of children, the Rev. Henry Holcombe, then 
resident pastor of the Baptist Church of Savannah, suggested to several 
ladies of piety and benevolence the propriety of a separation of the 
sexes. The suggestion was approved, and was promptly acted upon 
by the parties interested in the charitable scheme.* 
The female asylum, in 1801, commenced an independent existence, 
under a board of directors composed of fourteen ladies. In 1810 the 
Legislature of Georgia granted an act of incorporation, founded on a 
system of rules for the better government of the institution.’ 
Past experience demonstrated the necessity for a larger building and 
amore suitable location than the one occupied in the eastern part of 
the city, but the limited funds of the society, at the time, prevented the 
desired change. In 1838 Mrs. M. Marshall and ‘Mrs. M. Richardsone 
“1The cligibilityeof ¢ children for admission to the privileg ges of the asylum ‘depends 
upon their being orphans between the ages of three and ten. Unusual applications 
are submitted for the special determination of the board. (See Third By-Law.)

3 The plan of this society was projected by some three or four persons of as many 
different religious persuasions, and it was called “Union” to designate the amalga- 
mation of all creeds. The object of the society has ever been the maintenance and 
education of distressed orphan boys. (Anniversary Address by Thomas U. P. Charl- 
ton, April 23, 1823. Union Society Records, 1750-1858.) We are further told by Mr. 
Charlton that since the Revolutionary War one hundred and twenty-nine children 
have been supported and educated by the bounty of the society. 
4“‘The ‘Savannah Fémale Asylum’ (a society for supporting and educating helpless 
female orphans) was formed,” we are told, “in his (Mr. Holeombe’s) parlor, under a 
constitution and by-laws drawn up by himself.” (Campbell’s Georgia Baptists, p. 33.)

volunteered to assist the endeavors of the board of managers to in- 
crease, by a public collection, the available means of the society in the 
accomplishment of so laudable an object. Their combined efforts happily 
proved successful, and the erection of a substantial and commodious 
edifice on the corner of Bull and Charlton Streets was the result.! 
The Savannah Female Asylum has been maintained by annual sub- 
scriptions, and has received many valuable bequests. Writing of it in 
1847, Mr. Campbell says, that from its formation up to that time it had 
been the favorite of all denominations; and that individuals as well as 
bodies, in both the civil and religious departments of the community, 
had vied with each other in supporting it.? 
The affairs of the institution are managed by a board of directors who 
meet once a month, and a visiting committee is appointed to purchase 
the necessary food and raiment. The charity is conducted by a matron, 
a second matron, and a cook. <A teacher also instructs and resides in 
the asylum. The number of orphans in the asylum in 1885° was fifty- 
six. Children are admitted at the age of three years, and are bound to 
the asylum ‘‘as apprentices indented to a master, to learn any trade, 
profession, or calling,” until they reach the age of eighteen years.‘ 
OTHER ORPHAN ASYLUMS.® 
ORPHANS’ HOME OF THE SOUTH GEORGIA CONFERENCE.—There 
are two other asylums in the State, which have been erected for the 
care and education of orphans. One is the Orphans’ Home of the 
South Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, 
and is located in Bibb County, near Macon. It was founded by Mr. 
Maxwell, of that city, as his private benevolent enterprise in 1857, and 
so continued until 1873, when it passed into the hands of the above 
specified conference, by the voluntary contributions of whose members 
itis now supported. The superintendent of the asylum in 1885 was 
the Rev. L. B. Payne. Five hundred and forty-eight orphans had up to 
that time been received, and of this number five hundred and ten had 
been cared for since the asylum became the property of the conference. 
The Home has ninety acres of land, and the property is worth about 
eight thousand dollars. The children are taught in the elementary. 
branches, are instructed in farm and household work, and are retained 
until good homes can be secured for them. 
ORPHANS Home oF tHE NorTH GEORGIA CONFERENCE.—The 
other asylum to which we have alluded is the Orphans’ Home of the 
North Georgia Conference. It was established by that Conference of

the Methodist Episcopal Church South in 1867. The venerable Jesse 
Boring, M. D., D. D., originated the plan, and it was founded mainly 
through his efforts. This home is located near Decatur, De Kalb 
County. It owns a comfortable house of eight rooms, and a farm of 
three hundred acres, which is partly under cultivation. The institu- 
tion has no endowment, but is entirely dependent upon voluntary 
contributions from the people. About sixty otherwise homeless children 
are here well cared for, properly trained in mind and morals, and fitted 
to fill honest and honorable vocations in life. Rev. A. J. Gibson, super- 
intendent and agent in 1885, was assisted by his wife. They resided 
at the home. 
GEORGIA INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.! 
  At the session of the Legislature in 1833, Mr. John L. Flournoy pre- 
sented a memorial praying for thé establishment of an institution for 
the education of deaf-mutes. It was referred to the Governor with a 
request that he obtain full information, and report to the next meeting 
of the General Assembly. At the next session, in November, 1834, His 
Excellency Hon. Wilson Lumpkin laid all the information he had ac- 
. quired before the Legislature, expressing himself as particularly in- 
debted to Governor Foot, of Connecticut, and Lewis Weld, the princi- 
pal of the Deaf and Dumb Academy at Hartford. In consequence of 
this correspondence Mr. Weld came to Georgia with a class of deaf- 
mutes, and exhibited their educational attainments before the members 
of the Legislature. The result was, the General Assembly appropriated 
three thousand dollars for the education of the “indigent deaf and 
dumb of the State, between the ages of twelve and twenty,” at the asy- 
lum at Hartford? This experiment, as will be seen, proved unsatisfac- 
tory, on account of the great distance and the unwillingness of subjects 
to go so far from home, and among strangers. 
In March, 1835, Rey. Elijah Sinclair was appointed by Governor Lump- 
kin State commissioner to ascertain who were the indigent deaf and 
dumb children of the State; to collect and convey them to Hartford ; 
and to have them supported and educated there at the expense of the 
State. He was faithful and zealous in the execution of the trust. He 
was re-appointed to the same work by two of the successors of Gover- 
nor Lumpkin, and was complimented by the Legislature for his effi- 
ciency and integrity. He travelled extensively over the State search-

ing for deaf-mutes, but succeeded in sending only six to Hartford. In 
1836 he found sixteen in the State who came within the provisions of 
the law, but only three could be induced to go. 
In 1842 and 1843 Cedar Valley Academy made successful experi- 
ments in teaching deaf-mutes; and in December, 1845, the Legislature 
required all the State beneficiaries to be withdrawn from Hartford and 
educated in Georgia.! The Rev. Jesse H. Campbell, then State commis- 
sioner, arranged with the Hearn Manual Labor School at Cave Spring, 
Floyd County, to make the education of deaf-mutes a department of that 
institution. Mr. O. P. Fannin, then associate instructor in that school, 
was sent to Hartford, in order to acquire the methods of teaching. He 
returned with the Georgia pupils and entered them in the deaf-mute 
department of the Hearn School, which was opened with four scholars 
in a log cabin May 15, 1846. 
PROVISION OF THE LEGISLATURE. 
In 1847 the Legislature provided the means for erecting a suitable 
building.2 Cave Spring was the site chosen, and the building was fin- 
ished in June, 1849, and occupied on the first of the following July. 
From that time until March, 1862, there was no break in the operations of 
the school; but the turbulence of the times and the enlistment of two 
of the teachers in the army decided the trustees then to suspend its ex- 
ercises. It was reopened, however, in February, 1867, the Legislature 
having made an appropriation for that purpose during the preceding 
year. Ever since it has been in active existence. 
TERMS OF ADMISSION. 
In 1876, pursuant to a recommendation made by the board of trus- 
tees’ in their report to the Governor for 1875, the General Assembly 
authorized and provided for the erection of a suitable building for the 
admission of negro pupils, and since its completion the colored deaf- 
mutes have enjoyed equal facilities for instruction with the whites, 
under the immediate care of teachers of their own race. All deaf-

mutes of the State who are over ten and under twenty-seven years of 
age, mentally and physically unimpaired and free from any immoral 
habit or contagious disease, are entitled to all the benefits of the acad- 
emy, free of charge, for the term of seven years; and an additional 
term is aiso allowed to ‘‘such pupils as have exhibited a commendable 
energy and a mental capacity to be benefited; the conferring of this 
privilege being conditional upon good behavior and diligent applica- 
tion.”' Deaf-mutes from other States are admitted upon payment 
of one hundred and seventy-five dollars each per school term of ten 
months. 
The annual State appropriations for the support of the institution 
have averaged about fifteen thousand dollars.? The estimated value of 
the property in 1876 was twenty-five thousand dollars, and there were 
then almost one thousand volumes in the library.’ 
In 1886 the number receiving instruction was ninety-one, sixty-one 
of whom were whites and thirty colored. There were four instructors 
in the white and two in the colored department, and Prof. W. O. Con- 
nor was principal. During the present year (1883), there has been 
an attendance of eighty-six deaf-mutes, fifty-seven being white and 
twenty-nine colored. 
GEORGIA ACADEMY FOR THE BLIND.‘ 
This institution was incorporated by an act of the Legislature of 
Georgia assented to January 2, 1852. It originated in a movement 
made by the citizens of Macon, at a meeting held for this purpose on 
the 18th of April, 1851.° 
In January of that year Mr. W. S. Fortescue had arrived in Macon 
from Philadelphia, with letters of recommendation as a suitable person 
to introduce into Georgia a system for the education of the blind, and 
it was at the convocation just referred to that the first publication on 
the subject occurred. The result of the meeting was the appointment 
by the chair of five persons to solicit subscriptions, with a view to en- 
abling Mr. Fortescue to educate four blind children until the convening

session of 1887.

of the next Legislature. The committee selected were, W.S. Fortescue, 
Dr. J. M. Green, R. A. Smith, R. S. Lightfoot, and Edwin Graves. A 
number of ladies and gentlemen subscribed liberally on the first call. 
On the 4th of July the subscribers met, and Doctor Green, chairman of 
- the committee, read his report, which showed that six hundred and fifty 
dollars had been promised. It also stated that application had been 
made for a copy of the Bible in raised characters; that a piano had been 
purchased and an apparatus engaged; that the General Assembly would 
be petitioned for aid; and that the statistics showed that there were 
two hundred and twenty blind children in the State without the rudi- 
ments of education. The report was adopted. 
The committee then submitted a preamble and articles organizing the 
Georgia Academy for the Blind, to be located in Macon. This was fol- 
lowed by the election of seven trustees as follows: J. M. Green, N. C. 
Munroe, EB. B. Weed, John B. Lamar, R. A. Smith, Edwin Graves, and 
A. H.Chappell. Before the adjournment of the meeting, one hundred 
and fifty-two more dollars were subscribed. 
The school was opened in July, 1851. Mr. W.S. Fortescue was the 
first principal, and Miss Hannah Guillan the female teacher. It was 
sustained by charitable donations of citizens until. the session of the 
Legislature in the ensuing January, when it received a charter. The act 
required the trustees to ‘‘select indigent blind persons from different 
counties of the State, between the ages of twelve and thirty, and main- 
tain and educate them gratuitously,” and appropriated five thousand 
dollars per annum for the years 1852 and 1853, to aid in supporting the 
institution.! 
On January 22, 1852, Mr. Munroe resigned the presidency of the 
board, of which he was the first chairman, and was succeeded by Doe- 
tor Green, who continued in office for nearly thirty years. In July of 
the next year, the board presented their first Annual Report. In it 
the president stated: 
THE PRESIDENT’S REPORT. 
“The class of pupils was ten, three boys and seven girls, and had 
made astonishing progress in arithmetic, geography, and other depart- 
ments of knowledge. Some of the female pupils made an equally re- 
markable progress in crochet work, sewing, and other varieties in use- 
ful and ornamental needlework.” ; 
Shortly after, Governor Howell Cobb, in an eloquent lecture before 
the Milledgeville Lyceum, proposed that ‘one-third of the large reve- 
nue of the State Road should be devoted to the maintenance of the 
three great objects of the State charity,—the Lunatic Asylum (at Mil- 
ledgeville, opened in 1842), the Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the 
School for the Blind;”? but the suggestion was never adopted.

APPROPRIATIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE. 
The necessities of the academy having greatly increased, application 
was made in 1855 for an appropriation of twenty thousand dollars to 
erect suitable buildings. This was grantedin 1856. Half that amount 
had been obtained from the Legislature for the same purpose in 1854." 
‘Upon investigation, however, it was found that the sum was inadequate 
to the expense of the undertaking. Further appropriations were after- 
ward made, and the academy was finished and océupied by pupils in 
1859. Its cost was about sixty-five thousand dollars. The ceremony 
of laying the corner-stone of the academy, located on a beautiful loton 
College Hill, was conducted on July 5, 1852, with imposing effect, in 
the presence of two thousand spectators. Hon. Thomas Hardeman 
was chosen the orator on that occasion, in appreciation of his signal 
efforts in the House of Representatives to secure the requisite increase 
of appropriation. 
During the War the academy building was used for a Confederate 
hospital. The teachers and pupils moved to Fort Valley, where the 
school was kept in operation until their return to the academy in 1865. 
In the meanwhile, the Federal Army had occupied the building, and 
had destroyed and carried off five thousand dollars’ worth of property 
‘belonging to the institution. The school was continued by loans until 
the State was in a condition to resume the payment of its accustomed 
appropriations. 
The first principal of the academy was Mr. Fortescue (already alluded 
to) in 1852, with Miss Hannah Guillan as assistant, who still retains 
her position. In 1853 and ’54 H. Dutton was in charge; in 1855 and 
56, M. Horne; and in 1857 and 758, Rev. W. N. Chaudoin. In August, 
1858, the present incumbent, Prof. W. D. Williams was elected princi- 
pal. Beside Professor Williams and Miss Guillan, who supervises the 
department of literature, there is an instructor in music. 
In 1876, we are told,’ there were fifty-six pupils in the academy; and 
that since its opening one hundred and forty-five had been admitted, 
of whom seventy-five had been discharged as educated in one or more 
of the departments. Many of them had acquired trades, by which they 
could earn their support. Pupils were then admitted between the ages 
of eight and twenty ;° males over twenty were taken into the workshop 
to learn trades. The value of the buildings, grounds, and property was 
at that time seventy-five thousand doilars, and there were about one 
thousand volumes in the library, including those in embossed print.

3This has been altered. In accordance with Section 1215 of the Georgia Code of 
1882, ‘‘ All indigent, blind persons, residents of this State, between the ages of seven 
and twenty-five years, shall be selected by the trustees from’ the different counties of 
the State, received into the academy, and supported and educated gratuitously to the 
extent the funds will permit.” And itis farther specified that ‘a beneficiary shall 
not remain at the charge of the institution longer than four years.”

DEPARTMENT OF THE COLORED BLIND. 
In 1882 a department for the colored blind! was opened, and is doing. 
a good work for this class. Of the ninety-one names on the 1885-86 
register, twelve belonged to colored pupils. Of the two hundred thou- 
sand dollars and more which the State has appropriated, first and last, 
for grounds and improvements, fourteen thousand were for the benefit 
of the colored blind.”   
1The establishment of this department was largely due to Hon L. N. Whittle, 
who was the first, it is believed, to suggest the advisability of calling the attention 
of the State Legislature to the colored blind, and requesting an appropriation from 
them ‘to purchase or rent necessary buildings and provide for the support and edu- 
cation of such pupils as may offer.”

  CHAPTER IX. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR COLORED PEOPLE. 
These institutions are all of recent growth, having come into exist- 
ence since the War. So long as slavery continued, little attempt was 
made to educate the blacks, except in a religious way.! In fact, it was 
forbidden by statute” to teach a slave to read or write. 
This inhibition did not, however, deter some masters and mistresses 
from teaching their domestics to read the Scriptures, and sometimes to 
use the pen. Field hands, as a class, were almost universally illiterate. 
Carpenters, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, and mechanics often read and 
understood something of arithmetic. The instances of slaves being 
able to read, write, or cipher were, however, very few.

Digest of Georgia Laws, p. 981), it is declared ‘that all and every person and persons 
whatsoever, who shall hereafter teach, or cause any slave or slaves to be taught to 
write, or fead writing, or shall use or employ any slave as a scribe in any manner of 
writing whatsoever, every such person and persons shall, for every such offence, for- 
feit the sum of twenty pounds sterling.” 
Again, in Section 11 of an act approved December 22, 1829 (Ibid., p. 1001), we find 
this provision: “If any slave, negro, or free person of color, or any white person, 
shall teach any other slave, negro, or free person of color, to read or write either writ- 
ten or printed characters, the said free person of color or slave shall be punished by 
fine and whipping, or fine or whipping at the discretion of the court; and if a white 
person be found so offending, he, she, or they shall be punished with fine, not exceed- 
ing five hundred dollars, and imprisonment in the common jail at the discretion of 
the court before whom the offender is tried.” 
See also act of March 7, 1755. (Acts passed by the General Assembly of the colony 
of Georgia from 1755 to 1774—now first printed,—pp. 73-99. Wormsloe, 1881.) It was 
there provided that the penalty for teaching or causing any slave or slaves to be 
taught to write, or for employing a slave as a scribe, should be fifteen pounds ster- 
ling.

  INSTITUTIONS FOR COLORED PEOPLE, 141 
A wonderful change occurred upon the termination of the War and 
the establishment of the public school system. Then the doors were 
freely opened for the instruction of the blacks in the elementary branches 
of an English education. They were allowed to participate with the 
whites in the benefits of the school fund raised by general taxation, and 
multitudes! availed themselves of the privileges thus afforded. Never- 
theless, but little progress has been made by the race in what may be 
termed higher education. In the ordinary common schools of the rural 
districts the education, as we have previously shown (Chapter ITJ), is 
of a very primitive sort, being confined to reading, writing, and arith- 
metic, and a smattering of geography and history. In certain local- 
ities, on the other hand, schools have been opened in which the pupils 
are fairly taught, not only reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also 
history, geography, mental and moral philosophy, and advanced math- 
ematies, and where colored females are making commendable progress 
in learning to play upon the melodeon, the parlor organ, and the piano. 
To a consideration of the characteristics of, and the advantages afforded 
by, the six prominent institutions in Georgia for the higher education 
of the colored race, the remaining sections of this paper will be devoted. 
ATLANTA UNIVERSITY.” 
At the close of the War the Freedmen’s Bureau, together with va- 
rious Northern aid societies, began the work of educating the negroes in 
the South. By far the most prominent among these aid societies was the 
American Missionary Association. They were not content with primary 
education, of which the negroes stood most in need, but they turned 
their attention to the erection of schools for their higher instruction. 
__» From its central and healthful location Atlanta was chosen as the best 
place for such a school. The efforts made to raise money through the 
North met with success; and in October, 1867, the board of trustees 
was organized and the Atlanta University was duly chartered. Funds 
were obtained from the bureau, and about fifty acres of land were se- 
cured in the western part of the city. In June, 1869, the corner-stone , 
of the first building was laid, and in the following October the building 
was occupied by the school. It was designed for a girls’ dormitory, 
but, during the first year, it furnished accommodations, both school and   
1 From the State School Commissioner’s last report (1888) we learn that during 1887 
there were in attendance upon the public schools of Georgia 133,429 colored pupils, 
and this number is steadily increasing.

boarding, for boys and girls. In August, 1870, another building of the 
same style, but larger, containing sleeping apartments for about sixty 
boys, beside temporary school-rooms, was completed. To this, during 
the ensuing year, a wing was added, providing rooms for about forty 
additional pupils. None of the money expended in the erection of these 
structures was derived from the State. 
The last Republican Governor of Georgia, Mr. Conley, sold the land 
donated by Congress under the act of July 2, 1862, comprising some 
two hundred and seventy thousand acres, at the rate of ninety cents per 
acre. The sum realized from this sale, when invested in State bonds, 
was, in round numbers, two hundred and forty-three thousand dollars. 
When the Democrats came into power in 1872, under the administration 
of Governor James M, Smith, this entire fund was transferred to the 
State University at Athens. That college being already firmly estab- 
lished and organized with suitable buildings, it seemed best to make 
this disposition of the fund. In 1870 the Legislature appropriated eight 
thousand dollars to the colored school at Atlanta. During the session 
of 1871-72, in which the colored race was strongly represented, vig- 
orous attempts were made to undo the work of Governor Smith. A 
compromise, however, was effected for that year, on condition that the 
Atlanta University should receive eight thousand dollars from the State. 
This was deemed a fair offset to the seventeen thousand dollars annually 
given to the State University. ; 
The Legislature in the following year refused to continue this appro- 
priation; but in 1874 a bill entitled, “An Act to equitably adjust the 
claims of the colored race for a portion of the proceeds of the agricult- 
ural land scrip,” and providing for an annual appropriation to the At- 
lanta University of eight thousand dollars, was introduced and almost 
unanimously passed by the General Assembly. It appropriated the 
money with the understanding that the board of visitors of the Uni- 
versity of Georgia should also visit that school; that the money should 
not be paid by the Governor until the plan of the trustees for its expen- 
diture had been approved by a commission of three members of the 
faculty of the University of Georgia; and that the school should edu. 
eate, free of charge for tuition, one pupil for every member of the House 
of Representatives, to be nominated by the members. In defence of the 
bill it was urged that Congress could not have intended the agricultural 
fund for the whites alone; that on the ground of policy it was advisable 
to appropriate a large amount to the colored school, since measures were 
already pending in Congress for an increased appropriation of land, and 
the share of Georgia might be curtailed if the money should be confined 
to the whites; and that it would not be right to deprive the State Uni- 
versity of any of its portion, as such action would cripple it in its agri- 
cultural department at Athens and the branch. college at Dahlonega.

  INSTITUTIONS FOR COLORED PEOPLE. 143 
Supported by these arguments the bill, became a law, and its provis- 
ions have been regularly carried into effect until a very recent date.1 
THE UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM. 
The curriculum of the Atlanta University at first consisted of a pre- 
paratory and a normal department. In 1872 the collegiate department 
was opened, and provision was subsequently made for instruction in 
theology ona broad catholic basis, and without regard to any particular — 
denomination. The preparatory department, in the second year of the 
school’s operations, embraced higher arithmetic, algebra, geometry, 
ancient history, ancient geography, Latin, and Greek. The normal 
course then included a careful survey of the elementary branches, with 
reference to teaching them, algebra, geometry, natural science, mental 
and moral philosophy, drawing, English literature, Latin, and the theory 
and practice of teaching. This latter department has, in its conduct, 
subserved an important and useful purpose. It is steadfastly borne in 
mind by the institution, and every effort is made to prepare the pupils 
for their chosen calling of teachers. Many of those who have attended 
its classes are now busily engaged in teaching, not only in Georgia, but 
also in adjoining States.? 
Beside the three courses already named—collegiate, preparatory, 
and normal—the University has a mechanical course and a grammar 
school course. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
The former covers three years, and all male students above the third 
grade are required to take it in addition to their regular studies in other 
courses, six and a half hours in each week being devoted to this work.   
1 Those charged with the control and management of the Atlanta University having 
recently declined to stipulate against the co-education of the races, the payment by 
the State of its annual appropriation of eight thousand dollars for the support of that 
University, as an institution for the exclusive instruction and training of colored pupils, 
has been temporarily withheld. (See Laws of 1887, p.901.) The Governor is directed 
not to draw his warrant for the amount until sich a plan of expenditure as will secure 
the use of the same for the education of colored children only, in accordance with the 
declared and settled policy of the State on the subject of the co-education of the races, 
shall have been submitted and approved by the commission constituted in the act of 
March 3, 1874, for the supervision of the expenditure of the appropriation. See, in 
this connection, the section in Governor Gordon’s Annual Message of November 9, 
1888, relating to the Atlanta University and the eight thousand dollars appropriation. 
2The only theological classes graduated at Atlanta University were in 1871, when 
the class consisted of one member, and in 1876, when it was composed of three mem- 
bers. (Catalogue fur 1886-87, p. 5.) 
3 We find by the catalogue of 1886-87 that nearly all the graduates, and many who 
left before finishing their course, are now engaged in teaching during a portion or all 
of the year; and that beside these, during the four months of the summer vacation, 
alarge number of students engage in teaching. It is estimated that over ten thousand 
children in Georgia are taught, annually, by those who have been connected as pupils 
with this institution. Itis also stated that of the one hundred and fifty-five graduates 
up to 1836, one hundred and fourteen were from the normal classes.

  144 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
In the shops the boys are taught the principles of wood and metal- 
working, the use of wood-turning lathes and tools, glazing, and drawing. 
The facilities for the pursuit of this mechanical course have been 
greatly increased by the erection of the Knowles Industrial Building. 
This structure was the gift of Mrs. L. J. Knowles, of Worcester, Mass., 
through whose generosity it was erected in 1884 as a memorial to her 
husband, The building is of brick, one hundred by forty-four feet, and 
three stories high. It has a good outfit of tools and other appliances. 
One room contains eighteen cabinet benches, each with a set of tools; 
another has twelve wood-turning lathes, run by steam-power; and a 
third, the forge room, recently put in operation, is supplied with twelve 
forges and anvils. 
Special emphasis must be laid upon the industrial education afforded 
at this Atlanta University. It appears to be complete and satisfactory. 
The mechanical work of the shops is united with an agricultural train- 
ing on the farm, embodying instruction in the methods of farm man- 
agement and in the details of stock raising and gardening.! The girls, 
on the other hand, are taught various branches of household duties, 
such as sewing, cooking, dress-making, and general house-keeping. 
The industrial department has always claimed the attention of, and 
received an honorable mention from the visiting boards. Referring to 
the progress it had made and its excellent workings, the visitors in June, 
1884, said in their report to the Governor: ‘ Your committee would state 
that there was no department of this University that struck them more 
favorably than the industrial education in all its variousforms. * * * 
The boys are taught practical agriculture and gardening. * * * The 
house-keeping department, under a competent lady for the graduating 
girls, we especially liked.” 
Again, in the report for 1886, we read: “‘The domestic arts of cooking, 
sewing, and dress-inaking are taught by competent instructors. Garden- 
ing and farming are closely looked after by a very capable and trust- 
worthy agriculturist. * * * Theresults achieved in this direction are 
eminently satisfactory. In the mechanic arts, including carpentry and 
wood-turning, very gratifying progresshas been made. * * * With 
better equipments, we have the germ of a technological school that will 
be a blessing to the State.” And in the report for 1887, we find that 
«the agricultural exhibit, consisting of varieties of corn, wheat, grass, 
and the like, raised upon the farm, was very creditable;” and that 
“instruction in the art of printing likewise forms a part of the indus- 
trial training, though the appliances in this department are as yet in- 
complete.” 
CAPACITY FOR A HIGH GRADE OF CULTURE. 
Thomas Jefferson has been credited with saying that no pure African 
could ever grasp the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid. This remark 
''The rule has been for the boys to spend one hour a day in practical work on the 
farm,

was widely quoted through the South as a strong indorsement of the 
popular view regarding the mental incapacity of the negroes, and. their 
inability to understand or appreciate the higher branches of education. 
Later developments, however, and the results arrived at by this and 
other schools, seem destined to bring about a modification of that view: 
for, while the course of study is almost as advanced as that of many of 
the white colleges, including, as it does, the Latin of Cicero, Tacitus, 
and Livy, and the Greek of Homer, Demosthenes, and Plato, trigonom- 
etry and surveying,' history, English literature, mental and moral phi- 
losophy, and approved text-books in political economy and the sciences, 
the students, by the testimony of the whites themselves, perform their 
work with commendable success. Witness, for instance, the confession 
contained in the report of Senator Joseph E. Brown, chairman of the 
first board of visitors appointed by the Governor: 
“At every step of the examination we were impressed with the fal- 
lacy of the popular idea (which, in common with thousands of others, 
a majority of the undersigned have heretofore entertained) that the 
members of the African race are not capable of a high grade of intel- 
lectual culture. The rigid tests to which the classes in algebra and ge- 
ometry, and in Latin and Greek, were subjected, unequivocally demon- 
strated that under judicious training and with persevering study, there 
are many members of the African race who can attain a high grade of 
intellectual culture. They proved that they can master intricate prob- 
Jems in mathematics, and fully comprehend the construction of difficult 
passages in the classics.” 
Note also the report of the committee of the board of visitors of the 
University of Georgia for 1874: “The progress made by the students, 
as a whole, is highly satisfactory, while there were not wanting many 
instances of superior merit and proficiency among their members.” — 
Soon after the ciose of the Civil War, an unnatural feeling of hostility 
sprang up between the whites and the blacks in the South. A mutual 
sentiment of distrust was the inevitable consequence. To add to the 
difficulty of the situation, a horde of adventurers came in from other 
States, seeking wealth and political preferment through the instru- 
mentality of colored votes. They were in many cases sharp and unprin- 
cipled, and fanned the slight flame of race prejudice into a mighty blaze, 
which it required years to subdue. 
When, therefore, the whites were restored to power in Georgia, and 
the Legislature appropriated the money to Atlanta University, much 
dissatisfaction was manifested by the people of the State.2 It is even   
  
1Mathematics is only studied through the Freshman and Sophomore years. 
? Objections have been urged against Atlanta University, on the ground that such 
a “movement in favor of university education for the colored people is far in ad- 
vance of the demands of the present condition of colored society ;” and that ‘the 
money thus expended should be exclusively devoted to instructing and training 
teachers specially for the work of elementary schools.” (State School Commissioner 
Orr’s Report for 1875.) 
11408--No. 4—-10

  146 EDUCATION IN GEORGIA. 
stated that some influential persons endeavored to prevent the appro- 
priations to the school. The secret of this dissatisfaction lay in the cir- 
cumstance that the teachers employed at the institution were all North- 
erners, who, it was alleged, sedulously instilled in the mind of the col- 
ored pupil feelings of dislike for his native State, and of bitter hatred 
for the whites. 
But better counsels at length prevailed, and the State board of visit- 
ors adopted the rational plan of allaying the feeling of animosity on the 
part of the colored people. Their attention, in this connection, was 
first called to the manner of instruction in the school. They noticed 
the sectional books in use, and urged upon the president the propriety 
of changing the tendency of the teaching. The aim of the instructors, 
they said, should not be to alienate the affections of the pupils from 
their country, and induce a feeling of opposition to the whites, but to 
cultivate kindly relations between the two. They had enormous power 
over those who controlled almost one-half the votes in the Empire State, 
since their pupils were eminently “clay in the hands of the potter.” 
The pupils trained there would go forth and exercise a great influence 
on the others whom they might teach; and it was highly incumbent on 
the instructors to make faithful, devoted citizens of them. 
Such arguments had their weight with President E. A. Ware, and 
bore in time the desired fruits. The committee of visitors for 1877 re- 
ported: “ Members of the Board thought that the animus of the pupils 
this year seemed much better.” Again, in the report of the board for 
1878-79, we find it announced that “the objectionable sectional books 
have disappeared from the library, and your committee are assured, not 
only that those Northern teachers do not try to alienate them [the pu- 
pils] from old masters and homes, and from their native State, but that 
every effort is used to counteract any tendency towards such aliena- 
tion.” : 
The reports on the educational work accomplished at Atlanta Uni- 
versity have continued to be favorable to the present time. In all of 
them is evinced a sincere faith in the capacity of the colored race. In 
the report for 1883 occurs this passage: 
“We confess to some degree of surprise and gratification at the pro- 
ficiency exhibited by many of the pupils in every department of study 
in which they were examined before us. This was particularly true in 
relation to those studies which pertain to the higher culture.” 
Thus has this institution, in the brief period of its existence, become 
a large and influential medium for the education of the colored race. 
Commencing with only a preparatory and a normal department and 
eighty-nine students in 1869, it has by gradual steps risen to its pres- 
ent status! of five courses of study, and an attendance of four hundred 
and thirteen? Its faculty, which in its early years consisted of but nine

teachers, is now numerically more than twice as strong as it was then.! 
Its curriculum, while somewhat restricted in its compass at the start, 
is now as complete and advanced as that of not a few of the older white 
colleges in the South. The school, though indebted to Georgia for its 
principal patronage, has extendedits constituency beyond the limits of 
‘that State,? and its one hundred and sixty or more graduates may be 
seen engaged from Washington to Texas in spreading the influence of 
the Atlanta University. 
RESOURCES OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
A word now in regard to the general resources of Atlanta University. 
The institution, as has been seen, owes its existence almost entirely to 
donations from liberal Northern friends in the American Missionary As- 
sociation, and is very largely beholden for its support to the same 
generous source. In the financial statement of May, 1872, for the pre- 
ceding twelve-month, it appears that out of tne thirty-one thousand dol- 
lars which had been received, fourteen thousand were donated by the 
American Missionary Association. In the printed register of gifts of 
twenty-five dollars and upward, all except a small fraction came from 
the North, the New England States furnishing, on an average, about 
two-thirds. In a similar list for 1886-87, out of sixty-five hundred dol- 
lars in round numbers, the entire amount, with the exception of six 
hundred and fifty dollars, was contributed by Northern and Western 
States. 
It was a New York man, Mr. R. R. Graves, who chiefly founded the 
library of Atlanta University, aud permanently endowed it with five 
thousand dollars. This library now contains some six thousand vol- 
umes, and through the aid afforded by the endowment fund is experi- 
encing a steady growth. The John F. Slater Fund has, for some years, 
appropriated fourteen hundred dollars a year to the school. Mr. Tuthill 
King, of Chicago, and Mr. J. H. Cassedy, and the late Hon. William E. 
Dodge, of New York, have each established scholarships of five thousand 
doilars. The Plainfield and Garfield Scholarship Funds are smaller than 
the others. Mrs. Valeria G. Stone, of Malden, Mass., who has deeply 
interested herself in the intellectual improvement of the colored people 
both North and South, having, it is said, donated over one million dol- 
lars to that object, built what is known as Stone Hall, and has given 
fifty thousand dollars to the University. The building heré alluded to 
was erected in 1882, and contains the chapel and library, the school- 
room, recitation and lecture rooms for the more advanced students, and       
  
' There is no regular president of the faculty. Its acting president is Rey. Horace 
Bumstead, D. D. 
? Of recent years nearly one-half of Georgia’s one hundred and thirty-seven counties, 
and from five to ten States, have been represented on the University register. Accord- 
ing to the board of visitors’ report for 1887, sixty-four counties of Georgia and eight 
other States were represented at the University.

the philosophical! and chemical laboratory. Of the Knowles Industrial 
Building, likewise an individual gift to the institution, we have already 
spoken. The annual appropriation from the State has, until its recent 
discontinuance, invariably been confined to the payment of teachers’ 
salaries. ‘i 
Atlanta University is now in the twenty-first year of its corporate 
existence. During that period it has acquired a vested capital in lands, 
buildings, library, and valuable appurtenances fairly estimated at two 
hundred thousand dollars.2. The college structures are four in number, 
consisting of the two buildings just mentioned, and the two dormitories, » 
which are respectively designated as North Hall and South Hall. There 
is also a large barn on the premises. It was erected in 1882, and fur- 
nishes facilities for the development of the farm work of the University. 
These buildings are situated on high ground in the western part of the 
city of Atlanta, and are surrounded by about sixty acres of land be- 
longing to the institution. 
ATLANTA BAPTIST SEMINARY.? 
This seminary, for the education of colored ministers and teachers in 
Georgia, is sustained chiefly by the American Baptist Home Mission 
Society, the headquarters of which are in New York. Established in 
1867, i¢ was located for a time in Augusta, under the name of the 
“Augusta Institute,” where it struggled with many difficulties until 1871. 
At that time an unworthy party, Seigfried, by name, who was at its 
head, was dismissed; and the institution was organized in a more 
effective form by his successor in the office of principal, Rev. &. T. 
Robert, LL.D. Doctor Robert was a Southerner by birth, although 
long a resident in Ohio and Iowa, and had been strongly recommended 
to the society by the white Southern Baptist ministers as a suitable 
person for the conduct of the enterprise. Eight years of prosperity 
and progress followed, and, in 1879, the seminary was transferred to 
the capital of the State, at Atlanta, and now bears the name of Atlanta 
Baptist Seminary. 
Weare informed that during the ten years of Doctor Robert’s adminis- 
tration, ending with 1881, three hundred and seventy-one students had 
received instruction in the school, of whom one hundred and forty-two 
contemplated teaching, and two hundred and twenty-nine had the min- 
istry in view. Of the eighty students then in attendance, fifty or more

may be enumerated among the philosophical apparatus.

were pastors or candidates for the ministry. According to the 1886-87 
catalogue, the number in the seminary was one hundred and forty-six ; 
eighteen being in the theological department, thirty-two studying for 
the ministry, and forty-two preparing to become teachers. 
The present faculty consists of five instructors, of whom the Rev. 
Samuel Graves, D. D., is president. The studies pursued in the semi- 
nary are comprehended in the normal, preparatory, collegiate (which 
includes a classical and a scientific course), and theological depart- 
ments. The theological course has been extended so as to embrace two 
years. A library is attached to the institution, which now contains up- 
ward of seventeen hundred volumes. 
CLARK UNIVERSITY.! 
Founding of the University—This institution is supported by the 
Freedmen’s Aid Society, a charitable organization of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church. Bishops Clark and Haven were chiefly instrumen- 
tal in founding it. From the former, in consideration of his distin- 
guished labors in its behalf, the University takesits name. It was be- 
gun in 1869 as a primary school, with a department for the training of 
preachers. It was not chartered as a University until 1877. The col- 
lege was located at Atlanta.? For the first few years it occupied a small 
building on Whitehall Street, and was afterward (in 1880) removed to 
its present desirable position at the southern end of Capitol Avenue. 
In 1872 the institution passed under the control of the city, the un- 
derstanding being that the latter would pay the teachers’ salaries and 
furnish the necessary buildings. The other funds were then applied to 
the establishment of a theological department, in accordance with the 
wish of Bishop Clark, who had left, by will, several thousand dollars for 
that purpose. The city failed to comply with that part of its agree- 
ment providing for the erection of buildings, and new arrangements 
had to be made. 
Through the hearty co-operation and generous contributions of its 
Northern friends, Clark University has been liberated from all embar- 
rassment and placed upon a firm and excellent basis. It has fine col- 
lege buildings,’ situated upon a tract of some four hundred acres of land   
1 Henderson’s Commonwealth of Georgia, p. 279. Catalogues for 1885-86 and 1886-87. 
?This city was chosen, as it ‘‘might give character and influence to our movement,” 
writes A. W. Cummings (Early Schools of Methodism, p. 410); ‘for Atlanta is the 
gateway to the South, and exerts a controlling influence over it.” 
’There are three of these structures. Chrisman Hall, a cut of which is here ap- 
pended, was erected at a cost of twenty-seven thousand dollars, and was dedicated in 
1880. It bears the name of Mrs. Eliza Chrisman, of Topeka, Kans., that lady having 
donated ten thousand dollars toward the building fund, the balance being raised by 
subscription in the North. The Gammon Theological Hall, opened in 1883, was com_ 
pleted and furnished at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. It is built of brick, with 
stone trimmings, and is one hundred and ten feet long by fifty-two feet wide, and is 
four stories high. Rey. E. H. Gammon, of Batavia, Ill, beside contributing eight 
thousand dollars to this object, has recently added a gift of two hundred thousand

  which it owns, in the suburbs of Atlanta. It also has a numerous and 
well-organized faculty, a comprehensive system of instruction, embrac- 
ing, in addition to the collegiate, academic, normal, and grammar school 
courses, a school of theology, business and industrial departments, a 
coliege of music, and good philosophical apparatus and libraries. 
The Theological School.—The theological school, which is pre-eminently 
the strong feature of the institution, is handsomely endowed and pos- 
sesses a valuable library of over four thousand volumes. It receives 
students from nearly every Southern State.1. The full theological course 
occupies three years; but partial courses of one or two years have 
been provided for those who are not adle to pursue the regular classes. 
Graduates in the former case receive the degree of bacheior of divinity; 
in the latter, a certificate from the institution. Free tuition as well as 
free rooms are accorded to the regular members of the theological 
school.” 
The Industrial Department.—The industrial department is also a 
specialty. Its excellence is indorsed by Dr. Atticus G. Haygood, who 
says that “Clark University is second only to Hampton® in this line.” 
The work, running through three years, includes carpentry, carriage 
construction, house-keeping, dress-making, printing, and shoe-making. 
Agricultural training is also afforded, and a nurse-training department 
has been recently opened under the direction of the resident physician, 
assisted by some of the best medical talent of the city. 
The course in the college of music is thorough as far as it goes. Pu- 
pils are there instructed in the principles and practice of playing upon 
the piano and the organ. 
There are twenty teachers in the University faculty, exclusive of its      a = rash ee See a eee ae

Hall is the new building just finished, and is intended for the use of the females. It 
contains a number of dormitories, a large reading-room, and a dining-room capable 
of seating several hundred persons. Twenty-seven thousand dollars were expended 
in its erection, one-half of which amount was supplied by Doctor Gammon. Ballard 
Hall, so called because Mr. Stephen Ballard, of Brooklyn, N. Y., donated toward its 
construction five thousand dollars, is still in process of erection. 
1 Nine Southern States were represented among the fifty-six students who were in 
attendance during the session of 1886-87. 
2In proof of the general excellence of this department of Clark University, we 
quote the following from Dr. Atticus G. Haygood, who is already familiar to the 
public as the author of Our Brother in Black. He says: “It is to be questioned 
whether any single institution under the care of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
holds a place of importance and responsibility equal to that which is possible to the 
Gammon School of Theology. * * * It may well be questioned whether any sin- 
gle institution in the Southern States could not be better spared. * * * I think 
I may say without exaggeration that the Gammon School of Theology is, in many 
respects, the most important single experiment made by Protestantism in this coun- 
try—so far as I know in any country—in the momentous matter of teaching and 
training colored preachers.” See also Catalogue of Gammon School of Theology for 
1888, pp. 3-9.

There are five literary societies in the institution, prominent among 
which is the theological and debating society of the Gammon School of 
Theology. 
SPELMAN SEMINARY. 
This institution, designed especially for the instruction of colored wo- 
men and girls, was opened in the basement of the Friendship Baptist 
Church, in the city of Atlanta, April 11, 1881, by the present principals, 
Misses Sophia B. Packard and Hattie E. Giles, who were commissioned 
by the Woman’s American Baptist Home Mission Society of Boston. 
There the work of education was carried on for nearly two years. 
The school began with eleven pupils. The aggregate number in at- 
tendance during the seven years of its existence has been over 3,580 
, pupils, six hundred and nine names appearing on the 1887-88 register. 
The faculty at present comprises twenty-seven teachers, beside as- 
sistants; and the course of study embraces preparatory, normal, and sci- 
entific or higher normal courses. Musical and industrial departments 
are also connected with the seminary, and a training school for nurses, 
established in 1886, is among the advantages which it affords. 
The present property of the school, which is valued at over eighty 
thousand dollars, consists of several acres of land, four double houses, 
Rockefeller Hall, and the large brick building which is now being erected 
to take the place of Union Hall, destroyed by fire in June of the past 
year (1887). 
THE PAINE INSTITUTE.’ 
“They (the colored Methodist Episcopal churches) have no institution 
under their management for the education of those who are to oceupy 
their pulpits and preside in their schools. Their preachers and teach- 
ers, if educated at all, must for the most part be educated by those who 
are not in sympathy with their organization. If they are to make any 
progress, or even to maintain their existence, they must provide for the 
education of those who are to take charge of their schools and religious. 
congregations. They have neither the money to establish schools, nor 
the men competent to conduct them; and they look to us for aid.” 
Such was the language of the committee on education in the Gen- 
eral Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church South. It was to 
meet the necessities of the case, and to carry out the provision as in- 
troduced by the General Conference of 1882, that the Paine Institute

was organized. Located at Augusta, it was opened in January, 1884, 
and is now in the fifth year of its operations. Rev. Morgan Calloway, 
D. D., vice-president of Emory College, was its first president. The 
present incumbent in that position is Rev. George Williams Walker, A. 
M. He is assisted by four teachers. The course of study comprises a 
normal, a theological, and an industrial department; the first occu- 
pies four years and the second three, while the industrial department 
affords instruction in printing and carpentry. There is also a music 
class in the school. 
The register for the session just closing (1887-88) shows an attend- 
ance at the institute of one hundred and thirty-three pupils of both 
sexes. Of these, one hundred and three are pursuing normal, and 
twenty-four theological courses. The class in music numbers fifteen. 
The property of the institution consists of ten acres of good land and 
three buildings; one of these is the home for the teachers, another the 
home of the matron, while the third bas been arranged for class-rooms 
anda dormitory for boys. 
MORRIS-BROWN COLLEGE. 
This college, as it is called, is principally indebted for its existence 
to the African Methodist Episcopal Church of the State of Georgia. 
In 1880 the ministers of that organization, realizing the necessity for 
an institution which would not only educate and prepare their young men 
for the ministry and their young women for Christian work, but which 
would also prove an industrial training school for both sexes, deter- 
mined upon the erection of the Morris-Brown College. In February of 
the following year the present site, overlooking the city of Atlanta, was 
purchased ; and in 1884 the foundation of the east wing of the college 
was laid. It was completed in November, 1885, at a cost of nine thou- 
sand dolJars. Thirty-five hundred dollars were expended in the pur- 
chase of the grounds; and itis said that about eighteen thousand dollars 
in addition will be needed to finish and thoroughly equip the building. 
On the 15th of October, 1885, the institution was opened to students, 
and the attendance during its first session was one hundred and seven. 
The present number of pupils (session of 1887-88) is two hundred and 
eleven, of whom one hundred and nine are males and one hundred and 
two are females. The curriculum consists of a college preparatory and a 
normal course,—the former occupying three and the latter four years,— 
and of an English course. The faculty is composed of three teachers, 
Rey. E. W. Lee, B. A., being principal. Rev. W. J. Gaines, recently ap- 
pointed bishop, is the general superintendent, and it is to his efforts, 
perhaps, more than to those of any one else that the establishment of 
the Morris-Brown College is due,

  CONCLUSION. 
Thus have we endeavored, clearly and faithfully, to convey an im- 
pression of the opportunities afforded for the acquisition in Georgia, 
both of acommon school and of a higher education. We have attempted 
to revive the recollection of the schools of limited means and partial 
courses which ministered to the instruction of youth prior to the Rev- 
olution, and just after the close of that period of distraction and pov- 
erty. We have traced the development and decline of the poor school 
system. We have considered at length the inauguration and the pres- 
ent status of the public school system. We have noted the opportuni- 
ties afforded for the acquisition of higher education in the University 
of the State of Georgia and its branches, in various denominational uni- 
versities and colleges, and in sundry institutions inaugurated under the 
auspices of private benefactions. We have not omitted to mention all 
charitable institutions, and colleges designed to facilitate studies in law, 
medicine, theology, technology, science, and art. Ina word, we have 
been careful, so far as our inquiry could ascertain, to ignore the men- 
tion of no institution, however limited, the mission of which is to pro- 
mote the intellectual development of the community. 
Upon a review of the whole subject, we find cause for congratulation 
that Georgia, in her educational advantages, has made such signal prog- 
ress. Opportunities for acquiring superior learning are abundant and 
satisfactory; while through the generous provision made by the State 
for the support of her common schools,—supplemented by acts empow- 
ering cities and populous districts by local taxation to increase their 
numbers and render certain their sustentation,—the means of acquiring 
an elemeutary education requisite for the needs of every-day life are 
placed within the reach of all. Education in Georgia is now practically 
tree, and illiteracy should nowhere exist. In the benefits of these edu- 
cational advantages both races participate equitably. ach year bears 
testimony to the progress made in the intellectual training of the masses, 
and brings joy to the heart of the philanthropist. When we reflect upon 
the condition of affairs a quarter of a century ago; when we remem- 
ber the embarrassing questions which arose upon the conclusion of the 
Civil War; when we recall the general penury which pervaded the 
land, and the lack of money for the inauguration and sustentation of 
schemes of general benefit, and contrast the present attitude of things

and the development which has occurred, we are surprised and delighted 
at the tokens of benevolence, of order restored, of the recognition of 
relative rights, of domestic peace, of mental, moral, and political ad- 
vancement, and of intellectual progress, which confront us on every 
hand. Among the factors which have brought about this happy con- 
dition, none is so potent as the liberal provision made at the general 
charge for the inauguration and good support of common schools, and 
for rendering a university education within the limits of the Common- 
wealth practically free to all who desire to avail themselves of it. 
In the coat-of-arms of Georgia appear three emblematic columns, in- 
scribed respectively with the words, “ Wisdom, Justice, and Modera- 
tion,” and supporting an arch upon which is engraven, in bold relief, 
the word “ Constitution.” 
Rightly judging that the intelligence of the citizen and the education 
of the masses are indispensable prerequisites to the comprehension and 
maintenance of wise, just, and moderate views necessary for the under- 
standing and conservation of all constitutional rights and privileges, 
the General Assembly and the people of Georgia have made, and are 
making, most praiseworthy efforts to promote the general good, and 
render learning, both primary and liberal, popular and accessible within 
the limits of the Commonwealth.

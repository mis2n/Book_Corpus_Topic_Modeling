PREFACE 
Tux art of using one’s native tongue correctly and for- 
cibly is acquired for the most part through imitation and 
practice, and is’ not so much a matter of knowledge as of 
habit. As regards English, then, the first duty of our 
schools is to set before pupils excellent models, and, in all 
departments of school-work, to keep a watchful eye on 
the innumerable acts of expression, oral and written, which 
go to form habit. Since, however, pupils come to school 
with many of their habits of expression already formed on 
bad models, our schools must give some attention to the 
special work of pointing out common errors of speech, and 
of leading pupils to convert knowledge of these errors into 
new and correct habits of expression. This is the branch 
of English teaching in which this little book hopes to be 
useful. 
All the “Exercises in English” with which I am ac- 
quainted consist chiefly of “sentences to be corrected.” 
To such exercises there are grave objections. If, on the 
one hand, the fault in the given sentence is not seen at a 
glance, the pupil is likely, as experience has shown, to pass 
it by and to change something that is not wrong. If, on 
Nx TP 
 
-P-A-G-E-2
iv PREFACE 
the other hand, the fault is obvious, the exercise has no 
value in the formation of habit. Take, for example, two 
“sentences for correction” which I select at random from 
one of the most widely used books of its class: “I knew it 
was him,” and “Sit the plates on the table.” A pupil of 
any wit will at once see that the mistakes must be in 
“him” and “sit,” and knowing that the alternatives are 
“he” and “set,” he will at once correct the sentences 
without knowing, perhaps, why one form is wrong, the 
other right. He has not gained anything valuable ; he has 
simply “slid” through his exercise. Moreover, such “sen- 
tences for correction” violate a fundamental principle of 
teaching English by setting before the impressionable 
minds of pupils bad models. Finally, such exercises are 
unnatural, because the habit which we hope to form in 
our pupils is not the habit of correcting mistakes, but 
the habit of avoiding them. 
Correct English is largely a matter of correct choice be- 
tween two or more forms of expression, and in this book 
an attempt has been made, as a glance at the pages will 
show, to throw the exercises, whenever possible, into a form 
consistent with this truth. Though a pupil may change 
“who” to “whom” without knowing why, he cannot 
repeatedly choose correctly between these forms without 
strengthening his own habit of correct expression. 
This book has been prepared primarily as a companion 
to Professor A. 8. Hill’s “Foundations of Rhetoric,” in

use with that admirable work." Without the friendly en- 
couragement of Professor Hill the task would not have 
been undertaken, and to him above all others I am indebted 
for assistance in completing it. He has permitted me to 
draw freely on his published works ; he has provided me 
with advance sheets of the revised edition of ‘“ Principles 
of Rhetoric ;” he has put at my disposal much useful mate- 
rial gleaned from his own experience ; he has read the 
manuscript and proofs, and, without assuming any respon- 
sibility for shortcomings, he has suggested many improve- 
ments. I am also indebted to Mr. E. G. Coy, Headmaster 
of the Hotchkiss School, for many valuable suggestions, 
and to my colleague, Mr, J. E. Barss, for assistance in the 
proof-reading.

CHAPTER I. 
OF GOOD USE 
Way is it that for the purposes of English composition 
one word is not so good as another? To this question we 
shall get a general answer if we examine the effect of cer- 
tain classes of expressions. 
Present Use.—Let us examine first the effect produced 
by three passages in the authorized version of the Eng- 
lish Bible—a version made by order of King James in 
161 — 
“For these two years hath the famine been in the land; and yet 
there are five years, in the which there shall neither be eartng nor 
harvest ” (Gen. xlv. 6). 
“O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? 
how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing?” (Psa. iv. 2). 
‘Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I 
purposed to come unto you, but was let hitherto” (Rom. i. 18), 
See also Gen. xxv. 29; Matt. iii. 8; Acts viii.8; 1 Thess. iv. 15. 
An ordinary reader of our time cannot without assist- 
ance fully understand these passages, because the words 
“earing,” “leasing,” and “let”? convey to his mind either 
no idea at all or a wrong idea. Two hundred and eighty
-P-A-G-E-10
4 PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISH 
years ago, when this translation of the Bible was made, 
these words were common words with plain meanings; but 
» and “leasing” have since dropped out of com- 
mon use, and “let” has acquired a different meaning; con- 
sequently an ordinary reader of the present time must 
consult a dictionary before he can be sure what the pas- 
sages mean. Words and meanings which have gone out 
of use are called obsolete. There is not much temptation to 
use obsolete words; but the temptation sometimes comes, 
Therefore we note, as our first conclusion, that a person 
who wishes to be understood must avoid expressions and 
meanings which are not in present use. 
National Use.--A boy from southern Pennsylvania was 
visiting in New York State. In the midst of some prep- 
arations for a fishing excursion he said to his host, “Shall 
I take my gums along?” His host burst out laughing and 
said, “Of course; did you think of taking them out of 
your mouth and leaving them at home?”’ Unconsciously 
the boy had used a good English word in a sense peculiar 
to the district in which he lived; his host had understood 
the word in its proper sense. 
On another occasion a gentleman who had just arrived 
at a hotel in Kennebunkport, Me., agreed to a proposal to 
“go down to the beach in the barge.” , Going to his room, 
he prepared for a little excursion on the river which flowed 
by the hotel. When he returned, he was greatly surprised 
to find his friends about to start for the beach in a large 
omnibus. Another gentleman once asked a young lady to 
go “riding” with him. At the appointed hour he drove 
to her house in a buggy, and she came down to meet him 
in her riding habit. “ rh earing 
These incidents show that if we use expressions that

vation.
-P-A-G-E-11
    
OF GOOD USE b 
are only local, or use words in local senses, we are liable 
either to be misunderstood or not to be understood at all, 
Obscurity also arises from the use of words in senses which 
are peculiar to a certain class or profession. For example, 
to a person who is not familiar with commercial slang, 
this sentence from the market columns of a newspaper is a 
puzzle :— 
“Java coffees are dull and easy, though they are statistically 
strong.” 
The following directions for anchoring in a gale of wind 
are taken from a book called “ How to Sail a Boat” :— 
“When everything is ready, bring the yacht to the wind, and let 
the sails shake én the wind’s eye; and, so soon as she gets stern-way, 
let go the best bower anchor, taking care not to snub her too quickly, 
but to let considerable of the cable run out before checking her; then 
take a turn or two around the knight-heads,” etc. 
If a landsman’s safety depended on his understand- 
ing these directions, there would not be much hope for 
him, 
The following extract is from a newspaper report of a 
game of ball:— 
“Tn the eighth inning Anson jumped from one box into the other 
and whacked a wide one into extreme right. It was a three-base jolt 
and was made when Gastright intended to force the old man to first. 
The Brooklyns howled and claimed that Anson was out, but McQuaid 
thought differently. Both teams were crippled. Lange will be laid 
up for a week or so. One pitcher was batted out of the box.” 
This narrative may seem commonplace to school-boys, 
but to their mothers and sisters it must-seem alarm- 
ing. 
Our second conclusion, therefore, is that a person who 
wishes to be understood must avoid words and phrases that 
are not understood, and understood in the same sense, in
-P-A-G-E-12
6 PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISIL 
every part of the country, and in every class or profes- 
sion." 
Reputable Use.—Let us examine now the effect produced 
by a third kind of expression, namely, words and phrases 
“not used by writers and speakers of established reputa- 
tion.”* Let us take as our illustrations the familiar ex- 
pressions, “He done it” and “Please set in this seat.” 
Each of these expressions is common at the present time, 
and its meaning is instantly clear to any one who speaks 
English. But these expressions, not being used by well- 
informed and careful speakers, produce in the mind of a 
well-informed hearer an impression of vulgarity like that 
which we get from seeing a person eat with his knife. In 
language, as in manners and fashions, the law is found in 
the custom of the best people; and persons who wish to 
be classed as cultivated people must speak and write like 
cultivated people. There is no moral wrong in a person’s 
saying “Please se¢ in this seat,” and if he does say it he 
will probably be understood; but persons who use this or 
any other expression which is not in reputable use run the 
risk of being classed as ignorant, affected, or vulgar. 
Good Use.—It appears, therefore, that words and phrases, 
in order to be proper expressions for use in English prose, 
(1) must be in common use at the present time; (2) they 
must be used, and used in the same sense, in every part 
of the country, and in every class and profession; (3) 
they must be expressions used by writers and speakers of 
established reputation. In other words, our expressions 
must be in present, national, and reputable use. Expres- 
sions which fulfil these three conditions are said to be in 
good use. 
The next question that presents itself to one who wishes 
1 A.S. Hill: Foundations of Rhetoric, p. 28. 
2 Thid., p. 20.
-P-A-G-E-13
  
OF GOOD USE 4 
to use English correctly is, How am I to know what words 
and expressions are in good use? 
Conversation and Good Use.—Good use cannot be de- 
termined solely by observing the conversation of our 
associates; for the chances are that they use many local 
expressions, some slang, and possibly some vulgarisms. 
“You often hear it” is not proof that an expression is in 
good use. 
Newspapers and Good Use.—Nor can good use be 
learned from what we see in newspapers. Newspapers of 
high rank contain from time to time, especially in their 
editorial columns, some of the best modern prose, and 
much literature that has become standard was first printed 
in periodicals; but most of the prose in newspapers is 
written necessarily by contributors who do not belong to 
the class of “speakers or writers whom the world deems 
the best.” As the newspaper in its news records the life 
of every day, so in its style it too frequently records the 
slang of daily life and the faults of ordinary conversation. 
A newspaper contains bits of English prose from hundreds 
of different pens, some skilled, some unskilled; and this 
jumble of styles does not determine good use, 
No one Book or Writer Decisive.—Nor is good use to 
be learned from our favorite author, unsupported by other 
authority; not even, as we have seen, from the English 
Bible, when it stands alone. No writer, even the greatest, 
is free from occasional errors ; but these accidental slips are 
not to be considered in determining good use. Good use 
is decided by the prevailing usage of the writers whose 
works make up permanent English literature, not by their 
inadvertencies. “The fact that Shakspere uses a word, or 
Sir Walter Scott, or Burke, or Washington Irving, or who- 
ever happens to be writing earnestly in Melbourne or Sid- 
ney, does not make it reputable. The fact that all five of
-P-A-G-E-14
8 PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISH 
these authorities use the word in the same sense would go 
very far to establish the usage. On the other hand, the 
fact that any number of newspaper reporters agree in 
usage does not make the usage reputable. The style of 
newspaper reporters is not without merit; it is very rarely 
unreadable; but for all its virtue it is rarely a well of Eng- 
lish undefiled.” * 
“Reputable use is fixed, not by the practice of those 
whom A or B deems the best speakers or writers, but by 
the practice of those whom the world deems the best,— 
those who are in the best repute, not indeed as to thought, 
but as to expression, the manner of communicating thought. 
The practice of no one writer, however high he may stand 
in the public estimation, is enough to settle a point; but 
the uniform or nearly uniform practice of reputable speak- 
ers or writers is decisive.” * 
Good Reading the Foundation of Good Speaking and 
Writing.—To the question how to become familiar with 
good use the first answer is, read the best literature. 
Language, like manners, is learned for the most part by 
imitation ; and a person who is familiar with the language 
of reputable writers and speakers will use good English 
without conscious effort, just as a child brought up among 
refined people generally has good manners without know- 
ing it. Good reading is indispensable to good speaking or 
writing. Without this, rules and dictionaries are of no 
avail. In reading the biographies of eminent writers, it is 
interesting to note how many of them were great readers 
when they were young; and teachers can testify that 
the best writers among their pupils are those who have 
read good literature or who have been accustomed to 
hear good English at home. The student of expression

-P-A-G-E-15
  
OF GOOD USE 9 
should begin at once to make the acquaintance of good 
literature. 
The Use of Dictionaries.—To become acquainted with 
good literature, however, takes a long time; and to decide, 
by direct reference to the usage of the best writers, every 
question that arises in composition, is not possible for be- 
ginners. In certain cases beginners must go to dictionaries 
to learn what good use approves. Dictionaries do not make 
good use, but by recording the facts learned by professional 
investigators they answer many questions regarding it. To 
one who wishes to speak and write well a good dictionary 
is indispensable. 
“The Foundations of Rhetorie.”’— Dictionaries, however, 
are not always a suflicient guide; for, being records, they 
aim to give all the senses in which a word is used, and 
do not always tell which sense is approved by the best 
usage. Large dictionaries contain many words which 
have gone out of good use and other words which have not 
yet come into good use. Moreover, they treat of words 
only, not of constructions and long expressions. Additional 
help in determining good use is required by beginners, and 
this help is to be found in such books as Professor A. 8. 
Hill’s “Foundations of Rhetoric.” The investigations of 
a specialist are there recorded in a convenient form, with 
particular reference to the needs of beginners and of those 
who have been under the influence of bad models. Com- 
mon errors are explained and corrected, and the funda- 
mental merits of good expression are set forth and illus- 
trated. 
Purpose of these Exereises.—In the following exercises, 
which are intended for drill on some of these elements of 
good expression, care has been taken to put the questions 
into the forms in which they arise in actual composition. 
The notes which precede the exercises are only hints; for

full discussions of the principles involved the student must. 
consult larger works. 
Some Convenient Names 
Barparisms: Words and 
phrases not English; ze. 
not authorized by good 
English use. The name 
comes from a Greek 
word meaning ‘“ for- 
eign,” ‘“‘strange.” 
IMPROPRIETIES: Good | 
English wordsor phrases 
used in wrong senses: 
as, “I guess V’'ll go to 
bed;’ ‘‘He is stopping 
for a week at the Berk- 
  shire Inn.” Phrases that have gone out of use, said 
to be ARCHAIC or OBSOLETE. 
Brand-new words which have not be- 
come established in good use: as, ‘‘bur- 
glarize,” ‘‘ enthuse,” ‘‘clectrocute.” 
Phrases introduced from foreign coun- 
tries (called FOREIGNISMS, ALIENISMS), or 
peculiar to some district or province 
(called PRovincraLisms). A phrase in- 
troduced from France is called a Galli- 
cism, from England, an Anglicism. A 
phrase peculiar to America is called an 
Americanism. Similarly we have the 
terms Latinism, Hellenism, Teutonism, 
etc. All these names may be applied 
also to certain kinds of Improprieties 
and Solecisms. 
Most errors in the use of English 
are Improprieties, which are far more 
common than Barbarisms and Sole- 
cisms. No classification of them is here 
attempted. 
SonEcrsms: Constructions not English, commonly called cases of 
“bad grammar” or “ false syntax”: as, ‘‘ She invited Mrs. Roe and 
I to go driving with her.” ‘‘Solecism” is derived from Soli, the 
name of a Greek tribe who lived in Cilicia and spoke bad Greek. 
SianG is a general name for current, vulgar, unauthorized language. 
It may take the form of barbarism, impropriety, or solecism. 
A CoLtoguiatism is an expression peculiar to familiar conversa- 
tion. 
A Vuucarism is an expression peculiar to vulgar or ignorant 
people.

by sound, not by spelling. Before a consonant sound “a” 
is used ; before a vowel sound “an” is used.

Put the proper form, “a” or “an,” before each of these expres- 
sions :—Elephant, apple, egg, union of states, uniform, uninformed

high hill, horse, honorable career, hypocrite, humble spirit, honest 
boy, hypothesis, history, historical sketch, Keir, hundred, hereditary

/ The or A’*—“ The” is a broken-down form of the old 
ve English thet, from which we also get “that,” and is used 
to point out some particular person, thing, or class: as, 
4 “ The headmaster of the school gaye the boys permission.” 
/ When “the” is used before the name of a particular class 
of persons or things it is called the “ generic” article (from 
genus, “a class”): as, “None but the brave deserve the 
fair”; “ Zhe eagle is our national bird.” 
“An” (“a”) is a broken-down form of the old English 
word ane, meaning “one.” It is properly used when the 
object is thought of as one of a class: as, “There is an 
eagle in the zoological garden.” It cannot properly be used 
before a word which is used as a class name, because a class 
name includes in its meaning more than “ one.”

tl OF ARTICLES : 13 
Superfluous and ome Articles.'—The use of a super- 
fluous “a” or “an” before a class name, especially after 
the words “ arb and “kind,” is a common and obstinate 
error. We may say, “This is an eagle,” meaning “one 
eagle.” But we may not say, “Am eagle is our national 
bird,” “This is a rare kind of an cagle,” or, “It is not 
worthy of the name of an eagle”; because in these sen- 
tences “eagle” is used as the name, not of a single bird, but 
of a class of birds, and includes in its meaning all the birds 
which belong to the class called “eagle.” The sentences 
are equivalent to: “The kind of bird called ‘eagle’ is our 
national bird ;” “This is a rare species of the class of birds 
called ‘eagle;’” “It is not worthy of the name given to the 
birds which belong to the class called ‘ eagle.’ ”

  CHAPTER III. 
OF NOUNS 
How to Form the Possessive Case.'—As a rule, the pos-, 
sessive of nouns in the stnGuLar number is formed by add- 
ing an apostrophe and “s” (’s): as, “The boy’s coat.” 
Often the pronunciation of the added “s” makes a new 
syllable; and if this additional syllable makes an unpleas- 
ant sound, the possessive is indicated by the apostrophe 
alone (’): as, “For goodness’ sake.” The putting in or 
the leaving out of the “s” in such cases is chiefly a matter 
of taste. If the “s” is sounded, it is always written; and 
whenever there is doubt, it is well to follow the regular 
rule: as, “ Horace’s odes,” “ Charles’s ball,” “ Dickens’s 
David Copperfield.” 5 
In the prurat number, when the nominative plural ends 
in “s,” the possessive case is formed by adding an apos- 
trophe alone (’). If the nominative plural does not end in 
“s.” an apostrophe and an “s” (’s) are both added, as in 
the singular: as, “ A/en’s and boys’ shoes.” 
The possessive case of compounpD nouns and expressions 
used as compound nouns is formed by adding the proper 
sign of the possessive to the end of the compound: as, 
“That is my séster-in-law’s pony,” “This is the Prince of 
Wales’s palace.”

Singular and Plural.’'—In modern English most nouns 
form the plural by adding ‘“‘s” to the singular. The fol- 
‘lowing variations from this rule are important:— 
ff 1. When the added sound of ‘‘s” makes an additional syllable, 
/ // es” is used: as, box, boxes; church, churches. 
2. Nouns ending in “o.” If the final ‘‘o” is preceded by a vowel, 
the plural is formed regularly, ¢.e., by adding ‘‘s”: as, cameo, cameos. 
If the final ‘‘o” is preceded by a consonant; the tendency of modern 
usage is to form the plural by adding ‘4es”: as, hero, heroes; pota- 
to, potatoes. The following common words, however, seem still to 
form the plural by adding ‘‘s” alone:—   
canto lasso proviso torso 
duodecimo memento quarto tyro 
halo octavo solo 
junto piano stiletto 
8. Nouns ending in “y.” If the “y” is preceded by a vowel, the 
plural is regular: as, valley, valleys. 
If the ‘‘y” is preceded by a consonant, ‘‘y” is changed to ‘i” and 
“es” is added to form the plural: as, lady, ladies; city, cities. 
4, Proper nouns are changed as little as possible: as, Henry, 
Henrys; Mary, Marys; Cicero, Ciceros; Nero, Neros. 
5. Most compound nouns form the plural by adding the proper 
sign of the plural to the fundamental part of the word, ¢.¢., to the 
part which is described by the rest of the phrase: as, ox-cart, ox- 
carts; court-martial, courts-martial; aide-de-camp, aides-de-camp. 
Note the difference between the plural and the possessive of compound 
nouns,—forms which are often confounded. See page 16.

  6. Letters, figures, and other symbols are made plural by adding

7. Some nouns have two plurals, which differ in meaning :—

Misused Nouns.’—Many errors in English consist in us-

bad English, should be avoided as we avoid bad manners. 
In the following definitions and exercises a few nouns’ are 
selected for study. The distinctions given are not always 
observed by reputable authors, but they indicate the ten- 
dency of the best modern usage. 
I, A RESEMBLANCE IN SENSE MISLEADS.? 
House, home.—A. house is a buildmg. Home means one’s habitual 
abode, ‘‘ the abiding place of the affections.” It may or may not be 
An a house, and it may include the surroundings of a house.

persons, or, in legal usage, a person who is concerned in a contention 
or agreement, 
Series, suecession.—A series is a succession of similar things mutu- 
ally related according to some law. Succession is properly used of 
several things following one after the other; it denotes order of oc- 
currence only, and does not imply any connection. 
Statement, assertion.—A statement is a formal setting forth of fact 
or opinion; an assertion is simply an affirmation of fact or opinion. 
Verdict, testimony.—A verdict is a decision made by a number of 
men acting asa single body. Testimony is an expression of individ- 
ual knowledge or belief. 
The whole, all.—Z%e whole is properly used of something which is

Il. A RESEMBLANCE IN SOUND MISLEADS.! 
Acceptance, acceptation.— Acceptance is the “act of accepting”; also 
‘favorable reception”: as, ‘‘ The acceptance of a gift,” ‘“‘She sang 
with, marked acceptance.”  Acceptation now means “‘the sense in 
which an expression is generally understood or accepted.” 
Access, accession.— Access has several meanings authorized by good 
use: (1) outburst; (2) admission; (8) way of entrance. Accession 
means (1) the coming into possession of a right; or (2) an addition. 
“acts, actions.—‘‘ Acés, in the sense of ‘things done,’ is preferable to 
actions, since actions also means ‘ processes of doing.’”? 
Advanee, advancement.—Advance is used in speaking of something 
as moving forward ; advancement, as being moved forward. 
“allusion, illusion, delusion.—An allusion is an indirect reference to 
something not definitely mentioned. Roughly speaking, an dlusion 
is an error of vision; delusion, of judgment. ‘In literary and popu- 
lar use an dusion is an unreal appearance presented in any way to 
the bodily or the mental vision ; it is often pleasing, harmless, or 
even useful. . . . A delusion is a mental error or deception, and may 
have regard ie things actually existing, as well as to dllusions, De- 
lusions are ordinarily repulsive and discreditable, and may even be 
mischievous.” * 
Avoeation, vocation.— ‘‘ Vocation means ‘calling’ or ‘profession’; 
avocation, ‘something aside from one’s regular calling, a by-work.’”*

Solicitude, solicitation.—Solicitude is ‘‘anxiety”; solicttation is ‘‘ the

Possessive forms.'—No apostrophe is used in forming 
the possessive case of personal pronouns. We write 
“ours,” “yours,” “hers,” “its,” “theirs.” “It’s” is a con- 
traction for “it is.”

Nominative or Objeetive Case.-—There are only seven 
words in the English language that now have different 
forms for the nominative and objective cases; therefore it 
is only in the use of these words that we need to observe 
any rules about “nominative” or “objective.” Since, how- 
ever, these seven words are more frequently used than any 
other words, the possibilities of error in choosing between the 
nominative and the objective are many. Mistakes of this 
kind are common, and produce a very unpleasant effect on 
cultivated people. The seven words that have different

Nominative. Objective, Nominative. Objective.

It is taken for granted that the student has already 
learned the following principles of syntax :— 
1. Words used absolutely and the subjects of finite verbs should in 
English be put in the NomrNaTIVE form. 
2. The subjects of infinitives and the objects of verbs and preposi- 
tions should be in the opsEcTIVE form. 
8. Words in apposition should be in the same case, 
4, The verb ‘‘to be,” or any of its forms (am, is, are, were, etc.), 
does not take an object, but, being equivalent in meaning to the sym- 
bol ‘‘ =,” takes the same case after it as before it: the nominative, 
if the form is ‘‘finite”; the objective, if the form is ‘‘infinitive” and 
has a subject of itsown. ‘I know it is he,” ‘‘I know it to be him,” 
and “The stranger is thought to be le” are grammatically correct. 
Sentences like “She invited Mrs. R. and J to go driving” 
are common, even among people generally well-informed. 
Such mistakes will be avoided if the speaker stops to think 
what the form would be if the pronoun were not coupled 
with a noun. No one would think of saying, “She in- 
vited J to go driving.” 
Persons who are in doubt as to which form of the pro- 
noun to use often try to avoid the difficulty by using one of 
the pronouns ending in “-self ”—pronouns which have the 
same form for both the nominative and the objective case. 
Thus many persons, uncertain whether to use “I” or 
“ ” me” in the sentence quoted above, would say instead, 
“She invited Mrs. R. and myself to go driving.” This is 
1T omit ye, you, because they are used interchangeably. I omit also 
compounds of who, whom.  
-P-A-G-E-51
OF PRONOUNS 45 
no better than “ Mrs. R. and J,” or “her and Z.” The pro- 
nouns in “-self” are properly used only for emphasis or in 
a reflexive sense.’ It is right to say: ‘I will go myself” ; 
“Carrie herself went to the door”; “God helps those who 
help themselves.” It would be wrong to say, “Harry and 
myself have bought a horse together.” 
When a pronoun in “-self” is used reflexively, it refers 
to the subject of the clause in which it stands. 
In sentences like “This advice is free to whoever will 
take it,” the word ending in “-ever” is the subject of the 
verb “will take,” not the object of the preposition “to.” 
The right form, therefore, is “ whoever,” not “ whomever.” 
The object or, better, the “base” of the preposition “to” 
is the whole clause, “ whoever will take it.”

  Pronouns before Verbal Nouns.'—Grammarians distin- 
guish three kinds of words formed from verbs by the add- 
ing of “-ing.” 
1. “We found Katharine singing a merry song.” In 
this sentence “singing ”—equivalent to “ who was singing ” 
—describes Katharine, and is therefore used as an adjec- 
tive; but it also partakes of the nature of a verb, for it has 
a direct object, “song.” Such words, partaking of the nat- 
ure of both adjective and verb, are called participius, 
2. “Blithely singing pretty songs keeps one’s spirits up.” 
  1 “Foundations,” pp. 62-64.
-P-A-G-E-57
  
OF PRONOUNS 51 
Here “singing” is a noun, the subject of the sentence; yet 
it has a direct object, “songs,” and is modified by the ad- 
verb “blithely.” Such wwords, partaking of the nature of 
both noun and verb, are called GERUNDS. 
A noun ora pronoun used béfore a gerund to denote the 
subject of the action should be put in the Possessive case. 
The reason for this becomes evident if, in the sentence “(Do 
you remember Katharine (Katharine’s) singing?” we 0 
stitute for the noun “singing ” another noun, “song ;” thus, 
“Do you remember Katharine (Katharine’s) song ?” The 
direct object of “remember” is “singing,” which is de- 
scribed by the possessive “ Katharine’s.” 
3. “Katharine’s blithe singing of merry songs helps to 
make home happy.” Here, too, “singing” is a noun; but 
now its verbal character has disappeared, for it is modified 
by an adjective “blithe,” and instead of a direct object we 
have the prepositional phrase “of merry songs.” Such 
words derived from verbs are ABSTRACT VERBAL NOUNS. 
When a word in “-ing” is modified by “the” or some 
other adjective, it is an abstract verbal noun, and cannot 
have an object. Conversely, if it is followed by “of” and 
a noun instead of by a direct object, it should be modified 
by “the” or some other adjective.

persons; which, of things; that, of either persons or things. 
As a rule, euphony decides between who or which and 
that. 
“Who is used chiefly of persons (though also often of the higher 
animals), wich almost only of animals and things (in old English 
also of persons), and that indifferently of either, except after a prep- 
osition, where only who [whom] or which can stand. Some recent 
authorities teach that only that should be used when the relative 
clause is limiting or defining: as, the man ¢Aat runs fastest wins the 
race ; but who or which when it is descriptive or co-ordinating: as, 
this man, who ran fastest, won the race; but, though present usage 
is perhaps tending in the direction of such a distinction, it neither 
has been nor is a rule of English specch, nor is it likely to become 
one, especially on account of the impossibility of setting that after a 
preposition ; for to turn all relative clauses into the form ‘the house 
that Jack lived in’ (instead of ‘the house in which Jack lived’) would 
be intolerable. In good punctuation the defining relative is distin- 
guished (as in the examples above) by never taking a comma before 
it, whether it be who or which or that. Wherever that could be prop- 
erly used, but only there, the relative may be, and very often is,

‘When the antecedent includes both persons and things, 
that is preferable to who or which. 
“When the antecedent is a neuter noun not personified, 
a writer should prefer of which to whose, unless euphony 
requires the latter.” ? 
What, as a relative pronoun, is equivalent to “that 
which.” It is never used with an antecedent, since the 
antecedent is included in the meaning of the word. 
The word as is a relative pronoun only after “such” or 
“same.” After “such” the proper relative is “as”; after 
“same” it is “as” or “that.” “ Same as usually expresses 
identity of kind,.same that absolute identity, except in con- 
tracted sentences where same as is alone found: cf. ‘he 
uses the same books as you do,’ ‘he uses the same books 
that you do,’ ‘he uses the same books as you.’”*

“neither,” “nobody.” Grammatically such expressions are 
singular.

of an unnecessary pronoun after the subject of a sentence.

Correct and Ineorreet Forms.'—It is not enough to 
learn by heart the “principal parts” of a verb; the habit 
of using them correctly should be acquired. The follow- 
ing verb-forms are often misused :— 
Present. Past Indicative, Past Participle. 
awake (intransitive) awoke awaked 
begin began begun 
beseech besought besought 
blow blew blown 
pid (‘‘to order,” “to greet”) bide bidden or bid 
bid (at auction) bid bidden or bid 
break broke broken? 
burst, burst. burst 
choose chose chosen 
come came come 
dive dived dived 
do did done 
drive drove driven 
eat ate eaten 
flee fled fled 
fly flew flown 
freeze froze frozen 
forget forgot forgotten 
get got got? 
go went gone 
hang hung, hanged hung, hanged‘! 
lay (‘‘ to cause to lie”) laid laid 
1 “Foundations,” pp. 78-81, 91-93. 
* “Broke,” as a form of the past participle, is still found in verse. 
® “Gotten” is an old form not sanctioned by the best modern usage. 
4 “Clothes are ‘hung’ on the line; men are ‘hanged’ on the gallows,” —

In using the verbs drink, ring, shrink, sing, sink, spring, 
swim, it seems better to confine the forms in “a” to the 
preterite tense, and the forms in “u” to the past partici- 
ple: as, “The bell rang five minutes ago”; “ Yes, the bell 
has rung.”* 
The following forms also should be distinguished :— 
Present. Past. Participle. 
i “to get down from,” “ to’ ; A alight ( Gemanes ) alighted alighted 
light (‘‘to ignite,” “to shed light on”) lighted* lighted® 
“to settle down as a bird from 
light ( flight,” or ‘‘to come upon) lighted orlit lighted or lit 
by chance”

Contractions.'—Some writers hold that in careful writing 
contracted forms should be avoided; but all are agreed 
that in conversation some contractions, if correctly used, 
are natural and proper. The conversation of a person who 
never said “can’t” for “can not,” “don’t” for “do not,” 
or “ doesn’t” for “ does not,” would seem stiff. Care should, 
however, be taken not to use plural contractions for sin- 
gular, or singular for plural. Don’t is a contraction of “do 
not,” doesn’t of “does not.” The proper contraction of 
“is not” is isn’t; of “are not,” aren't. Daresn’t, if used 
at all, should be used only when “dares not” might be 
substituted. Azn’t is a gross vulgarism. 
EXERCISE XLII.

May (might) or ean (could).’—Can and could, which de- 
note “ability ” or “possibility,” are often wrongly used in 
the place of may and might, which are the proper words 
to denote “ permission.” ‘

13. — I have the use of your sled? 
14, — I trouble you to get me a glass of water? 
  
Will or shall.'—Some grammarians teach that the future 
tense of “go” is: “I shall or will go,” “You shall or will 
go,” “He shall or will go,” etc. The fact seems to be that 
there is only one form for the future; the other form, 
often given as an alternative, expresses something more 
than futurity, and is somewhat like a distinct mode. 
A help to the proper use of shad and will is found in the 
original meaning of the words. At first shall and will were 
notional verbs,’ shall meaning “to owe,” “to be obliged,” 
and will meaning “to wish :” as, “That faith I shall (owe) 
to God.”* At present shail and will often retain some trace 
of their original meaning, wil implying a reference to the 
will of the subject, and shall implying obligation or com- 
pulsion : as, “I 2d follow him to the end ;” “He shall be 
brought to justice ;” sometimes they are mere auxiliaries, 
with no trace of their original meaning: as, “It ewéd rain 
to-day ;” “I shall be glad.” 
1 “Foundations,” pp. 83-88. 
? By “notional verb” is meant a verb that has some distinct idea or notion 
of its own: as, “I have a ball.” Here “have” expresses the idea of posses- 
sion. In the sentence “I have lost my ball,” the word “have” does not 
express a distinct idea; it only helps to form a tense of the verb “lose”: 
that is, it is not notional, but auxiliary. * Chaucer.
-P-A-G-E-79
  OF VERBS %3 
For practical purposes the distinction between shall and 
will may be exhibited as follows :— 
I, IN INDEPENDENT SENTENCES. 
Simple Futurity. Volition, 
implying that the matter is within 
the control of the speaker. 
I (we) shall I (we) will 
you will! go. you shall? go. 
he (they) wild he (they) shall? 
II, IN DEPENDENT SENTENCES. 
In noun clauses introduced by “that,” expressed or un- 
derstood, if the noun clause and the principal clause have 
different subjects, the distinction between shall and will is 
the same as in independent sentences : as, 
My sister says (that) Dorothy wé/ be glad to go with us. (Futur- 
ity; the same as, “ Dorothy w7dl be glad to go with us.”) 
My sister says (that) Dorothy shalé not be left behind. (Volition; 
the same as, ‘‘ Dorothy shall not be left behind.’’) 
In all other dependent clauses, shail is in all persons the~ 
proper auxiliary to express simple futurity ;/7¢ in all per- 
sons implies an exercise of will on the part of the subject 
of the clause: as, 
Dorothy says (that) she shall (futurity) be able to go with us. 
She says (that) she 272d (volition) meet us at the corner. 
If Bessie will come (volition), we will try to make her visit pleasant. 
When He shall appear (futurity) we shall be like Him. 
Remanx.—It is worthy of notice that in noun clauses introduced by “that” 
—clauses which are really indirect quotations—the same auxiliary is gener- 
ally used that would be used were the quotation in the direct form: as, “ My 
sister says, ‘Dorothy will be glad to go with you,’” “My sister says that 
Dorothy will be glad to go with us;” “Dorothy says, ‘I shall be glad to go 
with you,’” “Dorothy says that she shall be glad to go with us.” This re- 
mark, however, is not an adequate statement of the best usage, for it is not 
true of such sentences as 21, p. 76, and 8, 22, p. 77. 
1 Sometimes used in a courteous command to a subordinate officer. 
2 Also used in speaking of what is destined to take place, or of what is 
willed by some ruling power.

Til. IN QUESTIONS. 
In the first person “ will” is never proper, except when it 
repeats a question asked by another person. “ Will I go?” 
would mean, “Is it my intention to go?”—a useless ques- 
tion, since the speaker must know his own will without 
asking. 
In the second and third persons the auxiliary which is 
expected in the answer should be used. 
Would or should." Will you dine with me to-morrow? Iwill. (Volition.) 
Shall you be glad to come? I shall. (Futurity.) 
Will your brother be there, too? He will. (Futurity.)

Questions of Tense.’—The tense of a verb should cor- 
rectly express the time referred to. Most errors in the use 
of tenses are violations of some one of the following prin- 
ciples, which are established by good usage :— 
1. Principal verbs referring to the same time should be 
in the same tense. 
2. The perfect indicative represents something as now 
completed—as begun in the past but continuing till the 
present, at least in its consequences: as, “I have lost my 
book” (so that now I do not have it); “This house has 
stood for ninety years” (it is still standing); “ Bishop 
Brooks has died, but he has left us his example” (he is not 
now among us, but we have his example). 
8. The tense of the verb in a dependent clause varies 
with the tense of the principal verb :? as, 
I know he will come. 
I knew he would come. 
T have taken the first train, that I may arrive early. 
I had taken the first train, that I might arrive early. 
Blanche will be frightened if she sces the bat. 
Blanche would be frightened if she saz the bat. 
Blanche would have been frightened if she had seen the bat. 
Present facts and unchangeable truths, however, should 
be expressed in the present tense, regardless of the tense 
of the principal verb: as, “What did you say his name 
ig?” 
4, The perfect infinitive is properly used to denote action 
which is completed at the time denoted by the principal 
verb: as, “I am glad to have seen Niagara Falls ;” “He 
felt sorry to have hurt your feelings.” 
Exception. — Ought, must, need, and should (in the sense of “ ought”) 
have no distinctive form to denote past.time; with these verbs present

time is denoted by putting the complementary infinitive in the present 
tense, past time is denoted by putting the complementary infinitive in the 
perfect tense: as, “You ought to go,” “You ought to have gone ;” “He 
should de careful,” “He should have been careful.” A similar change from 
the present to the perfect infinitive is found after could and might in some 
of their uses: as, “I could go,” “I could have gone ;” “You might an- 
swer,” “You might have answered.”

Indicative or Subjunctive.'—The modern tendency to 
drop the subjunctive is unfortunate, for the distinction be- 
tween the subjunctive and the indicative is too useful to be 
abandoned.” ‘A knowledge of the difference between these 
modes in English is especially important in view of the 
difficulty which pupils complain of in mastering the uses 
of the Latin subjunctive or the Greek subjunctive and op- 
tative.® For these reasons more space is given to the sub- 
junctive in this book than would be called for by a mere 
discussion of modern English usage. 
+ “Foundations,” pp. 98-101. 
2 “Some people seem to think that the subjunctive mood is as good as 
lost, that it is doomed, and that its retention is hopeless. If its function 
were generally appreciated, it might even now be saved. .. . If we lose the 
Subjunctive Verb, it will certainly be a grievous impoverishment to our 
literary language, were it only for its value in giving variation to diction— 
and I make bold to assert that the writer who helps to keep it up deserves 
public gratitude.”—John Earle: English Prose, its Elements, History, and 
Usage, p. 172.

OF VERBS 83 
Forms of the Subjunctive.—In form the English subjunc- 
tive differs from the indicative in several ways :— 
1. In the single case of the verb ¢o be there are distinct 
forms for the present and past tenses, namely :— 
Present. Past. 
ic we 1 were, we

Exampies.—“ See that my room be! got ready at once.” “TI will work 
you a banner if you de! victorious.” “The headsman feels if the axe be!

judged.” “Twill beard them, though they de! more fanged than wolves and 
bears.” “If I were you, I would not say that.” “If you were more studi- 
ous, you would rank high.” ‘ Would that my parents zeve here!” 
2. In other verbs the subjunctive form is distinguishable 
from the indicative in the second and third persons singu- 
lar by the absence of the personal endings -tA, -s, or -st: as, 
Present Indicative: I have, thou hast, he has (hath). 
Subjunctive : I have, thou have, he have. 
Past Indicative: 1 had, thou hadst, he had. 
Subjunetive: I had, thou had, he had.     
Present Indicative : I come, thou comest, he comes (cometh).

difficult questions of Latin syntax might be examined in the field of Eng- 
lish, if only we were careful to treat our English critically. Whereas most 
grammars cut the ground from under them by denying the existence of a 
Subjunctive Mood. Until teachers recognize generally that, in such a sen- 
tence as ‘If he had done it, it had been better,’ we have a Subjunctive in 
both clauses, and a sentence essentially different from ‘If he had loved her ; 
before, he now adored her,’ English must forfeit half its valué both as_a |

/ \man.”—From a report of a Lecture by Prof. Sonnenschein, of the Mason 
\College, quoted in Earle’s “English Prose,” p. 55.

Exampirs.— Long live the king!” “If thou go, see that thou offend 
not.” “It is better he die.” “Though he slay me, yet will I trust him.” 
“Unless he behave! better, he will be punished.” “If I will that he ¢arry' 
till I come, what is that to thee?” ‘Govern well thy appetite, lest sin su- 
prise thee.” “If my sister saw this snake, she would be frightened.” “I 
wish I knew where Charles is.” 
The perfect and pluperfect subjunctives are of course 
formed by means of the subjunctive present and past tenses 
of “have.” : 
3. Very often, instead of the simple subjunctive forms, 
we use auxiliary verbs—may (past, might) and would or 
should—to express the subjunctive idea. “May” (“might”) 
is common as an equivalent for the subjunctive mode in 
clauses denoting a purpose, a wish, a hope, or a fear: as, 
“Bring him the book; that he may read to us ;” “ May he 
rest in peace ;” “I hope you may succeed ;” “They were 
afraid we might lose the way.” ‘ Would” and “should” 
are common substitutes for all tenses of the subjunctive: 
as, “ Walk carefully lest you (stumble) should stumble ;” 
“If he (come) should come, he will find me at home ;” “It 
(were) would be better if he (went) should go alone ;” “If 
my sister had seen this mouse, she (had been) would have 
been frightened.” In these sentences either the form in 
parenthesis or the italicized form is correct, though the lat- 
ter is more common, 
Nore.—It does not follow that the verbs “ may,” “ would,” and “should” 
always express the subjunctive idea. In the following sentences, for in- 
stance, they express the indicative idea: “You may (i.e, are permitted to) 
stay an hour;” “ You should (ic. ought to) be punctual ;” “Edith would 
not (ée. was unwilling to) come.” In such sentences “may,” “should,” 
and “would” make simple statements of fact. 
Uses of the Subjunetive-—The indicative form is used 
in expressing a fact or what is assumed to be a fact: as, 
“Ve thinks he is ill ;” the subjunctive form indicates some

uncertainty or doubt in the speaker’s mind: as, “ Whether 
it rain or not, I will gp.” 
The subjunctive idea occurs most frequently, perhaps, in 
conditional sentences, . A conditional sentence is one that 
contains a condition or supposition. A supposition may 
refer to present, past, or future time. If it refers to pres- 
ent or past time, it may be viewed by the speaker as true, 
untrue, or as a mere supposition with nothing implied as 
to its truth; if it refers to the future, it may be viewed as 
either likely or unlikely. A supposition which is assumed 
to be true, or which is made without any hint as to its cor- 
rectness, is expressed by the indicative. A supposition 
which is viewed by the speaker as untrue or unlikely is 
expressed by the subjunctive or a periphrase’ for the sub- 
junctive. When the character of the supposition makes 
the conclusion untrue or unlikely, the conclusion also is ex- 
pressed by the subjunctive or a periphrase’ for the sub- 
junctive. The use of tenses is peculiar, as will be seen from 
the following table of a few common forms of conditional 
sentences. The tenses should be carefully noted :— 
If it rains (és raining) now, I am sorry. B 
6 Present indicative: A simple supposition without any hint as to its correctness. 
5 If it rained (were raining), I should be sorry. 
a Past subjunctive, both clauses: The speaker implies that it is not raining. 
_ {TE it rained (was raining), I was sorry. 
§ Past indicative: No suggestion of doubt. 
fa | If it had rained, I should have been sorry. 
Past perfect subjunctive, both clauses: The speaker implies that it did not rain, 
If it rains, I shall be sorry. 
A Present indicative: The common, though inexact, form of a simple future sup- 
2 | If it rain, I shall be sorry. [position. 
B Present subjunctive: Less common, but more exact. The future is uncertain. 
fe, | If it should (were to) rain, I should be sorry. 
Subjunctive, both clauses: The uncertainty is emphasized by the auxiliary form; 
the chances of rain seem more remote. 
1 See paragraph 8, page 84. The forms in “would” and “should” in 
conditional sentences, though they express the subjunctive idea, can hardly 
be called the “subjunctive mood.” Sometimes they are called the “con- 
ditional mood.”

  86 PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISII 
Nore 1.—When é/ is equivalent to “whenever,” the condition is called 
“general,” to distinguish it from “ particular” conditions, which refer to 
some particular act at some particular time. General conditions always 
take the indicative: as, “If (whenever) it rains, I stay at home.” 
Nore 2.—Sometimes there is no “if,” and then the verb or a part of the 
verb precedes the subject: as, “Were it raining, I should be sorry ;” 
“Had it been raining, I should have been sorry.” 
Nore 3.—In such sentences as “If thou hadst been here, my brother had 
not died,” it may perhaps be questioned whether “had not died” is indica- 
tive, as in the Greek, or subjunctive, as in the Latin, idiom. 
Nore 4.—Clauses introduced by though and unless take the same forms 
as clauses introduced by if. 
Wishes are naturally expressed in the subjunctive. The 
present subjunctive denotes a wish for the future: as, 
“Thy kingdom come.” The past subjunctive denotes a 
wish for the present which is unfulfilled: as, “I wish I 
were a bird.” The past perfect subjunctive denotes a wish 
contrary to a past fact: as, “I wish you had been there.”

Singular or Plural.'—The following principles, estab- 
lished by good usage, writers or speakers are liable to for- 
get:— 
1. The expressions each, every, many a, either, and neither 
are singular. 
2. When the subject consists of singular nouns or pro- 
nouns connected by or, edther—or, or neither—nor, the verb 
must be singular. 
8. Words joined to the subject by with, together with, in 
addition to, or as well as, are not a part of the grammatical 
subject, but are parenthetical, and therefore do not affect 
the number of the verb. 
4, Since a relative pronoun has the number and person 
of its antecedent, a verb whose subject is a relative pro- 
noun agrees in person and number with the antecedent of 
the relative. 
5. “ When the subject though plural in form is singular 
in sense, the verb should be singular; when the subject 
though singular in form is plural in sense, the verb should 
be plural:”? as, “‘Gulliver’s Travels’ was written by 
Swift ;” “Five hundred dollars és a large sum ;” “Half of 
them are gone.” 
6. “A collective noun, when it refers to the collection 
as a whole, is singular in sense, and therefore requires a 
singular verb; when it refers to the individual persons or 
things of the collection, it is plural and requires a plural 
verb.” *

Il. A RESEMBLANCE IN SENSE MISLEADS.’ 
  Antagonize, oppose.—To antagonize means properly ‘“‘to struggle 
against,” ‘‘to oppose actively,” or ‘‘to counteract.” ‘In England, 
antagonizing forces must be of the same kind, but in the political 
phraseology of the United States a person may antagonize (¢.¢., op- 
pose) a measure.” ? 
Calculate, intend.—To caleulate means properly “to compute math- 
ematically,” or “to adjust or adapt” for something. In the sense 
of ¢éntend it is not in good use. 
Carry, bring, fetch.—T’o cay means ‘‘ to take along in going;” to 
bring means ‘‘to take along in coming;” to fetch means “‘to go, get, 
and bring.” 
Champion, support.—The word champion is very much overworked, 
being often used in the general sense of ‘‘support.” It should be 
restricted to cases in which there is the idea of entering the lists as 
champion of a cause. 
Claim, assert, allege, maintain, declare, affirm, state.—To claim 
means properly ‘‘ to demand as one’s own or one’s due.” It is often 
loosely used, especially in the United States, for ‘‘assert,” “allege,” 
“maintain,” “declare,” or ‘‘affirm.” To assert is ‘‘to say or declare 
in the face of implied denial or doubt.” To allege is ‘‘ to assert with-

-P-A-G-E-101
  OF VERBS 95 
out proof.” To maintain is ‘‘to uphold by argument.” To declare 
is “to say publicly, clearly, or emphatically.” To afirm is ‘‘to assert 
on one’s reputation for knowledge or truthfulness.” To state, which 
is also often misused in the sense of ‘‘say,” ‘‘ assert,” ‘“‘ allege,” ‘‘de- 
clare,” or ‘‘aflirm,” means properly ‘to express formally and in de- 
tail;” it always implies detail. (See ‘‘Foundations,” pp. 118, 114, 
and “Practical Exercises,” p. 99.) 
Confess, admit.—‘“ Admit, in cases into which the idea of confession 
does not enter, is preferable to confess. On grounds of idiom, how- 
ever, ‘I must confess’ and the parenthetical ‘I confess’ are exempt 
from the operation of this rule.”’! 
Demand, ask.— Zo demand means ‘‘ to ask for with authority or with 
insistence.” The use of ‘‘demand” in the sense of ‘‘ask” is bor- 
rowed, possibly, from the French use of demander. 
Hire, let, lease.—7o hire means “‘to obtain the use of;” to let, ‘‘to 
give the use of.” o lease means ‘‘to give the use of by lease.” The 
owner of a house leases it; the person who occupies it takes a lease 
of it. 
Learn, teach.—Lea7n means to ‘‘acquire” knowledge, not to ‘‘im- 
part” it. In the latter sense the proper word is teach. 
““T have more information to-day than I had before,” said Mr. Sheehan. 
“This has learned you something,” said Mr. Goff. 
“Oh no,” replied Mr, Sheehan, “it has taught me something.” * 
Like, love.—Like and love differ greatly in strength or warmth, and 
may differ in kind. ike may be feeble and cool, and it never has 
the intensity of love. We may lke or even love a person; we only 
like the most palatable kind of food. With an infinitive, /éke is the 
common word, love being appropriate only in the hyperbole of poet- 
ical or rhetorical feeling.* 
Materialize, appear.—Zo materialize properly means ‘‘to make or 
to become physically perceptible :” as, ‘‘ by means of letters we ma- 
terialize our ideas and make them as lasting as ink and paper ;” 
“the ideas of the sculptor materialize in marble.” 
Plead, argue.—Sce plea, argument, p. 29. 
Stay, stop.—‘‘“Stay, as in ‘ At what hotel are you staying ? is prefer- 
able to stop, since stop also means ‘to stop without staying.’”+

CHAPTER VI. 
OF ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS 
AN Apsrctive is a word joined by way of description or 
limitation to a noun or a pronoun. 
An ADVERB is a word joined by way of limitation or em- 
phasis to a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. 
Vulgarisms.'—Every educated person is expected to 
know the correct use of the following words :— 
Good, well.—Good is an adjective; the adverb corresponding to it 
is well. We say, ‘‘He had a good sleep;” ‘‘He slept well.” Well is 
sometimes an adjective, as in ‘‘ You look well.” 
Likely, probably, like.—Likely is now used as an adjective only, ex- 
cept in the phrase ‘As likely as not;” the corresponding adverb is 
probably. We say, “ He is likely to come ;” “ He will probably come.” 
Like as an adjective means “similar,” as, ‘‘ Men of like excellence ;” 
“He looks like his grandfather ;” ‘‘ He was a man of like passions as 
we are.” In the sense of ‘in the same manner as” Jike is followed 
by a noun or a pronoun in the objective case, and is called by some 
an adverb, by others a preposition: as, ‘‘ He talks léke her.” 
Less, fewer, smaller.—Lcss refers to quantity, fewer to number, 
smaller to size. 
Most, almost.—Most denotes ‘‘the greatest number, quantity, or de- 
gree.” It is always superlative and never means “nearly,” which is 
the proper meaning of almost. We say, ‘‘Most of the boys are here; 
the time has almost come.” 
Near, nearly.—Near is an adjective; the corresponding adverb is 
nearly. 
Plenty is now in good use as a noun only, as ‘‘ Plenty of corn and

as plenty as blackberries,” but this use is obsolete. The use of 
plenty as an adverb, as ‘‘ The food is plenty good enough,” is a vul- 
garism. 
Some, somewhat, something.—Some is an adjective, us, ‘“‘ Some wa- 
ter; “Some brighter clime.” Somewhat is an adverb, as, ‘‘He is 
somewhat better.” ‘‘ Somewhat” is occasionally used as a noun, as, 
‘Somewhat of doubt remains,” but in this sense something is more 
common, 
This, these; that, those.—7Z/iis (plural these) and that (plural those) 
are the only adjectives in English that have distinct forms for the 
plural, A common mistake is to use the plural forms with singular 
collective nouns, as ‘‘ kind,” ‘ class,” “sort.” 
First, second, secondly, ctc.—First is both adjective and adverb. 
Second, third, etc., are adjectives only; the corresponding adverbs 
are secondly, thirdly, etc. Firstly is a vulgarism.

Adjective or Adverb.’—TIlliterate persons often forget 
that adjectives go with nouns and pronouns, but adverbs 
with verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Even cultivated per- 
sons are sometimes in doubt whether to use an-adjective or 
an adverb after certain verbs, as “ grow,” “look,” “sound,” 
“smell,” “taste.” If the added word applies to the sub- 
ject of the verb, it should be an adjective; if to the verb, 
it should be an adverb. We say “ We feel warm,” when 
we mean that we are warm; we say “ We feel warmly on 
this subject,” when we mean that our feeling is warm. 
“As arule, it is proper to use an adjective whenever some 
form of the verb ‘to be’ or ‘to seem’ may be substituted 
for the verb, an adverb when no such substitution can be 
made.” * Thus, “He looked angry; he spoke angrily.” 
Sometimes we may use either adjective or adverb with no 
difference in meaning : as, “‘ We were sitting guéet (quietly) 
round the fire.” 
Regarding the form of adverbs, ill-taught pupils often 
suppose that all words ending in “-ly” are adverbs, and 
1 “Foundations,” pp. 120-123. 2 Tbid., p. 121.
-P-A-G-E-120
  114 PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISH 
that all adverbs end in “-ly.” A glance at the italicized 
words in the following expressions will remove this delu- 
sion : “Come here;” “very pretty;” “he then rose ;” “lay it 
lengthwise,” “he fell backward,” “run fast,” “now it is 
done;” “a friendly Indian ; 9 66 a buzzing fly.” Though no 
comprehensive rule can be given for the form of adverbs, 
which must be learned for the most part by observation, 
it may be helpful to know that most “adjectives of qual- 
ity,” like gentle, true, take the suffix “-ly ” to make a corre- 
sponding adverb; and that the comparative and superla- 
tive degrees of adverbs ending in “-ly” usually prefix 
more and most.

too, and very—words which, as they express degree, prop- 
erly qualify adjectives or adverbs, and not verbs or parti-

under “Misused Nouns.” An amusing illustration of mis-

introduced his second wife to a friend as “ My date wife.” 
I. 
Agegravating, irritating.—In good use aggravating means ‘‘ making 
heavier, more grave, worse in some way.” It is often misused for 
trritating, exasperating, or provoking. 
All, the whole.—See page 120. 
Apt, likely, liable.— Apt implies a natural predisposition, an ha- 
bitual tendency. ‘“‘ Likely implies a probability of whatever charac- 
ter; léable, an unpleasant probability,”? One is apt to speak quick- 
ly, likely to hear good news, “able to be hurt. 
Both, each, every.—Both, meaning ‘‘the two, and not merely one 
of them,” groups objects, as, ‘‘ Both were men of hot temper.” 
Each means ‘‘all of any number, considered one by one,” as, ‘“‘ Zach 
boy recited in his turn.” very means ‘‘all of any number, consid- 
ered as composing a group or class,” as, ‘‘ Hvery pupil should have 
a dictionary and use it freely.” ‘‘ Hvery directs attention chiefly to 
the totality, each chiefly to the individuals composing it. It may 
also be observed that each usually refers to a numerically definite 
group. ... Thus, ‘Each theory is open to objection’ relates to an 
understood enumeration of theories, but ‘Every theory is open to 
objection’ refers to all theories that may exist.”* 
Many, much.—Many refers to number, much to quantity. 
Mutual, common.—Mutual properly means ‘‘reciprocal,” ‘‘inter- 
changed.” It is often misused for common in the sense of ‘‘belong- 
ing equally to both or all,” especially in the phrase, “A mutual 
friend.” 
Partly, partially.—‘‘ Partly, in the sense of ‘in part,’ is preferable 
to partially, since partially also means ‘ with partiality.’” * 
Quite, very.—Quite properly means ‘‘entirely”; in the sense of 
“very” or ‘‘to a considerable degree” it is not in good use. 
So-as, as-as.—Both so and as are us¢d as adverbs of degree correla- 
tive with the conjunction ‘‘as”: unless there is a negative in the

Il. 
Apparently, evidently, manifestly.—‘‘Apparently is properly used of 
that which seems, but may not be, real; evédently, of that which both 
seems and is real.” ! Manifestly is stronger than evidently. 
Average, ordinary.—Average implies an arithmetical computation ; 
if four persons lose respectively $10, $20, $30, and $40, the average 
loss is $25. The word is used figuratively by Dr. O. W. Holmes in 
“The average intellect of five hundred persons, taken as they come, 
is not very high.” In the sense of ‘‘usual,” ‘‘common in occur- 
rence,” ‘‘of the usual standard,” ordinary is preferable to average. 
Bound, determined.—Bownd properly means ‘‘ obliged,” ‘‘ fated,” 
or ‘funder necessity”: as, ‘‘A man is bound by his word;” “We 
hold ourselves in gratitude Jownd to receive . . . all such persons.” 
In the sense of ‘‘determined” bound is not in good use. in the 
sense of ‘‘sure” it is in colloquial, but not in literary, use. 
Continual, continuous.—‘‘ Continual is used of frequently repeated 
acts, as, ‘Continual dropping wears away a stone; continuous, of 
uninterrupted action, as, ‘the continuous flowing of a river.’”’? 
Deadly, deathly.—‘‘ Deathly, in the sense of ‘resembling death,’ as, 
‘She was deathly pale,’ is preferable to deadly, since deadly also 
means ‘inflicting death.’ ” * 
Decided, decisive.—‘‘ A decided opinion is a strong opinion, which 
perhaps decides nothing; a decisive opinion settles the question at 
issue. A lawyer may have decided views on a case; the judgment 
of a court is decisive.” * 
Dumb, stupid.—Dumb properly means ‘‘ mute,” ‘‘silent.” Its mis- 
use for stupid is partly due, especially in Pennsylvania, to its resem- 
blance to the German dumm. 
Existing, extant.—That is extant which has escaped the ravages of 
time (used chiefly of books, manuscripts, etc.); that is existing which 
has existence. 
Funny, odd.—/unny means ‘‘comical ;” in the sense of ‘strange ” 
or ‘‘odd” it is not in good use. 
Healthy, healthful, wholesome.—That is healthy which is in good

OF ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS 128 
health; that is healthful or wholesome which produces health. Whole- 
some commonly applies to food. 
Human, humane.—Human denotes what pertains to man as man; 
as, ‘human nature,” ‘‘hwman sacrifices.” Humane means ‘com- 
passionate.” 
Latest, last.—Latest, like the word ‘‘late,” contains a distinct refer- 
ence to time ; that is Ja¢est which comes after all others in time: as, 
“The latest news ;” ‘‘ The latest fashion.” Last, which was original- 
ly a contraction of ‘‘latest,” is now used without any distinct refer- 
ence to time, and denotes that which comes after all others in space 
or in a series: as, ‘‘ The dast house on the street ;” ‘‘ The Last of the 
Mohicans.” 
Lengthy, long-—Lengthy is said to have originated in the United 
States, but the earliest quotations found are from British authors. 
In the introduction to the second series of The Biglow Papers, Mr. 
Lowell wrote: ‘“‘ We have given back to England the excellent ad- 
jective lengthy . . . thus enabling their journalists to characterize 
our President’s messages by a word civilly compromising between 
long and tedious, so as not to endanger the peace of the two coun- 
tries by wounding our national sensitiveness to British criticism.” 
Lengthy is used chiefly of discourses or writings, and implies tedious- 
ness. Jong is used of anything that has length. 
Mad, angry.—M/ad means ‘‘insane ;” in the sense of ‘‘angry” it is 
not in good use. 
New, novel.—That is new which is not old; that is novel which is 
both new and strange. \ 
Oral, verbal.—‘‘ Oral, in the sense of ‘in spoken words,’ is prefer- 
able to verbal, since verbal means ‘in words’ whether spoken or writ- 
ten.”)! | 
Pitiable, pitiful.—‘‘ Pitiadie, in the sense of ‘deserving pity,’ is pref- 
erable to pitiful, since pitiful also means ‘compassionate,’ as, ‘The 
Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.’”! | 
Practicable, practical.—That is practicable which can be done ; that 
is practical which is not theoretical only: as, ‘‘a practicable plan,” 
“a practical electrician.” | 
Prominent, eminent.—Prominent means ‘‘ conspicuous,” ‘standing 
out so as to be easily seen;” eminent means “distinguished in char- 
aeter er rank.”

  124 PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ENGLISH 
Real, really, very.—Real is properly an adjective, meaning ‘‘ not im- 
aginary or counterfeit,” as, ‘‘7eal diamonds.” Its misuse for the 
adverbs really and very, as, ‘‘ This is real pretty,” is a vulgarism. 
Seared, afraid.—The participle scared means “‘ frightened ;” afraid 
is an adjective meaning ‘“‘in fear.” Before ‘‘of,” the proper word 
is afraid: as, ‘‘ She is afraéd of horses.” Scared of is not in good 
use, 
Grand, gorgeous, awful, splendid, elegant, lovely, magnificent. — 
Grand properly implies “ grandeur ;” gorgeous, ‘‘ splendid colors ;” 
auful, ‘“awe;” elegant, ‘elegance ;” splendid, ‘splendor ;” lovely, 
“surpassing loveliness ;’ magnificent, ‘‘ magnificence.” 
‘“We talk, sometimes, with people whose conversation would lead 
you to suppose that they had lived in a museum, where all the ob- 
jects were monsters and extremes. . . . They use the superlative of 
grammar: ‘most perfect,’ ‘most exquisite,’ ‘most horrible.’ Like 
the French, they are enchanted, they are desolate, because you have 
got or have not got a shoestring or a wafer you happen to want—not 
perceiving that superlatives are diminutives and weaken. .. . All 
this comes of poverty. We are unskilful definers. From want of 
skill to convey quality, we hope to move admiration by quantity. 
Language should aim to describe the fact... . ’Tis very wearisome, 
this straining talk, these experiences all exquisite, intense, and tre- 
mendous.”!

‘Use of the Comparative and Superlative.—The compara- 
tive degree is preferable when two things or sets of things 
are compared, the superlative when three or more are com- 
pared, 
To say “Tron is more useful than any metal” is clearly 
incorrect, because iron is included in “any metal,” and of 
course iron is not more useful than itself. We must in 
thought set iron off in a class by itself, which we can do 
by inserting “other” after “any.” “Iron is more useful 
than any other metal” is correct. After comparatives ac- 
companied by “than,” the words “any” and “all” should 
be followed by “ other.” 
To say “Iron is the most useful of any (or, any other) 
metal” is also clearly incorrect, because we mean that 
iron is the most useful, not of “one metal (no matter 
which) ” or of ‘some metals (no matter which),” but of all 
metals. We should therefore omit the word “any,” say- 
ing simply “Iron is the most useful of (all) metals.” It 
is also incorrect to say “Tron is the most useful of all 
other metals,” for iron is not one of the “other metals.” 
Beware of using “any” or “other” with superlatives fol- 
lowed by “ of.”

CHAPTER VII. 
OF PREPOSITIONS 
Misused Prepositions.'—A writer, in choosing the proper 
preposition to express his meaning, must rely chiefly on his 
sense of idiom, that is, his knowledge of English usage, 
but he may find the following notes helpful. 
Among, between.—‘‘ Among is the proper word when the reference 
is to more than two persons or things, or groups of persons or things; 
between, when the reference is to two only.” ? 
At, in.—Before names of places to denote ‘‘ where,” at is used when 
the place is so small as to be treated asa mere point, or when, al- 
though large, it is viewed as a mere point; im is used when it is de- 
sired to make prominent the idea ‘within the bounds of :” as, ‘‘He 
arrived at Liverpool in the morning and remained én that city two 
days.” Before the name of the place in which the speaker dwells, 
if the place is of any size, in is generally preferred to aé, unless the 
place is so remote that it dwindles in the mental vision to a point. 
Back of.—Back of, though frequently heard in conversation and 
sometimes seen in print, is not in good use. 
Beside, besides.—Beside means “‘ by the side of ;” besides is now used 
only in the sense of ‘‘in addition to,” ‘‘other than;” as, ‘‘ Who sits 
beside you?” ‘‘ Who besides us knows this ?” 
By, with.—To introduce the agent of an action dy is now commonly 
used; the material instrument or tool is usually introduced by with: 
as, ‘‘Duncan was murdered by Macbeth with a dagger.” 
Different from, different to.—Different from is preferable to difer- 
ent to and different than, ‘ 
In, into.—‘‘ Jn implies presence inside of, or within; ¢nto implies 
movement to the inside of. Before a man can move ¢n a room, he 
must already have moved into it.” *

In, on.—Before names of streets, in implies some reference to sur- 
roundings; on is less definite, indicating location only. 
On to, onto,—‘‘ Good use does not support either on to or onto.” + 
Wait for, wait on—Zo wait for means ‘‘to await,” as, ‘We will 
wait for you at the corner.” To wait on means “‘to attend on,” as, 
“At dinner the women waited on the men,”

OF CONJUNCTIONS 
Vulgarisms.'—Every educated person is expected to 
know the correct use of the following words :— 
Like, as.—In good use like is never a conjunction, and therefore it 
cannot be used instead of as to introduce a clause. It is incorrect to 
say, ‘‘ Walk like I walk;” but one may say, ‘‘ He walks like me,” or 
“He looks léke his grandfather.” ? 
Except, without, unless.—Hxcept, which was originally a past-parti- 
ciple, was once in good use as a conjunction; but in modern use it 
has been displaced as a conjunction by wnless, and is now a preposi- 
tion only. We may say, ‘‘ All went eacept me,” but we may not say, 
“‘ Except you go with me, I will stay at home.” Another word not 
in good use as a conjunction, but often heard instead of ‘‘ unless,” is 
without.

Misused Conjunctions.’—Conjunctions are few in number 
and are more tefiiite in their meanings than prepositions. 
Most errors in using them spring from confused thinking 
or hasty writing. “A close reasoner and a good writer in 
general may be known by his pertinent use of connec- 
tives.” ? 
And.—And has, generally speaking, the meaning of ‘‘in addition 
to.” 
But.—But implies some exception, opposition, or contrast. Equiv. 
alent, or nearly equivalent, expressions are ‘‘ however,” ‘‘on the 
other hand,” ‘‘ yet,” ‘‘ nevertheless.” 
As.—‘‘As has so many meanings that it is better, when possible, to 
use a conjunction that covers less ground.” * 
Because, for, since.—The difference between these words is chiefly 
a difference in emphasis. ‘‘ We will not go, decause it is raining” is 
the strongest way of expressing the relation of cause and effect. In 
“Since it is raining, we will not go,” the emphasis is shifted from

the cause to the effect, which becomes the prominent idea. In ‘‘ We 
will not go, for it is raining,” the reason, “‘it is raining,” is an- 
nounced as itself a bit of news. Often the choice between these 
words is decided by the ear. 
How.—How properly means ‘‘in what manner” or ‘‘to what ex- 
tent.” It is often misused for ‘‘ that” to introduce an object clause. 
Nor, or.—Wor is the correlative of neither, sometimes of other nega- 
tives. Or is the correlative of ether. 
Therefore, so.—In the sense of ‘‘for this reason,” therefore is pref- 
erable to so, since so has other meanings. 
Though.—Though means “ notwithstanding,” ‘‘in spite of the fact 
that.” 
As if, as though.—‘‘As 7f is, on the whole, preferable to as though.””! 
When, while—When means ‘‘at the time that ;” while, ‘during the 
time that,” ‘‘as long as.” ‘‘ When fixes attention on a date or period ; 
while fixes attention on the lapse of time.” ?

Omitted Conjunctions.—Careless writers sometimes omit 
conjunctions that are necessary either to the grammar or 
to the sense. A common form of this fault is illustrated 
in “This is as good if not better than that ”—a sentence in 
which “as” is omitted after “as good.” The best way to 
correct the sentence is to recast it, thus: “ This is as good 
as that, if not better.”

4 common form of this fault is the use in certain cases of 
“and” or “but” before the words “who,” “which,” 
“when,” or “where,” which are themselves connectives: 
as, “The challenge was accepted by Orlando, a young man 
little known up to that time, but to whom Rosalind had 
taken a great liking.” If the relative clause introduced 
by “who,” “which,” “when,” or “ where” is to be joined 
to a preceding relative clause, the conjunction is proper: 
as, “The challenge was accepted by Orlando, a young man 
who was little known at that time, dwt to whom Rosalind 
had taken a great liking.”

11. He spoke in a deep and low tone, but which nevertheless was

Misplaced Correlatives.—When conjunctions are used as 
correlatives, as “‘ both-and,” “ either-or,” each of the corre- 
lated words should be so placed as to indicate clearly what 
ideas are to be connected in thought. This principle is 
violated in “He not only visited Paris, but Berlin also.” 
In this sentence the position of ‘not only” before the verb 
“visited ” leads one to expect some corresponding verb in 
the second part of the sentence; in fact, however, the two 
connected words are “ Paris” and “ Berlin ;” “ visited ” ap- 
plies to both. This meaning is clearly indicated by put- 
ting “not only” before “ Paris:” thus, “He visited not 
only Paris, but Berlin also.” As a rule the word after the 
first correlative should be the same part of speech as the 
word after the second correlative.

  APPENDIX 
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS 
Tue following suggestions are made in answer to many in- 
quiries from teachers who perceive the rare excellence of the 
“Foundations of Rhetoric,” but who do not clearly see, be- 
cause of the novel method of the book, how to turn its merits 
to account in their class-rooms. The suggestions outline one 
way in which the book has been used to great advantage. 
It should never be forgotten that the illustrative sentences 
in the “ Foundations” have no value except as they help the 
student to grasp a principle that he can apply in his own use 
of language. In every case the emphasis should be laid on the 
principle which is announced or illustrated. Merely learning 
the corrected sentences by heart is useless and should not be 
permitted. 
In taking a class over Parr I., which treats of words, it is 
the writer’s practice to assign a short lesson—from one to 
three pages —in connection with every recitation in English. 
The leading ideas and most typical sentences in each lesson 
are privately marked in the teacher’s book with colored pencil, 
so that they may readily catch his eye, and from five to twelve 
minutes of each recitation period are taken up with a rapid 
questioning on these leading ideas and typical sentences. 
Corrections or answers unaccompanied by reasons are not ac- 
cepted. Attention is always fixed, not on the form of the 
illustrative sentence, but on the principle of usage under dis- 
cussion, Pupils would rather commit to memory the sen-
-P-A-G-E-158
eS a EE Tee ep ME Tt ey eee 
152 APPENDIX 
tences than trouble themselves about reasons; but they will 
master reasons when they find they must. After principles 
have been mastered, exercises in the choice of forms and 
words are needed in order that knowledge may be converted 
into habit. 
In Parts II. and III. the lessons are equally short and the 
emphasis is unceasingly laid on the question “ Why?” If the 
subject is difficult, it is desirable, at the time that the lesson 
is assigned, to lead the class over the text and some of the 
illustrative sentences in order to open, as it were, the eyes of 
the pupils. Since these parts of the book treat not of single 
words, but of sentences and paragraphs, recitations on them 
seem to call for the use of pencil or chalk. One successful 
teacher conducts the recitation with books open, requiring 
her pupils to cover the correct sentences with a strip of paper 
while they explain and correct the faults in the incorrect sen- 
tences. The writer’s practice is to paste the faulty sentences 
on cards of convenient size and thickness—the arrangement 
of columns is such that the sentences can all be cut from one 
old book—and to distribute them among eight or ten pupils at 
the beginning of the recitation hour. While other matters are 
being attended to, these pupils write the sentences in correct 
form on the blackboard, and, when the time comes, give their 
reasons for the changes which they have made. Their work 
is discussed, if necessary, by the whole class, Reviews and 
written tests should be frequent. As fast as the various prin- 
ciples explained and illustrated in Parrs IL. and HI. are stud- 
ied, the attention of pupils should be immediately turned to 
their own writing. It will be far more profitable for them to 
correct their own offences against clearness, force, ease, and 
unity than to correct similar offences committed by others. 
For this reason the Practicat Exercises in Eneuisn contains 
no exercises on the subjects discussed in Parrs II. and IIL. 
of the “ Foundations.”

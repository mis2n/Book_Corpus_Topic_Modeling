PREFACE 
In the course of studies in relation to Aesthetics, under- 
taken many years ago, I was led to make a special study 
of the psychology of pleasure and pain, the results of 
which were published in the volume entitled Pain, Pleasure 
and Aesthetics. In that work there was presented for 
examination a theory of Algedonics which seemed more 
adequate to account for our pleasure-pain experiences than 
any I had met with in the published works of other 
students of the subject, and which appeared to avoid the 
difficulties that had heretofore availed to discredit the 
hedonic theory of Aesthetics. 
Before I was willing to present this theory for examina- 
tion and criticism, I had satisfied myself that it could be 
related with much completeness to other psychic fields 
than those directly considered, and had sketched in out- 
line a restatement of psychological doctrine which seemed 
to bring all related psychic facts into harmony with the 
theory I defended. It was necessary however, in the book 
mentioned, to refrain from any but the briefest reference 
to this general restatement, not only because it seemed 
best to avoid discussions not distinctly essential to the 
argument of the book, but principally because an attempt 
to place this restatement before the reader would have 
involved the writing of a treatise on general psychology 
in which the discussion of Algedonics could have appeared

only as a special division, and such a treatise I had small 
hopes of being able to write. 
This sketch of a systematic Psychology was completed 
in July, 1891, and corresponds in its main lines with 
the matter presented in the Second Book of this work. 
During the intervening years I have endeavored, in all my 
psychological studies, to test the validity of the general 
scheme then outlined; and having found that my con- 
ceptions of mental life have been materially clarified by 
its use, it has seemed worth while to put it in such 
shape that any value it may have may be tested by other 
workers in the same field. 
Book III. in which I treat of the nature of the Self 
has been developed in connection with this attempt to 
make a systematic analysis of our mental states: but the 
thesis as to the nature of the Self, although developed 
later, has become an important component part of the 
whole as here presented. 
In a work which aims to cover ground that has been 
the subject of thought of many masters, the reader will 
not be surprised to find much that is far from new ; but 
he will pardon this when he notes that my aim is to pre- 
sent for his consideration not so much an array of newly 
discovered facts, but rather a special manner of viewing 
Consciousness as a whole, by which, it appears to me, we 
are enabled to treat the problems of Psychology in a 
more scientific and orderly manner than is possible from 
the points of view usually taken. 
In what I have said above I have spoken of this work 
as an essay in Psychology. But I shall be prepared to 
find some trained metaphysician who may read the opening 
sections of the first chapter proclaiming that I, at the very 
start, make assumptions which necessarily involve meta- 
physical considerations, and that I write as though I had 
never heard of Berkeley or Fichte, not to mention Locke,
-P-A-G-E-7
  PREFACE ix 
Hume, Kant, and a host of others who have dealt with 
the problems connected with these assumptions. 
I am not concerned to quarrel with one who would 
honor me by calling me a metaphysician in disguise: but 
I may say that while I of course consider the metaphysical 
problems to be of the very highest importance, I look upon 
them as problems which deal with complex conceptual 
systems ; which conceptual systems are emphatic parts of 
my consciousness when I turn to their consideration. It 
seems to me evident that one is unable to deal properly 
with the problems involved with, or hovering about, these 
metaphysical conceptual systems, without first considering 
the general nature of consciousness in which these concep- 
tual systems appear. Yet it seems equally clear that many 
highly acute philosophers have attacked these problems 
without adequate study of this more general question, 
and that they have often thus been led into error. 
It is my aim to enquire into the nature of this con- 
sciousness in which these metaphysical conceptual systems 
appear. And although I agree that such an enquiry must 
bring forward considerations which will have their influence 
upon the statement, and possible solution, of these meta- 
physiczl problems ; still I hold it to be proper to aim to 
waive these problems in the effort to gain a clearer insight 
into the nature of consciousness, as part of which they 
appear. 
The debt I owe to other writers will be clear to every 
trained reader, and so far as possible I have endeavored to 
acknowledge this indebtedness. It is impossible, however, 
in these days of widespread activity in the investigation of 
psychological subjects, not to assimilate unconsciously the 
thought of one’s contemporaries, and of those who have 
left their works to us as a common heritage. I can do 
no more than hope that I have not failed to express my 
appreciation of the thought of others in all matters of 
ety

importance, and that I have done no injustice to others 
working in the same field whose writings I have missed or 
overlooked. I cannot but make my special acknowledgments 
however to Prof. Wm. James, whose works have been 
a constant source of inspiration to me even where I find 
myself in disagreement with him ; and to Dr. G. F. Stout, 
by whose emphasis of the importance of considering con- 
sciousness as a system the reader will discover my thought 
has been very materially influenced, although it will be 
equally clear that I have departed in many respects from 
his conceptions and methods.

CONSCIOUSNESS 
CHAPTER I 
THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS 
I 
Sec. 1. One of the most serious difficulties met by the 
careful student in any field is found in the unfortunate 
manner in which we are wont, in common speech, to employ 
a single word to refer to two or more meanings which in 
the course of the growth of language have become quite 
diverse. Such is the case with the word consciousness) 
which I use as the title of this book: a word which I 
would gladly displace could I find another equally convenient 
and equally well understood. 
Although this word has been employed in many different 
ways,! two very distinctive usages are commonly met with. 
' According to the first of these usages, which is the one 
1 Confer Appendix to Bain’s Emotions and Will, Of late it has even been 
suggested that the use of the word be abandoned because of objectionable 
metaphysical connotations attached to it by certain authors. Confer William 
James and Frederick J. E. Woodbridge, Journal of Philosophy, etc., i. 18, 
and ii. 5. a

-P-A-G-E-16
  2 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
adopted in this work, the word consciousness refers to 
psychic existence as such; as, for instance, one speaks of 
the hypothetical consciousness of the plants. But one is 
likely also to hear someone say, ‘‘ you will not be conscious 
of the heat if you play a game of tennis with me,” and here 
the word is made to refer to states of “‘awareness”’ as opposed . 
to mere “sentience.” Evidently consciousness as a mere 
psychic existent does not necessarily imply awareness, which 
is a special reflective type of psychic existence, and | there- 
fore prefer to use the word in the broader sense, especially 
as the words unconsciousness and unconscious are employed 
almost invariably by the plain man, and the scientific writer 
as well, to refer to psychic-non-existence. Maudsley thus 
spoke of “unconscious cerebration” in referring to brain 
activities, to which under his view no psychic existences 
correspond: and thus the average man speaks of the 
unconsciousness of coma and of deep sleep, implying that 
they are states in connection with which nothing psychic 
exists. ; 
Sec. 2. If we employ the word consciousness in this 
broad way it may be said that at any moment, so far as I 
am concerned, the “now” of consciousness is all that exists, 
whether of me or of the universe for me. It is true that 
some phases of consciousness as grasped in reflection appear 
to involve more than my consciousness, appear to tell also of 
an objective world which is not of my consciousness, and 
which is not dependent upon the existence of my conscious- 
ness for its existence. But even so it is clear that if I 
conceive my consciousness annihilated I must conceive 
myself to be at that moment non-existent, and must agree 
1] imagine that when Prof. James speaks of “ pure experience” he refers 
to what I would here apply the word consciousness. But the word 
experience seems to me to be objectionable in that it connotes a somewhat 
that experiences, and thus may be taken to refer to what is really merely a 
certain phase of consciousness considered as 4 psychic existent.
-P-A-G-E-17
THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS 3 
that my perceptions and conceptions, without which there 
would be for me no universe of objects, would likewise 
disappear and be for me at that moment non-existent. The 
very appearance of the existence of this objective world as 
apart from me is determined by certain characteristics of 
these very perceptions and conceptions themselves, character- 
istics which are summed up in my statement of a belief in 
the reality of the objects to which these perceptions and 
conceptions refer ; but this belief, this conviction, is certainly 
a mental phase belonging entirely to my consciousness, and 
which would become non-existent were my consciousness 
annihilated. 
It is true that in my daily life I for the most part consider 
little else than those parts of my consciousness which I 
describe as objective realities; that among these objects I 
note human bodies, among which one, which I call my own, 
has the special characteristic that it is very definitely related 
to that part of my consciousness which I distinguish from 
objects in the outer world. It is true also that I attribute to 
these other human bodies conscious experiences correspond- 
ing with my own ; and that it would be impossible for me 
to gain the orderly conceptions of my own consciousness 
with which I am familiar without comparing the notion I 
have of my own personality with the notion I have of the 
personalities of other men, and of the existence in the 
universe of other living beings and inanimate objects which 
affect me. None the less does it appear that all this objec- 
tive universe, with its intensely interesting specific objects, 
would be all non-existent for me if my consciousness were 
annihilated. 
Il 
Sec. 3. When I study my consciousness I find it always 
displaying a doubleness of aspect. There is a something 
relatively clear“and distinct, which however does not seem
-P-A-G-E-18
4 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
to exhaust the consciousness of the moment, but appears to 
stand over against a something else of consciousness which 
is vague and elusive. This vague and elusive psychic 
“something else of consciousness”’ we call the Self, and the 
relatively clear and distinct somewhat is commonly now-a-days 
spoken of as the presentation to the Self. This presentative 
somewhat we may speak of as a psychic emphasis within 
consciousness, reserving for the moment any attempt to 
justify this use of the term. 
Some of those who employ the word presentation hold on 
metaphysical grounds that the presentation is given to a Self 
which is beyond consciousness. I would ask the reader to 
note that I look upon the Self* as part and parcel of the 
consciousness in which the presentations appear. 
Sec. 4. At times there seems to emerge, as it were, out 
of this vague and elusive “ something else of consciousness ” 
to which presentations are given, a somewhat more explicit 
with which these same presentations also appear to stand in 
contrast, and then we find ourselves assuming a special 
attitude which we describe as that of self-consciousness. 
We then experience not only that psychic emphasis (e.g. 
a bright light) which a moment ago appeared merely as a 
presentation within consciousness which it did not exhaust, 
but we experience this psychic emphasis as an object related 
to an ego (e.g. when I experience the fact that 7 am sensible 
of the bright sensation), both this object and the ego to 
which the object is related together standing contrasted still 
with a something else of consciousness. What was before 
a presentation to the Self retains this presentative charac- 
teristic, but has become bound up with an ego which also 
appears as part of a presentation to the Self. The dual 
whole,—the object and the ego itself,—is thus a complex 
psychic emphasis standing in contrast with the rest of 
11 refer here of course to the Self of the moment in which the pre- 
sentation is given, and not to the conceptual Self which we study later.
-P-A-G-E-19
    THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS 5 
consciousness, the dual whole appearing as a complex pre- 
sentation to the Self. 
That this analysis is justified is made clear by a further 
examination, which shows us that as at certain times we 
may have emphatic in experience the object (say the bright 
light) without the ego, so at other times we may have 
emphatic in experience the ego without what appears as its 
object. At this moment I find emphatic in consciousness 
what I call the ego in and for itself; but a moment ago 
I found in experience both this ego and some sensation, 
let us say, which appeared as its object. If this sensational 
emphasis had happened to be an intensely brilliant flash of 
light, my experience would have been of this sensation 
alone, without any experience of the ego with which it was 
contrasted. 
This object is often spoken of as the presentation to the 
ego, but to avoid confusion I shall limit the use of the 
word presentation to describe psychic emphases as these are 
contrasted with the Self. : 
Sec. 5. The “objects” of which we have just spoken 
are of many kinds and of very diverse types, and are them- 
selves usually so important that the ego to which they are 
given is implicit rather than explicit ; which is not surprising 
when we consider that at times these objects often appear as 
the wholes of presentations of the moments in which they are 
given. Objects as thus broadly grouped are commonly 
spoken of as “objects of attention.” 
Within this broad class of “ objects of attention”’ we find 
some which have a special characteristic which leads us to 
describe them as a particular kind of objects ; viz. ‘“ objects 
in the outer world.” Objects of this class are so important 
that they become separated away from other objects of 
attention, and we commonly look upon “objects in the 
outer world” as standing over against and separate from 
other objects, rather than as a special type of these objects.
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
These “objects in the outer world,” in their turn, are of 
many special kinds and types. One of these special types is 
the human body ; and still another, quite within the human 
body, is the ever active nervous system. 
Sec. 6. This analysis may perhaps be made clearer by 
reference to the following diagram :

Fic. 1. 
We discover that we naturally place our presentations 
(Class C) in two great groups, whether they appear as objects 
(Class E) or not. 
We find first our sensations, our emotions, pleasure and 
pain, our percepts, our images and ideas, and our more or 
less complex concepts, etc., all of which are commonly spoken 
of as subjective states ; and this because we have an indefinite 
appreciation of the fact that they bear a close relation to the 
Self, the basis of which notion we speak of later. 
Contrasted with these so-called subjective states we find 
certain complex systematized concepts which we describe as 
objective realities, and which appear to be in a certain sense 
independent of, and outside and beyond, these purely 
subjective states. One of these objective realities is the 
human body, within which exists an active nervous system. 
Sec. 7. Now we have discovered the very interesting fact 
that changes in the class of presentations G (activities of 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS 7 
nerve) are in some way implicated with changes in that part 
of consciousness which is within Class C (presentations), 
and often within Class E (objects), but not within Class F 
(objects in outer world). 
Let us suppose that a pin pricks my finger. In such a 
case I have in consciousness certain “objects in the outer 
world,” a pin and a finger, in certain relations. But I have 
more than this; for as the pin pricks my finger there is what 
we may call a streak or an eddy as it were on the surface of 
that part of the stream of consciousness which does not 
appear as among “objects in the outer world”: we may call 
it a pain, or a sensation, as we consider one or another of 
its characteristics. All that we have thus spoken of is of 
my consciousness, not only the “objects in the outer world” 
which are given in forms of perception, but the mass of non- 
outer-world experience, in which appears this “streak” of 
pain or sensation. 
The object-in-the-outer-world presentations thus distin- 
guished are given originally in perceptual experiences. But 
we gain later a new form of presentations of a conceptual 
nature, which we still describe as “objects in the outer world,” 
which however are not perceived, although we conceive of 
them as possible of perception if favourable conditions are 
given. Of such conceptual object-in-the-outer-world pre- 
sentations we have an example in what we describe as the 
activities of nerve. We conceive of such activities of nerve 
in our own bodies, but we have never, and can never, 
perceive them: in considering them we are dealing with 
presentations of a very complex conceptual type. The pin 
and the finger spoken of in the illustration above are per- 
ceptual outer world objects ; the action of nerve occasioned 
by the pin’s puncture of the skin is a complex conceptual 
outer-world object, one of whose connotations is the possi- 
bility of its perception under favourable conditions. The 
change in this action of nerve is also a change of this special
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
outer-world conceptual object which is conceived of as 
having perceptual potentiality, and this change is judged 
to correspond with the change in the non-object-in-the- 
outer-world presentation which we call the pricking pain. 
Changes in this activity of nerve thus seem to correspond 
with changes in the form of consciousness which we speak 
of as purely internal, or subjective ; and this correspondence 
has been observed in so wide an array of cases that neurolo- 
‘gists and psychologists in general have come to the conclusion 
that in all probability all changes in conscious life correspond 
with changes in this activity of nerve ;—even the very con- 
ception of “action of nerve” itself corresponding with a 
conceptual action of nerve not at the moment presented 
in consciousness. This from our present point of view is 
the hypothesis of neururgic and noetic’ correspondence to 
which we refer often below. 
Sec. 8. The natural man does not distinguish between 
the objective (Class E) and the subjective (Class C apart 
from Class E), as any one who questions him may easily 
discover ; and this leads us to surmise that in the beginning 
1] have adopted this word “neururgic,” meaning “relating to the activity 
of nerve,” because there seems to be no word in current use which has this 
specific meaning, and which is free from disturbing connotations. I first 
used it in an article published in Mind for October 1902. Dr. Maudsley 
(Mind, 48) used the words “ neurotic pattern,” and William Cyples in his 
Process of Human Experience used the phrase “neurotic diagram” in somewhat 
the same sense in which I use later on the phrase “neururgic pattern.” 
The word zcetic has been used by Hamilton “ to express those cognitions 
which originate in the mind itself,” in contradistinction to those determined 
by impressions from without; and in this use of the term he has been 
followed by other writers. Dr. Stout in his Analytic Psychohgy distinguishes 
between “noetic” and “anoetic” mental states, but he acknowledges (vol. i. 
p- 171) “that the antithesis of active and passive states of mind is not 
absolute; instead of a well-marked transition from the presence of activity 
to its complete absence, we find a series of insensible gradations.” As I 
hold that there is no difference of kind in mental activity in the direction 
indicated there seems to be ample justification for my use of the word 
“noetic” in this connection, in consideration of its convenience.
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS 9 
of man’s growth in intelligence he failed altogether to make 
the distinction between the two, this view being strengthened 
when we consider his uncritical animistic conceptions." 
But objective presentations, as we shall see later, must 
always as a class be more emphatic and striking than subjec- 
tive presentations, and hence we find all men displaying a 
deeply ingrained habit which leads them to consider all of 
their experiences objectively. The learned psychologist 
displays this tendency as much as does the plain man, and © 
if we take this fact into consideration it becomes apparent 
that when one or the other notes that a relation exists 
between that subjective presentation which he calls his mind, 
and that objective presentation which he calls his body, he 
habitually considers his mind quite objectively as though it 
were the mind of another man. He has in consciousness 
the objectively real world apart from the man M; and he 
has the objectively real nervous system of the man M which 
is affected by the energies within its objective environment ; 
and he has also the objectively real consciousness belonging 
to the man M, the existence of which he assumes as the _ 
result of his own experience as related with his observation 
of other men. He may indeed be thinking of himself as 
the man we have called M ; but even so the relation as thus 
considered is altogether a relation between objects. 
The fact that he thus considers the mental changes related 
to neryous changes in an objective way is often overlooked 
by the psychologist, because he so constantly refers to his 
own experienced conscious changes in order that he may 
know what forms of consciousness to attribute to the mind 
of the man M as objectively viewed. 
1As Santayana has lately suggested the ascription of minds to all outer- 
world objects was natural to the man who failed to distinguish with clear- 
ness the objective from the subjective, but who had begun to appreciate the 
distinction, and had found himself forced to attribute to his fellow-man a 
mind similar to his own.
-P-A-G-E-24
10 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
  The psychologist is entirely warranted in adopting this 
objective attitude, which indeed all scientific investigators 
adopt in their work, provided he does not overlook the fact 
that there is an entirely different mode of considering this 
relation between mind and body which, following common 
usage, we may call the thoroughgoing subjective view, which 
is in a sense more fundamental and more significant than the 
objective view, and according to which, as we have seen, 
the outer world, and the objects within it, are complex 
systematized concepts which are within and part of con- 
sciousness. It is not easy to keep this distinction of stand- 
points clear, and therefore not surprising that we find 
ourselves shifting from one to the other, and often to our 
great discomfiture.? 
In as much as I shall deal with this relation of mind and 
body from the objective standpoint in much that follows, 
and in order to avoid unusual forms of statement shall use 
the objective terminology where I refer to the relation in 
my consideration from the subjective point of view, it has 
seemed well here to state briefly the relation of mind to 
body in non-objective terms. 
1 It seems clear for instance that if we maintain the objective view we are 
unable to entertain the suggestion of the idealistic ontologist that esse is 
percepi. For as objectively viewed the existence of the object in this world 
is not dependent upon any such relation of the man’s body to this object as 
will necessarily involve the existence of a percept in his consciousness. ‘The 
man may close his eyes, and then in this objective view I still have in my 
experience the real existent object in the outer world ; and also the man’s 
nervous state now: unaffected by this object as it was when his eyes were 
open ; and also his assumed state of consciousness correspondingly altered. 
But the case is quite different if we consider the question altogether 
subjectively ; and it would seem that, if we are to deal ontologically with the 
relation of consciousness to the world which appears as apart from it, we 
must abandon the objective attitude altogether. For the problem set for 
himself by the ontologist is this : what is the meaning of the fact that our 
percepts have a reference to objective realities. Now he cannot “get into 
the skin” of his objectively viewed man to take cognizance of the evidences
-P-A-G-E-25
  
  THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS II 
displayed in such relationship as there exists: he is really dealing with a 
question of relations within his own consciousness as a whole, in which 
objective realities appear as systematized concepts. And in this subjective 
consideration he does not discover any opposition whatever to holding that 
esse is percepi. 
The difficulty usually found by the plain man in dealing with this 
problem is due to the fact that he thinks you are asking him to consider a 
problem relating to his objective experience. The difficulty the average 
philosophical student finds with this problem seems to be that he thinks of 
his percept in the subjective way and of his reality in an objective way. 
As we have seen above, if he clings to the subjective view he finds no 
difficulty in agreeing that esse is percepi. And if on the other hand he 
clings to the objective view this same position is easily maintained, but then 
it would be expressed by saying “‘ when my friend’s percept ceases to exist 
his experience of an object causing this percept ceases to exist also” ; this 
being the objective description of the same fact which when subjectively 
considered leads to the statement that esse is percepi.

  CHAPTER II 
OF NEURURGIC AND NOETIC CORRESPONDENCES 
I 
Sec. 1. Ler us now, frankly taking the objective stand- 
point, attempt to make clear the implications of the 
observation that certain changes in the body of a man 
correspond with certain changes in that man’s consciousness. 
The earliest of thinkers must have noted that the mind 
on the one hand appears at times to govern bodily activities; 
and that bodily conditions, on the other hand, appear at 
times to determine the nature of mental states ; and these 
observations must certainly have led to equally early 
questionings concerning the nature of the relation between 
man’s consciousness and his bodily states. Nevertheless, 
even in our day we find the majority of intelligent men 
content to look upon this relation as a more or less 
haphazard and lawless one. They rest satisfied with the 
notion that the mind acts upon the body only occasionally ; 
and that the activity of the body, or of the nervous system 
within it, only occasionally involves consciousness. 
In these days we trace back the source of these bodily 
activities to the activities of the nervous system, and have 
generally accepted the view that some sort of correspon- 
dence exists between neural and psychic changes. The keen 
study of the structure and functioning of the brain has 
brought forward a great accumulation of evidence of this
-P-A-G-E-27
NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 13 
correspondence, and has led to the assumption, to use 
familiar terms, that there can be no “psychosis without a 
corresponding neurosis,”—or as this is usually understood, 
that no change can occur in a man’s consciousness unless a 
corresponding change occurs in the brain part of his nervous 
system. 
This hypothesis is accepted by the great body of scientific 
men of our time, although it must be acknowledged that 
but a relatively small number of “ psychoses” have been 
connected with recognized “neuroses”; and that the best 
that can be said in support of this view is that each advance 
in the study of the activities of the brain has added to the 
evidence which supports the hypothesis. 
Sec. 2. Any investigator in whom logical tendencies are 
developed, and who has reached the conclusion above 
spoken of, can scarcely fail to note that the theory thus 
developed is one-sided, and must find himself asking 
whether it may also be held that there can be no “ neurosis 
without a corresponding psychosis.”1 It appears, however, 
so evident to the average student that there are many brain 
activities which are not accompanied by alterations in con- 
sciousness that little attempt has been made to study this 
special question ; psychologists and neurologists alike have 
been content to hold that mental activity is only occasionally 
coincident with neural change. 
Psychological research in late years, however, has brought 
forward much evidence to show that in many cases where 
neural action had not been supposed to have a mental 
correspondent, such correspondent does really exist, but is 
obscured, and unnoticed, or quickly forgotten. This has 
1 George Henry Lewes in his Physical Basis of Mind has set forth many 
arguments in favour of the view that all neural activities have their psychic 
coincidents. In the opinion of the writer the general conclusions thus 
presented by Mr. Lewes and others have not received the serious attention 
they deserve from either psychologists or physiologists.  
-P-A-G-E-28
14 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
led to the assumption that there exist what are spoken of 
quite improperly as unconscious mental activities ; and later 
to the assumption that there are what are little less unfor- 
tunately called “‘sub-conscious” mental states ; and these are 
conceived of as correspondent with certain neural activities 
which had been thought to bear no relation to consciousness. 
Nevertheless the investigator still makes note of many 
nervous activities which do not appear to be in any way 
connected with what we usually think of as our mental life. 
But in considering the evidence before us, it is especially 
worth while to bear in mind the two meanings that are 
attached to the word consciousness, of which we have spoken 
in the opening section of Chapter 1. For when we enquire 
whether all neururgic changes have correspondent with them 
changes in consciousness, we use the word consciousness as 
the equivalent of psychic existence. But when, in opposition 
to such a view, we say that many known neururgic changes 
occur without any changes in consciousness, we use the word 
consciousness as the equivalent of awareness. The evidence 
adduced is therefore utterly inconclusive: for, as psychic 
existence may well be, and doubtless is, broader than 
awareness, it may be that the neururgic changes under 
consideration do involve psychic changes but of a type of 
which we cannot become aware. 
In the opinion of the writer, the difficulties connected with 
the hypothesis that all neururgic changes have noetic changes 
corresponding with them disappear entirely if we turn our 
attention away from the consideration of activities in certain 
parts of the brain, which are evidently coincident with very 
emphatic and clearly noted alterations within consciousness ; 
and consider the nature of the activity of the nervous system 
as a whole, of which system the brain is merely the pre- 
eminently important part. 
Sec. 3. We find ourselves now-a-days looking upon the 
cortex of the brain as having the same general nature as the
-P-A-G-E-29
  NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 15 
rest of the nervous system, but as a special part which has 
developed within the small confines of the skull, and which, 
in being thus crowded into a compact space, has become 
much folded up, this crowding involving a much closer 
relation between the parts there located than is observed in 
the rest of the nervous system. We thus find a mass of 
important parts of the system concentrated in the brain, the 
activities in which correspond with very marked changes in 
our mental life ; and many thinkers have thus come to look 
upon the brain as the “organ of mind”; and to consider 
the activities of the rest of the nervous system as either of 
relatively small importance, or as of no importance whatever, 
in relation to our mental life. If the nervous system had 
been so arranged that this crowding within the skull had not 
occurred, it is highly improbable that we would have ever 
been tempted to look upon the activities of any part of 
the nervous system as without importance in relation to the 
correspondence between neural activities and changes in 
consciousness which we are here considering. 
Sec. 4. The acute investigations of the neurologist 
during the last century have enormously increased our 
knowledge of the nature of this nervous system, and have 
brought out clearly one fact of great importance to the 
psychologist. They have taught us that the nervous system 
is not a simple system, but is really a system of minor 
systems of hypothetical nervous elements. Within the 
nervous system, taken as a whole, we find minor systems of 
the first order ; one (a) which has to do with environmental 
stimulation ; another (y) which has to do with the organism’s 
reaction upon its environment; and another very broad 
system (8) which has to do with the coordination of minor 
nervous systems (a) and (vy). And within these minor 
nervous systems of the first order we find nervous systems 
of lower orders, one within another in indefinite number. 
Each minor nervous system of one of the lower orders is
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
integrated, as we say, and has its characteristic individuality ; 
but these minor nervous systems of the lower orders as 
such are themselves interrelated and integrated to form 
broader minor systems, and all of these latter are bound 
together to form the highly complex nervous system as a 
whole. 
This being so, it is exceedingly interesting to note that 
the modern introspective psychologist, in like manner, has 
come to the conclusion, in the first place, that consciousness 
is not atomic, but systemic ; but beyond that, that it is a 
vastly complex system of minor psychic systems. We find, 
for instance, minor psychic systems of what we may call the 
first order ; (A) Sensations, which have to do with environ- 
mental stimulation ; (I) Instinct-Experiences, which have 
to do with reaction upon the environment; and (B) the 
very broad realm of Ideas, —of Thoughts,—which has to do 
with the coordination of minor psychic systems A and I. 
And within these minor psychic systems of the first order 
we find minor psychic systems of a second order. In the 
realm (A) of Sensation we have light, sound, etc.; in the 
realm (I) of Instinct-Experiences, various types of emotion, 
for instance, love, anger, etc.; and in the realm (B) of 
Thought a vast array of what, following Stout, we may call 
apperceptive systems. And beyond this, within each of 
these minor psychic systems of the second order, we find an 
indefinite number of minor psychic systems of still lower 
orders. Each minor psychic system of one of the lower 
orders is integrated, as we say, and has its characteristic indi- 
viduality ; but these minor psychic systems of the lower 
orders, as such, are themselves interrelated and integrated 
to form broader minor psychic systems, and all of these 
latter are bound together to form the highly complex psychic 
system which we call consciousness. 
Sec. 5. It seems probable to the writer that if we had 
discovered the broad correspondence above considered before
-P-A-G-E-31
  NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 17 
we had been taught to believe that the activities of the 
cortex of the brain are alone concerned with modifications 
of consciousness, we would not have considered this latter 
hypothesis tenable. On the contrary, we would have 
assumed that the correspondence between what I have 
called neururgic and noetic changes is thoroughgoing : that 
not only is there no modification of consciousness without 
a neururgic change, but that no neururgic change can occur 
without a corresponding modification of consciousness. We 
would have made this assumption because, with the data 
before us, and without the preconceptions with which we 
now approach this subject, we would consider the problem 
somewhat as follows. 
We would begin with the assumption, which I think we 
are entitled to make, that each nervous element is in some 
measure active so long as it is alive. If this is true, then 
whenever we observe what we call a special activity in a 
part of the nervous system, we are dealing really with what 
is merely an emphasis of activity in a special part of an 
all-active system. 
If we thus assume that all parts of the living nervous 
system are active, then we may symbolize its neururgic con- 
dition in spatial terms by conceiving the neural elements to 
be spread out on a plane, and so distributed that each 
neural element would be represented by a little square on a 
flat surface divided by two sets of equidistant lines drawn 
at right angles to one another. We may then represent 
the amount of activity of each element by a certain rise of 
its corresponding little square above the plane. In any 
moment considered, all of the little squares will be raised to 
some degree above the plane, and the amount of their rise 
will vary from moment to moment. Now we have here the 
general conditions which give to us the wave forms upon 
the surface of any liquid, where the particles of water 
rise and fall without being changed in lateral position, 
B
-P-A-G-E-32
    18 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
except by forces which do not here relate to our con- 
sideration. We shall find it useful, therefore, to represent 
the activity of the nervous system by a wave covered liquid 
surface. 
As the nervous system has many points of contact with 
its environment, from which come at any one moment many 
physical impulses of varied kinds, and of varying degrees of 
energy ; so at any moment the several parts of the surface 
by which we represent it will be raised above the fixed plane 
in varied degrees; and at any chosen moment the surface 
will appear as giving a specific configuration which I shall 
speak of as a “neururgic pattern.” I give belowa diagram! 
representing a small section of such a neururgic pattern. 
  At each moment then the nervous system as a whole 
displays what we thus call a meururgic pattern, in which 
certain parts are more markedly active than others. The 
markedly active parts are not the only active parts; but 
their activities are set over in contrast with the great 
body of less markedly active parts, which latter form an 
undifferentiable mass of minor activities against which 
specially marked activities appear as emphases of activity. 
Sec. 6. Having thus represented to ourselves the 
condition of the ever active nervous system we would 
1The reader will recognise that this diagram is copied with some 
changes from one used by Prof. James in his Psychohgy for another 
purpose. 
   
-P-A-G-E-33
  
NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 19 
then argue that, if the neururgic and noetic correspondence 
is thoroughgoing, the condition of consciousness at any 
moment may be described in similar terms as follows. At 
each moment consciousness, which is a vastly complex 
system of noetic systems, displays what we may call a 
noetic pattern in which certain psychic parts are more 
emphatic than others. The markedly emphatic parts are 
not all there is of consciousness in any moment under 
consideration, but these markedly emphatic parts are 
merely set over in contrast from the great body of less 
emphatic parts; which latter form an undifferentiable mass 
of minor psychic parts against which the specially emphatic 
parts appear as psychic emphases. 
And this we find to accord with experience. For in 
the first place we have what’is generally agreed to be ample 
evidence that the psychic states which we designate as the 
field of attention (what under our terminology we would 
call the psychic or noetic emphases) do correspond with 
emphatic activities in parts of the nervous system (what 
I would call the emphases of activity in the neururgic 
pattern). 
This being granted the question would arise whether 
there exists an undifferentiable noetic mass against which 
these noetic emphases are contrasted, corresponding with 
the undifferentiable neururgic mass against which the 
neururgic emphases are contrasted. And to this question 
we would not hesitate to give an affirmative answer. For 
we note that the field of attention, if we may use a current 
ocular simile, spreads out from a clear focus to a margin, 
and this margin to “fringes,” and that these “fringes” 
seem to fade into a vague and elusive aura. Even if 
we experience the most punctual of vivid sensations, for 
instance, it does not seem to exhaust the consciousness of 
the moment; there is always a something more of the 
consciousness of the moment when the sensation appears;  
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
its appearance clearly does not involve the annihilation of 
this rest of consciousness. And this becomes clearer in 
the very fact that we have come to speak of these clear 
elements of attention as presentations. If they are so 
called it must be because they seem to be presentations 
to something; and under our view that to which they 
are presentations is the undifferentiable mass of un- 
emphatic psychic parts which constitutes what we may 
well speak of as the field of inatiention, or sub-attentive 
consciousness. 
This field of sub-attentive consciousness we would hold 
must always exist while life exists, and we would therefore 
contend that the common man is wrong for instance in 
stating that we are unconscious during sleep or in states 
of coma. And if evidence in favor of this contention 
were demanded we would in turn demand from our critic 
evidence that sub-attentive consciousness does not exist 
under such conditions. We would ask him to note that 
the only evidence he has to offer in favor of his view 
is the fact that he is unable to recall in wide-awake life 
any psychic events of the moments of what he calls 
unconsciousness. We would warn him against the common 
fallacy which leads us to assume that when we reflect 
upon a past state we have before us in attention all there 
was of the past state upon which we reflect. And we 
would then show him that his argument if valid would 
compel him to hold that he is unconscious in all moments 
where the psychic events fail of recall in later moments; 
and furthermore, that if he made such a contention he 
would be forced to refer all forgetfulness to moments of 
unconsciousness in the past; a position which would of 
course be untenable. 
Sec. 7. We would then have before us for explanation 
the facts which in the main have led us to the adoption 
of the current theory that the “brain is the organ of
-P-A-G-E-35
  NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 21 
mind” viz. (1) the fact that the occurrences within the 
field of attention (or as we should say the noetic emphases) 
correspond in general with emphatic activities in the cortex 
of the brain; and (2) the fact that a large mass of 
activities in parts of the nervous system other than the 
cortex of the brain are not accompanied by any noticeable 
modifications of consciousness. 
(1) The first fact we would restate in terms of the theory 
of a thoroughgoing neururgic and noetic correspondence by 
saying that the main body of noetic emphases corresponds 
with neururgic emphases within the brain. And this would 
seem to us to be most natural for a number of reasons; first, 
because so large a mass of the nervous system is crowded 
into the brain, where the various parts are cross connected 
and interrelated as is impossible in other parts of the system: 
second, because, in consequence of this fact, and in conse- 
quence of the close relation of the brain to the most highly 
elaborated sense organs, a very large variety of diverse and 
effective stimuli from the environment are brought to bear 
upon the brain: and third, because the brain part of the 
system, if genetically considered, appears to be of late 
development, and because of this must be supposed to be 
markedly mobile, as it were, less fixed in the interrelations of 
its parts, and more subject to disturbances of normal 
functioning, and hence more likely to develop neururgic 
emphases than is the case with the other parts of the whole 
nervous system. 
(2) As to the second point, we would of course agree 
that a large mass of activities in parts of the nervous system 
other than the brain are not accompanied by any noticeable 
modifications of consciousness ; but we would hold that this 
does not stand in opposition to the hypothesis that the 
psychic correspondents of these activities exist, but are part 
and parcel of the vast undifferentiable psychic mass, i.e. the 
field of inattention or sub-attentive consciousness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Sec. 8. Such an hypothesis of thoroughgoing corre- 
spondence as is above outlined I shall assume and make free 
use of in what follows. It is a form of what is now-a-days 
generally called the doctrine of “parallelism.” I shall not 
quarrel about terms; but I purposely call it a theory of 
“correspondence” to indicate that I wish to separate myself 
from those “ parallelists” against whom the sharp arrows of 
Dr. James Ward’s criticisms are aimed.* 
Sec. 9. It will be apparent to the reader that this con- 
ception of the nature of nervous activities, and of coincident 
consciousness, has nothing in common with those atomistic 
theories of mind which were current among the ‘earlier 
advocates of the association psychology. Consciousness is 
not looked upon by us as a mere mass of psychic atoms, nor 
as a mass of psychic atoms which are related together in a 
manner similar to that assumed when we conceive of the 
molecules of which chemistry and physics treat. Rather is 
it looked upon as a unit of vast complexity, in which what 
have been described by the associationists as though they 
were psychic atoms and molecules, are considered rather as 
centers of emphasis within the whole pulse of activity of 
the whole complex psychic system. 
The reader will of course also perceive that this notion 
that consciousness must be looked upon as a psychic system 
is one which is involved in all the opposition to the atomistic 
psychology which has been so marked a feature of the work 
done by the masters of Psychology during the past fifty 
1 Confer his Naturalism and Agnosticism. 1 agree with Dr. Ward that a 
metaphysical position of doubtful validity is usually involved in the state- 
ments of the doctrine of “parallelism”; but I would maintain that a 
theory of correspondence may be held by, and found exceedingly useful to, 
the psychologist who, remaining within the field peculiar to his work, 
waives all questions as to the meaning of this correspondence, and declines 
to involve himself in the dispute between those who claim, and those 
who deny, that there is a causal relation between mental and bodily 
activities,

  years. The importance of the implications have not, how- 
ever, in my view, been thoroughly realized even by these 
masters." 
II 
The general considerations presented in the preceding 
sections may well be followed here by a study of the 
conceptions to. which our main hypothesis leads ; in which 
we may note in some detail the neururgic and _noetic 
correspondences to be referred to in the pages to follow. 
In order that these correspondences may be made clear 
we place in parallel columns the remarks to be made in 
reference to neural activities and to the psychic corre- 
spondences respectively. 
Sec. 10a. When we speak 
of a nervous system, we imply Sec. 10b. Such parts of con- 
sciousness as we are able to observe 
that the parts of the nerve 
substance which we are able 
to observe as spatially separable 
from one another, are so related 
that what we call an activity 
in one special part affects in 
some measure the nature of 
the activity in each and every 
other part of the whole nervous 
system; the activity of the 
special part being at the same in reflection, appear to form a 
psychic system. But we realize 
that what appears in reflection 
is only part of the whole of con- 
sciousness; and this whole of 
consciousness is to be looked upon 
as a psychic system broader than 
that which appears in the field 
of reflective attention, When we 
speak of consciousness thus we 
imply that it is a complex whole 
time influenced by the nature in which certain parts are so 
1 As late instances of this specific recognition I may refer to the fact that 
Pierre Janet treats of consciousness as a coordinated system of elements, a 
system capable of disruption or “ disordination” ; its component elements 
existing in a more or less isolated condition as “ sub-conscious” states. (Cf. 
Philosophical Review, xi. 6, p. 657.) Spiller in his The Mind of Man bases 
his whole study of our mental life on the conception’ of consciousness’ as 
systematized. This work was completed in draft before Spiller’s work 
appeared ; and the reader will perceive that my method, and my use of 
this conception, differ altogether from his.
-P-A-G-E-38
    24 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
of the coincident activities in 
each and every other part of 
the nervous system. 
Sec. 11a. We thus speak of 
neural elements; and of the 
whole nervous system as made 
up of such elements; and we 
are liable to speak of these 
elements at times as though 
they were of the nature of 
the atoms of the physicist. 
But as a matter of fact we 
do not think of them as such ; 
for we realize that they are 
not elements apart from the 
system, but that they are con- 
ditioned by the very fact that 
they are inherent parts of the 
system, and are not separable 
from the system, of which they 
form parts, without a_ total 
alteration of their nature. 
In like manner we speak of 
elemental neural activities ; but 
we realize that we are able to 
observe these so called elemental 
activities only in connection with 
the activities of the system, emphatic that they stand apart, 
as it were, from the remainder ; 
these parts being so related that 
in any given moment each special 
psychic emphasis affects in some 
measure the nature of each and 
every other part of the whole 
psychic system; the nature of 
any special psychic emphasis being 
at the same time influenced by 
the nature of each and all of 
the other psychic elements within 
the whole of consciousness as it 
exists in that moment. 
Sec. 116. We may thus also 
speak of psychic elements, and 
of consciousness as made up of 
such psychic elements: but we 
must realize that these are not 
elements apart from the conscious 
system, but that they are con- 
ditioned by the fact that they 
are inherent parts of this conscious 
system; and that they are not 
separable from the psychic system 
of which they form parts without 
a total alteration of their nature. 
If then we speak of the recog- 
nition of elemental psychic states, 
we must realize that we are able 
to observe them only in relation 
to the psychic system as a whole, 
which is a unit so long as it
-P-A-G-E-39
ee eee 
  NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES — 25 
which acts as a unit so long 
as it is a system ; and we thus 
see that the elemental parts 
of the nervous system are dis- 
tinguished only because they are 
capable of becoming the centers 
of specially emphatic activity, 
within the system, which as a 
whole is more or less gradually 
affected by the emphatic activity 
appearing in the parts. 
We can never conceive of 
a specially active neural element, 
as part and parcel of the system, 
without also conceiving of the 
related activities of the neryous 
system as a whole. The neural 
elements are not isolated atoms, 
but are inherent parts of the 
nervous system: the nervous 
system is not a mere aggrega- 
tion of atoms, but it is what 
it is because it is formed of 
what we call neural elements, 
which under certain conditions 
may become the centers of 
emphasis of newly appearing 
activities within the system as 
a whole. 
It thus appears that what 
we speak of as a special activity 
in a special part of the nervous 
system is really to be looked 
upon merely as an emphasis 
of activity in this part of the 
whole active system. 
Sec. 12a. The nervous system 
of man is observed to be, not 
merely a system, but a vastly remains a conscious system; and 
that the elemental parts of the 
psychic system are capable of 
becoming the centers of special 
emphasis, within the psychic sys- 
tem, which as a whole is more 
or less gradually affected by the 
emphases appearing in the parts. 
We can never conceive of the 
special emphasis of a psychic ele- 
ment, as part and parcel of the 
whole psychic system, without also 
implicating the other related parts 
of the psychic system, i.e. the rest 
of consciousness. The psychic 
elements are what they are, be- 
cause they are inherent parts of 
the whole of consciousness ; con- 
sciousness is what it is, because 
it is formed of what we call 
psychic elements, which under 
certain conditions may become the 
centers of emphasis of new forms 
appearing in the psychic system 
as a whole. 
It thus appears that what we 
speak of as a special presentation 
is to be looked upon merely as 
a psychic emphasis in a special 
part of the whole active psychic 
system which we call conscious- 
ness. 
Sec. 126. Consciousness may 
be looked upon as a vastly complex 
system of minor psychic systems.

complex system of minor sys- 
tems. The elements within any 
one of these minor systems are 
interrelated more closely than 
they are related to the elements 
of diverse minor systems. 
The minor systems them- 
selves are all related within 
the broad system as a whole : 
in some cases, however, the 
bond of relation is closer, in 
other cases it is less close. 
Certain of these minor systems 
are so closely related that the 
broad system seems mutilated 
when they are extirpated. Cer- 
tain others (¢.g. the sympathetic 
nervous system) are so loosely 
related to the nervous system 
taken as a whole that they 
seem to act in great measure 
independently of the whole 
broad system. We realize how- 
ever that this independence 
cannot be complete. So long 
as any minor nervous system 
is inherently connected with, 
as part of, the broad general 
nervous system, neither it, nor 
any of its elements, can become 
the center of emphatic activities 
without the production of some 
effect in all other parts of the 
nervous system. 
Sec. 13a. As each neural 
element must be supposed to be 
in some measure active so long 
as it is alive, the parts which 
are emphatically active at any Thus our aural presentations as 
such are systematized, as are also 
our ocular presentations as such ; 
yet both are interrelated as parts 
of the whole system of conscious- 
ness. 
Similar relations exist between 
the minor psychic systems and 
the broad system as a whole; 
relations which must also be more 
or less intimate. Certain of these 
minor psychic systems (¢.g. the 
somatic sensations) are known to 
be so loosely related to the whole 
of consciousness that they seem 
to many to be in great measure 
uninfluential in the experience of 
daily life. Other minor psychic 
systems (eg. those corresponding 
with the reflex actions) seem to 
bear no yelation whatever to clear 
consciousness. This we are com- 
pelled however to view as an 
illusion. So long as any minor 
psychic system is inherently con- 
nected with, as part of, the broad 
system of consciousness, neither 
it, nor any of its elements, can 
become emphasized in any degree 
without the occurrence of some 
change in each and every part 
of the whole of consciousness of 
the moment. 
Sec. 136. Consciousness must 
thus be looked upon as a very 
complex system of psychic systems 
composed of psychic parts which 
may be diversely emphasized. At
-P-A-G-E-41
  NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 27 
moment must be small in 
number in comparison with the 
great mass of the system which 
is composed of parts which are 
unemphatically active. But this 
fact does not lead us to say that 
only those parts of the whole 
system are active in which the 
activities appear emphatic. On 
the contrary, at each moment the 
whole complex nervous system, 
active in all its parts, must 
be viewed as acting as an unit, 
subject to variations of emphasis 
in its several parts.” 
Sec. 14a. It is clear that an 
emphasis in the nervous activities 
at any chosen moment may 
appear to arise in any of an 
indefinitely large number of 
parts of the complex system ; 
and as the nervous system is 
a complex system of minor 
systems, diverse neururgic em- 
phases may appear in several 
minor systems at one and the 
same time. 
1Confer McDougall, Mind, N.S. 43. 
in the whole nervous system these special emphases occur. any moment the part of conscious- 
ness which is thus emphatic is 
narrow in relation to the vast 
mass of consciousness which is not 
emphasized. The part of con- 
sciousness which is emphasized is 
what we usually speak of as the 
field of attention. But we are 
bound to assume the existence in 
consciousness, at each moment; of 
a vast body of unemphatic parts, 
which are not of the field of 
attention, and which make up what 
we may well call the field of inatten- 
tion or subattentive consciousness. 
Sec.14b. Our experience shows 
us that these special emphases in 
consciousness, these special pre- 
sentations, may arise in any of an 
indefinitely large number of parts 
of consciousness, if we may so speak. 
And as we have come to look upon 
consciousness as a complex system 
of minor psychic systems we shall 
not be surprised to find that we 
may experience what appear to be 
diverse noetic emphases, or partial 
presentations, in one and the same 
moment. 
It matters not at what points 
The seat of 
these emphases may possibly be found to be in the “synapses” so called, 
i.e. at the points of juncture between connecting lines of nervous matter. 
But this will not lead us to deny that the parts of nervous substance 
in these connecting lines themselves are in each moment active. 
2Prof. Loeb (Physiohgy of the Brain, p. 262) says; 
of association the cerebral hemispheres act as a whole, 
mosaic of a number of independent parts.” “In processes 
and not as a

  28 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
If we consider the active 
nervous system as a whole at 
any moment, we may speak of 
this whole as a “neururgic 
system,” in which appears a vast 
complication of special emphases 
of greater or less degree. The 
condition of the neururgicsystem 
at any moment we may speak 
of as constituting a “neururgic 
pattern.” The neururgic pat- 
terns of successive moments will 
alter as the centers of emphasis 
within the neururgic system of 
systems change in successive 
moments. 
Sec. 15a. Because emphatic 
activities attract attention, we 
are of course not warranted in 
holding that the points of 
emphasis alone constitute the 
neururgic pattern of the moment; 
they could not appear as incre- 
ments to the activity of the 
whole unemphatic mass unless 
this unemphatic mass existed as 
part of the whole condition of 
the neururgic system of the 
moment; and the nature of 
the neururgic pattern of any 
moment is determined as much 
by the body of unemphatic, as by 
the smaller number of emphatic, 
neural activities. Jn considering 
the nature of any neururgic pat- 
tern we can never overlook the 
influence of the whole neururgic 
system, as apart from the neururgic If we consider consciousness as 
a whole at any moment, we may 
speak of it as a “‘ noetic system,” in 
which appears a vast complication 
of special emphases of greater or 
less degree. The condition of the 
noetic system at any moment we 
may speak of as a “ noetic pattern.” 
The noetic patterns of successive 
moments will be found to alter as 
the centers of psychic emphasis 
within the noetic system of systems 
change in successive moments. 
Sec. 156. Because these em- 
phatic experiences are retained in 
reflection is of course no reason 
why we should hold that these 
points of emphasis alone constitute 
the noetic pattern of the moment ; 
they could not appear as presenta- 
tions to the whole unemphatic 
psychic mass, which we speak of 
as the field of inattention, were it 
not that this mass exists as part of 
the whole condition of the noetic 
system of the moment,—as part 
of the sum-total of the conscious- 
ness of the moment; and the nature 
of the noetic pattern within con- 
sciousness. at any moment is 
determined as much by the broad 
field of inattention as it is by the 
narrow field of attention. Jn con- 
sidering the nature of any noetic 
pattern we can never overlook the

emphases, in affecting the nature 
of these neururgic emphases, 
Sec. 16a. Closer relations 
exist between certain nerve 
elements within the nervous 
system, than between certain 
others. When we describe the 
nervous system as a system of 
minor nervous systems we mean 
that in any group of nerve 
elements constituting a minor 
system, a closer relation exists 
between the elements within 
this group, than between any of 
them and any outside of the 
group. The elements hold to- 
gether and act as individual parts 
within the broad system, in a 
measure as though they had an 
existence independent from the 
whole broad nervous system. 
When a minor nerve system 
becomes emphatically active its 
activity will necessarily affect 
in some measure the whole 
neururgic pattern of the mo- 
ment; but the degree and 
permanence of the effect pro- 
duced in succeeding neururgic 
patterns, and the persistence of 
the neururgic emphasis due to 
this activity in the minor system, 
will depend altogether upon the 
nature of the neururgic relations 
existing in the whole system at 
the moment. Whether the 
minor nerve system is in close influence of the whole noetic system, 
as apart from the noetic emphases, in 
affecting the nature of these noetic 
emphases. 
Sec. 164. When we describe 
consciousness as a system of minor 
psychic systems we mean that in 
any psychic grouping that forms a 
minor psychic system (e.g. sensa- 
tions) closer relations exist between 
the elements within the group (eg. 
light, heat, sound, etc.) than be- 
tween any of them and any outside 
of the group (¢g. an emotion or 
concept). The elements as thus 
grouped appear to have as it 
were an independent existence, yet 
within and part of the whole 
psychic system which we call 
consciousness. 
When a minor noetic system 
becomes emphatic it will neces- 
sarily affect in some measure 
the whole noetic pattern of the 
moment; but the degree and 
permanence of the effect produced 
in succeeding noetic patterns, and 
the persistence of the new noetic 
emphasis as such, will depend 
altogether upon the nature of 
the noetic conditions existing 
within consciousness at the moment. 
Whether the minor noetic system 
is in close relation, or not, with 
the mass of consciousness deter- 
mines whether the noetic pattern

    30 OF CONSCIOUSNE! 
relation, or not, with the mass 
of the neururgic system deter- 
mines whether the neururgic 
pattern in future moments will, 
or will not, be influenced by the 
special activity in the minor 
system. That is to say, it de- 
termines whether or not, the 
emphasis within the minor 
neururgic system is to persist as 
an emphasis within the whole 
neururgic system. If it does 
not, and if this minor system 
emphasis persists, then the minor 
neururgic system will be prac- 
tically cut away from the 
neururgic system as a whole. 
A minor nerve system may be 
in close relation with the mass 
of the whole complex system, 
and nevertheless whether the 
effect of the minor system’s 
activity will be great or small in 
future moments depends upon 
whether the rhythm of activity 
in the minor system is, or is not, 
commensurable with that of the 
whole mass. 
We here deal with Neururgic 
Assimilation. The whole neu- 
rurgic system in any moment 
presents a special “ physiological 
disposition” (Stout). Whether 
the newly arising activity is to 
become effectively emphatic, or 
not, depends upon whether it is,     
   IN GENERAL 
   in future moments will, or will 
not, be influenced by the new 
noetic emphasis. In other words, 
it determines whether or not the 
emphasis within the minor noetic 
system is to persist as an emphasis 
within consciousness as a whole. 
If it does not it may in a sense 
persist as a psychic activity, but 
then it must be apart from the 
noetic system which we call con- 
sciousness. 
A minor noetic system may be 
in close relation with conscious- 
ness as a whole, and nevertheless 
whether its effect upon conscious- 
ness will be great or small in 
future moments depends upon 
whether its rhythm of activity, if 
we may so speak, is, or is not, 
commensurable with that of the 
whole noetic mass. Thus the 
surface wound does not affect 
the consciousness of the fighting 
soldier ; but gives him great pain 
when the battle is over. 
We here deal with Noeetic 
Assimilation. The whole noetic 
system in any moment presents 
a special “psychical disposition ” 
(Stout). Whether or not the 
newly arising noetic emphasis is 
to persist depends upon whether 
it is, or is not, assimilated by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
NOETIC-NEURURGIC CORRESPONDENCES 31 
or is not, assimilated by the 
physiological disposition of the 
moment. 
Sec. 17a. It thus appears 
that each emphasis of activity 
in a neural part will in some 
measure affect the activities of 
all related parts: and not only 
the degree of this effect, but 
also the rapidity of the spread 
of its influence, will depend 
upon the closeness of the re- 
lation between the part in which 
the emphasis appears, and the 
rest of the whole complex 
nervous mass.! 
The activity of the part in 
which the emphasis appears is 
also affected by the activities of 
all the other parts of the system. 
The result of this reciprocity 
is that the neururgic pattern 
must always tend to change in 
the direction of what we may “psychical disposition” of the 
moment. We are here dealing 
with what is often spoken of as 
the process of Apperception. 
Sec. 17). It thus appears that 
each special emphasis (or presen- 
tation) in attention must affect 
the whole of consciousness, not 
only that part which is within the 
confines of the field of attention, 
but also those parts which make 
up the field of inattention ; and 
the degree of this effect, and the 
rapidity of the spread of its in- 
fluence, will depend altogether 
upon the closeness of the relation 
between the part in which the 
emphasis appears and the rest of 
consciousness. 
So also the part of consciousness 
which is of the field of attention 
must be affected by the parts of 
consciousness which are of the field 
of inattention. 
The noetic pattern must thus 
always tend to lose its specific 
character. As the emphasis within 
the field of attention eventually 
1Mr. George Henry Lewes (The Physical Basis of Mind, p. 284) uses 
the following illustration ; “Imagine all the nerve centers to be a con- 
nected group of bells varying in size. Every agitation of the connecting 
wire will more or less agitate all the bells; but since some are heavier 
than others, and some of the cranks less movable, there will be many 
vibrations of the wire which will cause some bells to sound, others simply 
to oscillate without sounding, and others not sensibly to oscillate. Even 
some of the lighter bells will not ring if any external pressure arrests them ; 
or if they are already ringing, the added impulse, not being rhythmically 
timed, will arrest ringing,” etc., etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
32 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
figuratively describe as a level 
surface; the emphasis eventu- 
ally affecting, and being affected 
by, the whole mass of activities. 
Any special emphasis will thus 
tend to disappear, as it were, 
within the increased activity of 
the mass, unless the emphasis is 
continuously produced by direct 
stimulation from the environ- 
ment: and this because the 
energy given out by the em- 
phatic part has raised the grade 
of activity of the whole mass ; 
the special part, as well as the 
mass, tending to gain a similar 
degree of activity, which results 
in the tendency to obliteration 
of the special emphasis as such. 
Sec. 18a. Lack of stimuli 
from the environment will thus 
tend to result in a disappear- 
ance of all of the neururgic 
pattern: the neururgic system 
will tend to come to a dead 
level, if we may so speak. In 
a similar manner incapacity 
for action within the nervous 
system, due to toxic effects, or 
to weariness, (if this is not to be 
numbered with toxic effects,) 
or to malnutrition, may act to 
wipe out all semblance of a 
neururgic pattern, and to pro- 
duce a “dead level” condition. 
It must be agreed however that 
while this “dead level” may be 
approximated to, it can never 
be reached while the human affects, and is affected by, that part 
of consciousness which is of the 
field of inattention, the result will 
be a tendency to a reduction of 
the emphasis within the field of 
attention, unless this emphasis 
is continuously produced by re- 
current stimulation. We thus 
observe a constant tendency to the 
loss of certain elements of any 
presentation which appear in at- 
tention, and which are not due 
to distinct continuing stimulation 
from without themselves; and 
this because the emphatic elements 
have become absorbed, as it were, 
within the field of inattention. 
Sec. 18d. Consciousness will 
thus require a constant ebullition 
of presentations due to action upon 
us from the environment if it is 
to retain a recognizable noetic 
pattern. And at times, even when 
these constant actions upon us 
from our environment occur, 
weariness, or intoxications of one 
kind or another, or malnutrition, 
may result in states in which the 
noetic pattern seems to disappear 
altogether ;—in which there seems 
to be no field of attention, and 
naught but the field of inatten- 
tion. 
It must be agreed however that 
while such an appearance of total 
inattention may be approximated 
to, it can never be actually

nervous system is a living active 
thing affected by varied in- 
fluences reaching it from the 
environment. 
Sec. 1ga. It is clear that 
accident, or the surgeon’s knife, 
or disease, may. result in the 
separation of the whole nervous 
system separate parts, 
which are physically discon- 
nected. Within the same body 
then have separate 
nervous systems, each of which 
will act as a unit and will 
express itself by appropriate 
actions. 
But we may surmise also that 
certain minor nervous systems 
may attain to such relative grade 
of activity that they will for 
the time being throb as separate 
nervous systems, and become 
practically separated from the 
rest of the whole nervous system 
which isincapable at the moment 
of a similar grade of activity. 
Such a separation of parts of 
the whole nervous system we 
may describe as due to an in- 
commensurability of the minor 
neururgic systems, and that of 
the rest of the major neururgic 
system taken as a whole. into

nervous systems may at times 
appear to drop away from the 
normal activity of the broad

reached in man while conscious- 
ness exists. 
Sec. 19. As the result of dis- 
sociation of broad psychic systems 
within an individual, diverse con- 
sciousnesses may exist in connec- 
tion with the same human body, 
whether as the result of accident, 
or surgical operation, or disease: 
and although only one of these 
consciousnesses will normally be 
connected with the expressions of 
speech and the thoughts related 
thereto, the existence of the other 
consciousnesses cannot be denied. 
We may expect also to discover 
indications of the occasional separa- 
tion of consciousnesses within the 
same human body, as the result of 
the attainment by one partial minor 
psychic system of a grade of 
emphasis which cannot for the 
moment be approached by the 
other parts of consciousness taken 
as a whole. Such a separation 
of parts of consciousness we may 
describe as due to an incommen- 
surability between the grades of 
psychic activity of the 
psychic system, and that of the 
rest of the major psychic system 
taken as a whole. 
Thus large parts of consciousness 
may at times seem to disappear 
from that which we call our own 
consciousness in which marked 
noetic patterns are developed ;—viz.

as a whole; and upon occasion 
may appear to be again rejoined 
thereto. 
Sec. 20a. If we look upon 
the activity of the nervous 
system as a whole it appears in 
any special moment as a unit— 
as a single pulse. If we con- 
sider it as existing through 
successive moments, then the 
successive emphases, however 
diverse be the parts in which 
they arise, will appear as a 
continuum of emphases: the 
emphasis of one moment shading 
off into the emphasis of the next 
moment. the consciousness which expresses 
itself in speech: and upon occasion 
these lost parts may be expected 
to appear to be again rejoined to 
the consciousness which we call 
our own. 
Sec. 20b. If we consider con- 
sciousness as a whole it appears in 
any special moment as a unit—as 
a single psychic pulse. If we con- 
sider it as existing through succes- 
sive moments, then the successive 
emphases within consciousness 
which we call presentations will 
appear as a continuum, the emphasis 
(or presentation) of one moment 
shading off into the emphasis (or 
presentation) of the next moment ; 
and this gives us the experience of 
what Dr. James Ward calls the 
“presentation continuum.”

  CHAPTER III 
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SELF? 
I 
Sec. 1. In our first chapter we have described certain 
general characteristics of human consciousness as it appears 
in introspection ; let us now consider the facts brought to 
view in the primary analysis quite objectively—i.e. as 
happening in the conscious life of other individuals than 
ourselyes—and study the relation of these facts to the 
neururgic situations in those individuals’ bodies. 
Sec. 2. We have seen that when our friend examines the 
nature of his conscious states he always discovers what may 
be described as an emphasis in consciousness commonly 
called a presentation, which is contrasted with a vague and 
elusive something else of consciousness which we call his 
Self. 
Beyond this we have seen that he often notes that out of 
this vague and elusive Self there appears to emerge a some- 
what more explicit with which the self-same psychic emphasis 
also appears to stand in contrast, a somewhat which he 
commonly calls his self, but which upon reflection appears 
to be in itself a part of the presentation, and not the Self. 
It is what we speak of as the ego of self-consciousness. 
1The substance of this chapter was presented in an article entitled 
Consciousness, Self-Consciousness, and the Self, published in Mind, N.S. 
January, 1901.  
-P-A-G-E-50
    
36 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
As we shall see more fully in Chapter xxm., it is 
unnecessary to present to one who knows his Lotze? 
and his James? any argument to show how thoroughly 
presentative this ego of self-consciousness is. We shall 
hereafter call it the empirical ego to distinguish it from 
the true Self. 
When we say that it appears to emerge from the Self we 
mean to say that we think of it as of the same nature as the 
Self to which we are convinced it is a presentation, or a part 
of a complex presentation. And this would seem to be 
corroborated by the fact that often the same noetic emphasis 
which in one moment appears only in contrast with, as a 
presentation to, the Self ; at another moment may appear as 
an object in contrast with the ego, both this object and the 
ego forming a complex dual presentation to the Self. For 
instance, a brilliant flash light seems to our friend to stand 
out sharp and distinct and individual, yet not to exhaust the 
consciousness of the moment in which it appears ; there also 
exists for him the something more of consciousness which 
we call his Self. But presently my friend finds the presenta- 
tion consisting of the flash light as before, and in addition 
thereto himself, his empirical ego, as related to the flash 
light. The flash light and the ego to which it is related 
together however do not exhaust his consciousness of the 
moment, but appear as a presentation of double emphasis, if 
we may so speak, to the non-presentable Self. 
In other words his empirical ego appears to our friend to 
be fundamentally of the same nature as his Self, to be in 
fact a presentative simulacrum of his Self, which of course 
cannot be presented for the simple reason that it sis that 
part of his consciousness to which his presentations are 
given.

    SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SELF 37 
Il 
Sec. 3. Let us now ask whether our hypothesis of 
neururgic and noetic correspondence helps us to compre- 
hend the facts which thus seem given to us. 
~The nervous system, as we have so often said, is a vastly 
complex system of minor nervous systems of what we choose 
to speak of as nervous elements, all of which are in some 
measure active during life. These elements are so bound 
together that any emphatic activity in any one element must, 
directly or indirectly, influence the activities of all the rest of 
the elements of the system, and must in turn be influenced by 
them. It thus appears, as we have seen, that if the complex 
nerve system is considered as a whole the action of any 
element which is especially marked must be looked upon as 
an emphasis of activity within the whole system, rather than 
as an isolated activity. 
It is easy to see that the activity of some particular 
nervous element, or of some narrowly limited minor system 
of elements, may be very markedly emphasized, and that it 
will then stand away in contrast from the whole great mass 
of unemphatic activities of the rest of the whole complex 
system ;—/.e. although it will be part and parcel of the whole 
active system, nevertheless it will appear as an increment of 
activity to the broad undifferentiable mass of activities of 
the whole complex. Such a case is represented in Fig. 3. 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
_-~ Here the immensely complex nervous system is repre- 
sented in an artificially simplified manner, but sufficiently for 
our purpose. The groups of circles (L, M, N, O, etc.) 
represent minor nervous systems. The groups of minor 
systems, A, B, I’, represent respectively (A) those which 
relate to stimuli reaching us from our environment; (I) 
those which relate to our reaction upon the environment ; 
and (B) those which are concerned with the coordination of 
the activities of groups A and I. Q in group A represents 
a limited minor system of elements in which an emphatic 
activity (P) appears ; and all the other interconnected circles 
taken together represent the great mass of unemphatic 
activities to which the emphatic activity in P appears as an 
increment. 
Now, when we have a vivid sensational presentation, for 
instance, we know that the sensation corresponds with the 
emphatic activity of such a relatively narrowly limited part 
of a minor nervous system as is represented by P in Fig. 3, 
coupled with heightened activities in the nerve parts most 
directly connected with P; and, if our hypothesis of a 
thoroughgoing correspondence between neural activities and 
consciousness is correct, we should look for a something else 
of consciousness corresponding with the broad undifferen- 
tiable mass of unemphatic nervous activities in those parts 
of the whole system which are not thus emphatically 
active. 
4, But as we have already seen such a vivid sensation in 
reflection does appear as a presentation to a something else 
of consciousness which we call the Self: and most naturally 
the hypothesis is suggested that the Self of any moment is 
nothing more nor less than the psychic correspondent of the 
broad mass of unemphatic nervous activities, existing within 
the whole system, which form a background against which 
the emphatic activities of the minor nervous systems stand 
in contrast. 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SELF 39 
Sec. 4. If this is a true explanation of the nature of the 
relation of ordinary non-reflective vivid presentations to the 
Self, it is easy to comprehend how presentations to the Self 
of a more complex nature may exist in correspondence with 
more complex increments of activity within the whole com- 
plex neururgic system; so that we find no difficulty in 
explaining in such terms our most complicated presentations 
to the Self. The emphatic neururgic emphases fade off into 
the undifferentiable activities in the mass of the nervous 
system. The neururgic emphases correspond with the noetic 
emphases which we call presentations and which make up 
what we call the field of attention: the undifferentiable 
psychic mass, which is held to correspond with the undiffer- 
entiable neururgic mass, may well therefore be described as 
the field of inattention against which the field of attention is 
contrasted : and if it is true that what we usually describe 
as the Self is this undifferentiable psychic mass, then we may 
well describe she Self as the field of inattention to which the 
presentations within the field of attention accrue. 
Sec. 5. It remains for us to consider the neururgic corre- 
spondence with our states of self-consciousness. 
In Fig. 3 above we have represented the case where some 
elementary part, P, of a minor nervous system within the 
whole nervous system of a man is raised to a relatively high 
degree of activity, carrying with it heightened activity in 
certain very closely related parts. In such a case, under our 
hypothesis, we have in consciousness the general psychic 
mass, i.e. the Self, to which is added the forceful presenta- 
tion P. Such is the psychic state when we receive a sharp 
blow, or when we hear a sudden noise, or see a flash of 
lightning. 
But the elements of each of the minor nervous systems 
represented in the Fig. 3 by the groups L, M, N, O, etc., 
must be supposed to be more closely interrelated,—more 
closely bound together,—than the minor systems themselves 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
are, one with another: it is indeed only because of this 
close bond between the elements within the minor systems 
that these latter appear as special parts in the wider system. 
And it is easy to see that certain groups of these minor 
neural systems in their turn may be more closely bound 
together than other groups. Beyond this it is also easy to 
see that a vast array of these groups of minor systems may 
become closely bound together in a great minor system 
which might exist in a more or less stable form, but differen- 
tiable only as a mass, within the still broader whole system ; 
and then we might under certain conditions find the activities 
in such a broad mass appearing as a unit as an increment 
to the activities in the vastly complex system as a whole; as 
per Fig. 4 below. 
  
  And at times we might even find what we may call a 
secondary increment of activity within some elementary part 
of this broad mass itself, and contrasted with it: this incre- 
ment, and the broad mass together standing out in contrast 
with the activities of the vastly complex system taken as a 
whole. 
This situation may be represented by Fig. 5 below : 
In such a case as that depicted in Fig. 4 the noetic situa- 
tion which corresponds with the neururgic situation thus 
represented would, under the hypothesis here presented,
-P-A-G-E-55
  SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SELF 4 
give us a case of self-consciousness in which the empirical 
ego alone appears, as it does now when our minds are 
concentrated upon the thought of it. In the figure the 
darkened portions represent the empirical ego, and all the 
undarkened portions the Self to which this ego is pre- 
sented. 
  
  
  In such a case, as that represented in Fig. 5, under our 
hypothesis, we would have in consciousness exactly what we 
find in our experience of complex self-conscious states. The 
darker portions in the diagram will here represent the whole 
dual presentation to the Self: the Self being represented by 
all the unshaded portions of the diagram. But in such a 
case the presentation to the Self consists (1st) of the 
empirical ego L+M+N+S+T+U+V+W+X+Y+4Z; 
and (2nd) of the object related to this empirical ego ; which 
object is represented by P, and the parts closely related 
thereto. 
In the symbols above used the simplification is thoroughly 
artificial. The systems symbolized are immensely more 
numerous and more complex, and immensely more irregular 
in their distribution, and in the manner of their intercon- 
nection, than the diagram would suggest. But if we allow 
for these weaknesses it seems to me that we have in these 
symbols a suggestion which may lead us to a fuller 
 
-P-A-G-E-56

42 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
comprehension of the general nature of consciousness, and 
especially of the experience of self-consciousness. 
| IIl 
Sec. 6. Such an hypothesis as that above presented may 
well appear to the reader to be too far removed from the 
possibility of verification to be conclusive. Nevertheless if 
we consider its implications we find them helpful in com- 
prehending the nature of consciousness as it appears in 
reflection. 
In the first place we find the study of this hypothesis 
_-~, emphasizing the importance of the fact that consciousness is 
a vastly complex system of minor psychic systems; and that 
the presentations in attention are mere emphases in parts of 
this very complex psychic system. This means that in each 
moment of our conscious life there exists, beyond the field 
of attention, a broad field of inattention, to which the pre- 
sentations within attention accrue. This broad field of 
inattention, under this hypothesis, is identical with the Self 
of the moment’s experience, which we find ourselves com- 
pelled always to assume as a vague background, in and of 
consciousness, against which presentations stand out more or 
less clearly in attention. 
If this is true, then it appears that we are forced to the 
important conclusion that as the field of attention is not 
diverse from, but is merely an emphasized item of, the field   
of inattention ; so the Self must be fundamentally of the same 
general nature as the presentations to the Self. 
Furthermore it appears, under this hypothesis, that if any 
broad minor psychic system, within the whole of conscious- 
ness, exists as very thoroughly integrated within the whole 
vastly complex psychic system, it must be a simulacrum of 
this whole system which we call consciousness; as the darker 
portions in Fig. 5 taken by themselves form a simulacrum
-P-A-G-E-57
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SELF 43 
of the whole of Fig. 3. The empirical ego of self- 
consciousness and its object together are under this view 
given as an emphasis of such a very thoroughly integrated 
broad minor psychic system. Here the object in the self- 
conscious state appears as fundamentally of the same nature 
as, and as a simulacrum of the presentation to the Self ; and 
we are led thus to see how it happens that the ego of self- 
consciousness is appreciated as fundamentally of the same 
general nature as, and as a simulacrum of, the Self to which 
presentations are given. 
It follows then that the Self must be related to its 
presentations fundamentally in the same way that the 
empirical ego is related to its objects in our self-conscious 
states :—that the reciprocal reaction, if we may so speak, which 
we observe between the empirical ego and its objects, must 
be paralleled by a reciprocal reaction between the Self and its 
presentations, whether this presentation be one in which 
self-consciousness is not involved (i.e. where no part of the 
presentation appears as an empirical ego), or one where self- 
consciousness is involved (i.e. where the presentation consists 
of an empirical ego and also of an object contrasted with it). 
We thus see also that the reciprocal reaction between the 
Self and the presentations to this Self must always be 
implicit: we can never get rid of the effect of the whole 
mass of the system upon the presentation, nor can the 
presentation ever fail to affect the nature of the whole mass 
of the system apart from the presentation, ze. the Self. 
When therefore a broad minor psychic system, e.g. the 
empirical ego, is presented to the Self, then in the nature 
and efficiency of the empirical ego, which is a simulacrum of 
the Self, as it appears in attention, the nature and efficiency 
of the non-presentable Self become explicit. In our analysis 
of presentations which is to follow in the second book, we 
must therefore be prepared always to observe the reciprocal _ 
reaction of the Self and of the presentation to the Self, which “ 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
when explicit will appear as the reciprocal reaction of the 
empirical ego and of the objects related to this empirical 
ego. 
This ever present reaction of the Self upon its presenta- 
tions, when it becomes explicit in the reaction of the 
empirical ego upon its object, is the most important 
exemplification of what we speak of as conation or will. 
It appears therefore that this reaction of the Self in conation 
or will is implicit in all of our conscious states. If in the 
course of these studies we find evidence of such reciprocal 
reaction between the Self and the presentations to it, we 
shall have an important verification of the theoretical 
position here presented. 
It thus appears also that the nature of the non-presentable 
Self, and of its efficiency in relation to presentations in 
general, may be judged from a study of the nature of the 
empirical ego and of its efficiency in relation to the objects 
which are contrasted with it. The study of this nature of 
the Self we shall therefore take up in Book 111., after, in 
Book 11., we have made an analysis of the nature of pre- 
sentations as they appear in attention, in both non-self- 
conscious, and self-conscious states. 
Sec. 7. Some reader may here tell us that we cannot too 
readily assume that consciousness in our ordinary non- 
reflective moments is of the same nature as consciousness 
in moments of our reflective life. But if the views above 
presented are correct it appears that the nature of our non- 
reflective conscious states may, as a matter of fact, be judged 
from our study of the nature of the relation of the objects 
related to the empirical ego, and of presentations to the Self 
where no self-consciousness is involved. We realize that 
what appear at times as objects (¢.g. sensations) contrasted 
with the empirical ego of self-consciousness, may at other 
times appear as mere presentations in non-self-conscious 
states where there is no recognition of an ego to which the
-P-A-G-E-59
    
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SELF 45 
sensations are given. So we may judge that in non-reflective 
moments, consciousness may well appear to consist of a mere 
series of presentations. And we may further assume that at 
times there may be so complete a lack of emphasis in con- 
sciousness that the non-reflective state may consist practically 
of the whole of the psychic system : then consciousness will 
consist of naught but the vastly complex and undifferentiable 
mass which we call the Self. Presentation and Self will then _ 
fuse into one in the consciousness of the moment in which 
a field of attention fails to stand over against a field of 
inattention.
-P-A-G-E-60
  CHAPTER IV 
THE DISPARATENESS OF NOETIC EMPHASES OR 
PRESENTATIONS 
I 
Sec. 1. Turninc now from the study of the Self, 
and of its supposed simulacrum the empirical ego, let 
us consider the general nature of the presentations to 
the Self. 
All men in every day speech refer to various types of 
presentations ; ¢.g. sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc., 
which we may describe as disparate mental states, and 
which the plain man, if we may judge by his language, 
thinks of somewhat as though they were psychic atoms, 
as it were, definitely separable from one another. 
Sufficient explanation of this view, which was developed 
by the atomistic psychologists of the early association 
school, is doubtless found in the fact that we usually note 
the disparateness in the process of comparison of successive 
presentations; and there we really deal with revivals of 
states the originals of which are appreciated as having 
been separated from one another by the fact that they 
existed in clearly distinct moments. 
But if we consider the matter with a little care we 
perceive that we discover very numerous cases where this 
disparateness seems to appear at one and the same instant. 
As I write, the presentation of the moment involves certain
-P-A-G-E-61
    THE DISPARATENESS OF PRESENTATIONS 47 
sensational elements of taste connected with the fact that 
I have lately eaten some fruit, and also certain thought 
elements which are as far as possible removed in character 
from these sensational taste elements. It might be held 
that this effect is due to the rapidity of the flow of 
presentations ; that the taste of the fruit and the thoughts 
are really successive presentations, and not parts of a single 
complex presentation. But even if this claim were valid 
it is perfectly clear, in any event, that in the very usual 
process of comparison, which yields the notion of the 
disparateness we are here discussing, there exists a double- 
ness, and an opposition, within the very presentation of the 
moment of comparison. We cannot grasp the fact that 
a sensation is diverse from a thought unless we have both 
sensation and thought, or their “images” which we con- 
ceive to be very like them, both at once in one presentation. 
In order that we may gain a clear notion of the meaning 
of this disparateness of psychic forms let us for a moment 
consider what are the conditions in the neururgic situation 
corresponding with our appreciation of this presentative 
disparateness. 
Sec. 2. We have seen that the action of the whole 
nervous system in any one moment must be conceived of 
as one pulse of activity, an activity which however is 
variously evidenced in the several parts of the highly 
complex system, so that in any given moment the conditions 
of activity in the whole nervous system may be described 
as displaying a specific meururgic pattern. The nature of 
this neururgic pattern at any moment is determined by 
the degree of emphasis of certain activities in certain special 
parts of the whole vastly complex nervous system; and 
therefore what we often for convenience speak of as acti- 
vities in special parts of the nervous system, as though 
they stood in contrast with non-activities in other parts, 
should properly be described, as we have seen, merely as  
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN or 
emphases of activity in certain special parts of this vastly 
complex system of activities. 
But it will be agreed that these neururgic emphases are 
due, to a great extent at least, either to forces of varied 
nature which act as stimuli to the system from without 
itself in many different parts at the same time, or to 
resultants of such stimuli in times past. And beyond this, 
these stimuli which produce these emphases in diverse parts 
of the neururgic system vary in kind and in degree from 
moment to moment. It thus appears that each observable 
emphasis of activity in any special part of so vastly complex 
a system as the human nervous system, must necessarily 
be a complex emphasis,—an emphasis in which minor 
differences of emphasis appear. 
The very facts then which warrant our description of 
the condition of the nervous system at any moment as a 
specific neururgic pattern, involve the existence of a com- 
plexity of minor neururgic emphases within the major 
neururgic emphasis which gives the special character to the 
specific neururgic pattern: and this being true it seems 
clear that successive neururgic patterns when considered as 
wholes, and compared, must appear to be disparate if the 
major and minor neururgic emphases which give them their 
specific character occur in diverse parts of the nervous 
system, even though this disparateness be due merely to 
a shifting of position, so to speak, of emphases within the 
whole neururgic system. 
Sec. 3. If it is true that a thoroughgoing neururgic and 
noetic correspondence prevails, then as we have seen we may 
picture the condition of consciousness at any moment as 
displaying a specific noetic pattern; and evidently the very 
facts which warrant this descriptive term, involve the 
existence of a complexity of minor noetic emphases within 
the major noetic emphases which gives the special character 
to the noetic pattern of any given moment. This being
-P-A-G-E-63
    THE DISPARATENESS OF PRESENTATIONS 49 
true it is not difficult to comprehend how it happens that 
successive noetic patterns when considered as wholes, and 
compared, must appear to be disparate, if the major and 
minor emphases which give them their specific character are 
themselves diverse, even though this disparateness implies 
no more than a shifting of noetic emphases within the whole 
complex system which we describe as consciousness. 
II 
Sec. 4. It is evident that if we are correct in the view as 
above outlined a noetic emphasis may appear in any part of 
consciousness if we may so speak, even as a neururgic 
emphasis may appear in any part of the neururgic system ; 
and as each neururgic emphasis is sui generis, so each noetic 
emphasis must be sui generis. Clearly then there is no 
warrant for a notion that any particular emphasis in any 
particular minor noetic system within consciousness can by 
any stretch of language be called a copy of, or a residuum of, 
any other emphasis in any other minor noetic system ; 
although it may well be that one emphasis would not be 
what it is had not another emphasis in another minor noetic 
system previously appeared; and may well be that one 
emphasis may be a simulacrum of another emphasis in a 
minor noetic system other than that in which the former 
appears. There is no warrant, for instance, for the notion 
that the presentations or noetic emphases in the group of 
minor noetic systems which we have designated by B in 
Fig. 3 (Chapter 1. Sec. 3), are copies or residua of noetic 
emphases in the group of minor noetic systems designated 
by A}; no warrant in other words for the view that our 
images and ideas (B) are copies or residua of sensations (A) 
or of any other presentations whatever. The most that can 
be said of these images and ideas is that they would not 
arise but for the previous appearance of these sensations or 
D
-P-A-G-E-64
    50 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
other presentations, and that in certain cases they are in a 
sense simulacra of these other forms of presentation. This 
view of course stands in opposition to the doctrines upheld 
by the association psychologists of the past generation, and 
cannot be adopted without a more careful examination to 
which we return later. 
Il 
Sec. 5. Our conception of consciousness as a system of 
minor psychic systems of different grades of complexity, and 
differently integrated, enables us to see how we are able to 
group disparate presentations in various ways according as 
they are more or less closely related, notwithstanding the 
fact that each noetic emphasis or presentation is sui generis. 
We have made such a broad grouping in Chapter 1. Sec. 4 
(confer Fig. 3, Chapter 11. Sec. 3) into (A) presentations 
which relate to the stimulation of the organism from its 
environment, viz. our sensations ; (I’) presentations which 
relate to the reaction of the organism upon its environment, 
viz. our instinct experiences and emotions, etc., and (B) 
presentations which are coordinative of classes (A) and (I), 
viz. our images, ideas, thoughts, etc. We have seen also 
that we find minor groups within each of these larger 
groups ; in the realm of sensations (A), light, sound, etc. ; 
in the realm of reaction (I'), the numerous variety of our 
instinct experiences and emotions, fear, love, etc.; and in 
the coordinative realm (B), the very broad variety of images, 
ideas and thoughts. To these we may add the important 
sub-class under (B) ; presentations which we may describe as 
inhibitive states; desire, impulse, etc.: and the sub-class 
under (I); presentations which relate to the resolution of 
these inhibitions; viz. our volitional acts: and a further 
sub-class under (B); presentations which are usually de- 
scribed as “ feelings of relation,” but which I prefer to call 
senses of relation.
-P-A-G-E-65
THE DISPARATENESS OF PRESENTATIONS 51 
Sec. 6. To certain important considerations in relation to 
the presentations within these several classes I refer at some 
length in Appendix A. Of the last mentioned class, viz. 
our “senses of relation,” it seems best to say a few words 
at this juncture. 
We have pictured the complex neururgic and _noetic 
emphases as producing in each moment a neururgic and a 
corresponding noetic pattern. But evidently at certain 
moments diverse patterns may arise, and these may be 
related the one with the other ; and these relations in them- 
selves will involve emphases of a special type in certain 
parts of the whole active system; and to these special 
relational emphases must correspond clearly definite pre- 
sentations. 
It is as though we were watching the surface of the sea, 
on which appear two patterns, one due to yesterday’s storm, 
the other due to the swell produced by the displacement of 
a passing steamer. We here note that the separate big 
waves of the two patterns, which cross each other, produce 
in this very crossing a special new set of wave forms. 
These special wave forms are symbolic of what must happen 
when diverse neururgic patterns co-exist : then special minor 
patterns must run through and across the diverse major 
patterns, just because these patterns touch, and cross, and 
combine with each other. 
We should then expect to note within consciousness these 
same characteristics, and should expect to experience special 
forms of presentations in correspondence with the neururgic 
emphases involved with these combinational forms. These 
we have in our “senses of relation.” Such for example 
are the presentations we have in mind when we speak of 
two things being equal, or of one being greater than the 
other, or of one being above another, or of one being 
between two things, or of two things being different or 
alike.
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
There are an innumerable number of such relational pre- 
sentations which we all recognize: but we must go far 
beyond the recognition of such very distinct senses of 
relation as those just mentioned, and acknowledge that 
many others exist which we do not think of so clearly. As 
Prof. James says ;1 “we ought to say a feeling of and, a 
feeling of if, a feeling of but, and a feeling of dy; quite as 
readily as we say a feeling of biue, or a feeling of cold.” 
Of these senses of relation, it is to be noted that they 
appear in connection with, as bound up with, the most 
diverse of other presentations. Such diverse objects as 
brooms and mountains may be spoken of as unequal in 
size. A bull terrier may be thought of as between two 
masses of color on a rug; or again as between a bull dog 
and a terrier. The “feeling of if” may exist in countless 
connections. But for all that, these senses of relation are 
just as much special presentations as are cats or colors, or 
emotions, or thoughts. They are special noetic forms which 
may, and can only, appear in connection with other, and 
sometimes many other, presentations. 
To these senses of relation we shall refer frequently in 
what follows.

  CHAPTER V 
THE MUTABILITY OF NOETIC EMPHASES OR 
PRESENTATIONS 
I. Eacu Noetic Parrern anp zacu Noetic Empunasis Is 
New ano Unigue 
Sec. 1. We have laid aside the common notion of the 
existence of masses of atom-like diverse presentations, and 
have explained our experience of the disparateness of pre- 
sentations in terms of the emphasis of disparate parts within 
the whole of consciousness. But in so doing we must not 
allow ourselves to cling to the notion that these disparate 
parts within this whole of consciousness are fixed and immu- 
table in their nature. On the contrary, it is important to 
note that in their very nature the presentation to each Self 
in each moment is necessarily new and unique, and part of 
a new and unique noetic pattern. This doctrine is one 
which will not be unfamiliar to students of modern psycho- 
logy, but in the opinion of the writer the implications of the 
doctrine in relation to psychology and philosophy are not 
usually thoroughly appreciated. 
Mr. Shadworth H. Hodgson in his Metaphysic of Experi- 
ence} tells us that in his view “it is a mere common blunder, 
caused by looseness of common sense thought, to suppose 
that one and the same experience is ever recalled or 
repeated. A numerical identity of two experiences, one 
1Vol. i, p. 166.
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
past and the other present, is a self-contradiction : an event 
of any kind once gone is gone for ever. But neither is 
their identity in point of content complete. Similarity of 
content between two or more experiences, so great as to 
render them indistinguishable except by the place, which, 
owing to their context, they are perceived to occupy in 
a single series of experiences, is the utmost that can be meant 
by calling them identical.” 
Prof. Wm. James also in his Psychology? tells us that “no 
state once gone, can recur and be identical with what it was 
before.” ‘Every thought we have of a given fact is, 
strictly speaking, unique, and only bears a resemblance of 
kind with our other thoughts of the same fact. When the 
identical fact recurs, we must think of it in a fresh manner, 
see it under a somewhat different angle, apprehend it in 
different relations from those in which it last appeared.” 
If the positions taken in previous chapters are to be main- 
tained, it will be evident to the reader that, if we accept this 
position in relation to presentations to the Self, we must go 
even further and say that each moment of the totality of 
conscious experience, is a new totality of conscious experience : 
i.e. that both the Self and the presentations to the Self of 
each moment are respectively a new Self, and a new pre- 
sentation. It will be best, however, in this connection to 
limit our considerations to this characteristic as it is displayed 
in presentations, which alone are observable in reflection; 
reserving for Book 111. a study of the implications of this 
doctrine in relation to the Self. 
Sec. 2. Turning from introspection, we may consider for 
a moment the objective evidence in favor of this view, in 
connection with the hypothesis of correspondence between 
neural and mental phases which we are here assuming. 
Under this hypothesis each elementary psychic activity, as 
it is unusually spoken of,—each partial emphasis in the whole 
1Vol. i, p. 230 ff. Confer also Royce, Outlines of Psychology, p. 199.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 55 
pulse of the psychic activity of the moment,—corresponds 
with a like elemental neural activity,—a like partial emphasis, 
—in the whole pulse of neural activity of the self-same 
moment. The question before us here is whether we can 
conceive of any two successive pulses of neural activity in 
the same organism as ever being exactly reduplicated, and 
to that question I think we are compelled to give a negative 
answer: an answer which is of importance because, if the 
hypothesis of neururgic and noetic correspondence is war- 
ranted, then it must be that each presentation in each 
moment must be a new and unique presentation. 
Even within inorganic matter of a relative simplicity of 
constitution it is very difficult for us to conceive of exact 
recurrences of form and conditions in successive moments : 
and as a matter of fact we usually tacitly agree that each bit 
of inorganic matter is necessarily really a different bit of 
matter, and not the same, before and after it has received 
and has reacted to a physical impulse of any kind from its 
environment. It is possible for the physicist who assumes 
the indestructibility of physical atoms to hold that a given 
atom, or a given molecule formed of atoms, may in two 
different moments be one and the same in all respects and 
under all conditions ; although it is to be noted that he is 
unable to prove his assertion empirically, and is some- 
what hesitant now-a-days in his defense of the validity 
of this conception. But as the constitution of inorganic 
matter for the moment under consideration becomes more 
and more complex, the return to its original condition after 
a reaction of any kind becomes more and more unlikely ; 
for the reason that the primary reaction then involves a 
readjustment of many relations ; and a return to its original 
condition involves a physical impulse, or series of impulses, 
which shall restore all of these many relations at once. Thus 
the evaporation of water from a body of sand leaves it dry, 
and free to be blown by the wind out of its original position;
-P-A-G-E-70
  56 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
and the shifting sand may divert the course of some little 
streamlet, which in its turn may cause many changes in the 
surface of the ground. To replace all of these changed parts 
of the comparatively simple inorganic masses which are here 
considered would evidently be impossible without a very 
complex set of conditions which are not likely to occur 
in conjunction. 
When we turn to the consideration of living matter we 
find the conditions of complexity immensely increased ; and 
the nervous system of man is a kind of living matter of an 
extraordinarily complex nature, and with its parts bound 
together, as we have seen, in a system of immensely complex 
systems. In such a piece of living matter any special 
reaction in any part, however small it be, to any physical 
impulse whatever, must disturb an immense number of 
relations which can only be restored by a very special set 
of physical impulses bearing an inherent relation of enormous 
complexity; and the probability of the appearance of such a 
special set of physical impulses is evidently so exceedingly 
small that it may be overlooked. 
Sec. 3. But here it must be observed that the very 
characteristic that attracts our attention in relation to living 
matter in comparison with non-living matter is this; that 
while on the one hand complex inorganic masses after 
reaction to a physical impulse do not often even appear to 
regain their original form, on the other hand complex organic 
masses after reaction to a physical impulse do seem to regain 
the form which appeared before the reaction, and this by 
processes which seem to be inherent in themselves, and not 
determined by the occurrence of new impulses in their 
environment. 
But in consideration of the facts above presented we find 
it very difficult to see how this recovery of its first condition 
can really be entirely complete, and we are led to suspect 
that although the nature of living matter is such that it itself 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 57 
tends to produce, after a reaction, what appears to us to 
be a recurrence of its condition as it existed before the 
reaction, nevertheless this recurrence can never be exact ; 
and that therefore this appearance of identity must neces- 
sarily be due to an illusion determined by our weakness of 
observation, or to carelessness of thought. The evidence 
that recovery of its first condition after a reaction is never 
exactly complete lies in the fact that living matter, more or 
less gradually, but none the less surely, changes in form and 
in structure, as is seen in the fact that it grows old and 
finally dies. We are led therefore to assume that some 
slight, even if it be unobservable, change is made in the 
structure of each bit of living matter, and in the relation of 
its parts, in connection with each of its reactions ; so that in 
reality after each reaction it no longer remains the same bit 
of living matter, capable of becoming what it was before its 
reaction ; but rather that after each reaction, however slight, 
it becomes a new bit of living matter." 
If this is true of organic matter in general it must hold 
especially in reference to the highly complex nervous system 
as a whole.” 
1 According to the modern doctrines of evolution, as expressed by its most 
noted expositors, heredity, which is supposed to involve the recurrence of 
fixed forms in successive generations, has been assumed to be fundamental, 
while variation has been assumed to be occasional and due to special adapta- 
tion to environmental influences. This assumption has not until lately been 
subjected to critical examination, because it has been unimportant to the 
development of the evolutionary theory whether it is true, or whether it is 
more correct to assume that variation is fundamental, and that what we call 
recurrence of fixed forms through heredity is an appearance due to the 
adaptation to relatively stable environmental influences. 
It is interesting in this connection to note that the latter assumption is 
now being upheld by certain careful students of organic development.

Sec. 4. Now if all this be true, then it must be that each 
neururgic pattern and each neururgic emphasis must be new 
and unique. | Then also it is evidently true, as we have 
already seen is acknowledged by those who carefully record 
their introspective experiences, that each corresponding 
noetic pattern is in itself a new noetic pattern; notwith- 
standing that the differences between successive noetic 
patterns in the same person may altogether escape our 
observation. And beyond this we must hold that each 
psychic emphasis within each noetic pattern must be new 
and unique, although there will be many cases where 
successive emphases as reviewed in reflection will appear to 
be unchanged.1 
senile by others which are new-born, if we may so speak, and therefore 
more vigorous, and which may take up the work which the dying cells are 
laying down. There is evidence, which is seen in all complex organisms 
taken as wholes, that these new cells do come into being in the process of 
growth, and that they do die in the process of senile decay. ‘That this 
process does go on in a general way during the life of the organism as a 
whole seems to be evidenced in the observable repair of the so-called vulgar 
tissues, and of the superficial parts of the body ; and it probably could be 
traced, had we proper means of observation, in the more delicate cell parts 
of the nervous system in which we are here especially interested. This 
latter point is however problematical. 
Under such an hypothesis of substitution it appears at first sight that we 
might conceive of readjustment which would enable the complex organic 
system to retain a structure capable of reacting again to a stimulus exactly 
as it did after the primary reaction, so that it could not then be said that in 
all cases the system at the time of each reaction was structurally a new 
system. But even this supposition does not prove to suffice one who would 
make such a claim ; for it must be remembered that each new-born cell is 
a cell of a longer line of inheritance than those from which it derives its 
life ; and that the influences which give it its special structure must there- 
fore in some indefinitely small measure differ from those which have 
influenced those cells from which it is derived. 
1 For instance ; each of the general qualities of which we speak at length 
in Book 1, when appreciated as such, involves the appearance of a specific 
psychic emphasis, and this can never be appreciated in reflection as changing

  THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 59 
Sec. 5. It is well here to note that although each pre- 
sentation as experienced is a new and unique presentation, 
nevertheless it is what it is because there were others before 
it; the noetic pattern of any moment is what we may speak 
of as the development of the previously existing noetic 
pattern, as this is modified, not only by the natural failure 
of partial emphases within the earlier total emphasis within 
consciousness as it then existed, but also by newly accruing 
partial emphases. It would thus appear that each partial 
emphasis within the total complex emphasis which we 
describe as the presentation of any special moment must 
have its resultant in the total complex presentation of the 
next moment. This turns our attention to another point. 
Sec. 6. We are evidently dealing here with what is 
commonly called retentiveness which as Dr. Ward says?’ is 
both a biological and a psychological fact. 
If we suppose the existence of an isolated living neural 
element we may think of it as being aroused to a higher 
degree of activity by some action upon it from its environ- 
ment. In the fact that it reacts it becomes in some measure 
modified in form, and this modification involves its becoming 
in reality a type of neural element different from that which 
received the impulse from its environment. In this respect 
our neural element is like all other physical objects; and 
this fact involves what may be described broadly as neural 
retentiveness. 
from moment to moment: intensity and pleasure for instance as intensity 
and as pleasure always appear to be respectively the same. Nevertheless we 
must hold that even these general qualities are never fully and absolutely 
the same in successive moments, and that they change their character very 
gradually during life as it developes. What we mean by speaking of them 
as general qualities is not that they are identically the same when appreci- 
ated in connection with diverse successive more complex presentations, but 
that in any given moment they might be appreciated in connection with 
any given presentation were the proper conditions fulfilled.

-P-A-G-E-74
60 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
But this retentiveness gains a new significance when this 
neural element becomes one of a large number of elements 
bound together in a system. Then the retentiveness of the 
element is liable to be masked by broader activities due to the 
complexity of the system of which it is a subordinate part. 
The system as a whole reacts upon the element as thus 
modified, and this is not unlikely at times to reduce the import 
of this modification of the element. The neururgic pattern 
of the whole system, of the moment in question, may be so 
effective that we may lose sight of the modification of the 
element ; and in fact the element thus modified may actually 
be cut out of the great system by the fact that its modifica- 
tion is incompatible with what appears as a persistent form 
of the neururgic pattern. 
It is only because this retentiveness is masked by the very 
complexity of the activities in the system as a whole that we 
come to look upon it as a special characteristic of living 
matter in general, and of nervous matter in particular, that 
after a reaction which involves a change of form it appears 
often to regain the form which existed before the change, so 
that it apparently again becomes capable of reacting exactly 
as it reacted before. 
Sec. 7. This fact that retentiveness is a general 
characteristic of nervous matter, which is easy to accept 
on its physiological side, gains great importance when we 
consider its psychical correspondent. For we are led thus 
to see that each modification of any individual conscious- 
ness must leave a permanent effect upon the whole psychic 
system which can never be obliterated, and which must 
effect all future a which are given in the individual’s 
consciousness. Not only will the elementary noetic forms 
as such be thus changed, but complex systemic changes 
will occur wick will alter the nature of the whole 
“psychical disposition.” 
This fact again is masked by the complexity of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 61 
whole conscious ‘system. Noetic patterns which appear 
today will seem to recur again at later times; but here 
again we are evidently led astray by an illusion. The 
second noetic pattern may be what we in practical life 
call “just the same as” the first one; but those who 
have followed our argument above will realize that such 
cannot actually be the case. The fact that habitual 
exercise involves gradual changes in the nature of the 
related presentations itself suffices to show that the re- 
currence cannot involve the repetition of exactly the same 
presentation.’

Sec. 8. But it will occur to some reader that this view 
that each moment’s presentation is new and unique seems 
on its face inconsistent with that form of introspection 
which leads us to speak of certain successive presentations 
as more or less unlike, as more or less alike, or even 
as exactly the same. Let us enquire therefore as to the 
nature of this sense of likeness, which when markedly 
developed, leads us to assert this sameness. 
When we consider with care the marked distinctions 
which are noted in the nature of our presentations it 
becomes clear that what we know as this disparateness 
1Dr. James Ward says on the page cited above ‘the whole field of 
consciousness would thus, like a continually growing picture, increase 
indefinitely in complexity of pattern; the earlier presentations not dis- 
appearing, like the waves of yesterday in the calm of today, but rather 
lasting on, like old scars that show beneath new ones.” This illustration 
seems to me to be misleading. We may be able to picture to ourselves 
the old scar because our attention is given to certain aspects of the new 
scar. But in fact the old scar has disappeared in the formation of the 
new one. All that we can properly say is that the new scar would not 
be what it is but for the previous existence of the old scar. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
    62 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
between presentations is a matter of degree: some pairs 
of presentations appear more unlike than others; some so 
little unlike that while we distinguish them we nevertheless 
speak of them as alike. For instance we can just dis- 
tinguish two shades of blue which we say are very much 
alike: it is easier to distinguish blue from red; easier 
still to distinguish sensations as a whole, from thoughts, 
CLG, <CtG. 
When we say that two objects or experiences are alike, or 
that they are different, we are engaged in the process which 
we describe as comparison ; and in the act of comparison we 
are experiencing a special one of those “senses of relation” 
of which we have spoken at the close of the preceding 
chapter. When the “sense of difference” is distinctly 
marked, the “sense of likeness” is lacking: but as the 
“sense of difference’? becomes less clear, the ‘“‘sense of 
likeness” becomes more prominent. 
It is true that in our description of a case of comparison 
we usually speak as though, taking presentations A and B, 
we in some way brought them together, laid one on the 
other, and saw how far they corresponded and how far one 
over-lapped the other. But a little thought will of course 
convince us that nothing of the kind happens in con- 
sciousness when we compare. We generally assume that 
the process in comparison is that just described merely 
because in practical life we experience the ‘sense of 
likeness” or the “sense of difference” most distinctly 
when we do bring objects in the outer world together 
somewhat in the manner described above. 
‘When we make a comparison between A and B we do 
not find in consciousness A, and then B; nor even A and 
1Cf. James, ° Psychology, i. 4933 also J. S. Mill (Note p. 54, vol. ii. 
of his edition of Jas. Mill’s Axalysis). Likeness and unlikeness are 
“properties of our simple feelings which must be postulated as ultimate, 
and which are inseparable from the feelings themselves.” : 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 63 
B as separated items in mere conjunction; rather do we find 
a special form of complex presentation which involves both 
A and B, and also a special “sense of relation.” In other 
words there occurs, in all cases of comparison, a certain 
complex form of noetic emphasis in which three secondary 
emphases appear. There is partial presentation A (say this 
yellow ball), and partial presentation B (say this orange) ; 
and partial presentation C which consists of this sense of 
likeness or difference, as determined by the existence of A 
and B, yet as diverse from each of them. 
Sec. 9. It is true that a bond of identity must always 
exist between the two disparate partial presentations A and 
B which are compared; which if true means that A and B 
have common elements which are fused and which are 
themselves not disparate. Under such a view we would 
hold that when these identities are relatively very few 
we gain a “sense of difference”; and that when they 
are very many we gain a “sense of likeness.” 
The correctness of this view is vouched for if we examine 
a case of close likeness. If, for instance, I cut a strip of 
blue paper into two pieces and lay the two parts side by side 
I am likely to say that the color of each of the two pieces is 
exactly alike. Here evidently the presentation is one of 
double emphasis at least, for we recognize that there are two 
pieces of paper, the distinction between the two being due to 
differences of many kinds of which we need not speak. But 
the color blue seems identical in the two cases, or as much 
so as is ever possible in any case: and this is clearly due to 
the fact that similar sense terminals, and their related 
parts, are called into activity by the impression from each of 
the bits of blue paper. The basis of likeness is of course 
seldom so clearly marked as in the case above considered : 
for we often experience the sense of fairly close likeness in 
some cases where we cannot by any objective study, or by 
any introspection, discover the bond of unity in the identity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Nevertheless the cases are so many where we can trace the 
bond of identity that we are warranted in claiming without 
hesitation that they always exist when a likeness is 
recognized. 
Where the likeness is very marked we are likely to speak 
of the two separable elements of the presentation as identical 
and the same. But it is clear that we are thus using our terms 
most carelessly ; for strictly speaking the two parts cannot 
be the same and identical unless complete fusion of the two 
parts into one takes place, in which case there could be no 
recognition of doubleness, but merely a higher emphasis of a 
presentation which would be regarded as single; and it there- 
fore appears that what we recognize as sameness between 
two parts of a complex presentation must be really merely a 
very high degree of likeness.1 
It is apparent therefore that this likeness may be of many 
grades, varying all the way from what we usually call same- 
ness, to thoroughly close likeness, and less close likeness, 
and distinct unlikeness, until we reach what we call complete 
disparateness which yields the “ sense of difference.” 
Sec. 10. Turning now to cases of marked disparateness, 
it seems clear that here also the presentations are always 
noetic emphases in which at least three minor emphases 
appear. In one and the same noetic pattern we have partial 
presentations A and B which are brought together and 
compared, and the mark of their comparison lies in the 
existence of another partial presentation C, which is a special 
“« sense of relation,” that leads us to say A and B are unlike. 
It is not always evident however in such cases that a bond 
of identity exists between the two partial presentations A 
and B. Nevertheless, even where the two parts of the 
complex presentation which are compared appear most 
thoroughly disparate, it is evident that some bond of unity

University of Pennsylvania, 1—April, 1890—especially pp. 64 ff.
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 65 
must exist whatever it may be: for as Dr. Jas. Ward says? 
“absolute difference,—or disparateness as we may call it,— 
affords no ground for relations ;” this becoming evident 
“when we consider (1) that, if we had only a plurality of 
absolutely different presentations, we should have no con- 
sciousness at all; and (2) that we can never compare, 
although we distinguish, i.e. recognize numerical difference, 
—where presentations seem absolutely or totally different.” 
How these bonds of identity may exist without being 
observable will become more comprehensible in connection 
with the discussions of the following division of this chapter, 
where we shall see that in all probability with each primary 
presentation there exists also a secondary presentation which 
is so overwhelmed by the primary presentation that the 
secondary presentation cannot be recognized in reflection. 
If such overlooked secondary presentations do exist with all 
primary presentations, then it is not difficult to imagine that 
the bond of identity between what appear in reflection to be 
utterly different partial presentations may at times lie, not in 
the primary presentations of the sensational-perceptual order 
as they often do, but in secondary presentations which are so 
overwhelmed that they are not observable in reflection. 
Moreover in some cases the bond of identity may be 
surmised to lie in elementary parts that can never under 
any circumstances be held apart as distinct presentations in 
attention. For, as we have already seen, the nature of each 
psychic emphasis is determined partly by influences from 
within the field of inattention ; and it may well be that in 
this field of inattention, which is always unobservable in 
reflection, may often lie the psychic elements which are 
identical to two parts of a complex presentation which are 
differentiated and compared. We may truly say then that 
the senses of likeness and of unlikeness are determined by 
the appreciation of identities of some degree : but it is to be

especially noted that these identities exist in the presentation 
of the moment of comparison; a point which we shall find 
significant in what follows. 
III. “ Representation.” 
Sec. 11. In the discussions of the previous sections we 
have passed over one fact which seems at first sight to 
stand in opposition to the view that each presentation of 
each moment is a new and unique presentation; viz. the 
fact that we constantly speak, not only in every day con- 
versation, but also in careful psychological discussion, of 
the existence of representations. This term is used as 
though it were a matter of common agreement that the 
mental states referred to are not in each case new pre- 
sentations, but are duplications of former presentations of 
which we have an unchanged record;—a record with which 
we compare the so-called representations, and with which we 
in a measure identify them. Nor is this merely a matter 
of the careless use of words, It is clear that the founders 
and earlier expounders of the association psychology tacitly 
assumed such permanence of presentations, and that the 
Herbartians did so explicitly. If our contention is valid 
we are then called upon to explain the nature of these 
so-called representations as a certain type of new and 
unique presentations. 
This question is au fond the same as that raised above 
where we noted that the associationists must be in error 
in holding that images and ideas are of a sensational type, 
being copies in some sense of real sensational experiences, 
or developments of such copies. It will be well then to 
begin our study of the special problem before us with a 
consideration of the general nature of images and ideas as 
these are distinguished from sensational impressions.

THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 67 
  A. Of Primary and Secondary Presentations. 
Sec. 12. James Mill opens the second chapter of his 
Analysis with the following words : “The sensations which 
we have through the medium of the senses exist only by 
the presence of the object and cease upon its absence.” 
«When our sensations cease, by the absence of their objects 
—something remains,” ... “It is not the sensation, but 
something different from the sensation, yet more like the 
sensation than anything else can be; so like that you call 
it a copy, an image, of the sensation, sometimes a repre- 
sentation or trace of the sensation.” ‘Another name for 
this is Idea.” Mill thus clearly makes a broad distinction 
between Impressions or Sensations on the one hand, and 
Images or Ideas on the other ; and he does not hesitate to 
state that the latter are in some sense copies of the former. 
This is a view which has been held by many psychologists 
in the past without any thoroughly critical examination ; 
and it is one which is subscribed to, although somewhat 
hesitatingly, by not a few psychologists to the present day. 
Hume it will be remembered held that the difference 
referred to was based upon a mere difference of intensity. 
And William James when writing his larger Psychology still 
clung to the same view,’ although he acknowledged other, 
1Cf. vol. ii. p. 72, last paragraph. Even Prof. G. F. Stout (Manual 
of Psychology, pp. 398 and 399) tells us that “we ought to hesitate before 
discarding a distinction generally accepted both by psychology and common 
sense.” But he goes on to say; “On the other hand, if we accept it, 
we must mean by vividness something different from those degrees of 
sensible quality which may be equally present in the sensible quality as 
actually perceived and as mentally reproduced. What is’ this vividness ? 
The answer seems to be contained in Hume’s words. According to him 
the distinctive characteristic of percepts as compared with images is the 
force and liveliness with which they strike the mind. This ‘striking 
the mind’ is the essential point. At bottom the difference is a differ- 
ence of quality, not of degree. Images do not strike the mind in the 
same way as percepts.”
-P-A-G-E-82
68 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
  but for him less important, marks of difference. But it 
seems clear that we must abandon this view which in the 
opinion of Dr. Jas. Ward, was effectually disposed of by 
Reid and by Lotze, and which Dr. Ward? has himselt 
certainly shown to be untenable. As Sully? says, “It is 
evident that this”’ (difference of intensity) ‘‘is not the whole 
of it; otherwise we should confuse weak and_ indistinct 
impressions (e.g. those. of faint sound, or of indistinctly 
seen objects) with images”: and this we do not find our- 
selves doing. 
Sec. 13. It is not difficult to understand how this notion 
that images and ideas are copies of sensational impressions 
arose in the minds of the early observers of psychic states 
as such. The naive observer cannot fail to notice certain 
cases where the psychic correspondents of direct impressions 
upon his body from without seem almost identical with 
psychic states which are clearly not correspondent with such 
direct impressions. If in one moment he experiences the 
vivid impression due to his looking at a star, and in a 
second moment closes his eyes, his experience in the second 
moment will usually be what Fechner would have called 
a “memory after image” of the star, or what modern 
psychologists * are wont to call a “ primary-memory-image,” 
which is evidently very like the psychic correspondent of 
the impression when his eyes were open. 
Occasionally he notices what we call ‘after images”’ ; 
and these, when he notes them, are closely related to the 
primary-memory-images just mentioned. Even when these 
after images are not noticed the immediately subsequent 
thoughts of these primary-memory-images are presentations 
which are evidently closely allied with the original primary-

THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 69 
memory-images which seemed, when he experienced them, 
to be so nearly identical with the original vivid impres- 
sions. But such a “thought” is a presentation which he 
is wont to speak of as an “idea’’ rather than as an image ; 
and when.a similar thought recurs the next day it is 
clearly a very ordinary kind of “idea,” yet is looked upon 
as practically the same as the “idea” of the day before, 
which was so closely connected with the original presenta- 
tion coincident with an impression upon him from without 
that he then called it an image or copy of this original 
presentation. 
While these considerations serve to explain how it happens 
that the naive psychologist is led to think of what we call 
images and ideas as in a sense copies of original impressions, 
they also show that the basis of this conception is not gained 
as the result of very critical analysis, and that we ought not 
to content ourselves with the acceptance of such a view 
without full warrant. 
Sec. 14. It appears to the writer that much light is 
thrown upon the nature of the presentations above described 
by the consideration of the nature of the coincident 
activities in the nervous system: and in this connection 
I shall ask the reader to recur to the diagram with 
which he has become by this time so familiar that I shall 
not be compelled to describe it in detail (see Chapter 111.). 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-84
70 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
When our nervous system receives a stimulus from the 
environment through one of the sensory organs we may 
suppose the emphatic activities resulting from the stimula- 
tion to be symbolized by the darkened portions of the 
diagram (Fig. 6). These activities as a whole we may well 
call primary reactions. The principal emphasis of activities is 
seen in the parts directly acted upon by the environmental 
stimuli; but the main system is also involved to some 
extent in the total primary reaction. 
Now it is quite conceivable that the parts of the main 
System thus emphatically active in connection with the 
primary action may, under other conditions, become em- 
phatically active quite apart from any emphasis of activity 
in the parts directly related to the environment. In other 
words we ought to expect to experience conditions repre- 
sented by Fig. 7 below, which we may well call secondary 
reactions. 
  
  It is clear that it would be absurd for us to describe the 
neururgic pattern symbolized in Fig. 7 as a copy, or repro- 
duction, of that symbolized in Fig. 6. Primary reactions 
involve secondary reactions; but secondary reactions do not neces- 
sarily involve primary reactions. In no sense can secondary 
reactions be said to be copies of primary reactions. 
Sec. 15. When I perceive my friend before me, I may 
represent the emphatic coincident activities of my nervous

  THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 71 
system by the darkened circies in Fig. 6. There is the 
heightened activity in the sensory minor system Q, and this 
heightened activity spreads away into heightened activities 
in the closely related parts of the nervous system. The 
presentation in this case we may well call a primary pre- 
sentation. 
But when I have today the so-called image of the face of 
my friend whom I saw yesterday, the emphatic activities in 
the nervous system may be symbolized by the darkened 
portions in Fig. 7. In such cases the presentations may 
therefore properly be called secondary presentations But it 
is clear from our observation above referred to that these 
images just mentioned do not differ fundamentally from 
presentations which arise as coincident with neural acti- 
vities less closely related to the activities of the sense 
organs. 
The term idea, now-a-days, is more usually applied to 
those secondary presentations which are very indirectly 
related to primary presentations ; and, taking a step further, 
to those to which no primary presentation could ever have 
corresponded, to which we refer more particularly elsewhere. 
Mr. Bradley’ for instance would appear ready to use the 
term idea to cover images, presentations which are recog- 
nizedly connected with images, and finally those which 
are not so connected ; and it must not be forgotten that the 
earlier English psychologists employed the word idea in this 
same very broad way: eg. Hobbes, and Browne, and 
Locke ; the last of whom uses it ‘‘ to stand for whatsoever 
is the object of the understanding when a man thinks.” 
1 It is to be noted that Jas. Mill-speaks at times of ‘‘ ideas” as “secondary 
feelings.” 
2 Confer Mind, N.S. 40, p. 441. In opposition to the view “that, in 
order to have something ideal which qualifies an object, we must have an 
image or images existing separate or at least separable from that object ;” 
Mr. Bradley holds that “this identification of the ideal with images is surely 
a mistake,”
-P-A-G-E-86
  72 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
These differences of usage are apt to produce confusion 
in one’s mind, and for this reason I shall use the term 
secondary presentations to refer to all presentations which 
are not distinctly impressional. Secondary presentations 
may be of various grades of relationship to primary pre- 
sentations ; and the phrase may thus be extended to cover 
all of our images and ideas. “After images” are thus second- 
ary presentations which are so closely related to primary 
presentations that they may perhaps be not improperly 
spoken of as impressional.' 
With this meaning of the term secondary presentations 
before us, I wish here, in correspondence with what was said 
above in the paragraph following Fig. 7, to make the point 
that we clearly have no warrant for describing the noetic 
pattern symbolized in Fig. 7 as a copy, or reproduction, 
of that symbolized in Fig. 6. If we may judge from 
neurological evidence it would appear that primary presen- 
tations necessarily involve secondary presentations; but that 
secondary presentations do not necessarily involve primary pre- 
sentations. In no sense, if this view is correct, can a 
secondary presentation be said to be a copy of a primary 
presentation. 2 
Sec. 16. Before we consider the main question, let us 
examine the notion that a primary presentation always 
involves a secondary presentation. 
If I look at my inkstand I have a primary presentation. 
If I close my eyes I have a secondary presentation (an

“under the influence of a large dose of haschish I find myself totally unable 
to distinguish between what I. actually did and saw, and what I merely 
thought about” .. . “this shows that a revived impression is itself an 
impression, and not an idea.” A secondary presentation of one type, classed 
as impressional, is thus placed in contradistinction to a secondary presenta- 
tion of another type, classed as ideal.

vividness and clearness and definiteness, until finally it is 
no longer able to hold its own against other presentations 
which crowd in upon it." 
The primary presentation in this typical case may be 
represented by the symbol (1) Pl-2-3°4,5°6 ; in which the 
numbers symbolize the emphasized partial constituents of 
the complex primary presentation, and the marks ~_° ,* 
symbolize relations of any determinate character, which 
exist between these partial constituents. 
The secondary presentation which I experience when 
in the second moment I close my eyes may then be, 
in like manner, represented by the symbol (2) p! -2-3°4.5 ; 
the small p being used in place of the large P to indicate 
the evident difference of emphasis, or vividness as we say, 
between the primary and secondary presentations; the 
numbers, and symbols of relation, being retained to indicate 
the evident likeness of general nature existing between the 
primary and the secondary presentations; the number 6 
however being dropped, to indicate, what is equally evident, 
that some of the elements which appear in the primary 
presentations of one moment are lost in the corresponding 
secondary presentation of the following moment. 
If I keep my eyes closed, this secondary presentation 
changes in clearness and definiteness, and apart from com- 
1 Under the hypotheses adopted we assume that there is a constant 
tendency on the part of the mass of the stimulated neural system to absorb, 
so to speak, the special activities due to a complex stimulus reaching it; a 
constant tendency, in other words, to alteration of what we may call the 
amplitude of activity in the system as a whole, so that the activity of the 
partial minor system stimulated will no longer stand so fully in contrast 
from that of the system as a whole. 
In correspondence with these neural conditions we also assume a 
tendency on the part of the field of inattention to absorb the special 
presentation which appears as coincident with the special activity due to 
the reception of the stimulus; and thus gain an explanation of the fact 
here noted.
-P-A-G-E-88
74 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
    plications these changes appear to consist, largely at all 
events, in the dropping out of emphasis of some of the 
partial constituents of the secondary presentation symbolized 
by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, in the formula (2). If I keep 
my eyes closed for four successive units of time (which I 
speak of as moments) these images or secondary presenta- 
tions which I experience may then be symbolized as follows: 
(2) pl 2-3°405, 
(3) ph 2-3°4, 
(4) pt 2-3, 
(5) pire, 
The five presentations of these five successive moments, as 
usually considered, may therefore thus be symbolized as 
follows : 
(1) Bpi-2-3°4,5°6, Eyes open. 
(2) pl-2-3°4.5; Eyes closed. 
(3) pt2-3°4; Pree 
(4) pt 2-3; sea ins 
G2 oe 
This is what happens if after the first moment I close 
my eyes.’ But suppose that in the fourth moment I had 
opened my eyes, then I should have had a quite different 
experience. For then instead of secondary presentation 
pl2-3 I should have found myself experiencing a new 
primary presentation, of say my inkstand before me, very 
similar to the primary presentation of moment (1) and 
1For the sake of simplicity we here assume conditions which are 
seldom approximately, and never actually, realized ; as we shall see below.

which we may symbolize thus: (42) P1-2-3°4,5°6; this 
symbol differing from (1) only in the use of @ instead 
of a over the P. 
In the fifth moment, if I had kept my eyes open, instead 
of pr2 I should have experienced still another primary 
presentation of very similar form, which we may symbolize 
thus: (52) Pl-2-3°4,5°6, 
In order to make this point clearer let us place these 
symbols in direct conjunction.

Now we usually assume that in what we have described 
as the fourth and fifth moments, if my eyes are closed, 
I experience images, or secondary presentations, as per 
symbols 4 and 5: but that if in those same moments I 
open my eyes I experience primary presentations as per 
symbols 4a and 54 instead of secondary presentations 4 
and 5 which latter then cease to exist. But it appears 
highly improbable that such can really be the case, and 
much more probable that in the fourth moment, in case 
: oe I open my eyes, I have primary presentations P!~2-3°4.5"6 ; 
plus secondary presentation pi 2.3 which I would have ex- 
perienced alone had I kept my eyes closed. In fact it 
would seem probable that our common assumption, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  76 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
when I open my eyes pi 2-3 becomes non-existent, is 
entirely due to an illusion resulting from the fact that 
in subsequent reflection the vividness of the primary 
presentation p1-2.3°4,5"6 involves effects which entirely 
overwhelm the coincident secondary presentation pt 2-3, 
but do not obliterate it. 
Sec. 17. If we conclude that this suggestion is warranted 
then we surely are led to go even further than this, and 
to assume that with the primary presentation of moment (1) 
there also existed a secondary presentation, which we how- 
ever were unable to recognize in reflection because of the 
effects of the superior vividness of the primary presentation. 
In other words we must believe that in the first moment, 
with open eyes, we have not PI~2-3°4.5"6; but rather 
Pl-2-3°4,5%6 
pl-2-3°4.5*6 
and that in the second moment when we close our eyes we 
catch in g!~2-3°4.5, not the development of /1~2-3°4,5°6, 
but rather the development of pl 2-3°4.5°6, which was 
present with Pl-2_3°4,5*6 in the first moment, but over- 
whelmed by the effects of the superior vividness of the 
latter. If this is true then, if we assume the consciousness 
to be devoid of any emphases previous to moment (1), 
the true symbols representing the presentations of the 5 
successive moments noted in the right-hand column of 
“ Apparent Situations” in Sec. 16 will be as follows :

In other words it seems highly probable that with each 
primary presentation, occasioned by direct stimulation of our 
bodily organs from the environment, there goes also a 
secondary presentation or image, which latter however is 
overwhelmed by the effects of the superior vividness of the 
primary presentation. 
In our normal life, where a stimulus acts not merely 
for an indefinitely short time but is continuous for a suffi- 
cient time to act in relation with the rhythm of activity 
within the system, then in successive. moments we shall 
have, in the first place, a slight change in the reaction 
to the continuing stimulus from moment to moment due 
to the fact that the nature of the system is altered at each 
moment as the result of the reception of the stimulus; and 
1Confer my Pain, Pleasure and Aesthetics, p. 29. Confer also Shadworth 
H. Hodgson, Meraphysic of Experience, vol. iii. p. 28, where he says “A 
presented sensation begins to recede into the past of memory the very 
moment of its rising into consciousness, or appearing above the threshold. 
I do not say merely from the moment of its attaining its maximum of viyid- 
ness as a presentation, but from that of its rising into consciousness at all, 
prior, it may be, to its greatest vividness being reached. ‘This is saying in 
other words that representation is included as an inseparable element, or 
ingredient, in all presentations.”
-P-A-G-E-92
  78 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
this we may indicate by placing different Greek letters over 
the large P’s used in the symbols. In any three moments, 
therefore, under a perfectly continuous stimulation we shall 
have three primary presentations which, taking each for 
itself, we may present thus : 
Pl-2_3°4,5%6 
4. Tee pl 2-3°4.5%6 
Bi-2_3°4,5*6 GQ) ges pl-2-3°4.5%6 
pt-2_3°4,5*6 G3) aes pt-2-3°4,5%6 
But beyond this, in each successive moment after the 
first the primary presentation will be complicated by the 
development of the secondary presentations due to the effects 
of the preceding moments of stimulation. Consequently 
in the three successive moments we shall have forms of 
presentation which may be more properly symbolized as 
follows : 
a pt-2_3°4,5%6| 
pl 2-3°405™ | 
8 ° 
172_3°4,5%6 a z (2) {; vie | S338 pt 2-3°4.5%6 
Ss tor at 172_3°4,5"6 a (3) ‘ : piraug 4.53 p 2.34, 
pl 2-3°4.5°6 
Here the difference of Greek letter above the letters P 
indicates, as noted above, that in successive moments there 
is some difference in the successive primary presentations, 
small though it be. The capital letters indicate the parts
-P-A-G-E-93
  THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 79 
of the total presentations due to the stimulation of the 
moment, and which are recognized as the primary presenta- 
tions; while the small letters indicate the parts of the total 
presentation due in part to effects of previous stimulation, 
which constitute secondary presentations which are over- 
whelmed by the vividness of the several primary pre- 
sentations. 
Complicated as these formulae appear they will be recog- 
nized to be most artificially simplified for our special purpose. 
In fact the complexity of a noetic pattern, such as we have 
used as a simile in a previous chapter, gives a much closer 
suggestion of the real nature of the presentation of any 
moment. I present these formulae because in the final 
one (3) we have a symbol which we shall find useful later 
on ; for it is typical, as it pictures well the simplest form of 
a primary presentation which can be conceived to occur in 
our experience, and may be presumed to represent the 
general form of the much more complex primary presenta- 
tions we usually experience. 
Sec. 18. In speaking as I have above, of the primary 
presentations being always ‘accompanied” by secondary 
presentations, I have, for the sake of simplicity in exposition, 
used my words somewhat loosely. These so-called accom- 
panying secondary presentations must be in fact part and 
parcel of the whole complex presentation of the moment, 
into the complex mass of which both primary and secondary 
presentations are fused. What I wish to indicate is that 
certain parts of the primary presentation are eliminated 
where the presentation changes from a primary to a 
secondary presentation, or image; so that the secondary 
presentation, or image, appears as consisting only of the 
parts not thus eliminated. When, however, we come to 
consider the primary presentation in the analysis of reflec- 
tion, these parts of the primary presentation, which as 
developed go to make up the body of the secondary
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
presentation, are overwhelmed by the effects of the more 
emphatic elements directly related to impression upon us 
from without. 
B. Of “ Representation.” 
Sec. 19. Let us now return to the consideration of the 
view, that secondary presentations are in no sense copies of 
primary presentations. 
“‘Every moment of consciousness,” says Bosanquet,’ ‘is 
full of a given complex of presentation which passes away 
and can never be repeated without some difference. For 
this purpose, representation is just the same as a presenta- 
tion, is in fact a presentation.” The notion thus expressed 
is evidently utterly opposed to the view that images,— 
ideas,—“ representations,’—are in any way copies of .what 
I call primary presentations, but it is quite in accord with 
the view that each complex presentation as experienced is a 
new and unique presentation. Statements like this of 
Bosanquet’s pass without serious objection, and modern 
psychologists since James would hesitate to deny their 
truth : nevertheless, it seems clear that the implications jof 
this and similar statements are not realized by those who still 
persist in speaking of what I call secondary presentations 
as though they involved a reduplication of a previously 
experienced presentation. 
As a matter of fact, in ordinary life, when we are not 
concerned to expound any psychological doctrine, we practi- 
cally recognize that what we call representations are in no 
sense copies of what has gone before. In every day 
English speech we use the verb to “represent” with the 
meaning “to stand for” rather than with the meaning “to 
present again.” This is as if the common man had quite 
naively come to agree that when we speak of presenting 
again, we are really thinking inaccurately of a presentation 
1 Essentials of Logic, p. 74.
-P-A-G-E-95
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 81 
which merely stands for a presentation that has preceded the 
one under consideration; and that the notion that we ever 
do have actual re-presentations is an illusion. 
And at times recognition of this fact seems to be very 
explicit indeed. No one will claim, for instance, that the 
secondary presentation (the so-called re-presentation) of the 
face of his friend who died five years ago is in any way 
exactly the same thing as the secondary presentation to 
which he attached the same name the day after his friend’s 
death. We will agree that when considerable lapses of time 
are taken into account, these secondary presentations are so 
much changed as to be practically new at all events ; and we 
must likewise acknowledge that the change which is thus 
recognized must have been a gradual one. It is a marked 
one now that five years have passed away: it was just 
noticeable one year after the loss: it was unnoticeable a 
month after the death. 
At first sight it is likely to seem necessary to some reader 
to hold that we are here dealing with a continuing presenta- 
tion which has been losing attributes and connections as 
time has flown; for how else, it may be asked, can we 
know at all that the secondary presentation of a year ago has 
altered : if it appears to us to be the same in any respect it 
would seem that in some way we must hold a permanent 
somewhat ; otherwise comparison of the secondary presenta- 
tion, or revival, of one time could not be made with the 
secondary presentation of another time; indeed he may 
claim that in some manner the very original presentation 
remains with us to be compared with the miserable counter- 
part which we call the revival as it is today. 
1 Dr. James Ward, for instance, in an article published in the issue of 
Mind of October 1883 (p. 478), holds that revivability involves identifica- 
tion in which one thinks, this mental state (m 2) is identical with the state 
(m) which has been before presented to me ; and says “there seems but one 
way out of our difficulty, and that is to assume that after all the m was 
F 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
82 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Our previous consideration of the nature of comparison 
comes here to our aid, for it is clear that in the case above 
considered we are making comparison of two different 
secondary presentations in one complex presentation. 
It seems clear that we recognize as a fact that the 
““image” we have today of the face of our friend who died 
five years ago is very much less satisfactory than the 
“‘image”’ of his face we had a week after his burial, when 
we tried to recall his appearance. In such cases we have 
before us, (a) a secondary presentation “the face of our 
friend as it appeared five years ago as a secondary presenta- 
tion or image’; it is to be noted that this secondary 
presentation of this present moment is not at all the same 
as the secondary presentation, “the face of our friend” as it 
existed five years ago, although we carelessly speak of it as 
though it were. We have also before us (4) a secondary 
presentation “the face of our friend as it appears in 
memory today.” And beyond this we have before us today 
(c) the comparison of these two secondary presentations 
which are partial emphases in one more complex noetic 
emphasis ; in which comparison (a) “ the face of our friend 
as it appeared five years ago as a secondary presentation,” 
and (4) “the face of our friend as it appears in memory 
today ” are found different, and not at all alike. 
It is of course clear that this difference implies some sort 
of identity as the basis of the unity between these two 
continually presented but with a diminished and perhaps ever-diminishing 
intensity, and further, that at its so-called representation its intensity was 
sufficiently increased to enable it to rise above the threshold of consciousness 
and become a distinct object of attention.” 
But it is apparent upon more careful thought that such a position cannot 
be accepted unreservedly in the face of the fact that we recognize that what 
we have today is notably sot what we conceive that we had at the time 
of the death of our friend say five years ago. It is recognized to be but a 
mere unsatisfactory ghost of what we had in mind immediately after his 
death.
-P-A-G-E-97
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 83 
secondary presentations, as they are held together yet apart 
in the field of attention of the moment of comparison. But 
this identity is in the complex presentation of the moment, and can 
in no way be regarded as evidence of a permanent form of 
presentation which has persisted through all these five years, 
or indeed through any two successive moments. 
Sec. 20. In order that we may examine this specific 
process of comparison without the disturbance of a too 
cumbersome symbolization, let us agree to overlook the fact 
that secondary presentations inhere in primary presentations, 
and let us use the letter A to represent a given primary 
presentation. 
I look at my watch held in my hand, and I have (A) a 
primary presentation of the watch. When I put my watch 
in my pocket, I no longer have the primary presentation (A), 
but a complex secondary presentation, which at times takes 
the form which leads me to say that I have the “ repre- 
sentation” of the primary presentation “ the watch.” 
Now in such a case what I really have in attention in 
the second moment is a complex secondary presentation 
of triple emphasis in which two parts appear especially 
prominent. 
1. A partial secondary presentation which is commonly 
called the “representation of A,” and which I may designate 
by the symbol a. 
2. A partial secondary presentation which is what I call 
“what A was,” and which I may designate by the symbol 4. 
3. A sense of relation which leads me to say that a and A 
are alike. 
The primary presentation A no longer exists. What does 
exist is a dual secondary presentation ; viz. a (the so-called 
representation of A), and A (“what A was”), both within 
one complex secondary presentation. 
These two partial secondary presentations, a and J, I com- 
pare; and I think of a (the so-called representation of A)
-P-A-G-E-98
84 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
as so far like A (‘‘what A was”) that a is almost completely 
identified with A; and a (the so-called representation of A) 
is said to be almost exactly A (“‘ what A was”). 
It is evident here that we are dealing, in the first place, 
with the comparison of differents, and not with anything like 
identities. And it is clear, in the second place, that the a 
and the A with which we are dealing are widely different 
from A; for A was a primary presentation, while a and A 
are clearly secondary presentations. 
It is also clear that a and Q differ widely, although they 
are both parts of a complex secondary presentation ; for a 
(the so-called “representation” of the non-existent A) may 
be what we have above called a primary memory image, 
or a secondary presentation which seems to be almost 
primary in its character; or it may be removed just as far 
as possible from such a primary image: that is to say a may 
differ widely in its character of nearness and vividness and 
fulness. But such is not the case with A (what A was): it 
can never acquire the primary characteristics of the primary 
memory image; on the other hand, it has a certain complete- 
ness which does not belong to a (the so-called representation 
of A), which latter in comparison seems elusive and lacking 
in stability. a and QA can thus not be identified in any 
sense. | 
It is also clear that a is not a presentation again of A 
(what A was), and I myself can see no ground whatever for 
the assertion that a is a presentation again of A itself. 
Sec. 21. It appears then that in the introspective experi- 
ence of the recognition of what we call images or representa- 
tions we have no evidence whatever that they are exact 
reproductions of any previously existing presentations, and 
therefore the occurrence of these images or representations 
does not stand in opposition to the view already maintained 
that each complex presentation as experienced is a perfectly 
new one.  
-P-A-G-E-99
  
  
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 85 
Our use of terms is evolved out of the every day needs 
of practical life. In this practical life we assume that 
the objects around us are what we call “the same” from 
moment to moment, although when we consider the matter 
carefully we know they cannot be actually so. It is only 
for convenience and for practical utility that we assume this 
identity even of object as the source of successive primary 
presentations, and of their connected images or secondary 
presentations. 
In quite a similar manner we assume that the primary 
presentations arising in connection with successive experi- 
ences (and compared as secondary presentations in a new 
moment) are the same from moment to moment; but it 
must be acknowledged that this assumption, like the one first 
mentioned, is based, not upon any real permanency, but upon 
the needs of practical life. If we did not constantly react 
upon our environment just as if the secondary presentation 
of any one moment was what we call “the same as” the 
primary presentation of the previous moment,—just as if the 
primary presentation of one moment had what we speak of as 
permanent elements which ran over into the secondary 
presentation of the next moment, we should be unable to 
continue our existence as organic beings. It is this demand 
of practical life which has fastened upon us the crude notion 
that successive presentations are in some measure not always 
new and unique. 
Sec. 22. In order to avoid misconception it is to be 
noted that the view that each presentation is new and 
unique does not stand in any opposition to that form of 
experience which leads us to describe consciousness as a 
stream, or to speak of what Dr. Ward calls the “ presenta- 
tion continuum.” At any given moment we have as it 
were a cross section of the stream of consciousness ; and 
it is this cross section which we speak of as being always 
new and unique. When we have the experience which  
-P-A-G-E-100
Pee t 
86 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
forms the basis of our conception of the “presentation 
continuum” we are taking a retrospective view of many 
successive presentations which have occurred in successive 
moments. But the presentation which we thus describe 
, as “our conception of the presentation continuum”’ is 
itself new and unique. 
C. Of Recurrence. 
Sec. 23. We have thus far minimized the importance of 
noetic recurrence in our effort to emphasize the fact that 
each noetic state must be entirely new. This latter truth 
may be accepted however without leading to the denial 
of the self-evident fact that successive psychical states occur 
which in the form of secondary presentations we compare 
and call ‘just alike.” For as we have just seen, our 
judgment that two successive conscious states are just alike 
does not imply that one of the two is an exact reduplication 
of the other. This point being accepted, we may without 
misunderstanding consider the nature of the recurrence of 
those physiological and psychical states which we call ‘just 
alike.” 
Sec. 24. The rhythmical beating of the heart and the 
scarcely noticeable activities of breathing, the less regular 
but still distinctly rhythmical activities in the alimentary 
canal, the alternation of sleeping and waking states, are 
commonplace examples of physiological recurrence which 
must involve the recurrence of neururgic activities: and 
if we look a little deeper we are led to see that these 
are but special instances of a very general tendency.’ But 
beyond these effects, which are directly or indirectly due 
to the rhythmical nature of stimuli, it is evident that 
the constitution of our complex nervous system itself is 
such that it tends to act in a more or less distinctly 
1 Confer Bain, Emotions and Will, Sec. 37, p. 44.
-P-A-G-E-101
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 87 
rhythmical way, even under conditions of continuous 
stimulation.’ 
In our complex bodily system any active neural elements 
must recuperate by the absorption of nutrition from other 
parts which are very indirectly connected with the active 
part; and this itself must involve neururgic recurrence. 
For if a neural element @ is stimulated to activity it at 
once telegraphs, so to speak, to special nervous centres, 
which in turn telegraph to the vaso-motor nerves, which 
in turn telegraph to the heart, asking for an extra supply 
of blood. Some time must elapse however before the 
heart can answer and before the arteries can carry the added 
supply; and in the meantime the capacity of @ to act has 
been lessened, to be increased again as soon as the increased 
supply of nourishment is brought to it: then there is 
heightened activity again, followed by another less degree 
of activity, and another telegraphic message, and another 
wait for the needed blood. The action thus simply stated 
is of course really enormously complicated; the operators 
at the heart end, or at the intermediate signal stations, 
may be too busy with other calls to attend to the call 
from 4; or complications may arise on the way so that 
the extra blood supplied by the arteries is drawn off in 
other directions than those which would bring it to a. 
Although the above is an almost absurdly simplified 
picture of the highly complex processes of nervous activity 
in relation to those of nutritive supply, it will serve to 
1“ The nerve process,” says Hoffding (Outlines of Psychology, Chapter 
v.), “whatever its nature may be, is carried on in pulsating beats or 
oscillations, It is the highest law of the general physiology of the nerves, 
that a nerve process can never be set up by a state of equilibrium, but 
only by sudden changes, effected with a certain rapidity, in the condition 
of the nerve. A seemingly continuous nerve process (tetanus) is really 
only brought about by a series of quickly succeeding changes of equi- 
librium. The-relations in the individual sense-organs, so far as known, 
accord with this law.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
88 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
show that the emphases of neural activity which produce 
special neururgic patterns can never be expected to be 
continuous, but must be of an immensely complex, yet 
for all that of a more or less recurrent, nature.’ And if 
this is true, then we should expect to find that where 
complex emphases produce special distinctive neururgic 
patterns, these patterns would not appear to persist con- 
tinuously, but would occur in a more or less rhythmical 
form. Whenever then neururgic patterns appear again and 
again as the result of this tendency they may be spoken 
of as recurrent neururgic patterns. 
It is not to be implied that such recurrences will always 
be recognizable. Even though they tend to appear they are 
likely often to be obliterated as it were by other patterns 
which are aroused by powerful stimuli. But it is not too 
much to assume that the recurrence of a given neururgic 
pattern involves the establishment of relations between 
neururgic parts which renders the system quick to develop 
anew what we call the “‘self-same” pattern ; that is to say, 
a given neururgic pattern has within itself the essential 
qualities which, apart from inhibition, will lead to its re- 
currence. 
Evidently the establishment of these relations which lead 
to recurrence will depend largely upon the force, and per- 
sistence, of the stimuli which produce the original occurrence ; 
and this whether these stimuli are due to action upon the 
organism from the environment, or are entirely within 
the system in parts extraneous to the parts in which the 
original occurrence is given. This point will be found to 
1As indicative of the complexity of the rhythmical process we 
may quote the following passage from Loeb’s Physiology of the Brain, 
p- to. In speaking of the rhythmical contractions of the muscles, 
he says: ‘observations in the lower animals show that the co- 
ordination of automatic movements is caused by the fact that the 
element which beats most quickly forces the others to beat in its own 
rhythm.”

be of interest when we consider the noetic correspondences 
below. 
Sec. 25. Turning now to the noetic view, we here see 
clearly the correspondences we should expect to discover. 
In the field of impression evidences of this noetic recurrence 
are clearly observed by us when, for instance, we study the 
phenomena of “after images,’ which appear, fade away, and 
reappear, in negative or positive form, in a very distinctly 
rhythmical manner;—and this be it noted without any recur- 
rence of the stimulation of the sense organs which originally 
called them forth. Taking a step away from the impressional 
field we may mention as an example the familiar experience 
of ‘‘a tune running in one’s head”’: here a special sequence 
of secondary presentations of musical notes occurs and 
recurs; it being often observable in my own experience 
that some striking musical phrase of a given aria is repeated 
over and over again, the whole aria not being carried through, 
the special phrase in repetition appearing to break in upon 
the sequence of notes before it can be developed to a close. 
Taking a still further step from the region of impression; all 
of us must note the persistent recurrence of special ideas, 
especially marked in morbid cases as idées fixes. 
If it is remarked that within the realm of ideas, as distin- 
guished from impressions, rhythm of recurrence is ordinarily 
not noticeable, it is also to be said that this is natural when 
we consider the complexity of the phenomena within this 
realm, and their disturbance by impressional presentations. 
In every day life, and to ordinary observation, we of course 
cannot expect that delicate and relatively exact rhythms 
will often be noted: but we do not intend to insist that 
noetic patterns recur in recognizable rhythms: all that we 
are here concerned to note is that this noetic recurrence 
is as deep a law of our psychic life as the corresponding 
neururgic recurrence is of our physical life. As Stout says!

in discussing habit; “one necessary and omnipresent 
condition of the formation of habit is the tendency of 
any mental process with its connected movements to repeat 
itself, simply because it has occurred before,—a tendency 
which grows stronger the more frequently the process 
occurs.” 
It will appear clear to the reader that each of such recur- 
rent presentations is always of the nature of what we have 
called a secondary presentation. Now while we cannot call 
such a secondary presentation a “representation” without 
great danger of self-deception, we surely may call it a revival. 
It is a presentation born again, a new living presentation 
whose form is determined by what was an old life :—but 
for the previous existence of the primary presentation the 
secondary presentation would not be what it is. All this is 
as far from saying that the secondary presentation is a re- 
presentation as it would be to say that I am the same thing 
as the mother who gave me birth.1_ From now on I shall 
therefore speak of these recurrent secondary presentations as 
revivals. 
As we have remarked above, neururgic recurrences are 
largely dependent upon the force, and persistence, of the 
1It is to be noted here that there is some difference of usage of terms in 
this connection. Only certain revivals are memories. This distinction in 
my view should be kept clear. But the word memory is often applied 
recklessly to designate any sort of recall, or revival, or so-called representa- 
tion. It is to be noted that Miss Calkins in her Introduction to Psychology 
makes the distinction of my text; but uses the term “memory ” to describe 
what I call “revival,” and the term “recognition” to describe what I call 
“memory.” I prefer the terms I use because the word memory is now 
commonly employed to apply to what I call by that name, and to what 
Miss Calkins calls recognition: and although, as I have said above, the 
word is carelessly used to apply to states which are not cases of recognition, 
I believe its use in proper connections cannot be displaced. 
It is also to be noted that Dr. James Ward (Encyclopedia Britannica Article, 
p. 47) places “retentiveness” in opposition to both recognition and memory 
which he distinguishes from one another (p. 63).
-P-A-G-E-105
THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 91 
original neururgic occurrences; and as revivals are the 
psychic correspondents of these neururgic recurrences, we 
should expect to note that the appreciated force, and 
persistence, of the original primary or secondary presenta- 
tions would be recognized as having close relations with 
the process of revival. That such is the case is recognized 
by all psychologists, this being especially noted in their 
studies of association and memory which we consider in 
Book 1. 
Sec. 26. At this juncture it may be well to enquire 
whether it can be held that all of our secondary presenta- 
tions inclusive of what we call our ideas can be shown to be 
revivals, or combinations of revivals, of primary presentations 
or sensational impressions. 
It happens that attention has been largely concentrated by 
psychologists in the past upon secondary presentations which 
can be traced back to primary presentations: and it has been 
discovered that in a large number of cases where we experi- 
ence secondary presentations which are not immediately 
appreciated to have been connected with primary presenta- 
tions, more thorough study shows us that correspondent 
primary presentations have nevertheless in the past been 
experienced by us. This has led to the claim of the 
associationist psychologists that all secondary presentations 
can be traced back finally to primary presentations. It is 
true that a difficulty in connection with such a view appears 
in the fact that certain secondary presentations appear in 
connection with which it would seem that no corresponding 
primary presentations could possibly have existed: e.g. the 
“factors of safety”? used in engineering work, the ‘co- 
efficients” used in algebraic manipulation. But these the 
associationists explained, by claiming that they were due to the 
summation of, or guasi chemical combination of, secondary 
presentations which could be traced back to primary pre- 
sentations: a view however that involved the assumption, 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
FE 
92 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
which we find unwarranted, that presentations have in some 
way a permanent character. A little consideration will show 
us that under our view we should expect to find just such 
forms of secondary presentation. 
Sec. 27. We have found reason to believe that each 
primary presentation involves what in itself would be a 
secondary presentation, which latter does not lose its essential 
form when the stimulations from the environment which 
produced the primary form cease. There must then exist 
what we may call secondary noetic patterns involved with 
the more marked primary noetic patterns. 
Evidently the primary noetic patterns, being due to inter- 
mittent stimulation must be so variable in their nature that 
we may speak of them as displaying an intermittent form. 
/ The secondary noetic patterns on the other hand not being 
directly determined by variable environmental stimuli must 
be continuous in their efficiency, whether they lead to dis- 
tinctly noticeable presentations or not. The secondary pre- 
sentations as a class must form a continuum apart from the 
intermittent primary presentations, so that we may speak 
of a secondary presentation continuum running smoothly 
parallel with the more variable primary-presentation con- 
tinuum. 
It is from presentations within this secondary-presentation   
continuum, we may assume, that develop by combination 
new forms of secondary presentations in connection with 
which no corresponding primary presentations could have | 
existed. But it must be noted at this point that secondary 
presentations of the type now considered separate themselves 
away rather sharply not only from primary presentations, 
but also from those secondary presentations which we have 
called revivals. That they are developed out of what might 
be revivals seems clear; but it is equally clear that they may 
be due to the coincident effects of revivals whose primary 
presentations could not possibly have been coincident ; and
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 93 
if such is the case it is evident not only that they cannot 
be traced back to primary presentations, but also that they 
cannot with propriety be called revivals. 
1If we turn again to the consideration of the general nature of recurrence, 
we note that, within the whole body of a man, neururgic patterns may 
recur at long intervals, and at such long intervals that we may well conceive 
the neural elements involved in the first case to have become senile and to 
have died, and to have been replaced by others, at the time of the recur- 
rence. Similarly on a higher scale we see that individual organisms,—and 
this is specially marked among the higher animals,—develop in given ways 
determined by what we call inheritance ; so that, although one generation 
gives place to another, given activities and given neururgic patterns appear 
in individuals of successive generations, which activities seem to be deter- 
mined by forces altogether unrelated to the individual’s own experience. 
Neururgic patterns which are thus described as recurrent appear in man 
considered as a species, quite apart from the life experience of the individual 
in whom they appear. 
Now if this is true it is clear that, if the hypothesis of correspondence is 
valid, noetic patterns must also appear in the form of what we call recur- 
rences in individual men from one generation to another which are 
determined by inheritance, and which are not in the main due to the 
individual’s experience : and if the emphases within these noetic patterns 
are sufficiently marked it is clear that they may appear as ideas in the field 
of attention. 
We seem thus forced to return in a way to the doctrine of innate ideas ; 
ie. to deny the verbal correctness at least of the thesis which Locke so 
strenuously opposed ; although, as is apparent, this doctrine must now be 
held in a very different form from that which Locke attacked. 
We surely cannot hold that any idea that we have can be what it is but 
for the experience of life which may have modified what it would have 
been as the result of mere inheritance: but on the other hand we must 
grant that the essential part of many of our ideas must be given to us by 
mere inheritance. 
The correctness of this view seems to be practically proven by the 
marvellous mental development of Helen Keller; blind, and deaf, and 
dumb. It seems evident that almost as wide a range of ideas are pre- 
sented to her as are presented to me; and it is difficult to comprehend 
how this can be the case unless, apart from the experiences of her life, 
ideas have been presented to her corresponding with neururgic patterns 
which arise in her nervous system as the result of inheritance from her 
ancestors.
-P-A-G-E-108
94 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
  Sec. 28. In closing this chapter we may well note that 
given secondary noetic patterns are brought into prominence 
as recurrences just because they have in them elements 
which have been common to previously occurring primary 
or secondary noetic patterns. This is the phenomena upon 
which-are based the so-called laws of association of which we 
speak elsewhere. 
This being true we should expect to find certain noetic 
patterns which appear in emphatic form at one time, but 
which fail to become revivable simply because they have 
failed to assimilate with the broad noetic pattern of the 
moment in which they appeared. Assimilation is thus a 
most significant factor in our life of thought, in which 
secondary presentations are of such pre-eminent importance. 
This point is worth noting because it brings out clearly the 
fact that not all secondary, nor even all primary, presenta- 
tions, must necessarily be revivable. We often realize that 
objective conditions have existed which would usually induce 
a certain noetic pattern, of which pattern however we are 
able to gain no revival : and we are wont to assume all too 
often that no such noetic pattern existed: that is to say, 
because we cannot revive a given mental state we are apt to 
think it did not exist in the past in connection with conditions 
which usually would make it prominent in attention. But it 
must be agreed that the most we have a right to claim is 
that the noetic pattern failed to be assimilated, and therefore 
cannot be revived in the complex noetic patterns of the 
moment of reflection. 
Beyond this we may note that certain activities of the 
nervous system in a moment @ may be of such slight 
importance that they will be unable to produce an effective 
modification of the neururgic pattern of that moment, but 
must be part and parcel of the vast mass of undifferentiable 
activities against which not only each neururgic emphasis, 
but even the pattern itself stands out in contrast. A large
-P-A-G-E-109
    THE MUTABILITY OF PRESENTATIONS 95 
proportion of the so-called reflex actions are of just this 
nature : and as such their psychic coincidents should not be 
expected to effect the coincident noetic pattern of the 
moment ; for these psychic coincidents must be constituents 
of that vast mass of psychic elements which form the Self,— 
the background against which appear by contrast the 
presentations which determine the form of the noetic pattern 
of the moment a. If the psychic correspondents of these 
reflex acts do not form a part of the presentation in the 
moment @ it cannot be expected, under any but extraordinary 
conditions, that they will affect the form of presentation of a 
subsequent moment / in the shape of a revival. But this 
should not lead us to hold that these psychic elements 
corresponding with the reflex actions did not affect in some 
measure the mass of the consciousness as a whole in that 
moment 4. 
No assumption in psychology is more persistent, and none 
more unwarranted, than that which leads us to assert that a 
psychic form was not given in consciousness at some one 
moment because we can obtain no revival of this form in a 
subsequent moment. We are led by this unwarranted 
assumption into all sorts of difficulties which will be con- 
sidered from time to time as we proceed with our work: and 
I take this opportunity to make my protest against the 
careless assumption that all forms that appear in conscious- 
ness at any special moment considered are necessarily 
revivable in attention in future moments. 
It is to be noted on the other hand that, if our conception 
of the existence of a secondary presentation continuum is 
correct, submerged noetic patterns of various forms must be 
constantly developing within the field of inattention : and if 
this is true we should expect that the coincidence of 
efficiencies within such diverse noetic patterns would occa- 
sionally result in the production of noetic emphases 
sufficiently marked to appear in attention. Thus we should
-P-A-G-E-110
96 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
expect to note the appearance at times of fully developed 
thoughts unpreceded by any such presentations as would 
normally be appreciated as the antecedents of such 
thoughts. We note just such experiences in what is 
usually spoken of as ‘unconscious cerebration,” of which 
we speak later.

  APPENDIX A. 
CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS IN RELATION TO THE 
DIVERSE TYPES OF PRESENTATIONS REFERRED 
TO IN CHAPTER IV. 
Sec. 1. We have seen that we may group our presenta- 
tions broadly as receptive, reactive, and coordinative. It is 
true that if we attempt to fix within these classes the position 
of all forms of presentations we are met by serious difficulties. 
Sensations are distinctly receptive in quality, instinct ex- 
periences are as distinctly reactive, and the realm of thought 
is clearly coordinative: but on the other hand sensations, 
percepts, concepts, images, desires, impulses, instinct experi- 
ences and emotions, voluntary efforts, form what we may 
roughly describe as a continuous series, no one element of 
which when analyzed is found to be altogether exclusive 
of any other element, each element being differentiated from 
the others, and from the whole, merely by its emphasis within 
the whole field of conscious experience. 
It will evidently be impossible to consider here each special 
psychic quality, for this would mean the description of every 
one of the innumerable differentiable forms of presentation 
discovered in experience. On the other hand, it may be well 
for us to study briefly certain points in relation to the main 
groups referred to in order to note the bearing of our con- 
ceptions upon certain points which may seem to some readers 
to be open to question. 
G

I. Tue Sensations. 
  Sec. 2. A few points only require consideration in rela- 
tion to the receptive group of noetic emphasis. 
The sensations are due to emphatic activities which are 
themselves not strictly limited to the terminal organs, but 
which involve the activity of the adjacent minor nervous 
systems of which they are the outlying parts.! It has been 
held however by many neurologists in the past that when we 
experience a given sensation the effective emphatic activity 
is concentrated in one centre, or in some very limited group 
of centres, in the brain. This view cannot well be main- 
tained however when we consider that what we know of the 
structure of the nervous system leads us to see that it is all 
but impossible to think of a very emphatic partial activity 
which does not spread its influence far beyond the centres in 
which the greatest emphasis appears. And when we consider 
our experience with care we discover that a sensation always 
has in it something that appears to be apart from the corre- 
spondent of the direct results of the stimulation: what the 
psychologists are wont to call apperception is involved with 
even the simplest sensation.? Whatever may be the con- 
ditions of activity in the nervous system it is certain that 
when we experience a sensation the presentation involves a 
1Sidis (Psychological Review, January and March, 1908) holds that where 
sound-photisms, light-phonisms, etc., occur, a stimulus to one sense gives 
rise to what must be designated as, not an image, but a true sensation 
belonging to another sense than that directly stimulated: and he holds 
that in normal perception the same sort of “secondary sensations” occur, 
the only difference being that they are closely fused with the primary 
sensation, whereas in synesthesia they are partially dissociated. All the 
facts upon which this view is based are readily accounted for by the fact 
that the minor nervous systems in the receptive group are much more 
closely integrated than any one of them is with any minor nervous system 
outside of this receptive group.

OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 99 
somewhat broad field within which the sensation appears as 
an especially emphatic part. 
It is clear of course that the emphatic nervous activities 
which arise in connection with the stimulation of the sense 
organs are less diffused throughout the whole nervous system 
than those which occur when the system as a whole is 
aroused : and inasmuch as stimulations from the environment 
are forced upon us from without, and are for the most part 
beyond control, and are often very powerful, it is natural to 
find, as we do, that our sensational presentations are very 
prominent in our experience. Nevertheless as the emphatic 
activities thus initiated become diffused, broader minor sys- 
tems must become emphatically active; and thus we find 
sensations widening out, as it were, into what we call percepts, 
of which we speak later. 
The vividness of sensation is so marked however that it 
is not at all unnatural to find that many psychologists have 
assumed that our sensations are the basis of all of our con- 
scious life. But while it is true that we cannot think of 
human consciousness as we experience it apart from the 
constant recurrence of this sensational initiation of psychic 
activity ; nevertheless there seems little ground, as we have 
already seen, for the common view that the middle region 
of thought, if we may so speak, is sensational in its nature. 
It is easily conceivable that the broader minor nervous 
systems, the activities in which are coincident with thought, 
might, under other conditions than those actually realized, be 
stimulated to activity in other ways than by sensational stimu- 
lation; and these emphatic activities, being in other and 
diverse minor systems than those directly related to the 
activities connected with sensation, must be looked upon as 
diverse from the latter, even though we agree that in their 
basic character these diverse psychic systems are similar in 
their nature, just as the activities of all neural systems have 
a fundamental unity of nature.   LIBRARY

It appears therefore that it cannot be maintained that 
all consciousness is directly or derivatively of a sensational 
nature. 
Sec. 3. One point of considerable importance may here 
be noted, viz. that as pleasures and pains as such are, under 
the view to be presented in Book 11., general qualities of all 
presentations, no forms of them can be what are usually called 
specific sensations of which pressure, touch, cold, taste, etc., 
are types. What are called physical pleasures and physical 
pains, and which are thought by many to be such specific 
sensations, are really sensations which are markedly pleasant 
or painful as the case may be. The arguments in favor of 
this view, to which I refer again in Book m. Chapter xr., 
have been so fully covered in my Pain, Pleasure, and 
Aesthetics (pp. 15-32), that it does not appear worth while 
to do more here than call attention to a few objections that 
have been made since that volume was published. 
Sec. 4. This view that pleasures and pains are of a sen-_ 
sational nature is generally tacitly abandoned now-a-days so 
far as pleasure is concerned, although the same cannot be 
said concerning pain. Stumpf in an address before the 
Second Congress of Experimental Psychologists, and in 
fuller form in the Zeitschrift f. Psychologie, Bd. 44, has reiter- 
ated the claim that pains are sensations without making an 
attempt to reply to many objections raised to this view, as for 
instance in my published discussions, which indeed (see his 
footnote on p. 24) he incidentally says he has not read! In 
his treatment of the subject I find no argument which I have 
not considered in my book above mentioned except one 
which he takes from Kiilpe, and which I consider below in 
Chapter x1., and again in Chapter xx. Sec. 4, footnote.?

Unpleasantness,” Psychological Review, xv. 4, p. 205, foot-note. Also my

2 A good example of the difficulties connected with the acceptance of the 
sensational view is found in the pain of toothache. If there are pain sense
-P-A-G-E-115
OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 101 
The emphasis of pain in the region of sensation is so 
marked that there is now a tendency to attempt to dodge 
the acknowledgment that pain is a quality which may be 
experienced in connection with other presentations than sen- 
sations by separating physical pain (schmerz) from disagree- 
ableness (unlust) ; the former being held to be of a sensational 
type, the latter a quality which may belong to other states 
than sensations. No similar attempt however is commonly 
made in relation to pleasure: and it is to be noted in this 
connection that as without any question our most vivid of 
pleasures are sensational, just as our most vivid of pains are 
sensational ; so if we separate schmerz from unlust, we should 
in like manner separate sense pleasures from other pleasures. 
The reason why we tend to emphasize pain as sensation, 
rather than pleasure as sensation, is clearly because action 
which is destructive of the tissues, and which produces 
physical pain (schmerz), is experienced frequently most per- 
sistently, and this because of the lesions involved which do 
not readily heal ; while there is no similar basis for the special 
persistence and recurrence of physical pleasures. 
terminals in the teeth we must assume them to be placed there by nature 
to give notice of danger to the teeth, which danger the organism will tend 
to avoid when pain accrues. But as a matter of fact the pain terminals, if 
such there be, are placed so deep in the body of the tooth that the pain 
does not appear until the destructive action upon the tooth has gone so far 
that the natural man cannot avoid the danger. His only mode of stopping 
the pain is to extract the tooth, thus reducing the efficiency of his digestive 
processes, 
It may be noted in this connection that Sherrington (Integrative Action of 
the Nervous System), who accepts the view that there are “pain” end organs, 
finds that they form an exception to the rule that the function of the sense 
organs is to lower the threshold for a particular sort of stimulus, while 
simultaneously raising the threshold for other stimuli, so as to make possible 
different reactions to different classes of stimuli. The “pain” organs he 
holds are not specially adapted to any one physical stimulus, but respond to 
a stimulus of any sort which threatens injury to the part where the pain 
organ is located. Such a very special relation to environmental stimulation 
surely argues against the classification of pains with specific sensations. 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
102 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
I do not consider this separation of physical from other 
pleasures and pains fundamentally important; it is but a 
special form of the natural division of psychic states which 
for so long led to the adoption of the so-called “faculty 
psychology.” 
Sec. 5. One point of importance in relation to the 
sensational realm must not be overlooked here. Notwith- 
standing the fact that these so-called receptive minor nervous 
systems are concerned with the incidence of energy to the 
total complex nervous system ; nevertheless in one and the 
same moment these minor nervous systems as such must 
themselves be looked upon as both receptive and reactive. 
Objective evidence shows them to be receptive of stimuli 
from the environment, and indicates that as thus stimulated 
they communicate energy to adjacent parts by a process of 
diffusion. 
In like manner subjective experience shows that our sen- 
sations, while receptive in relation to the whole psychic 
system, are in themselves not only of a receptive nature, but 
also at the same time of a reactive nature. This appears in 
the fact that sensational experience is always to be noted as 
arousing more complex forms of experience in perception 
and conception, of which we speak more fully later on. 
Il. Tue Reactive Srares. 
Sec. 6. In the complex nervous system there are, as we 
have seen, groups of minor systems which relate directly to 
the reaction of the organism as a whole upon its environment. 
Emphases of the activities within these groups must give to 
us specially noticeable neururgic patterns, which will display 
characteristics which are not common to all neururgic patterns, 
but which are special because due to the limitation to these 
special groups of the emphases which characterize them. 
The typical reactions of complex organisms and of rela- 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
     OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 103 
tively simple organisms, when objectively viewed, all appear 
to be of forms fitted to conserve the life of the individual 
organism, or the persistence of the race to which the indi- 
vidual belongs. As we commonly speak of these actions as 
due to the existence of instincts, we may for convenience 
speak of them as ‘“‘instinct actians.? But if by ‘instinct 
actions”? we mean reactions which have biological significance 
for the individual in which they appear, and use the term 
in reference to the reactions of relatively simple organisms, 
we may well extend the use of the term to the reactions of 
the simplest of cells; for these reactions also subserve the 
advantage of the individual cell. Thus I use the term 
“instinct action” to describe the reaction of any elemental 
nervous part, of any systematized aggregate of nervous ele- 
ments, and of the whole broadly systematized nervous mass 
as a whole. : 
If the theory of thoroughgoing neururgic and noetic 
correspondence is valid the reactions of the human organism 
which we thus designate as its “‘instinct actions” must 
develop special forms of neururgic patterns in which certain 
special emphases will appear ; and corresponding with which 
there will appear in consciousness presentations of special 
forms, which we may designate as “‘instinct experiences.” 
That very clearly differentiated forms of instinct experiences 
constantly appear in the field of attention cannot be ques- 
tioned. When I suddenly catch myself falling on a slippery 
pavement, I have an instinct experience of a specific kind ; 
and when I quickly throw up my arm to ward off an expected 
blow, and in all similar cases, special forms of instinct 
experience become prominent in attention. And beyond 
these very clearly differentiated cases careful introspection 
must convince one that the constantly occurring adjustments 
of our body to its environment, even where these lack 
emphasis or suddenness, are accompanied by very special 
forms of instinct experience.   
  
-P-A-G-E-118
104 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Sec. 7. Our general considerations lead us to see that our 
instinct actions involve not only the reactive minor nervous 
systems, but a throb of the whole nervous systems,—the 
formation of special neururgic patterns in which certain 
parts are emphatically active. But it is to be noted that the 
emphasis of special activities does not imply that the rest of 
the activities of the whole nervous system fail to have their 
influence upon the form of the neururgic pattern of the 
moment. 
Correspondingly we are led to see that each special instinct 
experience involves a throb, so to speak, of the whole noetic 
system, the formation within consciousness of a special noetic 
pattern, in which certain psychic parts are so emphasized that 
they appear as presentations. But it is to be noted that the 
existence of psychic emphases of a special type does not imply 
that the rest of the noetic system fails to have its influence 
upon the form of the noetic pattern of the moment. These 
instinct-experiences therefore may be said to be characterized 
by a quality determined by. the fact that the psychic emphases 
which distinguish them are not found in all presentations, 
but only in those which bear relation to noetic patterns 
accompanying reactions upon our environment. 
Sec. 8. In the complex human nervous system we dis- 
cover that the activities of the specialized centers which relate 
to the reaction of the organism as a whole upon its environ- 
ment are themselves sources of stimulation to the system 
at large. Thus we find connections existing between the 
reactive centers and the receptive and coordinative centers 
of the organism of such a nature that the activities of the 
organism’s reactive centers lead to stimulations within the 
organism’s receptive and coordinative centers. The con- 
nections between the reactive and the receptive centers are 
traceable with a fair degree of clearness; those between the 
reactive and coordinative less clearly, but of the existence 
of the latter there can be little doubt. We shall speak 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
         OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 105 
more especially however of the connections between the 
reactive and receptive centers concerning which there is no 
question. 
The activities of the specialized reactive systems then are 
sources of stimulative activities in relation to the total system, 
which while differing from the activities due to stimulation 
of the organism from the environment are nevertheless of 
the same general nature so far as the pre-eminent system in 
the brain is concerned, which is stimulated from without itself 
in much the same way in both cases. This is a result of the 
complexity of our neural systems which involves the necessity 
of the adjustment of opposed reactive tendencies; of the 
guidance or inhibition of certain reactions which under some 
circumstances are valuable, but which under others are dis- 
advantageous ; an adjustment which is only obtained as the 
result of the complex relation of minor neural systems within 
the greater system. The beginnings of the activity of one 
minor reactive system affect directly or indirectly another 
minor receptive or central system, and this minor receptive 
or central system reacts to guide or inhibit the activity which 
is just beginning in the reactive minor system first affected. 
It is very clear thus that the psychic correspondent of the 
instinct action must be a noetic pulse which involves not 
only the psychic correspondents of the activities within the 
reactive centers themselves, but also the psychic correspon- 
dents of those activities within the system which are produced 
indirectly by what Lloyd Morgan has well called a ‘back 
stroke” from the reactive parts to the parts which have to 
do with the receptivity. And it is clear that it may well be 
that under certain conditions the ‘‘ back stroke” activity will 
be sufficiently powerful to so determine the special form of 
the neururgic pattern that the form of the corresponding 
noetic pattern will be apparently determined solely by sen- 
sational elements, although really these are merely emphatic, 
and not exclusively important, in the whole psychic state.     
-P-A-G-E-120
106 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
That these sensational elements, from muscle and blood 
vessel, etc., etc., are important determinants of our instinct- 
experiences in general cannot be doubted; and in certain 
cases they become of so great importance that in introspection 
they attract exclusive attention, as we shall presently see. 
We must never however overlook the fact that the noetic 
pattern corresponding with an instinct action must necessarily 
involve the psychic modification of all parts of the system 
whose corresponding nervous activities are modified at the 
moment of the reaction. 
If our reactive ‘‘instinct experiences” are of the nature 
thus described it is evident that there must be an enormous 
number of them, each of which is sui generis, each differenti- 
ated by the diverse emphases in diverse parts, so to speak, 
of the highly complex human conscious system. It is true, 
as Professor James has said,! that no other mammal, not even 
the monkey, shows so large an array of diverse types of 
instinct actions as man does. And in correspondence with 
these diverse forms of instinct actions there exist similarly 
diverse forms of instinct experiences. 
Sec. 9. It is clear that certain of these instinct experiences 
may be more often repeated than others; that certain of 
them may be more regular in their occurrence than others ; 
that certain of them may be commonly more emphatic than 
others ; and that certain of them may involve more definitely 
than others the repetition of ‘‘the same” psychic elements. 
Where ‘‘the same” psychic elements are involved in any 
class of emphatic experiences we have the basis for the naming 
of the class. 
If we discover any class of instinct experiences which occur 
often but not with great regularity ; which when they occur 
must be emphatic if they are to be effective; and which 
involve at each recurrence practically ‘‘the same” psychic 
elements ; then it is likely that we shall find ourselves giving

         OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 107 
to this class of instinct experiences a definite name. Such 
a class of instinct experiences, in my view, we have in what 
we call our Emotions.* 
lt is to be remarked that there has been a tendency among psychologists 
to describe pain and pleasure as emotions; or to assume that the emotions 
are associated “representations” of pleasures and of pains, This latter 
assumption was natural to those who had become accustomed to thinking 
in terms of the atomistic psychology of the associationists; but that it is 
entirely inadequate I think has been shown in my Pain, Pleasure, and 
Aesthetics, It was seized upon to cover the difficulties connected with the 
more naive view that pain and pleasure are emotions: a view which at 
once shows its weakness when we note that pleasure and pain cannot in any 
way be thought of as instinct experiences, with which on the other hand 
the emotions must be acknowledged to be closely related. ‘The basis of 
both these views lies in the fact that our{instinct experiences in general are 
presentations involving many minor psychic emphase}. The emotions 
being instinct experiences in which these many minor emphases display 
marked elemental intensities must usually carry with them marked algedonic 
qualifications ; and the emotions therefore must be expected to display 
summational pleasure and summational pain of high degree. 
I can find no sufficient reason for holding with Dr. David Irons that we 
have in emotion an ultimate and primary aspect of mind. Nor can I 
accept the theory which Prof. J. R. Angell presents in his Psychology, in 
accordance with which “emotions appear whenever there is a conflict 
among \the motor pulses called forth by any special situation” (p. 323). 
For such conflicts must occur in some measure in connection with all the 
instinctive reactions in so complex an animal as man. Prof. Angell’s view 
would seem to imply that emotions as such must usually result in more or 
less of an inhibition of action of a nature related to the protection of the 
organism. But it is apparent that our most significant emotions are very 
distinctly correspondent with positive activities valuable to the organism 
as a whole, and the complex instinct actions thus corresponding with them 
are probably conserved in our life for this very reason. That certain of the 
emotions lead to some degree of paralysis of reactions is true; but this is 
not the case with all of them by any means (joy for instance) ; and where 
it is the case it is usually apparent that the paralysis is often of the essence 
of the protective adaptation (dread for instance); or is the outcome of 
exhaustion due to the very violence of the activities involved when the 
emotion is most vividly experienced. (Fear for instance begins with the 
extreme activities connected with escape : it may end in an exhaustive failure 
of activity ; but then the nature of the emotion is altogether altered.)  
-P-A-G-E-122
   
  
         108 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
This conception of the nature of the Emotions I have 
examined so fully in my Pain, Pleasure, and Aesthetics and 
in my Instinct and Reason that I may present it here very 
briefly. Under this view what we call our Emotions are 
nothing more nor less than special types of instinct- 
experiences corresponding with instinctive reactions which 
relate to the protection of the whole bodily system. The 
special emotional form is given in the fact that the most dis- 
tinctive types of emotion correspond with bodily reactions 
which must be prompt and forceful if they are to be effective 
(as in the case of Fear, Anger, etc.), and which for this reason 
must almost necessarily compel attention. Furthermore, they 
involve in all distinctive cases the psychic correspondents of 
certain particular sets of activities, which are distinguishable 
as complex units, and to which we are therefore able to attach 
definite names: with a large proportion of our instinct 
experiences this is not the case, and these are not designated 
as emotions. Furthermore, the emotions occur usually after, 
or together with, the appearance in attention, of a clear per- 
ception or conception of some object, or objective condition, 
in the outer-world series. 
If this view is correct we should expect to find, as we do 
find, our emotions varying in the degree of their forcefulness 
and immediacy. For instance, take the three groups: (A) 
1. dread, 2. fear, 3. panic ; (B) 1. affection, 2. love, 3. passion ; 
(C) 1. hostility, 2. hatred, 3. anger. Each of the emotions 
in each of the groups A, B, and C, is clearly differentiated ; 
yet each emotion is more closely related to the emotions 
within its group than with any outside of its group. At the 
same time, within these groups the emotions increase in 
forcefulness and immediacy from 1 to 3. 
We should also expect to find, as we do find, some cases 
in which the distinguishableness of the emotions is clear, but 
others where it passes into a vague diffuseness ; as affection 
is distinguished from passion, and hostility from anger.
-P-A-G-E-123
  
     OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 109 
If it is true that the emotions are distinguished from the 
instinct experiences in general by the relative forcefulness and 
suddenness of appearance, we might well,expect to find very 
prominent in them the sensational elements produced by the 
“back stroke,” and might expect these latter to be almost 
exclusively prominent in the analysis of reflection. It is to 
this fact that is due the force of the James-Lange ‘back 
stroke” theory of the emotions. This theory in the words: 
of James’ is that ‘‘the bodily changes follow directly the 
perception of the exciting fact and that our feeling of the 
same changes, as they occur, is the Emotion.” Verbally there 
is little to object to in this statement. But it is interpreted 
to mean that we first have the reactions, and then the sen- 
sational record of them, which latter constitutes the emotion. 
In my view this interpretation is incorrect. In the first place 
it is not correct to say either that the emotions cause the 
instinctive reaction, as is commonly held; nor to say that 
the instinctive reactions cause the emotions, as the common 
statement of the James-Lange theory implies. We do not 
strike as the result of anger as is commonly assumed, nor 
are we angry as the result of the neururgic situation which 
is evidenced in striking our enemy. The emotion is the 
coincident of the instinct action. We are angry and we strike 
at one and the same moment. 
Beyond this the emotion is the whole body of the instinct 
experience corresponding with the whole body of the instinct 
action, in which instinct experience the back stroke sen- 
sational elements are of so great moment that they usually 
alone appear in reflection; but in which these back stroke 
sensational elements are not exclusive of the modification 
of the psychic parts directly involved with the reactive ele- 
ments themselves, nor of the realms which coordinate the 
receptive with the reactive realms. As Professor Royce 
well says, “in addition to all states of our organs of 
1 Psychology, ii. 449.   
  
-P-A-G-E-124
  
        110 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
external and: bodily sense, purely central nervous condi- 
tions have much to do with the tone and intensity of our 
emotions.” ! 
Thus in my view the James-Lange theory stands in need 
of restatement to make it tenable. Instinct experiences (of 
which emotions are a special form) are the psychic coincidents 
of complex instinct actions, inclusive of those reactions 
to the stimuli from the reactive organs which by “ back 
strokes” affect the general system. They are therefore 
reactive experiences, and also at the same time ideational and 
sensational experiences of very complex form. They may 
best be described in their totality as the psychic coincidents 
of the total reactions of the total system upon its environment 
at the moment. The enunciation and discussion of the 
James-Lange theory has been chiefly valuable, in my opinion, 
in forcing upon us the knowledge of the fact of the relation 
of the emotions to the instincts. As James? well says, 
“instinctive reactions and emotional expressions shade imper- 
ceptibly into each other.” 
Sec. 10. Here again if we consider the constitution of 
the minor nervous systems which directly relate to our 
reaction upon the environment, we note that while there 
must exist a close bond between them all in the fact that they 
all bear a special relation to the mass of the nervous system, 
nevertheless they must be broadly differentiated into groups 
of closely allied minor systems, and within these groups into 
distinguishable minor systems of lower orders. 
Correspondingly in experience we find broad classes of 
instinct experiences, and of the emotions which are the most 
fixed and characteristic of these instinct experiences. We 
have, for instance, those which relate to what is advantageous 
1 Outlines of Psychology, p. 334. Mr. Stout in his Groundwork of Psychology 
(cf. pp. 192-195) shows himself to be in general agreement with the views 
I uphold.

  OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS IIL 
as contradistinguished from those which relate to what is 
disadvantageous ; love, and the instinct feelings relating to 
the attraction of others on the one hand; hate, anger, fear, 
etc., on the other. These groupings may be made in an 
indefinite number of ways. 
Beyond this we find that we may make, within any major 
group of instinct experiences, a great variety of minor dif- 
ferentiations. What Professor James says! of the emotions 
is equally true of all the instinct experiences of which the 
emotions are a special type: ‘‘If one should seek to name 
each particular one of them of which the human heart is the 
seat, it is plain that the limit of their number would be in 
the introspective vocabulary of the seeker, each race of men 
having found names for some shades of feeling which other 
races have left undiscriminated.” 
Sec. 11. We should expect to find that instinct experi- 
ences, inclusive of the emotions, would be less potent in 
influencing attention than sensations and their developments 
in percepts ; for the activities in reactions of the whole system 
upon its environment are broad in extent and are relatively 
well balanced in forcefulness. Thus it is that the region of 
instinct experience is vague and difficult of analysis, and this 
without doubt accounts for the fact that these instinct ex- 
periences in general have not been analysed until of late ; 
that they have been massed together as an indefinite region 
of “feeling” ;* that the specially marked instinct experiences 
which we call the emotions have for so long been misunder- 
stood, being identified by some with pleasures and pains, and 
by others subsumed roughly with the vague and elusive 
region of “‘feeling.” It is also because of this difficulty of 
holding the many elements of the instinct experiences in 
attention that those special elements in emotion which involve

true sensational qualities are alone apt to be considered in 
the analysis of the emotions. 
Sec. 12. We have overlooked thus far what may seem 
to some to be our most distinctive reactive presentations, 
viz. those which are described as our voluntary states, as our 
acts of will. This has been done deliberately however, and 
because these special distinctively reactive states always follow 
upon certain special states which we may describe as states 
of inhibition, and as the experiences inhibited are often dis- 
tinctly not of the reactive type, i.e. are not always instinct 
experiences, it will be more convenient to study these 
voluntary states in a later division of this Appendix. 
Sec. 13. In reference to the activities in the partial 
nervous systems relating to the reaction of the organism upon 
its environment we must note that although when we con- 
sider them superficially they appear to be reactive only, this 
is because we consider the system as a whole rather than the 
activities of the parts in themselves: evidently they are in 
themselves receptive and reactive in one and the same 
moment. Correspondingly on the psychic side, while the 
differentiations of consciousness connected with the reactions 
of the whole organism are emphatic in connection with our 
instinct experiences, nevertheless we note that these instinct 
experiences necessarily appear as stimulated from the great 
central psychic system at the very moment of this reaction 
of the organism upon the environment: and beyond this the 
activities corresponding with the sensational elements in these 
reactive states, of which we have spoken, are stimulated by 
these special reactions upon the environment at the same 
moment that they themselves react in the manner which pro- 
duces the sensational and other effects in consciousness. -It 
thus appears that each emphasis of this reactive nature is 
really in itself both receptive and reactive at one and the same 
moment.

III. Tue Coorpinative Srates. 
A. Of Ideas and their Groupings. 
Sec. 14. As we have seen, there exists an immensely 
complex group of minor nervous systems, the function of 
which is the coordination of the receptive with the reactive 
minor nervous systems. Within this complex coordinative 
group the minor systems vary greatly in degree and width 
of integration. If it is true that neururgic emphases corre- 
spond with noetic emphases or presentations, and that the 
correspondence is thoroughgoing, then we should be able in 
the first place to trace the existence of a broad group of what 
we may call coordinative noetic emphases corresponding with 
these coordinative neururgic emphases. That we do dis- 
cover such a broad group of coordinative noetic emphases 
is perfectly clear. When we exclude from consideration both 
those states of consciousness in which emphatic elements 
appear which are the correspondents of the receptive activities 
of the organism as a whole; viz. sensations ; and also those 
in which emphatic elements appear which are the correspon- 
dents of the reactive activities of the organism as a whole; 
viz. instinct experiences; in other words, when we exclude 
so far as may be all powerful stimulations from the environ- 
ment and are as nearly quiescent as possible, then psychic 
emphases or presentations still commonly appear. Although 
all the distinctly sensational and instinctive experiences are 
lacking we still have left the realm of thought, a broad field 
in which appear marked psychic emphases which are coinci- 
dent with the activities which relate together or coordinate 
the minor receptive and minor reactive nervous systems. 
This broad field of coordinative psychic emphases we may 
designate as the realm of ideas, using the word in a broad 
way somewhat as Locke did. 
H 
      
-P-A-G-E-128
114 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Sec. 15. If the theory of neururgic and noetic corre- 
spondence is true we should discover in experience an 
indefinitely large array of special forms of ideas which we 
may group in an indefinite variety of ways according as one 
or another minor psychic system, within the great coordina- 
tive group of minor psychic systems, is involved. And this 
expectation is evidently met in our experience. Within this 
broad coordinative group appear emphases as diverse as 
“after images,” and primary-memory-images, percepts, 
images of percepts, concepts, general notions, etc. None of 
these appear to belong distinctly to the receptive or reactive 
groups; nevertheless we discover so many instances of their 
being connected with, and yet intermediary between, the 
distinctly receptive and reactive emphases that there can be 
no question as to their broad general relations as above stated, 
although they may occasionally appear isolated because they 
are attended to at times when their related receptive and 
reactive emphases are not thus isolated in attention. 
When we attempt to group these ideas into classes we 
are naturally led to distinguish them, and to make a rough 
classification of them, somewhat as indicated in the serial 
arrangement given in the last paragraph, in accordance with 
our appreciation of their greater or less attachment to the 
realms of sensation in connection with which the initiation 
of psychic emphases commonly arises. ‘‘ After images” in 
fact appear to be largely of a sensational nature, but not 
exclusively sensational; for, as the name we give to them 
implies, they are very closely bound up with ordinary 
“images” which are, strictly speaking, quite apart from the 
sensational realm. The thought image of the glowing orb of 
the sun is closely bound to the “‘after-images” of the sun 
which I have in experience if by chance I look at the sun and 
then close my eyes: and yet the thought of the sun is far away 
from the sensational realm, while the “after image” is closely 
attached to it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
       OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 115 
Percepts are usually thought of as involving distinctly 
sensational elements related in a peculiarly definite manner. 
Still the bond between perceptual states and the realm: of 
ideas far removed from sensation is so close that we find 
Stout! saying: ‘‘ When I notice that I am desiring, doubting, 
impatient, or resentful, these processes do not act on any 
organ, or produce anything analogous to a sensation. My 
perception of them is not sense perception, but—it may be 
appropriately called perception.” 
Our concepts,—e.g. man,—are distinctly related to per- 
cepts,—e.g. individual men,—but they clearly separate them- 
selves away from the realm of sensation with which percepts 
are so closely identified. 
On the other hand we have definite thoughts of emotional 
conditions, and clear notions of reactive states in general, 
and of acts of will, which are as closely bound up with the 
reactive states as our percepts are with sensations. 
And then we have a broad realm of ideas which make 
up the bulk of our thoughts in studious moments, which 
are neither sensationally nor reactively connected, e.g. 
such ideas as ‘‘the theory of consciousness,” ‘‘ virtue,” 
“algebraic function.” 
Sec. 16. Certain of these ideational noetic emphases are 
found to be in general more emphatic than the mass of ideas ; 
and these, as we should expect, are those percepts which are 
most closely bound up with the sensational realm in which 
vividness is so often marked. The concepts, and general 
notions, and ideas within the realm of thought in general, 
are so lacking in emphasis that we find it necessary to remove 
ourselves from forceful stimuli—from the contact with the 
world to the quiet of the study—if we are to note their 
meaning and significance. 
Sec. 17. In accordance with the views already presented 
1 Groundwork of Psychology, p. 13 (italics mine). Cf. also Stout’s Analytical 
Psychology, ii. p. 4.     
  
-P-A-G-E-130
     
             116 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
  there must exist at times within the coordinate nervous 
group certain combinational neururgic emphases due to the 
fact, and which would not appear but for the fact, that 
emphases of activity in diverse but related nervous minor 
systems occur coincidently. Correspondingly we should 
expect to find ideas of a combinational nature, if we may so 
speak, due to the fact, and which would not appear but for 
the fact, that noetic emphases in diverse but related minor 
noetic systems occur coincidently. 
Such combinational emphases within the realm of ideas we 
clearly do experience. Concepts are of this nature. As 
Stout? says ‘A concept is not a mere faded mental picture : 
‘the fading’. . . must be of a certain kind and be due to 
certain conditions; it must be such as to produce a generic 
image. An image is called generic when it possesses a dis- 
tinct and salient centre or core corresponding to the common 
characteristics of this class, together with a vague and incon- 
stant margin corresponding to the specific features of the 
individuals composing the class.” Evidently the noetic 
emphasis described in this passage as ‘‘a distinct and salient 
centre or core” is a special noetic emphasis due to a coinci- 
dence of related but diverse noetic emphases, and which 
would not appear but for the existence of the latter. 
In the case of concepts the special emphasis above referred 
to is appreciably bound to the emphases to which its existence 
is due: the ‘‘core” is appreciated as closely related to the 
“‘vague and inconstant margin corresponding to the specific 
features of the individuals.” It is not easy, for instance, to 
have in mind the concept ‘‘ man” without a constant tendency 
to appreciate the characteristics of special individual men. 
But we experience many ideas which are resultants of other 
ideas in connection with which what Stout calls the ‘‘ margin” 
is not noted. Such noetic emphases,—such ideas,—as 
“theory of consciousness” as ‘‘ virtue” are clearly specific

noetic emphases the resultants of other ideas, and which 
would not be but for the existence of these other ideas, but 
which differ from the concepts referred to in the previous 
paragraph in the fact that they are very clearly distinct from 
the ideas upon which they depend for their existence, and do 
not necessarily suggest any specific ideas of this class. 
Of this same general nature are those special and highly 
important presentations which are bound up with all “ideas” 
and which when isolated as it were, and considered in them- 
selves, we describe as ‘“meanings.” Each meaning is very 
clearly sui generis; it would not exist but for the existence 
of that to which the meaning attaches, but it is of a nature 
that can seldom be traced back to any primary presentation.’ 
And when we consider the matter carefully it seems clear 
that the main body of our thoughts are presentations which 
involve no ‘‘images” whatever.2 In fact our mode of 
approach leads us to see that each presentation or noetic 
emphasis must necessarily be sui generis, and that we have 
no more right to assume that all our ideas are of the nature 
of images than we have right to assume that all our images 
are of a sensory nature, are ‘‘ washed out sensations,” a point 
which we have discussed fully in a previous chapter. 
Sec. 18. What we have considered in the preceding section 
becomes clearer when we note that certain of these combi- 
national noetic emphases must be due to relations which 
often occur in connection with a very great variety of special 
noetic emphases, and must come to have a recognizable 
specific character of their own, involving in their turn specific 
emphases within minor noetic systems ; and these, as we have 
seen in Chapter rv., are what are usually now-a-days spoken

of as “‘ feelings of relation,” or what I call ‘senses of rela- 
tion” ; concerning which it is unnecessary to speak at length 
except to refer the reader to Professor James’ Psychology 
(vol. i. p. 245), and especially to Professor R. S. Wood- 
worth’s notable essay* entitled The Consciousness of Relation. 
As a characteristic example of such senses of relation we 
may name that peculiar ‘‘feel” that we note whenever we 
deal with what we know as relative terms,” which always exist 
in pairs, e.g. father and son: husband and wife, etc., etc. 
The appreciation of one of the pair implies the other, and 
this involves a complex presentation of triple emphasis, in 
which appear the two specific ideas (e.g. father and son), and 
beyond this a further special form of relational emphasis 
which leads us to give each pair the specific name “related 
terms.” The noetic emphasis which we call the sense of 
likeness, of which we have spoken above, is also such a sense 
of relation of a very fundamental character. 
We have in fact such senses of relation bound up with the 
specific emphases which we describe as general notions. 
There is no such thing as a general image in the sense in 
which this is often conceived ; as Berkeley long ago taught, 
each image of a triangle, for instance, must be either right 
angled or oblique angled ; i.e. each so-called general image 
is really a single image, but its special character is given by 
the fact that it is one to which is attached a certain specific 
“sense of relation.” As Miss Calkins puts it,*® the ‘ gener- 
ality or conceptual character consists . . . merely in the 
addition of the feeling of generality to some element or 
combination.” 
As we shall see below, our percepts gain their specific 
character largely by the development in connection with them 
of one of these senses of relation, viz. the spatial relation.

Sec. 19. Concepts and senses of relations are naturally 
the most unlikely forms of presentations to hold attention. 
They correspond in our wave simile with combinational waves 
formed by the crossing and overlapping minor waves on the 
liquid surfaces considered; only when no influence results 
from beyond these combinational waves are they important 
in the production of the forms of the psychic emphasis within 
the noetic pattern of the moment. Thus it happens that 
we must exclude marked forms of sensations and percepts 
if attention is to be concentrated upon the flow of thought. 
We write in the quiet of the night ; we soften the light and 
insist upon silence in our libraries where we wish to think 
as we read. Where there is a contest in attention between 
sensation-perception on the one hand, and conceptual trains 
on the other, the sensation-percept always wins, unless one 
has especially trained oneself to cut away the sensational- 
perceptual effects. Indeed to do this persistently and effec- 
tively involves an artificial development which may become 
deeply morbid, as it appears in those whom we call ‘‘absent 
minded.” + 
We should expect trains of thought to be also easily dis- 
turbed by the instinct experiences which stand so close to 
sensations-percepts in degree of influence upon attention. 
And that this is realized in experience becomes clear when 
we consider how commonly our emotions override our 
1Jt is to be noted also that if we wish to follow a train of thought 
amidst distractions due to perceptual insistence we are wont deliberately to 
arouse special perceptual elements which are closely related to the thought 
elements to which we would give our attention, these former aiding us in 
overcoming the influence of the disturbing and unrelated percepts. Thus 
if, while we are adding a column of figures, we are disturbed by sensational 
and perceptual elements of conversation, we are wont to “add aloud ” as 
we say: that is we call to our aid sensational-perceptual elements which 
are obviously closely related to the thought elements of the moment, 
and thus are able to hold the latter in attention as we otherwise could 
not do,

thought trains, and how often they lead to the warping of 
the natural development of ratiocinative processes. 
Sec. 20. The above considerations involve a definite 
conclusion in relation to the question suggested in a pre- 
vious chapter where we asked whether our ideas are always 
secondary presentations of the type which we describe as 
recurrences. Our answer to this question from our present 
standpoint will be found to agree with that already given. 
The order of emphases discoverable in successive sensa- 
tions is to a great extent discoverable also in the realm of 
thought: for the movement of attention to ideational trains 
normally follows closely the order of sensational-perceptual 
experiences. But there are many instances where this evi- 
dently is not the case. When for example I attempt, as I am 
doing in this work, to describe systematically the nature of con- 
sciousness the sequence of ideas surely follows no order that 
has ever been given perceptually. And the more we consider 
the question the more does it appear clear that this sensational- 
perceptual order is seldom if ever exactly followed in the 
ideational realm: for although the movement of attention in 
the ideational realm does in some measure display an order 
corresponding with the sensational-perceptual order, never- 
theless above this order appear special forms of emphases not 
found in the sensational-perceptual order. 
We now also see the significance of the view maintained 
in Chapter v., viz. that each noetic pattern is necessarily a 
new and unique noetic pattern. If this is true, then each 
emphasis within each noetic pattern is also new and unique, 
and we should expect a priori to find noetic emphases which 
are in no sense sensational derivatives. As Stout says in 
relation to another question: + ‘‘ There is no absurdity in 
supposing a mode of presentational consciousness which is 
not composed of visual, auditory, tactual and other experi- 
ences derived from, and in some degree resembling in quality, 
1 Analytical Psychohgy, i. p. 93. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 121 
the sensations of the special senses.” I should state the case 
even more strongly, and should say that, in the light of intro- 
spection, and in consideration of what are to-day generally 
accepted psychological notions, there is every reason to say 
that such a view as the one here opposed is itself a very clear 
absurdity. 
B. Of the Spatial Quality. 
Sec. 21. Under certain conditions consciousness acquires 
a particular character due to the appearance of a special ‘‘ sense 
of relation” as an emphasis within experience, a sense of 
relation that involves the objective-subjective condition of 
reflection of which we have much to say in Book u. During 
the course of life a vast number of noetic patterns occur in 
which this sense of relation does not appear as an emphasis ; 
but whenever we assume the reflective state it does appear 
as a special qualification of the developed presentation which 
leads us to speak of it as objective,—as standing over against 
the rest of consciousness to which also attaches another special 
quality, which is often merely implicit, but which when it 
becomes explicit leads us to speak of this rest of consciousness 
as subjective. 
Of all the psychic emphases which have this broad quali- 
fication of objectiveness, as objects of reflection—of attention, 
—a very large proportion (but not all), at times acquire a more 
special qualification, due to the appearance of another special 
sense of relation which leads us in our developed life, to speak 
of them as “‘objects in the outer world,” and this special 
sense of relation upon which this complex form of thought is 
based I speak of as the spatial quality. 
The point here made is brought out clearly in the very fact 
that in speaking accurately of psychic emphases which have 
this spatial quality we always add to the word “‘ objects” the 
words “in the outer world,” to distinguish one special class 
of objects from objects of attention in general. The import 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
122 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
of this generally accepted distinction seems however to be 
commonly overlooked; for we find the realists of the day 
implicitly denying that the spatial qualification is a special 
qualification within the broader objective qualification, in the 
fact that they hold, as we shall see later, that all objects have 
in them at least the germ of this spatial quality. 
That the spatial qualification is a less general one than the 
objective qualification appears clear however when we con- 
sider that in reflection our sensations pure and simple; our 
reactive states, instinct experiences and emotions ; the cona- 
tive states, desire and impulse ; are never considered in any 
way as spatial; although each and all of them may be 
considered objectively, that is as objects of attention. They 
are never considered to be objects in the outer world, although 
they may be just as distinctly objectified psychic emphases 
within consciousness as are these objects in the outer world. 
‘Whenever objects in the outer world have prominence in our 
minds the psychic emphases above spoken of (sensations, 
reactive states, etc.), are always separated away from these 
objects in the outer world, the former when explicitly con- 
sidered being described as subjective rather than objective. 
As further instances of presentations which clearly have the 
objective but not the spatial qualification, we may mention 
such thoughts as “‘abstractness,” or ‘‘an hypothesis” ; such 
concepts as “‘consciousness” ; ‘‘God” as conceived by those 
who avoid anthropomorphic representations ; ‘‘ the Absolute.” 
Such universals as Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Value, are all 
thus considered as objective, although none of them is 
commonly thought of as in itself having position in space. 
In other words the spatial qualification cannot be properly 
spoken of as a special quality of the first order. It is not 
possible to say that psychic emphases of which this spatial ‘ 
1 According to Avenarius’ view for instance “nothing exists save experi- 
ence ; and the fundamental” characteristic of the content of experience is 
space.” Confer Norman Smith in Mind, N.S. 57, p. 14. 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
       OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 123 
quality is a characteristic are clearly separated away from all 
other psychic emphases as primary divisions in an orderly 
consideration of experience. Rather is it true that the spatial 
quality is a special quality of a tertiary order, so to speak: 
that is the psychic emphases of which this spatial quality is 
characteristic are a special class within a broader class of 
emphases of a second order, (viz. the objective order) ; which 
latter is not a general characteristic of all presentations, 
although it is one of the broadest generality. 
Sec. 22. The consideration of the nature of the spatial 
quality contained in the preceding sections would be sufficient 
for otr purpose but for the fact that the position thus main- 
tained apparently stands in opposition to views held by 
psychologists of great importance—e.g. such masters as 
James Ward, William James, and Stumpf, who hold that the 
“moment of spatiality” is an attribute or partial content of 
sensations. ‘‘ This material content” says Stout + ‘‘ is supplied 
by a character especially belonging to tactual and visual 
presentations, though it is shared also by organic, and possibly 
in a rudimentary way by other sensations. Extensity is a 
convenient name for this constituent of our experience of 
extension.” 
Dr. James Ward, who gave us the word extensity, was the 
pioneer in the field of investigation which has led to the 
adoption of this theory. He and his followers of course 
make a distinction between extension and extensity, but they 
all agree in treating this extensity as a “‘ material content” 
without which the notion of extension and of spatial forms 
would be impossible. Ward speaks of extensity as an 
“element of space,”* and James in his chapter on the 
Perception of Space in his Psychology says ‘‘that this element 
(extensity), discernible in each and every sensation, though 
more developed in some than in others, is the original sensa- 
tion of space.” :

-P-A-G-E-138
124 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
All this seems to point to the claim that the germ of spatial 
perception lies in a specific element of our sensational experi- 
ence rather than in our appreciation of a special sense of 
relation within the emphasis in which appears the more general 
qualification of objectiveness. It may be that those who 
defend the theory thus criticised would find it not incom- 
patible with an acceptance of the view here upheld; but it 
seems to me that if this is so their language is often mis- 
leading, and I think it worth while to present certain 
objections to the view thus apparently maintained. 
Sec. 23. In the first place it seems clear that it is not 
necessary to assume the existence of such a “‘ material content” 
in sensation in order to explain the spatial qualification. It 
is as simple to assume the appearance under certain conditions 
of a newly formed combinational ‘‘ sense of relation,” i.e. the 
spatial relation,—which is involved with the coincidence of 
special minor psychic emphases which may be either of sensa- 
tional or of other types: for the spatial quality is surely not 
limited to the realm of sensation, as is clear in the fact that 
many concepts are spatially qualified. The difference between 
superficial and three dimensional space notions is well held 
by Dr. Judd?! to be “‘not a new content; it is a form in 
which the contradiction between the dimension attributes of 
the two groups of sensations is eliminated.” ‘‘ The common 
factor is not a concrete factor, but it is a relation.” And if 
this is true it is as simple to hold that the more elementary 
spatial notion is due to a special “‘ sense of relation.” In fact 
Prof. James? implies as much where in reply to a critic he 
says “‘no one would seriously pretend that the distance 
(between two sounds) was a sound like that of the notes 
themselves. Most people would call it a relation intellec- 
tually and not sensibly apprehended.” If we must resort to 
such a sense of relation to explain the “‘distance” between 
1 Psychological Review, v. 4, pp. 396 fF. 
2 Mind, N.S. 7, p. 364 (italics mine). 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 125 
sounds, why cannot we explain in the same way the distance 
appreciated through the field of vision, even if in this latter case 
“the distance is a thing seen?” What right have we to say 
that in this case it is not a relation apprehended merely 
intellectually? And beyond this if the resort to the appre- 
hension of a relation is allowable in any case, as James says it 
is in the case of sounds, why may we not have in it also the 
basis for the development of the notion of spatial attributes, 
not only in the realm of sensation, but in conceptual realms 
as well? 
Dr. James Ward? tells us ‘‘this much (extensity of sensa- 
tion) we may allow is original; for . . . we see that no 
combination or association of sensations varying only in 
intensity and quality, not even if motor presentations are 
added, will account for the space element in our perceptions.” 
But it appears to me that we might as well hold that the 
thought “ derween a and 6” involves the existence of some 
original elementary quality which we may call ‘‘ betweenness” 
in both the original a and in the original b. In my view, in 
the appreciation of extensity, and also of betweenness, we 
are dealing with different kinds of ‘‘ senses of relation” which 
arise when diverse elements are coincidently emphasized, and 
which do not appear unless these diverse elements are thus 
emphasized. At all events it appears to me that the view 
here taken is adequate to explain the facts, and is not open to 
the objections here noted. 
Sec. 24. If the view as to the nature of our appreciation 
of space as held by the masters above referred to is incorrect, 
some suggestion as to the source of their error would seem to 
be called for; and this I find in a failure to make a clear dis- 
tinction between the general quality which I call manifoldness,? 
and the quality of extensity which they claim to have dis- 
covered in sensations. The psychologists who uphold the 
1 Encyclopedia Britannica, Article “ Psychology,” p. 53. 
2 Confer Book 11. Chapter rx. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
126 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
extensity theory have called attention to facts which leave no 
doubt that each presentation observable in reflection is com- 
plex, is an emphasis in which minor emphases appear, t.e. that 
the very simplest of psychic emphases, viz. our sensations, 
display some measure of manifoldness. And it is very easy 
for one who is looking to introspection for corroboration of 
the extensity theory to mistake this manifoldness for the 
extensity for which on a priori grounds he is looking. 
It may be agreed, as we shall see in a later chapter, that 
manifoldness is a general quality discoverable in connection 
with all psychic emphases; but clearly the spatial quality is 
not such a general quality, for we discover certain presenta- 
tions which are not spatially qualified. If manifoldness is a 
general quality it must to be sure be appreciable whenever the 
appearance of the special spatial quality is distinct, but this 
latter may best be looked upon as a quality which is deter- 
mined by the coincidence of certain elementary forms within 
the field in which manifoldness is appreciable. 
Sec. 25. By the relating together and the coordination of 
the great body of psychic emphases to which is attached the 
spatial relation we men gain the conceptions of extension, of 
the outer world, and of space itself. The study of the means 
by which these conceptions are developed has, as the reader 
knows, occupied the attention of the foremost thinkers in the 
past, and is still the subject of much minute and careful study. 
It would carry us far beyond the limits of this work to attempt 
even to summarize the results of these studies and no attempt 
will be made to do so. 
‘We may note however that much has been made in late 
writings of the intrinsic social reference of all our notions of 
the physical world, that is of the world outside of us in space. 
That the spatial quality which we are here considering is a 
very special sense of relation is in truth clearly shown in the 
fact that in some way or other it is especially bound up with 
the recognition of the existence of other human individuals 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
        OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 127 
than ourselves, and with a notion that the experiences of these 
other selves correspond with ours. To take an example sug- 
gested by Prof. Royce; the rainbow is thought of by the 
uninstructed man as part of the outer world of objects, like 
the falling rain or the sun in conjunction with which it 
appears ; but as soon as I recognize that each man’s rainbow 
is a special rainbow, as appears clear as the result of the teach- 
ings of science, and of careful study of the location of several 
men’s rainbows in relation to fixed objects in the landscape ; 
then at once all emphasis of the spatial quality is lost,1— 
then at once I think of the rainbow as an experience of 
mine, as contrasted with, and not as an object in, the outer 
world. 
Nevertheless it may well be true that this special spatial 
relation is bound up with the very intricate and complex 
relation in which my consciousness stands with other con- 
ceived consciousnesses, and yet not true that this recognition 
of other consciousnesses is of the essence of the spatial 
quality with which is bound up our appreciation of objects in 
the outer world ; and I cannot feel that the evidence warrants 
us in going so far as Prof. Royce? for instance does, in holding 
that ‘‘it is social community that is the true differentia of our 
external world” ; or in holding with Miss Calkins, that ‘‘ the 
external world is the world of society as opposed to the world 
of the lonely self” of the imagination.* In taking such a 
position one is surely examining a special case of a highly 
complex nature not the simple cases of every day experience. 
There is one fact which goes a long way to warrant 
our hesitancy in accepting the doctrine here considered. 
1 Introspective examination compels me to deny that the spatial quality 
disappears altogether. 
2 Philosophical Review, Sept. 1894, p. 530. 
3 Miss Calkins herself points out that imagining is “indirectly . . . a social 
experience, as the denial that it belongs to others is a recognition of their 
existence” (9. cit. p. 189).   
    
  
  
-P-A-G-E-142
128 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Thoughts, and certain conceptions (as for instance the theory 
of the origin of species), are appreciated as involving their 
recognition by other selves than our own, they are looked 
upon as public property just as much as are objects in the 
outer world; but surely the common man does not think 
of these thoughts and concepts as objects in the outer world 
as he should do if the theory above referred to were correct ; 
for just so far as they are appreciated as public property they 
appear to belong to all of us, and hence should under the 
theory here considered be spatially qualified as belonging to 
the external world. Boris Sidis ' agrees that a ‘‘ percept is not 
experienced as external because it is common to other 
people” ; and we may note with him that ‘‘an hallucination 
is as fully a percept and is perceived in the full garb of 
external reality, although it may have no currency with my 
fellow men. The percept possesses the co-efficient of external 
reality, no matter whether or no others can share in it.” 
That the bond between the external world qualification 
and the appreciation of the existence of other selves is strong 
however, as we have already agreed, is made very evident in 
the fact that early Realists clearly did tend to give an object- 
in-the-outer world qualification to their concepts, and that the 
common man continues to do so in relation to such concepts 
as Beauty, Goodness and Truth. 
I am willing to agree that as things are constituted the 
social relation is of the utmost importance in the constitution 
of my notions of externality: but there seems to me to be 
every reason for holding that if I were the only man living, 
or who had ever lived, and were fully developed intellectually, 
I would now perceive objects as ‘‘in an outer world”; and 
1 Psychological Review, xv. 2, p. 119. We may agree with this statement 
in relation to hallucinations without accepting Mr. Sidis’ view (p. 120) 
“that we perceive the flower as an external reality simply and solely 
because it is sensory... External reality is given directly and immediately 
by the sensation or by the sensory compound, by the percept.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
      OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 129 
that in the main they would then have for me spatial qualifica- 
tions substantially of the form existing for me as a social 
being. 
IV. Tue Inureitive States. 
Sec. 26. As we have already seen each noetic emphasis 
has a conative aspect in that it involves a movement beyond 
itself. Thus to each noetic emphasis or presentation belongs 
a natural form of development. We shall here consider cer- 
tain more or less general forms of presentations which are 
determined by the inhibition of this natural development of 
noetic emphases. 
These emphases in their very nature must involve complex 
minor emphases, among which must appear prominent (1) an 
emphasis of the presentation the development of which is in- 
hibited, and (2) a broad systemic emphasis corresponding with 
the reactions accompanying the effort of the system to break 
down the obstruction to the natural development of the em- 
phasis inhibited. This latter broad systemic psychic emphasis 
or presentation must be of the nature of instinct experience : 
and as our emotions are instinct experiences we should expect 
to find ourselves naturally tempted often to class these inhibi- 
tive states as emotional; at other times again we might be 
expected to take especial note of their conative aspect referred 
to in the opening paragraph of this section. As we shall see 
in what follows these modes of classification of the inhibitive 
states are very common. 
A. Impulse. 
Sec. 27. Asa matter of convenience we may consider first 
the presentations determined by the inhibition of instinct 
actions. 
We act instinctively during our daily life usually without 
paying any attention to the instinct experiences corresponding 
I 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
130 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
with the instinctive acts: but at certain times, when for one 
reason or another a natural instinct action is inhibited, there 
occurs an emphasis in consciousness which we designate as an 
impulse. 
If I am suddenly confronted with a snake in my path, and 
quickly strike at it with my golf club, I appreciate the instinct 
experience which accompanies the instinct action. But if I 
am prevented from striking by the pressure on my arm of 
the strap of my bag, or by the restraining hand of my friend, 
or even by the words of my friend who calls out “don’t kill 
the poor thing, it is harmless ;”—then I experience what I 
call an impulse to strike. 
This example gives a clear cut case: but there are cases 
where the activity which is inhibited is less clear and broadly 
diffused and which we speak of as blind impulses (Triebe) or 
as cravings, as they shade away from the nature of clearly 
defined impulses. This means that certain of the states due 
to inhibited instinct actions, i.e. the cravings, do not involve 
any marked emphasis of (1) the inhibited presentation referred 
to in the second paragraph of Section 26 ; that others, i.e. the 
1Confer my Instinct and Reason, pp. 341 to 344. The word impulse 
is used by those concerned with the mechanical sciences to refer to mere 
mechanical impact. This is unfortunate for the psychologist, for the 
word has gained an established currency in psychological and ethical 
writings to refer to a specific form of conscious experience, and no little 
confusion arises among writers in these latter fields in consequence of 
the mechanical connotations of the term. It is thus that we often 
carelessly use the word impulse, with a quasi-mechanical connotation, 
in place of the word instinct. Men often speak of acting impulsively, 
when they mean that they act instinctively, intending also to suggest 
that they act “automatically” in the sense of mechanically. Where 
we use the word impulse in what follows we must be understood to 
refer exclusively to that state of experience to which the introspective- 
psychologist refers when he uses the term. 
As the result of further consideration I have become convinced that 
my use of terms, and my analysis in reference to this subject, as given 
in my earlier works was in some particulars faulty. Where differences 
appear I prefer to be judged by my present statement. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
         
  OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 131 
clear impulses, do involve a marked emphasis of the inhibited 
presentation ; and that there is a class between the two, i.e. 
blind impulses, in connection with which this inhibited pre- 
sentation is overlooked, although very easily discerned in 
reflection. In other words the impulses have clearly defined 
objects, while the cravings as clearly have not. 
Physiological consideration has taught us that cravings 
may be produced by the mere deprivation of a stimulus to 
activity which is usually somewhat rhythmically recurrent : the         
    
                
  stimulation to activity in the digestive organs and their 
related parts which is given as the result of the process of 
eating, if not recurrent in its normal rhythm, gives us the 
craving of hunger. Or cravings may arise where systemic 
development, determined by heredity, brings capacity to act 
in combinations of organs which fail to act only because they 
await an unexperienced stimulus: the most notable instance 
of this type is given in the sexual cravings which arise with 
the approach of the age of puberty. 
The relation of the cravings to the instincts becomes clear 
when we consider that as certain of our instincts are congenital 
and others deferred, so certain of our cravings are congenital 
(e.g. hunger and thirst) while others are deferred (e.g. the 
sexual cravings). 
The psychic elements distinguishable in these cravings 
consist of broadly systemic painful elements coupled with 
what we call a sense of uneasiness, which latter may be sup- 
posed to be the psychic counterpart of the tendencies of 
accumulated, yet restricted, energy to work itself off, if we 
may so speak, in channels that are free, and which may lead 
indirectly to activities resulting in the satisfaction of the 
craving. ‘The painfulness is due to the mere restriction ; for 
all restriction of activity for which we are prepared, and which 
is either directly or indirectly stimulated, is painful. 
Whenever the instinct action which would develope were 
the inhibition removed appears in any measure clear as a 
           
                                                
-P-A-G-E-146
132 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
presentation, then the craving developes into an impulse of a 
corresponding measure of clearness. The vague cravings of 
hunger develope into impulses to grasp food and to eat. 
Prof. James has brought out clearly the relation of impulse 
to instinct in his chapter on Justinct in his large Psychology. 
In my view however he had been led, by the use of current 
terms as referred to in the footnote Section 27, to an inaccurate 
statement where he says (vol. ii. p. 385) ‘“ Every instinct is an 
impulse.” The relation between instinct and impulse is in 
my view more correctly stated if we say that each impulse 
implies the existence of an instinct, and that the existence of 
an instinct implies the possibility of the appearance of an 
impulse if the proper conditions are given. 
Sec. 28. As we should expect from what has been said at 
the close of Section 26, we find a common agreement among 
psychologists that our cravings and impulses are of a conative 
nature. But, as we should also expect, we find ourselves 
naturally including our impulsive with our emotional states 
when we do not stop to make careful classifications. 
B. Desire-Aversion. 
Sec. 29. If the substance of the preceding sections is true 
then we might expect to find within the coordinative states, 
i.e. within the realm of ideas, certain presentations closely 
related to the impulses ;—that is we might expect to note 
the appearance of states closely related to the impulses where 
the development of specific ideas is inhibited. 
Now the inhibition of the development of one idea by the 
development of an incompatible idea is the commonest of 
our every day experiences, and one which for the most part 
passes unnoticed. But where the inhibition is maintained 
for a sufficient length of time to enable us to reflect upon the 
two incompatible ideas, then the incompatibility brings into 
prominence the failure of realness in each of the ideas, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 133 
we have the condition of doubt, to which we refer more fully 
later. 
But we have a specially interesting case where such an 
inhibition developes a presentation of multiple emphasis 
in which appears an idea as realizable, and yet as not 
realized. 
In such a case if the emphasis is upon the possible realiza- 
tion of the idea in the future, and if no action of the 
empirical ego is explicit, we have what we call mere anticipa- 
tion ; in which case the unrealized idea developes as though it 
were realized. And when we explicitly recognize the em- 
pirical ego as bound up with the realness of this idea to which 
futureness belongs we have as we see in Book 11. what we 
call expectation. 
When the expectation is inhibited we experience a special 
painful experience of an emotional nature which we call a 
disappointment. 
Sec. 30. But a very special form is given to the psychic 
emphasis of the moment when the empirical ego is appre- 
hended as welcoming the realization of the idea which is 
recognized to be at present unrealized; and this gives us 
what we call desire. 
Another very special form is given to the emphasis when 
the empirical ego is recognized as rejecting the realization of 
the at present unrealized idea ; and this gives us what we call 
aversion. 
It is clear from the above that a very close relationship 
exists between expectation on the one hand, and desire and 
aversion on the other, to which I refer below. 
Where the realization of the idea is recognized as possible 
under certain conditions which cannot at the moment exist, 
then what would otherwise be a desire becomes a wish. 
The nature of desire-aversion is so important to ethical 
theory that it seems worth while to consider its nature some- 
what at length. 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
134 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
Sec. 31. If what we have said above is true, desire 
appears to be a complex emphasis which always contains three 
elements : 
A. A painful emphasis due to systemic obstruction, of 
effort by the system to force channels for the ‘‘pent up 
stream of action” (Ward), using the word action in the 
broadest way ; i.e. of effort to get around the restriction to the 
realization ; which painful emphasis is of the nature of a 
craving: and 
B. A persistent image of the realization of an unrealized 
objective idea. We learn by reflection that if this idea were 
realized the result would be the relief of the desire painful- 
ness; but neither this act of reflection nor its outcome is 
necessary to the desire. 
C. To this is added, in all cases where desire is clear and 
explicit, the appreciation of the welcome by the empirical ego 
of the realization of the unrealized idea. This appreciation 
of the action of the empirical ego in desire is not always 
clearly explicit. 
Aversion on the other hand appears to be a complex 
emphasis which always contains three elements. 
a. A painful emphasis due to systemic obstruction, as 
above described : 
8. A persistent image of the realization of an unrealized 
objective idea; and 
y. The appreciation of the rejection by the empirical ego 
of the realization of the unrealized idea ; which appreciation 
is not always clearly explicit. 
Both desire and aversion thus involve in the persistent 
image of an unrealized idea the marked emphasis (1) of 
the inhibited presentation which is commonly spoken of as 
the object of the desire or of the aversion. 
Sec. 32. As we have seen in Section 26, we should 
expect to find conative and also emotional characteristics 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
    
         OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 135 
attributed to desire-aversion, and that this expectation is 
met I think will be granted. 
In this connection it may be well to say a few words in 
regard to the relation between desire and aversion and our 
emotional states. Desire whenever it works itself out does 
so in the direction of love ; and aversion whenever it works 
itself out does so in the direction of hate in its milder or 
stronger forms: and this is so common an occurrence that the 
common man is wont to identify desire with love, and aver- 
sion with hate. In revulsion from this inaccurate view of 
the common man which has had too careless a following 
among psychologists, I have been led in my earlier works to 
make a stronger distinction between the states of desire and 
aversion on the one hand, and longing and hatred on the 
other, than I now think warranted.* 
When desires and aversions are satisfied the inhibition is 
removed, and the natural result is the occurrence of instinct 
actions, and their corresponding instinct experiences, of which 
as we have seen emotions are a special type. It is natural 
therefore that the close relation between our emotional states 
on the one hand, and desires and aversions on the other, 
should have led to a failure to differentiate the two classes 
of experiences. 
But that emotion is not of the essence of desire and aver- 
sion is clear in the fact that while most of our experiences of 
desire and aversion have a distinct emotional tinge, such is 
not always the case. Desire for knowledge, aversion to vice, 
for instance have little if any emotional attachments. 
Sec. 33. The definition which I have above given of desire 
stands in opposition to that given by a large number of our 
psychological masters who have held that the appreciation of 
pleasure to be obtained in the realization of the idea is of the 
very essence of desire. The question as to whether the 
1Cf my Instinct and Reason, pp. 352 and 353, where I used the term 
aversion as descriptive of the fully developed emotional state. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
136 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
existence of an appreciation of pain to be avoided is of the 
essence of aversion has for the most part been passed over 
without discussion ;! but we shall find it convenient to con- 
sider this also. We may turn then to the discussion of the 
relation of pleasure and pain to desire and to aversion. 
Turning our thoughts in the first place to the relation of 
desire to pain and pleasure it may be noted that practically all 
psychologists agree that there is a sense of tension (which 
necessarily involves a measure of pain) in both desire and 
aversion ; although certain writers, in their ardent defense of 
the importance to desire of the appreciation of pleasure to 
be gained by the realization of the idea, have minimized, 
or even overlooked altogether, the presence of this painful 
tension in desire. 
Not a few psychologists, however, especially among the 
Germans, have held that this sense of tension is the only 
essential element in desire. But this view cannot be main- 
tained without identifying expectation and desire, which 
certain writers have indeed not hesitated to do in the interest 
of the defense of their doctrines. But the fact that we often 
expect what we do not desire, and often desire what we do 
not expect, of course negatives this notion.’ 
Sec. 34. The most important point for our consideration 
in this connection however is the relation of desire to 
pleasure. 
It must be granted in the first place that the’ satisfaction 
of a desire always gives pleasure, for the removal of an 
inhibition always involves a free activity which carries 
pleasure with it. It must also be agreed that the idea of 
pleasure to be gained must necessarily thus very often become 
1 And this notwithstanding that aversion is often spoken of as a positive 
state closely allied with desire. Confer Bradley, Mind, xlix. pp. 21 and 22. 
2Confer Bradley, Mind, xlix. p. 16. Bradley in my View is right in 
his opposition to this position : but as I shall presently attempt to show is 
wrong in his explanation of the difference between expectation and desire. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
      
       OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 137 
closely attached to the object of desire. But that the idea 
of the pleasure to be gained in the satisfaction is of the essence 
of desire I think cannot be maintained. In this view I stand 
in opposition to a great’band of notable psychologists. But 
it may be modestly held that even eminent thinkers may have 
misinterpreted their introspection, and may have been led 
astray by the fact above mentioned that, as the satisfaction of 
desire always gives pleasure, the idea of pleasure to be gained 
must necessarily usually become closely attached to the object 
of desire. 
One who takes my position finds encouragement however 
when he notes that Hume? is on his side, and that John 
Stuart Mill* also saw this point clearly, and after allowing 
for all arguments to the contrary called attention to the fact 
that “‘it is at least certain that we gradually, through the 
influence of association, come to desire the means without 
thinking of the end ; that action itself becomes an object of 
desire.” If it is allowed that there is one single exception 
to the rule the case must be judged in favor of the side I 
uphold. But the case is made clear in my view in the fact 
acknowledged by Sully * although in a somewhat regretful 
way, “that we desire many things, e.g. knowledge, virtue, 
other’s happiness, without at the moment thinking of the 
attainment of the objects as pleasure-yielding.” Unless 
some denial of this fact is forthcoming it seems little else 
than absurd to persist in the reiteration of the view here 
opposed. It were more to the point to attempt to account 
for the ground upon which it has been held, and to explain 
the nature of desire without dependence upon it.

Waitz, Lehmann, and F. H. Bradley. Confer my Pain, Pleasure, and

138 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
It is true of course that what we call the realization of 
pleasure may be, and very often is, the object of desire; 
although I would hold that this is not invariably the case. 
But it must be remembered that this object of desire which 
we call a pleasure is always an idea of a pleasant something, 
a pleasant act or sensation, for instance ; and that such an 
idea is not a “ represented ” pleasure’ (for a pleasure as such 
can only be a quality of the given moment’s experience), but 
is an idea of something to which the word or thought 
“pleasure” has become closely attached ; and this “‘ pleasure 
idea” as a present experience may be pleasant, but on the 
other hand it may not be. 
Sec. 35. Turning now to the relation of aversion to 
pleasure-pain we may note again that here as in the case of 
desire there is a tension which must be painful in some degree. 
Beyond that we must grant that if an object of aversion is 
realized it will usually bring pain in its realization. But it 
is too much to hold that in aversion we always necessarily 
have before us an idea of a pain which is unrealized, in view 
of the fact that we have aversion for many things, e.g. 
ignorance, vice, the unhappiness of others, without at the 
moment thinking of the realization of the objects as pain 
giving. But this point is not insisted upon even by those 
who claim that the object of desire is a pleasure which is 
unrealized, although it would appear that such a claim should 
be made by the defenders of this latter notion if they are to 
1As I have said in my Instinct and Reason, p. 541, we can no more have 
a revival of a pleasure apart from a content which is pleasant, than we 
can have a revival of an intensity without a somewhat that is intense, or a 
revival of a special degree of realness without a somewhat that is real. So 
far as we think of pleasure, and of intensity, and of realness, except as 
attached to some “content,” we are not considering the experienced 
qualities themselves, but abstractions,—ideas of pleasure, of intensity, of 
realness, which are themselves “ 
of intensity, realness, and pleasure or pain. Confer further o. cit. pp. 542 
and 543 ff. contents ” which have as such some measure

be logical: the weakness of their view is again shown in 
the fact that they must close their eyes to this very evident 
fact if they are to maintain their position. 
It is true of course that what we call the realization of 
pain may be, and very often is, the object of aversion. But 
it must be remembered that this object of aversion which we 
call a pain is always an idea of a painful somewhat,—a painful 
act or sensation, for instance ; and that such an idea is not a 
‘‘represented” pain (for a pain as such can only be a quality 
of the given moment’s experience), but is an idea of some- 
thing to which the word or thought ‘‘pain” has become 
closely attached ; and this ‘‘ pain idea” as a present experi- 
ence may be painful, but on the other hand it may not 
be. The “‘idea” of the pain attending the reduction of my 
dislocated shoulder some years ago, as occurring in to-day’s 
remembrance, is not in the least a painful experience. 
Sec. 36. Let us now consider for a moment the relation 
between expectation, and desire and aversion. Desire, as we 
have seen, is identified with expectation by those who would 
make the sense of tension the essence of desire. But Mr. 
Bradley is certainly right in holding’ that something must 
be added to this tension if we are to have desire, although 
in my view he is wrong in thinking it is merely the idea of 
pleasure that is added. In this connection we may note that, 
strange as it may appear, we find little said by writers upon this 
subject concerning the relation of expectation to aversion 
which is so evidently correllated with desire. 
The basis of the connection between both desire-aversion 
and impulse, and expectation, is found in the fact that in 
desire-aversion and in impulse we have more or less clearly 
developed the conative aspect of presentations (see’ below) : 
that is to say we here evidently have an emphasis of what we 
call the spontaneity of the psychic system which as we see in 
Book 1. naturally tends to induce an emphasis of developing 
1 Mind, xlix. p. 16.
-P-A-G-E-154
        140 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
complexity, and therefore a sense of futureness, within the 
presentative field. And this sense of futureness will often 
gain a relative stability or realness as the result of this systemic 
spontaneity which will result in the appearance of clear cut 
cases of expectation. This accords with the experience of 
every man: for we all realize how far our desires influence 
our hopes! and our expectations; and that our impulses 
have a forward—a future—trend is also apparent. 
The basis of the distinction between both desire and 
aversion, and expectation, seems clear. In expectation we 
have, as we have seen, realness given to the presentation 
which is real by its attachment to,—its partial assimilation 
by—the empirical ego; but where we do not have either 
desire or aversion, and do have expectation, the future real- 
ness appears as forced upon us without regard to the welcome 
or rejection of this realness by the empirical ego. 
In desire and aversion we have an explicit sense of tension. 
But in mere expectation the tension is not emphatic; for 
while it exists in a degree it is not enforced by the opposition 
of the emphasis of the fact that the idea to be realized is 
not realized: and it is further lessened by the relatively free 
unfolding of the idea in imagination as we say; the idea 
developes its relations almost as if it were actually realized. 
When the tension is brought into existence by the recognition 
that the idea is not realizable, then expectation gives place 
to disappointment. 
But in desire, and also in aversion, this tension is increased 
by the presence in attention of the opposition between the 
idea as possible of realization and yet as not realized; and 
to this is added the welcome or the rejection respectively by 
the empirical ego. 
1 Hope is a state of vibration between expectation and non-expectation. 
Its emotional quality is determined by the alternative spontaneous reactions 
and repressions which are involved, giving us experiences respectively of 
elation and depression.
-P-A-G-E-155
    
           OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 141 
It thus happens that what we expect we may also desire 
or have an aversion for, when in a transition of thought the 
welcome or rejection of the idea becomes manifest. But we 
may also expect that for which we have neither desire nor 
aversion: and so also we may desire what we do or do not 
expect: the desire being determined by the appreciation of the 
welcome of the realization of the unrealized idea by the em- 
pirical ego, which may or may not exist. And in many 
cases this action of the empirical ego is effective in producing 
so great a measure of realness in the idea still unrealized 
that the tension is removed, and the unrealized idea developes 
as it does in expectation. It is thus that our desires often 
lead us to quite unwarranted expectations. 
And correspondingly it happens that we may have an 
aversion for what we expect, and also for what we do not 
expect ; the aversion being determined by the appreciation 
of the rejection of the realization of the unrealized idea by 
the empirical ego. And in many cases this action of the 
empirical ego is effective in producing so great a diminution 
of realness in an idea which is about to be realized that we 
come to lose all such expectation as would normally be 
developed in connection with the idea. It is easy for instance 
for a man who knows that he has a mortal disease to disregard 
all his symptoms of decline and to refuse to expect death. 
It is true that expectation easily passes into desire; but 
it is to be noted that it as easily passes into aversion. And 
it is true that the thought of the pleasure to be gained may 
bring about the welcome by the empirical ego which con- 
stitutes the state one of desire; but this welcome, as we 
have seen, may be otherwise induced. And it is true that 
the thought of pain to be gained may bring about the rejec- 
tion by the empirical ego which constitutes the state one of 
aversion ; but this rejection, as we have also seen, may be 
otherwise induced.

        OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
C. The Will Act. 
Sec. 37. We have spoken above of desire-aversion and 
impulse as conative states, and although this subject will be 
more fully considered in Book 11. it seems necessary to say 
a few words here in relation to conation in general in order 
to make clear the nature of that most marked of our reactive 
states the act of will. 
Our conative experience may be described as a special form 
of psychic emphasis due to the struggle to overcome the 
inhibition of the free movement from stimulation to reaction, 
in whatever part of the psychic system it may be emphasized 
as the result of the inhibition. In a complex system of 
systems, such as is the great neural system in man, there 
can seldom arise any marked activity which is not more or 
less inhibited : hence, if the above statement is correct, corre- 
spondingly in consciousness we should expect to experience 
very broadly the special differential state which we know 
as conation ; and that this is a fact is attested by the general 
conviction in the minds of modern philosophers of the wide 
spread occurrence of conative experience. 
Conation is often spoken of as will. But such a use of 
terms is to be deplored as it often leads to misunderstanding. 
‘For the average man when he thinks of will thinks of some 
specific will act as we call it,—some volitional experience,— 
of which we shall presently speak. 
Sec. 38. Desire-aversion and impulse inhibitions may 
be broken down by the natural enforcement of the idea in 
the case of desire or aversion, or of the instinct experience 
in the case of impulse. Then we gain quite naturally the 
satisfaction of the desire or relief from the aversion, or we 
act as impelled by the instinct. 
This outcome must often be due to the enforcement of 
idea or instinct experience by the implicit efficiency of the 
psychic system. When this becomes explicit then we will
-P-A-G-E-157
  OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 143 
gain a recognition of the presented empirical ego as efficient 
in giving the satisfaction of desire or the relief from aversion, 
or in performing the instinctive act. 
The desire case is here closely allied with situations where 
there is the mere appreciation of the inhibition of the 
development of an idea, and of the forcing of this develop- 
ment by the system as explicit in the empirical ego, in which 
situations we appreciate the sense of effort in attending, of 
which we speak more at length in Book mt. 
Sec. 39. Let us for the moment treat of impulse apart 
from desire-aversion. The inhibition which brings the 
impulse into existence may be caused by objective opposition ; 
as in the restraining of the instinct action, in the example 
given above, by the hand of my friend upon my arm, or 
even indirectly by his spoken word. Or the inhibition may 
be due to the appearance of tendencies to the development 
of two incompatible instinct actions, and then we experience 
two opposed impulses. It is in connection with this type 
of inhibition that our impulses become most marked. 
If in such cases one of the tendencies naturally developes 
more power than the other; then one impulse is carried out 
into its appropriate instinct action, and in that fact the impulse 
related to this instinct action disappears as such, being replaced 
by the instinct experience corresponding with the instinct 
action: the other impulse of inferior power remains, pro- 
testing for a time perhaps against its conqueror, but in most 
cases being lost as a psychic emphasis as the result of the 
development of the noetic patterns resultant from the effec- 
tive instinct action. 
Thus at this moment if I stop to think of the exhilarating 
morning air I find aroused in me two incompatible impulses, 
one pointing to a long cross-country walk, the other to the 
work involved in the revision of this chapter. The tendency 
to continue my writing prevails, and the impulse to write 
this sentence disappears in the fact that I am thinking and 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
144 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
writing ; it is replaced by the moderately pleasant activities 
connected with this thinking and writing. The impulse to 
take my long walk on the other hand remains noticeable in 
the background of the field of attention as I now write, but 
it will soon fade away as my writing and reading engrosses 
me. 
Sec. 40. When the two incompatible impulses remain 
balanced because the tendencies to the development of each 
of the incompatible instinct actions is closely balanced, we 
have the deadlock of hesitancy. When this neururgic 
deadlock is broken by some influence coming from the 
undifferentiable mass within the neururgic system, then on 
the psychic side we have the deadlock broken by some 
influence from the Self: and, when this influence becomes 
explicit, we experience the efficiency of the empirical ego in 
making one of the opposed instinctive tendencies effective. 
When this experience carries with it an idea anticipatory of 
the act to result from the resolution of the deadlock, then 
we call it a volitional act, or an act of will: we act voluntarily 
when, having in mind the diverse acts which will result from 
the submission to the two opposed incompatible impulses, 
the empirical ego welcomes the one and at the same time 
rejects the other. 
Sec. 41. In the action of the neural system coincident 
normally with the act of will in relation to impulse we have 
the development of relatively violent instinct actions; and 
therefore we should expect to find in such acts of will an 
emphasis of those elements of attention which we have found 
to be characteristic of our instinct experiences in general. 
In other words in moments of analysis of our volitional 
reaction, as is the case with instinct actions in general, we 
should expect to find our attention fixed upon the sensational 
elements due to reactions of the system, as these reactions 
affect the system as a whole: that is we should expect to 
find the elements of attention in an act of will closely allied 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
             OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 145 
     to those which have led to the emphasis of the “ back stroke” 
by James and Lange in reference to emotion. That this 
expectation is realized is of course clear ; for it is upon this 
emphasis that depends the theory of will which has found 
so notable an exponent in Dr. James, who identifies the 
“psychic state which is the forerunner of our voluntary acts” 
with the ‘‘anticipatory image of the sensorial consequence 
of a movement, plus (on certain occasions) the fiat that these 
consequences shall become actual” ; and who identifies the 
sense of willing with those sensational effects which we call 
our “‘feelings of effort.” 
In this the reader will note that I find but a partially correct 
view. The ‘‘feelings of effort” are in truth the most 
emphatic elements of attention in the impulsive volitional act ; 
they do not however appear clearly sensorial in the realm of 
desire-aversion ; a fact that seems to be overlooked by the 
defenders of the doctrine criticized. Here,as inall moments of 
our conscious life, we are dealing with the coincident of the 
total throb of the psychic system which determines the nature 
of the presentation of the moment. 
Sec. 42. If what we have said above is correct then we 
should expect to note with equal clearness that desires or 
aversions are most clearly observed when two incompatible 
desires or aversions appear; and we should also expect to 
note as close a relation between desire-aversion and the will 
act as we have noted between impulse and the will act. 
In the case of both desire-aversion and the will act the 
welcome or rejection by the empirical ego is involved; but 
in the case of the will act there is a contest between incom- 
patibles, and a clear anticipatory idea of a change of situation, 
which is not present in desire-aversion. The latter however 
quite naturally often leads to volitional acts. 
As we have already indicated the character of the will 
act in relation to conflicting impulses in the preceding sec- 
tions we need not here enlarge upon its like character in

-P-A-G-E-160
146 OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN GENERAL 
relation to conflicting desires or aversions, especially as we 
shall discuss the whole matter when we consider the 
nature of the empirical ego in Book mz. In general we 
may say that the act of will is a special form of experi- 
ence that arises when there is an opposition of two 
incompatible ideas, desires-aversions, or impulses, each of 
which inhibits the development of the other. The will act 
is the rejection of the one and the welcome of the other of 
the two incompatibles by the empirical ego. ‘We may 
speak” as Bradley says ‘‘of a permanent or standing will 
for a certain end, and may talk as if it existed there where at 
the moment no actual volition is present.” But in such 
cases we are speaking of conditions or characteristics which 
appear in an objective view and are not referring to subjective 
experience. As we shall see below we speak very much in 
the same way of objectively noted conditions of stability, 
which we are wont to call beliefs when they are merely con- 
ditions which are liable to produce beliefs. 
There is in fact no such thing as a human will that chooses, 
it being altogether as proper, as Locke” says, to say that “ the 
singing faculty sings, and the dancing faculty dances, as that 
the will chooses.” What exists is conative experience in 
general, and, as a special case of this conative experience, 
the will act. 
The act of will, and voluntary action, are descriptive terms 
for one and the same experience. The act of will would be 
impossible but for the inhibition which produces the emphatic 
conative experience. It is due to the fact that this inhibition 
is effective to produce a momentary balance and cessation of 
reaction, which balance is broken by the increase of efficiency 
in some of the elements which are stimulated to action within 
the complex system, this increase of efficiency being due to 
influence arising not within the field of attention but within

OF DIVERSE PRESENTATIONS 147 
the Self. When this balance appears to be broken by the 
empirical ego we experience the special state which we 
describe as an act of volition or an act of will. As this act 
of volition is due to the efficiency of the Self, as explicit in 
the efficiency of the empirical ego, we shall refer to it more 
at length in Book 11.

Sec. 1. Eacu man assumes in every day life that there 
exist other human consciousnesses than his own, and other 
animal consciousnesses ; and that these are embodied in 
other human or animal individuals. In connection with 
the study of the general nature of human consciousness in 
the previous chapters it may be well to consider briefly the 
basis of this assumption, and some of its implications. 
If we first turn our attention to other human conscious- 
| nesses, we note that as the result of a combination of 
introspective and objective observation we individual men 
| discover that modifications in our consciousnesses are in 
some way correspondent with activities in those outer-world 
objects which we call our own human bodies. When, 
then, we observe in our outer world other human bodies 
acting in much the same way that our bodies act in con- 
nection with modifications of our consciousnesses, we make 
an implicit judgment that other consciousnesses exist in 
relation to the other human bodies whose activities we thus 
observe ; we introject, as it were, consciousnesses into the   
  
-P-A-G-E-163
    CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 149 
human bodies of other human individuals who come within 
our field of consideration. This process is of course not 
clearly thought out; but the movement of our thought 
in analogical lines seldom is.1 
The common man is likely to say that we have other 
reason for this assumption than this analogical procedure, 
in’the fact that other men tell us in spoken words of their 
“states of mind.” But it becomes very clear upon con- 
sideration that no amount of hearsay evidence would suffice 
to convince us that these other men are conscious, did we 
not note that our activities, which are very like their 
activities, are accompanied in our experience by certain 
modifications in our consciousnesses. The very speech of 
others is a type of this activity which we interpret by refer- 
ence to the modifications of consciousness which go with 
our own similar speech activities. When for instance I 
say ‘‘ yes,” I hear the sound of my own voice, and at the 
same time experience a modification in my consciousness 
which I describe as the state of assent. When my friend 
says “‘ yes,” I hear the same sounds which a moment ago 
proceeded from my own body, and I assume that my friend 
experiences a conscious state closely similar to that which 
in my own experience I describe as assent. In this way 
through all the complexities of observed activities in other 
human bodies we introject into other men conscious states 
similar to our own conscious states, when they and we 
ourselves act in the same way, or are subjected to the same 
stimulations from the environment. 
Even when we have reached an established acceptance of 
the fact that consciousnesses exist in relation to other living 
human bodies we find, if we consider the matter carefully, 
1That our knowledge of other’s minds rests upon an argument from 
analogy has of course been recognized by many masters ; in modern times, 
for instance, by Malebranch, Locke, Berkeley and Hume. Confer Fullerton,

that we are constantly dependent upon this interpretation,— 
this argument by analogy,—for our simplest knowledge of 
the mental states of other men. We agree to describe the 
conscious states accompanying stimulations of the eye as light 
sensations; but in the fact that similar stimuli reach your eye 
and mine I have no evidence that what you call light sensa- 
tions are what I call light sensations, apart from the fact that 
I judge by analogy that, as you are very like me, you are to 
be credited when you say that you have a consciousness very 
like mine; and that as your eye is very like mine, its stimu- 
lation by light must correspond with modifications of your 
consciousness very similar to the modifications in my con- 
sciousness that correspond with the stimulation of my eye 
under the same light conditions. That this argument by 
analogy is the basis of our assurance of the existence of 
consciousnesses in other men becomes indeed very clear in 
the fact that, as we shall see more fully later on, we do not 
hesitate for a moment to pass beyond human-kind, and 
ascribe consciousnesses to the higher animals other than 
man, although they are entirely incapable of describing to 
us their mental states if such exist. And if we carry our 
argument by analogy to its legitimate conclusion we are 
without question led to say with Professor Jennings’ that 
“ from the lowest organisms up to man behavior is essentially 
regulatory in character, and what we call intelligence in 
higher animals is a direct outgrowth of the same laws that 
give behavior its regulatory character in the protozoa.” 
A 
Sec. 2. It would perhaps seem unnecessary to give any 
further space to the consideration of this subject were it not 
that the acceptance of this argument by analogy as extended 
to animals carries with it certain implications that are not 
very generally appreciated.

-P-A-G-E-165
CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 151 
The conclusion that some of the animals at least are 
conscious beings whose consciousnesses are simpler than our 
own was of course reached long before men had any know- 
ledge of the nature of the human nervous system and of 
its relation to man’s conscious states: the existence of other 
than human consciousnesses had been naturally inferred 
from data quite similar to those which led men to infer the 
existence of consciousnesses in their fellow men. But had 
no such inference been previously made, we, with our newly 
gained knowledge, would be forced to such a view. For 
human consciousness, as we appreciate it, appears to be what 
we speak of as a definitely bounded,—a closed,—system of 
mentalities: and this psychic system is now very generally 
acknowledged to be coincident with the activities in what 
we look upon as a closed neural system. This fact naturally 
leads to the inference that, as I discover in my fellow man 
a closed neural system similar to what I know must exist 
in my own body, so this fellow man must have a conscious- 
ness not dissimilar from mine. And this argument carries 
with it the inference that a consciousness exists wherever 
we find what we call a closed system of neural activities ; 
and would lead us naturally to believe in the existence of 
consciousnesses in animals of higher and lower grade, wher- 
ever we note in them the existence of any semblance of 
closed neural systems. 
Sec. 3. But if consciousnesses exist in correlation with 
the active nervous systems of the lower animals, then it 
appears likely that these animal consciousnesses must be 
simpler than ours just in so far as the animal’s nervous 
organization is simpler than man’s. Furthermore we realize 
that at birth the consciousnesses connected with our own 
bodies were psychic systems of less complexity than our 
consciousnesses as they appear in years of maturity ; and 
that these consciousnesses at birth corresponded with 
neururgic systems less highly developed than those found
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
in man at his maturity. It is most natural for us therefore 
to infer that some animals have consciousnesses which never 
develop beyond the complexity of human consciousnesses as 
they appear in early infancy, just because we find in these 
animals nervous systems which at their maturity never 
develop beyond forms very like those found in the human 
embryo. 
There are many other reasons in favor of the view here 
referred to ; but it is not worth while to review them, for 
few if any in these days hesitate to acknowledge that there 
are probably consciousnesses of decreasing complexity, cor- 
responding with the decreasing complexity of the nervous 
systems found in animals as we step to lower and lower 
grades of organization in the course of our biological studies. 
Although there is considerable hesitancy on the part of our 
biologists in the attribution of consciousness to very low 
forms of life, they have been entirely unable to agree upon 
any line of demarcation to distinguish the so-called uncon- 
scious animal forms from those which they all agree to be 
conscious. 
B 
Sec. 4. But if we make the acknowledgment that con- 
sciousnesses exist in correspondence with neururgic systems 
of less complexity than those which appear in man, then we 
are quite naturally led to certain considerations of great 
interest in reference to human consciousness itself. 
If as we have just said human consciousness is a closed 
psychic system, corresponding with the man’s closed nervous 
system, then disconnection seems to mark the individuality 
of systems of mentalities which we call consciousnesses. 
Now we find within the human body certain minor nervous 
systems which are parts of the whole complex nervous 
system,—minor systems which correspond in complexity 
more or less closely with the whole fully formed nervous 
systems of certain of the lower animals which we are accus-
-P-A-G-E-167
  CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 153 
tomed to look upon as conscious beings. It would appear 
therefore that if these minor nervous systems within the 
whole nervous system of man could persist as such, and yet 
be placed out of relation to the whole system of nervous 
systems, they would then be themselves closed nervous 
systéms, and we would have a right to assume that their 
activities would still remain coincident with consciousnesses 
of lower grades of complexity than human consciousnesses, 
as these are known in reflection. 
Now it is clear that many of these minor nervous systems 
in man do often persist as such, although they are placed out 
of relation with his nervous system taken as a whole. We 
recognize the fact that there are minor nervous systems 
within the human body (e.g. the sympathetic nervous 
system), which are at all times so nearly separated from the 
whole of the individual’s complex system of nervous systems 
that they appear for the most part to act quite independently, 
although at times they distinctly affect the action of the 
whole system of systems, and are distinctly affected by it. 
We recognize also that there are within the human body 
other minor nervous systems (e.g. the ganglia of the spinal 
cord), which in normal life are practically disconnected from 
the system of nervous systems taken as a whole, and which 
may, under certain conditions resulting from pathological 
deterioration or from the use of the surgeon’s knife, become 
actually fully disconnected, and this without failing to persist, 
and to act, or “‘ express themselves,” as minor systems. 
Suppose you were shown a frog with its head covered so 
that it could not be disturbed by your movements, and 
fastened with tapes to a board, but with both legs free. 
Now if I were to put a drop of weak acid say on its right 
knee, it would promptly rub the acid off with the back of the 
right foot. But suppose I fastened this right foot down 
with tapes, or disabled it permanently, and then again 
touched the right knee with acid ; then the right leg would
-P-A-G-E-168
  154 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
struggle in the attempt to rub off the acid as it did before ; 
but being unsuccessful because of the binding tapes or 
injury, after a moment of quiescence or hesitation, it would 
rub the acid off with the foot on the other side, i.e. the left 
foot. The common man would be likely to say, off hand, 
that the frog displayed a good deal of intelligence in this. 
But now suppose I remove the head bandages and show 
you that the frog’s head, and with it its brain, had been 
entirely removed. Experiments show that the frog will act 
in exactly the way above described if its brain is extirpated. 
When you discovered this fact, if you made any remark, 
you might properly say ‘‘ what a high degree of intelligence 
is involved with the mere activities of the spinal cord.” 
The average biologist, to be sure, says not this, but rather 
“unconscious reflexes simulate the actions due to intelli- 
gence”: but I submit that he does this solely because of 
his preconception that the activities of the cortex of the 
brain are alone concerned with our conscious states. The 
very argument by analogy which leads you to say that other 
men have consciousnesses because they act thus and so, also 
leads you to hold that the live and healthy frog with its 
brain intact has a consciousness ; and if this argument is 
worth anything at all it must surely lead you also to 
say that the frog’s spinal cord activities have psychic 
correspondents. 
And if this is true of the frog, why is it not true of man? 
In my normal life these psychic correspondents of the spinal 
cord activities are minor psychic systems within the whole 
psychic system that I call consciousness. These minor 
systems indeed are usually unable to affect attention, 
although occasionally some of them do so when we are 
quiescent: e.g. I do not note the heart throb now, but I 
may as I am falling asleep. 
‘We may note also that beyond such disconnections as we 
have above referred to there is evidence that a practical 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
    CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 155 
disconnection of the activities of partial systems, within the 
total neural system in a man’s body, may occur as the result 
of what we may call an incommensurability of rhythm 
between the activities of the partial systems and of the pre- 
eminent system. 
We are thus led to the conclusion that the normal human 
consciousness is subject to dissociation of partial systems to 
so great an extent that it is more just to describe ourselves 
as a bundle of multiple minor consciousnesses, one of which, 
and the most complex of which, normally appears as pre- 
eminent. This pre-eminent consciousness is, during waking 
life, coincident practically with the activity of the brain ; 
and certain minor systems (notably the sympathetic nervous 
system, and the spinal cord systems) are then practically cut 
off from the brain system, and may be assumed to have 
separate consciousnesses of their own which scarcely influence 
the pre-eminent psychic system which par excellence we call 
consciousness. But if these previously disconnected minor 
nervous systems become connected with the pre-eminent 
system,—if perhaps the rhythm of activity of these minor 
nervous systems becomes commensurable with that of the 
brain system,—then they may become again part and parcel 
of this brain system; and the minor consciousnesses 
coincident with their activities may then become partial 
within the unity of the pre-eminent consciousnéss. We 
are clearly led thus to see that, apart from the pre-eminent 
consciousness, we must assume the existence of minor con- 
sciousnesses in connection with the human body. 
This view has been suggested long since, but is rejected, 
and often with derision, by some of our biologists; its 
rejection however I am convinced is merely due to an 
unwarranted hesitation to carry our every day reasoning to 
its legitimate conclusion. The pre-eminent nervous system 
expresses itself by bodily activities of one kind or another, 
and notably by certain contractions of the throat and 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  156 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
respiratory organs, and movements of the lips which produce 
speech. The sympathetic system, and the practically or 
actually separated minor nervous systems, express them- 
selves by bodily activities of one kind or another exclusive 
of these activities of speech. While it is perfectly clear that 
the consciousness which expresses itself in speech, as well 
as in various other bodily activities, is the pre-eminent 
human consciousness ; it seems equally clear that there must 
exist minor consciousnesses which correspond with the 
activities of minor nervous systems within our own bodies 
which are at times practically, or in some cases actually, 
disconnected from the main system of nervous systems. 
One objection which is often brought against this 
assumption is that, even if we grant the force of the general 
argument by analogy above suggested, it is the pre-eminent 
psychic system alone in man that is worthy of being called 
his consciousness ; and that these minor psychic systems, 
being apart from the pre-eminent system of psychic systems, 
cannot properly be called consciousnesses. But the answer 
to this objection is clear when we consider: 1st, that these 
separated minor nervous systems are, as we have already 
seen, quite comparable in complexity with the whole nervous 
systems of certain adult forms of animals to which we do 
not hesitate to grant some form of consciousness ; and 2nd, 
that the activity of these minor systems within the human 
body often does affect the activity of the whole system of 
nervous systems sufficiently to involve a coincident modi- 
fication in the whole system of psychic systems which we all 
agree to call consciousness. 
Sec. 5. But it is evident that what we have above spoken 
of as minor consciousnesses must vary in breadth and co- 
ordination, and we are thus brought to the consideration 
of certain points of the greatest significance. 
If we consider the complex nature of the nervous system 
it is evident that while it may appear usually to act as a 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 157 
systematized whole of thoroughly related parts, nevertheless 
it is potentially divisible into separate large systems as the 
result of the simultaneous reception of stimuli to activities 
which are incommensurable in rhythm, if we may so speak. 
Thus while the neururgic pattern of the mass as a whole in 
any moment may appear as a unit ; nevertheless there exists 
always the possibility of the appearance, in the whole mass, 
of neururgic patterns in large number, some of which may 
be incommensurable in rhythm, and utterly incompatible 
with one another. 
If special stimuli tend to produce in a part of the whole 
system some special partial neururgic pattern which if pro- 
duced would be incompatible with any neururgic pattern 
which could appear in the system of systems as a whole, 
then a large undifferentiable system of activities, which are 
involved in the production of this special neururgic pattern, 
may well be detached as it were by its special form of 
activity from the system of systems taken as a whole. If 
two or more stimulative systems (for the sake of simplicity 
we shall speak of two only) act at the same moment upon 
the total system, then two neururgic patterns will tend to 
be developed, and if these are incompatible there will result 
a separation of the corresponding systems of neural activity 
within the total system. 
Now if one of these two diverse systems is relatively 
unimportant, the separation away of its activity from the 
total mass of activities will be unimportant, and the activity 
of the whole major system will not be materially changed: we 
shall have the great system reacting as a whole in the form 
of the relatively important neururgic pattern, the relatively 
unimportant system being for the time eliminated from the 
mass: provided, be it noted, that this minor system is incom- 
patible as to rhythm with the major system as stimulated. 
And as a matter of fact we must look upon the great system 
as constantly developing innumerable neururgic patterns  
-P-A-G-E-172
158 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
which are either rhythmically commensurable with the whole 
activity of the major system, and which therefore become 
absorbed in the dominant neururgic pattern ; or which, 
being incommensurable, cause the separation away from it 
of parts of the whole system, leaving the mass to all intents 
and purposes unaltered. As some minor systems become 
disconnected, at the same time others which have been dis- 
connected may again become connected. 
But evidently in certain cases stimuli may call for reactions 
which will bring into emphasis within the major system two 
or more neururgic patterns of practically equal significance ; 
and in such cases, if the neururgic patterns are mutually 
unassimilable, there will be a breaking up of the major 
system into two or more equally important systems of 
activity. Or it may happen that the rhythms of the two 
neururgic patterns may be almost completely incommensur- 
able, yet not utterly incompatible ;—that one pattern may 
sweep over, and through, the other pattern, as the waves on 
the surface of a pond caused by a steady wind may be crossed 
by the waves caused by the stone I throw into the water in 
a direction at right angles to the course of the wind. But 
in either event the main system of neururgic systems will 
be broken up into two (or more) great systems. 
Sec. 6. Turning to the consideration of the correspond- 
ing noetic systems we are led to see that it is possible that 
quite separate consciousnesses of high complexity and of full 
co-ordination may under certain conditions co-exist in con- 
nection with the same human individual,—‘‘ co-conscious- 
nesses,” as Dr. Morton Prince would have us call them. 
Evidence of such co-existing consciousnesses is given in 
great abundance in pathological cases which are studied with 
great fullness and care in Dr. Prince’s important work, 
Dissociation of a Personality, to be considered more fully 
in Chapter xxv. 
As we know, the early man of limited intelligence, when 
  
oe
-P-A-G-E-173
CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 159 
he saw his friend act in a manner very different from that 
to which he had become accustomed, found it most natural 
to attribute the new type of action to the fact that his friend’s 
body had become ‘“‘ possessed” by another “ spirit” than 
that which seemed usually to control it. And I submit that 
if we could study the activities of other men without any 
knowledge that we are men, and without any undue reference 
to, or deductions from, our introspective experience, we 
would hold that the uncivilized man was not without justifi- 
cation in holding to this spirit theory. We would indeed 
go farther, and would say that the cases which at first attract 
our attention, and lead us to attribute diverse consciousness 
to the same individual, were indeed morbid cases in which 
the diversity is distinctly suggested, but that nevertheless 
they point to a general truth: and that we have only to 
observe perfectly normal life closely, and with care, to find 
ourselves able to see the evidence of the very frequent 
existence of diverse consciousnesses in the same individual. 
The consciousness of the vigorous optimistic man who, 
refreshed by sleep, undertakes joyously his daily task, is 
surely quite diverse from that of the same individual who, 
dejected and wearied by toil, and depressed by failure, 
returns home in the evening hours. 
Having gone thus far we would say further that there is 
much evidence of diverse consciousnesses at times holding 
possession of the same individual at one and the same 
moment: consciousnesses which at times are in conflict, as 
is evidenced by hesitancy, or rapid changes of expressive 
activity : consciousnesses which at times “‘ take possession ” 
as it were of diverse parts of the expressive system, as is 
evidenced when a man who is playing on the piano from a 
score with which he is perfectly familiar, at the same time 
carries on a vigorous conversation with his companion on 
matters unrelated to the music ; or in cases of ‘‘ automatic 
writing ” which are for the most part abnormal, but which
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
we have lately discovered may be produced artificially in 
many perfectly normal individuals. 
A pre-eminent position is usually given in our thought to 
that consciousness of any moment which is coincident with 
the action of those important organic systems upon which 
speech, and written language, and thought, depend; and 
‘in cases where more than one consciousness possesses the 
individual, this latter is the consciousness which is looked 
upon as the rea/ one. ‘Thus we speak of the musical work 
of the person at the piano with whom we are conversing as 
being entirely mechanical; and the writing of the person 
who is reading to us as automatic writing. But it seems 
clear that the nature of the psychic mass to which are given 
the impressions which lead to the playing in the one case, 
and to the writing in the other, is of the same general nature, 
and deserves as full consideration, as that psychic mass to 
which are given the impressions which lead to the conver- 
sation in the one case, and to the reading aloud in the other. 
I do not intend to deny that we are perfectly justified in 
judging that one of these diverse consciousnesses is more 
important than the other, or others. We are perfectly war- 
ranted in describing one of them as typical, as the real 
consciousness of the man,—while the others are looked upon 
as more or less unimportant, and imperfect, and short lived. 
But I think it cannot be denied that all objective evidence 
points to the frequent existence in the same individual man 
of utterly diverse consciousnesses at one and the same time. 
Cc 
Sec. 7. We are led here to take a further step: for a 
nervous system is a system of ‘‘ elements,” i.e. of parts in 
which may originate special activities within the system: 
and it seems natural to assume that if we could isolate a 
living active neural element, we should be bound to assume 
that a psychic element corresponded with its activities.
-P-A-G-E-175
CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 161 
It may be true that the neurologist has never been able to 
discover a disconnected, isolated, living, neural element ; 
nevertheless if, as we have above argued, minor neural 
systems may exist within the human body and remain active 
even though disconnected from the major nervous system 
taken as a whole, it seems highly probable that living neural 
elements may from time to time be disconnected from, and 
then again reconnected with, one or another of the minor 
systems which go to make up the nervous system as a whole. 
Correspondingly it is true also that the psychologist has 
not been able to isolate any thing that can properly be called 
a psychic element ; and even if he could do so, it as an 
element could not appear as an emphasis in reflection within 
consciousness, for consciousness under our view is necessarily 
systematic and not elemental. Nevertheless, if minor psychic 
systems,—minor consciousnesses,—in correspondence with 
minor nervous systems within the human body, may exist 
as disconnected from the major human consciousness taken 
as a whole, it seems necessary to assume that psychic ele- 
ments, in correspondence with disconnected neural elements, 
may be from time to time disconnected from, and then again 
reconnected with, one or another of the minor psychic sys- 
tems within consciousness ; some being now cut off, some 
being now added on, to go to make unanalyzable differences 
from moment to moment in the nature of our conscious- 
nesses. 
Sec. 8. The above arguments by analogy seem to be so 
natural that it would be scarcely worth while to say more in 
relation to them were it not that our conclusions stand in 
opposition to the views of many writers of unquestioned 
authority. It is the habit of many psychologists and bio- 
logists to treat consciousness as a deus ex machina which 
they bring forward, often most recklessly, to explain adapta- 
tions observed in animal behavior which cannot readily be 
ascribed to instinctive processes which they look upon as 
L  
-P-A-G-E-176
  162 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
automatic and mechanical. They speak of consciousness in 
such cases as “‘ effective consciousness,” and although they 
allow that there is another form of consciousness, which they 
designate as ‘‘ sentience,” in connection with certain of these 
quasi mechanical processes, they do not admit that this 
sentience is “effective” ; and having accustomed them- 
selves to conceive of a break between effective and non- 
effective consciousness, they find it easy to assume that there 
is no difficulty in imagining many forms of neural activity 
to which no psychic states whatever correspond. Some bio- 
logists actually go so far as to assert that it is sheer nonsense 
to assume even that all animals in which we discover nervous 
systems possess forms of consciousness.? 
But it appears to me impossible to acknowledge the 
coincidence between some nervous activities and certain 
changes in the stream of consciousness ; and then to assert 
that beyond the narrow limits of which we can judge in 
reflection there are no psychic coincidents of nervous activi- 
ties. It may be true, as Loeb says,® that ‘‘ the idea of a 
1Prof. Loeb in his Physiohgy of the Brain heaps ridicule upon such 
hypotheses as we here present. The force of his statement is vitiated 
however by the fact that he appears to have no proper conception of 
what psychologists generally mean by the word consciousness. He assumes 
that they limit the meaning of the word to that special phase of conscious- 
ness which the psychologist designates as reflective consciousness. “All 
these speculations,” says he (p. 251), “collapse as soon as we realize 
that the term consciousness, or soul, is applied by metaphysicians to 
phenomena of associative memory; and that the latter depends upon 
a physical mechanism which must be just as definite as, for example, 
the dioptrical apparatus of our eye.” 
But psychologists do not refer only to the phenomena of “associative 
memory” when they speak of consciousness. "They mean by consciousness 
something much broader than “associative memory,” which latter may 
possibly, as Prof. Loeb argues, require a special physical mechanism which 
is only produced at certain “critical points” in the course of animal 
development. Confer his remarks on pp. 252 and 253. 
2p. cit. p. 253.
-P-A-G-E-177
  CONSCIOUSNESSES SIMPLER THAN HUMAN 163 
steady, continuous development is inconsistent with the 
general physical qualities of protoplasm, or colloidal material. 
The colloidal substances in our protoplasm, possess critical 
points.’ And it may possibly be true that “just as only 
certain animals are provided with apparatus for visual space- 
perception, only certain animals are provided with the 
mechanism necessary for associative memory.”! But this 
does not argue that there is no psychic change, of a type 
which is not involved with ‘‘ associative memory,” coincident 
with changes of activity in parts of the nervous system which 
are not part of the special mechanism which he is con- 
sidering. 
Surely the most natural hypothesis to adopt is the one I 
here defend: viz. that if the neural activity coincident with 
that part of consciousness which we can study in reflection 
is that of a complex system of nervous systems ; then it is 
in the highest degree probable that, as there are neural ele- 
ments of which this complex system is built up, so there 
must be psychic elements coincident with the activities of 
these neural elements,—psychic elements out of which the 
complex system of psychic systems which we call conscious- 
ness is, as it were, built up. 
And if this be true it would seem to be an error to assume, 
as is so commonly done, that the activities in the cortex of 
the brain alone are coincident with consciousness; and that 
the activities of other parts of the nervous system are merely 
mechanically related to the brain. Under our view all 
activities in all parts of the nervous system, of which the 
brain is the pre-eminently important part, must have psychic 
coincidents which form parts of consciousness. It may be, 
and probably is, true that the emphatic activities within the 
system take place for the most part in the brain ; and that 
the emphatic presentations which appear in consciousness are 
the coincidents of these emphases of activity in the brain 
10p. cit. p. 252.
-P-A-G-E-178
    164 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
part of the whole system. But this should not lead us to 
hold that the unemphatic nervous activities of any moment 
are without influence upon the activity of the whole nervous 
system if it is considered as a unit ; nor should it lead us 
to hold that the coincident unemphatic psychic parts are of 
no significance in the sum total of the consciousness of the 
moment. 
Surely if we with our present knowledge of the nature 
of the nervous system had for the first time noted this corre- 
spondence between the action of neural systems and con- 
sciousness, we would have argued at once, either that the 
whole notion of the connection between neural activity and 
psychic states must be illusory ; or else that the correspon- 
dence must be general for all nerve action, and that we must 
look for some such explanation as I have elsewhere given 
of the fact that psychic states appear to be connected only with 
particular nerve actions at particular times. 
D 
Sec. 9. If we accept the above conclusion we are led to 
take one further step of importance. 
We commonly assume that so special a significance is to 
be given to action within the nervous system in man’s 
organism that it alone can be considered of moment in the 
relations of correspondence with consciousness. Some of 
our modern biologists, however, believe that they have 
ground for holding that all protoplasmic substance has 
powers of interaction,—or “‘ conduction,”—similar to those 
1Confer Loeb, Physiohgy of the Brain, p. 60 and elsewhere. Prof. 
Loeb, as we have seen above, scouts the very idea that this, or any 
other fact, points to the conclusions which we here suggest ; but I judge, 
as I have already said, that this is because “consciousness” for him 
means something much narrower than it does for us here. Confer in 
opposition, Bethe, Allgemeine Anatomie und Physiologie des Nerven Systems, 
as referred to by Libby in University of Colorado Studies, June 1905, 
pp. 223 and 224.

observed in nervous tisse ; and that masses of protoplasm 
may form systems of active life without the existence of 
anything like nervous syste'ms ; nervous matter indeed under 
such a view appearing to pe but a specially differentiated 
kind of protoplasm which serves as a peculiarly quick and 
sensitive ‘“‘ conductor” fron) part to part of the organism. 
This, or some similar view, seems likely to prevail, as it 
is in line with the modern emphasis of the fundamental 
likeness in all living forms ; + \and it seems possible therefore 
to hold that while the form of consciousness with which we 
are familiar is practically correspondent only with transfers 
of energy within the vastly complex human nervous system ; 
nevertheless it may be true that any transfer of energy in 
protoplasmic matter may have ‘a coincident psychic effect ; 
and that consciousnesses of a ‘certain grade may exist in 
living bodies which are systematized and yet without nervous 
systems. 
If such a view be possible then we must hold that human 
consciousness is in all probability complicated by the exist- 
ence of psychic correspondents of transfers of energy in 
other protoplasmic masses than those which we designate as 
the nervous system ; although it must of course be granted 
that the very superior “‘ conductivity ” of the nervous masses 
makes the part of human consciousness which, under such 
a view, corresponds with activity of the nervous system 
vastly more important in the whole of man’s consciousness 
than all the rest of the psychic effects corresponding with 
transfers of energy in protoplasmic masses other than the 
nervous tissues.

“The writer is thoroughly convinced, after a long study of the behavior 
of this organism, that if amoeba were a large animal, so as to come 
within the every-day experience of human beings, its behavior would 
at once call forth the attribution to it of states of pleasure and pain, 
of hunger, desire, and the like, on precisely the same basis as we attribute 
these things to the dog.”

If we once agree that all transfers of energy in proto- 
plasmic substance have their psychic correspondences, then 
of course we must allow that thiere are consciousnesses of a 
lowly and sluggish nature in cothnection with the lowly and 
sluggish life of the plants. ‘This, it will be remembered, 
was a point defended on other grounds by the great psycho- 
logist Fechner, and which hag been since upheld by not a 
few, among whom we may methtion a man of as high position 
as Paulsen. /

argument in favor of the broad view of the nature of con- 
sciousness thus taken that: in connection with this concep- 
tion we have a completely satisfactory answer to the old time 
puzzle as to the moment of the beginning of the individual 
soul life. é 
In the human species, to which in this connection we may 
confine our attention, the unfructified germ cell is a living 
protoplasmic particle which is cast off from the body of the 
female ; and, under such :a view as we have above been led 
to hold, so long as it is a living particle, it has corresponding 
with its exceedingly lowly activities, an exceedingly lowly 
form of psychic existence. 
While it was part of the body of the female it had its 
little part in forming the totality of those systemic physical 
activities to which corresponded the female’s consciousness. 
The germ cell may happen to be fructified, and attach itself 
to the internal tissues of the body of the female. Notwith- 
standing that this attachment is only of such nature that 
our biologists call it parasitic, nevertheless, under the view 
here taken, the cell again becomes part of the whole bodily 
system of the mother, and its activities again play their lowly

part in the production of the systemic action of the whole 
body, which has its correspondent in the whole of the con- 
sciousness of the adult female. 
This germ cell under these conditions, within the female, 
and in connection with her body, develops very rapidly into 
the embryo. It is true that the relation of the embryo to 
the mother continues to be almost parasitic in its nature 
during its development up to the time of birth, as it also 
remains for a considerable time after birth. Nevertheless, 
it draws its nourishment from, and is in a broad sense sys- 
temically related to, her body. For as part of her bodily 
system no activity in any part of the embryo can be without 
some direct or indirect effect upon each and every part of 
the body of the mother ; and no activity in any of these 
parts of the mother can be soia/ly without direct or indirect 
effect upon it. 
The psychic coincidents of the activities in the embryo are . 
thus part and parcel of the mother’s consciousness, if this is 
considered in the broad way presented in the preceding sec- 
tion. As the embryo grows, within it develops a nervous 
system of its own, and if our view is correct a minor form 
of consciousness must exist in connection with the activities 
of this rudimentary nervous system. It is true that, so far 
as we know, the nervous system of the embryo never has 
a direct connection with the nervous system of the mother: 
nevertheless as there is a reciprocity of reaction between the 
physical body of the mother and its embryonic parasite, the 
relation of the embryonic nervous system to the nervous 
system of the mother is not very far removed from the rela- 
tion of the pre-eminent part of the nervous system of a man 
to some minor nervous system within his body which is to 
a marked extent disassociated from the whole neural mass. 
Correspondingly then, and within the consciousness of the 
mother, there. develops a new little minor consciousness 
which, although but lightly integrated with the mass of her  
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
consciousness, nevertheless has its part in her consciousness 
taken as a whole, much as the psychic correspondents of the 
action of the nerves which govern the secretions of the 
glands of her body have their part in her consciousness taken 
as a whole. 
It is very much as if the optic ganglia developed fully in 
themselves, without any closer connection with the rest of 
the brain than existed at their first appearance. They would 
form a little complex nervous system almost but not quite 
apart from the brain system ; and it would be difficult to 
deny them a consciousness of their own ; which would indeed 
form part of the whole consciousness of the individual, but 
which would be in a measure self-dependent. Should the 
optic ganglia when fully developed be separated away from 
the brain, then what was once a minor system within the 
whole brain system would become a new individual with an 
optic consciousness all its own. 
Now something not unlike this happens at birth. Before 
birth the minor physical system, i.e. the embryo, though 
lightly attached to, is nevertheless part of the physical system 
of the mother: and the psychic correspondents of its activi- 
ties form part of a complex consciousness which is that of 
the mother and embryo together ; the psychic correspondents 
of the activities of the mother, as exclusive of those of the 
embryonic parasite, being of course pre-eminent in such a 
complex psychic system. 
At birth we have a disruption of the less developed, from 
the more developed, physical system ; and corresponding 
therewith we have a minor consciousness of low development 
“split off » from the more highly developed pre-eminent 
consciousness of the mother which remains to all intents 
and purposes intact. The new “‘ split off ” minor conscious- 
ness then begins its existence as an individual entity, and 
as time goes on develops into a full formed human individual 
consciousness.

is) 
Sec. 12. The considerations; hof the preceding sections 
turn our minds naturally again to] the question as to the limits 
of human consciousness referred \ to briefly in Chapter I. 
In Chapter 1. we have seen that the word consciousness is 
used to express two diverse meanings: (1) psychic existence 
as such ; and (2) awareness. If} we bear this in mind we 
find the solution of many difficulties that trouble not only 
the common man, but also the psychologist. 
If our theories are correct consciousness must continue to 
exist so long as life exists. In states of sleep where we are 
wont to say that we are unconscious, it appears that we so 
judge merely because in later moments we are unaware of 
the sleep consciousness that is because we are unable to recall 
in our active waking life the {psychic existents of the 
moments of sleep.1 
Of the so-called unconsciousness of states of coma we. 
have a like explanation: but in this case the lack of aware- 
ness due to failure to recall is often complicated by failures 
of assimilation ; as in cases of concussion of the brain where 
the injured man after recovery is likely to say that he is 
unconscious of all that happened long before the accident, 
although at the moment of the accident he evidently must 
have been vividly aware of what was going on. 
The reflex acts which are usually said to be unconscious 
are either so unimportant in reference to the whole pulse of 
the nervous system in the moment in which they appear, 
that their psychic coincidents are not sufficiently important 
in consciousness to appear in the field of attention, without 
which awareness cannot occur ; or else they are practically

disconnected from the pre-eminent nervous system, their 
psychic correspondents beitig therefore disconnected from the 
pre-eminent consciousness ‘which contains the field of aware- 
ness. | 
States of so-called unc@nsciousness produced by anaes- 
thetics under our view are states of consciousness of low 
grade which are incommensurable in rhythm, so to speak, 
with the consciousness of | waking life. The conditions of 
anaesthesia may be in part due to a practical’ disconnection 
from the major nervous system of those special parts which 
are active in coincidence with what would be painful states 
under normal conditions.| But under our theory, even in 
cases where the most comiplete anaesthesia is produced, we 
have little evidence of ‘‘ unconsciousness,” if we mean 
psychic non-existence, during the operation other than the 
fact that in the waking state we fail to revive any psychic 
states which may have existed during the artificial sleep pro- 
duced by the drug.’ 
1It has been argued by M. Philippi, as the result of a large number 
of observations, (Revue Philosophique, May 1899,) that there is no ground 
whatever for the notion that consciousness is absent during surgical 
operations under the influence of anaesthetics. As he shows, patients 
often scream during the operation, and make futile efforts to stop the 
surgeons at their work; and nevertheless fail after the operation to recall 
any of the circumstances attending it. It is surely absurd to hold that 
this screaming, and these efforts. to avoid the pain-bringing knife, are 
merely reflexes which have no corresponding presentations in a con- 
sciousness of the moment of protest and struggle, without other evidence 
than the fact that such activities fail to produce revivals in the moments 
following. If we take such a position we are surely forced to hold 
that the hypnotic patient is unconscious because he fails to recall in 
normal life the presentations of the trance state, All that we can properly 
hold is that normal revivals of the presentations which were experienced 
while the patient was under the influence of the anaesthetic are cut 
off from the consciousness of the fully awake state which occurs when 
the influence of the anaesthetic has disappeared.

in this same article he gives cases showing that “anaesthetic” members

The ‘‘ subliminal consciousness,” and the ‘‘ subconscious,” 
according to this view, are unfortunate terms referring to 
psychic existence below the level of ‘‘ awareness,” i.e. to 
what I would prefer to call the sub-attentive consciousness.* 
We may surely hold that this sub-attentive consciousness 
is fundamentally of the same nature as the attentive con- 
sciousness, and that like the latter it is elaborately systema- 
tized. Under such a view ‘‘ unconscious cerebration ” is 
explicable as a condition where certain noetic patterns which 
are so unemphatic that they remain within the sub-attentive 
consciousness develop resultants which are sufficiently em- 
phatic to force themselves into the field of attention. 
Where ‘‘ co-consciousnesses ” exist in the same individual, 
if it is shown that such do exist, the whole of one of the 
co-consciousnesses,—the subordinate one,—will usually be 
entirely disconnected from the wide-awake consciousness: so 
far as the two are connected, however, such parts of the 
subordinated one as affect the wide-awake one must usually 
belong to this latter’s sub-attentive consciousness. 
While the subordinate consciousness may at times be 
without means of expression, it nevertheless may develop 
what, if given in clear experience, would appear as fields of 
attention, and a field of inattention, i.e. a subordinate Self. 
Suggestion to this sub-attentive consciousness (“‘ sub- 
consciousness ”) is also readily explicable.2 Suggestion to 
attentive consciousness is the most common of occurrences: 
and it often results in the development of new noetic patterns 
of the body execute adaptative movements in relation to excitation ; 
and adaptation to special conditions ,is the mark which biologists generally 
agree to be the sign of consciousness in the lower forms of animal life 
whose conscious states can only be inferred,

which are far more emphatic than those from which the new 
patterns develop. So suggestion to the sub-attentive con- 
sciousness may result in the development of new noetic 
patterns which will be so emphatic that they force themselves 
out of inattention into the field of attention or ‘‘ aware- 
ness”: as happens in cases of ‘‘ unconscious cerebration ” 
above referred to.

  CHAPTER VII 
OF CONSCIOUSNESSES MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 
CONSCIOUSNESSES 
Sec. 1. In the previous chapter we have seen that we 
have ample grounds for holding that other consciousnesses 
exist which are less complex than human consciousnesses ; 
and we are naturally led to enquire whether other forms of 
consciousness may exist which are still more complex than 
those human forms with which we are made familiar in our 
life of reflection. We may well begin this study by asking 
what ground there is for the supposition so frequently met 
with in modern writings that more complex forms of con- 
sciousness exist in which the consciousnesses of individual 
men appear as elementary parts. 
A 
Sec. 2. The fact that each human consciousness is a 
psychic system which is a complex of minor psychic systems, 
each of which is itself a highly complex system of psychic 
elements, leads us to see that it is by no means impossible 
that our own complex psychic systems, taken as wholes, i.e. 
our own consciousnesses, may be joined with other complex 
psychic systems, i.e. other consciousnesses, in the formation 
of consciousnesses of still higher grades of complexity. We 
are led thus in the first place to consider whether there is any 
possibility of the formation of such higher psychic systems
-P-A-G-E-188
174. CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
from the combination of the consciousnesses of human 
beings aggregated in social masses: whether in other words 
there can be any such thing as a “‘ social consciousness” ; 
and whether coincidently the aggregate of individuals in 
a social body may rightly be looked upon as a “social 
organism.” 
The first thought that suggéests itself to us in this con- 
nection seems to argue against such a notion: for we are 
accustomed to hold that the neural systems with which the 
consciousnesses of men are correlated are what we call closed 
systems, and as such are physically completely disconnected 
from one another: and if such is the case it would seem 
impossible to imagine the coincident consciousnesses of men 
bound together into a unified system. But upon second 
thought we are led to ask wherein consists the bond between 
the minor neural systems within the great neural system in 
any individual man; and when we ask this question we 
find that while it is easy to speak of the “‘ integration” of 
these systems, it is difficult to explain in what this “ inte- 
gration” consists. All that we are able to assert is that the 
minor systems are contiguous, and so connected that together 
they act as a unit. 
But evidently this contiguity and connectedness within the 
neural systems of individual men are of various grades, as 
the unification of the activity between the several minor 
systems is of different grades. We are led to note further- 
more that when, for instance, any of us touches thehand 
of a fellow man, the nerve terminals of his neural system 
are contiguous with, and active at the same time with, the 
corresponding nerve terminals of that fellow man ; and that 
his neural system and his neighbor’s neural system at such 
a moment form in a sense one still more complex neural 
system, in which there are two great minor systems in either 
of which may occur the inception of changes in grade of 
activity, but in which this inception of activity must affect 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 175 
both parts of, that is the whole of, what we may call the 
duplex system made up of the nervous systems of both the 
men. No action in the nervous system of one (A) of the 
two men (A and B), under such conditions of contact, can 
be without some effect upon the activity of the nervous 
system of the other man (B) ; nor can this action in the one 
man (A) fail to be influenced by the existing conditions of 
activity in the nervous system of that other man (B). 
Taking one step further we note that the nervous systems 
of two or more individuals living in the same physical 
environment may be connected by common stimulations, the 
most important of which are those of ocular, or of aural, 
nerve terminals, and by those signs and symbols of spoken 
and written language which are substituted for these stimu- 
lations, just as well as by the common stimulations of touch 
nerve terminals of which we have just spoken ; and we are 
thus led to see that after all it is not at all impossible to 
surmise that the individuals of social groups who are simi- 
larly constituted, and who are affected at the same time by 
the same stimuli from the environment, may be organically 
interrelated elements of a social body to which must be 
coincident a social consciousness. 
Sec. 3. If we assume then that we have in social groups 
such highly complex systems, physical and psychic, i.e. that 
social bodies and social consciousnesses exist ; nevertheless 
we cannot take such a position without making certain 
important reservations to avoid misunderstanding. 
We may note in the first place that the bond of unity 
between the different individual systems is of the very 
lightest kind, and one which is most easily broken ; so that 
social systems are likely to be ephemeral, systems of one 
form being constantly dissolved, and new systems constantly 
being formed. In other words, such social systems, and the 
coincident social consciousnesses, if they exist, must be of 
the very simplest type of organization, in which what we  
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
call the ‘‘ integration ” of the possible partial systems is of 
the very lowest grade. It is clear then that social organisms, 
if they exist, must in one aspect be of a grade comparable 
with those of the lowest forms of individual animal life, 
and not comparable in this aspect with human organisms. 
In the second place? it seems clear that it is improper to 
speak of the opinions of aggregates of men, as we compre- 
hend them, as constituting a ‘‘ social consciousness,” as our 
extreme sociologists are wont to do. For the conception of 
a social consciousness implies that the thoughts of men, as 
they are related to the whole pulse of the social conscious- 
ness, must correspond in the main with particular psychic 
elements or minor psychic systems in us, as these are related 
to the whole pulse of our own conscious life. Were the 
psychic elements which make the substance of our conscious 
life so loosely bound together, so fortuitously related, as 
are the thoughts of different men, we could certainly not 
believe that out of these more or less isolated and unsyste- 
matized psychic elements anything could rise correspondent 
to consciousness as we experience it. Only where we per- 
TAs I have said elsewhere (Instinct and Reason, page 191) if it be true 
that social aggregates are organic, and that this organic nature is of a low 
order, then it is clearly impossible that the hypothetical social body can be 
able to perform functions correspondent to those which in individual life 
are performed only in organic forms of a more highly integrated order. 
The hypothetical social body, if it exist, may indeed be counted on to 
perform the differential actions that relate to the lower forms of self- 
protection. If, however, we assume that this hypothetical social organism 
can perform great complex work correspondent to the higher grades of 
work done by a highly-organized human individual with all his parts 
thoroughly integrated, we must expect to find our assumption unverified ; 
we must expect the social functioning, thus attempted, to fail, because the 
aggregate in such directions will fail to act as an integrated unit, because 
it will easily lose its organic structure and become a mere cumbersome 
machine with parts working together in time, but without co-ordination 
and integration. 
2 Confer my Instinct and Reason, p. 189 and 190.
-P-A-G-E-191
  
  MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 177 
ceive close community of impulse, and partial identity of 
thought among large masses of men, can we imagine the 
existence of a social consciousness which is in any measure 
like human consciousness ; and even then this social con- 
sciousness must in the matter of integration be of a grade 
much lower than human consciousness as we know it. 
Furthermore, even if we suppose that a social conscious- 
ness does exist of which our thoughts are mere elements 
(and the probability of such existence I agree to), we cannot 
assume that our elemental thought can in any way grasp the 
content of this hypothetical social consciousness. As well 
might we expect the parts of our psychic life (say our sen- 
sations) to grasp the complex resultant which we call our 
consciousness. If there be a social consciousness of suf- 
ficiently high grade, corresponding in general form to our 
individual consciousness, it may know our thoughts as 
partial emphases, or presentations, much as we appreciate 
the existence of our own sensations and their elementary 
qualities ; and it may have means of expression that are 
effective for other consciousnesses of its own order; but 
we as elements of this wider consciousness can surely not 
be able to grasp even dimly the nature of that higher con- 
sciousness which, if it exist, must be determined by the pulse 
of thought of many interrelated individual consciousnesses. 
It is evident then that it is not proper to speak of the mere 
related concepts of the individuals composing social groups as 
in itself constituting a “social consciousness”’ the nature of 
which is revealed to us by a study of these related concepts. 
That social consciousnesses may exist, however, I do not 
think we are in a position to deny, although I thus protest 
against the careless identification of what we know as the 
thoughts of men with such social consciousnesses ; and 
although I believe that social consciousnesses must be of a 
type very different from human consciousnesses as we know 
them. 
M 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  178 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
An objection has been raised by Prof. Henry Sidgwick, 
which serves as a valid criticism of the ordinary conception 
of the social organism, in the fact*that individual men shift 
their allegiance, as it were, so readily from one group to 
another, or even belong to diverse social groups at one and 
the same time. But this fact does not affect adversely the 
conception here defended. It merely means that diverse 
social consciousnesses, in which there are common elements, 
may co-exist ; and this is quite compatible with our view 
of the nature of the individual human consciousness which, 
as we have seen, is really a broad system of minor conscious- 
nesses, which minor consciousnesses may, and in fact often 
do, contain common psychic elements, so that in human 
consciousness the same psychic elements may belong to 
diverse minor systems at different times, and at times to 
diverse minor systems at one and the same moment. 
Sec. 4. If we assert the probable existence of social 
organisms, and of social consciousnesses, of the nature thus 
attributed to them, then we are led to ask, on the one hand, 
whether, apart from the mere facts of contiguity and of the 
reciprocity of activities in the individuals constituting social 
aggregates, there is evidence of an objective kind of the 
existence of such social organisms; and whether, on the 
other hand, there is evidence of a subjective kind, in our 
own experience, of the existence of such social conscious- 
nesses. 
In looking for such objective evidence we naturally ask 
whether we discover any signs, other than those already 
noted, which indicate the existence of organic bonds between 
the individuals aggregated in social groups; and we are at 
once led to observe that we will have very strong ground 
for the assertion of the existence of such organic bonds if 
we find ourselves able to note any marked correspondence 
between the activities of the related parts of an individual 
organism, and the activities of the related individuals of
-P-A-G-E-193
MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 179 
social aggregates. Now just such evidence is at hand in 
the well-recognized fact that in many respects the activities 
of social aggregates correspond in form with those of. the 
activities of individuals ; and that these activities arise in 
the course of social development in an order corresponding 
to a great degree with the appearance of the like activities 
in the course of the development of the individual. Mr. 
Herbert Spencer, and others, have so fully presented. this 
evidence that I shall not weary the reader with repetition 
of the facts with which they are doubtless thoroughly 
familiar. : 
When we look for subjective evidence of the existence of 
social consciousnesses in which our human consciousnesses 
appear as elements,” we are led to see that if such broader 
social consciousnesses exist, then our own consciousnesses, 
when joining with others in the formation of a consciousness 
of more complex type, while retaining their own general 
qualities, must be assumed to be modified in the fact that 
they become part of the higher consciousness. 
We should not expect to gain any direct, definitely unique, 
experience as the result of becoming part of such a broader 
social consciousness: we should not expect, as we have said 
above, to be able to ‘‘ know ” this broader consciousness of 
which our pre-eminent consciousnesses are elementary parts ; 
but on the other hand, we might expect our consciousnesses, 
which in such cases are parts of a pre-eminent social con- 
sciousness, to have a “‘ feel,” to use James’ word, different 
from that given if they were isolated or temporarily discon- 
nected from the broader social consciousness ; and we might 
therefore expect to experience some difference of this ‘“‘ feel ” 
where our consciousnesses become parts of a higher system, 
and a further difference of ‘‘ feel” when this bond is dis- 
solved.

180 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
When we find ourselves in a great assemblage of enthusi- 
astic people whose minds are turned in some one special 
direction, we note a well-recognized change of experience. 
Such a change of my experience may not impossibly be due 
to this subsumption, for the time, of my limited conscious- 
ness in, and as part of, a higher consciousness ;—may be 
the nearest possible approach to the grasp by the individual 
consciousness of a social consciousness, if such can be sup- 
posed to exist. 
B 
Sec. 5. In all that has preceded this we have given our 
attention solely to the study of animal and vegetable life, 
and have left entirely unconsidered the possibility of the 
existence of any psychic life in correspondence with changes 
in inorganic matter. 
But, if we allow ourselves to consider such a view as that 
presented in section 9 of Chapter vi., we are led to ask 
why we should limit our analogical deductions to changes 
observed in that type of matter which we describe as proto- 
plasm; and we are then led further to surmise that something 
psychic may possibly correspond not merely with such trans- 
fers of energy as occur in protoplasmic matter, but with all 
transfers of energy, whether in living or non-living bodies, 
even though this psychic somewhat be of a nature which 
we can but little comprehend. 
This view which Paulsen refers back to Plato and Aris- 
totle, and traces in the thought of Spinoza and Leibnitz, 
Schelling and Schopenhauer and Lotze, and which was so 
clearly stated by Fechner, is in line with the ever diminishing 
distinction between organic and non-organic bodies with 
which the scientist is making us so familiar. It is a view 
which has been considered by the large body of conservative 
thinkers in the past as exceedingly imaginative, and not one 
to be taken too seriously: in the light of the general trend 
of modern theory as above considered, however, it surely  
-P-A-G-E-195
MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 181 
appears that it is at least worthy of our careful considera- 
tion. 
It seems highly probable, as Dr. Santayana has suggested,* 
that as human consciousness developed from what we may 
call a chaotic to a reflective form, when “‘ mind” first began 
to be differentiated from objects in the world, an uncritical 
ascription of mental life to all these objects was spontaneously 
and necessarily made. Of the notions thus evolved at this 
uncritical stage of intelligence we doubtless have reminis- 
cences, as it were, in the crude animism of the savage and 
the more logically expressed hylozoism of the early Greek 
philosophers. 
Gradually as reflection has clarified intelligence this 
ascription of mental life to the objects in nature has been 
abandoned, as a more consistent world view has seemed to 
be gained by this abandonment, and by the assumption of a 
purely mechanical view as to the nature of the inanimate 
objects in the outer world. But the ascription of mental 
life to other men and to certain of the higher animals has 
not been abandoned; rather on the contrary has it become 
very firmly established in our scheme of thought, and this 
just because the conception of the existence of other human 
consciousnesses (to pass over the assumed mental lives of 
the animals) happens to ‘‘ work,”—because in connection 
with the assumption of their existence we find it possible 
to coordinate the experiences of every day life. 
The fact that the animistic view has been so generally aban- 
doned, as man’s reason has become more highly developed, 
might suggest the possibility that a still further advance in 
our reflective life is likely to lead the individual to take the 
Cartesian step in relation to animal consciousness, and finally 
to cast off even the notion of the existence of other human 
consciousnesses than his own, and to rest satisfied in a com- 
plete solipsism. Such a suggestion is of course certain to 
1 Life of Reason, vol. i, chap. vi.
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
be promptly rejected by all of us; but in rejecting it we 
seem to see that man’s previous process of thought in the 
abandonment of the animistic view cannot be carried forward 
in a strictly logical manner ; and this leads us to ask whether 
we may not have been wrong in this total abandonment of 
this animistic view? whether the hylozoistic conception has 
not deserved better treatment? whether instead of rejecting 
it in favor of a purely mechanical interpretation of nature it 
were not more logical and rational to attempt to restate it 
in a form that will avoid those difficulties which have led 
us to look upon it as untenable? It appears to the writer 
that these questions must receive an affirmative answer. 
Sec. 6. As we have seen, it is one of the distinguishing 
characteristics of living organisms that they are composed of 
a unified aggregate of elements, which are so related in a 
system that no element can be modified without the produc- 
tion of some modification in all the other elements, and in 
the system as a whole ; and so related that the system as 
a whole can only be modified through the modification of 
its elements. 
But we have also reason to believe that mere physical 
elements within the universe are so related together that 
they form systems of various degrees of complexity, and 
of this very same nature ; that is, that elements within the 
physical universe are bound together in systems of greater 
or less complexity ; in which systems the elements are so 
related. that no one of them can be modified without the 
production of some measure of modification in all other 
elements of the system, and in the system as a whole ; and 
so related that the system as a whole can only be modified 
through the modification in some measure of each of its 
component elements. It thus appears that systems which 
are guasi organic may exist in aggregates of physical 
elements which are usually spoken of as inanimate and 
inorganic.
-P-A-G-E-197
  MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 183 
If then an organism can be said to exist in any aggregate 
of physical elements whenever there exists a reciprocity of 
reaction between the elements of the aggregate ; and if we 
agree to adopt the hypothesis that there is a thoroughgoing 
correspondence between psychic forms and transfers of 
physical energy, then there must be some type of conscious- 
ness corresponding with the types of inanimate systems 
above depicted. These consciousnesses must indeed be of 
forms very different from human consciousness as we know 
it ; and, in most cases likely to be considered, must be of 
forms which we would usually think of as of a very 
low degree of “‘ integration” in comparison with human 
consciousness. 
If now we consider in this broad way the universe as a 
whole, as inclusive of all that we usually speak of as organic 
and as inorganic, we perceive that it as a whole must be 
looked upon as a vast organic system. In it are various 
parts which are more or less complex systems within systems ; 
and, broadly speaking, all parts of this vast guasi system are 
in some measure related by a direct or derivative contiguity, 
and are subject to reciprocity of reaction, so that no element 
can react without in some measure affecting the activities 
of all the other parts of the vast organic system, and so that 
the reaction of any element is affected necessarily by the 
reactions of each and every one of the other innumerable 
parts of the whole vast system of the whole universe. 
If the suggestions of previous paragraphs are valid, 
correspondent with this vast organic universe, we are com- 
pelled to imagine the existence of a universal consciousness 
in which each psychic element affects every other, and is 
affected by every other. 
As I have said above, this conception, or conceptions 
closely allied thereto, have been reached by many thinkers 
approaching the subject from the most diverse standpoints. 
Let me quote two passages from lately published works by
-P-A-G-E-198
184 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
writers of eminence, in which this is exemplified. In his 
World and the Individual» Professor Josiah Royce tells us 
that ‘‘ we have no right whatever to speak of really uncon- 
scious Nature, but only of uncommunicative Nature, or of 
Nature whose mental processes go on at such different 
time-rates from ours that we cannot adjust ourselves to a 
live appreciation of their inward fluency, although our 
consciousness does make us aware of their presence. My 
(Professor Royce’s) hypothesis is that, in case of Nature in 
general, as in the case of the particular portions of Nature 
known as our fellow-men, we are dealing with phenomena 
of a vast conscious process, whose relation to time varies 
vastly, but whose general characteristics are throughout the 
same. From this point of view, evolution would be a series 
of processes suggesting to us various degrees and types of 
conscious processes. The processes, in case of so-called 
inorganic matter, are very remote from us; while in the 
case of the processes which appear to us as the expressive 
movements of the bodies of our human fellows, they are so 
near to our own inner processes that we understand what 
they mean. I suppose then that when you deal with Nature 
you deal with a vast realm of finite consciousness of which 
your own is at once a part and an example.” And in Mr. 
Stout’s Manual of Psychology we find the following 
words: ‘‘If the doctrine of psychophysical parallelism is 
true the reason of the connexion between conscious process 
and correlated nervous process is not to be found in the 
nervous and conscious processes themselves. Both must be 
regarded as belonging to a more comprehensive system of 
conditions ; and it is within this system as a whole that the 
reason of their connexion is to be sought. In particular 
the individual’s consciousness, as we know it, must be 
regarded as a fragment of a wider whole, by which its 
origin and its changes are determined. As the brain forms 
1Vol. ii. pp. 225 ff. 2 Chap. iii. sec. 4, pp. 51 ff.
-P-A-G-E-199
    MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 185 
only a fragmentary portion of the total system of material 
phenomena, so we must assume the stream of individual 
consciousness to be in like manner part of an immaterial 
system. We must further assume that this immaterial 
system in its totality is related to the material world in its 
totality as the individual consciousness is related to nervous 
processes taking place in the cortex of the brain.” 
Sec. 7. If the notions presented in the previous sections 
are warranted, then it appears clear that there must exist an 
enormous variety of consciousnesses corresponding with the 
enormous variety of types of systematization in the universe. 
These consciousnesses must vary in breadth and complexity ; 
and as certain minor systems within the whole vast physical 
system must be more closely systematized than others, so 
certain of these consciousnesses must be more closely 
E systematized,—more nearly closed systems,—more self- 
contained,—more individual,—than others. Human con- 
sciousnesses would, in this view, be special forms of such 
closely systematized,—self-contained,—individual,—psychic 
systems. 
Any individual thing would thus appear to be merely a 
special minor system within a broader system, which minor 
| system is at the time considered in and for itself, without 
relation to any broader system to which it may belong. In 
* fact under this view we can never mean more than this when 
we think of any individual thing, which when objectively 
considered is for us but a bundle of what we call activities, 
which are in fact merely emphatic activities within minor 
systems, which latter, if we take a broader view, are merely 
emphases of activity in minor systematized parts of broader 
active systems. 
What we describe as a system is thus an aggregate of 
interrelated individual elements, all of which are reciprocally 
efficient. The system is what it is because of the existence 
of the elements as thus related and efficient. The individual 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    186 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
element is what it is because in it the characteristics of the 
system may be emphasized and may thus become explicit. 
What we describe as an individual man would thus 
appear to be merely a special minor physical system within 
a broader physical system, which minor physical system we 
at the time consider in and for itself: and correspondingly 
each individual human consciousness would thus also appear 
to be merely a special minor psychic system within a broader 
psychic system, which minor psychic system we at the time 
consider in and for itself. 
An individual consciousness would thus, in a broad view, 
appear merely as an emphasis within a minor psychic system 
of a wider psychic system, without which it could not exist. 
Such a conception accords also with our experience of 
consciousness in reflection. For each specific presentation 
may be, and often is, considered as an individual presenta- 
tion. Yet in the preceding chapters we have come to see 
that such a specific presentation is given within the whole 
psychic system of the consciousness of the moment in which 
it appears ; and that such a specific presentation must be 
looked upon merely as an emphasis within this broad psychic 
system which we call consciousness, even as the special 
nervous activities which correspond with this presentation 
are to be considered merely as emphases of activity within 
the whole active nervous system. 
Sec. 8. It appears possible then to conceive that in this 
universe there are innumerable grades of consciousnesses, 
other than human consciousnesses. At times human con- 
sciousnesses may become inherent parts of such other forms 
of consciousness: and their existence might affect us by 
producing in us an alteration of what James would call our 
patech 
If such other forms of consciousness exist in the universe, 
not only may we at times, as we have just seen, become 
inherent parts of some of those of higher grade than ours ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
    MORE COMPLEX THAN HUMAN 187 
but it is also possible that at other times such diverse con- 
sciousnesses may merely attach themselves to ours, as it 
were, leaving our own consciousnesses essentially intact : 
but in such cases the other consciousnesses may serve to 
produce noticeable modifications in our own consciousnesses, 
and within the field of attention, which may point to 
influences from without such human consciousnesses as are 
familiar to us. 
All readers of this book are familiar with the voluminous 
records of facts made by Hodgson and others in connection 
with the Society for Psychical Research, and brought into 
prominence in Frederic Myers’s published works; facts 
which are more or less mysterious, and which not a few 
people think of as corroborative of that most vague of 
hypotheses, the spiritualistic, or spiritistic hypothesis as it 
is now called. 
Had these records been made twenty-five years ago they 
would have been immensely more voluminous, because they 
would have included accounts of what were then the most 
convincing pieces of evidence of this hypothesis, but what 
are now described as phenomena of multiple personality, 
automatic writing, etc., which if not thoroughly under- 
stood, have ‘surely been shown to bear no such interpretation 
,as that involved with the spiritistic hypothesis. So it seems 
\probable that in the near future many more of these recorded 
facts above spoken of will appear similarly explicable without 
resort to this spiritistic hypothesis. 
Of such of these facts as then remain unexplained, a very 
small part may be interpreted as fraudulent, but a very large 
"part indeed as due to perfectly honest but false judgments, 
or to illusions of forgetfulness, and especially to illusions of 
memory. 
The small remnant of these facts which still remain 
unexplained on well-established psychological principles, if 
they seem tangible enough to point to anything at all, will
-P-A-G-E-202
   
     188 CONSCIOUSNESSES OTHER THAN HUMAN 
surely not point to the existence of disembodied human 
spirits ; but rather to the existence of consciousnesses other 
than human consciousnesses similar to those of which we 
have just spoken ; consciousnesses, as we have said, of forms 
very different from those known to us in our own experience, 
but which may occasionally attach themselves to ours in such 
a way as to produce modifications of our consciousnesses 
which seem to point to influences from outside of such 
human forms of consciousness as are familiar to us ; con- 
sciousnesses so differently embodied that, in Royce’s words 
above quoted, ‘‘we can not adjust ourselves to, a live 
appreciation of their inward fluency, although our conscious- 
ness does make us aware of their presence.” 
I do not hesitate to agree that such influences may very 
probably affect us, and as evidence in favor of such a view 
I may quote the mature convictions of Professor William 
James, who will be acknowledged to be one of the most 
acute of introspectionists the world has known. Referring 
to certain early experiments of his he says:! ‘‘ One con- 
clusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and my 
impression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken. 
It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational con- 
sciousness as we call it, is but one special type ot conscious- 
ness ; whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of , 
screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely / 
different. We may go through life without suspecting 
their existence ; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at a 
touch they are there in all their completeness, definite types 
of mentality and adaptation. No account of the universe 
in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms of 
consciousness quite disregarded.”

THE GENERAL NATURE OF HUMAN 
PRESENTATIONS 
PART I 
GENERAL QUALITIES OF RELATION AROUSED IN 
CONNECTION WITH ALL PRESENTATIONS 
INTRODUCTION 
Sec. 1. In our studies in Book 1. we have seen that in 
each moment of man’s clear consciousness there appears a 
presentation to the Self. We have also seen that these 
presentations within consciousness may be looked upon as 
noetic emphases within a noetic system corresponding with 
neururgic emphases within an all active nervous system. 
We have seen that each of these presentations is new and 
unique, and that each is sui generis; and in Chapter tv., 
and especially in Appendix A, we have studied certain special 
types of these presentations which we have found to be 
disparate, yet classifiable according to certain characteristics 
determined by the integration of the minor noetic systems 
within which these presentations, viewed as noetic emphases, 
appear. 
In this Book we shall turn attention away from the special 
forms of these presentations, and considering their general 
nature as exemplified in these special forms, shall attempt 
to trace the general qualities which are common to them all.
-P-A-G-E-204
    190 GENERAL QUALITIES OF ALL PRESENTATIONS 
These general characteristics or qualities as given in 
experience must be known to us as forms of relational 
presentations of the broadest generality ; i.e. as “‘senses of 
relation” which would not exist but for the existence of the 
special presentations, but which appear apart from them, 
and in connection with each and every one of them. 
In seeking for these general characteristics or qualities of 
our complex presentations, we may note at the start that it 
is possible that certain qualities of this nature may belong 
to the hypothetical psychic elements of which consciousness 
is supposed to be formed: that is to say that these character- 
istics would be found to belong to the psychic elements if 
we could isolate them for purposes of examination and study, 
as is clearly impossible. These elemental general qualities, 
if such there be, can of course be known only as they appear 
in the complex presentations given to us in reflection, and 
at first sight it would appear impossible to determine by 
reference to reflection the nature of these elemental psychic 
forms. But it appears that by consideration of the neururgic 
analogue of consciousness we may be able to conceive of 
certain general characteristics which must necessarily belong 
to the activities of neural elements, if we suppose such to 
be isolated and still to live and remain active ; and we are 
then prepared to look for the psychic correspondents of these 
general neururgic characteristics in general qualities of the 
complex presentations which we are able to observe. 
Beside these elemental general qualities it is highly 
probable that certain general qualities, which could not 
appear in connection with psychic elements if they were 
isolable, will appear as the result of the systematization of 
these hypothetical psychic elements which yields conscious- 
ness as we experience it. If then we find ourselves able 
to discover certain general elemental psychic qualities, we 
may look for other general qualities of the same general 
nature, which however are not elemental but determined by
-P-A-G-E-205
  
INTRODUCTION 1g 
the combination of psychic elements to form consciousness as 
we experience it. If we find such, then we shall have before 
us for our study certain great groups of general qualities. 
Sec. 2. Assuming that we do find such groups of general 
qualities, we note that each of the qualities in each of the 
groups, inasmuch as they are general qualities, must be ever 
present in some phase in each complex presentation. But 
so far as these phases differ, a certain definite number of 
relations between these general qualities themselves must be 
possible, which will be likely to produce a corresponding 
definite number of special forms of ‘‘senses of relation” 
attaching to the presentations in connection with which they 
occur. Such special forms of relational presentation we are 
therefore bound to look for, in case we are able to discover 
the groups of general qualities above referred to. 
Sec. 3. Throughout our quest we must never allow 
ourselves to forget that presentations are but emphases in 
a vastly complex psychic system, and that we can in no case 
afford to overlook the influence upon the presentations of 
the unemphasized parts of the psychic system. We must 
therefore be prepared to observe special differentiations of 
the forms of these general qualities of presentations due to 
the greater or less influence of the whole psychic system 
upon them. 
But as we have seen in Chapter mt. the efficiency of the 
unemphasized psychic system, when it becomes presenta- 
tively explicit, is given in the appreciation of the efficient 
empirical ego, which appears as a presentative simulacrum 
of the non-presentable Self. In our studies in this Book 
therefore we must be prepared to find evidence of ‘the 
efficiency of the empirical ego in relation to the general 
qualities of all presentations which we seek to discover, and 
in relation to all the immediate derivations of these general 
qualities referred to in Sec. 2.

CHAPTER VIII 
INTENSITY 
I 
Sec. 1. As we have said in the Introduction, it is pos- 
sible that there may exist certain general qualities of all 
presentations of such a nature that in modified form they 
would appear in connection with psychic elements if we 
could isolate such elements ; general qualities which can of 
course be appreciated only as transformed in the complex 
presentations given to us in experience in which psychic 
elements are systematized, but which as thus appearing we 
might expect to show evidence of their elemental character. 
Sec. 2. When we consider the conditions existing within 
a neural element we note that the form of its elemental 
activity, as objectively viewed, must 
greater or less degree of this activity : be changed by the 
and this must mean 
that the degree of activity must give to the elemental 
neururgic form a special characteristic, or quality, which 
involves the relation of more or less. So long as a neural \ 
\ | 
:
-P-A-G-E-207

element is such, in the fact that it is a living thing, it cer- 
tainly must be more or less active. In the nervous system 
as we know it the elemental activities are of course modi- 
fied in the fact that the elements are parts of a nervous 
system ; but the neural elements still have a life of their 
own, a partial autonomy if we may so speak; and their 
greater or less activity is measurable to some extent by 
purely objective means, but more especially by comparison 
with the activities of other special elements, or with the 
activities of the system as a whole. To this we refer more 
fully below. : 
Sec. 3. The question before us then is whether we 
experience in our complex presentations, or noetic emphases, 
any general quality which corresponds with this degree of 
activity of the neural element, as this is observed in the 
activity of the whole neural system, which as we have seen 
gives us a general characteristic of neururgic emphases. 
The reader will I think at once agree that experience points 
to the existence of such a quality in what we call Intensity. 
Titchener? asks ‘“‘Why is quality the ‘ individualizing’ attri- 
bute? Why are not the different intensities of a given 
pitch ‘ different sensations’?” He finds no answer “in 
strict logic.” But under the view here presented the answer 
is clear. Intensity is not an “ individualizing ” attribute just 
because it is a general quality of all presentations. “ Quality”’ 
on the other hand is diverse in each presentation, each pre- 
sentation being sui generis as we have already seen. 
It will be generally agreed that all of our sensational 
experiences are more or less intense ; nor do I imagine that 
any one will deny that our emotions always display more 
or less of intensity: and the same may be said without 
hesitation I think of those conative states, desire and 
impulse, which in certain respects have so close a relation 
to our emotions. The “sense of effort” which has its

  194 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
outcome in the will act is evidently also always more or less 
intense. 
We acknowledge thus that more or less of intensity is 
always displayed in connection with our receptive and 
reactive presentations, but it is not so generally agreed that 
those presentations which we speak of as thoughts, and con- 
cepts, and percepts, are in themselves always more or less 
intense. We do not usually think of “ object-in-the-outer- 
world” presentations as more or less intense: but this is 
because we always appreciate implicitly the complexity of 
percepts, and tend to differentiate their separable parts in 
which these intensities appear ; no one surely would hesitate 
to agree that these differentiable parts are always more or 
less intense. But beyond this, if we consider percepts as 
wholes, we must agree that even they may be looked upon 
as more or less intense just as their differentiable parts appear 
as more or less intense. The percept corresponding with 
the man appearing before me in the bright sunlight is, as a 
whole, appreciated as more intense than that of another man 
who is protecting himself from the heat by standing in the 
deep shadow. 
In the study of percepts in this regard however we find 
difficulty in avoiding the consideration of phenomena of 
attention to be treated in a later chapter. This difficulty 
becomes more marked when we think of those presentations 
which we speak of as concepts and thoughts in general, and 
which are recognized to be of a highly complex nature : 
but even here, if we agree that what we call vividness is a 
special kind of intensity, then we must also agree that if we 
think of these presentations as wholes they also are always 
more or less intense, even as their differentiable parts are 
more or less intense. Let us consider briefly this relation of 
intensity to vividness. 
Sec. 4. Much has been made in late years of the dis- 
tinction between intensity, and vividness or clearness, which
-P-A-G-E-209
  INTENSITY 195 
attracts our notice in the study of attention to be considered 
later! But it appears clear to the writer that the distinction 
is merely one made between intensities of different types. 
Most of the studies of our psycho-physicists in this direction 
are given to sensational intensities, and in this field they 
observe intensity as contrasted with clearness, vividness, 
distinctness, but fail to take sufficient note of the fact that 
this contrast appears in other realms than the sensational. 
One who does so must at once concede that the distinction 
is one that is most commonly, and very frequently, observed 
in cases where sensations are compared with ideational 
presentations; and that the sensations which are called vivid, 
in distinction from the sensations called intense, are closely 
allied with ideational presentations. It seems to me that the 
frequent exper ences of this comparison between sensational 
and ideational presentations in every day life give the basis 
for the distinction considered when careful laboratory tests 
are made. 
Where intensities of diverse types of presentations appear 
coincidently we should surely not be surprised to find them 
contrasted and given different names. An elemental intensity 
corresponds with an emphasis of activity within a part of the 
nervous system, and such emphases are more likely to be 
distinctly marked in those parts of the nervous system which 
1Cf, Pillsbury, Attention, chap. i. It is true, as Titchener says (0. cit. 
p- 219), that “a very weak sound may be as clear as a very loud sound” : 
but here we are dealing with a phenomenon of attention to which we refer 
later. 
2Mr. Boris Sidis (Psychological Review, xv. 2, p. 111) holds that “Sensa- 
tions have intensity but no vividness; images or representations have 
vividness but no intensity.” He must agree however that both these 
psychical characteristics are determined by degrees of neural activity, and he 
might therefore well give them one name X, holding that sensational X is 
to be called intensity, and representative X is to be called vividness. The 
difference between his record of introspection and my own is therefore 
merely a verbal one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
    196 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
receive stimuli directly from the environment than in parts 
which receive their stimuli from within the system itself. As 
the emphatic activities in the nervous parts which are in 
direct relation to the environment. correspond with our 
sensations we should expect to make note of intensities most 
frequently in connection with sensations, as is evidently the 
case; and we should find ourselves naturally considering 
sensational intensities when the thought of the meaning of 
the word intensity occurs. If then we are inclined to give 
special names to intensities as attached to special classes of 
presentations we should naturally use the word intensity to 
refer to sensation, and choose a special name to apply to the 
intensities of a less narrow nature which are due to action 
within the mass of the psychic system, when the two forms 
are placed in contradistinction. And this we do in setting 
“intensity ” over against ‘“ vividness” or “clearness.” 
The meaning of this may be more clearly seen if we 
consider in some detail the contrast between sensational 
and ideational intensities. An intense presentation appears 
within some minor psychic system. This minor psychic 
system may be of greater or less breadth. It is to be 
expected therefore that comparison will at times be made 
between an intensity within a narrow minor psychic system 
and an intensity within a broad minor psychic system. It 
may well happen also that the intensity (A) which is related 
with the narrow system may be one which is strongly 
influenced by the action of physical stimuli, and not markedly 
affected by the reaction of the related psychic system as a 
whole: while on the other hand the intensity (B), which is 
related with the broad system, may be one which exists as 
such almost entirely because of the reaction upon it of the 
psychic system as a whole with which it is related. (A) may 
well be a marked case of what men usually, but inaccurately 
as we shall presently see, speak of as involuntary attention : 
e.g. the light of the candle upon which my eyes are fixed,— 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    INTENSITY 197 
_ the twinge of neuralgic toothache caused by the stimulation 
of an exposed nerve. (B) may well be a marked case of what 
we all agree to call marked voluntary attention, provided 
the intensity is related with, and supported by, the broad 
mass of the psychic system as a whole,—i.e. by the Self. 
Now two such intensities may well appear at what seems 
to be one and the same moment; and we should not be 
surprised to find their contrast leading us occasionally to 
give them different names, as we have seen we do, using the 
term intensity to refer to the narrower sensational intensity, 
and the word vividness to refer to the broader ideational 
intensity. Vivid B, and intense A as differentiated from B, 
are both partial presentations. The characteristic of the 
vivid B is this ;—that at the moment observed it persists in 
attention notwithstanding the fact that when both A and B 
are held in reflection, and compared, B is appreciated as less 
intense than A; so that we speak then of the intense 
content A as contrasted with the vivid content B. What we 
note in this moment of comparison in reflection is the fact that 
attention becomes fixed upon A (the so-called intense 
element) as more emphatic than B (the so-called vivid 
element), and that in that moment, B tends to disappear 
from attention, while A tends to persist. But at the same 
time we also note that apart from this moment of reflective 
comparison the reverse is the case, i.e. the “‘vivid”’ B holds 
attention as against the “intense” A. We often experience 
cases where attention to partial presentation A becomes 
approximately equivalent to attention to partial presentation 
B. It is in such cases of balanced attention that the psychic 
system is appreciated as reacting to fasten B in attention to 
the exclusion of A, or in other words to sustain the “ vivid- 
ness” of B to the exclusion of the importance of the 
“intense” A.

to his acting: but the relatively unimportant psychic systems

pared with the very broad and important psychic systems 
involved in the acting of his part in the play, may lead him 
to say that while the toothache was more intense, the con- 
ception of his part in the play was more vivid. In the one 
case the intensity was due to a physical stimulus and 
involved relations with relatively narrow psychic systems ; 
in the other case it was the reaction of the mass of the broad 
psychic system that gave the importance to the psychic 
element and gave it its intensity, which in such cases we call 
its vividness, or clearness, as you will. 
Sec. 5. Before we go further we may well remind our- 
selves that when intensity is recognized as such, it is 
appreciated in reflection in itself because of the appearance 
of a specific presentation, a special “sense of relation,” 
which is as definite a presentation in reflection as is any 
other of those “senses of relation” of which we have spoken 
above. When we recognize an intensity it is because this 
special “sense of relation” is given at the moment. 
The intensity of any given presentation, or psychic part, is 
appreciated as more or less by comparison with the intensities 
of other special psychic parts, or with the intensity of the 
field of attention as a whole, as this field is considered in 
reflection. It is known to us only in the fact that the 
presentation in which it is observed appears in a special 
form, viz. as part of a more complex presentation: and it 
is measurable only in the fact that, as such, its degree of 
intensity is placed over against, and in comparison with, the 
1“Clearness” and “distinctness” are sharply differentiated by certain 
authorities. This distinction may be maintained without opposition to 
the view here held, that “vividness,” and “clearness,” and “distinctness,” 
are special forms of intensity. Confer Bentley, Mind, N.S. 5, pp. 242 ff. for 
a summary of views of authorities on this point, and an interesting discus- 
sion of them, 2

degree of intensity of some other partial presentation within 
the total complex, or with the general grade of intensity of 
this total complex. In other words, in making this com- 
parison of intensities we are dealing with a presentation of 
triple emphasis;* in which emphasis (1) is the “sense of 
relation” called the intensity involved in a; emphasis (2) 
being the “sense of relation”’ called the intensity involved 
in b; while emphasis (3) is still another and very special 
“sense of relation” which arises in connection with (1) and 
(2), and which we describe by saying that the intensity of a 
is greater than the intensity of 4, or vice versa. 
This being the case it is not surprising that the comparison 
of intensities may be made in relation to the most diverse of 
partial presentations. For instance ¢ and } may be as 
diverse as light and sound ;—the intensity of this brilliant 
light may be compared with the just noticeable intensity of 
that sound.? Again a and 4 may both be what we call 
revivals of past states: the weight of this disk which was in 
my hand a moment ago may appear as a secondary presenta- 
tion and may be compared with the revival of the weight of 
the disk handed to me by the experimenter five minutes ago. 
Or one of the two may be what we call a revival of a 
past state, and the other what we call the memory-after- 
image of what we speak of as in the present: as when I 
compare the intensity of the just gone sound of a musician’s 
violin in the rendering of a given melody with the intensity 
1 Confer Chap. v. Part 11. 
2Royce in his Outlines of Psycholgy, p. 137, says; “Ideally speaking, 
sensations or sensory experiences of any sort can be exactly compared in 
intensity only in so far as they very closely agree in quality. Thus it is 
impossible to say whether a given sensory experience of weight is more 
intense in its heaviness than a given sound is intense in its loudness.” It is 
however only the closely alike degrees of intensity that we find thus difficult 
to distinguish ; for certainly we do easily compare the intensities of presen- 
tations whose quality is as diverse as sound and light, provided the light be 
very brilliant and the sound just noticeable, or vice versa.
-P-A-G-E-214
  200 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
of the corresponding note in the rendering of another 
violinist heard last week. 
In certain cases however an intensity may appear to be 
recognized in itself without such comparison as we have 
been describing. The extreme intensity of a given sound 
for instance may be considered in itself without any thought 
that it is louder or less loud than any other sound. In such 
cases the intensity of the presentation which is markedly 
intense is placed over against, and measured in relation to, 
the revival of the conditions of emphasis in a more normal 
state. 
II 
Sec. 6. We may now turn to certain considerations of 
especial interest which have relation to the fact that this 
general quality, as we note it, is not the elemental quality 
which corresponds with the degree of activity in the neural 
element. What we appreciate as intensity is a transformation 
of a general quality which inheres in psychic elements, a 
transformation due to the fact that many noetic elements 
are systematized in each presentation that is given in our 
experience. This elemental general quality which in its 
purity, so to speak, is not given in reflection, we may speak 
of as ‘‘elemental intensity’ as distinguished from intensity 
proper as experienced. 
Now the fact that the general quality intensity as experi- 
enced in reflection is a transformation of this elemental 
intensity, which is not in itself given untransformed in 
experience, might be expected to result in the appearance of 
1 According to Wundt intensive magnitudes are of two kinds; qualitative 
gradation, and degree of strength. But the reader will observe that under 
my view, as stated in Chapter rv. and in Appendix A, this distinction does 
not appear to be appropriate, inasmuch as the “quality” of the presentation 
is a special characteristic ; while the intensity is a general characteristic of 
all presentations.
-P-A-G-E-215
INTENSITY 201 
certain interesting phenomena where successive intensities are 
observed: and I think it will appear in what follows that 
such phenomena are given and have attracted much attention 
among psychologists. 
Sec. 7. If we step from darkness into a brilliantly lighted 
room we are blinded, but in the course of a few moments 
find the intensity of the light no longer noticeable: or if 
we step into a rolling mill we are deafened at first, but soon 
find ourselves hearing other sounds than the roar of the 
machinery. The nervous activities coincident with the 
experience of the brilliant light and loud sounds have not 
been decreased, and therefore the elemental intensities cannot 
have decreased; but the appreciation of these elemental 
intensities has been decreased in proportion as the whole 
nervous system has accommodated itself to its new con- 
ditions. 
This means that an intensity cannot be appreciated as 
maintained of equal degree in successive moments unless the 
elemental intensity is actually increased. And this we 
should expect to be the case: for the high degree of activity 
in the neural part corresponding with the intense presenta- 
tion will be gradually spread throughout the nervous system, 
and unless the activity of the neural part is still further 
increased this increase of activity in the whole system will 
lead to a loss of emphasis of the part in the whole neururgic 
pattern ; and this must be attended by a corresponding loss 
of the appreciation of presentative intensity. If this appre- 
ciation of intensity is to be maintained it will therefore be 
necessary to increase the elemental intensity, which can only 
result provided the elemental nervous activity is increased. 
This point will appear of importance in our study of 
attention in a later chapter. 
Sec. 8. As the result of many observations we have come 
to believe that, in general, increases or decreases of intensity 
correspond with increases or decreases in the degree of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
202 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
activity of certain nervous parts. But it is a well recognized 
fact that certain situations occur which we believe must neces- 
sarily involve increases and decreases in the degree of neural 
activity which do not carry with them noticeable differences 
of intensity. Apart from sudden changes caused by shifting 
clouds there is no appreciation of a change of intensity in 
the daylight from morning to evening, although it is very 
evident that the nervous activities due to the stimulation of 
the eye increase from dawn to noon, and decrease from 
noon to sunset. Here there exist in us differences of 
nervous activity, and to these must correspond differences 
of elemental intensity, which however are not noted. 
But at once we are led to observe that the facts with 
which we are here dealing relate to the discernment of 
intensities, to use Stout’s word, and not to the question 
of their existence. The e/emensal intensity in the first place 
is, as we have noted, never experienced as such in the 
systemic presentations of reflection. The discernment of 
elementary intensities involves their transformation before 
they can appear to us as intensities; and upon consideration 
it appears clear that changes in elemental intensity need not 
necessarily involve this transformation. 
The recognition of change of intensity involves, as we 
have already seen, the production of a special “sense of 
relation” —of a special wave upon our symbolic noetic 
surface ; and this must correspond with the production of 
a special neururgic wave upon our symbolic neururgic 
surface. It is true also that such a special neururgic wave 
must be due to the increase or decrease of activities in special 
neural parts ; but it is clear that if all parts of the nervous 
system be supposed to be coordinately increased or decreased 
in activity, then although the whole neururgic surface will 
rise or fall, it will nevertheless remain placid ;—no special 
wave form will appear upon it because of the increased or 
decreased elemental activities. So also if the elemental
-P-A-G-E-217
      i | INTENSITY 203 
j intensity of all parts of the field of attention is coordinately 
increased or decreased, the whole of this field will appear as 
more or less efficient ; but no special noetic wave will appear 
upon the noetic surface,—no special development of the 
intensity “sense of relation” will occur,—because of the 
increased or decreased elemental intensities which must be 
supposed to correspond with the general increase or decrease 
of activity in the nervous system involved. 
Of course it is impossible to experience any case where 
the increases or decreases of activity in all parts of the 
nervous system are as fully equalized as has been above 
suggested: but surely we may expect to experience an 
approximation to such a case. We are thoroughly prepared 
therefore to find, as we have seen we do find, cases where 
differences of elemental intensity are not noticed; and the 
facts before us are properly expressed in psychological 
language by saying that very gradual increases or decreases 
of elemental intensity do not produce presentations which 
involve the recognition of intensity ;—do not lead to 
sufficient emphasis in the psychic parts involved to set them 
off against the whole mass of the psychic system, and do not 
give rise to the intensity “sense of relation.” 
Sec. 9. We may now turn to the consideration of certain 
equally well recognized cases where distinctly different 
degrees of intensity correspond with what we feel reasonably 
certain must be equal degrees of activity in the special 
nervous parts concerned. If we awaken from sleep at 
midnight and look at the north star through a clear atmo- 
sphere we are apt to think “how very bright it appears 
to-night.” But whenever we look through a clear atmo- 
sphere at the celestial pole the very same amount of light 
reaches us from this star, whether at midnight, or in the 
twilight hours when the star appears dim, or at midday 
when we are unable to note it at all. If the same amount 
of light reaches the eye in all such cases, then we must 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
  204 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
assume that the parts of the nervous system which are 
aroused by this amount of light to a certain degree of 
activity at midnight are aroused by it to approximately the 
same degree of activity in the twilight hour when the degree 
of the intensity of the sensations involved is very much 
decreased, and at midday when no increase of light intensity 
is noticeable in connection with this ocular stimulation. 
In the light of the considerations presented above we see 
that we should be led to expect to observe just such 
phenomena as those described above; for evidently any 
given degree of activity in a definite part of the nervous 
system can produce an observable increment to the activity 
of the whole nervous system only so far as the degree of 
activity of the part is great enough to be more or less sharply 
contrasted with that of the system as a whole, or of the 
minor systems adjacent to the part under consideration. 
Where the activity of the whole nervous system is of 
relatively low degree (as is the case when we awaken at 
midnight) then a given degree of activity in a special neural 
part may stand in strong contrast from,—may involve a 
distinct increment to,—the activities of the whole nervous 
system. But when the activity of the whole nervous system 
is of very high degree (as it is when we are fully awake and 
active at midday) then this same given degree of activity in 
the special neural part may fail altogether to stand in 
contrast from,—may involve no observable increment to,— 
the activities of the whole nervous system. And further- 
more as there are an indefinite number of gradations between 
the lowest possible and the highest possible degrees of 
activity in the nervous system as a whole ; so there must be 
an indefinite number of different degrees of contrast between 
the system’s activity, and an activity of a given degree in a 
part of the system. 
It thus appears that the degree of activity of a nervous 
part which enables this part to produce an increment of more  
-P-A-G-E-219
  INTENSITY "205 
or less prominence in the neururgic pattern of the moment 
is altogether a relative matter; and correspondingly the 
degree of emphasis of a psychic part which enables this part 
to produce a presentation in the noetic pattern of the . 
moment is altogether a relative matter. And unless such a 
presentation in the noetic pattern does occur we cannot 
experience the special resultant ‘sense of relation” which 
we describe as the apprehension of an intensity; and we 
should expect therefore to find that while the intensity of 
given psychic elements is fixed by the amount of activity of 
some corresponding neural part or parts, our power of discern- 
ment of this intensity will be relative to the condition of the 
activity, so to speak, of the whole psychic system,—of 
consciousness as a whole. 
Sec. 10. But if distinctly different degrees of intensity at 
times correspond with equal degrees of activity in the 
nervous parts concerned ; it is equally true that degrees of 
intensity which are appreciated as equal at times correspond 
with very different degrees of activity in the nervous parts 
concerned. And here we turn to the consideration of 
certain facts in relation to the quality of intensity which have 
been brought into great prominence by the able psycholo- 
gists of our time. With these facts we shall deal very 
briefly, referring the student to other text books for all 
details ; and this for the reason that if we are to take a 
broad view of the field of presentation as a whole we must 
not allow ourselves to concentrate our attention to any great 
degree upon what are really from our point of view but 
details of minor importance. 
Sec. 11. 1st. If we are subject to continuously increasing 
stimuli, which we must assume to arouse corresponding 
increasing degrees of activity in the nervous parts stimu- 
lated, we observe certain facts which may be illustrated by 
recalling one’s experiences when on a bright moonlight 
evening one awaits the illumination of an “electric tower,”
-P-A-G-E-220
206 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
which is effected by the very gradual and continuous increase 
of the electric power sent through the wires supplying the 
small lamps distributed over the whole of the tower surfaces. 
The signal is given for the turning on of the electric power, 
but some moments elapse during which we note no change 
whatever in the appearance of the tower. We know that 
each little lamp is beginning to emit some rays of light, but 
we cannot appreciate it by any change in our sensations ; 
nevertheless it is evident that if the lamps are glowing our 
eyes must be receiving from them certain stimuli which are 
producing increased ocular activity. 
Suddenly we note a faint pink glow on the surfaces which 
appear fore-shortened in perspective, and where therefore 
the little lamps are brought close together in our angle of 
vision: but the surfaces of the tower which face us are still 
white in the moonlight. Suddenly again, these faces also 
assume this faint pink glow; and then the light increases 
very gradually until it has reached its maximum of brilliancy. 
Until the sudden appearance of the first faint pink glow 
there was no noticeable presentation which involved the 
appreciation of this glow; but, if a neururgic and noetic 
correspondence exists and is thoroughgoing, there must 
have been some change in consciousness as soon as the first 
ray of light was emitted by the little bulbs, even though 
this change was not appreciated. 
Facts of this nature point to the existence of changes 
in consciousness which exist even though they are not 
appreciated as changes of intensity. This is acknowledged, 
although usually unwittingly, by all those who speak of the 
moment when sensations pass the “threshold of conscious- 
ness,” for in this use of terms they imply a something 
psychic below the “ threshold.” 
The explanation of the existence of the “ threshold” in 
terms of our conceptions is not far to seek. We have 
here not a threshold of consciousness, but a “threshold | 
\
-P-A-G-E-221
  INTENSITY 207 
of discernment,” i.e. of discernment of intensity. A certain 
degree of increased activity in a part of the whole nervous 
system is necessary before the activity of this part will 
appear as an increment to the activity of the whole nervous 
system,—before a noticeable alternation of the prevailing 
neururgic pattern will arise. So we should expect to find 
that a corresponding degree of increased intensity in a 
sensation, which is but a part of the whole psychic system, 
is necessary before the more intense sensation will appear 
as a presentation to the whole psychic system, before a 
discernible alteration of the prevailing noetic pattern will 
accrue, before therefore the special “sense of relation” 
can appear which carries with it the recognition of a degree 
of intensity. 
Sec. 12. 2nd. We are here led to note the fact, which 
has greatly interested the psychological world during the past 
generation, that we have not one, but really an indefinite 
number of “thresholds” of intensity, and that the amount 
of stimulation necessary to enable us to pass from one plane 
of intensity, so to speak, to another varies in a fairly 
definite way, as the amount of the stimulus varies. This 
seems to be a proper, even if it is a somewhat unusual, 
description of the facts which have led to the formulation 
of what Fechner so modestly insisted upon calling Weber’s 
law. It is now a commonplace observation that if a certain 
stimulation a is necessary to raise an intensity A of a 
given presentation to a higher intensity B; then a greater 
amount of stimulation (2+) is necessary to raise the 
intensity B to the greater intensity C, although the amount 
of increase of intensity from A to B is apparently the same 
as the amount of increase from B to C. 
Fechner as the reader knows made an enormous number 
of experiments (over 76,000 we are told) to establish a law 
in relation to these changes, and finally concluded that 
the intensity of sensations varies in the same ratio as
-P-A-G-E-222
208 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
the logarithms of their respective stimuli. This law has 
been subject to much discussion, and many attempts have 
been made to restate it in a form which will thoroughly 
accord with the facts brought out by experiment. One 
of the latest of these restatements is that of Lloyd Morgan, 
who puts it thus: “To determine equal increments of 
sensation there are required increments of stimulus in 
geometrical progression.” But we are not here concerned 
with the exact formulation of this law, which by general 
agreement holds only within certain wide limits; rather are 
we concerned with the general fact that what appear as 
equal increases of intensity in a given case require ever 
increasing amounts of the particular stimulation which calls 
forth these equal increases of intensity; and with the 
interpretation of this fact in terms of what we know 
concerning the activity of the nervous system. 
Sec. 13. When we turn to this consideration we recall 
that in an earlier chapter we have shown that we must 
agree that each presentation must be new and unique, and 
we therefore note that what we call a discernible change 
of intensity of a given presentation (A) involves the 
appearance of what is really a new presentation (A?) of 
higher intensity than (A); and when thus viewed we are 
led to see that a proper consideration of the nature of 
the activities of the nervous system as a whole should 
have led us to expect to find the facts here considered . 
exactly as we find them. 
Let us suppose ourselves standing by a small pool of water 
the still surface of which mirrors the sky above. If now we 
throw little pebbles at regular intervals into the pool little 
waves will ruffle its surface, and the disturbance of the whole 
surface will gradually increase as each additional pebble is 
thrown in. But presently we notice no change in the agita- 
tion of the surface as the pebbles are thrown: we find that 
larger stones must be thrown in if a change in the agitation 
   
-P-A-G-E-223
    
INTENSITY 209 
| of the surface is to be noted. And we discover. that’ larger 
and still larger stones must be successively thrown into the 
pool if we fre to continue to notice equal increases of 
agitation of the surface. 
If an increase of activity of a definite and sufficient amount 
_ appears in a part of the nervous system due to a definite 
increase of the stimulation of this part, this increased activity 
of the part will appear as an addition of activity to the 
neururgic system taken as a whole. This activity of the 
part however will gradually spread its influence throughout 
the system, which as a result will gradually become more 
and more active as a whole. Under such conditions the 
above-mentioned definite increased stimulation of a special 
part, while it still produces a coordinate increased activity of 
the part affected, will produce‘an activity which presently no 
longer stands in contrast with the activity of the whole 
system, as a neururgic increment. If now a neururgic incre- 
ment in the part is to be produced equal in proportion to 
that noted when the system as a whole was more quiescent, 
then a higher than the first degree of stimulation must reach 
the part, and a higher than the first degree of activity must 
be induced in this part. 
We thus see that if presentations in consciousness corre- 
spond with increments of activity in parts of the nervous 
system, then equally discernible changes in the intensity of 
a given presentation must involve augmented increases of 
stimulation to the nervous parts whose activity corresponds 
with the presentation in question ; and we should expect to 
find it true in a general way that “to determine equal 
increments of sensation there are required increments of 
stimulus in geometrical progression.” 
Sec. 14. 3rd. We may now turn from these broad con- 
siderations to some aspects of the discrimination of intensities 
which are less easy to explain. We have noted that where 
stimulations, as measured mechanically, increase regularly 
°  
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
and gradually (which theoretically involves gradually in- | 
creasing elemental intensities)—our power of discrimination 
of increases of intensity fails altogether where the increase 
of stimulation is very gradual; and. especially that where 
this discrimination is made it is noted not as gradual but 
as arising as it were by steps and bounds; and we have seen 
reason to believe that these noetic relations correspond in 
general with similar neururgic relations. 
But why these steps? Why should not every increased 
degree of stimulation have its corresponding discriminable 
increase of intensity? Or to put the problem in another 
form ; if we fail altogether to notice certain very gradual 
increases of intensity, as we have seen is the case, why are 
any increases of intensity ever noted? Why do increases 
of intensity ever result in the appearance of the general 
intensity “sense of relation” as a presentation? Why 
should the element of time, as involved with the greater or 
less rapidity of the change, thus enter in to make this vast 
difference in our conscious experience? The continuous 
increase in degree of stimulation is the same in both cases ; 
and why then should the time during which this increase 
takes place make all the difference between no discrimination 
of difference of intensity, and the most vivid of such dis- 
criminations ? 
It must be acknowledged at once that this problem is very 
easily confounded with the problems connected with the 
shiftings of attention which we shall discuss in a later 
chapter: but that it is a problem apart from attention is 
shown in the fact that there are certain cases, e.g. those which 
are commonly considered by the laboratory student, where 
attention is concentrated, and even expectant, and where the 
intensity quality appears as the simplest of presentations, 
where in other words confusion with the problem of atten- 
tion is not involved. But it is in these experiments that the 
phenomenon we are here considering appears most marked :
-P-A-G-E-225
    
INTENSITY aut 
) the discrimination of increases of intensity is given in certain 
discontinuous movements when the increase of stimulation 
is known to be mechanically continuous. 
It would seem to be most natural to assume that the 
continuously increasing stimulation, while involving some 
increase of nervous activity, does not produce continuously 
increasing degrees of nervous activity, but that this neururgic 
increase also proceeds by steps as does our power of the 
discrimination of intensity. As our psycho-physicists have 
noted, the power of discriminating small degrees of unlike- 
ness is greatly improved by practice, a fact which not only 
shows that there is great variability in the various “thresholds 
of discernment” but also seems to indicate that there must 
be some physiological change of condition in coincidence 
with the practice: and if the basis of these “steps” is 
neurological, it is easy to see that practice might change the 
length of the neurological steps, if we may so speak, to 
which changes of discrimination correspond. 
Some psycho-physicists of importance! have assumed 
however, and I cannot but think without due warrant, that 
the increases of nervous activity are as continuous as are the 
increases of degree of stimulation, and that the lack of 
continuity is to be discovered only in our conscious experi- 
ence. They have thus practically claimed that the process 
is a psychological one only, and that there is no corre- 
spondence in the neururgic process. If this view could be 
maintained it might be held to militate against the doctrine 
that noetic and neururgic correspondences are thorough- 
going. It is a satisfaction therefore to find that many of 
our later psycho-physicists have abandoned this view and 
1JIn the words of Dr. A. D. Waller, Brain, 1895, Fechner and Wundt 
subscribe to the view “that the transforming factor is psychological, i.e. 
between the sensificatory change and the sensation. Pfeffer, Delboeuf, and 
others hold that the disproportion is physiological, i.e. between the stimulus 
and the sensificatory change.”
-P-A-G-E-226
  212 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
agree that there is probably a discontinuity of increase of 
degree of nervous activity in connection with a mechani- 
cally continuous increase of stimulation, in correspondence 
with the discontinuous steps noted in our appreciation of 
increase of intensity. 
Sec. 15. In this connection it may be well to note that 
under the hypothesis hitherto maintained, it does not appear 
difficult to account for such a discontinuity of increasing 
neururgic increments, as the result of mechanically con- 
tinuously increasing degrees of stimulation. The activity of 
a neural element, if such could be isolated, would probably 
be found to increase in direct proportion to the increasing 
degree of its stimulation, and this increase of activity would 
continue until curtailed by exhaustion of the nerve element. 
The presentations in consciousness however, not being 
elemental but systemic, are supposed to correspond with the 
activities of complex minor nervous systems within the 
broader system in which differential functioning obtains, cer- 
tain parts of the system being given over to the regulation of 
the nutritive supply to the parts which are very important 
for our consideration. Under such conditions as obtain in 
the complex nervous system of men we should therefore 
expect to find increases of activity marked by irregular, or 
more or less rhythmical, pulses. For a minor nervous 
system which is acted upon by a stimulus which is con- 
tinuously increasing in degree cannot increase its d gree 
of activity without the breaking down of its substance: 
and this breaking down of its substance involv2s a 
lessening of its activity unless fresh nutriment is received 
to build it up again. Under a continuously increasing 
stimulation a corresponding reaction to this increase on the 
part of the organ stimulated can only occur as the result of 
the gain of an unusual supply of nourishment which the 
stimulated part calls for through its connection with the 
parts of the system specially related to the regulation of  
-P-A-G-E-227
  eee INTENSITY 213 
the blood supply. But some appreciable time must elapse 
between the reception of the stimulus by the part, and the 
effect upon the system which is to result in the gain of an 
increased supply of nourishment to the part stimulated ; 
and some appreciable time must be occupied in carrying the 
extra nutrition to the organ which calls for it. By the 
time the call for the extra nutrition is answered, the con- 
tinuously increasing stimulation may be supposed to be 
producing a reaction which is tending to wane. But when 
the extra supply is received the part will be in condition to 
react fully to the increased stimulus, and it would seem 
probable that it would do so with a bound, so to speak. 
At the same time the call from the active part for extra 
nutriment would cease ; and if the stimulation continued to 
increase in degree the stimulated part would presently again 
call for more nutriment, which would be sent forward, and 
which would again enable the part, whose capacity to fully 
react to the increased stimulus was waning, to react fully 
to the demand upon it: and here again the full reaction 
would come with more or less of a bound, if we may so 
speak. 
These more or less regular pulses of increased activity in 
the part would suffice, under this view, to produce neur- 
urgic increments which would result in more or less 
prominent changes in the form of the neururgic pattern 
existing at the moment. Correspondingly then on the 
conscious side we should expect to note that continuously 
increasing stimulation would give us the apprehension of 
increases of intensity in pulses as it were; and this is exactly 
what happens, as we have already seen. 
Sec. 16. It may be well before passing from this subject 
to make note in this connection of one bit of evidence 
corroborative of the general view maintained in this work. 
Where certain systems are thoroughly coordinated and are 
subject to regular or regularly recurring stimuli, rhythms of 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
nutritive supply might be expected in the process of develop- 
ment to come to correspond more or less exactly with rhythms 
of demand occasioned by stimulation. Although it is true 
that the more complex the system, the more will this cor- 
respondence be liable to disturbance ; yet on the other hand 
the more are we likely to have in such a very complex 
system a large mass of the system under usual conditions 
showing this correspondence between the demands occa- 
sioned by the stimulus and the rhythmic supply of nutriment. 
As a consequence we should expect to find that only in 
limited parts of the nervous system will it be possible to 
set up increased activities which will result in the produc- 
tion of neururgic increments which will produce marked 
changes in the neururgic pattern of the moment in question : 
and we should expect to find therefore, what we certainly do 
find, that only in limited parts of consciousness is it possible 
to gain such discernible presentations to the Self, as involve 
appreciable changes of intensity. 
Sec. 17. As we have seen, we can never allow ourselves 
to lose sight of the existence of the ever effective unempha- 
sized part of the psychic system—the Self—which when 
presentatively given appears as the empirical ego. We 
should expect therefore to note in cases of self-consciousness 
the empirical ego affecting the discernment of intensity. 
That such is the case cannot be questioned, but as it appears 
most clearly in the states which we describe as states of 
attention discussion of this subject will best be reserved 
for later consideration.

  SUB-DIVISION II. GENERAL QUALITIES INVOLVING THE 
RELATION OF MORE OR LESS, AND DETERMINED 
BY THE COMPLEXITY OF PRESENTATIONS 
CHAPTER IX 
MANIFOLDNESS 
Sec. 1. In Intensity we find a general quality of all 
presentations, and one involving the relation of more or less. 
We have reason to believe that what we call elemental 
intensity would be found to inhere in hypothetical psychic 
elements as such, were we able to isolate them; and that 
intensity as we appreciate it is transformed, as it were, 
since consciousness is systemic and not elemental. We 
naturally inquire therefore, whether there may not be other 
general qualities, of the same general type as intensity, which 
depend for their existence upon the fact that consciousness 
as we experience it is a system of minor systems of psychic 
elements. Here again we may hope to find guidance in our 
search by observation of the nature of the activities of the 
system of minor nervous systems of nervous elements which 
we assume to correspond with the psychic system we call 
consciousness. 
Sec. 2. If it is true that each element of the highly 
complex nervous system is more or less active while it has 
life ; and if, as is certainly the case, the system is subject to 
very diverse stimuli from its environment at each moment; 
then at each moment there must exist a multiplicity of
-P-A-G-E-230
216 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
emphases of activity of greater or less degree in the several 
parts of the whole system. At any one moment we are likely 
to find some of these emphases predominant ; but by the side 
of these there will be less dominant emphases; and even 
within the predominant emphases themselves will appear 
varied minor emphases. We may here again compare the 
activity of the nervous system at any moment to the surface 
of a liquid upon which various wave patterns are developed ; 
where we discover great billows upon which minor waves 
appear. 
Sec. 3. But if these complex emphases of activity in the 
parts of the nervous system correspond with the presenta- 
tions which are given in consciousness, then we should 
expect that at each moment our presentations would display 
a multiplicity determined by the greater or less degree of 
noetic emphasis in the several parts of the psychic system, 
i.e. of consciousness. At any moment we should be likely 
to find some of these psychic emphases predominant ; but 
given with these less dominant emphases, and within the 
predominant psychic emphases themselves, minor emphases. 
In other words, while we should expect to discover special 
presentations which seem to be pre-eminent, nevertheless a 
careful observation should show us, given with these, certain 
minor presentations less notable but still differentiable ; and 
even within the pre-eminent presentations themselves we 
should expect to note certain of these minor presentations. 
We should therefore expect to find consciousness as 
observable always displaying a general characteristic, or 
quality, which is determined by the varying number of these 
minor and major partial presentations, a quality which must 
therefore always involve the relation of more or less. It 
seems clear that we find such a general psychic characteristic 
or quality in what 'I shall call Manifoldness: more or less of 
this manifoldness being observable as inherent in all of our 
presentations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
MANIFOLDNESS 217 
Sec. 4. All will acknowledge that those presentations 
which we designate as thoughts or conceptions are very 
clearly complex, i.e. they display an easily recognized 
measure of manifoldness. No one would claim that the 
thought of what I am writing, or of what the reader will 
peruse on these pages, is other than a manifold. You 
cannot reflect upon any concept, say the “ theory of develop- 
ment,” without recognizing at once that it is a presentation 
in which manifoldness is very marked. And it is clear also 
that within this field of thought this manifoldness varies in 
degree. The student’s notion of Psychology becomes more 
and more complex as he continues his early studies: but 
presently the notion loses in manifoldness as he discovers 
fundamental laws which are traceable throughout the intricate 
details which his first studies brought to light ; the recogni- 
tion of these laws involves the prominence within the given 
presentations of broader emphases, less numerous but more 
marked than the less marked and more numerous emphases 
which were at first prominent. 
So it is of percepts. When I think of the friend who 
steps into my study as I write and speaks to me, the pre- 
sentation referred to by my simple words of description is 
clearly most complex or manifold. And our percepts also 
very evidently differ in their manifoldness, as becomes clear 
when, with this quality in mind, we compare such a relatively 
simple percept as “the hound” with such a relatively 
complex percept as the ever shifting and broadly diffused 
gleam of the aurora borealis. 
Our emotions very obviously display much of manifold- 
ness; which also varies in degree. Love seems pervasive 
and broad in comparison with fear: yet fear itself is clearly 
most complex. And what we call fear itself varies in 
manifoldness; as is seen if we compare the fear that, if 
speaking with care, we would call indefinite dread, with the 
much more clear and distinct and definite fear which arises
-P-A-G-E-232
218 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
  when for instance we discover a dangerous animal rushing 
upon us. 
Sec. 5. But when we turn to our sensations the case is 
not so clear. So simple indeed do our most marked sensa- 
tions appear that, as we know, sensations in general have 
been treated by many of the earlier psychologists as psychic 
atoms, as it were, from which by composition other more 
complex mental states may be derived. Evidently such a 
theory could scarcely be maintained except by one who 
denied, or overlooked, the existence of the general quality 
of manifoldness in the simplest of our sensations. 
That certain of our sensations, e.g. those of temperature, 
and smell, and taste, and touch, are diffused and display 
much of manifoldness, is not in doubt: but until very late 
times it has not been realized that all of our sensations—e.g. 
those of sight and hearing—display this manifoldness. 
Indeed, as the reader well knows, it is one of the important 
modern observations that even our clearest cut sensations are 
always more or less complex ; a fact that has been brought 
out sharply in connection with modern investigations of 
space-perception. 
The study of the nature of the quality which results in 
our attachment of spatial attributes to certain presentations 
has led some of our leading psychologists to observe a certain 
massiveness (Bain), which is distinctly a spatial quality, and 
which appears in connection with certain of our sensations, 
e.g. heat, smell, taste, touch, etc. Having been led to look 
for this same quality in the sensations of sight and hearing, 
certain psychologists claim to have discovered it in what 
they call “extensity,” a term suggested by the pioneer 
investigator in this direction, Dr. James Ward. Ward has 
been followed by James and Stumpf and many others in 
upholding this view, so that one who questions its accuracy 
as I have done above! must do so with much diffidence: but 
1 Confer Appendix A, Secs. 21 ff.
-P-A-G-E-233
  MANIFOLDNESS 219 
we may note that it is not clear that Dr. Ward and Dr. 
James, and others who follow them, have not in their 
introspection confused what we here call the manifoldness of 
these sensational experiences with the extensity for which 
they are in search ; and it is not difficult to see that there is 
a marked difference between the two qualities. At all events 
the investigations made by these keen thinkers have certainly 
shown us conclusively that even the simplest of our sensa- 
tional experiences are never really absolutely simple, but 
always display a certain degree of manifoldness, as we should 
be led to expect would be the case. 
Sec. 6. We find then in Manifoldness another general 
quality of all presentations which involves the relation of 
more or less, and which may therefore be placed in Group 1. 
together with Intensity which we have considered in the 
previous chapter. 
It is to be noted here in relation to manifoldness, as was 
noted in relation to intensity, that the greater or less mani- 
foldness of a presentation must always be experienced ; but 
that it is not necessarily always specifically recognized. 
When manifoldness is recognized as such it is appreciated 
in reflection in itself as a presentation of a specific form. 
The manifoldness of any given presentation is appreciated 
as more or less by comparison with the degrees of mani- 
foldness of other special presentations as given in the 
form of secondary presentations or ‘“‘images”’ in reflection ; 
or else with the manifoldness of the field of attention as 
a whole. The recognition of the manifoldness involves 
the appearance of a special wave form in our symbolic 
noetic pattern ;—it involves a special “sense of relation” 
which is as definite a presentation as is any other of those 
senses of relation of which we have elsewhere spoken at 
length. When we appreciate a degree of manifoldness it 
is because this special ‘‘sense of relation” is given at the 
moment.
-P-A-G-E-234
  220 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
Sec. 7. The degree of manifoldness of a given presenta- 
tion is a relative matter, determined by the greater or less 
number of partial minor emphases within the whole major 
emphasis which we designate in a broad way as the pre- 
sentation of the moment. Evidently the degree of emphasis 
in these minor parts of the manifold must vary, and must 
fade away, if we may so speak, into the undifferentiable 
psychic mass of those parts of consciousness against which 
the presentations stand out in contrast; even as the countless 
waves of an agitated liquid surface shade off from great 
billows into lesser waves, and these into less marked wave- 
lets, and these again into the undifferentiable perturbations 
of the great surface which give us the appearance of a mass 
against which the just observable wavelets, and the more 
marked waves, and the greater billows, stand contrasted. 
Sec. 8. It is clear that the realm in which the quality of 
manifoldness is most marked in introspection is that diffused 
part of the field of attention which is most closely allied 
with the undifferentiable mass of the psychic system to 
which the presentations are given. It would appear then 
that the very excessive manifoldness within the unemphasized 
psychic mass beyond the limits of the field of attention is 
coordinate with its existence as an undifferentiable mass, to 
which the less manifold presentations are given. But this 
undifferentiable psychic mass is under our hypothesis the 
Self to which presentations are given ; out of this realm in 
which manifoldness is pre-eminent therefore we must expect 
to find arising the influences which are attributed to the Self, 
and which when explicit are attributed to that presentation 
of special form, which is a simulacrum of the Self, and which 
we designate as the empirical ego. The undifferentiable 
unemphasized part of the psychic system thus, so far as it 
acts to make manifoldness prominent, tends to bring into 
existence as a presentation the empirical ego of self-con- 
sciousness.  
-P-A-G-E-235
  
  CHAPTER X 
REALNESS 
I 
Sec. 1. In the preceding chapters we have considered two 
general qualities of presentations which involve the relation 
of more or less :. a certain degree of Intensity, and a certain 
degree of Manifoldness, we have found must attach to each 
presentation, whether their presence is appreciated or not. 
Of these we have noted that Intensity is a quality which 
would attach to a psychic element if such could be isolated, 
and that this elemental intensity is known to us only as it is 
transformed in connection with our experience of presenta- 
tions which are not elemental but are complex systems of 
minor psychic systems. Manifoldness on the other hand 
we have found to be a general quality which could not be 
given in connection with a psychic element, even if such 
an element could be isolated ; but which is determined by 
the fact that our presentations are thus complex systems of 
minor psychic systems. 
‘When we take another point of view we recall, as we 
have seen in Chapter v., that apparently each primary per- 
ceptual presentation is accompanied by an overwhelmed 
secondary presentation, which latter develops when the 
primary presentation ceases to exist.! Thus in any moment 
1 The reader will recall our symbolization in Chapter v. of the simplest 
possible primary presentation as follows : 
oer B ° a ° yr-2.3°4 a Bi 73,4353, pi 2-3 4  
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
the form of the presentative field must be determined in 
part by the resultants of the development of secondary 
presentations given in past states. Thus within given pre- 
sentations certain minor emphases may appear which are 
revivals of antecedent successive presentations which were 
more or less alike. These revivals then may well appear 
at times to be what we call identical with each other, and 
they will therefore seem to persist more or less fully while 
the major presentations in the body of which they are 
incorporated seem to change. 
We should therefore expect to find evidence of the exist- 
ence of a general quality of all presentations given by the 
appreciation of this greater or less persistence or stability 
of minor emphases within these primary and secondary 
presentations within the wholes of the complex presenta- 
tions. This quality would be one which would naturally 
be grouped with Intensity and Manifoldness as a quality 
involving the relation of more or less. 
II 
Sec. 2. Let us suppose ourselves standing on a bluff 
overlooking a lake, and watching its wave-broken surface. 
(1) If we choose to pay attention to any little wavelet, we 
note that it moves over the surface apparently quite without 
reference to the other disturbances of the sea, and with a 
stability all its own ; running on, now over the crest of 
some great billow, and now deep in the trough between two. 
Whatever pattern prevails at the moment on the surface of 
the sea as a whole, the little wave plays on for a while 
whether it is important or not: but we note that we must 
keep close watch of it or it will soon be lost to view ; it 
tends to disappear within, as it were, the larger waves and 
billows which persist. 
(2) If we pay attention to the surface of the lake as such, 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  
REALNESS 223 
and consider the pattern upon its surface as a whole, this 
pattern is apparently not disturbed by the little wave at first 
considered ; and although we know that the form of the 
pattern is in some measure modified by the little wave, still, 
from our present point of view, the main surface pattern 
appears relatively stable, and the little wave form relatively 
unstable. 
(3) It is true, as we have just said, that each little wavelet 
has its influence in giving form to the main pattern of the 
moment observed: in the next moment the little wave may 
have less of stability in itself because of inhibitive influences 
arising out of the existing broader pattern; but on the 
other hand its stability in this next moment may be increased 
because of other influences arising from within the existing 
pattern which sustain and support it. 
Let us now suppose that the lake surface is undisturbed 
by any but very small ripples due to a gentle breeze. A 
pattern is developed on the surface, but it is one of no very 
emphatic form. But if (4) I throw a huge stone into the 
little pond, at once the indistinct wave pattern on the surface 
is lost to view, and the big wave formed by the large stone 
determines a new and relatively stable form of wave pattern. 
(5) But suppose instead of throwing in the huge stone I 
throw in at intervals little pebbles at the same point on the 
surface. If I throw them in at exactly the moments of wave 
depression the little waves formed will reinforce those already 
existing, and will add stability to the pattern of the moment. 
If however I throw them in at the wrong moments, the 
existing wave pattern will be disturbed, rendered less stable. 
Sec. 3. We have seen in previous chapters that we may 
use wave surface conditions as symbols of the nature of the 
activities of the nervous system of man. The neururgic 
pattern of any moment is a most complex one due to the 
many emphases of activities induced by various environ- 
mental forces which are at the moment, or have been in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
    224 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
past, impressed upon the nervous system. If the form of 
the patterns in successive moments is considered, we will 
note, in correspondence with what we have said in the 
previous section : 
1st. That each of these emphases of neural cotas will 
have a stability all its own. When we speak of this stability 
we of course do not mean to indicate that in two successive 
moments there is an identity of form; but rather, as we 
have already seen, that there is basis for that comparison in 
future moments which leads us to say that the form of 
moment r is “‘ very like” the form of moment 2. 2nd. In 
the second place it is to be noted that each neururgic 
emphasis must have more or less of stability in relation to 
the pre-eminent neururgic pattern existing at the time of 
the appearance of this emphasis: even as the little wave 
appears in a different light if we are viewing the wave surface 
pattern as a whole. And 3rd, the grade of stability of each 
neururgic emphasis will vary as it bears relation with various 
types of neururgic patterns which may be pre-eminent at 
the time of its appearance ; even as we have seen that the 
little wave on the liquid surface may in successive moments 
have less or more of stability according as it is inhibited, 
or supported, by the existing pre-eminent wave pattern. 
4th. It appears also that very powerful or persistent 
stimuli may result in neururgic emphases which will compel 
the formation of a new pre-eminent neururgic pattern which 
will be relatively stable ; even as the throwing of a huge 
stone into the still pool will determine the formation of a 
new and relatively stable wave surface pattern. 5th. But 
evidently, ix general, the grade of stability of a special 
neururgic emphasis will be determined by its capacity to 
combine with, or not to combine with, the neururgic pattern 
existing at the moment of the appearance of this emphasis. 
Between the cases where there is little relation between the 
new emphasis and the pre-eminent neururgic pattern of the   
-P-A-G-E-239
    
REALNESS 225 
moment, and the cases where there is the closest conceivable 
relation between the two, there will be all grades of possible 
relation ; so that the new emphasis may under different 
conditions display all grades from the most extreme of 
instability to the most perfect stability. Thus each 
neururgic emphasis must display more or less of stability 
(varying from extreme stability to extreme instability) in 
relation to the development of the whole neururgic pattern 
of the moment in which it appears. 
Finally it is to be noted that a new emphasis may 
harmonize or assimilate with emphases within minor systems 
which are not pre-eminent in giving the form of the 
neururgic pattern of the moment ; but which may thereupon 
become pre-eminent in the determination of this form. And 
it is clear that this assimilation may be due to the existence 
within the wide mass of the nervous system of capacities to 
form neururgic patterns harmonious with this new emphasis ; 
—capacities which before the occurrence of the new neururgic 
emphasis are potential merely and not clearly related to the 
emphases pre-eminent in giving form to the previously 
existing neururgic pattern. The importance of this point 
will appear later. 
Il 
Sec. 4. Inasmuch as the neururgic emphases above 
spoken of are correspondent with those noetic emphases 
which we speak of as presentations, we should expect to find, 
in connection with our presentations, conditions of relative 
stability corresponding with those above described as con- 
nected with neururgic emphases. Furthermore this more 
or less of stability must itself affect the nature of the 
presentation in which it appears, and: it must itself involve 
the existence, within the whole complex mental state, of a 
special minor emphasis or presentation, a special ‘‘ sense of 
relation,’ which under favorable conditions may be con- 
2
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
sidered in and for itself. We may expect therefore to find 
that we apprehend the existence of a general quality of all 
presentations due to this relative stability of certain minor 
parts of complex presentations, which quality will therefore 
be found to involve the relation of more or less. 
It is to be noted that the assertion that this stability exists 
does not stand in opposition to the view that each pre- 
sentation is a perfectly new experience. All that is implied 
is that we experience complex presentations of triple em- 
phasis which involve the comparison of, and declared 
likeness between, what we call successive experiences. This 
so-called identification of successive states is indeed the basis 
of this notion of stability. 
The question then arises whether this general quality is 
recognizable, and if so by what name it is to be designated. 
It must in a sense attach to each moment’s presentation in 
the very fact that this presentation exists as such, whether it 
is, or is not, assimilated so as to affect appreciably the con- 
sciousness of future moments. If it is recognizable in 
reflection, then each specific presentation, as it stands in 
relation with the whole field of presentations of the moment, 
must always display more or less of it; and the emphasis of 
this quality as attaching to a given presentation as viewed in 
reflection must vary with the nature of the whole psychic 
field at the moment under consideration. A given pre- 
sentation may have a high degree of this quality in relation 
to one moment’s noetic pattern, and yet may have a very 
low degree of this quality in relation to that of another 
moment ; and this without involving any difference in the 
initial presentation itself in the two supposed cases: this 
quality therefore must be a quality of relation. 
No one who is familiar with the trend of modern psycho- 
logical teaching, especially as it has been elucidated by 
Professor William James, can fail to recognize that the 
general quality we have been here describing is the quality 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
REALNESS 227 
which is usually considered under some such descriptive 
term as the “‘ sense of reality”: but which I shall speak of 
as Realness ; a quality which varies in degree from a maxi- 
mum to a minimum, to which latter we are wont to give 
the name Unrealness. 
It is to be noted here that much difficulty is caused in 
the study of this subject by the use of the word “‘ reality ” 
with diverse connotations.’ Reality, as I shall employ the 
term, is a concept of a special form of which I shall speak 
more at length below. But unfortunately this word is alsa 
used very carelessly, by laymen and psychologists alike, to 
refer also to this general quality of all presentations which I 
call realness :? this leading to many confusions of thought 
and speech. 
1Prof. J. Mark Baldwin uses the term “reality feeling” (Feeling and 
Will, chap. vii.) in contradistinction from Belief. The reader will note 
later that I distinguish the realness of a presentation from that appreciation 
of enforced realness which arises with belief. 
2Thus Prof. James (Psychohgy, ii. p. 283) tells us that “in the case 
of acquiescence or belief the object . . . is held to have reality.” If 
this is correct usage then the words “believed by the complete philo- 
sopher” are equivalent to “held by the complete philosopher to have 
reality.” Where then we read (p. 291) “the world of absolute reality, 
ie. reality believed by the complete philosopher” we might read “reality 
held by the complete philosopher to have reality” which is evidently 
meaningless unless the word reality is used in the one case to refer to 
the concept and in the other to the quality which I would call realness. 
8 As one instance, where many might be given, we may take a statement 
made by Mr. F. H. Bradley in his Appearance and Reality, the subject 
matter of which surely called for the most careful definition and use of 
the terms here under consideration. On page 225 of the work referred 
to Mr. Bradley says: “It is mere thoughtlessness that finds in Resistance 
the one manifestation of reality. For resistance, in the first place, is full 
of unsolved contradictions, and is also fixed and consists in that very 
character. And in the second place, what experience can come as more 
actual than sensuous pain or pleasure.” 
Very evidently Mr. Bradley, when he wrote the above lines, meant to 
convey the impression that the actuality of sensuous pain refers to the same
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
It is to be noted also in relation to realness, as we have 
noted in relation to intensity and manifoldness, that while 
the greater or less of stability or realness in connection with 
a given presentation must always be experienced, neverthe- 
less it is not always necessarily appreciated as such. When 
the realness of a presentation is recognized as such, it is 
appreciated in reflection in itself as a presentation of a 
specific form ; its recognition involves the prominence of 
a special ‘‘ sense of relation” which is as definite a pre- 
sentation in reflection as is any other of the “‘senses of 
relation” of which we have already spoken. It is appreci- 
ated when by holding a complex retrospective presentation 
before us we note the nature of some given minor emphasis 
in the successive noetic patterns covered by this retrospect. 
The realness of the given partial presentation within this 
complex is appreciated as more or less by comparison with 
the degrees of realness of other special partial presentations, 
or with the degree of realness given in the field of attention 
as a whole as this field is considered in reflection. 
If the recognition of realness is thus determined, it is 
evident that the fullest grade of realness in connection with 
a given presentation, a grade which is undisturbed even as 
is necessary in the operation of comparison, will tend to fail 
of recognition ; and this we find to be the case. Just as 
an intensity which is fully coordinated with the varied in- 
tensities of the system as a whole fails to be noted: so also 
we fail to note fully established grades of realness ; we take 
both for granted ; the realness and the intensity senses of 
relation fail to appear as noticeable presentations. It is thus 
characteristic as the rea/ity mentioned in the first sentence quoted : and this 
I imagine because in current language, the words “can have more reality” 
might be substituted for the words “can come as more actual.” But clearly 
in this latter case he refers to what I call the realness of the pain, and 
not to reality, properly speaking, at all. If then he refers in his first 
sentence to reality, properly speaking, his reference in the last sentence 
to the actuality of sensuous pain is entirely without significance,
-P-A-G-E-243
  REALNESS 229 
for instance that the common man fails altogether to 
appreciate the fact that he trusts to the realness of objects in 
the outer world unless question is raised in regard to this 
realness: then to be sure he has no hesitancy in asserting 
this realness, and will even probably consider the question 
itself ridiculous; but apart from the questioning the 
appreciation of this realness is lacking. 
IV 
Sec. 5. Let us consider this matter a little more fully, 
referring back by number to the points made in relation to 
the neururgic correspondents in the previous divisions of 
this chapter. 
(1) If realness is such a general quality of presentations 
as we above suggest, then we are prepared to note that 
each presentation, as such, has a certain form of realness in the 
fact that it exists. In other words, if I have a sensational 
presentation it is a real sensation. If I have an emotional 
presentation it is without doubt a real emotion. If 
thoughts, concepts, or percepts are given, they are real 
thoughts, real concepts, real percepts. This the reader may 
say is a mere platitude ; but that it is a fact well worthy of 
consideration appears clear when we consider that we often 
describe these very presentations as unreal. How do I 
happen to say that this conception of the earth as a flat 
surface is unreal?—that this ghostly percept is unreal? 
Considered as presentations the concept is surely a real con- 
cept and the percept is as surely a real percept. This 
observation at once compels us to agree that this quality of 
realness is a quality of relation ; that in one aspect a pre- 
sentation may have much of realness, while in another aspect 
it may have very little of realness. It shows us that realness 
is no such certain, and fixed quality as it is likely to be 
considered by the common man, who usually thinks that
-P-A-G-E-244
  230 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
presentations must be either real or not real, and that there 
is no middle ground except in his own failure of dis- 
crimination,—no sense in which a presentation may be both 
real and unreal at the same time from different points of 
view. But such is surely the case, and to the consideration 
of this aspect of realness we turn in making our second 
point. 
Sec. 6. (2) Each special presentation must have more or 
less of realness in reference to the total noetic pattern existing 
at the moment of its appearance. 
If during a cold snap in winter you say “‘ there is ice on 
the Park lakes ; get your skates and come off with me for 
some exercise” ; there is an immediate sense of realness in 
connection with the presentation ‘‘ the ice is formed on the 
lakes.” But the case would be quite different had you made 
the remark in midsummer. I would then either think you 
had gone mad with the heat, or else were chaffing me. 
It is to be noted that these differences of realness do not 
have to be considered and thought out; whether their 
existence as such is appreciated or not, they are immediately 
experienced as presentations exactly as all other “‘ senses of 
relation” are. It is true of course that we do at times 
hesitate to accept the realness of certain presentations ; but 
this is because they actually gain in one moment a realness 
which they lose in another moment, as they are related to 
diverse noetic patterns in the several moments in which they 
appear. And this brings us to our next point. 
Sec. 7. (3) The realness of amy special presentation will 
vary according as it bears relation to one or another of various 
types of noetic patterns which may be pre-eminent at the time 
of its appearance. 
Although we recognize that each presentation as such is real 
per se, so far as it occupies practically the whole of the moment’s 
presentative field ; nevertheless, we also recognize that when, 
as considered in reflection, it does not thus occupy the whole
-P-A-G-E-245
  
REALNESS 231 
of this field, it must be more or less real as it stands in 
relation to other parts of, or to the whole of, the field of the 
moment ; and that the degree of its realness as viewed in 
reflection must vary with the nature of the field of presenta- 
tion at the moment under consideration. In other words, a 
given presentation may be very real in relation to one 
moment’s “‘ noetic pattern,” while it may have a very low 
degree of realness in relation to the “‘ noetic pattern” of 
another moment, and this without there being any practical 
difference in the initial presentation itself in the two cases. 
Sec. 8. We thus find our attention turned to the im- 
portant fact that there are diverse realms of realness,’ and 
that these realms are divided into smaller kingdoms, and 
still smaller dependencies. The realm of realness in which 
we dwell when we assume the réle of the introspective 
psychologist is quite diverse from the realm in which we 
abide when we are concerned with every day objects in the 
outer world. Introspectively we say this “‘ ghost” is real 
as an impression or thought ; but in the objective world 
realm it appears as markedly unreal. And among these 
objects in the outer world again there is the greatest differ- 
ence ; say between the realm of realness to which light and 
shade considerations belong in which shadows appear of great 
importance, and the realm of realness in which ice forms, and 
water evaporates, and living men move and breathe. And 
among these objects the minor realm of realness in which 
living men exist is itself diverse from the minor realm of the 
chemist in which H,O assumes its diverse forms. 
In this connection I would ask the reader to note that, as 
presentations which exist in diverse realms of realness are 
diverse in the fact that they assimilate with diverse noetic 
patterns ; so evidently it is impossible to leap from one 
1Dr. James would describe these as diverse “orders of reality.” Cf. 
Psychology, ii. pp. 287 to 298. Also F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, 
pp. 187, 188 and 370.  
-P-A-G-E-246
    232 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
realm of realness to another in practical life without risk of 
disastrous consequences. If we are following a guide on a 
difficult trail along the brink of a precipice we must keep 
our thought in the living-man realm of realness, and must 
not attempt to guide our footsteps by reference to the move- 
ments of our guide’s shadow. 
In our every day life it is all too easy to step thus from 
one realm of realness to another, and we do this often by 
the use of words and phrases which are employed alike to 
refer to our presentations in such diverse realms. But the 
reader will at once agree that in so doing we are likely to 
become involved in verbal fallacies. The same words and 
phrases have different connotations as they assimilate with 
different noetic patterns, i.e. when they are within diverse 
realms of realness. We cannot therefore properly argue 
from premises in one realm of realness to conclusions in 
diverse realms. 
The order of realness in which we dwell when we are 
considering objects in the outer world is quite diverse from 
the order of realness in which we dwell when we are thinking 
of those of our mental states which are not objects in the 
outer world, e.g. our pleasures and pains. As practical men 
dealing with the realness or unrealness of objects in the 
outer world we are not warranted in applying our standards 
of realness as related to objects in the outer world to the 
realm of shadows, and much less to the realm of our own 
so-called introspective states. Shadows as such, and our 
pleasures and pains as such, have a realness all their own: 
but these realms of realness are not the realms of realness 
of practical life. 
In this connection we may emphasize the impropriety of 
passing carelessly from the realm of realness in which are 
included objects in the outer world, to the realm of realness 
in which exist those metaphysical conceptions which lead to 
the question as to the place of evil and pain in a world of
-P-A-G-E-247
  REALNESS 233 
the Absolute ; for the main objection to the attitude of mind 
of the ‘‘ Christian Scientist ” and others of his ilk, lies just 
here. Healthy and diseased bodily conditions are objects 
in the outer world. Our metaphysical theories of the 
universe are in a diverse realm of realness. In the latter 
realm it may be argued with much force, as it is by a certain 
school of philosophers, that men’s bodily diseases, and their 
pains, are intrinsically unreal if the Universe is to be viewed 
from the standpoint of the Absolutist. This notion, imper- 
fectly understood, the Christian Scientist has taken to 
himself. But he is here thinking in a realm of realness 
quite diverse from that of the realm of practical life in which 
we deal with objects in the outer world. He jumps from 
premises made in one realm to conclusions made in the other 
realm. In the philosophical field of realness, as he under- 
stands it, he says disease and man’s bodily pains are unreal 
forms of thought, and he jumps to the diverse realm of 
practical life and tells us we must not employ doctors. 
We have here the basis of the most ordinary of delusions 
and illusions. It is not that these are unreal in themselves 
as experiences ; for surely nothing is more real to the insane 
than these very delusions and illusions. The difficulty with 
the afflicted man lies for the most part in the fact that he 
misplaces his presentations, and makes them part and parcel 
of realms of realness from which the normal man excludes 
them unhesitatingly. 
Sec. 9. (4) A very emphatic, or very persistent presentation 
may gain a large measure: of realness, irrespective of the form 
of the noetic pattern existing at the moment of its appearance. 
Any very marked sensation, or any very emphatic thought, 
say the presentation which arises if we hear the cry of 
murder, involves a large measure of realness due to the 
very strength of emphasis of the presentation itself. 
A presentation which lacks realness may be given this 
quality by mere increase of emphasis. A low rumble in
-P-A-G-E-248
    234 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
the air may be heard and listened to, but may result in no 
realization of an approaching storm, even if our companion 
says ‘‘ we are going to have a thunder shower.” But a 
loud clap of thunder at once brings us to our feet to run 
to shelter from a real storm. The mere change in intensity 
has given realness to the thunder storm presentation. 
Again, all very persistent sensations, even if not very 
emphatic (say the slight lumbago from which I am suffering 
as I write), all very persistent thoughts (say the “‘ ideés 
fixes” of the insane) involve a large measure of realness of 
the presentation. A presentation which lacks realness may 
be given this quality by persistent repetition. The first 
suggestion that Johnson is dishonest makes no impression 
upon me: but the mere fact that ten people, all of whom 
have read the same newspaper, tell me the same story of his 
alleged dishonorable conduct, puts me as much on my guard 
against him as though he were a proven thief. All those 
who study the rise of illusions in the insane know well how 
mere repetition of an idea will give it sufficient realness to 
make it an important element in the conscious life of the 
patient. 
Sec. to. From one point of view ‘‘ objects in the outer 
world” are, as we have seen, complex systematized concepts 
which when examined are found to connote a realness which 
appears to involve an existence quite independent of mental 
states as exclusive of them, and therefore quite independent 
of our recognition of their existence. This very marked 
and distinct realness is determined by the forcefulness of, 
and the repetition of, what we call identical sensational and 
kindred elements involved with the perception of these 
outer-world objects ; which forcefulness and repetition neces- 
sarily produce a relative stability of a high order in the 
presentations involved. So marked is this characteristic of 
our percepts that psychologists since Hume have even been 
led to hold that the very essence of the realness of all pre-
-P-A-G-E-249
    REALNESS 235 
sentations is due to their revived connection with sensational 
experiences ; and even so advanced a thinker as Prof. James, 
although he does not hesitate to state that ‘‘ any relation to 
our mind at all, in the absence of a stronger appeal, suffices 
to make an object” (I should say presentation) “‘ real,” never- 
theless still clings to the view that’ “sensible objects 
are thus either our realities or the tests of our realities. 
Conceived objects must show sensible effects or else be 
disbelieved.” 
This surely is going much too far. I am quite willing 
to agree that Prof. James is not far wrong in holding that 
“sensible vividness and pungency is the vital factor in reality 
when once the conflict between objects, and the connection 
of them together in the mind, has begun” ; although I 
should be inclined to say “a vital factor,” instead of “ the 
vital factor.” On the other hand, it seems to me that he 
gives an impression of over-emphasizing the importance of 
sensational realness, and in a manner which is surely incom- 
patible not only with the facts of experience, but also with 
his own theory. If I understand him, he would not disagree 
with the thesis here maintained, viz. that the quality of 
1 Psychology, ii. p. 299. Prof. James’ use of the word reality here leads 
to some doubt as to the exact meaning he wishes to convey. Confer 
op. cit, p. 301. For a fuller discussion of this subject see Chapter xxv. 
of this work, Sec. 14 ff. It is to be noted in this connection that this 
distinction was instinctively grasped by the Greeks in the development 
of their language which so fully expressed delicate differences implicit in 
their mental life: for as Prof. B, L. Gildersleeve has said “to the Greek 
the world was first ‘Wille’; then ‘Vorstellung.’ The consciousness of 
the not-me comes from the putting forth of will. The first object is the 
object created, the object effected, under which all other olyects may be subsumed.” 
This, I take it, means that the words earliest used by the Greeks in all 
reference to objects were those which as the language developed were 
especially employed in connection with conscious self-determination. 
I quote above from a private letter which Prof. Gildersleeve has allowed 
me to use. Confer his 4 Syntactician among the Psychologists. Journal of 
Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, vol. ii. 4.  
-P-A-G-E-250
  236 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
realness is a general quality which in some measure must 
attach to each and every presentation: and if this be true, 
and if it be also true, as we have held, that there is no ground 
for the notion that all of our conscious experience is a deriva- 
tive of sensational experience (see Book 1. Ch. v.) then it 
is impossible to hold that realness must be traced back to 
the recall of sensational experience. 
Such views as we have above considered would never, in 
my opinion, have been maintained but for the atomistic 
preconception that our sensations are the stuff out of which 
our percepts and ideas are constructed, as it were. For as 
a matter of fact, what we observe is that while our sensations 
have a very marked measure of realness, for the reasons 
stated in the first paragraph of this section: nevertheless 
that our percepts, and the concepts which relate to objects 
in the outer world, display in a certain sense a still larger 
measure of realness, they maintaining their spatial stability 
often notwithstanding the observable instability of the sen- 
sations by which they are initiated. 
That sensible vividness is not essential to realness is 
indeed upheld by reference to every day experience. When, 
for instance, we consider such a concept as that of the Deity 
we note certain relations in which it has a large measure of 
realness which it is very difficult to suppose can be traced 
back to sensational realness. A like ‘‘ sense of realness ” 
occurs also where common characteristics run through a vast 
series of experiences ; as, for instance, when we appreciate 
the realness of the notion of causality. 
As a matter of fact the form of realness connected with 
our sensation-perceptual presentations is of relatively little 
moment in the realm of reflection. It is usually passed over 
in every day life without being apprehended ; it comes into 
prominence only where question is raised in connection with 
it, that is when we doubt ; and then the noetic emphasis 
referred to is for the most part within the conceptual realm 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
  REALNESS 237 
developed in retrospect. This means that the apprehension 
of realness is usually bound up, not with our sensational 
experiences at all, nor with our perceptual experiences as 
directly given, but with these latter as considered ideally, 
and with other emphases of the ideal order. 
Thus while on the one hand our most vivid apprehensions 
of realness are given in the consideration of our perceptual 
experiences, on the other hand our most important and varied 
apprehensions of realness are given in connection with the 
existence of emphases within purely conceptual psychic areas. 
Sec. 11. (5) In general the degree of realness of any special 
presentation is determined by its capacity, or lack of capacity, 
to assimilate with the noetic pattern that exists at the moment 
of its appearance. 
Beyond the quality of momentary stability connected 
indissolubly with the fact that it exists at all, each presenta- 
tion has more or less of what we may call potential stability, 
which is dependent upon its capacity to harmonize with, to 
be assimilated by, the noetic pattern of the moment of its 
appearance. The noetic pattern of the moment may, for 
instance, relate to the conditions now existing on the surface 
of the earth, and the added presentation may refer to a 
condition in which all water would have disappeared, being 
replaced by vapor: this last presentation will then have an 
instability, an unrealness, in relation to the main field which 
is occupied with conceptions relating to existing terrestrial 
conditions. If, on the other hand, the noetic pattern of the 
moment happens to relate to the condition of the earth long 
ages ago, then the newly given notion of the disappearance 
of all water on the earth in the form of aqueous vapor may 
well have stability, may well appear as real. 
A presentation may arise, and then apparently immediately 
disappear ; and this because it bears but slight relation to 
either the moment’s field of definite presentations, or to 
the broad field of inattention. Its realness will thus be
-P-A-G-E-252
  238 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
ephemeral. The man engaged in deep thought may be 
affected by some unusual sound to which he could attach 
no meaning even were he to listen carefully to it: for the 
moment it may appear as a presentation in, consciousness, 
but only to disappear in the immediately succeeding moment. 
Or the presentation may gain a greater degree of realness 
in the fact that although it is unrelated to the emphatic parts 
of the noetic pattern of the moment, yet it is related to some 
minor undifferentiable parts of the field of inattention which 
are prepared to develop a marked noetic pattern. Thus the 
man engaged in thought may be disturbed momentarily by 
a knock on the door of his study. This sound bears no 
relation to his current of thought, and it fails of stability, 
or realness, so far as that field of thought is concerned. But 
if the knocking on the door might have the meaning “ some 
visitor awaits you” ; if in other words it had relations with 
a possible and not unusual noetic pattern ; and if a visitor 
in whom the student takes an interest had been expected ; 
the student might not improbably have found his course of 
thought disturbed by a new thought series connected with 
the expected visit, although he might be entirely unable to 
recall the hearing of the knock, and might wonder at the 
disturbance of his thought. In that case the new presenta- 
tion would have a measure of realness due to the readiness 
of the system to develop a new noetic pattern. 
If what we have just said is true other experiences should 
be noted in which this realness obtains without any recog- 
nizable relation to the main presentative field whatever, but 
in connection with some influence which evidently arises 
within the field of inattention, within the Self. Of this 
origin of realness we shall find it necessary to speak in 
Chapter xv.; and in order to avoid repetition we shall 
therefore defer discussion of this very important point.  
-P-A-G-E-253
  REALNESS 239 
Vv 
Sec. 12. We thus appear to have found in Realness a 
third general quality of all presentations which involves the 
relation of more or less ; a quality which may therefore be 
grouped with Intensity and Manifoldness considered in the 
previous chapters. Intensity is a quality due to elemental 
psychic characteristics. Manifoldness is a quality determined 
by the systematization of psychic elements. Realness is a 
quality determined by the relation of similar presentations 
within successive noetic patterns. As elemental intensity 
as transformed, and as manifoldness, are both given in some 
measure in connection with all presentations as viewed in 
reflection ; so some measure of realness must appear in con- 
nection with each presentation, inasmuch as each presentation 
as viewed in reflection necessarily involves the revivals of, 
or secondary presentations related to, primary presentations 
that are past and gone. 
Sec. 13. As we have already seen, realness is a quality 
involving relativity. Our sensations are usually determined 
by stimuli which are often powerful, and which are always 
more or less recurrent: and as a result we note that our 
sensations do not often seem unreal, for as we have seen 
above these conditions of forcefulness and persistence neces- 
sarily involve a high degree of realness. Nevertheless we 
are all ready to agree that some sensations are more real than 
others: the sensations due to the cutting of the skin, for 
instance, are much more real for us than the ordinary sen- 
sations of light or sound which usually pass unnoticed in 
comparison with the perceptive and thought trains which 
develop from, or in connection with, them. 
Percepts which we experience when we observe “‘ objects 
in an outer world” are notably real. But here again we 
easily see that even the common man accepts the relativity 
of the quality of realness in connection with them. When “ 
   
-P-A-G-E-254
  
  240 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
the average man looks at the friend with whom he is con- 
versing in the broad daylight, this friend is as real to the 
observer as anything can be. But let this same average man 
see this same friend approaching in the dim night, through 
a dense mist, before he has heard his voice, and he is very 
likely to find himself noting what is surely real as a mere 
experience (in fact often intensely real), but not real in the 
realm of realness of which we have been speaking above ; 
for he finds the question arising whether this real experience 
is due to the approach of a real man, or is due to some 
shadow of an inanimate object upon the mist. 
And so it is with our experiences of “images.” If I 
see a man clearly before me,—a real man I call him,—and 
then close my eyes, I have an image which is the real image 
of the man; but it is a presentation in a different realm of 
realness ; for note how, if I question myself, certain parts 
of this new presentation fail of realness as was not the case 
when my eyes were open. Are his eyes dark blue or dark 
brown? Is his hair slightly gray or i. brown? The 
realness of these parts of the presentation fail me. And if 
we consider the nature of such an object after lapse of time 
we find the characteristics about which realness cannot be 
asserted much increased in number. _ 
The most prominent constituents of our emotional pre- 
sentations are of a sensational nature, and we should therefore 
1The failure of the characteristics of realness occasioned by dimness 
of perception gives men so easily a sense of unrealness that such dim 
perceptions form the well known basis of fraudulent spiritualistic appear- 
ances, so called: in such cases so great is the sense of the unrealness of 
the appearance of the “medium”? as an object in the physical environment 
that many men and women fail to have the sense of this special form 
of realness in the outer world recalled, even if the man speak to them ;— 
they persist in holding that a “spirit” spoke, and not a dimly perceived 
man. Yet even these dupes of the trickster will declare that they have 
seen a real spirit ; it was no ordinarily embodied man they will say, but 
it was nothing less than a rea/ thing in ror phase of our experience.
-P-A-G-E-255
  REALNESS 241 
expect to find conditions prevailing in the emotional field 
similar to those noted in relation to sensation. Still here 
we note, more distinctly than in the case of sensations, 
differences of realness: for although most of our emotional 
states are thought of as very real, nevertheless we often are 
doubtful, for instance, whether we really are in love, or 
whether we really are afraid, or surprised. The same is the 
case with our impulses and efforts, where the most prominent 
constituents are also of a sensational nature. The mass of 
our impulses, and the bulk of our efforts, are very real: 
still here too we find ourselves at times in doubt; we often 
question, for instance, whether our nobler impulses are as 
real as we would have our friends think them to be; and 
at times we are convinced that our efforts are but half 
hearted, and unreal. 
It is in the realm of conception and thought however, 
where strong and reiterated stimuli are less common, that 
the varying grades of realness of special presentations become 
most evident to us. That our conceptions and thoughts in 
general shift their realness easily and rapidly is clear to all 
who watch the conceptual or thought trains in the course 
of a discussion in which the field of presentations is rapidly 
changed by the statement of diverse points of view. Most 
educated men who are without deep philosophical convictions 
will find the doctrine of the Absolute very real as they read 
Bradley or Royce, and will then find Pluralism just as real 
when they read James or Schiller. 
Sec. 14. This view that realness is a general quality of 
presentations is surely implicit in much of the best of current 
psychological writing, and especially in that of Dr. James, 
although so far as I know realness is not explicitly spoken 
of by him as a general quality of presentations ; and in fact 
I know of no psychologist except Miss Calkins? who has 
clearly expressed this view. I of course would not imply

that she would follow me in my development of this notion ; 
even as I would not have the reader ‘think that I have 
gained my view from her statement ; for these chapters were 
written in draft long before her book as referred to was 
published. We are probably both indebted to the implicit 
defence of this doctrine by James in his various writings.

THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY. PAIN AND PLEASURE

Sec. 1. In the chapters which have preceded this we have 
seen reason to conclude that there are certain general 
qualities, Intensity, Manifoldness, Realness, which in some 
measure attach to each noetic emphasis or presentation 
within consciousness ; and we are led to ask whether intro- 
spection serves to bring to light any other psychic qualities 
of the same general nature. 
In this search we naturally look for characteristic mental 
states of wide occurrence, and our first thought is of those 
most important states which we describe as our pleasures 
and pains, We at once find ourselves thrown off this track 
however by the very general acceptance by the common 
man of the notion that our pains are specific forms of 
sensation of the same type as touch, pressure, cold, taste, 
etc., and such sensations are surely not general qualities of 
all presentations. es 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
244 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
We must not be over hasty however in the acceptance of 
this common sense judgment; for the very first careful 
examination of the facts leads us to question its validity. 
The same common man who classes pains with sensations 
also shows by his word that he finds pleasures and pains in 
some way indissolubly related, a fact which the most careful 
introspection verifies, and which all authorities accept without 
hesitation. Notwithstanding this, the common man does 
not usually think of classifying pleasures with the sensations; 
and careful introspection leads us at once to question the 
propriety of such a classification of pleasure, which would 
seem forced upon us if we are to view pains as sensations. 
It seems possible then that we may have in pain not a 
form of the sensations, but a phase of a general quality 
which is usually emphatically noted in connection with 
sensations. We are thus led to study with renewed interest 
the nature of this indissolubly related pair, pain and pleasure; 
and it seems worth while to pass beyond the view of 
common sense to the consideration of the conceptions of 
those trained observers who have turned their attention to 
this subject. 
Sec. 2. In my Pain, Pleasure and Aesthetics 1 have treated 
so fully of the subjects of this chapter that I shall content 
myself here with a relatively brief discussion of the points to 
1In what follows there will be found no changes of conception, but a 
slight change of modes of expression ; the principal one of which is the 
abandonment of the description of the algedonic quality as a three-phased 
quality, one of which phases is “indifference.” As I held at the time of 
writing the book above mentioned, what we call “indifference” is a 
transition point at which both pleasure and pain disappear ; but it is a fair 
criticism that the mode of description adopted in my earlier work is 
misleading ; for if we describe this transitional situation as a phase of the 
algedonic quality we seem to imply that this indifference is an existence, as 
it were, below the threshold of consciousness. In what follows I therefore 
shall speak of the algedonic quality as a two-phased quality. I am indebted 
mainly to my friend, Prof. H. N. Gardiner, for the criticism that has led to 
this change.

be made; the reader who desires to study the full details of 
my arguments will find them, together with a critical 
examination of the theories suggested by others, in the work 
just mentioned. 
A study of these theories which have been presented to 
account for the nature of pleasure and pain brings before us 
the most diverse of hypotheses upheld by powerful thinkers. 
‘ We find it maintained by some, who are strongly influenced 
_ by the common sense view above referred to, or by a bias in 
favor of sensationalism, that pains are certainly sensations ; 
and in consideration of the general acknowledgment of the 
close bond existing between pain and pleasure we find some 
of these theorists courageously holding that pleasure, as well 
as pain, must be of a sensational nature. We find however, 
upon careful examination, as we have seen in Appendix A, 
Division I. Sec. 3, that this view cannot be maintained.! 
1 Confer Pain, Pleasure and Aesthetics, pp. 15-32. Also an article published 
by the writer in the Philosophical Review for Nov. 1892 under the title 
Pleasure-Pain and Sensation. Prof. Stumpf, as noted in Appendix A, 
Division I., has lately reiterated this view without adequate consideration of 
the objections to it. Prof. Max Meyer (Psychological Review, xv. 4 and 5) 
has made a strong and quite sufficient argument in opposition to Stumpf’s 
general position in this regard. He has also presented a new physiological 
theory which is succinctly stated as follows : “The correlate of pleasantness 
and unpleasantness is the increase or decrease of the intensity of a previously 
constant current if the increase or decrease is caused by a force acting at a 
point other than the point of sensory stimulation.” This theory agrees 
with mine in the important particular that it holds the physical correlate of 
pleasantness and unpleasantness to be a general process. On the other 
hand it does not appear to me to be as satisfactory as my theory, for it fails 
to explain many facts which mine accounts for. It does not explain, for 
instance, why it is that a muscle action beginning with pleasure, if persisted 
in or increased, becomes painful ? Why it is that mere rest of this muscle 
enables one to use it the next day with pleasure ; but again if one persists 
in the activity pain ensues? Why it is that if this muscle activity is per- 
sisted in from day to day for a long period it finally loses its painfulness ? 
Why it is that under persistent or increased stimulation a painful activity 
does not change into a pleasant one? Why it is, on the other hand, that

Again we find others of the highest standing as masters in 
psychology defending the hypothesis that pain and pleasure 
are emotions; or that the emotions are but associated 
“representations ” of pleasures and of pains. This view also 
is found to involve formidable difficulties.2 
We have further a set of writers who, dissatisfied with 
both of these theoretical positions, emphasize the importance 
of certain pleasant and unpleasant states which they describe 
as of an intellectual type, and which they justly claim to be | 
  at all events neither distinctly sensational nor distinctly | 
emotional. 
Arguments which may be brought forward in opposition 
to each of these broad classes of theories seem unanswerable, 
yet there appears to be force in the arguments in favor of 
each. This leads naturally to the suggestion that the masters 
who are thus opposed are probably each examining but a 
part of the algedonic field, and are theorizing with reference 
to that part which is most emphatic in their own experience. 
At all events it becomes clear in the course of this review of 
theories that pleasures and pains are given in connection with 
all sorts and kinds of specific presentations. 
It further becomes clear that pleasures and pains vary in 
degree ; and also that in many cases pleasures are displaced 
by pains, or pains displaced by pleasures, without a cor- 
responding variation or displacement of the specific presenta- 
tions in connection with which they appear. It also becomes 
clear that this displacement of pain by pleasure, or of 
under the same conditions a pleasant activity normally changes into a 
painful one? Why it is that, given a pleasant activity, a decrease of the 
activity does not bring pain, but does bring a mere decrease of pleasure ? 
Why it is that, given a painful activity, a decrease of the activity does not 
bring a greater pain but actually a decrease of pain? Why it is that, given 
a painful activity, increased activity does not bring pleasure instead of an 
increased pain?

THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 247 
pleasure by pain, involves a transitional state where no 
pleasure or pain is noticeable, and which is generally spoken 
of as the state of “indifference.” 
We are led therefore to consider still more favorably the 
hypothesis that pleasure and pain are phases of a general 
psychic quality, and this view we may state in the form of an 
hypothesis as follows. Pleasure-Pain is a general quality of all 
presentations, or noetic emphases. It is of a two-phased nature. 
In one phase or the other it qualifies all elementary psychic forms ; 
50 that, apart from the transitional “ indifference,’ one of these 
phases must, ana given the proper conditions either of these 
phases may, be attached to any psychic element. 
When I thus speak of pleasure and pain as qualities of 
presentations I of course do not use the word quality to 
refer to such qualities as differentiate sensations, ¢.g. color, 
tone, etc., as certain of my critics seem to have supposed. 
As noted in my book above referred to (e.g. p. 46) I use the 
term quality in a broader sense much as we may employ 
the word to apply to intensity ; in which sense it may be 
taken to be equivalent to the word, attribute, as employed 
by Titchener in discussing this subject.* ; 
The evidence favorable to this view has been presented so 
fully in my Pain, Pleasure and Aesthetics that I need not 
repeat it here. Kulpe, however, in his Grundriss d. Psycho- 
logie published about the same time as my book above 
referred to, and which did not come to my attention until 
after that book was printed, presented certain objections * to 
the qualitative theory, which gain importance because Stumpf? 
has lately quoted them as sufficing to warrant his failure to 
give any detailed consideration to this view ; and in the fact 
that Titchener in his late Psychology of Feeling and Attention *

248 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
published fifteen years after Kulpe wrote, follows Stumpf’s 
lead. 
The first and most significant of Kiilpe’s objections 
occurred to me after my book was in press, and quite 
independently of his criticism; but it appeared to me 
satisfactorily explicable and not important enough to make 
the basis of any special written discussion. 
In referring to this criticism we may well use Titchener’s 
phraseology ;' understanding that he uses the word “ affec- 
tion” in place of “feeling” to cover pleasure and pain. 
“Kiilpe points out,” he says, “that affection cannot be an 
attribute of sensation of the same sort as the recognized 
attributes, because it has attributes of its own. Sensations 
show differences of intensity, quality, time, and (in some 
instances) space ; affection shows differences of intensity, 
quality, and time.” 
Now when one speaks of the intensity or duration of a 
pain he is dealing with pain as viewed in reflection, and not 
with an experienced pain: and in such consideration we may 
use the phrase degree of pain, instead of the phrase intensity 
of pain, without any change of meaning. In exactly the 
same way we may consider intensity in reflection, and then 
may speak of its degrees. 
If it is held that the ascription of degrees to pain proves 
that pain cannot be an attribute of a presentation, then it 
would seem to follow that the ascription of degrees to 
intensity proves that intensity cannot be an attribute of a 
presentation ; which would of course be denied by my 
opponents. 
And the same may be said of duration. In the mood of 
reflection we may speak of the duration of an intensity as 
well as of the duration of a pain; and if it is held that the 
ascription of duration to a pain proves that pain is not an 
attribute of presentations ; then the ascription of duration to 
1 Ueber Gefiihlsempjindungen. Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie, xliv. 1906, p. 84.
-P-A-G-E-263
    ; THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 249 
an intensity proves that intensity is not an attribute of 
presentations ; which again would be denied. 
Of Kiilpe’s qualitative differences of pleasure and pain we 
need not speak at length, for his meaning is not clear to me, 
nor apparently to Titchener, who with his usual candor 
admits’ “I myself have never observed a qualitative 
differentiation of pleasantness-unpleasantness, under experi- 
mental conditions.” It may be well to repeat here that I 
use the word quality in a broader sense than that in which 
it is used in dealing with the distinction between specific 
sensations. 
We may turn now to Kulpe’s second difficulty, which 
we may again put in Titchener’s words.’ It is “that the 
annihilation of an attribute of sensation carries with it the 
disappearance of the sensation ; whereas a sensation may be 
non-affective, indifferent, and still be removed from dis- 
appearance.” My conception of indifference as a transition 
point between pleasure and pain will appear clearer below, 
but with this conception in view it seems to me that Kulpe’s 
second “ difficulty ” loses all force. It is of course true that 
a sensation does not disappear because it becomes what we 
call “indifferent”; but that is because its pleasure has been 
reduced to a minimum, as when perhaps it is about to give 
place to pain; or because its pain has been reduced to 
a minimum, as when perhaps it is about to give place 
to pleasure. Where the pleasure is of high degree the 
pleasure cannot suddenly disappear, unless the presentation 
to which the pleasure attaches also disappears ; and the same 
is true of pain of high degree. So it appears that there is 
no such sharp distinction between intensity and pleasure~ 
pain in this direction as the Ktlpe-Titchener objection would 
imply.

Sec. 3. If it is true that Pleasure-Pain is such a two- 
phased general psychic quality as we have above suggested, 
then if the theory of neururgic and noetic correspondence is 
valid, it would appear that the phases of this quality must 
correspond with some special forms of neural activity which 
may appear in connection with the functioning of any part 
of the nervous system. 
In turning our thought in this direction we are at once 
reminded of a theory which has been persistently suggested 
since the days of early Greek thought, and which relates 
pleasure to efficiency, and pain to inefficiency, in the activity 
of the individual who experiences the pleasure and pain: 
and this theory especially attracts us, who look for some 
neururgic characteristic corresponding to a hypothetical 
general quality of presentations, because efficiency and in- 
efficiency are evidently not special capacities in specific parts 
of the organism, but are general characteristics of organic 
life. It would therefore seem worth our while to study this 
special theory with some care. 
Sec. 4. When we turn to the examination of this theory 
as it was at first stated, relating pleasure to efficiency and 
pain to inefficiency of activity in the individual, we find that 
it displays inherent difficulties to which we can but briefly 
refer here. It is impossible for instance under the theory as 
thus stated to explain the existence of many pleasures which 
are evidently not connected with the individual’s efficient 
activity, (e.g. the pleasures of rest from bodily activity,) 
and many pains which are evidently not related to the 
individual’s organic inefficiency (¢.g. the pains of restriction 
which seem to be connected with diminution of activity, 
rather than with inefficient activity). 
Notwithstanding its weaknesses this theory has neverthe- 
less been thought by many psychologists to have intrinsic
-P-A-G-E-265
  
THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 251 
value, as is evidenced in the many attempts to so formulate 
it as to meet objection. In a modified form it has gained 
prominence in modern times because of its restatement in 
terms which aim to bring it into line with the theory of 
evolution ; it being held that pleasure and pain are coinci- 
dent not so much with efficient and inefficient actions in the 
individual as with actions beneficial and detrimental to the 
organism as a member of species. The theory even as thus 
restated is however found to be untenable when examined in 
detail. There are too many exceptions to this suggested 
law of correspondence to warrant its acceptance: too many 
pleasures in the individual are evidently detrimental to the 
race ; too many pains in the individual are as evidently of 
racial advantage. 
It seems possible however, as I have argued in the work 
above mentioned, to make another restatement of the theory 
which serves to meet the facts. If we hold, not that pleasure 
and pain relate respectively to the efficiency and inefficiency 
of the individual, or of the race, but that they relate respec- 
tively to the efficiency and inefficiency of the neural elements 
whose activity corresponds with the pleasant or painful 
presentations ; then, as I have attempted to show, the theory 
appears to become thoroughly defensible. And if this state- 
ment is correct the observed general, but not invariable, 
correspondence of pleasure with actions of value to the 
whole organism or to its species, and of pain with actions of 
disadvantage to the whole organism or to its species, is to be 
looked for. For it is apparent that if any individual exists 
whose general organic constitution is such that it as a whole 
tends to enforce the persistence of inefficient (and painful), 
and to curtail efficient (and pleasant), elemental activities, 
this individual will be at a disadvantage in the struggle 
of life ; while an individual will be at an advantage in this 
struggle whose organic constitution as a whole tends to 
encourage the persistence of efficient (and pleasant), and to
-P-A-G-E-266
    252 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL 
curtail inefficient (and painful), elemental activities. Hence 
in the long run we should expect to find what we do find, 
viz. a general correspondence between painful elemental 
activities and disadvantage to the individual, and to the 
species to which the individual belongs; and between 
pleasant elemental activities and advantage to the individual, 
and to his species: but also many exceptions to this general 
rule determined by the fact that the adjustment of elemental 
activities to meet the needs of the whole complex system of 
elements is at best only proximate. 
Let us attempt to present briefly the theory as it would 
appear in this modified form. 
Cc 
Sec. 5. If we consider the nature of the activity of a 
neural element we see that its form will be altered by 
changes in the capacity of the element to react to a stimulus 
reaching it. The nervous element may be so well-nourished 
that it will react (1) very forcibly to a given stimulus, 
which (2) under normal conditions would involve a much 
less degree of activity. On the other hand (3) it may be so 
ill-nourished that it will act but feebly to the same stimulus. 
At any one moment, one of these three conditions must 
prevail, but only one of the three can prevail ; and further- 
more, if the proper relation of stimulus to nourishment is 
given, any one of the three may prevail. This involves a 
general characteristic in connection with the elemental neural 
action which involves a norm (case 2), and departures from 
this norm in one of two opposite directions (cases 1 and 3). 
If stimuli reach a neural element when it is fully nourished 
it will react quickly and easily ; if the stimuli reach it when 
it is poorly nourished it will evidently react with difficulty. 
It is easy to see then that there will be for each neural 
element at each special moment what we may call a norm of 
activity : and that when the degree of energy of the stimulus
-P-A-G-E-267
  
_ THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 253 
| 
reaching the element calls for activity greater than this norm, 
and provided there is no unusual supply of nutriment to 
meet this demand : or when the stimulus reaches the neural 
element so frequently that the element has not time between 
the moments of the recurrence of stimulation to absorb from 
its environment sufficient nutriment to bring it up to its 
normal nutritive condition ; then the reaction of the element 
will be subnormal in relation to the stimulus received. 
It is equally clear that under conditions where a normal 
stimulus has not reached the neural element in normal 
rhythm, while the nutriment has been constantly absorbed, 
then the element will be more than normally nourished ; 
and when under such conditions a stimulus reaches it, it will 
be able to react hypernormally, using the surplus stored 
energy which has accumulated within it. 
It thus appears that each neural element must be con- 
ceived to be able to react in three phases; viz. sub-normally, 
normally, or hypernormally, under one and the same 
condition of stimulation; the difference being due entirely 
to varying and variable conditions of its nutrition, i.e. to 
varying and variable relations existing between the stimulus 
and the amount of potential energy within the element 
which may be transformed into kinetic energy. 
To put this in formal shape; if R represents a normal 
reaction to a normal stimulus S, we have 
a Stimulus S occasions reaction R—«, 
8 Stimulus S occasions reaction R, 
y Stimulus S occasions reaction R+x. 
In case a we have what we may call an inefficient reaction. 
In case 8 we have what we may call an equivalent reaction. 
In case y we have an especially efficient reaction. 
This characteristic of elemental nervous activity would be 
expected to appear in the complex neururgic system which 
corresponds with consciousness as we experience it, and  
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL. 
we are therefore led to look for a general quality of all 
presentations corresponding with the neururgic relations 
above described, which involves a norm and departures 
in opposite directions from this norm. And this quality 
would be of such a nature; 1st that, apart from the 
moment of transition, one of its two forms must prevail 
in connection with each psychic element as given within 
the complex presentation; 2nd that no more than one 
of these forms can prevail at the same time in connection 
with any given element; and 3rd that, given the proper 
conditions, either one of the forms may prevail in 
connection with a given element. 
Sec. 6. It is evident that if the hypothesis of a thorough- 
going noetic and neururgic correspondence is true we must 
expect to realize some difference of qualities in the psychic 
coincident of the activity of the neural element corre- 
sponding with the above mentioned different relations of 
the stimulus received and the capacity to react. These 
differences I conceive to be the basis of what we recognize 
in our conscious life as Pain, Indifference and Pleasure. 
Pain (a) corresponding to subnormal capacity for reaction 
in the neural element; Indifference (8), where both 
phases of the algedonic quality are absent, corresponding 
to normal capacity; Pleasure (y) corresponding to hyper- 
normal capacity. 
Sec. 7. The general ground for maintaining this view 
lies in the fact that the characteristics which we have 
above attributed to the neururgic quality determined by 
the relation of activity to capacity to react seem to be 
discoverable in relation to pleasure-pain phenomena. 
In the first place, as we have already seen, it is generally 
agreed that pain is in some way related to inefficiency, 
and pleasure to efficiency, of activity. Again what we 
call indifference appears as a norm in relation to both 
pleasure and pain, which themselves appear as departures
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 255 
from this norm, and in diametrically opposite directions. 
Again each presentation must involve either pain, or in- 
difference or pleasure; and, apart from complex states 
which are evidently in no sense elemental, no specific 
presentation can be qualified by more than one of the 
pleasure-pain phases in any one moment. Furthermore 
we have many experiences which tell us that what are 
practically the same presentations may be experienced 
under diverse conditions either as painful, or as indifferent, 
or as pleasant. 
Sec. 8. The position here taken may be stated in still 
another way. If it be held, as it generally is, that conscious 
experience is coincident with neural discharge; and if we are 
compelled to hold that a special qualification of the neural 
process will be determined by the relation between the 
stimulus received and the nutritive condition of the neural 
element which acts in the discharge; then we are surely led 
to look for some corresponding special qualification in the 
coincident psychic experience. This seems to me to be 
found in the pleasure-pain quality. If it is not found in 
this quality, then it is but just; either to demand of 
physiologists that they explain away the necessity of con- 
ceiving the diverse qualifications of discharge determined 
by the diversities of relation between the stimulus and the 
nutritive condition of the neural organ; or else to demand 
of the psychologists that they give us some inkling of the 
differentiation of psychic experience, other than pleasure- 
pain, which does correspond with this differentiation of 
the neural discharge. 
Sec. 9. It is easy to see that if simple neural elements 
exist in an environment from which nourishment can be 
readily absorbed, the condition 8 referred to in Sec. 5 
will be normal: and condition a always liable to occur: 
while condition y can occur only under special conditions. 
In other words under ordinary conditions the neural  
-P-A-G-E-270
    256 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
element will be prepared to react to normal stimuli; if 
the stimulus is hypernormal it will be unprepared usually 
to react to it fully: only under special conditions (eg. 
where a stimulus is normally regularly recurrent, and 
absorption constant, and where for some reason this normal 
stimulus has not been received,) will the nutritive condition 
of the element be such that it will react more fully than 
is demanded by the energy of the stimulus. Thus the 
psychic coincident of the neural elemental activity will 
under the hypothesis be at times indifferent, and often 
painful; and only under special conditions pleasant. It 
is apparent then that the absorption of nutriment and 
the capacity for such absorption is the important considera- 
tion in the determination of the form of neural activity 
which is coincident with the qualities of pain and pleasure 
in the psychic elements. 
Sec. 10. When we turn to the study of consciousness 
as we experience it, and consider it as a noetic system 
coincident with the activity of a neural system, we note some 
important modifications of the simple relations thus far pre- 
sented : for thus far we have been considering psychic and 
neural elements in themselves. 
In the neural system of man the nourishment of the 
parts of the system is brought to them by the blood supply. 
This supply is variable under different conditions, and is 
governed by a special mechanism so that demands for 
activity due to the reception of stimuli are followed, after 
longer or shorter intervals, by increased supply of nutriment 
brought from afar to supply the waste. In such a complex 
system the emphatic activity stimulated in any part which 
is just able to react equivalently to the stimulus will under 
our view have as its psychic coincident an “ indifferent” 
presentation which involves neither pain nor pleasure, and 
when the stimulus demands activity which cannot appear we 
shall have coincidently a presentation of painful quality. But
-P-A-G-E-271
I 
| 
THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 257 
note that in this latter case the mechanism which governs 
the nutriment of the system will press forward a supply to 
meet this demand; and if the demand cease this supply 
thus started towards the just-active element will, by what I 
have elsewhere called a process of “nutritive momentum,” 
| be carried to the just-active element, which will be more 
| than normally nourished,—will gain a surplus store of 
i potential energy,—so that if a stimulus again reaches it 
| without too great delay the reaction will be more vigorous 
than is normally called for by the stimulus received, and the 
psychic coincident will be a presentation of pleasant phase. 
It thus appears that im general, in the growth of neural 
systems, special parts will acquire capacity to store surplus 
force only as the result of previous excessive stimulation ; 
and that correspondingly on the psychic side the capacity 
to experience pleasure in connection with any presentation 
will depend upon the previous experience of a pain in 
connection with the antecedent of this presentation. It is 
because of this hypothetical primacy of pain that it seems 
proper to place the word pain before the word pleasure in 
a description of the general quality we are considering, and 
for this reason I named my first book Pain, Pleasure, and 
Aesthetics, and gave to the Science of Pain and Pleasure 
the name Algedonics (@A-yos-jdovj).1. In the very first 
1Tt is to be noted here, however, that there are many cases where this 
general primacy of pain will not hold. In a.complex neural system, like that 
of man, one part may demand extra nourishment ; and this nourishment, 
not being called for when it reaches the organ for which it is intended, may 
be distributed in connected parts which will be thus placed in condition to 
act with pleasant coincidents, without a previous excessive demand with 
painful coincident. Again ; inasmuch as we inherit from our ancestors a 
tendency to develop in certain special directions ; so the capacity to store 
surplus force in any special neural part may be due to this inherit- 
ance, and may not be due to any excessive activity with painful coincidents 
within our own experience, although excessive activity accompanied by pain 
in the experience of our ancestors may have originally had to do with the 
capacity to store surplus force which developes with our growth.

  258 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
article written by me on this subject for Mind, I used the 
term pleasure-pain ; and this phrase, both because it is more 
euphonious than pain-pleasure, and because it has become 
current, I occasionally employ. 
Sec. 11. Ina previous chapter we noted that if intensity 
is an elemental quality, then as we appreciate it as a char- 
acteristic of a system of psychic elements it can appear only 
as transformed: and under our view the same must be 
true of the algedonic quality. It becomes evident there- 
fore that it will be impossible to raise our statement above 
the position of a highly probable hypothesis, for the simple 
reason that we are unable on the one hand to isolate neural 
elements in our own bodies, and to govern accurately the 
relations of stimulus to nutrition ; or on the other hand to 
experience introspectively the isolated psychic states corre- 
sponding with the hypothetical elemental neural activities. 
Nevertheless it will become apparent, I think, in the discus- 
sion to follow that this hypothesis is warranted by our 
experience of complex states, in which pain and pleasure 
appear as phases of a general quality of psychic phenomena, 
which evidently are not determined by the complexity of 
consciousness as we experience it, but by elemental differ- 
ences determined in turn by conditions which seem without 
doubt to be coincident with varying relations between stimu- 
lation and organic nutrition. 
Sec. 12. It is also to be noted here, as we have noted in 
connection with each of the general qualities in Group I., 
that when pleasure, or pain, are recognized as such, they are 
appreciated in reflection in themselves as presentations of 
specific forms. The recognition of the algedonic phase of 
any given presentation involves the appearance of a special 
“sense of relation”? which is as definite a presentation in 
reflection as is any other of those senses of relation of 
which we have spoken elsewhere at length. When we 
appreciate a degree of pleasure, or a degree of pain, it is 
   
-P-A-G-E-273
  THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 259 
because one of two special senses of relation is given at the 
moment. 
Sec. 13. Such is the hypothesis in outline: in what 
follows we shall consider certain arguments in favor of this 
hypothesis. Before doing so however I wish to emphasize 
the fact that the important point to be verified is the purely 
psychological theory. In my view the neururgic hypothesis 
which I have presented is very probably a valid one: but 
even if it were shown to be utterly groundless this would 
not take from the fact that pain and pleasure are phases of a 
general quality of all elements of consciousness, either of 
which under the proper conditions may attach to each 
psychic element; and, apart from the transitional situation 
of indifference, one of which must thus attach to each 
element. Even if the neururgic theory here upheld is found 
to be inadequate, some new form of neururgic theory must 
be looked for which will be compatible with the general 
nature of pleasure-pain as above described, and which is 
clearly given in our experience. 
dla A: 
Sec. 14. Let us now examine the introspective evidence 
bearing upon the psychological theory presented above: in 
connection with this examination, noting incidentally the 
correspondence of this psychological theory with the neu- 
rurgic theory which I have developed more fully in my book 
above mentioned. 
Sec. 15a. It will serve our purpose best to begin with 
the consideration of the transitional situation where both pain 
and pleasure disappear, and which we call indifference. If 
our neururgic theory is warranted it is clear that any neural 
part may have capacity exactly and only just equalized’ to 
1] use the word equalized here and elsewhere to indicate the very 
evident fact that in many cases the normal situation involves a greater
-P-A-G-E-274
260 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
  the demand involved in the stimulus that comes to it. 
Evidently this exact equivalence will probably seldom if ever 
be actually reached : nevertheless, on the other hand, there 
will often be a near approach to this equivalence ; and with 
organs habitually reacting to what seem constant stimuli, or 
to those of regular and rapidly recurring rhythm, we should 
expect to find a wide region of activity very close to this 
theoretical equivalence, and vibrating as it were very slightly 
on either side of it. Practically such a condition is indeed 
normal where the stimulation to activity is constant, as in 
the case of the activities of such neural parts as those 
relating to breathing and to the circulation of the blood. 
Sec. 156. The state of indifference is in our view the 
psychic correspondent of this neururgic equivalence. So far 
as I can judge from introspection, it is merely a passing 
stage which is neither noticeably pleasant nor noticeably 
painful. Although under our theory the existence of in- 
difference in connection with any given presentation must 
always be possible, strictly speaking such total indifference is 
seldom noted. On the other hand a condition varying so 
slightly either towards pain or towards pleasure as to be 
practically indifferent is very often reached, and is in fact 
normal for those presentations that are coincident with wide 
systemic activities. It is true that there are certain mental 
experiences which never appear quite indifferent to us, but 
this as we shall presently see is because in such cases the 
conditions of indifference do not in fact arise. This how- 
ever does not take from the fact that these conditions might 
possibly arise: and if they did so arise then, under this view, 
these experiences would be called indifferent. What we call 
indifference then is mere absence of either pleasure or pain. 
display of energy in the reaction than is given in the stimulus. The sense 
organs are thus centres of explosion as it were. But the force of these 
explosions themselves may vary from subnormal through the normal to the 
hypernormal,

  THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 261 
As we shall see in the next chapter it has its counterpart 
in presentness within the time flow. 
Sec. 16a. Turning to the consideration of pain; we note 
that under our theory we should expect to find that in 
general, if the proper conditions are given, any presentation 
may appear in painful phase. For it is clear that, even if 
capacity for the storage of surplus energy exists, this store 
of surplus energy may always be drawn off by excessive or 
prolonged activity ; and there can be no case therefore in 
which it is impossible to conceive the conditions existing 
where the amount of energy demanded by the stimulus in 
reaction will be greater than the amount actually appearing 
in the reaction. 
Sec. 16d. In psychological terms this would read, there 
is no case in which a presentation will not appear in painful 
phase if its intensity becomes sufficiently great, or if the 
presentation persists long enough. There may be cases, 
however, where the presentation always disappears before it 
can reach the painful phase. 
I think all must agree that the persistence of a presentation 
that was not originally painful finally results in the attach- 
ment of pain to the maintained presentation. In our 
sensational experience it is very common to observe pleasant 
presentations which if maintained with sufficient intensity 
lose their pleasure and then become disagreeable. It is true 
that excessive stimulation is so dangerous to certain of the 
sense terminals that nature has provided them with pro- 
tective organs which are so usually effective in preventing 
excessive stimulation that instances of it are noted with 
difficulty : but such cases do not appear to be adverse to 
the position here maintained. I have discussed this matter 
so fully in my book above referred to that it does not 
seem necessary to say more than that I know of no sensa- 
tional experience which, even if pleasant normally, cannot 
be experienced disagreeably if intensity be increased or 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
    262 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL. 
prolonged. What is more, there are many sensations which 
as a rule are very nearly indifferent and scarcely traceable in 
pleasant phase, which may appear painful in the extreme, 
under serious over-exercise. The conscious states connected 
with the intestinal activities are usually thus indifferent until 
some time when subject to excessive stimulation they give 
excruciating pain. 
Turning to the emotions we may take the case of Joy as 
typical. Joy is clearly an emotion, and it also is justly 
looked upon as a typical state of pleasure-getting. But 
notwithstanding this usual connection with pleasure, excess 
of joy brings an exhaustive pain from which often the name 
joy may be altogether detached, although “a joy which is 
almost pain” is a recognized state. 
Looking beyond emotion, we see that any content of 
thought, if steadily presented with intensity, becomes painful. 
As Mrs. Browning in one of her sonnets says— 
Oh, entertain (cried Reason as she woke) 
Your best and gladdest thoughts but long enough 
And they will all prove sad enough to sting, 
Perhaps our poetess may be thought to refer not to the 
thoughts themselves but to states collateral with them. And 
in fact we tend to turn so quickly from thoughts as soon as 
they begin to lose their delight that we find it necessary to 
step beyond the normal for clear verification in this particular. 
When we do so we note the severe pain connected with those 
1 Mr. Spencer has indeed stated that there are certain sensations, such as 
sweetness, which can never be disagreeable, however intense they are. It 
is true that certain tastes which are usually pleasant are so identified in 
name with the pleasure quality that the ordinary man fails to use the same 
term in describing the painful phase of the same presentation: and this is 
what happens in relation to sweetness. Mr. Spencer’s illustration however 
is not a happy one: for sweetness if intense is exceedingly disagreeable to 
some people within my experience ; and even I, who am ordinarily fond 
of sweets, find no difficulty in obtaining disagreeableness from an excessive 
stimulus in this direction.
-P-A-G-E-277
THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 263 
morbid cases of idées fixes which seem to present the typical 
disease of attention. Beyond this, in cases of extreme weak- 
ness any thought is found to be painful, as is also true when 
we have long been mentally active, and are “too tired to 
think,” as we say. 
Sec. 174. Turning now to the consideration of pleasure 
we note that under our theory we should expect to find that 
in general, if the proper conditions are given, any presenta- 
tion may appear in its pleasant phase. For it is clear that 
even where there is an approach to the equivalence between 
stimulation and blood supply spoken of above when we were 
considering indifference, the inconstancy of environmental 
conditions makes it probable that for the great mass of 
organs there will be sufficient inconstancy of stimulus to 
bring about some capacity for storage of surplus force, how- 
ever small; and hence capacity for the use of this surplus 
stored force, even though this use may be possible for a very 
short time only. This storage-capacity will vary in amount 
somewhat in proportion to the variability of the stimulus 
and to the importance of vigorous action whenever the 
stimulus occurs. 
Sec. 174. In psychological terms this may be stated as 
follows. Any presentation may carry pleasure with it under 
proper conditions, although the pleasure may be of very 
low degree and of very short duration. The capacity for 
pleasure-getting in connection with any special presentation 
will depend upon the variability of the appearance of the 
presentation in attention, and upon its importance in the life 
of the individual. 
It seems to me that almost any sensation may be noted in 
pleasant phase if we will but watch for the pleasure. And if 
some sensations appear to be disagreeable even at their lowest 
intensity it is possible to hold that this is due to the fact that 
we cannot, with available means of stimulation, arouse the 
sensation at all at a sufficiently low intensity to observe its 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  
  264 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
pleasant phase, attention being retained. For instance, the 
sensations which are usually thought of as always painful, 
and never pleasant, e.g. cutting, laceration, etc., are accom- 
panied by conditions which in all cases involve excessive 
stimulation. Neuralgic pains are so excessive that the pre- 
sentations to which they are attached themselves lose all 
prominence in attention and we have in the focus of attention 
only the pain “sense of relation,” and do not recognize the 
pleasant phase of the same, if it occurs, as in any way related 
to our state of previous agony. 
Turning to the emotions: all will agree I think that fear 
is generally looked upon as a most painful state: it can 
indeed with difficulty be separated from spasmodic violent 
reactions which are necessarily painful. If however we pay 
close attention to the muscular components of fear, which 
are the psychic elements that specially differentiate the state 
from all others, I think it not impossible to trace it in 
pleasurable phase. Let one, walking in the darkness and 
hearing footsteps behind him, deliberately quicken his pace, 
as I have often done as an experiment, and he will catch the 
beginnings of the marked components of fear, but not 
unpleasantly. There is a well-known fascination which leads 
boys and men to go as near to dangers as they dare, and 
then flee from them: fascination implies pleasure-getting 
in connection with the activities involved, and in my view 
these pleasures are characteristics of presentations which in 
their painful phase make the body of the emotion of fear. 
A large proportion of our thinking appears to me to be 
mildly pleasant. Where it is painful we divert our thoughts 
—that is, we restrict the appearance of a given presentation 
which has become too constant,—so that when it arises 
naturally after a time of rest the pain is gone, and we grasp 
the thought as we do only when we are gainers of pleasure. 
Sec. 18. If it is true that pleasure and pain are character- 
istics of psychic elements as these appear in the psychic system
-P-A-G-E-279
  
THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 265 
which we speak of as consciousness; then clearly each minor 
presentation within the whole noetic pattern that is not 
indifferent must have its special pleasure-pain quality ; and 
it is equally evident that the phase of this quality may differ 
in connection with the several minor presentations in a 
complex state. It thus appears that we ought at times to 
experience mixed states of pleasure and of pain: and this 
expectation is certainly realized. I may have a painful 
toothache, while at the same moment I experience a very 
pleasant taste of sugar which has started the throb of pain 
by action upon an irritated tooth nerve. We may have 
what are commonly called “mixed feelings”: Juliet’s 
plaintive expression that “parting is a sweet sorrow” 
describes such a state where marked pain accompanies one 
minor presentation, and marked pleasure another, in the 
whole complex presentation of a single moment. 
We should expect also to find cases where the psychic 
elements which are not within the field of attention would 
display minor degrees of either pleasure or pain, which 
massed together as it were would give a sense of well being 
or ill being. Such states are familiar to us all. This psychic 
mass as I shall attempt to show in a future chapter is what 
the ordinary man speaks of as “feeling” ; and it is natural 
therefore that we should come to view these cases, where 
broad but not vivid pleasures and pains well up from the 
depths of consciousness, as developments of this realm of 
“feeling,” as we certainly most commonly do. 
And at this point it may be well to call attention to the 
fact that I break away from the habit of many of our 
modern psychologists, and avoid altogether the use of the 
word “feeling” in connection with the phenomena of 
pleasure-pain. It is not unusual, as the reader will recall, 
to find pleasure-pain referred to as a form of, if not the 
basis of, this so called “feeling.” That there is a close 
bond between this so called “feeling” and pleasure-pain 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  266 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL. 
phenomena is of course true, and an attempt to explain the 
nature of this bond more fully will be made when the nature 
of “feeling” is discussed. Here it is merely necessary to 
state that, whatever this relation may be, pleasure and pain 
are not to be identified with this “feeling” in any sense ; 
nor are various forms of this “feeling” to be considered 
as derivatives of pleasure and pain. ” 
B 
Sec. 19. The point made in the last section; viz. that 
we may have diverse pleasure-pain phases in one and the 
same total complex presentation, is of importance in relation 
to certain pleasure-pain experiences which we shall now 
consider. 
All of the forms of pleasure and pain thus far studied 
have been those which are characteristic of presentations 
which exist as spontaneous or enforced objects of attention : 
all have been referred to what is often spoken of as an 
emphatic degree of psychic activity, for it is the consideration 
of pleasures and pains connected with the activities of life 
that have led to the theoretical position thus far taken. 
But there are certain prominent forms of both pain and 
pleasure which are connected in our minds with presentations 
the development of which in attention is restricted ; forms 
of pain and pleasure which in other words seem to be due 
to cessation of what is spoken of as psychic activity. What 
I wish to note here is that in such cases the pains and 
pleasures are not connected with the prominent presentation 
which is restricted in its development in attention, but to 
other less emphatic partial presentations within the whole 
complex of the moment. 
Sec. 20. Let us first consider the pains of restriction. In 
the first place we have the well recognized pains due to 
thwartings, to disappointments, of one form or another. In 
all such cases the painfulness is clearly attached to other
-P-A-G-E-281
THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY 267 
partial presentations than that emphatic partial presentation 
the development of which appears to be inhibited. The 
pains in such cases are of the massive type, summations of 
minor pains which are well distributed, and not infrequently 
localized as distributed in “feelings” of malaise and un- 
easiness referred to the broad somatic system. 
In the second place we have the pains of craving. That 
the pains are here also of the broad, massive, summational 
type is clear: and here too they seem without question to be 
attached to other partial presentations than that emphatic 
presentation the development of which appears to be in- 
hibited. In the realm of sensation this certainly requires no 
illustration. In the realm of emotional and intellectual 
activity it is as clearly exemplified, if we acknowledge as I 
hold that craving and desire are closely allied. The thinker 
also whose habit of attention to his thought-sequences is 
interrupted finds himself experiencing very much the same 
indefinite uneasiness which the active man feels after pro- 
longed muscular restraint. 
The physical conditions which accompany cravings and 
desires involve rest in the organic parts the natural action of 
which is inhibited, and therefore the storage in these parts of 
surplus energy which is at once used up (with accompanying 
pleasure) when the inhibition is removed. Such being the 
case we are not surprised to find that when a presentation 
has thus been restricted painfully, its rise into attention is 
always pleasant in some degree, as it corresponds with an 
efficient nervous activity ; and the pleasure be it noted is 
then more or less clearly involved with the presentation 
which is no longer inhibited, as was not the case with the 
antecedent pain of restriction ; and this pleasure is usually 
proportionate to the degree of the anterior widely diffused 
pains of craving. 
That is to say, all satisfactions of cravings and desires are 
in themselves pleasant, and the vividness of the pleasure 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
gained is in general proportionate to the strength of the 
cravings or desire which has preceded. I think there will be 
no question raised as to the validity of this law in its widest 
range. The common proverb “hunger is the best sauce” 
is of more than sensational significance. 
Sec. 21. We may now turn to those forms of pleasure 
which are connected in our minds with presentations the 
development of which in attention is restricted. I refer here 
of course to the pleasures of rest after arduous work, of relief 
from painful strain of one kind or another. Here it seems 
very clear again that the pleasure is of a broad, massive, 
summational type; and that it is not attached to the 
presentation which has been painfully developed in attention: 
it is the very waning or loss of this presentation within the 
field of attention which brings the pleasure in other less 
emphatic minor presentations which are broadly distributed, 
so to speak, in the noetic pattern of the moment. 
Sec. 22. The relation of the phases of the algedonic 
quality to the efficiency of the unemphasized psychic system 
is marked and is distinctly corroborative of the theory here 
presented. It will be more convenient to consider this 
subject in a later chapter where we treat of the relation of 
the algedonic quality to attention. \

  SUB-DIVISION II. GENERAL QUALITY DETERMINED IN 
NATURE BY THE COMPLEXITY OF PRESENTATIONS 
CHAPTER XII 
THE TIME QUALITY. PASTNESS-PRESENTNESS- 
FUTURENESS 
I 
Sec. 1. In the course of our study of the nature of the 
general qualities of Group 1. we noted that Intensity would 
inhere in the psychic element if such could be isolated ; 
while Manifoldness and Realness are determined not by the 
nature of the hypothetical psychic element, but by the 
complex nature of presentations. In the previous chapter 
we have considered the Algedonic Quality, a general quality 
appearing in two phases,—pain and pleasure,—which we 
discover in our complex presentations as experienced, but 
which we have concluded would inhere in the psychic 
element if such could be isolated; and it is natural now 
to ask whether there is any general quality of all presenta- 
tions of a similar nature which would not be given but 
for the complexity of presentations. 
When we turn our thought in this direction we cannot 
but be struck by the fact that our experiences in relation to 
time have a very marked similarity in many respects with 
our experiences of the algedonic quality. As with the 
algedonic quality, the time quality, if we may so speak, (a) 
displays two marked phases, past time, and future time ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  270 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
which appear as departures in opposite directions from an 
elusive state which we call present time. We note also (@) 
that either pastness or presentness or futureness seems 
necessarily attached to each presentation ; and that any one 
of them seems to be attachable to any given presentation if 
the proper conditions are given. We note also (vy) that 
each of the three seems to be exclusive of the other two in 
relation to any special presentation ; and that (0) past time, 
and future time, appear as contradictory opposites, while the 
third appears as a norm of transition, as it were, from which 
the other two seem to depart in opposite directions. Let us 
consider for a moment somewhat more in detail the facts 
which suggest this likeness of form between algedonic and 
time phases. 
Sec. 2. (a) In the first place it seems fairly clear that 
each presentation within consciousness, when considered 
from a special point of view, is discovered to be describable 
either as relating to the past, or to the present, or to the 
future. It is true of course that we often experience 
presentations without appreciating their time relations, just 
as we experience presentations without appreciating their 
intensity, or their algedonic quality; but no presentation 
seems to arise without displaying characteristics which may 
lead to the appreciation of some time phase, so that it is 
then found to display either what we may speak of as 
presentness, or else pastness, or else futureness. 
(6) In the second place we note many cases where what 
we call the same presentation displays the different time 
phases under different conditions : e.g. this moment’s thought 
‘a game of golf” may have pastness if I played yesterday, 
or presentness if I am in the midst of the game, or future- 
ness if I am on my way to the golf course. Furthermore 
there may be a rapid shifting from one time phase to 
another without other noticeable change in the presentation : 
when walking to the golf course the thought “game of 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
THE TIME QUALITY 271 
golf” may be placed now in the past, and immediately 
afterwards in the future. 
Again there are cases where, provided we recognize 
multiple emphases within the same complex presentation, 
we seem to note all of the time phases together ; one being 
given emphatically, the others dimly: consciousness thus 
appears as involving a present, together with what Prof. 
James calls “backward and forward fringes.” This would 
indicate that as each presentation is highly complex, so the 
parts of the complex may appear in different time phases at 
one and the same moment ; very much as we note summa- 
tional states of mixed pleasure and pain. 
(y) But evidently even where this occurs it appears that 
prominence of one time phase in relation to a given presen- 
tation excludes the prominence of either of the other two 
time phases at the same moment. The same idea cannot be 
thought of as distinctly present, and at the same moment 
either as past or future; nor as distinctly past, and at the 
same moment as present or future ; nor as distinctly future, 
and at the same moment as present or past. 
(6) It is so clear that past time and future time are 
appreciated as contradictory opposites, and that present time 
is as it were a zorm in relation to which the past and future 
are estimated, that no further comment in relation to this 
point is necessary here. 
This view serves to strengthen our first suggestion ; and 
evidently makes it worth while to look into the matter more 
carefully. 
Il 
Sec. 3. At the very start it may be well to say a word to 
forestall criticism from some reader to whom it may occur 
that in any discussion of the nature of the time quality we 
must find ourselves assuming a time series in the objective 
world, and events in time ; and that we will thus be found 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
| | 
272 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
to base our explanations upon data which involve the appre- 
hension of time itself. For we have reason to contend that 
as psychologists we are fully warranted in this procedure. 
We assume successive events exactly as we assume the 
existence of objects in the outer world. All of common 
speech, and all of scientific expression, involve the assump- 
tion of the existence of objects in the hal world, and 
involve in like manner the assumption of what we call | 
successions of changes in this outer world of objects. The 
difficulties referred to are of a metaphysical nature with | 
which the psychologist as such does not directly concern 
himself. In the words of Dr. James Ward! we “have not 
to ask how time itself comes to be, but assuming it to be, 
we ask how the individual comes to know it.” Assuming 
the existence of successive moments of time in the life of a 
complex neural system, and in that of a coincident con- 
sciousness which is a complex psychic system, it is our 
object to enquire into the nature of the quality given in any 
special moment,—any ‘“‘now” of this psychic existence,— 
by the fact that this special moment was preceded by, and 
will be followed by, other special moments,—by other 
“nows.” 
Sec. 4. But although we might thus waive this difficulty 
we do not find it altogether necessary to do so. For if we 
assume the time quality to be a general quality of presenta- 
tions, then it is true here, as we have remarked in reference 
to each of the general qualities already described, that when 
1 Encyclopedia Britannica Article, Psychology, p. 64. Confer also Dr. Stout 
in his Manual of Psychology, p. 384, where he says “ Without ideal represen- 
tation there could be no such thing as the definite apprehension of a time 
series, having a distinguishable beginning and end, connected by a train of 
intermediate events, each having its own position in the series determined 
by its relations to other events which come before and after it. For per- 
ceptual consciousness it is evident that time cannot exist in this form. On 
the other hand we find in perceptual consciousness those primary experi- 
ences on which our developed apprehension of time is ultimately based.”
-P-A-G-E-287
  
THE TIME QUALITY 273 
timeness in any of its phases is recognized as such it is 
appreciated in reflection in itself as a presentation of a 
specific form. The recognition of the time phase of any 
given presentation involves the appearance of a special wave 
form in our symbolic noetic pattern ; it involves a special 
“sense of relation” which is as definite a presentation in 
consciousness as is any other of the senses of relation. 
When we appreciate the time phase of a given presentation 
it is because its special ‘sense of relation” is given at the 
moment. 
When we assume the existence of successions of pre- 
sentations we are really experiencing in the “now” a given 
complex presentation in which we appreciate a number of 
minor presentations together with a recognition of a relation 
of succession between them: and evidently we are then 
dealing with what is a very different thing from a descrip- 
tion of the successive presentations themselves... If we 
refer to three specific presentations say, 1, 2 and 33; we 
grasp them as a series of any kind in a complex presenta- 
tion of multiple emphasis which may be symbolized thus: 
The “sense of relation” which 
1, plus 2, plus 3, plus} we describe as the relation 
peculiar to the series.

we grasp them as a time series in a complex presentation 
1 For clear statements of this distinction, confer Stout, Manual of Psychology, 
p. 385, and Royce, World and the Individual, ii. pp. 115 ff. As Dr. Jas. Ward 
says (Encyclopedia Britannica Article, p. 66) “On the whole we may con- 
clude that our concrete time experiences are due to simultaneous repre- 
sentations of a series of definite presentations both accompanied and 
separated by more or fewer indefinite presentations more or less confused ; 
that, further, the definite presentations have certain marks or temporal 
signs due to the movement of attention ; that the rate of these movements 
or accommodations is approximately constant, and that each movement 
itself is primarily experienced as an intensity.” 
s 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
of multiple emphasis which may be symbolized as 
follows : 
The “sense of relation” which 
we describe as the relation 
pb plus , plus - plus; involving pastness, present- 
ness, or futureness as the 
case may be. 
It would appear then that the pastness of a given pre- 
sentation is appreciated because of the emphasis of a certain 
specific sense of relation ; and that presentness, and future- 
ness, are appreciated because of the emphasis of certain 
other but closely related senses of relation: and we thus 
see that in this study we are dealing altogether with an 
analysis of what we assume may be certain aspects of all 
forms of presentation. 
Il 
Sec. 5. In beginning the study of the hypothesis before 
us we must note certain points of significance which require 
full explanation if it is true that the appreciation of time 
is due to the existence of a general quality which is 
attached, if we may so speak, in one phase or another to 
each presentation. 
It will be necessary in the first place to account for the 
fact briefly referred to above, that while from one point 
of view each presentation in a given moment is appreciated 
as in a sense qualified by one, and only one, of what we 
may call the three time phases; nevertheless that from 
another point of view every presentation which is distinctly 
recognized as present,—as qualified by presentness,—has 
attached to it also something of both pastness and of 
futureness in what Dr. James calls the “backward and 
forward fringes.”! It is this fact that leads us to describe 
consciousness as a whole as a stream, in part ever flowing 
1Confer W. James, Psychology, vol. i. ch. ix.
-P-A-G-E-289
THE TIME QUALITY 275 
toward us, in part being with us, in part ever flowing from 
us: a stream which appears constantly to leap as does a 
torrent over a brink, from which it approaches and passes 
us by, like a river across a broad plain until lost in the 
vague horizon mists. 
Sec. 6. We find another point of significance in the fact 
that in speaking of consciousness thus as a stream we are 
using spatial terms. And when we think of it we find that 
we are in the habit of thus employing spatial terms constantly 
in our references to time: the past is felt to be fittingly 
described as that in our experience which is going from us ; 
the future as that in our experience which is coming to us ; 
the present as that in our experience which is here with 
us. This use of terms would surely seem to indicate that 
the form of presentations given whenever we recognize 
pastness, is given with especial emphasis in connection with 
our perception of objects in the outer world from which we 
are being separated; that the form given whenever we 
recognize futureness, is given with especial emphasis in 
connection with our perception of objects in the outer world 
to which we are approaching, or which are approaching us ; 
and that the form given whenever we recognize presentness, 
is one which is emphasized when objects in the outer world 
which attract our notice are in a stationary relation to us. 
The significance of this point will appear as we proceed. 
Sec. 7. We may note here also another significant point ; 
viz. that this time stream moves always in one direction. 
As we have seen above, in considering in reflection the time 
quality as a whole we are dealing with the appreciation of 
the characteristics of a series of presentations in one complex 
presentation. Now spatial series, for instance, when thus 
studied, may be considered equally well from right to left 
or from left to right, up and down or down and up. But 
such is not the case with the time series. And evidently as 
Prof. Royce says ‘‘ this direction of the stream of time forms 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  276 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
one of its most notable characteristics.” Even when we 
consider reversible spatial series, through them all appear 
the temporal characteristics of the stream of presentations 
itself which is always in our direction and irreversible. 
When we contemplate spatial or similar series we appreciate 
no sense of aid or opposition in them due to the existence of 
a steady current, as it were: but when we contemplate the _ 
time series we always do appreciate the influence of a current 
moving inevitably in one direction, with which we move 
easily, against which we must struggle if we are to maintain 
our position, 
Sec. 8. Finally we are led to note another point which 
we will find to have especial significance, viz, that the several 
time phases, inclusive of what we call the present, always 
appear as related to what we in reflection perceive to be 
really not of the present, but of the just past. Even our 
every day “present” is really a secondary presentation or 
revival ; it is a state of reflection, in a given “now,” upon 
what is a just-gone; and this fact has led Mr. E. R. Clay 
to describe what we in common language call the present, as 
a “specious present.’’ In what follows when I speak of 
presentness, or of the present, I refer to this form discovered 
in revivals, i.e. to what we would call in Clay’s phraseology 
“specious presentness” and the “specious present”; and 
do not refer to the “now” of experience in which this is 
appreciated. 
Sec. 9, The fact referred to in Sec. 7, viz. that the time 
series moves in one direction only, and that this direction of 
the flow is irreversible, would seem to indicate that what we 
speak of as the three time phases are due to modifications of 
one general characteristic of successive presentations as these 
are appreciated in a complex presentation of reflection. The 
fact referred to in Sec. 8, viz. that all presentations upon 
close inspection appear to be relegated to the past, surely 
means that the pastness sense of relation is more pervasive
-P-A-G-E-291
    THE TIME QUALITY 277 
than the presentness or futureness senses of relation: and 
this would seem to imply that in pastness we have the 
general characteristic of successive presentations just referred 
to; and that in considering the time quality we are dealing 
with a general typical form of all presentations which is 
markedly emphasized in those cases in which distinct past- 
ness is recognized ; which is not thus emphasized in those 
cases in which presentness (or “specious presentness’’) is 
recognized ; and which is considerably modified in those 
cases in which futureness is recognized. For such a typical 
form of all presentations, which is thus modified when the 
time phases are definitely appreciated, we may well make 
search. 
IV 
Sec. 10. It is evident from what we have just said that 
we are likely to be repaid by a careful examination of the 
characteristic of pastness which is evidently a more pervasive 
form of presentations than either presentness or futureness. 
When we study pastness with care we note the fact that 
it is always connected with a reduction of presentative 
complexity. As Herbert Nichols well says; “In order to 
perceive Past, some sensation or image must cease ; when- 
ever any such ceases, we perceive Past. The ceasing of the 
perception is the perception of Past ; did no perception ever 
cease we should never perceive or know anything whatever 
regarding Past, or pastness, or about the Past... For 
any apperception of Past the cessation of some sensation or 
image must call up some idea of Past, of something 
ceasing.” We are thus led to see that the nature of the 
complexity of successive presentations may well be of im- 
portance in relation to the existence of the time quality and 
of its special phases. Let us then turn for a moment to the 
consideration of this presentative complexity in itself. 
Sec. 11. All presentations of reflection are as we have

  278 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
seen of a highly complex nature, corresponding with complex 
emphases within the neururgic system. This complexity is 
partly due to the fact that the neururgic system is acted 
upon by a variety ot stimuli at the same time: but clearly 
it is principally due to the fact that this neururgic system is 
acted upon by a variety of stimuli in successive moments, 
the effects of one moment’s stimulations still persisting as 
minor neururgic emphases, in moments when new stimula- 
tions are giving rise to other and new neururgic emphases. 
A specially important mode of this neururgic complexity 
is given in the fact that the human animal lives in an 
environment of never ceasing change, in which there is a 
constant alteration of the position of the sources of stimula- 
tion in relation to the human body, either through the 
movement of these sources of stimulation in relation to the 
man, or through the man’s own movements in relation to 
his surroundings ; these changes of relative position involving 
great diversity in the power and nature of the stimuli which 
reach the man’s body. Countless sources of stimulation are 
thus always coming nearer to him and thus becoming more 
effective to produce minor neururgic emphases within the 
whole major emphases; and countless other sources of 
stimulation are always being separated from him and thus 
becoming less effective to produce these minor neururgic 
emphases. 
It is clear then that if the neururgic patterns in man 
are considered as wholes they must display constantly 
varying modes of complexity which are determined by the 
fact that the important sources of stimulation are either 
coming nearer to him; or are approximately stationary 
in relation to him; or are becoming separated from him. 
That is to say, if we view successive neururgic patterns 
in comparison, they clearly must display; either 1st, a 
developing complexity due to the man’s approach to 
effective sources of stimulation, or to their approach to 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
    THE TIME QUALITY 279 
him; or else 2nd, a stationary condition of complexity 
due to his retention for the moment of a fixed relation 
to these effective sources of stimulation; or else 3rd, a 
simplifying complexity due to his departure from the effec- 
tive sources of stimulation, or to their departure from him. 
It seems clear also that these characteristics of relative 
complexity which are so important to the inception of 
activities in the nervous system must also, in consequence 
of the retentiveness displayed by neururgic systems, be 
displayed in all forms of successive neururgic patterns if 
they are viewed in comparison: so that if we thus view 
successive neururgic patterns we must in all cases find 
their emphases displaying what we may call a characteristic, 
involving (1) either a developing complexity, or (2) a 
stationary complexity, or (3) a simplifying complexity. 
It furthermore appears that any two successive neururgic 
patterns, if taken as wholes, when viewed in comparison 
must frequently display very distinctly one of these phases 
of this characteristic; and that they cannot in any given 
moment display more than one of them thus distinctly. 
If the relation here referred to is noted at all, the successive 
neururgic patterns must display either a developing, or a 
stationary, or a simplifying complexity; and they cannot 
display very markedly one of the three without the 
preclusion of the appearance of the other two. 
This characteristic given to primary neururgic patterns 
originally by the form of environmental stimuli will 
evidently be maintained in all reverberations of these 
primary complex reactions. We must thus have given a 
characteristic of all neururgic patterns which will involve 
a norm of transition, as it were, and departures in one 
of two opposite directions from this norm: and we note 
that this norm will be brought into greatest prominence 
when the man is effectively stimulated by objects which are 
stationary in relation to him; while the departures from 
   
-P-A-G-E-294
  280 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL. 
this norm will be brought into greatest prominence when the 
man is effectively stimulated respectively by objects coming 
towards him, and by objects which are moving from him. 
Sec. 12. If the hypothesis of a thoroughgoing neururgic 
and noetic correspondence is true we surely should expect 
to find in consciousness some general characteristic or 
quality of presentations corresponding with this three-phased 
characteristic of neururgic emphases. We should expect 
to find in all presentations as viewed in retrospect a 
quality dependent upon their developing, or stationary, or 
simplifying complexity; a quality of such a nature that 
(1) one of the three forms above referred to must appear 
in relation to each complex presentation if considered in 
reflection; (2) that, under the proper conditions, any one 
of the three forms may appear; and (3) that the emphasis 
of one form must necessarily preclude the emphasis of 
either of the other two, if the field of presentations is 
considered as a whole. 
Moreover if such a general quality of presentations exists, 
we clearly might expect to find ourselves picturing it to 
ourselves in terms of our spatial conceptions; for although 
if looked for it would be always observable, it would 
correspond in its most emphatic forms with our movements 
in relation to objects in space, or with their movements in 
relation to us, these spatial objects being so far the most 
effective sources of emphatic presentations that we always 
tend to describe our experience in spatial terms. 
If then we ask ourselves whether we note in reflection 
any general quality of presentations of a three-phased nature 
which we habitually describe in terms which have special 
relation with objects coming to us, or with those stationary 
in relation to us, or with those going from us; we at 
once agree that we do observe such a general quality in 
what may be called the Time Quality, which must always 
appear either in the form of pastness, or presentness, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE TIME QUALITY 281 
futureness; and which as we have seen is most commonly 
described in spatial terms:—pastness being thought of 
always as involving something going from us; presentness 
as involving something with us; futureness as involving 
something coming towards us. 
Sec. 13. It may possibly appear to some reader that this 
theory might be put to a crucial test by producing, by 
mechanical means, increases and decreases of presentational 
complexity, and observing whether or not the appreciation 
of futureness and of pastness respectively are noticeable in 
reflecting upon the presentations thus given: and it might 
be claimed that such changes of perceptual complexity do 
not self-evidently involve such distinct recognition of what 
we might expect to be their appropriate time phases. It is 
to be noted however that such conditions of experiment 
as we here refer to would give rise to attention to perceptual 
presentations, due to objects before us, which we have 
become accustomed by an immense body of experience to 
identify with the “now-here” from which futureness and 
pastness are excluded. Furthermore there is ground for 
holding that the variations in complexity with which future- 
ness and pastness are identified are mainly those in the 
realm of secondary presentations which do not include 
the primary presentations of perception such as are involved 
in the cases of the supposed experiment of mechanically 
induced increases and decreases of complexity. 
Nevertheless it is to be remarked that artificially 
produced increases and decreases of the complexity of 
stimulations from objects in fixed relation to us do often 
give us respectively a sense of coming to us, and going 
from us: note for instance the effects of musical crescendos 
and decrescendos, and of growing and waning intensities of 
fixed lights. And as we have seen the coming to us aspect 
of presentations is closely related to futureness, while their 
going from us aspect is closely related to pastness.

Sec. 14. Let us now attempt to symbolize in formulae 
the nature of typical presentations in general, and of those 
special presentations in which the time relations become 
explicit, to see whether the conception of the relation of 
the time phases to presentative complexity is corroborated 
by their comparison. 
A 
As we have seen in an earlier chapter’ the simplest 
conceivable neururgic emphasis in the adult man is given 
if one supposes himself aroused from a deep slumber, say 
by a crash of thunder or by a glare of light. The deep 
slumber involves as close an approximation as is possible 
for the adult man to a dead calm on the neururgic wave 
surface which we have used as a simile; and upon this 
relatively calm surface appears suddenly a high wave. 
This high and practically isolated wave on the neururgic 
surface involves a marked noetic emphasis or presentation 
within consciousness; and this, as we have seen, may be 
represented by the symbol?

2 For the convenience of the reader I would remind him that the large 
P’s symbolize any primary presentations or impressions; the small 9’s 
symbolizing the corresponding secondary presentations, or so called 
“representations” or images. The Greek letters over the P’s and #’s 
indicate that the presentation of any moment differs from what we 
call the same presentation of the previous moment, in that the noetic 
pattern of each moment is affected by the fact that previous noetic 
patterns have existed. The numbers indicate the minor emphases within 
the total emphasis P, the marks between the numbers indicating relations 
of any nature which may happen to exist between these minor 
emphases. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE TIME QUALITY 283 
For as the reader will recall we have seen reason to believe 
that each primary presentation or impression (B1~2-3°4,5°6 
in the above symbol) has bound up with it what would be 
a secondary presentation (p-2-3°4,5%6 in the above symbol) 
if the direct action upon us from the environment were 
lacking. He will also recall that the psychic system tends 
to absorb, as it were, the noetic emphases or presentations 
which accrue to it, this resulting in the gradual disappearance 
as partial presentations from moment to moment of the less 
marked minor emphases in any given complex presentation, 
until finally it as a whole disappears as a presentation. 
This leads us to symbolize any special presentation in three 
successive moments, two of which follow an impression in 
moment (1) which is lacking in moments (2) and (3), by the 
symbol

the three successive moments, then the presentations of the 
three moments, as we have already seen, may be symbolized 
as follows :

If now a total darkness ensues in moment (4); and 
if in this moment we reflect upon the presentation (3) as 
a whole, and discern in it some special character, we may 
symbolize the presentation of moment (4) as follows :

Formula (3) as representing the simplest possible state 
of adult experience has already been given in Section 17 
of Chapter V., and as we there saw may be looked upon 
as typical of all presentations. It will be noted that it involves 
a simplification of complexity in the several minor emphases, 
Y 
As py and p. Sec. 15. Now all sorts of presentations occur which 
have all sorts of emphatic forms: and it is not difficult 
to show that if we use similar symbols the form of the 
presentation of reflection upon a state occasioned by a 
powerfully stimulative object which is moving from us is 
one in which the typical form of all presentations given 
in (3) above is very much emphasized. For if a power- 
fully stimulative object is moving from us the effect of 
this separation from the object must be to obliterate from 
moment to moment the efficiency of certain of the elements 
of the stimulus coming to us from the object, and corre- 
spondingly certain partial presentations within the complex 
presentation must disappear from moment to moment. 
That is to say the simplification of complexity observable 
in a// presentations of reflection, as typified in formula (3), 
will be greatly emphasized when we perceive objects 
which are moving from us, or from which we are 
moving. 
If we assume that the flash of light by which the man

is awakened from deep sleep is moving rapidly away from 
him ; the presentations of three successive moments may

except that in the latter case (4a) the simplification of 
complexity appears as greatly emphasized in relation to 
any revival of the original presentation 
Pl-2-3°4,5%6 
pl-2-3°4,5°6 
Sec. 16. What this means then is that a form deter- 
mined by simplification of complexity is given in a// pre- 
sentations ; which form is given very emphatically whenever 
we experience those special presentations due to objects 
which are being separated from us: and we thus see that 
it is most natural for us to describe this general charac- 
teristic of all presentations in terms used to describe the 
emphatic form of presentations due to our perception of 
objects moving from us. We may therefore quite naturally 
describe this general characteristic of all our presentations 
as viewed in reflection by saying that they always have a 
“going from us” aspect. 
But as we have already noted, we do experience empha- 
tically very frequently a form in presentations which we 
commonly describe as giving to them this “going from us” 
aspect: viz. the temporal form which leads us to speak 
of the presentation in connection with which it appears as 
related to the past. It would thus appear that the 
temporal form which we designate as pastness is one 
given as, or in indissoluble relation with, the simplifi- 
cation of complexity in the whole complex presentation of 
reflection. 
It would appear also that this characteristic of simplifica- 
tion of complexity, which we recognize as pastness, is given 
in connection with all of our presentations within conscious- 
ness as viewed in reflection, although it is given more 
emphatically in connection with presentations which involve 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
    
THE TIME QUALITY 287 
the distinct recognition of pastness. In other words the 
characteristic which when emphatic we speak of as the 
going from us aspect,—the pastness quality,—of presenta- 
tions is in fact of the very essence of the nature of all 
complex presentations given in reflection. (See formula (3), 
Sec. 14 above.) It is this fact that leads us to refer to 
the presentative field in general in spatial terms as a stream 
ever flowing from us. 
We are thus able also to account for the important 
fact, which we describe also in spatial terms, when we 
say that the time series has a movement in one irrever- 
sible direction ; a fact which we have seen must be taken 
account of in any adequate explanation of the nature of 
the time quality. For evidently if all reflection upon 
successive presentations involves an appreciation of a simpli- 
fication of complexity of successive presentations, then when 
our thought is turned to this aspect of presentations it 
must be recognized as describable in terms of a stream ever 
flowing in a given direction ; for the perception of such a 
stream necessarily involves an emphasis of this simplifica- 
tion of complexity within the given presentations. 
Sec. 17. We thus see clearly also the ground in experi- 
ence for the distinction between the “now” and _ the 
“specious present” of which we have above spoken. As 
all presentations as viewed in reflection involve a simplifica- 
tion of complexity as indicated in our typical formula (3) 
above, so must that special type of presentation which is 
conceived of as existing in the present moment, the nature 
of which we shall presently consider. In contrast with 
those presentations in which this simplifying complexity is 
much emphasized, in which therefore marked pastness is 
displayed, this so called present stands out as unique, and 
is spoken of as the “present.” But careful observation 
shows us the existence of this moving-from-us aspect even 
in connection with “ present” presentations, and under close    
-P-A-G-E-302
288 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL. 
scrutiny we find the present of reflection in reality qualified 
with pastness as all other reflective presentations are, and 
see that it is in reality a “just gone,” and is not the now 
but a “specious present.” 
Sec. 18. Those of my readers who have followed our 
thought in Chapter V., in which we have considered the 
nature of what we usually speak of as “representations,” 
will also now see clearly why it is that such ‘ representa- 
tions” must always display an emphasis of this general 
quality of all presentations, and must always be distinctly 
pervaded by the pastness phase of the time quality. 
B    
  Sec. 19. As we have just seen, on top as it were of | 
this ever moving stream of consciousness, in which past- 
ness is always given, there may appear many minor psychic 
emphases in various relations; and when these happen to 
take the form which is emphatically given when distinct 
objects in space are becoming separated from us this sense 
of pastness is very much strengthened. 
But these psychic emphases in their relations may also 
happen to take a form which is markedly given when 
distinct objects in space are moving toward us, or we 
towards them; and then we would be likely to describe 
this form as involving a “coming to us” aspect, In such 
cases the presentations of three successive moments may 
be symbolized as per the formulae below; for it must be 
assumed that with the approach of the object to us new 
forms of partial stimulation become effective to produce 
new partial psychic emphases in the complex presentation 
of the moment.   Pl-2-3°4,5%6

Here the newly accruing partial psychic emphases are 
indicated by the addition of ,7 in (6), and of .7 and *8 
in (7). These formulae (5, 6, 7) may then be taken to repre- 
sent the emphatic form involved in the presentations of 
reflection whenever we perceive objects approaching us ; 
and this may be described as the “coming to us” aspect 
of the perceptual presentation. But as we have already 
noted we find that we always attribute this “‘coming to 
us” aspect to the temporal phase of presentations which 
we describe as their futureness; and we may therefore 
assume that futureness is determined by the existence of 
this form in the presentation whether it is perceptual or not. 
If then we reflect upon this state (7) as a whole, (if 
we put this in a form related to the serial arrangement 
of the occurrence,) we have

The formula (8) then, as a whole, may be taken to 
represent presentations in which the coming to us time 
phase, i.e. futureness, is emphatic.’ 
1 Of the special form given to presentations where futureness is marked by 
the action of the empirical ego and the Self, we speak later. For as Jas. Ward 
truly says (Encyclopedia Britannica Article, p. 64) “An event expected differs 
from a like event remembered chiefly in two ways, in its relation to present 
impressions and images, and in the active attitude to which it leads.” 
7 
   
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
  But if we examine this formula (8) we note that it 
involves in a marked form a developing complexity. This 
becomes clear by placing the comparable parts of the 
formulae (42) and (8) in conjunction. 
(42) Simplification of Complexity : 
pl 2-3, plus pt-2, plus p!,—Pastness. 
(8) Development of Complexity : 
pl 2-3, plus p!~2-3°4.5, plus pt ~2-3°4,5"6.7,—Futureness. 
It would thus appear that the temporal form which we 
designate as futureness is one given in, or in indissoluble 
relation with, the development of complexity in the whole 
complex presentation of reflection. This seems the more 
probable because the temporal phase which we speak of as 
futureness has a characteristic which has been aptly described 
by Dr. James as “budding.” And a still stronger corro- 
boration of this view is given in the fact that futureness is 
always thought of as diametrically opposed to pastness ; and 
as we have seen above the pastness temporal phase seems 
to be related to a simplification of complexity, which is 
diametrically opposed to the development of complexity 
which we here suggest as the form to which our appreciation 
of futureness is due. 
c 
Sec.20. We have thus attempted to explain the appreciation 
of pastness and of futureness as being due to a recognition 
respectively of the simplification of, and of the development 
of, complexity in successive presentations. If this explana- 
tion is in any respect adequate, it is easy to see that a special 
characteristic will be given to any presentations in which 
both the marked simplification and the marked development 
of complexity are lacking, and in which a relatively unchang- 
ing complexity is maintained. Inasmuch as all presentations
-P-A-G-E-305
  THE TIME QUALITY 291 
of necessity involve forms displaying simplification of com- 
plexity, an appearance of unchanging complexity can only be 
given by artificial means, so to speak, such as are given by 
continuous emphatic stimulations reaching us in connection 
with unchanging objects in fixed spatial relation with our 
bodies. Now just such conditions give us our appreciation 
of emphatic presentness in connection with emphatic sensa- 
tional presentations and perceptual experiences of outer 
world objects, and lead us to describe the presentness 
qualification of our presentations as the “now-here”’ aspect. 
Our experience of these presentations therefore accords well 
with our theory. 
As we have already seen, all presentations as viewed in 
reflection are really qualified by a measure of pastness : and 
this is true then even of those presentations which are 
emphatically qualified by presentness. It is thus easy to 
comprehend how it happens that in viewing presentations as 
a whole we note that the presentations displaying presentness 
—i.e. what we call present,—are in reality just gone in 
relation to the “now” of experience ; how it happens that 
we come to see that this present is not what we mean when 
we speak of the “now,” but what Clay has called a 
“« specious present.” 
The true present is a mere passing point between pastness 
and futureness, a position of transition in the time stream 
from what is coming to us and what is going from us. It is 
not given as such in reflection where we catch only the “just 
gone” pastness. It thus corresponds closely with what we 
call “indifference” in the algedonic realm, which as we have 
seen is a transitional situation between pleasure and pain. 
Sec. 21. In the complex presentations of any moment of 
reflection there must always exist a present, this as we have 
seen being for the most part determined by the momentarily 
existing environmental stimulations. This ever existing 
elusive presentness serves as a norm as it were, with the
-P-A-G-E-306
  292 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
ideal construction of which we in reflection compare the 
time quality of any particular partial psychic emphasis within 
the whole complex emphasis which gives character to the 
noetic pattern of the moment. As Bradley* well says: 
“We are aware of and think of the past as past always by 
an ideal construction from the present, and the immediate 
presentation of the past as such would be a gratuitous 
miracle.”’ The same may be said of our conception of the 
future. 
The general time quality as viewed in the presentations of 
reflection must always show the passing away or pastness 
phase, which must appear as such in contrast with this 
“specious present” of the moment’s unchanging com- 
plexity : for apart from the existence of such a present of 
relatively unchanging complexity we could not apprehend 
by comparison the cessations which pastness involves,—the 
simplification of the complexity in parts of the complex 
presentation. 
But in connection with all of our complex presentations 
there is always also some measure of “budding,’—of 
futureness. This futureness when apprehended also appears 
as such in contrast with the “specious present” of the 
moment’s unchanging complexity; for again apart from 
the existence of such a present of relatively unchanging 
complexity we could not apprehend by comparison the 
“budding,” which futureness involves,—the development of 
the complexity in parts of the complex presentation. 
But if this is true it is also true, on the other hand, that 
this presentness itself appears as such only by contrast. As 
James Ward well says,’ ‘The present alone, and life as a 
succession of presents, or in other words continuous occupa- 
tion with impressions, give us no knowledge of the present 
as present. This we first obtain when our present con- 
sciousness consists partly of memories or partly of expecta-

  THE TIME QUALITY 293 
tions (states in which pastness @: futureness respectively are 
preeminent, H. R. M.) as well.” 
Sec. 22. This “specious present” is thus as it were a 
mere place of transition in the stream, where the futureness 
phase passes over into the pastness phase, where the com- 
plexity appears as neither developing not simplifying. It is 
true that this “specious present” is never clearly apprehended 
as a line of transition ; and so it is true, as Prof. James says, 
that we apprehend the “present” not as a knife edge but 
rather as a saddle back with “fringes,”—i.e. not clearly 
apprehended parts,—spreading out on the one hand into the 
futureness and on the other hand into the pastness. 
This is especially interesting as it shows the close relation 
between the algedonic and the time qualities, in the fact that 
the algedonic xorm, viz. indifference, like the temporal norm, 
viz. presentness, displays this more or less of indefiniteness, 
so that indifference too may be described better as a saddle 
back than as a knife edge, for as we have seen much that we 
speak of as indifference is tinged with what we may also call 
a pleasure fringe and a pain fringe. 
vI 
Sec. 23. From our study in the preceding division of this 
chapter it would appear that the recognition of the time 
phases is due to the relative complexity of successive pre- 
sentations as this is appreciated in a complex presentation 
of reflection which embodies the relation between these 
successive presentations. Or if this seems to be going too 
far it may at least be well claimed that these time phases are 
determined by some characteristic of such reflective pre- 
sentations which varies, practically, directly with variations 
of this complexity. If this is the case then certainly the 
time phases must be phases of a general quality of all 
presentations, and it will be worth our while in closing this
-P-A-G-E-308
294 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
chapter to pass in review the characteristics of these temporal 
phases in order to see how far it is possible to account for 
them under this psychological hypothesis. 
Sec. 24. The Time Quality then appears to be a general 
quality of all presentations as viewed in reflection.’ Each 
specific presentation must display either marked pastness, or 
presentness, or futureness ; and under the proper conditions 
it may display either of the three; but if it displays a 
marked pastness it cannot in itself display marked present- 
ness or futureness, if it displays a marked presentness it 
cannot in itself display marked pastness or futureness, and 
if it displays a marked futureness it cannot in itself display 
marked pastness or presentness. 
In order to avoid misconstruction of the above statement 
it must at once be noted that we have thus spoken of 
specific emphases or presentations as given in experience. 
It has been stated as an objection to my theoretical position 
that it is quite possible to apprehend certain conceptions as 
timeless : such for instance as God or virtue. But in such 
cases we are dealing with complex concepts of which part of 
the connotation is timelessness ; which timelessness is itself 
of a conceptual nature. Such a criticism therefore altogether 
fails of its mark; for all that is claimed here is that all 
presentations, of which the timeless concept is a special case, 
are themselves, as experienced presentations, necessarily quali- 
fied in such a way that we are always able to place them 
either in the past, or in the present, or in the future. 
Sec. 25. The fact that we here speak of specific presenta- 
tions must not be overlooked in another connection. In 
ordinary experience our psychic emphases display complexes 
of minor emphases within the major emphasis ; the field of 
presentation taken as a whole is always a complex of more 
or less clearly differentiated minor presentational parts, each 
1Cf, Miinsterberg, Grundzuge d. Psychohgie, pp. 320-330; whose argu- 
ment appears implicitly to involve the position here maintained. 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
THE TIME QUALITY 295 
of which so far as differentiable has its specific character. 
Hence we might expect, when we consider experience as a 
whole in reflection, to find that it always displays some 
pastness, some presentness, some futureness ; one of the 
three phases being usually more emphatic than the others 
as one of the partial presentations in the whole complex is 
more emphatic than the others. It is this experience which 
leads us as we have seen to describe experience as a whole as 
a “stream,” in part ever flowing toward us, in part being 
with us, in part flowing away from us. 
At the same time we can scarcely expect to find any 
moment of experience in which one of the three phases, 
either the pastness, or the presentness, or the futureness, is 
not markedly predominant. 
(4) When the most emphatic part of the noetic pattern 
under consideration displays marked futureness we speak of 
the whole presentation as relating to the future, although in 
it as a whole exists something of presentness and of pastness. 
When for instance I think of the next President of the 
United States, in the presentation as a whole there is an 
emphasis of futureness: and yet there is not lost a sense of 
presentness, not only in the fact of the appearance of a new 
partial emphasis arising in correspondence with the moment’s 
environmental stimuli, but also in the fact that there exists 
dimly the minor partial presentation ‘“‘a President now 
existing” : nor is there lost a sense of pastness, in the vague 
cognizance of the nature of Presidents as they have existed 
for over 100 years. In such a case, however, this present- 
ness and pastness are all in the background, and we think of 
our next President as in the future; the presentation or 
noetic emphasis as a whole has marked futureness. 
(8) When the most marked part of the noetic pattern 
under consideration is that part which displays distinct pre- 
sentness we speak of the whole presentation as “the present.” 
And in a vastly large proportion of the moments of life this
-P-A-G-E-310
  296 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
is the experience which is emphatic; and this because the 
influences of environmental stimuli are so usually forceful 
and persistent. The page which you now read has this 
presentness for you: but within the complex presentation of 
this moment a minor emphasis of what you have just read 
is passing away, as we say in our spatial terms; i.e. this 
minor emphasis has the quality of pastness, it is fading off 
into what Dr. James calls the “backward fringe.” At the 
same time the end of the sentence that I am beginning is 
“budding” as a minor presentation, as a minor emphasis 
within the whole noetic pattern of the moment ; and so far 
as it is presented at all it has the quality of futureness ; this 
is what Dr. James calls the “ forward fringe.” 
(C) When the most emphatic part of the noetic pattern 
under consideration is that part which displays marked 
pastness we speak of the whole presentation as relating to 
the past. When you think of the first words of this chapter 
pastness is emphasized ; nevertheless you cannot rid yourself 
of the less emphasized presentness of the minor presentations 
corresponding with the moment’s effects of environmental 
stimuli; nor can you rid yourself of the more or less dim 
futureness, or ‘‘ budding,” which goes with each moment of 
existence. 
Sec. 26. While there is thus something of pastness, and 
of presentness, and of futureness, in connection with all 
presentations ; nevertheless, as we have already said, a 
marked degree of emphasis of one of the three phases of 
the time quality in connection with a definite emphatic 
minor presentation precludes the emphasis of the other 
phases. The thought of my grandmother is so distinctly 
of the past that the presentness and futureness of the total 
complex presentation of the moment disappear by com- 
parison. The pressure on my tired hand as I write is so 
distinctly of the present that the pastness and futureness of 
the total complex presentation disappear by comparison. 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE TIME QUALITY 297 
The thought of our next President is so distinctly of the 
future that the presentness and the pastness of the total 
complex presentation disappear by comparison. 
Sec. 27. While it is true in general that where a 
presentation is distinctly qualified by one temporal phase 
the existence of the other two temporal phases in connection 
with it is overlooked; nevertheless our presentations are 
so complex that they are, as we have seen, often more or 
less clearly separated into minor psychic systems, and thus 
we not infrequently find various phases of the time quality 
sufficiently marked to be noted at one and the same time 
in connrction with slight changes in the nature of a given 
preser.ation. 
*. presentation of practically the same nature may be 
roted in reflection as belonging in the past, the present, 
and the future: for example we may note our conception 
of the processes of evolution in the physical world, which 
we conceive of as having governed in the past, and as 
being exhibited in the present, and as to continue in the 
future. 
We may note a similar presentation as in the past, 
and in the present, to the exclusion of the future: as for 
example when we revisit some haunt of our childhood 
which we realize we cannot again see in the course of 
our lives. We may note a similar presentation as in the 
present and in the future, to the exclusion of the past; 
as when one receives an increase of income through the 
unexpected increase of his salary. We may note a similar 
presentation as in the past and in the future to the exclusion 
of the present: as when, engaged in business, one thinks 
of his games of golf as played yesterday and to be played 
tomorrow. 
Sec. 28. The ordinary flow of thought involves, as 
we know, an absence of sensational emphasis with which, 
as we have seen, the sense of presentness is especially 
   
-P-A-G-E-312
    298 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IL 
connected. We should therefore expect to find, as we do, 
that when we look at the field of presentations as a whole 
we especially experience the play of pastness, and of 
futureness, in relation to our thought trains. Not that 
presentness is excluded; rather that the occurrence of 
futureness and presentness and pastness are more equally 
observed by us in the region of the free flow of thought 
than elsewhere: and that futureness and pastness are 
especially noteworthy in this region of thought because in 
other regions presentness is wont to be so emphatic. 
Sec. 29. In certain cases a given presentation of the 
past, when viewed in the reflective presentation of the 
moment, may have a characteristic pastness quite apart 
from the mere 'pastness involved in the time flow of the 
moment; this being due to its firm connections with all 
that vast field of secondary presentations that are bound 
by indissoluble bonds to those secondary presentations in 
which the past-time form is emphasized. I have for 
instance the presentation “my great-great-grandfather.” 
This man is thought of as in the past without any question: 
yet I have had no experience of that great-great-grandfather 
to account for the pastness of the presentation similar to 
that which enables us to account for the pastness of the 
thought of an event of yesterday, or of last week, which we 
describe as being due to the holding in mind of a train 
of secondary presentations in which we can see that 
decreasing complexity must be a marked characteristic. 
It is easy to see that a vast field of secondary presentations 
must necessarily be attached by inherent bonds to the lately 
experienced past. This vast field so far as its time quality 
is emphasized in attention becomes for us she Past as a 
special presentation. Whenever any secondary presentation 
due to a thought process which is only indirectly the result 
of experience, is found to be indissolubly attached to this 
vast field which we call she Past, then although it may not
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE TIME QUALITY 299 
have in itself the emphatic marks of pastness it nevertheless 
is identified with the Past. The truth of this view becomes 
clear when we consider the case just referred to. The 
idea of my father is distinctly part of the experience of 
my life in which the quality of pastness is emphatic: the 
idea of my grandfather who died in my childhood is only 
to a very small degree part of that experience: but the 
idea of my great-great-grandfather, while having in itself 
no other pastness than that inherent in the time flow of 
the momentary presentation, gains its distinct pastness by 
its inherent attachment to the body of experience in 
which the quality of pastness is emphasized in reflective 
attention. 
In fact if we note our experience with care we find that 
an indefinitely small part of the presentations which we 
call past have any thing more to warrant this qualification 
than this attachment to the inextricably complex web which 
spreads away from those late experiences, which give us 
the presentations of the /ate past, in which the form of 
pastness is emphasized. Even the thought of my father, 
who died not so many years ago, is I find in no small 
part merely past in the same sense in which the thought 
of his great-grandfather is. 
Sec. 30. In a similar manner a given presentation, 
when viewed in the reflective presentation of the moment, 
may have a characteristic futureness quite apart from the 
mere futureness involved in the time flow of the moment; 
this being due to its firm connection with all of the field 
of secondary presentations which are bound by indissoluble 
bonds with those secondary presentations in which the 
future-time form is emphasized. I think for instance of 
my grandchildren as in the future, and here the develop- 
ment of the presentation which relates to what is entirely 
within the possibilities of experience gives without doubt 
an inherent futureness to the presentation. But when I 
   
-P-A-G-E-314
  300 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP II. 
think of my great-great-grandchildren I think of them 
equally as distinctly in future time: yet no possible 
experience to be mine can account for the distinct future- 
ness of this presentation. 
It is clear, indeed, in a manner similar to that noted 
in relation to pastness, that a broad field of secondary 
presentations must attach to the field in which true 
futureness is emphasized. This field so far as its time 
quality is emphasized in attention becomes for us the 
Future, as a special presentation. ‘This field is appreciably 
narrower than the field of the Past: and, as we shall see 
in a later chapter where we consider the nature of 
expectation, the width of this field of the Future would be 
indefinitely smaller than it is were it not for processes 
connected with, and developed out of, past experience. 
Whenever any idea is found to be indissolubly attached 
to this field which we call she Future, then, although it may 
not have in itself the emphatic marks of futureness, it 
nevertheless is identified with the Future. The idea of my 
grandchildren certainly has some considerable amount of 
futureness inherently attached to it: but the idea of my 
great-great-grandchildren can have but little of this inherent 
futureness, although it is distinctly placed in the Future, and 
that by the process above described. It gains its distinct 
futureness by its attachment to the body of experience in 
which the quality of futureness is emphasized in reflective 
attention. In fact only an indefinitely small part of the 
presentations which we think of as in the future have any- 
thing more to warrant this qualification than this attachment 
to the inextricably complex web which is connected with 
those experiences in which futureness is distinctly em- 
phasized. 
Sec. 31. As we have seen, when a presentness is noted it 
stands always in relation to a futureness or a pastness. In 
describing it we might well say “this is a not past,” or “this 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
THE TIME QUALITY 301 
is a not future,” “it is the actual present.” And here we 
have no possibility of the attainment of any such indirect 
process of attachment as is observable with pastness and 
futureness. The Past is a stream of indefinite dimensions : 
the Future appears also as a stream, although its extent is 
less than that of the Past. The Present (the “specious 
present””) however is but the cross section of this stream, 
and as such stands in distinct contrast in this respect with 
the Past and with the Future. 
Sec. 32. It seems clear that the form of the presentations 
within consciousness is determined by the reverberant nature 
of the coincident activities of complex neural systems, in 
connection with the processes which we speak of as physical 
and psychic assimilation. I have sought in this chapter to 
show that under these conditions these factors, which are 
always implicated in each moment of consciousness, them- 
selves involve the experience of the time flow ; and that this 
must appear either as pastness, or futureness, or as a some- 
what which is a transition between the two, which we call 
presentness. 
Even if it is shown that the suggested relation of the time 
phases to presentational complexity is unwarranted, never- 
theless I think the facts brought out in the course of our 
study have shown conclusively that Timeness is a general 
quality of all presentations, of a three-phased nature ; that 
in reflection at least one of these three phases (pastness, 
presentness, or futureness) must usually be predominant ; 
and that if any one of these three phases becomes pre- 
dominant as a qualification of any given presentation, this 
fact necessarily excludes the prominence of either of the 
other two in connection with the same presentation. 
1 The explanation of the time flow in terms of complexity in what has 
preceded this leaves untouched a problem of importance which the reader 
may expect to find treated in this connection. Presentations which come 
to us in the form of what we call events give us not only the experience of
-P-A-G-E-316
  302 GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP IIL. 
Sec. 33. It may well be noted here that if this view is 
correct the time quality, and the spatial quality, which we 
consider in Appendix A (Sec. 21 ff.), are not on the same 
psychological plane, if we may so speak. The time quality 
is a general quality of all presentations, while the spatial 
quality, although attaching to a vast number of our pre- 
sentations, does not attach to all of them. Space and Time 
would thus appear to be categories of diverse orders, and 
not so closely related as certain of our modern thinkers are 
wont to claim or imply. 
Sec. 34. The efficiency of the unemphasized undiffer- 
entiable psychic system upon the presentations which yield 
our appreciation of the diverse time phases must not be 
overlooked ; but as it will be necessary to study this subject 
fully in a later chapter consideration of it will be deferred in 
order to avoid unnecessary repetition. 
the time flow, but when given to us in the “now” are referred to special 
positions in time: they are more or less definitely dated in the past or 
future, or else are distinctly recognized as present. All presentations as 
such may be looked upon as events in consciousness ; but, if they are con- 
sidered not as parts of the stream of consciousness, but in relation to other 
presentations, not all presentations are events. Such presentations for 
instance as those which give us our notion of general mechanical laws are 
not events. Persons are not events. It is clear therefore that the charac- 
teristics which constitute a presentation an event are not necessarily found 
in all presentations, and that it will therefore be out of place to consider 
them here where we are treating only of the general qualities which belong 
to all states of complex consciousness.

CORRELATION OF THE GENERAL QUALITIES 
STUDIED IN PART I 
DIVISION I. INTRODUCTION 
CHAPTER XIII 
THE GENERAL RELATIONS WITHIN GROUP I 
AND GROUP II 
Sec. 1. In Part 1. we have seen that Intensity, Mani- 
foldness, and Realness, in Group 1. ; the Algedonic Quality, 
and the Time Quality, in Group 1, are general qualities 
which must attach to each presentation observable in reflec- 
tion. If this is true then each presentation must display 
at the same time some measure of each of the qualities in 
Group 1., and some phase of each of the qualities in 
Group u., and special characteristics might be expected to 
be noted in connection with special presentations which 
display in marked form two or more of these qualities 
in conjunction. 
Before enquiring whether such distinctive characteristics 
are discerned we may well note the relations existing 
between the general qualities within Group 1., and those 
between the general qualities of Group um. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  304 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES IN PART I. 
I. Tue Retatrions BETWEEN THE GENERAL QUALITIES 
WITHIN Group I. 
A. Intensity and Manifoldness. 
Sec. 2. It is generally agreed, as we have seen, that a 
high degree of intensity in connection with a given presen- 
tation corresponds with a high degree of activity in some 
special limited part of the nervous system: while on the 
other hand a high degree of manifoldness in connection with 
a given presentation corresponds with a multiplicity of less 
emphatic degrees of activity in a larger number of parts of 
the nervous system, each one of which however is sufficiently 
high in degree to be noticeable in contrast with the activities 
of the mass of the nervous system taken as a whole. 
It appears clear that the prominence of a very marked 
degree of activity in one part of the nervous system ‘is 
necessarily incompatible with the prominence of a notable 
multiplicity of less emphatic activities in many parts ; and 
therefore we may say that the neururgic characteristic given 
when the emphasis of the moment is due to a very marked 
activity of a relatively narrow nervous part, must vary 
inversely with the neururgic characteristic given when the 
emphasis of the moment is due to the less marked activities 
of a multiplicity of nervous parts. 
Sec. 3. Evidently then we should expect to find Intensity 
and Manifoldness inversely related. The more intense the 
presentation of a given moment is, the less of manifoldness 
should it display: and vice versa the more of manifoldness 
displayed in connection with a given presentation the less 
intense should it appear: and clearly this expectation is met 
in our experience. 
In general we may note that the states of mind in which 
manifoldness is most prominent, e.g. the lazy, drowsy, just-
-P-A-G-E-319
  RELATIONS WITHIN GROUPS I. AND II. 305 
falling-asleep states, are those which give us no appreciation 
of intensity. And when we turn to particulars we note that 
those presentations which we describe as ‘‘ thoughts” in 
the main display high degrees of manifoldness, while they 
can seldom be said to display any marked points of intensity. 
So the emotions are in general notably manifold and at the 
same time lacking in intensity of detail. 
The consideration of the sensations shows us most clearly 
that those specific presentations in connection with which 
intensities are most frequently noted are the ones in connec- 
tion with which it is most difficult to discriminate manifold- 
ness. The loud, shrill, intense, whistle-sound appears to 
lack manifoldness ; while on the other hand the low rumble 
of thunder which seems manifold and voluminous appears 
to lack intensity of specific tones. With the twilight which 
seems broad and full we do not connect the notion of 
intensity: while the light sensation coming from some star 
in the heavens appearing punctual, i.e. lacking in manifold- 
ness, may seem to us to be very intense, although the amount 
of light reaching us from it is much less than that given in 
the twilight glow. 
B. Of Lntensity and Realness. 
Sec. 4. If the activity of a special nervous part is of 
high degree in any given moment the activity of this part 
will tend to become predominant in successive moments ; 
that is to say, this high degree will tend to give to the 
activity of this part a certain measure of stability in the de- 
velopment of the neururgic patterns of successive moments. 
A high degree of nervous activity in a part should therefore 
tend to vary directly with the stability of the emphatic 
activity within the neururgic pattern in which it inheres. 
But this high degree of neural activity on the one hand 
corresponds with intensity ; and on the other hand under 
u 
     
-P-A-G-E-320
  
  306 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES IN PART I. 
our view this neururgic stability corresponds with realness 
in connection with the given presentation. We should 
therefore expect to find that intensity and realness in con- 
nection with any given presentation are directly related :— 
i.e. that the more intense a given presentation is, the more 
of realness it will tend to display; and vice versa the less 
of intensity, the less of realness. 
Sec. 5. I think the'reader will agree with me that exactly 
this expected relation is found in our experience. As we 
shall presently see, a recognition of realness is involved with 
the mental attitude which we describe as belief: Hume ! is 
therefore referring to what I call the sense of realness when 
he speaks of the ‘‘ sentiment of belief.” When therefore 
he says ‘‘ the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conception 
more intense and steady than what attends the mere fictions 
of the imagination,” he is really saying in his own way 
that, according to his introspective observation, intensity 
goes hand in hand with ‘“‘ steadiness,’ or what I should 
speak of as stability or realness. 
If our view is correct we should expect to find realness 
appreciated most distinctly and completely in direct or in- 
direct connection with our sensational experiences in con- 
nection with which intensity is most marked. Thus it is 
that a loud sound, or a vivid flash of light, can scarcely be 
thought of as unreal. Beyond that the percepts closely 
related to our sensational experiences give us so constantly 
the sense of realness that there can be no doubt that Dr. 
James is right? in holding that the real world par excellence 
is the world of sensation-perception. 
On the other hand sensational ‘‘ dimness,” or lack of the 
intensity of sensations and sensation-percepts, is coupled in 
our minds with lack of realness. The mere flitting light 
on the mist is “ ghostly” and unreal ; the dim shadow of 
1 Human Understanding, sec. v. part ii. 
2 Confer op. cit. ii. pp. 299 to 306.
-P-A-G-E-321
| RELATIONS WITHIN GROUPS I. AND II. 307 
the man is unreal in comparison with the more intense 
sensation-percept of the form of the man himself. 
As we have seen, what we call the “vividness” of a 
thought or concept must be looked upon as a form of 
intensity. So we are prepared to find that coupled with this 
vividness goes a tendency to the apprehension of realness. 
These flitting lights on the mist as such have no intensity, 
and are lacking in realness: but let them gain a meaning of 
importance in the conceptual world,—let them, for instance, 
arouse in the mind of the superstitious the notion “it is a 
ghost,’”—and at once the presentation gains vividness; and 
it acquires at the same time a realness which sends shivers 
down the back, and makes the man run for his life. For 
my readers and for me, even if the notion of the ghost arises 
in mind, it fails utterly to gain such vividness, and fails also 
of that realness which produces defensive reactions in every 
day life. It sends no shivers down our backs, and we have 
no tendency to crouch or to run. 
C. Of Realness and Manifoldness. 
Sec. 6. As we have seen above, Intensity and Manifold- 
ness tend to vary inversely, while Intensity and Realness 
tend to vary directly; of necessity therefore, if our view 
is correct, Realness and Manifoldness must tend to vary 
inversely: the more of realness which is attached to a given 
presentation the less of manifoldness will be attached to it: 
and vice versa, the less of realness the more of manifoldness. 
It seems clear that theoretically the existence of a marked 
stability of a given special presentation which yields realness 
is incompatible with the marked appreciation of the broad 
complexity of points of noetic emphasis which yields mani- 
foldness. And conversely that a great exaggeration of 
manifoldness will in general tend to result in a loss of the 
stability of any given special presentation: for each point 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
308 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES IN PART I. 
of emphasis becomes a possible point of appearance of a new 
form of noetic pattern: and each such possible noetic pattern 
may perchance be one which will displace the one existing 
when the new emphasis arises. It appears therefore, from 
this point of view also, that realness and manifoldness must 
be inversely related. 
And this we discover to be the case in our every day 
experience. Vagueness, dimness, lack of distinctness, failure 
in definiteness, are terms descriptive of marked manifoldness, 
i.e. of a marked complexity, rather than of simplicity, in the 
presentations to which these descriptive terms are applied: 
and vagueness, dimness, lack of distinctness and definiteness, 
are all connected in our minds with the sense of unrealness. 
That is, a full manifoldness is recognized as going hand in 
hand with failure of realness. 
On the other hand we are likely to describe the real as 
clear, distinct, definite; that is to say the presentation that 
has realness is lacking in manifoldness. The vivid, keen, 
“simple” sensations, the pain that is so lacking in manifold- 
ness that we speak of it as sharp and pointed, are experiences 
which seem to us pre-eminently real. It is the definite 
object,—this man before me,—that is real: his shadow, 
which is vague and shifting, that is unreal. 
Sec. 7. It thus appears that Intensity and Realness are 
directly related, and that they are both inversely related to 
Manifoldness. "When intensity is marked realness tends to 
be appreciated; and when realness is marked intensity is 
likely: to be appreciated. So again when manifoldness 
appears very marked intensity and realness are not likely to 
be noted; and when intensity and realness are marked mani- 
foldness is not likely to be distinct.

  RELATIONS WITHIN GROUPS I. AND II. 309 
Il. Tue ReLaTIOoNS BETWEEN THE GENERAL QUALITIES 
wiTHIN Group II. 
The Relation between the Algedonic and the Time Qualities. 
Sec. 8. Introspection shows us that presentations which 
are relegated to the past may be either pleasant, indifferent, 
or painful ; and that the same is true of those qualified by 
presentness, or futureness: i.e. there seems to be nothing 
in the nature of a time phase which carries with it a tendency 
to the existence of any special algedonic phase in connection 
with the presentation to which the special time phase is 
attached. Nor on the other hand does it appear that any 
special algedonic phase is identified with any special time 
phase: pleasures may be appreciated as past, as present, or 
as future ; and the same is true of pains. 
These observations accord well with our hypotheses as to 
the neururgic correspondents of the algedonic and of the 
time qualities. For according to our view the phases of the 
algedonic quality correspond with relations of efficiency in 
neural elements ; while the several time phases of presen- 
tations are due to the development, or fixity, or simplifica- 
tion, of complexity which must correspond with similar 
relations of neururgic complexity. Clearly differences in 
the grade of efficiency, which would involve modifications of 
algedonic phase, might exist without involving any definite 
development, or fixity, or simplification, of complexity in the 
presentation in which any special algedonic phase inheres ; 
and on the other hand specific changes of complexity would 
not necessarily involve definite phases of efficiency in the 
elemental parts of the neururgic pattern in relation to which 
the time phases are developed. 
Sec. 9. We are thus led to see that the relation between 
the Algedonic and the Time qualities is necessarily inde-

terminate. There is no special reason why an emphasis of 
any special algedonic phase should always be given with the 
emphasis of any special time phase, or why the emphasis of 
any special time phase should always be given with the 
emphasis of any special algedonic phase. 
The reader will note that we refer here particularly to the 
relation of the algedonic and the time qualities in specific 
presentations. That the algedonic quality of a given presen- 
tation has a definite relation to the development of sub- 
sequent noetic patterns, and the appearance of revivals, will 
become evident in the chapter in which we consider the 
relations of the algedonic quality of presentations to the 
movement of attention. 
III. Tue CorreraTion BETWEEN THE GENERAL QUALITIES 
or Groups I. anp II. 
Sec. 10. As within Group 1. the algedonic and time 
phases are indeterminately related, we should not expect any 
recurrence of marked special forms given to presentations 
in connection with the coincident appearance of specific alge- 
donic phases and specific time phases, sufficiently constant 
to lead us to appreciate them and give them special names. 
But on the other hand, as we have seen, the qualities 
within Group 1. are definitely related and we should expect to 
find cases, first where a marked intensity, and second where 
a marked realness, would be noted as related to an appreci- 
ated manifoldness of the broader presentative field. In such 
cases we should expect to discover the appearance in the 
presentative field of new combinational senses of relation 
due to the coincidence of the senses of relation which yield 
the appreciation of intensity, manifoldness, and realness. 
To a consideration of these combinational senses of relation 
we shall devote Division 11. to follow.
-P-A-G-E-325
  RELATIONS WITHIN GROUPS I. AND IL. 311 
Sec. 11. Turning to the broader correlation between the 
general qualities within both Groups 1. and m1. we perceive 
that if we have five general qualities each of which must 
appear in some phase in connection with each presentation 5 
then the manner in which emphatic experience of these 
phases of these general qualities are experienced together 
might be expected to give us more or less distinctly marked 
forms in our noetic patterns, which will be worthy of study. 
For instance, a presentation might be lacking in manifold- 
ness, and at the same time might have much of intensity, 
much of realness, and might on the whole be painful, and 
might display the time phase which we have called pastness. 
Or perchance it might display much of manifoldness, might 
lack intensity and realness, might be pleasant, and might 
display the time phase which we call futureness. If we are 
to carry out our method thoroughly we are surely called 
upon to examine all the forms given to presentations by the 
possible simultaneous combinations of the emphasis of the 
several phases of these five general qualities. 
This task, which at first glance may appear to be a for- 
midable one, seems much less so however when we consider 
the two conclusions already reached : first that within Group 
I., intensity and realness vary directly, and that both intensity 
and realness vary inversely in relation to manifoldness: 
second that in Group 11. the relation of the algedonic quality 
to the time quality is indeterminate. 
The first of these facts, involving the impossibility of the 
emphasis of either intensity or realness simultaneously with 
the emphasis of manifoldness, enables us in our consideration 
to group together manifoldness and intensity on the one 
hand, and manifoldness and realness on the other: while the 
second of these facts enables us to treat the algedonic and 
the time qualities separately in relation to the qualities of 
Group 1.

We are thus led to see that we may properly study our 
problems under the following Sub-Divisions :

to the qualities of Group I. 
A. The Algedonic quality in relation to Intensity-Mani-

I 
Sec. 1, ALTHouGH the appreciation of intensity in rela-_ 
tion to any specific presentation tends to exclude the 
appreciation of manifoldness in relation to the same presen- 
tation ; on the other hand if a distinct noetic pattern exists 
in any given moment, and is appreciated as such, it certainly 
must include a relatively narrow field of intensity and a 
relatively broad field of manifoldness in one and the same 
moment, and we might expect that the relation between 
these two fields, if considered in itself, might present some 
characteristics worthy of our study. It would appear that 
a new sense of relation must be developed by the correlation 
of the intensity sense of relation developed in connection 
with a special part of the noetic pattern, and the manifoldness 
sense of relation developed in connection with the presented 
broad noetic system apart from the intense part. 
If such a sense of relation exists we might expect to find 
it described in terms of that special form of presentation, 
very common and emphatic in our experience, which we 
know as the visual psychic field ; for in this field we have 
a very emphatic element of light sensation, spoken of as 
   
-P-A-G-E-328
  314. CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
within the focus, which stands over against and in contra- 
distinction from a wide visual field, a broad manifold of light 
sensations of very inferior distinctness. 
The reader will at once realize that we do use our experi- 
ence of the visual field to typify a very general aspect of 
consciousness which we speak of as Attention. It is a 
commonplace to describe the most emphatic psychic element 
as being in the focus of attention, implying in this very 
phrase the existence of a mass of minor presentations beyond 
this focus which we speak:iof as the field of attention: a 
field which, as we shall presently see, fades away in distinct- 
ness and definiteness into what I speak of as the field of 
inattention. 
We have then in what we may call attention-experience 
the appreciation of a combinational sense of relation due to 
the coincident effectiveness of the intensity and manifoldness 
senses of relation. As Mr. Shand? well says, we must hold 
“that Attention is as directly felt or experienced as sensa- 
tion, that it is presented, and not merely thought about or 
conceived ; that so far from being something outside the 
stream of events, it is an event or succession of events ; 
that so far from being pre-eminently active, if it be active, 
it is only so in the sense in which all other mental elements 
including sensations are active, which in submitting to 
change themselves modify the change they submit to, and 
in actively influencing the course of mental events are as 
certainly modified and conditioned by preceding and accom- 
panying events.” 
In what follows I shall usually use this term attention- 
experience where I refer to the subjective appreciation of 
attention, using the word attention alone in this sense only 
in the interest of brevity where the subjective implication 
is clear. In general where the mere word attention is used 
we are considering the matter before us quite objectively. 
1Mind, N.S. 12, p. 469.

  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 315 
It is worth while to note in passing that, in this habit of 
typifying the nature of the whole field of consciousness by 
describing it in terms of our experience of that especially 
prominent part of the field of presentations which we speak 
of as vision, we have a weighty corroboration of the validity 
of the conception of consciousness as a system of minor 
psychic systems in which the action of any minor system is 
the verisimilitude of the action of the complex system as a 
whole. For the visual nervous centres are clearly highly 
systematized as such, and yet constitute but a minor system 
within the whole brain system, which is the pre-eminently 
important part of the whole nervous system. As the.activi- 
ties within this visual minor system typify the activities of 
the nervous system as a whole, so in this natural habit of 
comparing the whole field of attention with our visual 
experience we implicitly acknowledge that our conscious 
experience as a whole is typified by our experience in this 
most prominent part of the field of presentations. 
Sec. 2. Titchener tells us’ that ‘the problem of atten- 
tion centers in the fact of sensible clearness” ; and? that 
“* clearness is an independent attribute of sensation ” which 
““ may vary independently of intensity ”; although ‘‘ change 
of clearness always involves a change of intensity as well.” 
One cannot but hesitate to question so positive a statement 
of so thoroughly equipped and thoughtful a psychologist ; 
and yet one is naturally led to note the limitation of his 
view as thus stated to sensational considerations, and to recall 
that a large part of our attention-experiences are within the 
realm of thought, and therefore in our view non-sensational. 
And when we consider the matter with care we are led to 
see that the facts upon which Titchener bases his statements 
above quoted may all be interpreted in terms of the shifting 
of attention. When we look upon the clearness of a sen- 
sation as distinct from its intensity we are considering the 
1 The Psychology of Feeling and Attention, p. 182. 2 Op. cit. p. 219.
-P-A-G-E-330
  316 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
relation of the sensation to a very different psychic field than 
that involved when we consider what we call the intensity 
of the sensation as such. 
In this connection I must ask the reader to refer back to 
my remarks as to the relation of vividness to intensity in 
Chapter virt. Sec. 4, and to note that clearness is but another 
name for vividness. I there argued that vividness was our 
name for intensity in fields of a broader nature than those 
in which the typical intensity, viz. sensational intensity, 
appears. When we consider clearness or vividness we are 
dealing with attention in a field of broader significance than 
when we consider intensity, in which latter case we deal with 
attention in a field of narrower significance. 
That no such distinction as that made by Titchener will 
hold seems clear in the very fact which he asks us to note ; 
viz. that ‘‘ change of clearness always involves a change of 
intensity as well” ; which in my view is but another way 
of saying that what in one field appears as a change of what 
we commonly call clearness or vividness, in another field 
appears as a change of what we commonly call intensity. 
If we thus agree that intensity and clearness are names 
for the same characteristic in different settings, then it is 
true, as Pillsbury says, that ‘‘ Attention is fundamentally 
a change in clearness of some one phase or aspect of a mental 
process.” 
If we thus use the word intensity as the generic term we 
may then say that attention-experience appears as not identi- 
cal with intensity, although it involves intensity ; it is 
intensity as related to the manifoldness of all the rest of the 
field which makes the total presentation of the moment of 
1 Attention, p. 11. As Prof. Pillsbury says (p. 3), certain writers (e.g. 
Mach and Stumpf) hold that in attention the intensity of a psychic 
part is increased; while others (¢.g. Wundt) hold that the intensity 
of all but the part attended to is decreased. Pillsbury thinks it impossible 
to determine which of these views is correct.
-P-A-G-E-331
  
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 317 
consideration. Both the focus and the rest of the field of 
attention are noted as involved in the whole complex presen- 
tation of the moment, the focus being the center of most 
marked intensity. 
Sec. 3. The focus of the attention-experience is relatively 
simple, and may at times be almost punctual if we may so 
speak ; yet if we will take the trouble to observe carefully 
we will find that even within this focus a certain minor 
degree of manifoldness may, and usually does, develop, so 
that usually even this focus appears to display a multiple 
character In our: experience of what we call the field of 
attention however we have a very marked complexity of 
closely related elementary psychic parts, any one of which 
may become the focus of the attention-experience, and no 
one of which continues for long as this focus. In picturing 
this to ourselves in visual terms, we are wont to speak of 
the focus as playing over this field of attention, as it were ; 
or as wandering now from one elementary part to another. 
However we describe it, it is clear that this field of attention 
is always highly complex. 
Evidently then this field of attention is a broad, but in 
itself a minor, emphatic psychic system within the whole of 
conscious experience, and a minor psychic system which may 
vary greatly in its breadth. On the other hand the focus 
is a markedly emphatic element within this minor psychic 
system. But just as it is impossible to make a definite dis- 
tinction between any special high wave, or set of waves, 
and the mass of mere tremors on the surface of the sea, 
saying that the former influence the wave surface pattern and 
the other not: just as it is impossible to say that any specially 
active parts of the all active nervous system determine the 
neururgic pattern of the moment, and that the less prominent 
activities in the other parts of the whole system have nothing 
to do with the nature of this neururgic pattern: so it is 
1 Confer Pillsbury, op. cit. pp. 64 ff  
-P-A-G-E-332
  318 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
impossible to make a definite distinction between the field 
of attention and the rest of conscious experience in any given 
moment. The field of attention itself fades off into dim- 
ness, very much as the visual field varies from the clearness 
in the focus to the dimness in the margins of the field. 
There are thus varying modes of attention, if we may so 
speak; and however emphatic any specific field may be, it 
fades away into a field of manifoldness. 
This field of manifoldness, still of consciousness, against 
which the focus and field of attention as such is rather 
indefinitely contrasted (very much as the focus of attention 
is contrasted rather indefinitely against the field of attention 
itself), we may well describe as the field of inattention. 
Our field of consciousness in all moments thus varies all 
the way from the most vivid attention to the vaguest inatten- 
tion. Against this field of inattention both a focus and a 
field of attention appear in contrast. At times, as in our 
active inquisitive moods, the field of attention-experience is 
so prominent that the fading of attention into inattention 
is not noted. At other times, as when we are falling asleep, 
all foci of attention disappear, and even the fields of attention 
seem to wane, then the field of attention itself becomes 
noticeably pervasive and vague, fading off into inattention. 
Sec. 4. It may be well before we go farther to speak of 
certain errors which should be avoided in our thought upon 
this subject. The common man, and even the psychologist, 
often speaks of attention as though it were a faculty rather 
than a psychic situation. We are wont to refer to attention 
as though it were a force that acts. It is thus that, instead 
of speaking of objects attended to, we often, speaking of objects 
of attention, use the phrase as though attention itself were 
an entity active in relation to the object. A presentation 
is an object only as it is contrasted with a subject; and only 
in case it were possible to identify attention with the subject, 
as is of course impossible, would it be proper to look upon
-P-A-G-E-333
  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 319 
attention itself as an active force or entity. Consciousness 
puts on, so to speak, the characteristics of attentiveness 
or inattentiveness under diverse conditions. Attention 
does not do this or that; but consciousness is this or 
that, and in being this or that attention or inattention 
appears. 
Attention is itself a special form of experience. It in- 
volves the existence of a certain definite relation between 
the elements of consciousness ; and this relation so far as 
it appears in itself as a presentation must necessarily involve 
the existence of a differentiation of consciousness. The 
process of attention thus involves the existence of a special 
““ sense of relation ” which itself may, and as we all recognize 
does very often, become a presentation in itself, and then 
we have the attention-experience. 
Again it is to be noted that conditions of attention, as 
well as what we shall later describe as acts of voluntary 
attention, may of course themselves be attended to: that is 
in retrospect the presentation may consist of what are usually 
called the ‘‘ representations” of states of mind in which 
attention was involved. When in reflection we consider 
attention as a process, or when we consider any specific act 
of attention, then we have within the focus of attention a 
presentation which may be described as the relation between 
intensity and manifoldness, which we are here considering. 
II 
Sec. 5. As we have seen above the presentative field 
displays widely divergent phases of attention, varying all 
the way from marked attention to the dimmest of inatten- 
tion. As the presentations which involve marked attention 
are those from which we must judge of the nature of 
consciousness itself it is well to consider the conditions which 
favor the rise of attention. 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  320 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
In cases of marked attention the resentative field, 
as we have noted, consists of a relatively broad field of a 
certain low degree of emphasis, within which some special 
part displays an emphatic intensity in relation with the 
broader field. 
Evidently without the broader field of low degree of 
emphasis attention as such cannot exist. A relatively simple 
and very intense elementary psychic emphasis might exist 
as a presentation, but unless the broader field of less emphasis 
to which it can be related also exists attention cannot be said 
to occur. This means that we must be more or less 
“‘awake ” if the condition of attention is to occur: for this 
awakeness involves the existence of a certain more or less 
distinct noetic pattern, of a more or less broad and definite 
field. That this is true is clear when we consider the effect 
produced in us by a sudden very powerful stimulus when we 
are sound asleep, i.e. when no noticeable field of presentation 
exists,—when the noetic surface, so to speak, presents an 
approximately dead level. If a pistol is discharged at the 
ear of the sound sleeper he certainly experiences a most 
intense sensational presentation ; but he as certainly cannot 
be said to pay attention to it at the moment the vivid sound 
exists. To be sure this intense sound sensation immediately 
awakens him, i.e. immediately following it appears a broad 
field of presentations of low degree of emphasis ; and in 
relation with this field he is likely at once to experience a 
state of attention, which involves a relation between this 
newly appearing broad field and the intense sensational sound 
due to the still existing air reverberations. At times how- 
ever he may not even be able to assimilate this sound with 
his newly given field, and then he will not know what 
awakened him. He will probably find attention arising in 
another direction under such conditions :—will probably find 
himself with eyes straining to look out into the darkness ; 
in this case the intense motor sensations, and not the sound
-P-A-G-E-335
  
, INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 321 
sensations, being contrasted with, and related to, the broader 
field involved with the fact that he is fully awake. 
Assuming then a measure of this ‘‘ awakeness,” assuming 
the existence of a more or less broad field of less emphatic 
presentations, we may now consider objectively the condi- 
tions which favor the appearance of the specially intense 
psychic part which is brought into relation with this broader 
field. 
Sec. 6. (1) a. A relatively high degree, or amplitude if 
we may so speak, of neururgic emphasis within a neururgic 
pattern may be determined by a powerful stimulus reaching 
the nervous system from its environment : just as a big wave 
may be formed on the moderately agitated surface of a lake 
by the fall into the lake of a rock dislodged from its steep 
banks. 
8. The direction of attention may be determined by the 
psychic emphasis due to the reception of a powerful stimulus 
from the environment. This being true we should expect 
to find, as we do, that on the whole sensations are the special 
states in connection with which insistent attention is pecu- 
liarly developed. While it is true that sensations can scarcely 
be said to be the most important objects of attention,1 
nevertheless it is true that no other presentations can be so 
continuously persistent in attention as sensations. A bril- 
liant light, a powerful sound, a stinging pain, will tend 
to force attention to itself notwithstanding that other 
1 As a matter of fact percepts are the most important objects of attention 
for all of us. This is because they involve not only sensational elements, 
but also are developed in connection with wider activities than the mere 
sensations themselves. The movement of attention, which is usually 
considered under the name of association, consists to a very great extent 
of leaps from one percept to another, or from one percept to a modification 
of such percept. As Dr. William James says (Psychology, i. ch. xiv.), 
“association, so far as the word stands for an effect, is between things 
thought of; it is things, not ideas that are associated in the mind. We 
ought to talk of the association of objects, not of the association of ideas.” 
x  
-P-A-G-E-336
    322 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
elements may have been in the ‘‘ focus” when the emphatic 
stimulation was received. You could not attend to the 
substance of this chapter if a pistol was discharged close to 
your ear ; you would have to attend to the sound. 
Sec 7. (2) a. A relatively high degree of neururgic 
emphasis in a neururgic pattern may be determined by what 
we have spoken of in earlier chapters as the recurrence of 
neururgic patterns. It is to be noted that this condition 
distinctly involves what we may speak of as neururgic pre- 
paredness, or what with acknowledgments to Stout we may 
call preformed neururgic “‘ dispositions.” - The old emphasis 
would not recur were not the broad neururgic pattern such 
that it regains what we speak of as its old form upon the 
recurrence of conditions similar to those before given. 
8B. If we recall what we have said of so-called revivals, 
or recurrent secondary presentations, and of their relation to 
primary presentations due to environmental stimulation, we 
see in connection with what has been said in the previous 
section that we should be led to expect to find attention often 
determined by what we are wont to call the ‘‘ recurrence of 
presentations,” that is to the appearance of new presentations 
determined in form by the previous existence of other pre- 
sentations of closely related types. This is of course the 
most ordinary of our experiences. We sit quietly in the 
silence and darkness of the night, apart from the vivid 
stimuli from the environment which might force attention ; 
yet still the condition of attention to one or another pre- 
sentation continues ; and usually the center of attention in 
such cases consists of secondary presentations or ideas rather 
than primary presentations or impressions, and these for the 
most part are what we recognize to be revivals of presenta- 
tions which have appeared in the field of attention in the 
hours and days and years gone by. 
It is very clear that attention due to ‘‘recurrence,” of 
which we now speak, involves necessarily the existence of
-P-A-G-E-337
  
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 323 
what Stout calls ‘‘ psychical dispositions ” ; it involves what 
we may speak of as psychic preparedness. Unless this pre- 
paredness existed no such rise into the focus of attention of 
secondary presentations due to past presentations could occur. 
It becomes evident therefore that this preparedness is of the 
greatest importance in relation to the process of attention, 
as we shall see very distinctly when we take up our next 
point. Even when attention seems to be determined entirely 
by the psychic emphases due to the reception of powerful 
stimuli from the environment, some measure of preparedness 
must exist in the broad field of presentations of low degree 
of emphasis. The intense sensation must relate itself in 
some measure with the existing noetic pattern or it cannot 
be attended to. As Stout! says “‘ sense impressions are 
capable of arousing attention if, and so far as, they are 
capable of exciting some preformed system of psychical dis- 
positions, or of taking part in some pre-existing process 
which already involves the activity of such a system.” 
Sec. 8. (3) We find cases where attention upon a special 
psychic element arises primarily directly or indirectly as the 
result of stimuli reaching us from without, but where its 
fixation is due almost entirely to the preparedness of the 
psychic system, i.e. almost entirely to the existence of 
““ psychical dispositions,” or unemphasized noetic patterns ; 
and here we are dealing with cases where attention may be 
said to be due to assimilation. The striking of the clock 
in the adjoining room does not become prominent in atten- 
tion in this hour of leisure: but were it to strike in my office 
on a day full of engagements it would certainly lead me to 
attend to the appointments I had for the hour tocome. The 
phrase ‘‘ Darwinian hypothesis ” uttered by my friend in my 
hearing does not become the center of attention as I write 
these lines: but were I writing on the Emotions, the chances 
are that the phrase would seem to seize me, as it were,— 
1 Analytical Psychology, i. p. 187.  
-P-A-G-E-338
324 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
would become the center of my field of attention,—and I 
probably would stop this writing and ask my friend his 
opinion of Darwin’s emotional theory as related to the 
James-Lange theory. 
III 
Sec. 9. (4) a. Finally, a high degree of neururgic em- 
phasis in a part may be determined by some obscure influence 
from the mass of the nervous system with which this part, 
under the conditions we are considering, is directly or indirectly 
related. One who is watching a storm at sea will observe 
_ occasional high waves which shoot up into the air, apparently 
without relation to the prevailing wave patterns, and yet 
which must clearly be due to some obscure influence existing 
within the whole agitated wave surface. Our nervous 
systems are so related as to present a vast variety of 
“dispositions ” ; and it would be surprising indeed if some 
part of a given neururgic pattern were not at times empha- 
sized by assimilation with underlying patterns within the 
broad systems which are too unemphatic to be discerned, 
the influence which emphasizes the activity of the part being 
due to the assimilation of its activity with some obscure 
and unobservable “‘ disposition ” existing within the mass of 
the nervous system. 
8. The emphasis in attention is often determined by some 
obscure influence within the preeminent field of manifoldness, 
i.e. the field of inattention. Within this broad field there 
must exist psychical dispositions, within it must be developed 
noetic patterns, although these be so unemphatic that they 
do not appear as presentations. In the very fact that they 
are developed within this field of inattention in contrast 
with which presentations appear, the form of these unem- 
phasized noetic patterns must be incapable of appearing as 
presentations: but if they thus exist they must be capable 
of acting to sustain the intensity of any special psychic 
   
-P-A-G-E-339
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 325 
element with which they can assimilate ; and this will result 
in the enforcement of attention in special directions by 
influences from within that part of consciousness which 
cannot be given as a presentation, but which we designate 
as the field of inattention.? 
But we have seen reason in the first book to hold that 
this field of inattention,—this broad field in which manifold- 
ness is most markedly developed,—is the Self to which 
presentations are given ; the Self which is represented to us 
in states of self-consciousness in its simulacrum the empirical 
ego. We should therefore expect to find self-conscious 
experiences which indicate that the non-presentable Self often 
determines attention. This is in truth a most obvious fact ; 
for as Stout ? says the ‘‘ common sense view is that attention 
is the self-direction of the mind to an object.” It is true 
that observation shows us many cases where attention appears 
to be determined entirely by the stimulations reaching us 
from the environment: but the judgment of ‘‘ common 
sense” just mentioned surely shows at least that a vast 
proportion of cases of marked attention aré appreciated as 
involving the action of what men call the self. 
Sec. 10. It is not difficult to show, as will appear in 
Book u1., that the Self must always be involved in every 
act of attention: for if the whole of consciousness is a system 
of interrelated psychic systems no partial activity can fail to 
affect, or to be affected by, the general noetic condition of 
the mass of the system: and no emphasis of a psychic part 
can appear without some enforcement from the field of 
inattention, if. the psychic part assimilates with the noetic 
1Confer Stout, Analytical Psychology, i. p. 183. ‘The systematic unity 
of the attention process depends upon the presence of the psychic fringe. 
The systematic complexity depends upon the tendency of this or that 
explicit part of an implicitly apprehended whole to coordinate itself 
simultaneously or successively with other parts or aspects, according to

condition of this field at the moment in question ; or with- 
out some inhibition in case it does not so assimilate. In 
other words, no psychic part can appear in attention without 
involving some reaction from the Self. And this implies 
that although, as we shall presently see, voluntary attention 
is a special form of the attention-experience, nevertheless 
any attempt to separate in any sharp and distinct way 
voluntary from involuntary attention is inaccurate and 
deceptive.” 
1Jt will be evident to the reader that I thus uphold the view that 
the Self may actually at times act to increase the intensity of a given 
presentation through the process of assimilation, although often the effect 
of increase of intensity is due practically to a maintenance of a given 
intensity while other intensities wane. 
In his Groundwork of Psychohgy (p. 57) Stout tells us that the notion 
that attention intensifies sensation is due “to a confusion between intensity 
and clearness or distinctness. If, in attending, we intensify sensation at 
all, we do so only within narrow limits. Otherwise we should often 
defeat our own purpose by altering the very object which we are interested 
in knowing. If I want to know precisely how loud a sound is or how 
bright a color is, I attend to it. But this procedure would stultify itself 
if the very act of attending made the sound louder or the color brighter. 
As a matter of fact, we can follow with increasing attention the gradual 
fading away of a sound into silence.” 
I agree that the difficulty here referred to is due “to a confusion 
between intensity and clearness or distinctness” as Stout says; and in 
this connection would refer the reader to the discussion of Chap. vim. 
Sec. 4, But, as I there attempt to show, clearness and distinctness are 
merely our names for special types of intensity. I agree that the limits 
within which sensations are intensified are usually narrow. But I would 
hold that voluntary attention may, and actually often does, alter the very 
object we are interested in knowing, and that great care is necessary 
if we are to avoid defeating our own purpose. It is true that “we 
can follow with increasing attention the gradual fading away of a sound 
into silence,” but I think it certain that the fading would be much 
more rapid did we not attend. 
2Confer Pillsbury, of. cit, p. 311. Although Dr. James makes use 
of this distinction (Psychohgy, i. pp. 416f.), he practically acknowledges 
its unimportance where he speaks (Briefér Course, p. 221) of the “ perpetual 
presence of selective attention” as a ‘patent fact.”
-P-A-G-E-341
  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 327 
As we have seen in Book 1., the very fact that this reaction 
by the Self occurs involves often the rise of a state of self- 
consciousness in which there appears as a presentation a 
broad unemphasized undifferentiable psychic mass which we 
describe as the empirical ego, in relation to which the most 
emphatic element appears as an object. Now the self- 
conscious direction of attention by the empirical ego is what 
is recognized as voluntary attention. And here we find 
before us the consideration of the very essence of conation 
or will. ‘‘ To will a given act,” says Royce,’ ‘‘is to think 
attentively of that act to the exclusion or neglect of the 
representation or imagining of any and all other acts.” And 
if this is true, then all volition is found to be statable in 
terms of that form of attention which we call voluntary 
attention. 
And it appears also, as we have seen, that all attention 
must be conative, as each act of attention is in some measure 
determined by the action of that part of the psychic system 
that is apart from the presentation attended to. This cona- 
tive aspect of attention is of course not always explicit, is in 
fact usually merely implicit: whenever it is explicit we have 
the experience of the active empirical ego maintaining 
attention. 
It must be very evident to all who study their self- 
conscious states that in all cases where I am able to say that 
I attend the empirical ego acts to assimilate compatible, and 
fails to assimilate incompatible, elements of the object: that 
is to say in consequence of its own inherent nature it acts 
to produce the emphasis of the intensity of assimilable 
elements within the object ; it selects, as we say, from the 
mass of elements contained in the objects those with which 
its own nature can join to produce the element’s emphasis, 
and thus forces them into attention. 
As we have seen, whenever the action of the empirical ego 
1 Outline of Psychology, p. 369. Italics mine.
-P-A-G-E-342
  328 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
appears explicitly through its welcome of one and its rejec- 
tion of the other of two incompatible presentations, then we 
have what is clearly marked voluntary action, and so far as 
this relates to attention we have clearly marked voluntary 
attention. If the distinction between voluntary and in- 
voluntary attention is to be maintained it must be between 
attention in which the will act is explicitly involved, and 
attention in which it is not. 
While it is of course true that some attention is experi- 
enced as explicitly determined by the empirical ego in an 
act of will, and that some is not ; nevertheless this fact must 
not be interpreted to mean that there is no self-conscious 
conation except in a clearly marked act of choice. It is true 
indeed that we may if we choose study attention as non- 
conative, as involuntary, as apart from its aspect as distinctly 
affected by the empirical ego ; but this is because in many 
experiences the empirical ego is not attended to at all, or 
because it but slightly affects the object, or is overwhelmed 
as it were by the power, and unavoidableness, and ungovern- 
ableness, of the stimuli which for the moment seem alone to 
determine attention. It seems clear however that just so far 
as one observes the empirical ego at all in attention in 
connection with its object, just so far is one able to note, if 
he use care, the process of reaction of the empirical ego upon 
its object, even though it appear at times to struggle but 
weakly, and perhaps in vain, to govern and guide the stream 
forced upon it from without itself. But it must be evident 
to the reader that we are here touching upon ground which 
in some aspects will be more properly considered at length 
in Book 111., where we consider the nature of the Self. 
IV 
Sec. 11. It may be well here to refer to certain problems 
relating to attention upon which the views above considered 
- seem to have a bearing. 
   
-P-A-G-E-343
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 329 
It has often been noted that it is impossible to maintain 
attention fixed for an indefinite period upon a specific pre- 
sentation even by the greatest effort. This is usually treated 
as a phenomena of what is explicitly recognized as voluntary 
attention: but as a matter of fact we are here dealing with 
a general phenomena of all forms of attention. 
As we have seen in Chapter vit., an intensity cannot be 
appreciated as maintained of equal degree in successive 
moments unless the elemental intensity is actually increased. 
But of course this increase of elemental intensity cannot 
continue indefinitely: an intensity cannot then appear as 
marked in relation to the broad psychic field for an indefinite 
time, and therefore attention even when it is of the so-called 
“involuntary ” type cannot be long maintained. For this 
reason in our ordinary life attention is constantly shifting ; 
even where an intense presentation is given to which our 
attention is compelled we soon find ourselves attending to 
other matters. When we first enter a boiler shop we can 
pay attention to nothing but the noise ; but presently we 
find ourselves attending to the movements of the mechanics 
and machinery as though there were no noise. 
The same situation is discovered in cases of clear voluntary 
attention, and these attract our notice because of the sense of 
effort accompanying them. The attempt to maintain atten- 
tion means the effort of the psychic system to maintain the 
elemental intensity. But as we have seen the whole psychic 
system is rapidly affected by the intense presentation ; and 
after a relatively short time therefore even the action of the 
system itself will fail to maintain the elemental intensity as 
an object of attention in contrast with the broad psychic field 
which has itself in a measure gained the attributes of the 
presentation. 
On the physical side this means that the increased activity 
of the stimulated parts has been communicated to the whole 
neururgic system, so that the highly active part no longer 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  330 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
stands in contrast with the whole neururgic system which 
(when we appreciate the act of voluntary attention) tends 
to assimilate it. 
Sec. 12. If the view above stated is correct there must 
be an indefinite number of forms of attention. Attention 
is not a special mental state which might involve the action 
of certain definite brain tracts ;* it is a general process which 
may appear in an indefinite number and variety of forms, 
which involve activity in an indefinite number and variety 
of brain tracts. This carries with it a rejection of the notion 
that there can be a ‘‘centre of attention.” As Stout says? 
“The nervous correllate of attention is not to be found in 
the excitation of this or that portion of nervous matter, but 
in a certain complex form of the nervous process.” 
Attention may vary therefore in the nature of the pre- 
sentations attended to. We may attend to sensations, to 
percepts, to concepts, to emotional states, and to conative 
states, to pleasure—pain and other qualifications of various 
states. The intensity may be anywhere within the whole 
field of presentations ; and the broad psychic field with which 
this intensity is related may in like manner vary as to its 
content. 
This variation of the related field is important in the fact 
that it implies that disparate intense partial presentations 
will seldom bear close relations to the same fields; and this 
would lead us to expect that the existence of attention to 
one set of partial presentations would in general make difficult 
the shifting of attention to a disparate set of partial presenta- 
tions. This we find to be the case. If we are deep in 
1 The processes of “fixation ” of which we speak below may well involve 
action in certain special brain tracts: but these processes of fixation are not 
of the essence of attention, 
2 Op. cit. 1, 201. Confer also in this connection McDougall’s interesting 
hypotheses (Mind, N.S. 43 and 47) in which he explains attention as a 
general process having its seat in the “‘ synapses.”
-P-A-G-E-345
ee   
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 331 
thought, for instance, sensational effects do not easily “attract 
our attention”; and the same fact appears throughout our 
experience. 
Sec. 13. In connection with what we have just said it 
is important to note again (confer Sec. 2) that attention may 
be divided; that there may be more than one centre of 
intensity related to the same broad psychic field. Further- 
more, as Kiilpe’ says “the greater the range of attention, 
the lower is the degree of consciousness attached to any indi- 
vidual content: while vice versa, the number of the objects 
grasped by attention decreases, as concentration upon any one 
of them increases.” And this too we find to accord with 
our view: for the larger the number of points of emphasis in 
a neururgic pattern, the less clearly will any one emphasis 
stand in contrast from its related mass: and correspondingly 
the more points of emphasis there are in a given noetic pat- 
tern, the less will any one of them gain that emphasis which 
is necessary if we appreciate distinctly its relation with the 
mass of the consciousness of the moment: the clearest 
differentiation can only appear when only one marked pre- 
sentative point appears in the field of attention, so that every 
thing but this clearly discriminated point fuses into a mass 
which stands in contrast with it. 
All this implies that attention may be more or less vivid 
in relation to the condition of consciousness in a given 
moment. But it implies also a further differentiation of 
attention due to the grade of consciousness, if we may so 
speak, existing at the time the specific emphasis appears. 
The bark of the dog, for instance, attracts more attention 
when I am just aroused from sleep, than it does during the 
existence of my active waking consciousness. 
Sec. 14. It has been maintained by many modern psycho- 
logists that our experience in attention is determined entirely 
by the muscular sensations involved in the process of the 
1« The Problem of Attention,” Monist, Oct. 1902, p. 57. 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
  332 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
fixation of attention: and even so cautious a writer as Mr. 
James Sully finds himself led to hold that, in cases of sen- 
sational attention at least, muscular sensation is ‘‘the main 
determinant factor in the process” ; although he admits that 
other factors are involved. To one who approaches this 
subject from our standpoint this position appears to be an 
unwarranted one ; for it is clear that if attention is a general 
process it is not to be identified with any special emphasis 
such as that given in sensations accompanying the process of 
fixation. 
It is to be granted that when I attend to an object in the 
outer world the muscular sensations are the most emphatic 
elements caught as it were as I attempt to analyse my experi- 
ence, some of these muscular sensations being related to the 
bodily position, some to the focusing of the eye and to 
arrangements of the other sense organs which aid the clearest 
apprehension of the sensational experiences which are given, 
some to the inhibitive muscular strains involved in the 
tendency to avoid a loss of this concentration. This may 
be granted however without holding that these muscular sen- 
sations are of the essence of attention, or even that they are 
of fundamental import. For when, for instance, I pay close 
attention, as I may well do, to my intestinal experiences I 
find much less reason to make so much of the muscular 
sensational elements of fixation in the experience of attention. 
And the weakness of the theory becomes evident when we 
consider that the cases of marked sensational attention, which 
being subject to experiment are relied upon by those who 
uphold this theory, are all cases of distinctly voluntary 
attention ; and that, as Stout? points out, the process of 
fixation itself involves volitional experience of the same type 
as that involved in our willing to move the arm, or to perform 
any bodily action. This volitional control of bodily action 
itself involves volitional attention, as we have already seen 
1 Human Mind, 1, 149. 2 Op. cit. 1, 243.
-P-A-G-E-347
  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 333 
above ; and this shows us clearly that our volitional control 
of attention is of deeper import than the processes of fixation. 
Those who have defended the view in question surely forget 
to study carefully the very large proportion of our less 
emphatic states of attention which are not concerned with 
the discrimination of sensational experiences. 
The whole matter is put in a nutshell by Stout ? as follows: 
“The immediate effect produced by these sensory adjust- 
ments is fairly comparable with the effect produced by other 
devices for increasing our sensibility, such, e.g. as the use 
of a magnifying glass. From this point of view we have 
as much justification for regarding the putting on of a pair 
of spectacles as an attention process, as we have for regarding 
ocular adjustment in this way. It is broadly true that we 
rarely accommodate our sense organs for the reception of 
impressions from an object unless we are attending to that 
object. But this fact seems fairly explicable on our general 
view of sensory accommodation as an arrangement for intensi- 
fying and maintaining attention, and not as belonging to the 
essence of the attention process itself.” 
Sec. 15. All the above facts lead us to emphasize the 
relativity of attention. Attention consists in the relation of 
a point or points of emphasis with the contradistinguished 
mass of consciousness. The number of these points of 
emphasis may vary, and pari passu the degree of attention 
will vary. The grade of the consciousness of the moment 
may also vary, if we may so speak, and again we shall have 
variations in the form of attention given. 
From a certain point of view it may be said that attention 
is relative in another sense, viz. that we would never experi- 
ence attention but for changes in the form of consciousness. 
Given perfectly stable conditions, however high the grade 
of neural and noetic activity may be, we should soon find 
our neururgic and noetic patterns fading off into a dead level. 
1 Op. cit. 1, 204 fF.
-P-A-G-E-348
334 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP L 
The emphases in the neururgic parts would disappear, and 
attention would disappear from consciousness. This how- 
ever would not by any means imply the disappearance of 
consciousness itself : it would merely mean that the field of 
attention had faded away, and that the field of inattention 
had become pervasive and paramount. Some reader may 
well say that such a psychic state as that above described 
would not be what we men would usually call a state of 
consciousness at all: and this is true, for we are able to con- 
sider and discuss only those states of consciousness in which 
some measure of attention appears. But of this objection 
we need not here speak at length, for we have already seen 
reason to judge that it is absurd to hold that our field of 
attention is the whole of consciousness. Yet it is just this 
view that is implicitly maintained by those who uphold the 
doctrine of the so-called ‘‘relativity of consciousness,” so 
far as that doctrine involves the notion that the essence of 
consciousness lies in the change from one psychic state to 
another, and the appreciation of the contrast between the 
two states involved. What they thus speak of as the rela- 
tivity of consciousness should in our view be spoken of as 
one phase of the relativity of attention. That attention is 
relative may be held to be an indubitable fact, but this without 
involving the notion that a psychic state cannot exist apart 
from the field of attention, as is sometimes implied by those 
who enlarge upon the doctrine here considered. All other 
forms of this doctrine seem to be founded upon the observed 
fact that under a prolonged stimulusof even very high intensity 
what is usually called consciousness, but what should properly 
be called attention, is gradually lost, and this has been inter- 
preted to mean that change is necessary to the existence of, 
and is the essence of, consciousness.!’ But as Prof. James 
truly says, “if we physically could get a feeling that should: 
last eternally unchanged” there is no proof ‘‘that it would

so
-P-A-G-E-349
  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 335 
not be felt as long as it lasted and felt for just what it is, all 
the time.” 
To explain the ‘‘relativity of consciousness” as here 
viewed therefore is to explain, in reference to our general 
view, the fact that a presentation due to a prolonged 
stimulus of high relative intensity disappears ; and this has 
already been shown to be a necessary result of the fact that 
consciousness is the coincident of the activity of a neural 
system, which after being stimulated to high degree in a part 
(coincident with a presentation attended to) acquires gradually 
a higher grade of activity as a whole, so that the activity of 
the part no longer stands apart from the activity of the whole 
system, and the coincident partial psychic element is no longer 
held in attention as a presentation to the broad psychic system, 
i.e. the Self. 
V. Tue Movement or ATTENTION. ASSOCIATION. 
Sec. 16. If human consciousness was of such nature that 
all forms of attention were determined by the action of 
stimuli upon our physical organs, the movement of attention 
would present no problem of interest even for a psychologist 
from another sphere who might be supposed to have access 
to our inner experiences; for under such conditions these 
experiences would consist of successions of complex forms 
of attention, corresponding with definite successions of objec- 
tive situations, all of which would bear certain relations so 
explicit, so inherent, and so self explanatory, that even 
the spirit from the other sphere would scarcely pause to 
consider them. 
Even if our spirit agreed that trains of secondary presenta- 
tions exist in connection with such primary presentations as we 
have described, these secondary trains, when appearing apart 
from primary presentations as they do, would not be likely
-P-A-G-E-350
336 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
to be thought to present a serious problem provided they 
appeared always to maintain in attention the same order 
and relations that are observable in connection with our 
primary presentations. But asa matter of fact the movement 
of attention to these secondary presentations very frequently 
does not maintain the order and relations observable in the 
stream of our primary presentations. When, so far as this 
is possible, we exclude primary trains, and find attention in 
the main occupied with secondary presentations or revivals 
only, then we cannot but note that these secondary presenta- 
tions often fail to display the recognized order and relations 
which their corresponding primary presentations displayed ; 
and beyond this that secondary presentations often seem to 
arise out of all relation with all others which have preceded, 
or which exist together with them. Moreover, these ap- 
parently unrelated secondary presentations have a way of 
forcing our attention, of intruding themselves into our trains 
of successive primary presentations. This impression of 
violet and orange color, the noise of thunder, find themselves 
pressed out of attention, perhaps by the shought of a friend 
who is ill in a foreign clime. 
Thus has the problem of the movement of attention been 
forced upon psychologists. It is a problem which though 
interesting and important in itself is not of great moment 
in connection with the study of the inner nature of presenta- 
tions with which we are here concerned ; it is a problem of 
genesis rather than of analysis. This serves to account for 
the subordinate place and the brief consideration here given 
to this subject. : 
But long ago a certain band of psychologists, in their 
effort to account for the observed facts, hit upon what they 
thought to be an explanation which involved an atomistic 
theory of consciousness; and for them the problem became 
necessarily involved with the problem of analysis. This 
explanation was developed into what we call the doctrine of 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 337 
the association of ideas, which led to the founding and growth 
of the associational school, which notwithstanding its weak- 
nesses has given to psychology an important record of 
introspective experience, and an enlightenment in regard to 
the nature of consciousness, the value of which it is difficult 
for us to over-estimate. 
Sec. 17. Although we approach the subject from the 
standpoint of opponents of psychic atomism it may be well 
to consider for a moment the points in relation to the move- 
ment of attention made by the associationists. Having 
observed that certain orders of secondary presentations, or 
images or ideas, followed the orders of successive primary 
presentations or impressions ; and having assumed that these 
secondary presentations or ideas are copies of primary presen- 
tations or impressions; they laid down laws which aimed 
to explain the appearance of the apparently unrelated second- 
ary presentations, of which we have above spoken, in terms 
which would harmonize their occurrence with our experience 
of the succession of primary presentations; and they thus 
gave us the laws of association by contiguity, by similarity, 
by contrast, by cause and effect, etc., etc. And, as we hold, 
they went much farther than they were warranted in going 
in the attempt to explain, not the appearance in attention 
of secondary presentations, but the very nature of these 
presentations themselves, claiming them to result from a 
quasi physical, or quasi chemical, combination of psychic 
atoms according to these laws of association which they 
believed they had discovered. 
With this atomistic doctrine, which we altogether reject, 
we have no concern here: but the laws of association them- 
selves which were thus enunciated may well be considered 
and if possible explained in terms of our conception of 
attention, if for no other reason than that our psychological 
masters of the past have made so much of them. 
Sec. 18. As we have already stated the mass of our 
xX
-P-A-G-E-352
  338 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP L. 
' secondary presentations appear in an order which corresponds 
.to a noticeable degree with the order in which their related 
primary presentations originally appeared. The postman 
whistles, the maid appears in my library, the letters are placed 
in my hand, are opened and read, and I write various replies : 
here is a series of primary presentations. If, some hours 
later, in the silence of the night, I think of the postman, I 
am very likely to think in succession of his whistling, of 
the maid handing me the letters, of my reading them, and 
of the contents of the letters and my replies: here is a series 
of secondary presentations following in the same order in 
which the related primary presentations appeared. 
Now, as I have suggested above, did this always happen 
we would probably not consider that the movement of atten- 
tion involved a problem of importance. But it often very 
evidently does not happen: and if we examine the facts 
closely we find that actually it seldom happens. We find 
perhaps that when we come to the thought of the letters, it 
is the thought of the third letter only that appears in atten- 
tion; and that the thought of reading the others does not 
follow; but that the thought of the answer written in the 
third letter does follow. Or if the letter was an important 
one we note perhaps the sudden ebullition of a thought out 
of all relation with the series of primary presentations of the 
morning ; ‘‘how stupid of me,” I perhaps say to myself, 
“John will entirely misunderstand my answer ; I must write 
again to him to-morrow.” 
The consideration of such occurrences leads us to see that 
there is (1st) a general tendency on the part of our series 
of revived secondary presentations to follow the order of the 
corresponding primary presentations: and (2nd) as evidently 
many a striking exception to this rule. 
The associationists traced laws in relation to this second 
fact and attempted by means of these laws to explain the 
first fact. It will serve our purpose best to attempt to explain 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 339 
the first fact, and then to ask how far this explanation accounts 
for the second fact. 
It is generally agreed by the best of our modern psycho- 
logists! that all forms of association are reducible to the 
laws of contiguity and similarity ; and we may therefore limit 
our brief consideration to these two laws. 
Sec. 19. As we have argued in Book 1. it seems safe to say 
that each series of primary presentations involves a series of 
secondary presentations, the bond between the members of 
which is an identity of noetic elements within the body of the 
noetic systems involved. If this is true then there must 
always be a series of successive secondary presentations 
involved with, and running parallel with, each series of suc- 
cessive primary presentations, the successive noetic patterns 
involved being bound together by common psychic elements. 
It is natural therefore that we find that, if for any reason one 
member of this successive series of secondary presentations 
arises apart from the existence of its corresponding primary 
presentation, the connected secondary presentations should 
follow in the order in which they originally existed parallel 
with the series of successive primary presentations. It would 
appear thus that we do not speak accurately when we say 
that the series of secondary presentations follows the order 
of its corresponding series of primary presentations. Strictly 
speaking we should say that a series of secondary presenta- 
tions is revived in an order which was already given in the 
secondary presentations which were involved with the original 
series of primary presentations. 
It seems clear then that we should expect to find, what we 
do find, a general tendency on the part of our series of 
revived secondary presentations to follow the order of corre- 
sponding series of primary presentations. 
Sec. 20. But as we have seen there are many cases which 
1 Confer ¢.g. Hoffding, Outlines of Psychology, p. 157 of English translation. 
Also Royce, Outlines of Psychology, p. 210. 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  340 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
appear as marked exceptions to this rule: and this is explic- 
able when we consider that certain of the secondary series, 
which accompany the primary series, must involve relations 
with ‘‘ psychical dispositions” of more breadth and import- 
ance, and that others must involve relations with “‘ psychical 
dispositions” of less breadth and importance. Furthermore 
there are likely to have been other successions of secondary 
presentations, involving other ‘‘sets” of the psychic system 
as a whole, in which some part of the newly appearing suc- 
cession of secondary presentations may have also been a part : 
and if this is true this part of the newly appearing series 
must therefore be related with two or more “‘ psychical dis- 
positions”; and if the ‘‘ psychical disposition” related to 
this element in a past series is broader and more important 
than the ‘psychical disposition” related to this element in 
the newly appearing series, evidently there will be every 
reason to expect a shifting of attention in the direction of 
the more important “‘ psychical disposition,” and away from 
the series corresponding with that originally involved with 
the primary series. Thus, to return to our example above, 
it is easy to explain how attention to my reply to the third 
letter leads, not to attention to the contents of the fourth letter, 
but to attention again to the contents of the third letter, 
and to the effects upon my correspondent of the reply I have 
made, and to my thought of a correction of the wrong 
impression my reply is likely to have given. 
Sec. 21. Turning now to the two laws of association by 
contiguity and by similarity which we here consider, we may 
note in the first place that they are on different planes, as it 
were. When we say that ideas A and B become successively 
the centres of attention because they are similar, we are 
evidently dealing with pure introspection ; we are expressing 
the fact that in connection with the succession as viewed in 
reflection we note the similarity ‘‘sense of relation”? When 
on the other hand we say that ideas C and D become succes-
-P-A-G-E-355
  
INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 341 
sively the centres of attention because the impressions to 
which they are related are simultaneous or successive, and 
enunciate the law of contiguity, we clearly have in mind 
conditions in the world of objects, and not the experience 
which we describe as introspective.* 
We shall attempt to express the facts which are covered 
by both these laws on one plane, so to speak, viz. in terms 
of our introspective experience. 
Sec, 22. Whenever a series of secondary presentations 
which is being given in attention is broken into by a secondary 
presentation which does not appear to be directly related to 
this series, the associationists have been accustomed to explain 
the shifting of attention in subjective terms as due to the 
law of similarity, provided the intruding presentation seemed 
similar to any presentation of the series broken into. On 
the other hand they, turning to an objective view, have been 
accustomed to explain this shifting of the attention as due 
to association by contiguity, provided any part of the first 
1In his Human Mind (i. pp. 334 ff.) James Sully well says : “Suggestion 
by similarity and suggestion by contiguity—answer to two perfectly distinct 
directions of the reproductive process. The latter... tends to a reinstate- 
ment of experiential wholes, or time-connected aggregates ; in other words 
to a reproduction along with each presentative element of its experiential 
context. The former, on the other hand, brings together elements of 
experience not necessarily connected in time at all, but lying, it may be, 
very remote in the time order.” . . . “Associative (contiguous) repro- 
duction is externally conditioned, viz. by the time-proximity of the original 
presentations, whereas assimilative reproduction is internally conditioned by 
the psychological (or psycho-physical) relation of the presentation.” 
Mr. Sully, as his readers will note, goes so far as to say that suggestion by 
similarity is no association at all : and he is justified in this if we use the 
word association to refer to a guasi mechanical process, as the originators of 
the associational doctrines surely did. It is not worth our while however to 
stop to enlarge upon this aspect of the subject, for our aim here is not to 
uphold or oppose a doctrine of the association of ideas, but to explain in 
our own terms the movement of attention which has been expressed in the 
formulation of these laws.

  342 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
mentioned series can be discovered to have been related in 
the past to an original series in which belonged the primary 
presentation corresponding with the intruding secondary 
presentation. But it is apparent as we have seen that the 
intrusion of such presentations is easily explicable and also 
in subjective terms, as due to movements of attention in 
series dependent upon the relation of presentations to diverse 
‘‘ psychical dispositions.” It is equally clear however, if we 
look at these cases of contiguity thus subjectively, that the 
real bond between the successive presentations is a bond of 
identity in parts of the connected presentations, even though 
this be indiscernible. If this bond of identity between the 
two successive presentations had been explicit and clear, it 
would certainly have involved a recognition of a similarity 
between the two successive presentations. 
Cases of so-called association by similarity would therefore 
seem to be cases of the movement of attention which involve 
an explicit introspective appreciation of the bond of identity 
which always unites the two successive secondary presenta- 
tions. 
Cases of so-called association by contiguity on the other 
hand would seem to be cases of the movement of attention 
which do not involve an explicit introspective appreciation 
of this bond of identity which unites the two secondary 
presentations, but which do involve a recognition of the 
objective fact that a previous series of presentations has 
corresponded in its order with the newly appearing series, 
this fact, as we have just seen, involving an implicit relation 
of similarity, even though it be unrecognized. 
In those cases of the movement of attention where presen- 
tations apparently unrelated to any series arise in attention, 
cases which involve apparently neither similarity nor con- 
tiguity, the associationists were wont to assume that implicit 
similarity and contiguity must obtain. In our view every 
movement of attention involves the conditions which when
-P-A-G-E-357
  INTENSITY AND MANIFOLDNESS 343 
explicit yield the recognition of both similarity and con- 
tiguity. The cases here considered therefore may be described 
as cases of non-explicit, similarity and contiguity at the same 
time. For there must be a bond of identity between the 
successive presentations of a series whether this is recognized 
or not, and if we look at the matter objectively we see that 
this bond involves contiguity. At the same time if we 
consider these cases subjectively we see that this bond of 
identity involves the occurrence, in a form too dim to be 
recognized, of that special ‘‘sense of relation” which if 
emphatic enough would lead to a recognition of similarity. 
In the cases before us we fail to observe either a similarity, 
or a contiguity based upon the identity of elements which 
this similarity itself involves. But for all that the bond of 
identity of elements inherent in the successive presentations 
must exist as the successive noetic patterns overlap ; for, but 
for this overlapping the second pattern would not appear to 
succeed the one preceding it. And in this overlapping we 
have the basis of the objective association by contiguity.

Sec. 1. We have seen in Chapter x1. that a direct 
relation exists between the emphasis of intensity and the 
emphasis of realness in connection with a given presentation. 
If, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, we have in 
attention-experience the appreciation of a special sense of 
relation given by the correlation of the intensity sense of 
relation and the manifoldness sense of relation, as displayed 
in conjunction within the same noetic pattern; then we 
should expect to note that a special sense of relation is 
developed by the correlation of the realness sense of relation 
developed in connection with a special part of the noetic 
pattern, and the manifoldness sense of relation developed in 
connection with the presented broad noetic system apart from 
the very real part. 
This special sense of relation would be distinguished in 
its most marked forms by the special prominence of a realness 
in contrast with the characteristics of the rest of the psychic

system, and would be likely to be given with especial force- 
fulness in connection with powerful impressions upon us from 
our environment in connection with which, as we have seen, 
a high degree of realness is given. 
When we ask ourselves whether there is any broad char- 
acteristic of this nature especially given in connection with 
impressions upon us from our environment, we at once note 
that the quality of objectiveness is thus given, a quality which 
is clearly coupled with a sense of realness, and which is 
attributed especially to those complex imr->ssional presenta- 
tions that have spatial characterist® ich we describe 
as “‘objects in the outer wo ‘cial objective

“objects in the outer world,” it ant we com-

Thus as the correlation of Intensity and Manifoldness 
gives us the relation which we describe as Attention, so here 
the correlation of Realness and Manifoldness gives us the 
Object-Subject relation.* 
The object-subject relation itself is given as a special form 
1 The reader will notice that the form of this chapter follows closely that 
of the chapter in which we consider the nature of Attention. That this is 
possible shows clearly the close similarity between attention and the object- 
subject relation.

346 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
of experience. It involves the existence of a certain definite 
relation between the elements of consciousness, which relation 
so far as it appears as a presentation must necessarily involve 
the existence of a differentiation of consciousness. The 
object-subject recognition involves the existence of a special 
“sense of relation,” which when appreciated as belonging 
to a given complex presentation leads us to describe this 
presentation as one which involves self-consciousness. 
During a large part of our lives our experience consists 
merely of the presentations which display a high degree of 
realness, no object-subject relation being appreciable; so 
when this object-subject relation begins to be appreciated we 
naturally find an emphasis of the object in which marked 
realness inheres, rather than of the subject. In such cases 
the major emphases display explicitly a quality which leads 
us to speak of them as objects, while their relation to a subject 
upon which this objectiveness depends is still altogether 
unemphatic and implicit. This quality of objectiveness to 
be sure exists only as attached to part of a complex noetic 
pattern, it appears only as it stands in relation to another 
special quality which is attached to the remainder of the 
noetic pattern, which quality when explicit gives this other 
part of the noetic pattern the characteristic which leads us 
to speak of it as subjective. 
As we have already seen in Book 1. the part of a noetic 
pattern which stands in contradistinction from the emphasis 
is the unemphatic noetic mass in connection with which mani- 
foldness is highly developed,—the field of inattention,—the 
Self. The special subjective qualification which brings the 
objectiveness of the emphasis into relief remains at times 
entirely within this Self, and is implicit rather than explicit, 
even as the Self is in its very nature non-presentable: the 
subjectiveness is for the most part ‘‘felt,” as we say, rather 
than explicitly recognized. 
But under certain conditions this subjectiveness may 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 347 
become explicit, and it is then that we speak of the whole 
experience as a state of self-consciousness. When we are 
clearly self-conscious the noetic emphasis consists of an 
empirical ego (which we hold to be a simulacrum of the Self) 
with which the object is distinctly related. The noetic pat- 
tern thus displays a double emphasis in which appears both 
the empirical ego and its object. 
Now the whole of this duplex emphasis as it appears in 
reflection has the quality of objectiveness in itself as con- 
trasted with the implicit subjectiveness of the Self : not only 
is the object which is related with the empirical ego an “‘ object 
of attention” as we say, but the empirical ego itself is also 
an “‘object of attention.” Nevertheless within this totality 
in which objectiveness is explicit there appears a special 
enhancement of the objectiveness quality in connection with 
the object related to the empirical ego, and in contrast there- 
with a special admixture of the subjectiveness quality in 
connection with the empirical ego itself. Thus while the 
whole of the duplex emphasis of the moment of self-con- 
sciousness is objectified in attention, nevertheless the empiri- 
cal ego appears as subjectively colored, and as thus standing 
over against the object related with the empirical ego, to 
which is attached a very marked measure of objectivity. 
Sec. 2. Marked manifoldness and lack of realness have 
been found in an earlier chapter to vary directly. It is 
apparent therefore that in thus identifying the object-subject 
relation with the relation between a partial presentation which 
displays marked realness, and a presentative field in which 
marked manifoldness is developed we are practically asserting 
that a state of relative unrealness attaches to the field of in- 
attention,—i.e. to the Self, so far as this is presentatively given 
in the empirical ego which is a simulacrum of the Self. 
This at first sight does not seem clearly true, for the empirical 
ego when considered in itself seems usually most real. But 
when we attribute unrealness to the empirical ego we are not 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  348 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
dealing with cases where the empirical ego is considered in 
itself. Where the object-subject relation becomes explicit 
in cases of distinct self-consciousness, the empirical ego is 
not thus considered in itself ; and it is only under such con- 
ditions that we place the realness of the object in contra- 
distinction with the unrealness of the subject. This relative 
unrealness of the subject is to be sure usually implicit only ; 
but that it occasionally becomes explicit is seen in the fact 
that in every day discourse we have come to use the word 
“subjective” as the equivalent of “‘ merely imaginary” and 
“unreal.” When, for instance, the moon rising on the 
horizon seems enormously large in relation to its usual appear- 
ance we appreciate that this apparent change of size is unreal, 
and we ascribe the illusion at once to some “subjective” 
interpretation, the characteristic of relative unrealness being 
thus implicitly attached to the subject or empirical ego.1 
II 
Sec. 3. It appears thus that we have in the object- 
subject relation the appreciation of a combinational sense of 
relation due to the coincident effectiveness of the realness 
and manifoldness senses of relation. 
If where the object-subject relation is distinctly marked 
the presentative field consists of a relatively broad field within 
which some special part displays an emphatic realness which 
contrasts with the less marked realness of the rest of the 
field: then evidently without the existence of this broader 
field of low degree of emphasis the object-subject relation 
cannot exist. A relatively simple and very real elementary 
psychic emphasis might exist as such, but unless the broader 
field of less emphasis to which it can be related also exists 
the object-subject relation cannot be given as a presentation. 
1Confer Book 11. Appendix B, Sec. 7 for a fuller consideration of this 
point. 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
    REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 349 
Thus it is that in a large proportion of moments of experience, 
when our presentations are those of vivid intensity due to 
stimulation from our environment and are exceedingly real, 
the object-subject relation is not appreciated at all : conscious- 
ness seems to be but a succession of marked presentations: 
e.g. this running horse, the man in the road, the shriek of 
some other man, the leap of the man in danger. 
On the other hand in all situations that we are able to 
study with care in reflection the broad field does exist, and 
more or less explicitly the object-subject relation appears. 
Sec. 4. Assuming then the existence of a more or less 
broad field of less emphatic presentations we may now 
consider the conditions which favor the appearance of the 
specially real psychic element which is brought into relation 
with this broader field ; and here we shall find, as we should 
expect to find, a correspondence with the conditions of the 
appearance of attention as the result of the extreme emphasis 
of an intensity, as referred to in Chapter x1v. 
The appearance of the object-subject relation may be deter- 
mined by a stimulus from the environment. A brilliant 
light, a powerful sound, a stinging pain, all of which become 
emphatic and very real, tend in our wide awake states to 
appear as objective to us when we find ourselves aware of 
their relation to our ‘‘selves.” ‘‘ Recurrent” presentations 
as we have seen also tend to become very real, and they like- 
wise tend to be objectified.* 
But, as we have seen in Chapter x1v. that the action of the 
psychic system must always in some degree influence the 
1 Confer my Address in the Department of Aesthetics; St. Louis Con- 
gress of Arts and Sciences, vol. i. Our standards of Beauty, Goodness, 
and Validity or Truth, are gained by a sort of sublimation of our 
appreciation of the realness within the great groups of our presentations, 
impressional, reactive, and coordinative respectively ; and, as we know, an 
objective qualification is attributed to them not only by philosophers of 
the Platonic type, but by the common man who refuses to believe that 
no objective standards of the True, the Good, and the Beautiful exist.
-P-A-G-E-364
  350 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
nature of attention, so we should hold that it must always in 
some measure influence the object-subject relation through its 
influence upon presentative stability or realness. This in- 
fluence may be more or less explicit, and in certain cases may 
be entirely overlooked, as is especially the case where impres- 
sions reaching us from the environment are powerful. Thus 
it happens that sensational-perceptual presentations gain an 
objectiveness that seems quite independent of ourselves, just 
as the attention given to them seems to be forced upon us. 
Objects in the outer world for instance are given in a series 
of presentations which are characterized by this special degree 
of realness which leads us to overlook the influence of the 
psychic system so completely that our concept of the objective 
world comes to have as part of its connotation the qualification 
that the object-in-the-outer-world presentations have a real- 
ness quite independent of ourselves. 
But we have seen that there is no case in which some 
measure of influence of the system upon the nature of the 
presentation does not exist; and if we consider the matter 
with care we find that in many cases, where at first the realness 
of the object seems quite independent of our attitude towards 
it, we are able to recognize that the realness and objectiveness, 
although primarily arising directly or indirectly as the result 
of stimuli reaching us from the environment, is due almost 
entirely to the preparedness of the psychic system, almost 
entirely to the existence of “‘ psychical dispositions.” 
Ill 
Sec. 5. This determination of the rise of the object- 
subject relation, through an added realness given to the 
emphatic presentation as the result of psychic assimilation, 
is so important a matter that I emphasize it by treating it 
here in a separate division of this chapter. 
As assimilation by the whole psychic system maintains the
-P-A-G-E-365
  REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 351 
intensity of a given partial presentation and thus gives us 
the self-conscious direction of attention by the empirical ego 
in what we call voluntary attention: so the assimilation of a 
given presentation by the whole psychic system might be 
expected to maintain the realness of a given partial presenta- 
tion and give us the self-conscious direction by the empirical 
ego of the object-subject relation. 
As consciousness in any moment is a vastly complex system 
of minor psychic systems in which thoroughgoing reciprocal 
reactions between the elementary parts always prevail, it is 
clear not only that the realness of a given presentation must 
always affect the broad psychic field in which manifoldness 
‘is preeminent, i.e. the field of inattention, i.e. the Self ; but 
also on the other hand that the realness of a given presen- 
tation must always be affected by the nature of this field 
of inattention, the Self. We must expect then to find our- 
selves appreciating the rise out of this field of inattention of 
an influence which affects the realness of any given presenta- 
tion. If the given presentation assimilates with the noetic 
pattern developed within the body of the psychic system, then 
this presentation will tend to gain stability—to gain real- 
ness; if, on the other hand it does not thus assimilate with 
the noetic pattern developed within the body of the psychic 
system, then it will tend to lose its stability,—will tend to 
lose realness. 
Of the efficiency of the non-presentable Self in relation to 
realness and its resultant objectiveness we speak in Book 111. 
But here we cannot but take cognizance of the fact that 
whenever a presentation is given in which appears a mass of 
this broad psychic system to which a psychic increment so to 
speak accrues, then we have the experience of an empirical 
ego with which the object is contrasted: and it would seem 
clear that when this action of the Self is explicit we must 
experience the action of the simulacrum of the Self, i.e. of 
the empirical ego, upon the realness of a presentation, which 
   
-P-A-G-E-366
ee er nn ee 
352 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
when explicit and clear we should expect to yield an experi- 
ence of a special state in which we recognize this action of the 
empirical ego as effective in establishing this realness and its 
resultant objectiveness. This state is what we call Belief. 
In the act of belief, the realness of a presentation being 
established the presentation gains a distinct objectiveness as 
it stands in contradistinction from the subject to which it 
appeals. When I say I believe I mean to say that this or 
that is real for me. Belief thus may be defined as the recog- 
nition of the objective realness of a special presentation, in 
conjunction with the realization that this realness results from 
the reaction of the mass of the psychic system upon the 
presentation, this realness being thus established because the 
presentation assimilates with the noetic pattern existing at 
the moment in the mass of the system. We thus find quite 
natural the fact that this recognition of realness in belief, 
whenever it is in any measure clear, leads to the every day 
assertion that the state of belief is closely related to the 
empirical ego, and in fact comes from it: for when belief is 
clear we are always led to say I believe this, i.e. 1 recognize 
this to be real. 
The reader will recall that in the preceding chapter we 
showed that all attention is conative ; although this conative 
aspect of attention becomes explicit only in special cases of 
clear self-consciousness which we describe as voluntary atten- 
tion. So we are prepared to note that all established realness 
in the object-subject relation has a conative connotation, the 
realness of the presentation being always determined to some 
extent by the action of the Self, which however is often quite 
implicit ; only when it becomes explicit do we gain a clear   
1It is to be noted that certain psychologists use the word Judgment as I 
would use Belief. Brentano thus used the word, and Dr. G. F. Stout has 
followed him (confer his Analytical Psychohgy, 1, p. 97). He speaks of this 
experience as the “yes-no consciousness.” Judgment in my view is best 
considered as a special type of belief.
-P-A-G-E-367
  
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 353 
case of self-consciousness in which the conative aspect of the 
empirical ego appears as determining the realness of its 
object ; then we experience the will act; then we will and 
believe. 
Sec. 6. No one, I think, who examines his inner life with 
care can fail to notice how constantly and persistently his 
empirical ego is bound up with, and appears to enforce the 
realness of, objects which are readily assimilable, and is 
appreciated as discouraging the realness of those which are 
not readily assimilable. But this influence of the empirical 
ego in establishing the stability,—the realness,—of the object 
becomes most clear when in relation with the empirical ego 
appear two objects the complete realness of one of which is 
incompatible with the complete realness of the other, both 
of which however persist for a more or less prolonged period 
in attention, i.e. have a relative stability or realness, because 
both are in part assimilated, and yet neither fully assimilated. 
Then finally we find ourselves emphasizing the realness of 
one of the incompatibles and asserting our belief that one‘of 
the two is true or real, and that the other is false or unreal. 
In such cases the empirical ego is distinctly experienced as 
active in establishing the realness of the one of the two in- 
compatible objects with which it most fully assimilates; we 
distinctly appreciate that we believe in what seems to us most 
in harmony with our every day selves, i.e. with our empirical 
egos. 
Thus in all cases of belief the process is the same, and it 
consists in the appearance from within the empirical ego of 
some influence which constrains us to resolve in some one 
direction the appreciated opposition. It is from within the 
empirical ego that proceeds the power to take that active part 
in the process which Dr. James speaks of as ‘‘loading the 
dice,” so far as this is apprehended. 
As John Stuart Mill* says, the elder Mill uses the word 
1 Analysis of the Human Mind, vol. i. p. 343 notec 
Zz
-P-A-G-E-368
354 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
‘ belief to cover ‘“‘every species of conviction or assurance.” 
Later writers however, like Hamilton and Bain, properly 
restrict the term, as the common man does, “‘to those cases 
of conviction which are short of direct intuition.” 
In a sense it may well be held, as James Sully says,’ that 
belief is ‘‘a perfectly simple mental state having a unique 
character of its own.” Prof. James also tells® us that “in its 
  1 Outlines of Psycholgy, p. 398. For the common man, as Sully says 
(Human Mind, i. p. 501), “belief is blind: knowledge is clear sighted. 
Belief is instinctive, a matter of feeling: knowledge is carefully reasoned 
out and seems inevitable or necessary.” We must hold however that this 
is a description of an opposition obtaining between cases where belief and 
knowledge are respectively very distinct as such. 
That marked cases of belief have an emotional tinge must be acknow- 
ledged, and it is also true that marked cases of what we call knowledge 
lack this emotional tinge. ‘That marked cases of belief lack the clear cut 
differentiations which belong to knowledge is also certain. But if our view 
as to the nature of belief be correct every “intellectual act” must involve 
some measure of belief, although it may not be recognized as such, inasmuch 
as every assertion of difference which is implicit in all intelligent activity 
involves some measure of opposition or doubt, and its resolution. It is true 
thus as Stout says (Analytical Psychology, i. 112) that “there is no thought 
without some kind and degree of judgment” (belief). Stout (0. cit. p. 98) 
while agreeing to “regard all ‘ knowing’ as ‘believing,’” does “not regard 
all believing as knowing,” and he proceeds to give us (0p. cit. pp. 101 f.), 
three types of “ floating ideas” in which neither affirmation nor negation,— 
no judgment,—no belief,—are concerned, viz. : “1. The state of doubt or 
suspense of judgment. 2, The play of fancy, or ‘ make believe.’ 3. Aesthetic 
contemplation without make believe, or with a minimum of make believe.” 
He is compelled to agree however (. cit. p. 107) that even in the 3rd 
class, which he thinks most clearly illustrates his view, “the distinction 
between simple apprehension and judgment . . . remains only a relative 
one.” And in this final view I would follow him. As there is no knowing 
without some measure of belief: so there is no belief,—no efficient action 
by the ego in establishing the realness of a presentation,—without such 
a resultant differentiation in consciousness as, when explicit, is called 
knowing. Cf. Helen Wodehouse, Mind, N.S. 67, p. 362, in agreement 
with my view. 
2 Psychology, ii. p. 283.. 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
  REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 355 
inner nature, belief, or the sense of reality (realness H.R.M.), 
is a sort of feeling more allied to the emotions than to any- 
thing else”; and Mr. Bagehot has distinctly called it the 
“emotion of conviction.” The fact that these important 
thinkers consider belief to be a type of emotion, which is a 
definite type of presentation, adds weight to the view that it 
is generally thought of as a special type of experience, such 
as would be given in the sense of relation arising in connec- 
tion with the explicit recognition of the firm realness attaching 
to the given objective presentation. 
If with Miss Calkins? we content ourselves with saying 
that ‘‘ belief is an idea which contains the feeling of realness, 
and which refers to another idea or an event,” we miss, in my 
view, the distinctive characteristic of belief. There are many 
ideas qualified by this “‘ feeling of realness,” and referring to 
other ideas or events, which cannot be said to be beliefs. 
The fact that the sun is now setting involves a presentation 
with these attributes, but it cannot be said to be a belief of 
mine,-—its realness even if explicit is not thought of as in 
the least due to my own influence. Let me however question 
whether the dim light may be due to clouds in the sky instead 
of to the lateness of the hour, and then the realness becomes 
explicit through the influence of the empirical ego, then I 
decide and find myself believing that it is due to the setting of 
the sun. Until the existence of these states of stability is 
apprehended cognitively, and affirmed, we cannot truly say 
that we believe. Judgment is a phenomenon of cognition, 
and belief necessarily implies judgment. 
It is clear from the above definitions that the relation 
between belief and “‘feeling” and “emotion” is intimate. 
But what do these writers mean by ‘‘feeling” and what by 
“emotion”? I take it that they here mean by ‘‘emotion” 
something almost identical with “ feeling,” and I think that 
all will agree that by “feeling” they mean something that is 
1 Introduction to Psychology, p. 304.
-P-A-G-E-370
  356 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
distinctly subjective, as we say,—that is something distinctly 
concerned with the empirical ego. In fact as we shall see in 
Chapter xx11. what is usually called “ feeling” is nothing 
other than the recognition of the psychic system, as differ- 
entiated from its presentations, in a less explicit form than 
that which we designate as the empirical ego. It is clear 
then that in these definitions of belief in terms of “ feeling,” 
we have an acknowledgment of the fact that the empirical 
ego is always implicated in belief. 
Sec. 7. We have already noted in Chapter x. that the 
realness of a noetic emphasis where thorough and persistent 
is usually overlooked. Only where there occur incompatible 
emphases does the question of the realness of either of the 
two incompatibles occupy attention: and here the develop- 
ment, as stable or real, of either of the incompatibles is at 
once inhibited by the other, giving us the state of doubt. 
This doubt may be aroused by the merest momentary 
questioning and may instantly disappear as the realness of 
one of the incompatibles overwhelms all opposition: or the 
doubt may persist for a considerable period and be finally 
replaced by the stable development of one of the incom- 
patibles. But the recognition of the establishment of this 
realness, which constitutes the state of belief, never appears 
except as following the deadlock of a state of doubt, even 
though this doubt exist but a moment. 
The break down of this doubt may be due to a gain in the 
inner efficiency of one of the two incompatible emphases ;— 
perhaps e.g. some new favorable argument appears to uphold 
one position as against the other ;—or some elusive influence 
from the Self, of which we speak in Book m1., appears to 
produce the same result. In such cases the prevailing em- 
phasis becomes so important in itself that no sense of the 
efficiency of the empirical ego of self-consciousness is given, 
and in such cases we cannot be said to believe at all. 
Belief is noted only where the deadlock of doubt is con-
-P-A-G-E-371
  REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 357 
tinuous for some measurable time. In such cases the period 
of doubt persists without any gain of inner efficiency by 
either of the incompatibles; both seem equally forced upon 
us for the time. Then the doubt remains until it is resolved 
in a clearly self-conscious state, when the influence of the 
empirical ego breaks the deadlock and I say ‘I believe.” 
Sec. 8. Probably no psychologist will raise question as 
to the first point made above, viz. that belief involves the 
establishment of realness. Nor is it probable that any one 
after serious thought will question the correctness of the 
statement just made as a second point, viz. that this estab- 
lishment of realness in belief necessarily follows doubt. 
There is however so great a lack of clear discrimination in 
thought and writing in reference to this subject that we 
must consider this latter point more at length. Prof. James! 
says “any object which remains uncontradicted is ipso facto 
believed and posited as absolute reality ;” and this certainly 
might be taken to mean that he considers that belief is not 
necessarily the resolution of doubt. But in thus speaking 
Prof. James seems to fall into the mode of speech of every 
day life in which we are wont to fail to make discriminations 
which are very necessary for the psychologist. Evidently 
here he uses the word belief, as the common man often does, 
in a broad way to describe, not the subjective state of belief, 
but rather an objectively observed state which is a condition 
of belief, but which as observed is a conception and not 
properly speaking a belief at all. For belief as psychologists 
use the term is surely descriptive of a subjective, and not of 
an objective, experience. We indeed often use the term some- 
what objectively without impropriety when speaking of the 
subjective states of belief in other men, or in ourselves at 
other times than the present: but surely we speak quite im- 
properly if we extend this objective use of the term to cover 
1 Psychology, ii. p. 288. Confer for certain remarks concerning Prof. 
James’ use of the word reality, Chapter x. Sec. 4, footnote.
-P-A-G-E-372
  358 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP IL 
cases where there is no subjective experience of belief at all. 
We fall into this error if, as the common man often does, we 
speak of one as having a given belief just because he acts as 
he would if he had the subjective experience of belief. Just 
because a given presentation has intrinsic realness we know 
by experience that if this realness is questioned belief will be 
aroused: but this intrinsic realness does not constitute the 
subjective experience a belief: it is but the condition pre- 
requisite to the appearance of belief if other conditions super- 
vene. We are wont to say thus that the common man 
believes in the reality of objects in the outer world, and this 
because he acts as he would if he entertained such a belief : 
but in fact nothing is clearer than that the average thought- 
less man knows nothing whatever of such a belief ; he is in 
fact hardly able to comprehend what the psychologist means 
when he distinguishes between the subjective and the 
objective, and is entirely incapable of understanding the 
significance of the ontological questions with which the meta- 
physician concerns himself. 
It is thus I think that Prof. James must use his terms in 
the passage above quoted, for in my view nothing can be 
more certain than that ‘‘any object which remains uncon- 
tradicted” fails altogether to arouse belief just in so far as its 
realness is not questioned and fails of recognition. Not until 
it is thus questioned can it be believed or posited as real. 
Sec. 9. These observations prove to be of value when 
we turn to our final statement ; viz. that, given the doubt, the 
efficiency of the empirical ego in establishing the Sane of 
one of the two incompatibles is always involved when we 
experience belief. The opposition to the acceptance of this 
view comes from those who think of an established realness 
as itself constituting belief. This established realness as we 
have just seen, does in truth constitute a condition which is 
almost certain to be followed by belief if question is aroused ; 
but it does not constitute the belief itself. The condition
-P-A-G-E-373
  
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 359 
of established realness is largely determined by inheritance, 
by tradition, and by custom: and misusing the term belief 
in the manner above described the common man is wont to 
say that a large part of our beliefs are determined by inherit- 
ance, tradition, or custom; and not by any action of the 
empirical ego; i.e. that they are forced upon us. But the 
most that we are warranted in holding is that our actual beliefs 
are in large measure conditioned by influences which con- 
strain us from without. Inheritance, tradition, custom, are 
as definitely extraneous influences as are the direct stimula- 
tions from the environment ; and while it is clear that these 
extraneous influences must have much to do with the deter- 
mination of that realness of presentations which conditions 
belief, it is equally clear that they are not of the essence of 
the belief itself. 
Definite tendencies are produced by inheritance, by experi- 
ence of tradition and custom: but not until doubt either 
explicit or implicit is raised do we ever believe; and then 
out of the field of inattention when the belief is implicit, from 
the ego of experience when the belief is explicit, arises the 
influence which settles the doubt, and leads us to adopt the 
attitude which we express when we say ‘‘we believe.” This 
action of the empirical ego in the welcome of one and the 
rejection of another of two incompatibles is as we have seen 
an “‘act of will,” and it thus appears again that whenever we 
believe a volitional act is involved.? 
Sec. 10. There are cases where the act of will in belief 
enforces for the moment the realness of one of two incom- 
patible objects, but where the realness of this object cannot be 
maintained,—where the realness of the other incompatible 
becomes fixed by causes extrinsic to the nature of the noetic 
pattern of the moment. In such cases the object which finally 
1 As Dr. Walter Smith well says (Philosophical Review, ii. p. 675) : “ Be- 
liefs are only irresistible when they cannot be described as beliefs, but are 
necessary developments of conceptions already held.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  360 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
becomes real becomes so notwithstanding the first moment’s 
choice by the empirical ego. The belief of the first moment 
is, after the fact, overridden. In successive experiences a new 
empirical ego may come to accept the realness of the object 
before rejected ; and we, as we review a long series of states 
of consciousness, then experience belief which appears to 
have been forced upon us. We thus gain a concept of an 
empirical ego which is impotent to establish the realness of 
an object which it would have established had its nature as it 
existed in the first instance remained unchanged and perma- 
nently effective. It is this experience in the main which 
leads the opponents of the view here defended to overlook the 
truth in the case. 
This then is the point here emphasized. Whatever condi- 
tions may arouse the realness of incompatible presentations, 
the subjective experience which we call belief never accrues 
except as the result of an experienced welcome of the realness 
of the one, and rejection of the realness of the other, of two 
incompatibles by the empirical ego; and such an action of 
the empirical ego is in itself a voluntary act. And thus 
it is that whenever we recognize the fact that we are believing, 
we will to break the deadlock of doubt. 
1It has also led men of authority to uphold the view that independence 
of the will is the criterion of belief in reality. (Confer Robertson, Mind, 
51 and 53 and 61 ; and Stout, Mind, 57; and Baldwin, Mind, 63.) It 
is doubtless true that opposition to the will goes a great way to call our 
attention to the realness of certain presentations which we call “ objects 
in the outer world”; but the realness as thus established is in a 
different realm from that of the will experiences which had to do with 
its arousal. 
2Tt seems best here to point out that this view is apparently opposed to 
the view of Dr. G. F. Stout where he states (Analytical Psychology, ii. p. 239) 
that “wherever belief or judgment exists, it involves the control of our 
activity as thinking beings by conditions which are fixed for us and not by 
us. In so far as we are left free to think otherwise than we do think, 
belief is absent.” He admits (p, 258) that there are difficulties in connec- 
tion with this particular statement, but holds that when rightly considered 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 361 
Sec. 11. An interesting corroboration of the view here 
maintained has been brought to my attention by Prof. B. L. 
Gildersleeve in connection with his studies in Greek Syntax. 
The Greeks, whose language so accurately mirrored their 
mental states, made use of two negatives, one of which was 
used exclusively with verbs of creation, will, and endeavor. 
Prof. Gildersleeve has noted that the will negative is always 
used in connection with verbs relating to belief. In his own 
language, quoted from a private letter, ‘“‘belief . . . is 
these difficulties disappear entirely. I am inclined to think that this 
apparent opposition to my position is rather verbal than real. 
In one sense it is true that “in so far as we are left free to think other- 
wise than we do think, belief is absent :” that is, at moments when we 
experience a sense of freedom to accept the realness of either of two incom- 
patibles, the empirical ego has not determined |the realness of either of the 
two, and belief does not exist. It is also true that the Self is part of the 
whole psychic system, and that if it be held that the nature of the whole 
psychic system is determined for us and not by us, then it is correct to say 
that each of our states, inclusive of belief, “involves the control of our 
activity as thinking beings by conditions which are fixed for us and not by 
us.” On the other hand it seems to me contrary to all our experience to 
state that when I believe I experience a control of my activity, as a thinking 
being, by conditions which are fixed for me and not by me. And it is this 
state of my experience with which I am here concerned. 
I feel confident that Mr. Stout’s statement of his view is involved with 
objective considerations, and with a metaphysical theory of the nature of 
the Universe, which have nothing to do with our present contention. He 
states in his Manual of Psychology (pp. 549 ff.) “ Objective coercion is of the 
very essence of belief. Whatever influence subjective needs as such may 
have in determining belief, they can never be the sole factor.” I do not 
disagree with this view: but I would say that the “ objective coercion” is 
in truth a condition without which belief cannot exist, but that belief 
consists just in the overruling of this coercion. He says further (p. 55), 
“There are two factors then which cooperate in the formation of belief, one 
subjective and the other objective. Neither of these factors is sufficient by 
itself ; both must be operative.” (Italics mine.) In view of such a statement 
it seems to me unfortunate that he should have made the statement in 
his Analytical Psychology first referred to, in the form there used, for it 
seems to give a wrong impression of his real view.  
-P-A-G-E-376
362 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
originally forth-putting of the will. The negative is the 
negative of the will... The negative in Greek after 
verbs of belief is so steadily the negative of the will, that 
when we find the other negative we feel that the belief has 
faded out.” 
It is interesting further to note that, if this view is correct, 
voluntary decision itself must be bound up with belief : the 
very action of the empirical ego in voluntarily holding a given 
presentation in attention must tend to be bound up with the 
voluntary enforcement of the realness of the presentation. 
This fact we find Stout expressing where he says’ “‘ the mental 
attitude of voluntary decision is distinguished by the de- 
pendence of the act upon the Jelief that we are going to 
perform it.” 
Sec. 12. Here again we see clearly the essential unity of 
the process in fields of ideation and impulse referred to above. 
If the will-act where one of two conflicting impulses is 
emphasized seems dissimilar to that experienced in the cases 
above described it is merely because the objects upon which 
the empirical ego acts themselves differ, in the one case being 
impulsive and in the other ideational, the process of will 
action in each case remaining the same. Willing in relation 
to bodily acts is more common than willing in belief, in the 
experience of the ordinary man who does not stop to weigh 
motive or to relate thoughts ; and in fact even in the average 
experience of the contemplative man. But the contemplative 
man finds often that the willing to do is of less import in his 
life than the willing involved in belief. The empirical ego 
in his case often resolves doubts, i.e. induces beliefs ; which 
lead to acts involving no appearance in attention of the 
decision to emphasize one of two conflicting impulses. If 
the action of such a man is arrested for a considerable time 
however, the conflicting impulses appear in attention just as 
they do for the man of uncontemplative habit, and as they

-P-A-G-E-377
  
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 363 
do in himself in his uncontemplative moods. The most that 
the contemplative man can say is that if he examines his will- 
acts with care he finds with Dr. Stout} “‘ that it is the cognitive 
side of our nature which gives determinate character to the 
conative.” 
Sec. 13. It may be well here to consider for a moment the 
specific problem set by Prof. James in his Wil) to Believe. 
In his Psychology he teaches the essential connection between 
Belief and Will, going so far as to say®* that they “‘are two 
names for one and the same psychological phenomenon.” In 
the essay here under consideration he turns to the special 
problem as to our justification for the determination of special 
beliefs, using the word belief to describe objective situations 
and not the subjective situation here considered. This has 
aroused a storm of objection from many psychologists who 
claim that such a doctrine is scientifically immoral : who ask 
“can we make a thing true by our wish to have it so? Have 
we a right to accept a belief because we like it, when the 
evidence of its groundlessness is before us?” 
The unfortunate use of the word belief with two meanings 
has led to much obscurity in this discussion ; for it appears 
that we have before us here two separate matters which ‘if 
correctly stated are found to be not contradictory, and which 
our previous considerations put us in a position to explain 
satisfactorily. The matter referred to at the close of the 
preceding paragraph involves an ethical question which can- 
not be discussed here. The other matter however involves 
1 Mind, N.S. 19, p. 356. (Italics mine.) 
2'There has been much discussion of this subject in late years by able 
psychologists, opened up by Professor James’ essays. Dr. Dickinson S. 
Miller opposed James’ view in an article in the Journal of Ethics and I was 
led to answer him in the issue of April, 1899. The positions there main- 
tained are practically those which I present in the following pages. 
5 Psychology, ii. p. 321. 
4 Confer however my article in Jnternational Journal of Ethics, April, 1899.
-P-A-G-E-378
  364 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
a distinctly psychological question which we are bound to 
face. 
Under our view beliefs are necessarily self-determined, in 
the sense that the empirical ego is always implicated when we 
believe. This indeed does not appear to me to be in the least 
a question of controversy. We may not like to acknowledge 
it, because perchance we prefer to free ourselves from respon- 
sibility which really belongs to us. But whether we like it 
or not is not the question: and those who recoil from the 
acceptance of this fact, and refuse to believe it, are in that 
very act ‘‘ willing to believe” in its opposite, notwithstanding 
the evidence which opposes their position. 
I cannot but think that the argument here again is clouded 
often by the failure of the contestants to distinguish verbally, 
and in thought, between reality and realness of which I have 
already spoken. The appreciation of such a presentation as 
a ‘‘reality” has nothing whatever to do with the problem of 
“belief and will.’ Of course I cannot by my own act make 
a reality any more than I can make any other presentation. . 
Of course I cannot make a universe different from what it is, 
i.e. create a new reality, just because I happen to wish the 
universe were different, and because I think better conse- 
quences would result if it were different. As F. H. Bradley 
says (Mind, N.S. 44, pp. 440 f.) “If by your volition you 
have, for instance, produced truth and knowledge in yourself, 
you may by a legitimate abstraction neglect the aspect of its 
appearance in you, and so take the truth merely as being such 
and such in itself. But if while still maintaining this abstrac- 
tion, you attributed the resulting truth to your will—you 
would have fallen into a very serious confusion and mistake. 
At least for psychology the will to know cannot alter the real 
object known, and it cannot, in other words, make truth. 
Your will to know alters your actual existence, and with that 
comes a changed appearance of the object in you, but the 
object itself is not thereby changed. The truth in belief
-P-A-G-E-379
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 365 
has two aspects . . . and it is only one of these aspects which 
can be produced by your will. The ideal qualification of 
the object has been a real change, but it has not, at least for 
psychology, altered the object as existing.” * 
In answer to the question of our opponents as given in the 
opening paragraph of this section we would then say: you 
cannot make a truth by an act of your will; but you can, 
and do, make objects real by your acts of will in believing. 
How far you are warranted in believing thus in special ways 
is an ethical question and is, as I have said above, apart from 
the subject treated in this work. 
B. ATTENTION AND THE Oxyject-SupjecT RELATION 
Sec. 14. If in attention the relation of intensity to mani- 
foldness is given; and if in the object-subject relation the 
relation of realness to manifoldness is given; and if degrees 
of intensity and of realness tend to vary directly; then 
evidently where attention is given we have the conditions 
which will be likely to bring into prominence the object- 
subject relation; and where the object-subject relation is 
given we have the conditions which will be likely to bring 
attention into prominence. Where attention is very marked 
as such, it is because a special ‘‘ sense-of-relation” presenta- 
tion is given; and the same is true where the object-subject 
relation as such is very marked. It is evident of course that 
attention and the object-subject relation as such are not likely 
to be emphasized at the same moment. On the other hand 
we shall expect to note (4) that where attention in a given 
direction is so marked that we consider it in itself, the pre- 
sentation attended to will in future moments be likely to 
1] may add that I find myself in the main in agreement with Bradley in 
his criticism of James’ use of terms. Confer Mind, N.S. 46, pp. 157 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  366 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP IL 
have its realness emphasized in becoming objective in the 
object-subject contrast. So also we shall expect to note 
(B) that where the objective aspect of a given presentation 
is so marked that we consider it in itself, the presentation 
thus objectified will iz future moments be likely to have 
its intensity emphasized in becoming the focus of a state of 
attention. 
Sec. 15. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the second point 
just made, for it is clear in the fact that objects so usually 
come within the focus of attention that we actually most fre- 
quently speak of the presentation which is within the focus as 
the object of attention. It may be well however to say a 
few words in relation to the first point. 
While it is true that attention does not necessarily involve 
the realness of the presentation attended to, in any other 
than the narrow sense of realness which applies to mere 
experience as such, it is evident that persistence of attention 
to a given presentation must involve a tendency to the 
creation of a fuller stability and a fuller sense of realness in 
connection with the presentation which will have its effect in 
future moments. 
That attention which is forced upon us from without tends 
to produce an appreciation of objectivity in connection with 
the presentation attended to, is clear in the fact that our sense 
perceptions give us such firm convictions of the existence of 
objective realities. But it is equally clear that attention 
which is distinctly voluntary, i.e. which is maintained from 
within the psychic system, tends to give objective reality to 
the presentation attended to. Of this we have marked 
examples in cases of self-sophistication where the objective- 
ness gained is evidently artificial. When we wish a situation 
to be objectively real, we may actually find it becoming objec- 
tively real if we persistently maintain an attitude of attention 
in relation to it. By dwelling upon the arguments which we 
wish to have become effective we obliterate the force of
-P-A-G-E-381
    REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 367 
counter arguments which would normally tend to render our 
chosen view untenable.? 
1 The sharp cut cases of attention which is forced upon us from without 
naturally shade off into those cases where attention is forced upon us from 
within the psychic system in voluntary attention: and the corresponding 
establishment of objectiveness is noted in connection with them. 
In hallucinations we have cases where objectiveness is due to attention 
which is not under the full control of the psychic system, and which could 
not exist if the control of the system were complete. Hallucinations are 
usually thought of by us as experiences only of the insane; but this can 
only be maintained if we hold that all normal men are at times insane, 
notably in their dream life: for, as Prof. Royce (Outlines of Psychology, p. 355) 
has pointed out, what we in waking life call hallucinations occur normally 
in our dreams. Hallucinations are presentations which are distinct in atten- 
tion, they are true percepts which at the same time gain so much realness 
that they are falsely judged to be due to such objective conditions as usually 
yield percepts; and this false judgment merely means that the full conscious 
system in such cases is not completely in control as it is in normal life, for 
then this false judgment is not made, The insane man is one whose full 
conscious system either for a time fails to control his field of attention, or 
one whose conscious system is permanently disorganized. We in our 
dreams are men whose full conscious systems fail to control the field of 
attention; and our dreams show the result in the objective realness of 
presentations which could not for a moment hold in moments of wakeful- 
ness. d 
But as we should expect, we find the hallucinatory presentations of dream 
life, with the objectivity attached to them, fading off into states which are 
common to the wide awake life. These latter states give us what we speak 
of as the realm of Fancy. We let our thoughts play, and objectivity is 
attached to all the presentations that are given without relation to the fact 
that were our Selves in full control the realness would depart from them. 
From states of Fancy we step to those of Imagination where the control 
of the whole psychic system is more complete. In such moods we conceive 
e.g. of the mermaid and the unicorn, and picture to ourselves the experiences 
of Alice in the Looking Glass. 
Taking one step further we have what we call, when speaking objectively, 
the “constructive imagination,” in which objective realness is for the 
moment given to the presentation acknowledgedly by the action of the 
empirical ego. And from this we step quite naturally to the world of 
“make believe” where the Self, as explicit in the empirical ego, very 
distinctly steps in, and for its own purposes casts off its usual criteria, and
-P-A-G-E-382
  368 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
Artificially induced impressional influences which force 
attention by their repetition act in a similar manner. The 
reiteration of the spiritualist medium’s fraudulent illustra- 
tions make the common man accept the objective reality of 
“ghosts” ; and the reiterated claim that the phenomena upon 
which the ghost hypothesis rests are inexplicable except upon 
the hypothesis of spirit control has led many men of sound 
mind to attach much more of realness to these appearances, 
and to the hypotheses connected with them, than is warranted 
by the given facts. 
The pedagogical importance of this reiteration of enforced 
attention in producing an appreciation of objective reality is 
readily seen: by such means we learn for instance to look 
upon geometrical relations as objectively real, which naturally 
would not for a moment be thought of in this way. Atten- 
tion which is recurrently forced upon us from within has the 
same effect, and usually a more powerful effect, as is noted 
in the efforts of wise teachers to induce their pupils to attain 
a habit of learning by means of voluntary attention. 
Sec. 16. A presentation which will not assimilate with 
(will not become real in relation to) the whole system, may 
yet as the result of persistent attention become real in relation 
to an important partial system, with the result that there 
occurs a breaking up as it were of the whole system into parts. 
We have, for instance, the familiar attitude of the scientist 
who is an ardent Roman Catholic. In general he believes 
thoroughly in the realness of the dogma of the infallibility 
of the Pope, and that Christ was born of a Virgin, as objective 
realities ; but in a certain mood which is induced by artificial 
attention he may assert the realness of doctrines of modern 
makes real and objective for itself the presentations to which it attends, 
although in normal practical life it would refuse to do so, We are thus 
able to hold in attention’as real, in a broad realm, presentations which we 
are fully aware are in their own nature wholly lacking in realness in all 
other senses than as mefe conscious experiences.
-P-A-G-E-383
  
REALNESS AND MANIFOLDNESS 369 
science which are thoroughly incompatible with these religious 
beliefs. In such a case the man’s consciousness is evidently 
split off into two incompatible apperceptive systems in the 
two moments. He becomes two personalities, with two sets 
of real presentations which do not clash, do not overthrow one 
another, just because they are not brought into relation. 
Though there be a bond of unity in the two personalities ; 
there is little if any bond between the systems in which the 
incompatible doctrines severally appear. 
Sec. 17. If attention and the object-subject relation vary 
together we must expect to find that as they become promi- 
nent in conjunction, so the appreciation of attention and the 
appreciation of the object-subject relation will disappear 
together. 
An elemental intensity of relatively high grade may occur, 
but the presentation which it qualifies will not be apprehended 
as forming the focus of attention provided this high degree 
of elemental intensity is thoroughly coordinated in all normal 
noetic patterns. This is the case with the ordinary ocular 
sensations, and even those given in the glare of noon tide. 
A similar situation is observed in relation to the object- 
subject relation. As we have seen in Chapter x. realness of 
high degree may be given, but its existence will not be 
appreciated if it is thoroughly established. So a fully real 
presentation will not be apprehended as distinctly objective 
provided the high degree of realness is thoroughly coordi- 
nated in all normal noetic patterns. We are not self- 
conscious, i.e. objectiveness is not given,—under conditions 
of life which are very usual. As any special activity in a 
part of a system becomes more thoroughly coordinated with 
the whole, it becomes more difficult to raise this special 
element into prominence in contrast with the activity of the 
system. Thus we should expect to find, as we certainly do 
find, that as realness becomes established it becomes less 
noticeable as such, and the presentation which it qualifies 
2A

  370 CORRELATION OF QUALITIES OF GROUP I. 
becomes less likely to be objectified: and coordinately we 
should expect these presentations to be less likely to become 
marked objects of attention. In such cases the object will not 
rise into the focus of attention in a form which leads us to the 
observation of its realness except as the result of an opposi- 
tion such as is involved in doubt: i.e. in such cases we must 
be aroused by doubt before we can apprehend the fact that 
we experience the objective realness ; and as we have already 
noted we must cast out our doubt by an act of will before 
we rest assured of this objective realness in the explicit act 
of belief.

Sec. 1. As we have seen, both Intensity and the Algedonic 
Quality are characteristics of an elemental nature: that is they 
would probably be found to inhere in the psychic element 
if it could be isolated. 
Pleasure involves the appearance in the neural element in 
dynamic form of energy which has been potential, and this 
necessarily implies a relatively high degree of activity in the 
organic part, which must correspond with a certain degree of 
intensity of the psychic element under consideration. Pain 
involves the action of a neural element which being ill 
nourished would be quiescent but for the fact that it is forced 
to act by powerful stimulation: it thus involves a relatively 
high degree of enforced activity in the organic part, which 
again involves a certain degree of intensity of the psychic 
element under consideration. 
In a general way therefore we may say that we should expect 
to find intensity bound up with pleasure and with pain: and 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
  372 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
this expectation is fulfilled. Our pleasures and pains are 
surely among the most emphatic parts of our conscious 
experience. 
Sec. 2. Introspection shows us however that the relation 
between the intensity of the elemental presentation and its 
algedonic quality is not a direct one. If we examine for 
instance the simplest experienced sensation and note its rela- 
tion to the attached pleasure-pain quality, we find that its 
continuously increasing intensity, or its continuous intensity 
which seems to remain unaltered,’ involves changes in the 
pleasure-pain quality attached to it, which do not correspond 
with the altered conditions of intensity. Wundt has very 
clearly expressed this relation in the figure which we repro- 
duce below, which it is to be especially noted is a symbolic 
representation of the facts of experience as tested by intro- 
spection, and which was devised by Wundt to express these 
facts without regard to any such theory concerning the 
physical basis of pleasure-pain as is here maintained. 
  yi Fic. 8. \ 
The diagram above, taken from his Physiologische Psycho- 
logie, i. p. 511 (3rd edition), explains the law graphically. 
1 Our previous study of Weber’s law teaches that continuous and apparently 
unaltered intensity involves a continuously increasing neural activity just as 
much as an apparently continuously increasing intensity does. 
 
-P-A-G-E-387
  PLEASURE-PAIN AND INTENSITY 373 
The horizontal line indicates the general ‘‘ threshold” of 
sensation and also of pleasure-pain. The solid-line curve 
indicates the rise of sensation according to what is known as 
“‘Weber’s law.” The rise of this curve above the horizontal 
indicates increase of sensational intensity. The dotted-line 
curve indicates the alteration of degree of pleasure and pain 
corresponding with increase of sensational intensity; all 
above the horizontal line indicating pleasure, all below indi- 
cating pain; the degree of pleasure and pain being repre- 
sented by distance from the horizontal. 
This expresses the facts as usually noted in relation to 
sensations which are the forms of presentation most easily 
observed under control. The same relations between in- 
creasing intensity and the algedonic quality are however also 
observable in all other than sensational presentations, 
although with them control of conditions largely fails us, 
and the tendency to shiftings of attention makes the 
observation of the facts somewhat difficult. 
When a presentation at first appears as such ‘‘above the 
threshold” it in that fact has a certain amount of intensity, 
and is to a certain extent pleasant. With the increase of the 
intensity, and usually also with what we call a mere continu- 
ance of the same intensity, the pleasure at first increases with 
relative rapidity until it reaches a maximum, then decreases 
with relative rapidity until it disappears. If the intensity is 
still further increased, or usually if what we call the same 
intensity is prolonged, pain appears, and rapidly increases 
until rather suddenly the pain disappears, as the presentation 
also disappears. 
The normal development of intense and persistent presen- 
tations through pleasure to pain is well illustrated by our 
experience involving the continuous exercise of a definite set 
of muscles, as in the felling of a tree by a vigorous man in 
1Confer my Pain, Pleasure and Aesthetics, pp. 241 ff. for a fuller considera- 
tion of the questions here involved.  
-P-A-G-E-388
374 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
good health. The muscular pleasure increases rapidly ; then 
declines rather rapidly, (although less rapidly than would 
happen but for the fact that the exercise increases the circula- 
tion which brings fresh nutriment to the active parts which 
tends to balance the loss of energy). But presently the 
pleasure ceases; we find we no longer exercise the muscles 
spontaneously ; pain begins to be felt ; and if the exercise is 
persisted in without rest this painfulness increases rapidly, 
until suddenly our capacity to continue the activities is lost ; 
there is a deadening of the muscular feelings, then finally a 
complete cessation of them, and at the same time the pain 
directly connected with them disappears; although pains of 
another sort, due to general exhaustion, may of course still 
persist. 
Sec. 3. The facts above considered furnish corroboration 
of the algedonic theory already presented. 
A. Under this hypothesis an increase of an elemental 
neural activity sufficient to raise its corresponding psychic 
element out of the psychic mass and into emphasis as a pre- 
sentation (‘‘above the threshold”) must usually involve the 
action of a nervous part in which some amount of surplus 
stored energy exists; for before its activity was increased it 
was relatively quiescent (as is shown by the fact that its 
psychic coincident was ‘‘ below the threshold,”) and in con- 
dition to absorb nourishment. ‘This surplus energy will then 
be transformed from potential to actual form immediately upon 
the demand for increased activity made upon the neural part 
by the stimulus. This means that the presentation under 
such conditions will first appear in pleasant phase as Wundt’s 
symbol indicates ; and that as intensity increases, or if high 
intensity appears as continuous, the pleasure will increase 
until a maximum is reached (when the surplus stored energy 
is used to the full), when it will very rapidly disappear (as the 
surplus of stored energy becomes rapidly exhausted). 
This is a mere statement in formal shape of the general 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
PLEASURE-PAIN AND INTENSITY 375 
experience of men; viz. that all specific pleasures are 
evanescent ;—that any attempt to keep permanently in mind 
a pleasant presentation as such is doomed to failure ;—that 
the presentation which begins by being pleasant, if persisting 
as practically ‘‘the same” presentation, rapidly carries us to 
a maximum of pleasure which then much more rapidly wanes 
until it disappears altogether. 
B. But if our hypothesis is warranted, a continuance of 
the presentation in emphasis as intense, after the transition 
point of indifference is reached, must involve an activity in an 
organic part which is not well prepared to act, and is only 
sustained by the forceful stimulation, and not by the natural 
use of surplus stored energy ; for if pleasure is not given this 
is because all this surplus has become exhausted. Such con- 
tinuance of the presentation in emphasis can therefore only 
obtain in correspondence with an overdraught upon the 
normal energy of the organic part, and this under our theory 
must involve pain: and this pain will increase rapidly, as the 
draught upon the resources of the neural element reduces 
rapidly its capacity to react, until the organic part loses all 
capacity to react, and ceases to react; the corresponding 
psychic emphasis or presentation being lost. That is to say, 
as Wundt’s symbol indicates, pain rapidly increases under 
such conditions until rather suddenly it disappears; and it 
disappears together with the presentation to which it was 
attached.’ 
We have a good example of this in the experience con- 
nected with the killing of the nerve of a tooth, as practised 
in modern dentistry. The irritants placed upon the nerve 
terminals rapidly increase the tooth sensations and the pain, 
until the pain becomes extraordinarily vivid. But presently 
1For an explanation of those exceptional cases where both the presenta- 
tion and its attached pain persist for unusually long periods, see my Pain, 
Pleasure and Aesthetics, p. 259. 1 would refer the reader in this connection 
to all the matter from p. 242 to p. 259 of that book.  
-P-A-G-E-390
  376 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
the pain very suddenly ceases altogether, as do all of the 
tooth nerve sensations ; for the nerve terminal is dead. 
This course most easily noted in the sensational realm 
appears through all regions of mental activity where the 
presentation in itself does not change appreciably. This lack 
of noticeable change in the nature of the presentation must 
be kept constantly in mind in such introspective examination 
as we are here making; for, automatically we tend to shift 
our field of attention as soon as pain begins to be felt: as we 
shall see later, our conscious system reaches out naturally 
toward new presentations which do not involve pain, unless 
there be a continuation of stimulation from without which 
compels the continued attention upon what we call the same 
presentation. This fact makes it difficult to trace the change 
of painful intensity in states not due to external stimuli which 
we are able to govern. 
Sec. 4. In this connection it is to be noted: 
C. That apart from certain very exceptional cases, presen- 
tations if painful do not become indifferent or pleasant, if 
their intensity continues or increases. 
c. A condition where stimuli exist of more energy than 
can be reacted to equivalently (pain), if continued, will not 
be followed by a condition where equivalence prevails (in- 
difference), or by a condition where the energy involved in 
the reaction is greater than that involved in the stimulus 
(pleasure) : for in such a case the excessive stimulus will use 
up all energy which otherwise might bring repair to the stimu- 
lated part, which only thus can regain its normal condition or 
store surplus energy. 
D. On the other hand, if a presentation is pleasant, con- 
tinuity or increase of intensity will eventually result in 
decrease of the pleasure, until indifference is reached, and is 
finally displaced by pain. 
d. When with given stimuli the reaction shows a potency 
more than equivalent to that of the stimulus (pleasure), and 
provided the stimuli are continued or increased, then the    
-P-A-G-E-391
  
PLEASURE-PAIN AND INTENSITY 377 
potency of the reaction will decrease as the surplus stored 
energy is used up, and then the incoming and outgoing 
energies will first gain equivalence cceete) and finally 
the relation will become one where the potency of the stimulus 
will be greater than that of the reaction (pain). 
Thus, in connection with continuance of intensity, pleasure 
in connection with a given presentation fades into pain, but 
pain never fades into pleasure. 
E. Reduction of the intensity of a given painful presenta- 
tion in all cases reduces the pain until it disappears, but it 
does not change the pain into pleasure,—this change from 
pain to. pleasure occurring only in case the presentation dis- 
appears for a considerable time from the field of attention. 
e. If the activity in a nervous part which has been subject 
to an overdraught (pain) is reduced, this overdraught will be 
reduced, and pain will decrease and will finally cease altogether 
(indifference). But this decrease does not give a surplus of 
stored force in the neural part involved (such as would be 
necessary to give pleasure); and no activity in the neural 
part will be able to show a use of surplus stored force unless 
for a time all marked action of the part ceases, giving the 
organic parts time to recuperate. 
F. Reduction of the intensity of a given pleasant presenta- 
tion also reduces the pleasure until it disappears ; but does not 
change the pleasure into pain. 
f. If the activity of a nervous part in which a surplus of 
stored energy is available is reduced, less of the surplus stored 
energy will be used (less pleasure will be given): but reduc- 
tion of activity will in no such case put the nervous parts 
into a condition of inefficiency which will yield pain. 
Sec. 5. Occasionally we experience slight active pains 
which disappear without charge of intensity in the presenta- 
tion to which they are attached, and may even give place to 
pleasures of low degree without perceptible reduction of the 
stimulus: ‘‘we get used to the pain,” we say. But such 
cases of pain-reduction without reduction of the intensity 
of the presentation to which the pain is attached form the
-P-A-G-E-392
  378 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
exception which makes prominent the rule that we must 
decrease intensity if we are to decrease the painfulness of 
the given presentation. 
In terms of our neururgic theory we may explain these 
facts as follows. Where we “get used to pain” the con- 
ditions are similar to those producing the “second wind” of 
the athlete, which is evidently due to the starting up of activi- 
ties which bring to the wearied bodily parts an amount of 
nutrition in excess of the demand. Many methods in thera- 
peutics aim to break down acute pains by bringing additional 
nutritive supplies to the organic part affected, rather than 
by attempting to reduce the excessive stimulus reaching this 
organic part. Under such conditions moreover not only is 
the wearied neural part revived, but at times it may be 
placed in condition to react in higher degree than the 
stimulus demands, and in such exceptional cases pleasure 
is given. 
In general however we must decrease the force of the 
stimulus if we are to reduce the overdraught upon the neural 
element to which the pain is due. The reduction of the 
force of the stimulus may leave an equivalence between the 
incoming and the outgoing energies in the neural part 
involved (and then we have indifference) : but mere reduction 
of this force of stimulation cannot usually result in a use of 
surplus stored energy with pleasure, unless there is a period 
of rest from activity in the organ, during which recuperation 
occurs. 
Sec. 6. All, or at least a vast proportion of, the neural 
parts have some capacity for storage, and will store surplus 
energy during the times of their minimum activity: the use 
of this surplus stored force will therefore occur at the begin- 
ning of higher than normal activity after normal conditions. 
Where however the amount of stored force is not relatively 
large the surplus energy will soon be exhausted, and then 
the pleasure quality in connection with the presentation will
-P-A-G-E-393
    
PLEASURE-PAIN AND INTENSITY 379 
disappear. The storage capacity is not likely to be large 
unless the organ has often been hypernormally stimulated. 
This must lead us to hold, as we have noted above, that the 
Jirst appearance of a presentation must be normally accom- 
panied by a certain degree of pleasure. This should mean 
that in general the stream of presentations, apart from such 
as are notably persistent, are pleasant; and this appears to 
be true. The pains of enforced activity and of restriction 
are so notable, and involve such powerful protective reactions 
in the system as a whole, that we are wont to emphasize the 
fact of their prevalence, as the pessimist especially does; but 
if we do so we clearly overlook the fact that the vast mass 
of the experiences of life are spontaneous and involve moder- 
ate pleasures. Indeed (if we except the narrow region where 
pleasure-capacity appears to be practically lacking) it may 
be asserted without fear of dispute that all vivid presentations 
which have been before present in consciousness are at the 
start pleasant in some degree. The pleasure indeed may be 
very slight and of very short duration, and it will be so unless 
the presentation with which the pleasure is now connected 
has been often in attention, and unless there has been a some- 
what prolonged preceding time of non-appearance of the 
presentation with which it is now connected.' 
Our ordinary sensory field as it appears in consciousness 
has usually the slight balance in favor of pleasure which comes 
with such beginnings of activity: our sense organs are con- 
stantly changing the scope of their activity in small ways, 
and with the change comes slight pleasure. Apart from our 
sensations, which are determined directly by environmental 
stimuli that often involve hypernormal activity, the great 
mass of our conscious states have this slightly pleasant tone 
1This necessarily carries with it the implication that pleasure is not 
always determined by antecedent artificial restriction of rise in consciousness, 
but may be determined by simple increase of intensity of content: i.e. 
pleasure is not always mere satisfaction of desire, as has been so often held.
-P-A-G-E-394
  380 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
where the flow is spontaneous as we say: i.e. easy and not 
forced through habits of attention. What we speak of as 
spontaneity would then, under this theory, imply pleasure ; 
and common observation bears out the theory in this respect. 
Wide fields of low-grade pleasure-getting, thus reached, form 
the groundwork of aesthetic effects. 
Sec. 7. It is to be noted here again that pleasure and 
pain, when appreciated as such, are thus appreciated because 
they involve the appearance of special noetic emphases, i.e. 
special “senses of relation,” and when these form the presen- 
tations of given moments they, strictly speaking, must be 
as such more or less intense. It is to be recalled however 
that we usually use the word intensity to refer to the degree 
of emphasis of our sensations. We are much more likely 
to refer to degrees of pleasure and pain although we are not 
without justification in speaking of the pain quality or the 
pleasure quality as being more or less intense or vivid. In 
like manner, on the other hand, a given intensity when 
appreciated as such is of the type which we describe as an 
idea or a thought, and as such has the algedonic qualifications 
which belong to all presentations of its kind. 
Il. Tue Retation to Maniro.pness 
Sec. 8. As we have seen in a previous chapter Intensity 
and Manifoldness are inversely related: the more vividly an 
intensity appears in a complex presentation the less is mani- 
foldness appreciated ; and vice versa the less of intensity the 
more of manifoldness. If then it is true, as we have just 
seen, that pleasure and pain are usually bound up with notice- 
able intensities, then we should expect to discover that where 
manifoldness is highly developed in the presentation of any 
moment marked pleasure and pain will be lacking. 
Manifoldness appears less marked in the realm of sensation
-P-A-G-E-395
  
PLEASURE-PAIN AND MANIFOLDNESS 381 
than in other psychic realms, so much so that until very 
lately it has been assumed that certain sensations are psychic 
elements or atoms devoid of all manifoldness. We should 
expect therefore to discover our most marked pleasure-pain 
experiences in connection with sensations which display 
intensity rather than manifoldness. This is so general an 
experience that the common man is wont to think of pleasures 
and pains as forms of sensation, it being difficult indeed to 
persuade even the trained psychologist that the common man 
is altogether wrong in this, and that the algedonic quality 
is a general quality of all forms of presentations. 
In the realm of thought we have manifoldness developed 
in the highest degree; and here then we should expect to 
find the pleasure-pain quality notably lacking in prominence. 
If we move from the realm of sensation to the realm of 
thought by steps graded in relation to increase of manifold- 
ness, through perception and conception up to our broadest 
processes of reasoning, we find a loss of pleasure-pain promi- 
nence coordinate with the increasing prominence of the 
manifoldness attaching to the presentations: and when we 
reach the realm of pure thought our presentations seem so 
lacking in either pleasure or pain that we usually class them 
as indifferent. What we thus think of as a state of indif- 
ference is indeed, as I have already said, a state in which 
there is so little of either pleasure or pain that they are com- 
monly overlooked : and it appears to me that there is always a 
shade of pleasure attached to the flow of thought when it is 
spontaneous, as we say ; and a shade of pain attached to this 
flow when it appears to be forced upon us. 
Sec. 9. We must assume however that where manifold- 
ness is highly developed each differentiable element of the 
complex presentation may be in some slight measure colored 
with pleasure or pain; and if this is true we should expect 
occasionally to experience complex presentations in which a 
large number of the elements are very slightly painful or 
   
-P-A-G-E-396
382 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
very slightly pleasant, the pains and the pleasures being sum- 
mated as it were, so that the whole state would appear one of 
voluminous pain or pleasure as the case'may be. The pre- 
sentations connected with feverish conditions, for instance, 
display a high degree of manifoldness, and here the painful- 
ness is full and voluminous and evidently summational, in 
correspondence with the broadness of the parts affected by 
the morbid conditions. In similar manner the generally 
distributed sense of genial warmth which we experience when 
we stand before a blazing fire in winter is evidently highly 
manifold and also highly pleasant: and very evidently these 
warmth pleasures are of a summational type. 
Even in the realm of thought in which manifoldness is 
prominent, and which as we have seen in itself usually seems 
indifferent, we appreciate something of the experience of 
the summation of pleasures where the whole state is allowed 
to remain thoroughly spontaneous, as in reverie, day dream- 
ing, in the flow of fancy and of unrestrained imagination. 
The relatively permanent aesthetic pleasures are to a great 
extent developed by such summation of pleasures! of minor 
degree ; and in a large proportion of art works of lasting 
importance the pleasant impression upon the observer is 
highly voluminous. Especially is this true in the case of 
music, although it is not difficult to show that the same effect 
is observable in other noble forms of artistic production. 
Sec. 10. As we have indicated in Chapter 1x., the one of all 
our presentations in connection with which manifoldness is 
most distinctly marked is the empirical ego: in connection 
with the empirical ego therefore we should expect to note 
distinctly these summational pleasures and pains, although 
of so moderate a degree that they would not often attract 
our attention as such. And it is clear that while the empirical 
ego as such is never a markedly painful or pleasant presenta- 
tion, we do experience it as summationally algedonic, as is 
1Cf. my Aesthetic Principles, pp. 43 ff.
-P-A-G-E-397
  PLEASURE-PAIN AND MANIFOLDNESS 383 
shown in the fact that psychologists very generally recognize 
the marked subjectivity of pleasure and of pain, this being 
an acknowledgment that when we consider the distribution 
of pleasures and pains we find them in general more closely 
appreciated in connection with our experience of the subject 
or empirical ego, than in connection with that of the object 
contrasted with the empirical ego. 
Ill. Tue Reration to ATTENTION 
Sec. 11. Attention is a term descriptive of the whole 
state of consciousness in a given moment so far as it involves 
an emphasis of the relation between the emphatic partial 
presentations which we speak of as intense, and the mass of 
unemphatic partial presentations which make up the realm 
of manifoldness. If then pleasant and painful presentations 
are bound up with marked intensities, as we have seen is the 
case, they must as a rule be marked in attention, and this 
is a matter of common experience. A painful or pleasant 
presentation at once attracts attention. It is to be noted 
however in this connection that states of attention do not 
necessarily involve any great vividness of intensity ; all that 
is necessary to their existence is a certain sharpness of con- 
trast between a broad field of manifoldness and what may 
be a very moderate intensity. And as we have seen, we 
are wont to overlook the pleasures and pains connected with 
moderate intensities, and to think of the presentations to 
which they are attached as indifferent. We should expect 
therefore to find that states of attention are not in the least 
limited to noticeable pleasures and pains; but that what we 
call indifferent states are also attended to: and this should 
be more noticeable in the realm of thought than in sensational 
realms, as the algedonic quality is less vivid in the former 
than in the latter. Clearly this expectation is verified by  
-P-A-G-E-398
  384 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
introspection. Sensations which are attended to are notably 
algedonic: but in the realm of thought, many presentations 
to which keen attention is given are not considered in their 
algedonic aspect at all, or if thus considered are usually looked 
upon as indifferent. Iam very certain however that careful 
introspection usually shows the existence of very moderate 
degrees of pleasure and of painfulness even in such cases. 
Where the attention is free and spontaneous it is always in 
my experience pleasant to attend: where it appears forced in 
any degree as the result of inhibitions of any kind it seems 
something more than non-pleasant, and actually moderately 
painful.* 
Sec. 12. The relation of attention to pleasure-pain is some- 
times expressed as though there existed an opposition between 
the two, rather than the harmony above considered. Thus 
Volkmann? says: ‘‘Zwischen der Bestimmtheit des Inhaltes 
und der Stirke der Betonung besteht ein umgekehrtes Ver- 
haltniss,” and he thus expresses an introspective fact which 
each of us can readily verify. But no opposition to the 
view stated in the preceding sections is here involved ; for 
Volkmann’s statement has reference, not to the fact that 
marked cases of attention are commonly also markedly alge- 
donic, but rather to the very commonplace fact that very 
diverse presentations cannot be attended to at the same 
moment. For it must not be forgotten that when we con- 
sider the algedonic quality in itself we do so because we 
experience a special sense of relation, which is a very definite 
form of presentation. What is referred to in the above 
1In those cases of attention which we may call with Prof. Bain cases of 
“neutral excitement,” I seem to notice a constant shifting of ground; a 
constant alteration of the presentation attended to: in fact this shifting is 
implied in the common sense meaning of the word “excitement.” I am 
led by introspection to agree with Prof, Sully that these states are really 
widely but dimly tinged with pleasure or with pain. 
2 Lehrbuch d. Psychologie, 35.
-P-A-G-E-399
PLEASURE-PAIN AND ATTENTION 385 
quotation as the ‘‘ Starke der Betonung” is such a presenta- 
tion, and the ‘‘Inhalt” is another presentation of a diverse 
kind. All that we state then in the sentence above quoted 
is that of the two diverse presentations thus considered, 
attention to one tends to preclude attention to the other. 
Pillsbury! says ‘‘As we attend, objects tend to lose their 
pleasantness or unpleasantness and become entirely indif- 
ferent.’ This is however ‘‘when attention is directed to 
the feeling process itself and alone.”? Here we are evidently 
attending to the special pleasure sense-of-relation, or to the 
special pain sense-of-relation, which are within presentative 
realms far removed from the pleasure or pain giving elements ; 
are in fact within the realm of ideas in which we find all senses 
of relation; and in this realm, as we have seen, noticeable 
pain or pleasure is very often lacking. When I turn my 
attention from a pleasant presentation to pleasure in itself, 
the presentation to which the pleasure was attached necessarily 
disappears from attention. 
Sec. 13. If pleasure indicates the efficiency of the special 
neural part which is called into activity coincidently with the 
pleasant presentation, then pleasure should imply a tendency 
to persistence of activity in that special neural part: and if 
this is so, then the partial presentation to which the pleasure 
attaches should tend to retain its peculiar intensity, and should 
tend to remain in contrast with the field of manifoldness ; 
that is it should tend to persist in attention. If on the other 
hand pain indicates the inefficiency of the special neural part 
which is called into activity coincidently with the painful 
presentation then pain should imply a tendency to a lessening 
of the activity in that special neural part: and if this is so 
then the partial presentation to which the pain attaches should 
tend to lose its peculiar intensity, and should tend to fail to 
remain in contrast with the field of manifoldness; that is it 
should tend to fail to persist in attention.

    386 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
That these expectations are met in our experience is very 
clear. It is easy to keep our attention fixed upon pleasant 
presentations; but attention evidently tends to “fritter 
away” from painful presentations, which we can keep before 
our minds only by an effort unless they are forced upon us. 
So clear is this that Dr. James Ward! has stated the facts 
of pleasure-pain in terms of attention, as follows: ‘‘ There 
is pleasure in proportion as a maximum of attention is 
effectively exercised ; and pain in proportion as such effective 
attention is frustrated.” 
The view we have above expressed, so far as pleasure is 
concerned, will be accepted without objection; but some 
reader may not improbably object that it is difficult to agree 
that painful presentations tend to be lost to attention, if he 
happens to be experiencing the painful throb of a neuralgic 
toothache. He must note here however that the painful 
presentation in such a case is kept in attention by the per- 
sistence of the stimulus which produces action in a diseased 
nerve; and that pains thus persist in attention no one of 
course will deny. What is asserted is that a painful presenta- 
tion, if /eft to itself so to speak, tends to fail of persistence 
in attention ; while a pleasant presentation, if /eft to itself, 
tends to persist in attention. Stop the continued irritation 
of your tooth nerve, and the painful sensation tends to drop 
out of attention at once: but stop the stimulation that gives 
a pleasant presentation, and this pleasant presentation tends 
to persist in attention, to be clung to. 
There are certain pains, often also persistently held in atten- 
tion, which do not seem at first sight to be due to excessive 
stimulation from the environment. These we may look upon 
1 Encyclopedia Britannica, Article “ Psychology,” p. 71. Confer Stout’s 
statement (Analytical Psychology, ii. p. 270) : “Our starting point lies in the 
conception of mental activity, as the direction of mental process to an 
end, . . . The antithesis between pleasure and pain is coincident with the 
antithesis between free and impeded progress to an end.”
-P-A-G-E-401
  PLEASURE-PAIN AND ATTENTION 387 
as due to the excessive stimulation of the nerve part which gives 
us the coincident pain, by what is for this part its environment, 
although this environment may be entirely within the neural 
system far separated from the terminal sense organs. It is 
easy to conceive how, quite within the system, morbid con- 
ditions of nutrition may exist which will produce excessive 
activity along the lines of nerve conduction, which will be 
represented in consciousness by persistent pains not easily 
recognized as due to any excessive stimulation of the nerve 
parts directly affected. And it is to be noted that by readjust- 
ment of nutritive supply the organ whose activity is coinci- 
dent with the pain may be prevented from rapid deterioration 
and thus the pain’s persistence may be greatly prolonged : 
it has always been the aim of the torturer to produce such 
conditions. 
Sec. 14. We are thus brought to the consideration of 
the relation between pleasure-pain and the movement of 
attention in association. 
It will be agreed that in the natural unobstructed flow of 
thought, in reverie for instance when we “‘let ourselves go” 
as we say, a tendency appears to dwell upon pleasant things. 
This means that in the movement of attention pleasant pre- 
sentations rather than painful ones tend to be associated. It 
is true that men often dwell upon matters that are called 
disagreeable. But it is always doubtful in such cases whether 
they are disagreeable in anything but name,—whether the 
individual is not actually enjoying them, or the self-sympathy 
connected with them. In most cases where we dwell upon 
painful matters it will be found that the pains (e.g. pains of 
disappointment) are determined by the restriction of the de- 
velopment of thoughts which would normally be pleasant, or 
else are pains determined by persistent stimulations either 
primary or secondary. At all events it is to be noted that 
when painful thoughts do thus persist they are spoken of as 
“morbid,” which involves a recognition that the condition
-P-A-G-E-402
  388 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
in which this occurs is abnormal, and that the natural course 
of the flow of thought tends to show a movement from 
pleasure to pleasure. 
The considerations which have preceded this should have 
led us to look for just such conditions; for evidently the 
tendency to the persistence of presentations, which is involved 
with their pleasure, should tend to establish associations ; and 
the tendency to the disappearance of presentations, which is 
involved with their painfulness, should tend to prevent the 
formation of associations. For associations involve close 
bonds between the elements associated; and while the 
tendency to loss of emphasis which goes with pain in con- 
nection with a given presentation will lead to a breaking of 
bonds, the tendency to persistence of emphasis which goes 
with pleasure will lead to a strengthening of bonds.’ 
1$ome pessimist may here object that in what has been said I assume the 
existence of more pleasure than pain in this world; and that I am thus 
begging a most important question ; for he is convinced from his experience 
of life that quite the opposite is the case,—that there is more pain by far 
than pleasure in life, 
To this I would reply that, apart from the question of fact to be referred 
to below, he is confusing the question at issue. In terms of our present 
thought he is claiming that the world for him is one in which presentations 
to which the word pain attaches predominate over those to which the word 
pleasure attaches. I shall not deny that this is a record of a true experience 
for a pessimist at the time of his making his objection ; although I deny 
that it is true for many men for any but a small proportion of the hours of 
their thoughtful lives ; and doubt whether it is true even for the pessimist 
for any large proportion of these hours. 
But even if we accept the pessimist’s statement as a fact, this fact does 
not stand in opposition to our contention : for all that he can claim is that 
in these special moments the presentations to which the word pain is 
attached .are forced upon his attention by considerations which appeal to 
him from without the natural development of these presentations in thought. 
What I am claiming is quite another matter ; viz. that a painful presenta- 
tion (not a presentation to which the name painful is attached) naturally 
tends to disappear from attention. 
I may add here however that I find in my experience no ground for the
-P-A-G-E-403
  PLEASURE-PAIN AND ATTENTION 389 
The question is sometimes raised whether pain as such, 
and pleasure as such, can act as bonds of association ; but if 
what we have just said be true association cannot occur 
through algedonic bonds, if we retain the current meaning 
of the term association. For under this usual conception 
only specific presentations can be associated; even as only 
the activities of specific neural parts can become closely con- 
nected. Pleasure and pain, being general qualities involving 
general ‘‘senses of relation,” if they are attended to as such 
“senses of relation”? must tend respectively to arouse any 
one pleasant or painful presentation as well as another ; and 
no definiteness of relation, such as is necessary to association 
as ordinarily understood, would be fixed. The most that can 
be said is that pleasure involves a tendency to unlock the 
efficient activities of the system as a whole, and to make 
consciousness more wide awake ; and, on the other hand, that 
pain involves a tendency to cause all activities within the 
system to cease, and to benumb consciousness, if we may so 
speak. And these conclusions, in my view, accord with our 
experience. Where there appears to be an association by 
mere pleasure, or by mere pain, we really have in the one case 
an association of one pleasant presentation with another 
pleasant presentation ; and in the other case an association 
of one painful presentation with another painful presentation. 
We can no more make pleasure-pain itself a basis of 
association than we can make degree of intensity a basis of 
association. 
pessimist’s claim that there is a balance of pain in this world. The natural 
flow of presentations appears to me to be from pleasure to pleasure, mild in 
form though this pleasure be, so mild indeed usually as to lead us to call the 
presentations indifferent. Occasionally this flow of presentations is thwarted 
by some opposition, which involves a pain and a concentration of attention 
upon the pain ; and the thoughtless pessimist forgets that relatively long 
flow of mildly pleasant thought which preceded the pain, and thinks of 
pain as predominant in the world because this pain has filled his conscious- 
ness for the moment.

IV. Tue Action or THE Emprricat Eco. Interest 
Sec. 15. As we have so often said, the influence of the 
broad unemphatic field of the psychic system can never be 
without its effect upon the nature of the emphases or presen- 
tations within consciousness. This broad systemic field is 
the field of inattention, i.e. the Self ; and this Self when 
represented presentatively appears as that simulacrum of the 
Self which we call the empirical ego. Now we have seen 
in a previous chapter that this ego of experience has a marked 
effect upon attention in what we call distinctly voluntary 
attention ; and as the algedonic quality is closely related to 
attention we should expect to note an observable influence 
from the empirical ego upon attention as it is related to the 
algedonic quality. 
Sec. 16. If pleasure involves the ebullition of reserve 
energy it must tend to involve a spread of effects throughout 
the whole nervous system, which would thus tend to react 
in special ways that would certainly be moulded under the 
laws of development to bring about a tendency to the con- 
tinuance of the activities of parts of the system which if 
once aroused to activity are able to act efficiently: for thus 
on the whole an economy of the energies within the system 
would be maintained. So far as this conservative efficiency 
of the nervous system has correspondents in consciousness 
it would appear in the action of such part of the broad psychic 
system as can be given as a presentation, viz. in the explicit 
action of the empirical ego; and we should be led therefore 
to expect to note an observable reaction of the empirical ego 
tending to sustain pleasant presentations in attention. 
That this expectation is met in our experience is shown 
in the fact that it is possible to define pleasure, as Herbert 
Spencer? did many years ago as a record of his introspective 
1 Principles of Psychology, Sec. 125. 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
  
  INTEREST 391 
observation, as “a feeling which we seek to bring into 
consciousness and retain there.” 
Sec. 17. Mr. Spencer goes on to define pain as ‘‘a feeling 
which we seek to get out of consciousness and to keep out :’ 
and this record of his introspective experience, which will 
be generally accepted, is found to be what we should be led 
to expect if our views are correct. 
Pain, under our view, involves a tendency of the active 
nerve organs to cease their activities unless they are compelled 
to action by the reception of stimuli. But so long as the 
painful presentation is maintained, its maintenance involves 
activities in the nervous parts which must have their effect 
upon the whole nervous system. These systemic activities 
would certainly be moulded under the laws of development 
to the conservation of the system by bringing about a 
tendency to the discontinuance of the activities of the parts 
of the system which are compelled to activity, although this 
activity be inefficient. The lack of efficient outcome of the 
stimulus in the direction which gives us the pain will determine 
a transfer of energy to new courses opening above, if we may 
so speak, the point of inefficient action, a process which the 
conservative tendencies of nature will emphasize. This 
means the appearance of new foci of attention,—the “‘ fritter- 
ing away” of attention so far as the painful presentation is 
concerned. 
Here again we see that so far as this conservative efficiency 
of the nervous system has correspondents in consciousness 
it would appear in the action of such part of the broad psychic 
system as can be given as a presentation ; viz. in the explicit 
action of the empirical ego ; and we should be led therefore 
to expect to note an observable reaction of the empirical ego 
tending to withdraw attention from the painful presentation, 
this being coordinate with the discontinuance of the activity 
of the inefficient nervous parts; and this expectation is met 
in the experience which is expressed by Mr. Spencer in the 
words above quoted.

  392 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL 
Sec. 18. It will be evident to the reader that in a large 
part of the preceding sections of this division of this chapter 
we have been dealing with the problem of what is called 
“interest.” 
“ Attention” says Stumpf! ‘‘is identical with interest” ; 
but to maintain such a view is to overlook the patent fact 
that we often pay attention to that in which all would agree 
that we do not take the least interest ; and this simply because 
we are forced to pay attention by stimuli which we cannot 
avoid. It therefore appears to involve an unwarranted use 
of terms to say that we are interested in anything that is not 
pleasant. Interest is our name for the maintenance of a 
pleasant presentation by the action of the psychic system ; 
ie. by the Self, which when represented in attention by its 
simulacrum appears as the empirical ego. If this is true it 
is improper to say that we ever take interest in painful states 
of attention. Painful states are of course often most vivid 
in attention; and as we have seen in earlier chapters no 
presentation can ever be said to be forced upon us quite apart 
from the action of the Self which always must have its 
influence upon the presentation maintained in attention. But 
this influence may be in the form of a welcome or of a rejec- 
tion ; and it is without doubt true, as we have noted above, 
that the Self, as represented in the empirical ego, always rejects 
a painful presentation. The painful states attended to are 
in the vast majority of cases due to excessive stimulations, 
using these words very broadly, which persist although the 
empirical ego rejects them and tries to make them cease ; and 
these can therefore not be called interesting. 
It is true that in some few cases pains appear to interest 
us in themselves. I have found myself, for instance, much 
interested, .as one would say, in the pains produced by my 
surgeon in performing a minor operation without the use of 
1 Tonpsychologie, i, 68. Stout uses the term in the same way in the 
opening paragraph of the third chapter of his Analytical Psychology.  
-P-A-G-E-407
    INTEREST 393 
anaesthetics: but clearly in this case the interest was due to 
my study of algedonic-theory, and was really quite apart from 
the pain; it inhered in the agreeable presentations related 
to what we would usually speak of as curiosity in reference 
to these unusual experiences. 
It is true also that interest may actually at times tend to 
sustain painful states, but I think only because they are 
involved with more vivid pleasures in which we may properly 
say that we are interested. The interest I have in attempting 
to complete the writing of this chapter induces me to persist 
in the work notwithstanding the moment’s weariness which 
would naturally lead my attention to flag: but the interest 
must be apart from the pain, and must relate to some pleasure 
connected with the painful presentation, e.g. in this case to 
the working out of some particular thought. 
Sec. 19. Interest then is the term we use to describe our 
sense of the action of the Self in sustaining in attention a 
pleasant presentation: when this action is distinct, the simu- 
lacrum of the Self, i.e. the empirical ego, also appearing as 
a partial presentation in a state of ‘‘ self-consciousness.” 
The action of the Self, as explicit in the empirical ego, 
in rejecting pain is evidently closely allied with aversion. 
This state is of course of much less importance in our life 
in relation to attention, because it means immediate loss of 
attention where the Self is markedly in control. 
Sec. 20. It is often held that pleasure and pain are the 
determinants of attention,” but this I think is far from the 
truth. Attention, as we have already seen, is often due very 
1Jt is to be noted that although Stout as above noted follows Stumpf, 
nevertheless he finds it useful to use the word aversion in describing what 
he calls “interest” in relation to pain. Confer his Analytical Psychology, 
p- 239; “Painfully toned attention is always constrained attention or 
aversion.” 
2Cf. Sully, Human Mind, pp. 162 and 163. I assume that he means 
pleasure and pain when he uses the word “ feeling.”

largely to the mere force of environmental stimuli. Stout 
is certainly right when he says! “there is an ambiguity in 
the statement that we attend to things because they interest 
us. . . . The coincidence of interest and attention is simply 
due to the fact that interest, as actually felt at any moment, 
is nothing but attention itself, considered in its hedonic 
aspect.”

CHAPTER XVII 
THE ALGEDONIC QUALITY IN RELATION TO REALNESS 
AND MANIFOLDNESS 
I. Tue Retation To REALNEssS 
A 
Sec. 1. We have seen reason to believe that the algedonic 
quality is one that inheres in the hypothetical psychic element, 
corresponding with the grade of elemental neural efficiency. 
Realness on the other hand we have seen is a quality which 
inheres in complex presentations because they involve not only 
the immediately given major presentations but also revivals 
of past presentations through all of which common elements 
persist. 
Realness being thus due to stability which is largely deter- 
mined by the power and persistence of primary or secondary 
stimulations, there is no special reason why this stability 
might not occur in connection with either efficient or in- 
efficient elemental responses, and therefore no reason why 
the corresponding presentations might not be either pleasant 
or painful. We should not expect then to find the realness 
of particular presentations varying directly with either the 
pleasure or the pain occurring in connection with them; in 
other words we should expect to find that the relation between 
realness and the algedonic quality in connection with par- 
ticular presentations is indeterminate.
-P-A-G-E-410
396 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
This expectation is certainly met in our experience; for 
no one would hold that all pleasant presentations necessarily 
display a high measure of realness, nor necessarily a low 
measure of realness ; nor that all painful presentations neces- 
sarily display a high measure of realness, nor necessarily a 
low measure of realness. Nor can we say that the degree 
of realness attaching to a given presentation fixes in any direct 
way its algedonic quality. A very real presentation may be 
a painful one, or it may be a pleasant one; as for instance 
my present toothache, or the fragrance of the cigar I am 
smoking, respectively. So an unreal presentation may be 
disagreeable or pleasant ; as for instance the witch, or the 
fairy godmother of the fairytale, respectively. 
Sec. 2. But although no direct relation necessarily holds 
between pleasure or pain in connection with a given presen- 
tation and its realness, nevertheless so many cases occur in 
which pleasant and painful presentations are very real that 
it would appear that some indirect relation at least must obtain 
between realness on the one hand, and pleasure and pain 
taken together on the other. Upon second thought however 
we see that we are here dealing with a fact involved with the 
direct relation existing between attention, and realness as 
noted in the object-subject relation, which within limits tend 
to vary together. As we have seen above, our most vividly 
pleasant and painful presentations must involve attention ; 
so they must tend to involve realness, and objectification of 
the presentation to which the realness attaches. To this 
matter we refer again below. 
B 
Sec. 3. While it thus appears that there is no direct 
relation between pleasure-pain and the measure of realness 
existing in connection with presentations that are pleasant 
or painful ; on the other hand it is clear that we might expect  
-P-A-G-E-411
PLEASURE-PAIN AND REALNESS 397 
to discover the existence of a somewhat definite relation 
between pleasure or pain as connected with existing presen- 
tations, and the realness of the presentations shat are to be. 
For as we have already seen pleasure in connection with a 
given presentation involves a tendency to the persistence of 
this presentation in attention ; and this persistence must tend 
to involve, in the moments to follow, the stability of the 
presentation which will give it realness. On the other hand 
pain in connection with a given presentation involves a 
tendency to the failure of this presentation in attention, and 
this failure must tend to involve, in the moments to follow, 
the instability of the presentation which will give it unreal- 
ness. 
Under this view then pleasure in connection with a given 
presentation should tend to give realness to its future revival, 
while pain in connection with a given presentation should 
tend to give its revival unrealness. 
Such a statement as this is likely to be misunderstood if 
we overlook the fact that the algedonic quality is elemental ; 
for we are wont to consider complex presentations in bulk 
as pleasant or as painful, when in fact only some elements of 
the complex are thus algedonically qualified. If our view 
is correct we should not expect the whole of such a so-called 
pleasant complex presentation to become necessarily more 
real in the future: all that we should expect to observe would 
be the increased realness, in the future, of the elements of 
the complex which are now pleasant. Similarly we should 
not expect the whole of such a so-called painful complex 
presentation to become necessarily less real in the future: 
all that we should expect to observe would be the increased 
unrealness, in the future, of the elements of the complex 
which are now painful. 
Beyond this, although we should expect to note increased 
realness given to a complex presentation by the pleasure 
attached to one or more of its elements, nevertheless we 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
  398 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
should be prepared to find this tendency thwarted by opposi- 
tions otherwise arising to the stability of other elements of 
the complex presentation, which thus as a whole may gain 
no increase of realness in the future, notwithstanding that 
pleasure attaches to certain of its partial elements. Similarly 
on the other hand we should expect to note that a complex 
presentation as a whole may lose little of its realness in the 
future, or may for other reasons even gain an increase of real- 
ness, notwithstanding that pain was originally attached to 
certain of its partial elements. 
Practically all of the presentations of our active waking 
life are just such complex presentations as we have been 
describing, and it is evident therefore that we should not 
expect to find more than indirect evidence of a general drift 
in the direction of that relation between the establishment 
of realness-unrealness of future moments and the pleasure- 
pain of a given moment for which our theory leads us to look : 
such indirect evidence however we have in abundance. 
Sec. 4. When presentations of certain types are per- 
sistently pleasant in a large proportion of the cases in which 
they occur, the descriptive term ‘‘ pleasant” becomes indis- 
solubly attached to them, so that they are always classed with 
the pleasures of life, whether they are pleasant or not in the 
moment of occurrence : joy, for instance, is generally thought 
of as a pleasant emotion, although as we know we may at 
times experience a joy that is so excessive as to be truly 
painful.t Similarly when presentations of certain types are 
persistently painful in a large part of the cases in which they 
occur, the descriptive term “‘ painful” becomes indissolubly 
attached to them, so that they are classed with the pains of 
life whether they are painful or not in the moment of occur- 
rence: fear, for instance, is generally thought of as a painful 
emotion, although at times we may experience a mildly 
pleasant fear.

-P-A-G-E-413
  
  PLEASURE-PAIN AND REALNESS 399 
This being true we should expect to find that in the long 
run the presentations to which the term “pleasant” has 
become attached will tend to be thought of as real: and on 
the other hand that the presentations to which the term 
“painful” has become attached will tend to be thought of 
as less real or unreal. In other words we should expect to 
find ourselves thinking of the pleasant experience, of our past 
lives as the more real, and of the painful experiences of our 
past lives as the less real or unreal: and it is clear that this 
expectation is met in our experience. 
The presentations which have unrealness are those which 
give to us the problems of life. This shifting shadow on 
the mist ;—what is the reality involved? This vague and 
mysterious sense of influences affecting us apart from the 
recognized stimuli reaching us from the objective world ;— 
what does it mean? The evidence in favor of some scientific 
hypothesis fails of complete realness, and leads the student 
to state a problem: the very questioning indicates that real- 
ness is lacking. If then pleasures tend to involve future 
realness, and pains tend to involve unrealness we should 
expect to find men looking upon pain, in itself as a whole, 
as involving a problem; but we should not expect to find 
them considering pleasure as a whole as involving any 
problem at all. Now asa matter of fact, as Prof. James has 
somewhere remarked, it never seems to us that there is such 
a thing as a problem of pleasure ; even as we fail to wonder 
at the existence of those correlates of realness, Truth, Good- 
ness, and Beauty, and the Real in general. But on the other 
hand men very generally do set for themselves the problem 
of pain ;—that is we feel that, in relation to pleasure, pain 
taken as a whole is unreal, and we attempt to harmonize 
with the Real in the universe the existence of this pain, and 
of its correlates, Error, Evil, and Ugliness, and the Unreal 
in general. We set for ourselves these problems as to the 
existence of Pain, Error, Evil and Ugliness only because of
-P-A-G-E-414
Fee arrest Se er en EE RE OTe fe ee en tee ee et ee 
400 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL 1 
a deep seated conviction that they display marked unrealness, 
and that Pleasure, Truth, Goodness and Beauty are more 
real. 
The fact that painful presentations tend to become unreal 
in retrospective states is further vouched for by the existence 
of those who teach that the suffering of an individual can 
be alleviated if he can be made to believe that pain is intrinsi- 
cally unreal; a teaching which in our day is emphasized by 
that large body of men and women_who call themselves 
Christian Scientists, Metaphysical Healers, Faith Curists, 
etc. None of these worthy people attempt to make converts 
by teaching that the pleasures of life are unreal; although 
of course such truth as there is in their theses applies as well 
to pleasure as to pain. Apparently they have unwittingly 
grasped the fact that painful presentations tend to become 
unreal, as is not the case with pleasant presentations. With 
this fact before them they proceed naively and illogically 
to step from one realm of realness to another, carelessly 
shifting from the realm of presentations which they 
describe as ‘‘purely mental states” to that diverse realm 
| which we speak of as “objects in the outer world.” 
Appreciating that pain has a fundamental tendency to 
unrealness, they leap to the unwarranted conclusion that the 
realities which carry pain with them are intrinsically unreal. 
Convinced of this unrealness of painful presentations them- 
selves, they jump to the conclusion that disease, which is a 
fact in “the outer world” part of consciousness, is iz like } 
manner unreal; a conclusion from the premises which is | 
entirely unwarranted. 
A bit of corroborative evidence which each of us may 
experience, is found in watching the natural development of 
thought in “‘ day hone, when we deliberately cut off,   
so far as.possible,-al\sources of connection with the stimu- 
lation from the outer world, and avoid, so far as may be, all 
guidance from the Self ;—when we let Fancy have full sway.
-P-A-G-E-415
PLEASURE-PAIN AND REALNESS — 401 
In such moments it is the world of what we call “‘ pleasant 
things” that becomes for the time the real world for us. If 
its unrealness is for a brief moment forced upon us, we often 
voluntarily cast off this unrealness, and establish a ‘‘ make 
believe” world in which the natural flow of Fancy, the natural 
series of recurrent ‘‘pleasant thoughts” is the real world 
for us. 
Even the very young gain the habit of identifying their 
pleasures with realness. I find that the boys and girls of 
my time and environment are wont, in the language of their 
slang, to speak of an object of admiration, or of a present 
delight, as “‘the real thing.” But as we have seen above we 
can only be expected to observe this tendency distinctly ‘in 
the long run.” The vivid life of the present, or of what we 
call the just-past, is so disturbed by stimulations which alter 
the natural development of presentations that we must look 
for a stronger and stronger feeling of this relation of realness 
to pleasure as life progresses, and as memory unfolds before 
us more and more of the pages of experience for our contem- 
plation. And, as a matter of fact, as we grow older, the 
tendency to identify the memory of pleasure-experiences 
with realness becomes more and moreevident. Itisembodied 
in the conviction that life, and the conditions of life, in our 
past were more enjoyable than those of the present. We 
long for the ‘‘ good old times,” our ideals are in things of the 
past ; a fact which becomes more and more marked as age 
increases, until we find the very old, whose powers of receiy- 
* ing stimulations from the environment are dulled, living in 
a dream-land peopled with the friends of their youth, and 
occupied with thoughts of what they call the happy days of 
childhood and adolescence, which in fact were as full of pains 
of excess and disappointment as any in later life. 
Sec. 5. It may be well for us to refer briefly to a difficulty 
which will occur to many who have suffered deeply, for in 
such cases it cannot be denied that presentations to which 
2c 
   
-P-A-G-E-416
| 
402 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
the word pain is attached persistently recur in the conscious- 
ness of many men, and are very real for them. But it is to 
be noted that they are real in a narrow sense, as present 
experiences ; and not in the broader sense in which the wealth 
of life’s experience is considered. ‘There is no proof, as is 
claimed by some pessimists, that our past pains are revived 
more persistently than our past pleasures. The claim is 
dependent upon the fact that pains when recurrent attract 
more attention than pleasures when recurrent: we are active 
in attempts to get rid of the pains: we in general let the 
pleasures run their full course. 
These persistent pains are due in part to persistent recur- 
rence of excessive stimulations which produce pain. But 
much more often they consist of the thwarting pains due to 
obstruction of the natural development of our presentations : 
such for example are the persistent pains which occur in con- 
nection with the loss of those whom we have loved deeply : 
pains which are persistent and real in our present just because, 
and only because, of the ever pleasant movements of attention 
which are ever thwarted. The natural flow of attention 
developes in directions indissolubly bound up with the 
thought of the life of our deceased friend; and this flow 
of attention is itself pleasant, a fact which is usually over- 
looked: but in such cases, with each such pleasant develop- 
ment arises a thwarting as the fact is forced upon us that 
our friend is dead ; and this thwarting involves a pain which 
attracts attention. That this is the source of these persistent 
pains is shown in the fact that if we can but “‘make believe” 
that our friend is still with us, and allow the flow of thought 
to develope on that basis, the thwarting pain does not occur. 
It cannot be doubted that this ‘‘make believe” comfort has 
had much to do with the establishment of the belief in the 
near presence of, and the future companionship with, those 
friends who-have died.

  PLEASURE-PAIN AND OBJECT-SUBJECT 403 
Il. Tue Retation To THE Oxyect-Supyect RELATION 
Sec. 6. Having in the preceding sections considered the 
relation of the algedonic quality to realness ; and having, in 
the preceding chapter, studied the relation of the algedonic 
quality to manifoldness; we are now prepared to turn our 
thought to the relation of the algedonic quality to the relation 
between realness and manifoldness which, as we have seen in 
Chapter xv., gives us the object-subject relation. 
As that which we appreciate as attention, when we consider 
the whole noetic pattern of a given moment, is the relation 
between the intensity developed in part of the whole complex 
presentation, and the manifoldness developed in the rest of 
the psychic field ; so what we appreciate as the object-subject 
relation is the relation between the realness developed in part 
of the whole complex presentation, and the manifoldness 
developed in the rest of the psychic field. We should expect 
therefore to find in the relations of the algedonic quality to 
the object-subject relation certain similarities with the relation 
of this algedonic quality to attention ; and this expectation 
we find fulfilled. 
Sec. 7. In our study in Chapter xvi. we considered first 
the relation of the algedonic quality to the intense focus, 
and to the manifold non-intense field, which together make 
up the whole field in which attention developes ; so here we 
may well consider first the relation of the algedonic quality 
to the object in which realness inheres, and to the subject in 
which manifoldness and a relative lack of realness prevails, 
which together make up the whole field in which the object- 
subject relation is developed. 
That relative lack of realness prevails in connection with 
the subject in this object-subject relation has already been 
shown, so far as is appropriate here, in Sec. 2 of Chapter xv., 
and in the interest of brevity I shall ask the reader who may

be interested in this point to refer back to this section in 
this connection. We may turn then at once to consider the 
relation of the algedonic quality to the object in this object- 
subject relation. 
Sec. 8. As intensity and realness tend to vary together, 
and as intense presentations tend to become the foci of atten- 
tion, so as we have seen? very real presentations tend to 
bring to us the appreciation of the object-subject relation. 
As vivid pleasures and pains involve intensity in the presen- 
tations which they qualify, pleasant and painful presentations 
become our most important foci of attention ;? and corre- 
spondingly we might expect that so far as pleasures and pains 
are real as such they will tend to be objectified in the object- 
subject relation. 
Pleasures however are so notably evanescent that their real- 
ness is maintained but for short spaces of time, and we 
| consequently have little tendency to objectify them, so little 
| in fact that pleasure, as we have seen, is assumed usually to be 
distinctly subjective, i.e. attached intimately to the subject 
rather than to the object in the object-subject relation. 
Pains tooare found to be evanescent when not forced upon us, 
and as such they share with pleasures the attribution of sub- 
jectivity ; less distinctly however because of the prominence 
in our experience of pains which are forced upon us, and 
which are not thus evidently evanescent. And these pains 
thus forced upon us become very real, and are at times very 
distinctly objectified, i.e. attached to the object in the object- 
subject relation. This is shown in the fact that we localize 
pains in various parts of the body, a very clear case of such 
objectification being given where one who has had a leg 
amputated locates his pain in the foot that no longer exists. 
Beyond this it becomes clear that both pleasures and pains 
which are relatively permanent in retrospect are objectified in 
1 Chap. xv. Sec. 4 ff. 2Cf. Chap. xvi. Sec. 11.

PLEASURE-PAIN AND OBJECT-SUBJECT —=§ 405 
the fact that we attribute an objective nature to our concepts 
of Beauty? and Ugliness which are dependent upon the 
existence of this relatively permanent pleasure and pain 
respectively in connection with given presentations. 
Sec. 9. But, as we have seen, not only pleasant and pain- 
ful presentations, but also indifferent ones may be attended 
to: so we should expect to note that indifferent presentations 
might well be objectified, especially as we have seen in 
Section 1 of this chapter that the relation between the occur- 
rence of the algedonic phases and realness is indeterminate. 
As a matter of fact introspective examination serves to show 
us that actually many of the most real and objective of our 
presentations are what we call thoroughly indifferent ones. 
The reader will recall that we have seen in Chapter x., 
Sec. 4, that in cases where the fullest of realness exists we 
often fail to appreciate its existence altogether ; at the same 
time the very real presentation in general fails to appear in 
the focus of attention, which fact involves that absence of 
pleasure or pain emphasis which leads us to speak of the 
presentation as indifferent. It is natural then that we find 
such very real presentations thoroughly indifferent ;* and we 
find them also failing of objectification unless their realness is 
brought into prominence by the raising of opposition in the 
form of doubt, when it becomes explicit; they are then 
clearly objectified although thus thoroughly indifferent. 
1The reader will recall Santayana’s definition of Beauty as objectified 
pleasure, 
2 The interpretation of this fact on its physical side is simple, for under 
the theory of pleasure and pain which we defend there can be no pleasure 
or pain in connection with a given presentation unless the coincident neural 
activity is relatively excessive; it must either be using surplus stored energy, 
or else be draining the system: and where the neural activity coincident 
with a presentation assimilates very fully with the “neururgic pattern” 
of the moment, as it must when the conditions of the fullest realness 
prevail, it cannot be excessive in relation to the activity of the system as a 
whole. 
   
-P-A-G-E-420
406 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. ig ee ee ot 
This connection of realness with indifference becomes 
clearer when we note that if a presentation to which is at first 
attached a vivid pleasure or pain loses its sense of novelty 
in toto, and becomes thoroughly real, then the pleasure or 
pain which was once attached to it is likely to disappear: with 
the thorough assimilation of the presentation with the whole 
of consciousness, i.e. with its increase of realness, comes loss 
of attention and also indifference. Even the most tender of 
married lovers come to a state of undisturbed, all but in- 
different, acceptance of each others characteristics. The two 
souls are fused as one; the realness of each for the other is 
complete ; and all algedonic emphasis is lost. 
On the other hand we may speak in this connection of 
certain cases in which an actual decrease of realness is closely 
connected with distinct pleasure and pain, which goes to show 
the indeterminateness of the relation of realness to the alge- 
donic quality. With the questioning of doubt goes a dis- 
turbance of calm; with it goes a tendency to more or less 
marked conditions of attention which always tend to be 
colored with pleasure or with pain. Doubt as to the realness 
of a presentation involves an act of attention with which goes 
an obstructive pain due to the curtailment of the develop- 
ment of the idea which, although sometime real, has for the 
moment lost its realness. And again if after the doubt there 
follow an assertion of belief in the realness of the presentation 
about which question has arisen, then to this assertion of 
belief is attached a pleasure in connection with relief from the 
strain of doubt, i.e. in connection with the breaking down of 
the incompatibility existing between the two opposed 
measures of realness. There will be a bit of the doubt pain 
mixed with the pleasure attached to the assertion of belief : 
but this will soon be lost by the shifting of attention due to 
the development of the pleasant presentation. 
Such pains and such pleasures as we are here describing are 
connected with the process of the attainment of a full real-  
-P-A-G-E-421
PLEASURE-PAIN AND OBJECT-SUBJECT = 407 
ness ; and the less of opposition to this realness in doubt, and 
the less of assertion of belief ;—in other words the nearer we 
approach to the establishment of a realness which brooks no 
questioning ;—the nearer do we approach to a total inatten- 
tion to the realness itself ; and this inattention involves in 
general a state of indifference with reference to the presenta- 
tion directly involved. 
III. Tue Action or THe Emprricat Eco 
Sec. 10. As we have so often said, no presentation, and 
no general quality of a presentation, can exist as real alto- 
gether apart from the influence of the mass of the psychic 
system, i.e. the field which is preeminently qualified by mani- 
foldness, which is the Self, which when presentatively explicit 
appears as the empirical ego. 
As we have seen, pleasant presentations tend in themselves to 
become real in future moments ; yet they cannot maintain this 
realness without the effective welcome from the Self. But the 
pleasure itself implies an efficient action in a neural part, which 
action in itself as we have already seen must in general be 
welcomed by the reciprocally aroused effective action of the 
physical system ; and correspondingly we should therefore ex- 
pect to note a tendency on the part of the psychic system—the 
Self as explicit in the empirical ego,—to enforce the realness of 
pleasant presentations. And this we do note; for we agree 
that Spencer is warranted in holding, in his words already 
quoted, that ‘‘pleasure is a feeling which we seek to bring 
into consciousness and to keep there”: i.e. to render stable 
or real, and to objectify. It may be added that but for the 
action of the whole psychic system, i.e. the Self, we find it 
difficult to account for the strengthening of our sense of the 
realness of pleasant presentations as a whole which leads us 
to persist in maintaining the realness of pleasure as such, 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
  408 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
notwithstanding the patent fact that the pleasure connected 
with any specific presentation is, as we have seen, notably 
evanescent and unstable. 
Painful presentations on the other hand tend in themselves, 
as we have seen, to become unreal ; and if the organic species 
in which they occur is to survive, this tendency must on the 
whole be enforced by the physical system, which has as its 
correspondent the psychic system, i.e. the Self. The pain 
itself implies an inefficient action in a part, which action in 
itself must in general be rejected by the physical system which 
as a whole is not aroused to efficiency by the inefficient action 
in the part. We should therefore expect to note a tendency 
on the part of the psychic system—the Self, as explicit in the 
empirical ego, to enforce the unrealness of pain; and this we 
do note: for again we agree that Spencer is warranted in 
holding, in his words already quoted, that “‘ pain is a feeling 
which we seek to get out of consciousness and to keep out” : 
i.e. to render unstable or unreal, non-objective. To the failure 
of the Self to welcome the painful presentation,—to its active 
rejection of the presentation so far as experience has formed 
appropriate ‘‘psychical dispositions” within the psychic 
system, is due the weakening of our sense of the realness of 
painful presentations as a whole which leads so many men to 
persist in thinking of pain, as such, as unreal, as non-objec- 
tive, as a mere subjective imaginary state, notwithstanding 
the fact that pain, and disease which brings us pain, are so per- 
sistently forced upon our attention during the whole of life. 
What we have said above is corroborated forcibly when we 
consider our tendency to self-sophistication in relation to 
pleasures and pains: for no one will question that we all have 
a tendency to persuade ourselves that what is pleasant is true 
(i.e. real) and that what is unpleasant is false (i.e. unreal). 
In such cases we recognize in reflection that the empirical ego 
has been effective in establishing the realness of the pleasant 
presentation and the unrealness of the painful one. 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
eee ee 
ACTION OF EMPIRICAL EGO 409 
As we have seen, this action of the empirical ego in relation 
to realness where explicit involves belief ; and we should expect 
therefore to find, as we do find, that pleasant presentations 
which involve futureness are welcome and become real as 
expectations! and are believed in as such ; while on the other 
hand the mass of painful presentations involving futureness 
disappear as expectations ; we refuse to believe in the realness 
of such presentations if they are painful,—we refuse to expect 
them,—we persist in hoping for a better outcome: ‘‘ hope 
springs eternal in the human breast.” 
It is evident however that we are here touching upon 
questions which may be better studied in Book m1. where we 
treat of the nature of the Self, and of that simulacrum of the 
Self which we call the empirical ego. We shall therefore 
content ourselves with this brief consideration and turn to 
our next problem.

  SUB-DIVISION Il. THE TIME QUALITY IN RELATION 
TO THE GENERAL QUALITIES OF GROUP I 
CHAPTER XVIII 
THE TIME QUALITY IN RELATION TO INTENSITY 
AND MANIFOLDNESS 
Sec. 1. In the two chapters preceding this, we have con- 
sidered the relation of one of the general qualities of presen- 
tations included in Group 2, viz. the Algedonic quality, to 
the general qualities of Group 1, viz. Intensity, Manifold- 
ness, and Realness. In this sub-division we turn to the 
study of the relation of these general qualities of Group 1 
to the other general quality of Group 2, viz. the Time 
Quality ; and in this chapter begin with the consideration of 
the relation of the Time Quality to Intensity and Mani- 
foldness. 
If our view is correct each presentation must display some 
measure of intensity and of manifoldness, while at the same 
time it must display also in some degree the characteristics 
which may lead to the appreciation of one of the time 
phases. We must enquire in the first place whether in 
connection with this coexistence, any definite time phase is 
implicated with either a notable degree of intensity or of 
manifoldness. 
  | 
{
-P-A-G-E-425
TIME AND INTENSITY 41 
I. Tue Retation To INTENSITY 
Sec. 2. The Time Quality, under our view, is determined 
by the form in which complex states of consciousness develop ; 
the special time phase being due to the relation existing, 
within the complex of a given moment, between the rein- 
statements of minor secondary presentations which have been 
given in previous moments. Intensity on the other hand is a 
quality of the psychic element which is correspondent with a 
high degree of activity in a physical element as this is 
measured by objective standards; intensity as appreciated 
being inherent in relatively narrow parts of the very complex 
presentations in connection with which the several time phases 
are aroused. 
As then only a limited part of the whole presentation of 
any moment is distinctly intense, it would seem improbable 
that this intensity would be likely to determine any special 
time phase in a presentation so complex as one must be if in 
connection with it a time phase is to become explicit. In 
other words we should not be led to look for the existence of 
any determinate relation between marked intensity, and the 
time phase of the presentation in which this intensity appears. 
This accords with our experience. We find that a presen- 
tation which involves presentness may be more or less intense 
or vivid; and the same may be said of presentations which 
involve pastness or futureness. And again an intense or 
vivid presentation may equally well have an inherent pastness, 
or presentness, or futureness, at the moment of its appreciation 
as intense. 
Sec. 3. On the other hand it is clear that a presentation of 
high intensity which is fixed is likely to involve the condition 
of stationary complexity to which under our hypothesis is due 
our appreciation of presentness ; and equally clear that such 
conditions of fixed intensity are given most frequently in
-P-A-G-E-426
412 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
connection with the action upon us of stimuli from our en- 
vironment. We should expect therefore to find that in 
reflection upon past states our vivid sensations and percepts 
would tend to be distinctly lacking in pastness and futureness, 
and distinguished as involving presentness. That this ex- 
pectation is met in our experience is clear. The sharp cutting 
sensation, the intense sound, as considered in reflection are 
now here. ‘ Actual sensation” says Stout! “is the mark or 
stamp of present time. The present time, as distinguished 
from the past or future, is the time which contains the moment 
of actual sensation.” It is practically impossible for us to 
appreciate a very vivid sensation in itself as being past or 
future, or as being anything else than of the present. 
Next to mere sensations in order of vividness in attention 
are our percepts; and here too we very generally find in- 
volved the strong sense of presentness. This page upon 
which I write, when I reflect upon it, is so clearly in the 
“present” that it is very difficult to think of it as involving 
anything of pastness, or of futureness: it is existent in the 
“specious present.” 
Il. THe Retation to Maniroipness 
Sec. 4. Each presentation which displays a time phase 
must also display some measure of manifoldness, which upon 
occasion may be very marked. The quality of manifoldness 
is not elemental as intensity is, but is a quality which is deter- 
mined by the complexity of presentations, and under our 
view without such complexity the time phases themselves 
could not appear. Thus we should expect that the clear 
appreciation of the time quality of a given presentation would 
in a measure be coordinate with an appreciation of manifold- 
ness ; yet as each of the three time phases involves this mani- 
1 Manual of Psychology, p. 389. 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  
TIME AND MANIFOLDNESS 413 
foldness, we should not expect to note that a marked degree 
of manifoldness necessarily implies the existence of any 
special one of the time phases. 
This agrees with our experience. Presentations which 
display a notable manifoldness may, in the moment when the 
manifoldness is explicit, display either pastness, or futureness, 
or the transitional presentness: such a thought for instance 
as “‘the sidereal system” is distinctly qualified by manifold- 
ness, and it may be appreciated as well as it has existed, as 
it is, or as it is to be. So also presentations qualified by the 
diverse time phases may vary greatly in manifoldness: the 
idea of the pin prick which I am about to receive, and the 
thought of the warmth of the fire in the house I am approach- 
ing on a cold day, both have marked futureness but vary 
greatly in manifoldness: so the thought of the neuralgia of 
yesterday, and that of the conception of the long line of my 
ancestors, both have marked pastness but vary greatly in 
manifoldness: similar variations of manifoldness in connec- 
tion with presentations which involve the sense of presentness 
will readily occur to the reader. 
Sec. 5. If the positions maintained in what has preceded 
this are well taken, a presentation which has the quality of 
pastness is one which is tending to reduction of complexity 
and therefore tending to lose manifoldness ; while one which 
has the quality of futureness is gaining complexity and there- 
fore manifoldness; and if this is true it may occur to some 
reader that comparison of a presentation in which pastness is 
prominent, with one in which futureness is prominent, should 
invariably show a greater manifoldness in favor of the pre- 
sentation which has the quality of futureness. This however 
is evidently not corroborated by experience: for as I have said 
the stream of consciousness in coming to us seems to leap 
suddenly over a ledge as it were, while in going from usit seems 
to flow away over a plain the limits of which are broad and ill 
defined: that is, the future comes upon us under conditions
-P-A-G-E-428
  414 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL 
which seem to restrict us within more or less narrow limits, 
while the past seems to stretch away without bounds.’ In 
other words there would appear to be more of manifoldness 
connected with the past than with the future, and this it 
might be claimed is the contrary of what we might be led to 
expect. 
But if this appears as an objection to our view it is because 
our position is not thoroughly comprehended. If appreciated 
manifoldness is our apprehension of the complexity of the 
presentation in connection with which it appears, and if our 
theory as to the basis of the time quality is correct, it is clear 
that no difference of mere degree of a presentative manifold- 
ness per se will affect the time flow, which will only be affected 
provided this difference is appreciated as of changing form 
within the complex presentation considered : the time quality 
indeed would not exist but for the complexity of presenta- 
tions; yet it is not this complexity itself which determines 
the time quality, but rather a special characteristic of this com- 
plexity. Now it is not held that any comparison of two pre- 
sentations as to their amount of manifoldness determines the 
time quality, as is implied in this objection ;—in fact such a 
relation has just been specifically denied : but we make just such 
a comparison when we think of the future part of the stream 
1 This fact is evidently the result of the complex processes of assimilation 
which fave affected the systems which are active in the production of 
presentations in which pastness is prominent, which on the other hand 
have but just begun to affect the presentations which involve futureness. 
The presentation which has pastness is the conscious coincident of an 
active nervous system in which countless elements of unnumbered minor 
systems are throbbing as they would not throb but for the experience 
which is past and gone; and is therefore likely to be very complex, i.e. 
qualified markedly with manifoldness. The presentation which has 
futureness, on the other hand, is the conscious coincident of an active 
nervous system which is being affected by forces which are leading to 
the production of new forms of activity; which however have not yet 
spread themselves beyond relatively narrow limits within the broad complex 
system with which our complex consciousness is related.
-P-A-G-E-429
  TIME AND MANIFOLDNESS 415 
of consciousness in its relation with the past part of the stream 
in respect to the manifoldness of each part. What is held is 
that the complexity of a given presentation, whatever its 
degree may be, as held in attention presents, in contrast with 
the stationary complexity of the “specious present,” either 
a simplifying complexity in the case of pastness, or a develop- 
ing complexity in the case of futureness. 
Sec. 6. Although the relation between manifoldness and 
the phases of the time quality is thus indeterminate, never- 
theless, as some degree of manifoldness must exist if the time 
quality is to exist, we might expect that as the degree of 
noticeable manifoldness varies the noticeableness of the time 
quality in either of its phases would likewise vary ; and that 
where manifoldness is not easily discerned then timeness will 
not be easily observable. But as intensity and manifoldness 
are inversely related, indiscernibility of manifoldness involves 
distinctness of intensity ; hence we should not expect to find 
the time quality clearly appreciated in connection with our 
apprehension of intense presentations. And as a matter of 
fact the time phases of intense and vivid presentations (e.g. 
our sensations) do not concern us: the time phases are 
brought to our attention in connection with the manifold 
presentations of our reflective states. This is of course a 
matter of degree ; but I can easily imagine that, if one were 
suddenly awakened to fully developed conscious life looking 
at a brilliant light, the vivid punctual sensation given would 
involve no appreciation of time whatever. Of course we 
cannot actually experience any such perfectly simple punctual 
state ; and thus all of our experience, involving more or less 
of manifoldness, at the same time involves, as we have seen, 
the more or less explicit appreciation of that form which in 
reflection we speak of as the Time Quality.
-P-A-G-E-430
  416 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
Il. Tue Retation to ATTENTION 
  Sec. 7. In a large proportion of the moments of experi- 
ence our presentations display an intensity set over against, 
and related to, a field of manifoldness in what we call atten- 
tion ; but as neither marked intensity nor marked manifold- 
ness involve the emphasis of any special time phase we should 
not expect to note, in connection with a presentation as 
attended to, any more determinate relation to special time 
phases than we find between them and intensity or manifold- 
ness. This expectation is surely met in our experience, for 
clearly a presentation attended to may as well display pastness, 
or futureness, or may display neither and may thus involve 
the sense of presentness. 
Sec. 8. But if this is true it is equally clear on the other 
hand that processes of continued attention might be expected 
to affect noticeably the time phase in connection with subse- 
quent retrospective presentations. For this continued atten- 
tion involves the maintenance of the intensity of a given 
minor presentation in contrast with the rest of the psychic 
field, and this maintenance as we have seen tends to give us a 
sense of presentness especially in connection with attention 
to sensational and perceptual presentations, which in retro- 
spect are appreciated as having been distinctly present. It is 
true of course, as we have already seen, that even these sensa- 
tions and percepts upon close inspection appear to have their 
backward and forward ‘‘fringes”; but so far as we attend to 
them we attend to what we appreciate as being now with us,— 
in this present. It is also true that we may attend to what we 
speak of as sensations and percepts of the past and of the 
future; but then we are attending, not to the immediate 
revivals of sensations and percepts themselves, but to 
“images” or ‘‘representations” far removed from these 
immediate revivals of sensations and percepts; and these 
   
-P-A-G-E-431
  TIME AND ATTENTION 417 
images and representations themselves are appreciated as 
“now here.” 
Sec. 9. As under our hypothesis a presentation has the 
quality of pastness because it exhibits a simplifying com- 
plexity, pastness must ever be of less importance than pre- 
sentness in the arousal of presentations ; and in retrospect it 
should therefore tend to lose force in the field of attention in 
relation to what is experienced as present. This is surely in 
accord with experience ; for we find it difficult to hold our 
attention upon the past in the face of the ever living present, 
which is in a vast majority of cases the time quality of the pre- 
sentations to which we attend. We must separate ourselves 
away from, or cut off, the prominence of environmental 
stimuli if we are to enjoy the delights of reverie and remi- 
niscence, or gain the advantage connected with contemplation, 
and deliberation. 
Sec. 10. Apart from the conditions of fixed complexity 
determined by environmental stimulation we might expect to 
note a tendency to an association of attention with futureness. 
For, as we have seen in Chapter vurt., Sec. 7, the maintenance 
of a marked intensity in relation to the field of manifoldness 
in attention really means an increase of what we have called 
elemental intensity. Such maintenance of an intensity must 
therefore always involve a “‘budding” of new minor em- 
phases within the minor presentation whose intensity is 
thought of as fixed. But as this ‘‘ budding” is of the essence 
of futureness we should expect to note a general attribution 
of futureness to attention considered as a process. 
That, notwithstanding the presentness of the vivid atten- 
tion which is most common in connection with the sensations 
and perceptions of every day life, we do thus generally con- 
cede the existence of a special relation between attention and 
the sense of futureness is evident in the fact of which Stout?

  418 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
speaks, viz. that the original meaning of astendere is to expect or 
await. As he says ‘‘a certain prospective attitude of mind is 
characteristic of attention”: that is when we view the move- 
ment of attention as a whole, as we must do in the very pro- 
cess of giving it a descriptive name, we then actually tend to 
overlook altogether the ever-presentness of vivid sensational 
and perceptual attention and to emphasize the futureness 
aspect of attention as a whole. 
Sec. 11. If what we have said above is true, then succes- 
sive presentations of decreasing intensity which are held in 
attention might be expected to affect the form of the com- 
plexity of the presentation in a later moment, and in an 
opposite manner to that above described, and might be ex- 
pected to carry with them in the retrospective presentation a 
sense of pastness. We certainly do gain this sense of past~ 
ness in cases where we note that we are failing to hold a given 
presentation in attention, the “object of attention” is appre- 
ciated as “‘slipping away from us,” and being lost in that 
broad stream of what is past and gone. 
Sec. 12. On the whole then we may well say with Dr. 
Stout’ ‘‘In general temporal perception is bound up with 
the process of attention. The present is characterized by the 
actual sensations which serve to guide and determine atten- 
tion at the moment. The primary experience of ‘future- 
ness,’ if we may allow the expression, is involved in the 
essentially prospective nature of attention. The primary 
experience of ‘pastness? is involved in the cumulative effect 
of attention on its own process.” ? 
1 Manual of Psychology, p. 391. I have taken the liberty to change the 
order of Dr. Stout’s sentences. 
2Tt is interesting in this connection to note the use which our later 
composers of the musical drama have made of this relation between the 
time phases and changes of intensity as attended to. Wishing to suggest 
a notion of some theme arising in an anticipatory form in the mind of 
his hero, the composer increases the tonal force of the musical “ motif”

Sec. 13. As the efficiency of the Self, as explicit in the 
efficiency of the empirical ego, is clearly manifested in relation 
to attention, we should look for manifestations of this 
efficiency in connection with attention in its relation with 
the time quality.’ 
When we experience intense sensational and perceptual 
presentations we find it difficult to note the action of the Self 
in influencing attention, so much so indeed that as we have 
seen we commonly speak of this type of attention as involun- 
tary. But as we have also seen these very intense sensational 
and perceptual presentations give us our most vivid apprecia- 
tion of presentness: hence we should expect to find a general 
attachment of attention of the so called involuntary type to 
presentness ; that is we should in general find it unusual to 
note the action of the Self in maintaining attention upon 
presentations in connection with which the time forms 
futureness and pastness are not noticeable. And this I think is 
clear in the very fact that experiences of attention to sensational 
which he makes to correspond with this theme; in so doing necessarily 
increasing its complexity. Wishing to raise in our minds the thought of 
the forgetting of this theme by his hero, or of its existence in his mind 
as a mere reminiscence, he decreases the tonal force; at the same time 
decreasing the tonal complexity of the notes of the “ motif.” 
1$0 marked is this efficiency of the empirical ego in relation to the 
time phases that the very essence of the temporal quality has been thought 
by some psychologists to lie in the attitude towards the given presentations 
of the psychic system as developed in our self-conscious states. Thus 
R. A. P. Rogers (Mind, N.S. No. 53, p. 70) goes as far as to claim that 
desire, which involves the appreciation of the efficiency of the empirical 
ego, “is the subjective element which gives a meaning to the distinction 
between the Past and Present. The mind is passive in relation to the 
Past, active in relation to the Future. Without desire there can be no 
self-conscious existence in Time.” Dr. Hodgson is also claimed to advocate 
a similar conception.
-P-A-G-E-434
420 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
and perceptual presentations, which are distinctly appreciated 
as being in the present, give the basis for the claim that certain 
types of attention are involuntary, are altogether forced upon 
us, i.e. are not determined in any way by the nature of the 
Self. 
Sec. 14. If however we eliminate from consideration 
these cases of attention due to powerful stimulation we should 
expect to find that the efficiency of the Self will be more likely 
to be evinced in reference to presentness where under our 
view complexity is fixed, then in reference to pastness which 
is given in connection with simplification of complexity, and 
at times even more likely to be evinced in reference to future- 
ness where complexity is developing. For the development 
of complexity (futureness) will in general be more liable to 
arouse the whole psychic system—i.e. the Self, than fixed 
conditions of complexity (presentness) ; and both fixity of, 
and developing complexity always more liable to arouse the 
Self than conditions of simplifying complexity (pastness). 
And evidently this tendency must be emphasized by natural 
processes: for the exigencies of the struggle for survival must 
have tended to enforce the habit of giving less prominence to 
what is past in reference to which we are no longer called upon 
to react ; and more prominence to the present in connection 
with which reaction is demanded, and to what is coming to us 
in the future for which preparation is demanded if appropriate 
reaction is to take place. 
If then we eliminate the enforcement of attention by en- 
vironmental stimuli we should expect to discover a tendency 
of the Self, as explicit in the empirical ego, to enforce the 
concentration of attention upon pastness less than upon either 
presentness or futureness. And it seems clear that this expec- 
tation is met in our experience. It is only by strenuous 
effort that the average man keeps his attention sufficiently 
upon the presentations in connection with which pastness is 
developed to enable him to make use of the teachings of his

experience in life. For the most part we are as stupid in this 
respect as all animals:: we deal so largely with the present and 
with the future, and with such difficulty keep our attention 
upon the past, that we fail all too often to guide our lives in 
accordance with what we should learn from the occurrences of 
that past.

  CHAPTER XIX 
  THE TIME QUALITY IN RELATION TO REALNESS 
AND MANIFOLDNESS 
I. Tue Retation To REALNEsS 
Sec.1. Tue Time Quality and Realness under our view 
are both qualities which are determined by the complex 
nature of presentations; and which are appreciated in 
states of reflection. These states of reflection are special 
forms of the ‘‘ now” of experience in which we have before 
us in emphasis not the whole of this ‘‘now” itself, but a 
somewhat within it which we call a revival, or representa- 
tion, or idea, of a somewhat that has been, in which we 
discover both the time phase and the realness qualifications. 
It may be well then here again to note that we are to consider 
in what follows not the relation of realness to the “‘ now” of 
experience,—to the “real present” as it is sometimes called,— 
but the relation of realness as it appears in reflective states 
to certain qualities of those reflective states in which appear 
the temporal forms, pastness, and futureness, and at times 
what we call presentness. 
A difficulty is likely to arise in this connection if we over- 
look the fact that presentness when it is observed, inheres in 
the “now,” exactly as pastness and futureness do. In other 
words presentness when noted is as much attached to a form 
of revival as are either pastness or futureness when they are
-P-A-G-E-437
       
     
       
      
       
   TIME AND REALNESS 423 
   this presentness has, as we have seen, been 
rom the “‘now”—the “‘real present”—by 
thers as the ‘‘specious present.” When I 
ess in what follows I refer to this so called 
sent” and not to the ‘‘now” in which it, as 
ess and futureness, appear. 
Before we undertake the study of our main 
however it may be well to say a word about the 
of realness to this ‘‘now” of experience ; for it is 
ant that the designation of this ‘‘now” as the “real 
present,” in contradistinction from the “specious present” 
of reflection, is acceptable to most of us. In this we of 
course have a record of introspection which we may describe 
by saying that as considered in reflection the ‘‘now” of 
experience, as such, has marked realness. What we mean by 
this is that we recognize that the ‘“‘ now” of experience,—the 
existing presentation or emphasis in consciousness,—is what 
it is because it is assimilated, if but for the moment, with the 
remainder of the consciousness of the moment,—i.e. with the 
whole of the psychic system. 
| Our very conception of realness is thus bound up with our 
| experience of the ‘“‘now.” But this special quality,—this 
realness,—which always accompanies this ‘‘now” as such, 
| is found to exist in certain degrees in other cases where in 
reflective experience we view certain partial presentations 
within, and in relation with, the whole of the field of em- 
phasis. It is from this ‘‘real present” then that we carry 
over the conception of the quality more or less of which we 
find inhering in the diverse realms of realness which we look 
upon as existing apart as it were from this ‘“‘now” of experi- 
ence, although they of course always exist in a “ now,” which 
always is real as such. 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
   QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND    
  A. Realness and Presentness               
   
        Sec. 3. We are to consider here the 
between realness on the one hand ; and pasti! 
(“specious presentness”’), and futureness ; as 
flection: and as a matter of convenience we ma’ 
with the consideration of realness in its relation! 
transitional state in which futureness and pastness ard 
and which we describe as presentness. 
If it is true that any partial presentation within the 
presentative field will have in reflection more or less 0 
ness according as it assimilates more or less fully with this 
presentative field as a whole; then it would appear that we 
should be able to observe partial presentations which display 
presentness and at the same time varying degrees of realness : 
for evidently the relative fixity of complexity which yields 
presentness would not necessarily involve any determinate 
amount of assimilation with the field of reflection above | 
referred to. 
That some ‘‘presents” as given in reflection are so 
thoroughly real that no question is raised in connection 
with them is clear: but it is equally clear that others are 
so much less real that doubt does arise in relation to them 3 
were it not for this fact we would never be led to the con- 
ception of the unrealness of illusions, or of our memories 
of dreams, in connection with which presentness is clearly 
marked. 
Sec. 4. On the other hand it is clear that a tendency to 
the coordinate variation of realness and presentness is to be 
looked for if our hypothesis as to the basis of the time quality 
eter 
  | 
is correct: for under that hypothesis presentness is a transi- 
tional phase determined by a momentary fixity of complexity, 
and such fixity would in general be coordinate with the 
stability of certain minor presentations in successive noetic 
patterns observed in reflection, although it would not neces- 
A.  
-P-A-G-E-439
  a 
eee, TIME AND REALNESS 425 
sarily imply such conditions of stability. It is natural then 
to find that those presentations in connection with which 
presentness is noted are as a rule also preeminently qualified 
by realness. It is the present experience which we seldom 
hesitate to say is a real experience, and it is our sensational- 
perceptual experience, which as we have already seen is pre- 
eminently real, which is also thought of as most markedly 
present. 
All this is quite in accord with the fact considered in pre- 
vious chapters, viz. that intensity and realness tend to vary 
directly: for as we have already seen that intensity tends to 
involve presentness, so here we discover that realness tends to 
involve presentness. 
Sec. 5. Each “‘ present,”—each presentation in connec- 
tion with which presentness as a special sense of relation is 
markedly developed,—must of course as a presentation dis- 
play the time quality as a whole; it is a bit of what is called 
the stream of consciousness, and has the essential character- 
istics of that stream. In other words as every presentation 
must have in it the elements which if emphatic enough might 
give it recognized pastness, and also those which might give 
it a recognized futureness, so must the presentation in which 
presentness is marked. Evidently such a presentation may 
vary in character as this pastness, or futureness, tend to 
become important in attention, but in so far as they do become 
important the importance of the presentness itself, as such, 
must disappear. 
Quite apart then from the fact that presentness and realness 
may vary in connection with given presentations (see Sec. 3 
above) the stability,—the realness,—of presentness as such 
1This of course does not mean that realness and presentness are to be 
identified ; for under our hypothesis the fixity of presentness relates to the 
complexity as such, while the fixity of realness relates to some special minor 
presentation which is maintained in successive noetic patterns which are 
differentiated and compared within this complexity.  
-P-A-G-E-440
426 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
must be subject to distinguishable variations of degree, which 
are determined by the greater or less intrusion as it were 
of the hitherto unemphatic pastness or futureness as the case 
may be. 
Naturally this transition from realness to unrealness in 
connection with the presentness in such cases can be recog- 
nized only by + ~eful introspection. Yet in the case of the 
intrusion of pa this transition state is clearly brought 
into view in the vy. _zognition of what we have been 
speaking of as the ‘‘ specious present” : for in this recognition 
we actually see the realness of presentness fading into an 
unrealness, as pastness becomes prominent, and as we appreci- 
ate that the experience we have been calling ‘‘ present” is 
strictly speaking real only in what is an experience qualified 
by pastness. The breaking into prominence of futureness, 
and the consequent breaking down of the realness of the pre- 
sentness, is seen in the recognition of the fact, which comes 
to many of us especially if we are of scientific bent, that this 
present from one point of view has realness only as it points 
to an effect in the future, a view which is at the root of all 
teleological conceptions. 
Here we discern the importance of the fact, previously 
considered, that this presentness is always but a form of tran- 
sition between pastness and futureness. Thus it happens 
that just as soon as we appreciate an unrealness in connection 
with a present we tend to lose sight of the presentness ; we 
at once find ourselves looking upon it from quite another 
point of view, projecting it into another realm of realness. 
While it may still be appreciated as a state of mind which has 
presentness as a phase of thought, if at the same time it 
appears preeminently important in a realm of pastness it 
takes on the character of a reminiscence of what has been but 
is not now real as an experience, or as a pure imagination or 
fancy in the past; or if it appears preeminently important 
in a realm of futureness it then takes on the character of an 
  er nae 
peta
-P-A-G-E-441
  TIME AND REALNESS 427 
idea of what is not now real as an experience, but of what may 
be looked forward to as possibly to become real: and these 
differences appear according as the pastness or futureness 
quality becomes marked when the presentness drops out of 
prominence. 
Just so far then as the presentness of a presentation becomes 
unstable ;—unreal,—just so far does the presentation it 
qualifies tend to lose its character as a present experience. 
Thus presentness comes to be closely bound up with real- 
ness ; and thus it is that when we consider the realm in which 
presentness prevails in comparison with the realms in which 
pastness and futureness prevail, these latter appear to fail of 
realness, although within their own realms more or less of 
realness is developed. That is to say, presentations qualified 
by either pastness or futureness may be in themselves very 
real, as we shall see in sections to follow ; but when compared 
with presentations qualified by presentness the past seems 
unreal, as what has been but is not now ; and the future seems 
unreal, as what is to be but is not now.? 
B. Realness and Pastness 
Sec. 6. If presentness is naturally appreciated as being 
closely related to realness, so that realness and presentness 
tend to vary together, we should expect to note that realness 
is less closely related to pastness and futureness, both of which 
are contradistinguished from presentness, and as opposite 
extremes in relation to this presentness which appears as a 
form of transition. In other words we should expect to be 
able to note varying degrees of realness in connection with 
pastness and futureness much more easily than in connection 
with presentness; and that this expectation is met in our 
experience is very clear. In relation to pastness, with which 
we are here concerned, we may take as an example the notion 
1Cf. Prof. Walter Smith, Philosophical Review, xi. 4, pp. 373 ff.
-P-A-G-E-442
  428 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
“the nebulous condition of the solar system.” This is a 
presentation in connection with which pastness is clearly and 
distinctly developed ; but it is one that is in but the smallest 
degree real for the average man, by whom it is thought to be 
scarcely more than a piece of scientific imagery. On the 
other hand such a presentation as that which gives a man the 
notion of his great-great-grandfather is as definitely qualified 
by pastness, and it is also very real. 
It would thus appear also that the pastness of a presentation 
does not in itself affect the realness of the presentation within 
the noetic system in which it is given, and this we should 
expect would be the case ; for a departure from the norm of 
fixed complexity, upon which departure in a given direction 
under our view pastness depends, does not necessarily deter- 
mine any special grade of the stability within the reflective 
field which determines the measure of realness. 
Sec. 7. That the realness of a presentation tends to attach 
presentness to a presentation we have already seen in Section 
3, and we should expect therefore to find that realness attached 
to a given presentation tends to go hand in hand with a loss 
of pastness. This we note in the proverbial difficulty we 
have in persuading ourselves that the markedly real occur- 
rences of the past are irrevocably gone when they involved 
our satisfaction. The illusions of the insane are frequently 
determined by placing in the present ideas which we know 
to be memories. We sane people constantly meet the same 
experiences when, for instance, in speaking of an acknow- 
ledgedly past experience, one says “It isall soreal! Iseem to 
see him now coming out of the house to meet me.” 
Sec. 8. As we have noted in relation to presentness 
(see Sec. 5 above) so here we must remark that the pastness 
of a given presentation as considered in retrospect, being 
itself a special “‘sense of relation,” must in itself be subject 
to variations of stability or realness, this variation being 
determined by the greater or less intrusion of the hitherto

tay
-P-A-G-E-443
a 
area 
eo TIME AND REALNESS 429 
unemphatic presentness or futureness some of which is always 
observable in connection with all complex presentations. 
In the case of pastness this variable realness gives us a special 
variable sense of relation, which we commonly describe as 
the sense of familiarity. This familiarity is observed in 
many grades of completeness ; we say that presentations are 
more or less familiar, that they have more or less of that 
“‘ warmth” of which Professor James speaks. 
That the distinct quality of pastness is always attached to 
presentations which are recognized as familiar is of course 
clear in the very fact that we without hesitation speak of 
them as re-cognized ; this term being applied to the so-called 
familiar presentations because so large a proportion of them, 
as we observe when we study them, are identical with what 
we appreciate to be “revivals,” these revivals being appreci- 
ated as such because they assimilate very fully with the forms 
of secondary presentations which are distinctly qualified by 
pastness rather than presentness. 
Sec. 9. The appreciation of familiarity involves, as we 
have just said, an assimilation of the familiar presentations 
with the forms of secondary presentations: but of still greater 
importance is the fact that it involves more or less of assimila- 
tion with the psychic system,—the Self, which when itself 
presentatively explicit appears as the empirical ego : hence it is 
that careful consideration shows us that this familiarity always 
involves an implicit sense of attachment to the empirical ego. 
I say implicit because this fact is usually entirely overlooked, 
although all will at once acknowledge the existence of this 
attachment when attention is drawn to it: for evidently the 
presentation if familiar must be familiar to me. 
When this attachment to the empirical ego becomes very 
explicit, and the whole state of pastness for me becomes 
noticeably real, then we gain something beyond this mere 
familiarity as we shall see in later sections.

430 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
C. Realness and Futureness 
Sec. 10. As we have seen in the opening paragraph of 
Sec. 6 above, we should expect to note varying degrees 
of realness more easily in connection with futureness than 
in connection with presentness ; and it is clear that this expec- 
tation is met in our experience. For instance, the presenta- 
tion which gives us our notion of the condition of this earth 
when, in accordance with the nebular hypothesis, the heat of 
the solar system shall have become dissipated, and our little 
world shall revolve a cold inert mass in the blackness of 
space ;—this presentation is one in connection with which 
futureness is clearly and distinctly developed, and at the same 
time it is one which is in but the smallest degree real for the 
average man. Such a presentation however as that which 
gives a man the notion of his own death is just as definitely 
qualified by futureness, but it is also much more real for all 
of us. But it is to be noted that even this notion of future 
death itself varies in degree of realness. As I write I find 
my thought recurring to the death of three of my esteemed 
friends who have fallen under the scythe of the destroyer 
within the last week ; and just now the thought of my own 
death in the future is brought home to me with a realness 
which would not have occurred before these sad events; it 
persists with a stability which gives it to-day a realness it 
did not have a month ago when its persistence was not occa- 
sioned by the remembrance of these immediate bereavements. 
Sec. 11. It would thus appear that the futureness of a 
presentation does not in itself affect the realness of the presen- 
tation within the noetic system in which it is given, and this 
we should expect would be the case, for the reasons stated 
at the close of Sec. 6. 
Sec. 12. As we have noted in relation to presentness and 
pastness so here we must remark that the futureness of a 
given presentation as considered in retrospect, being a special 
a.       ) 
een aoe si
-P-A-G-E-445
    TIME AND REALNESS 431 
““sense of relation,” must in itself be subject to variations 
of realness, this variation being determined by the greater or 
less intrusion of the hitherto unemphatic pastness or present- 
ness, some of which is always observable in connection with 
all complex presentations. This variable realness of the 
futureness also itself gives rise to a special variable sense of 
relation, and this we appreciate when we experience what we 
call an anticipation. This anticipatory characteristic is ob- 
served in many grades of completeness, and this because of 
the greater or less stability, or realness, which the futureness 
of the given presentation gains as the result of its more or 
less thorough assimilation with the whole existing noetic 
system. 
Sec. 13. The recognition of an anticipatory characteristic 
thus involves more or less of assimilation with the psychic 
system,—the Self, which when itself presentatively explicit 
appears as the empirical ego: hence it would appear that this 
anticipatory characteristic involves an implicit attachment to 
the empirical ego. This fact that the anticipatory presenta- 
tion is thus attached to the empirical ego is usually entirely 
overlooked, although all will at once acknowledge the exist- 
ence of this attachment when attention is drawn to it; for 
evidently the presentation if anticipatory must be anticipatory 
in relation to my future experience. 
When this attachment to the empirical ego becomes very 
explicit, and the whole state of futureness for me becomes 
noticeably real, then we gain something beyond this mere 
familiarity as we shall see in later sections. 
Il. Tue Reration ofr THE Time Quatity To THE 
Osject-SupjecT RELATION 
Sec. 14. Having discussed in the preceding sections the 
relation of the time quality to realness, and having already
-P-A-G-E-446
432 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
studied the relation of the time quality to manifoldness in 
Part 1. of the preceding chapter, we may now consider the 
relation of the time quality to that relation between realness © 
and manifoldness which as we have noted in Chapter xv. 
gives us the object-subject relation. 
As we have already seen, a relative lack of realness prevails 
in connection with the subject in this object-subject relation, 
and we may at once therefore turn to the consideration of the 
relation of the time quality to the object to which marked 
realness attaches. 
As appreciation of attention and of the object-subject 
relation tend to vary together, we should expect to find in 
the relation of the time quality to the object-subject relation 
certain similarities with the relation of this time quality to 
attention, and this expectation we find fulfilled. 
Sec. 15. As we have noted in the previous chapter that 
presentations in connection with which pastness is pre- 
dominant are with comparative difficulty maintained in the 
focus of attention, so here we should expect to note a com- 
parative difficulty in maintaining as an object a presentation 
in which the characteristic of pastness prevails. 
A simplifying complexity, to which under our view the 
pastness is due, involves in general a tendency to instability, 
and where the quality of pastness is predominant we should 
therefore be led to look for a low degree of that realness 
which brings into existence the object in the object-subject 
relation. In other words the past should be more easily con- 
sidered as subjective than objective; and that this accords 
with our experience is seen in the fact that we quite spon- 
taneously think of what we have of the past as a subjective 
record rather than as a somewhat set over against the subject 
as an object, which the former may influence or be influenced 
by. 
Sec. 16. We have also seen in the previous chapter that 
presentations in connection with which presentness appears ) 
} \ {
-P-A-G-E-447
  TIME AND OBJECT-SUBJECT 433 
have an especial tendency to be brought into the focus of 
attention, so far as they are determined by environmental 
stimulation ; but that, if we eliminate these environmental 
influences, presentations which have futureness tend pre- 
eminently to gain position in the focus of attention, as is 
evidenced by the very fact that the word attendere connotes 
an anticipatory aspect. We should expect then to find, as 
we know is the case, that presentations which are due to 
environmental stimuli,—our sensations and percepts,—and 
to which presentness is attributed, would be the most marked 
of objects in the object-subject relation; but that if these 
are eliminated from consideration, the presentations that have 
futureness would be on the whole those that are most com- 
monly objectified. 
That our sensations and percepts are our most distinctly 
objectified presentations will not be questioned. And I think 
it will also be agreed that apart from these sensations and 
percepts the objective situation is attached most markedly to 
what is of the future. The mere flow of thought which is 
looked upon as present experience, and from which sensations 
and percepts are as far as is possible eliminated, gives us 
reverie, day-dreaming, fancy, imagination, but usually does 
not distinctly involve a sense of the objectivity of the 
thoughts involved. Such is not the case however where 
these thoughts have futureness; then, as they gain promi- 
nence in the focus of attention, so they are brought into 
relation with the subject in the process of becoming objecti- 
fied: the attitude of the subject in relation to them becomes 
significant. 
If futureness involves a developing complexity in the 
presentation to which the futureness is attached, then it 
involves less of dropping out, and a greater permanency of 
certain elements ; it involves the relative stability of a core, 
if we may so speak, to which are added the elements which 
make the successive revived presentations appear progressively 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
434 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND I. 
more complex ; and it should in general therefore be con- 
nected in our minds with a sense of coming realness ; and 
this is certainly true. The future indeed is appreciated to be 
unreal in comparison with the present, although less so than 
the past is. But it is clear that the sense of realness as a 
possibility is brought to mind automatically in connection 
with the sense of futureness, in a manner contrary to our 
experience of pastness; for as we have seen above, where 
realness is emphasized in connection with pastness the presen- 
tation tends to lose its pastness. 
Sec. 17. In this division of our chapter we have been 
dealing with subjects which may appear more appropriate to 
Book 111. in which we consider the nature of the Self and of 
its simulacrum the empirical ego; for as we have seen the 
subject in the object-subject relation, when it becomes 
explicit, turns out to be this empirical ego. The intimate 
interrelation between the presentation and the Self is seen 
however in the fact that it seems impossible to pass from this 
consideration without the study of certain important states 
given by the establishment of the realness of the time phases 
themselves as attached to, and through the influence of, the 
empirical ego. 
III. Tue Action or THE Empirteat. Eco i 
Sec. 18. The above consideration of the relation of the | 
Time Quality of presentations to realness and manifoldness 
brings before us again two facts to which reference has already 
been often made: viz. (1st) that this realm of manifoldness | 
par excellence is the realm of inattention :—that is the | 
unemphasized psychic system as contradistinguished from the 
from the presentations + <if : and (2nd) that no presen- \ 
emphases within this system.- self as contradistinguished | 
‘ : ee | tation, and therefor -fesentative appreciation of any |

     general psychic quality can be what it is apart from some 
influence upon it from the psychic system, i.e from the Self. 
We are thus led to see that the Self must always be more 
or less implicated in the establishment of the realness of the 
time quality phases of any given presentation ; and that when 
this influence becomes explicit it must appear as the action 
of the empirical ego leading to the establishment of this 
realness of the special phase of the time quality ; that is, it 
must be appreciated as the welcome by the empirical ego of 
the pastness, or the presentness, or the futureness. But as 
we have already seen, the appreciated efficiency of the Self, 
as explicit in the efficiency of the empirical ego, in the estab- 
lishment of that realness which gives the objective attitude in 
the object-subject relation, is what we speak of as belief. We 
should therefore be led to look for manifestations of this 
efficiency of the empirical ego in belief in connection with 
the several phases of the time quality. 
Sec. 19. For the reasons given in the last paragraphs of 
Sec. 5, referred to in the next section, this firmly established 
realness of presentness as attached to me, and belief in relation 
to it, need not be expected to give us a modification of con- 
sciousness so markedly specific in character that it would 
acquire a definite name. The case is quite different however 
with the establishment of the realness of pastness and of 
futureness as attached to me; and here we might look for 
the appearance of distinctive modifications of consciousness 
sufficiently specific to acquire definite names. 
As we have already seen, presentations in connection with 
which realness and the pastness and futureness time phases 
are developed, and which also involve merely an implicit 
attachment to the empirical ego, give us respectively the 
recognition of familiarity, and of the anticipatory character- 
istic. When the realness of these pastness and futureness 
phases of presentations as related to the empirical ego 
h emphasized we should expect then to find the senses 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
  436 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL 
of familiarity and of anticipation gaining something which 
they did not before have; and in the establishment of this 
realness we would have the conditions of belief ; and if doubt 
were raised as to this realness of the time phases for me, then 
we should expect to find belief becoming explicit as the 
re-establishment of this realness by the influence of the 
empirical ego. 
Where the real pastness and familiarity of a presentation 
becomes thus established we have a Memory, in connection 
with which we experience belief if the realness of the pastness 
for me of the presentation is questioned. A memory is a 
revival to which is given a special form in that it is appreciated 
as real for me in past time, and is habitually believed in as 
such," 
Where the real futureness and anticipatory character of a 
presentation becomes thus established we have an Expecta- 
tion,” in connection with which we experience belief if 
question is raised as to the realness of the futureness for me. 
An expectation is a presentation to which is given a special 
form in that it is appreciated as real for me in future time, and 
is habitually believed in as such. 
Sec. 20. Before we examine these descriptions of Memory 
and Expectation we may say a few words concerning the 
relation of the several time phases to belief. 
Although the Self is always in some measure implicated 
in the maintenance of the realness of a presentation ; never- 
theless in certain cases this influence of the Self may, as we

published since this chapter was written, makes much of this important 
distinction between revival and memory which has for some unaccountable 
reason been too generally overlooked by psychologists.

have seen, be overlooked, so that we come to think that some 
presentations have realness quite irrespective of the action 
of the Self, this occurring especially in connection with marked 
sensational and perceptual presentations due to environmental 
stimuli. But these very intense sensational and perceptual 
presentations, as we have seen, give us our most vivid apprecia- 
tion of presentness ; and we should not be surprised therefore 
to find the establishment of realness in belief overlooked in 
regard to presentness ; even as we have seen that in relation to 
presentness voluntary attention is overlooked. Now we find 
John Stuart Mill? stating that every case of belief is either 
an expectation or a memory. This means in the first place 
that Mill recognized the close relation of belief to the past- 
ness and futureness time phases in memory and expectation ; 
and in the second place that he followed the natural inclina- 
tion of men in overlooking the relation of belief to 
presentness. 
In our studies in Book m1. we shall show that the Self 
is directly concerned with the establishment of the realness 
of presentness as well as of pastness and futureness. But 
here we shall confine our attention to those cases where pre- 
sentative emphasis is clear, and shall consider; 1st Memory, 
as involving the establishment of realness in connection with 
those complex presentations which we call familiar because 
they involve pastness and an attachment to the empirical ego ; 
and 2nd Expectation, as involving the establishment of real- 
ness in connection with those complex presentations which 
we call anticipatory because they involve futureness and an 
attachment to the empirical ego.

It seems perfectly clear that while memory and expecta- 
tion do not necessarily involve the recognition of belief, they 
do necessarily involve the conditions of belief ; for evidently 
while I do not specifically experience belief in relation to all 
my memories or expectations, nevertheless I cannot be said 
to remember or to expect unless if questioned I find myself 
willing to assert belief in the realness of the presentation 
attached to me, which is characterized by pastness in the case 
of memory, and by futureness in the case of expectation. 
IK A. Of Memory 
Sec. 21. According to the statements of preceding sec- 
tions a presentation becomes a memory when in connection 
with it both pastness and attachment to the empirical ego are 
explicit, and provided the realness of this pastness for me is 
firmly established. 
We may bring this clearly into view if we consider certain 
qualifications of presentations which approach the nature of 
the memory presentation as thus described. We experience 
certain presentations which we call revivals and which have 
a recognized pastness and attachment to me. But it is to be 
noted that if the presentation is a revival, and nothing more, 
neither the pastness nor the attachment to me are explicit in 
the presentative experience; so far as we recognize these 
qualifications of the presentation in calling it a revival they 
are appreciated by us, after the experience, by a tracing back 
of the presentation to the body of our experiences which we 
call our past. In fact a presentation wi. 4 has the character- 
istics that lead us to describe it as a rev val, is not as such 
necessarily even familiar. Not until the pastness anc the 
attachment to me become more or less explicit in th pre- 
sentative experience itself does the presentation gai this 
characteristic of familiarity. 
Presentations which thus display explicit pastnes: gain 
 
-P-A-G-E-453
  MEMORY 439 
more or less of this familiarity as the result of their more or 
less thorough assimilation with the whole existing noetic 
system: and as this noetic system when explicit appears as 
the empirical ego, this assimilation involves a more or less 
explicit recognition of a relation to ‘‘me.” ‘Thus the presen- 
tation ‘‘ my great-great-grandfather” has realness of pastness 
but no familiarity. The presentation ‘‘my father” has no 
more realness of pastness, but it has this sense of familiarity, 
and it is familiar evidently because it has the ‘‘ warmth” 
which implies an attachment to the whole psychic system, 
and is appreciated as directly related to me. This character- 
istic of familiarity is so common an experience that presenta- 
tions in which it does not appear are placed in a special class. 
A presentation which is vivid enough to attract attention, and 
which having pastness is found to lack this familiarity in 
relation to all pastness for me, is called a product of the 
imagination ; of which we speak again below. 
But when a presentation, which is familiar in the fact that 
it is appreciated as having pastness and as closely related to 
me, has its pastness for me made fully real, then we have a 
memory ; and when this realness having been disturbed by 
question is re-established by an influence coming explicitly 
from the empirical ego, then we find ourselves believing in 
the realness of the pastness for me, and we assert that we 
remember.’ As Prof. James says: ‘‘ Memory requires more 
than mere dating in the past. It must be dated in my past. 
In other words, I must think that I directly experienced its 
1Dr. James Ward (Encyclopedia Britannica. Article, p. 63) distinguishes 
. between recognition and memory, holding that “there is an actual re- 
membrance where the recognition is accompanied by a reinstatement of 
portions of the memory train continuum with the previous presentation 
of what is now recognized.” If we use the word familiarity in place of 
recognition, and note that what Dr. Ward calls the “memory train 
continuum” is involved with the explicit apprehension of the binding 
power of the empirical ego, there appears to be no opposition between 
his view and that here expressed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  440 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
occurrence. It must have that ‘warmth and intimacy’ which 
characterizes all experiences ‘appropriated’ by the thinker as 
his own”: i.e. the attachment to me must be explicit and 
real. 
Sec. 22. The most familiar of presentations for the most 
part pass without consideration ;—the more familiar they are 
the less is their familiarity likely to attract our attention: my 
familiarity with the appearance of my daily companions does 
not arise in thought naturally. And evidently this relation 
is one that should be looked for if our view is correct: for 
as we have already seen the most real of presentations fail to 
attract attention to their realness. On the other hand the 
close connection between memory and belief already referred 
to is also to be looked for: for this familiarity, so likely to 
pass unnoted, must be brought into prominence when doubt 
is raised as to the realness of the pastness: not until such 
doubt arises does the realness become explicit, and then only 
through its enforcement by the attachment of the presenta- 
tion to the empirical ego ; and then we have belief. Each 
memory is clearly appreciated as such only where a question 
is raised as to the realness of the pastness of the presentation 
for me; and in the acknowledgment that the presentation is 
a memory we express our appreciation of the fact that the 
Self, as explicit in the empirical ego, has resolved the doubt 
by establishing the realness in belief that this presentation 
was real for me in my past. 
If this view is correct our memories should be appreciated 
as more or less clear as such, according as the realness of the 
pastness of presentations for me is more or less clearly de- 
veloped, and is more or less clearly involved with the reaction 
1 Psychology, vol 1, p. 650. Prof. James’ language is here somewhat 
disconcerting ; for the word dating usually refers to something much more 
definite than is necessary to true memory. That which is dated is always 
an event. But I certainly can remember other things than events : e.g. my 
grandmother.
-P-A-G-E-455
  MEMORY 441 
of the empirical ego. And we certainly do experience certain 
grades of memories, if we may so speak: some are so firmly 
bound up with the empirical ego that they cannot regain mere 
familiarity—can never be dislodged as memories; while 
others seem but momentarily attached to, and then again 
detached from, the empirical ego, so that at one moment we 
are ready to say that we remember a circumstance, and then 
in the next moment find ourselves in doubt whether the 
presentation is more than a familiar one without explicit 
attachment to the empirical ego. Between these extremes 
there are an indefinite number of grades of certainty of 
memory. ‘The fact is, as Prof. Royce says,' that ‘‘ most of 
our memories of long past events are systematically, although 
very unequally, falsified by habit”; and this fact of which we 
shall present ample evidence as we proceed, is natural if our 
memories are due merely to such a realness of pastness as 
warrants our belief in their attachment to the me. 
Sec. 23. If memory is thus correctly analysed it is ap- 
parent that past experience will usually determine the existence 
of memories; for this past experience will naturally lead to 
revivals, which will be familiar if the past experience has been 
sufficiently momentous, or often enough repeated, and which 
may well gain the realness of pastness for me which is neces- 
sary if we are to experience true memory. But it is equally 
true that if this realness of pastness for me can be gained in 
any other way than by the actual experiences pictured in the 
given presentation it will still be a true memory, even if it 
has not as a whole been based upon an experience in the past 
like that to which it is referred. This is a fact of which the 
average man takes no account. He almost invariably assumes 
that his memories are a thoroughly correct record of this past 
experience: he is liable to think you are questioning his 
veracity if you venture to question the validity of his deduc- 
tion as to the occurrences of the past from his existing 
1 Outlines of Psychology, p. 238.

  442 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
memories. Yet nothing can be more certain than that our 
memories are very doubtful evidences as to the real nature 
of situations in the past; as is indicated by the ease with 
which the lawyer is able to obtain from honest men evidence 
of situations which never have occurred. Surely this must 
be expected to be the case if our memories are ‘‘ systematically 
falsified by habit” ; and all thoughtful men will agree that * 
“the veracity of memory is not absolute and is itself subject 
to a higher criticism. Our justification for regarding 
memory as in general accurate is briefly this, that by taking 
such a course we are best able to order and harmonize our 
world.” 
Sec. 24. It will be evident to the reader that the view of 
memory here presented is quite diverse from that conception 
of it which has long been, and still is, held by the mass of 
intelligent men, and which can scarcely be said to have been 
altogether abandoned by the best thinkers in our day, 
although all of the later psychologists of importance deal with 
the subject in a manner which if examined will be found to 
be consistent with the view here presented. 
This current conception of memory may not improperly 
be described as the ‘‘ storage warehouse theory.” According 
to it experiences of the Self are somewhere filed away for 
future reference in some manner, and are upon occasion taken 
out of storage by the Self, or in other cases come out of 
storage of their own accord. That this supposed mental store 
house, if it exist, is a poor sort of receptacle for our valuable 
psychic goods is clear from the fact that the experiences which 
are supposed to be placed in store escape often without our 
will, and even against our will, and present themselves out of 
bounds in the most unexpected manner, and without indicating 
in any clear way the character of the structure in which they 
have been laid away, or the nature of the management which 
has held them from escape for a time, and then has let them

-P-A-G-E-457
  MEMORY 443 
loose, or has apparently thrown them out with the sweepings 
and rubbish. 
It is clear also that the method of filing adopted must be 
a most absurd one from any modern business point of view ; 
for we often find it very difficult to get with any promptness 
that for which we have urgent need, if we are able to find it 
at all, notwithstanding that we have the very best of assur- 
ances that it has been placed in store and therefore cannot 
have been lost. Beyond this it is clear that the management 
of the business must be very carelessly conducted ; for when 
we find what we want we are often much surprised to discover 
that it has sadly deteriorated during its lying in store; the 
moth and rust of time have corrupted it to some extent 
always, and in many cases very seriously. Furthermore we 
usually find that we cannot draw it from its file without also 
dragging out extraneous matter which clings to it so closely 
as to be inseparable from it. 
But perhaps the reader will think that we should treat this 
theory with more seriousness ; and with seriousness we would 
therefore note that there is no body of writers who speak more 
freely of memory in terms of this storage warehouse theory 
than the neurologists, and those interested in psychophysics. 
But surely these are of all others the very men who should 
long since have protested against the absurdity of this con- 
ception. For it must be acknowledged that there cannot be 
any such method of storage in the nervous system as this 
psychological theory suggests. It is clear that each new 
stimulation X to the nervous system leaves it an altered 
system :—a system which has been so differentiated by the 
stimulus X to which its reaction has been R, that it is actually 
a new system which if again stimulated by X will no longer 
give the reaction R, but some other reaction R!. Now if 
this is true there can be no permanent somewhat, no persist- 
ing ‘‘m,” as some would have it, in the nervous system in 
any event, which is stored away for future use. That each
-P-A-G-E-458
  444 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
stimulation leaves its “ trace,’—i.e. produces its modification 
of the system, and results in a modification of the possible 
activities of that system for all time, is of course true: but 
this is far and away from indicating the existence of any 
possible method of neural storage, or any specialized deposi- 
tory for filing away experiences which certain skilled psycho- 
physicists have wasted their valuable time in endeavouring 
to locate. 
Nor do the psychic facts warrant us in clinging to any such 
absurd notion; for apart from the weaknesses of the hypo- 
thetical system of storage above referred to, it is as true of 
consciousness as of the nervous system, as we have seen in 
Chapter v., that no conscious state can ever recur in identically 
the same form. While it is true that each presentation leaves 
its ‘‘ trace,” i.e. produces some sort of permanent modification 
of the conscious system ; this is far and away from indicating 
the existence of any possible method of psychic storage. It 
is a fact susceptible of easy proof that very many memories 
are altogether different from the presentations which origin- 
ally occurred in experience as their basis; and we are never 
able to show a single case in which the memory does not show 
some loss of what we call the original experience, or some 
accretion during the time which has lapsed between the 
experience upon which it is based and its recall as a memory. 
What we commonly speak of as the power of “memorizing” 
is merely the power of accurate association in certain given 
directions. That this is true becomes clear when we note that 
what is often called ‘‘memorizing” is recognized to be 
nothing other than this mere process of associating, with 
which there is connected no true memory, as there is involved 
no attachment to the empirical ego. In such cases there is 
naught but a recall of certain presentations following upon 
the suggestion of others. 
This view is further corroborated by an observation of 
the limitation of what we thus improperly call memory, and
-P-A-G-E-459
  
MEMORY 445 
which we ought to speak of merely as power of recall. If 
we become capable of associating one idea A with another 
idea B, we in a measure obstruct the appearance of still 
another idea C in connection with A. What we carelessly 
speak of in these terms as memory is, as Prof. Bain says, “like 
a full jug into which we can pour water, but only by the 
displacement of some already there.” That is, habits of 
association which give us powers of recall in certain directions 
necessarily limit our powers of recall in other directions. 
Mental power goes not so much with an advance in the num- 
ber of lines of association as in the ability to arouse associa- 
tions of general relation: and the most capable man will be 
he who can recall not only the general relations, but also, by 
specific attention to any one class, the relations within that 
class. 
Sec. 25. It thus appears that our memories are a special 
type of revivals. Memories indeed are always revived pre- 
sentations, which arise according to the well recognized pro- 
cesses of association: but on the other hand not all revivals 
are memories. For it seems clear that three characteristics 
must be experienced in connection with a revived presentation 
if it is to be a memory; viz. pastness, attachment to the 
empirical ego, and a realness of the complex presentation as 
thus constituted : and such is not the case with a mere revival. 
The occurrence of these characteristics may be, and usually 
is, due to influences from past experience which may be merely 
implicit or may be explicit. But it is important to note that 
it may be due to recurrences which have no relation to the 
experiences which appear to be involved with the memory. 
Memories which are produced in this latter manner are what 
are usually called “‘illusions of memory,” of which we shall 
give examples below. Under our view these are true 
memories, but memories which have not been due to past 
experiences: inasmuch however as a vast proportion of our 
memories are due to our past experiences, we incorrectly judge 
 
-P-A-G-E-460
    446 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
that these special memories have also been due to past experi- 
ences of ours. The illusion does not inhere in the memory, 
which is itself valid as a memory; but in the judgment as 
to past experience which we make as the result of the memory 
experience. 
Sec. 26. If two of the three characteristics above referred 
to are found in connection with a presentation the addition 
of the third will make it a memory. 
A presentation may have realness of pastness, but in this 
fact it is not a memory; thus I cannot be said to remember 
my great-great-grandfather. But if to the pastness is added 
an attachment to me, the whole of this complex presentation 
maintaining its realness, then we have a memory. Let us 
suppose for instance that I say I do not remember my maternal 
grandfather, and that you call my attention to certain of my 
recollections of my earliest childhood, and among these recol- 
lections to the image of a very old man wheeled in a chair, 
or tottering around leaning upon a cane; and then suppose 
you prove to me that that man was my grandfather; then 
the presentation—the fact that I had a maternal grandfather, 
—which a moment ago was merely real in the past, has become 
real for me in the past, and I at once say ‘‘why of course I 
remember my mother’s father.” 
Under certain circumstances we are able to increase the 
clearness of a presentation as a memory by merely increasing 
the bonds of attachment to the empirical ego. We often 
appreciate presentations which are familiar, and desire to make 
clear the ground of this familiarity. If we hold them in 
attention until they assimilate more fully with that part of 
the field of consciousness which is apart from the focus of 
attention, we gain assurance that they are revivals ; and when 
finally by various steps, some of which are given in attention 
and others not, the bond with the empirical ego of the past 
becomes more or less completely explicit; then we say that 
the presentation is a memory which is more or less distinct.
-P-A-G-E-461
  MEMORY 447 
A good example of the artificial production of a memory 
by the addition, to a real past presentation, of attachment to 
the empirical ego is given in the common experience of the 
good story teller who in repeating over and over again the 
same tale attaches the details so firmly to his own experience 
that he learns to believe the incident to have occurred in his 
own life. I have an elderly friend, an accurate active minded 
man of affairs, not at all given to exaggeration, who in his 
youth visited some of the isolated coral reefs of the Pacific, 
and who for years has told a tale of having found buried in 
the sand, within an atoll, a bottle in which was contained the 
record of a wreck; and he has often described minutely the 
appearance of the bottle as he found it. But a year or so ago 
he became interested in reading over his old diary in which 
he had made record of his experiences on this voyage, and 
was much surprised to find a full description of his visit to 
the atoll, but no mention of his finding of the bottle. Then 
in the notes made some days after his visit he found a record 
of the fact that some of the sailors had made a subsequent 
visit to the atoll, and had brought back with them a bottle 
which they said they had discovered in the sand on the beach. 
His astonishment was great, but he at once realized that his 
memory had been produced, not by the past experience, but 
by the gradual full attachment to himself of a presentation 
correctly referred to the real past, only a small part of which 
however had been originally bound up with his empirical ego. 
Sec. 27. In the above section we have been considering 
cases where realness of pastness becomes a memory through 
the explicit attachment to the efficient empirical ego, and we 
may now turn to the study of cases where a real presentation 
for me becomes a memory through an added pastness. 
A presentation may be very real and thoroughly attached 
to the empirical ego, but this does not constitute it a memory. 
This is a matter of such constant occurrence that it seems self- 
evident. The thought ‘‘the writing on this page” is real 
 
-P-A-G-E-462
    448 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND I. 
for me, and is thoroughly attached to my empirical ego, but 
being recognized as present and not qualified by pastness, it is 
not a memory. The mere lapse of time will however make 
this presentation ‘‘the writing on this page” a memory, as to 
the realness for me is added the sense of pastness. 
Examples of the artificial production of memories by the 
addition of pastness to an experience which is real for me 
are given in those rather common cases where a present 
experience which is real for me is in some way displaced into 
the past, so that we become convinced that we have experi- 
enced it before, although evidence goes to prove that such 
could not have been the case. I recall once having entered 
for the first time a room in a college hall which had just been 
completed, in which a friend of mine was speaking ; and yet 
I felt the greatest certainty that I had seen and heard it all 
before. I could prove conclusively that I had never been in 
that room, or in any room like it; and that I had never 
before heard my friend speak in public: nevertheless the 
memory was just as clear as could have been any that was 
certainly the result of past experience. To a firm realness 
for me had been added a sense of pastness, the whole complex 
presentation maintaining realness, and at once it became a 
true memory. 
Such experiences as the one just described are probably due 
to sudden distractions of attention, which are connected at 
times with extreme excitement, or which may be caused by 
a momentary condition allied to coma. Under such con- 
ditions there being two disconnected successive experiences, 
in a third moment the presentation of the first moment is 
represented by a secondary presentation which is related to 
the secondary presentation representative of the second 
moment in the same form of incompleteness that would have 
existed had the first moment been an occurrence of long ago.! 
1Tt is to be noted here that not a few of the records made by the 
“Society for Psychical Research” are explicable as due to “illusions of 
 
-P-A-G-E-463
  
MEMORY 449 
Sec. 28. Beyond the cases of artificially produced mem- 
ories referred to in Sec. 26 and 27, we have a third type. 
A presentation may display pastness clearly, and may be so 
clearly attached to the empirical ego that it seems distinctly 
familiar, yet if this whole complex presentation involving 
pastness and attachment to me fails of completely firm realness 
it fails to bea memory. I meet a man on the street and find 
myself saying ‘‘I imagine I have seen that man somewhere 
before.” Here I surely have not a memory, yet there is a 
sense of pastness and an attachment to me, but the sense of 
realness fails. But suppose the man calls out ‘“ Hello Mar- 
shall! Don’t you remember me? I am Smith, Johnson’s 
brother-in-law. I met you at his wedding.” Then at once 
with the establishment of realness in the whole complex pre- 
sentation it instantly becomes a true memory. 
Examples of ‘the artificial production of memories by the 
accretion of realness are given in many of our self-deceptions. 
In such cases we keep our attention so closely fixed upon 
certain images of what might have been past experiences, and 
which we wish might have been real ;—that is we fix our 
thought upon what we wish were real and overlook so per- 
sistently the presentations that were actually real,—that 
presently the presentations which were not real become real, 
for us, in past time. They then become true memories ; and 
we then falsely judge them to have been based on real ex- 
periences in our past lives, as a very large proportion of our 
memories are. 
Sec. 29. The above considerations throw light upon the 
distinction between Memory and Imagination, to which we 
have already referred above. What we call our imaginations 
are exclusive of our memories. These imaginations as con- 
sidered in retrospect may have distinct pastness, but in this 
memory” of this type; which are true memories indeed, but memories 
that are not properly based upon the actual experiences in the past to 
which they are referred.

  past they are not real in the noetic system to which the 
empirical ego of the moment belongs, and are therefore not 
memories. If I in any way alter my egohood so that it is 
devoid of those qualities which contradict the realness for 
me of an imagined past presentation, it then becomes for the 
time being a true memory for that particular uncritical 
empirical ego. It is thus with many of the imaginations of 
dream land: when we catch the remnant of them in our 
waking hours we recognize them as imaginations ; yet we are 
able often to note that in that dream life they were apparently 
true memories. This is explicable in connection with the 
view here maintained ; for we can readily see that during sleep 
several relatively isolated true memories of the awake man 
may be made to produce combinations which for this awake 
man are inconsistent, and which he realizes to be totally unreal 
for him, although to the uncritical ego of dream life they have 
been fully real. This explanation indeed becomes more 
probable if we note that when we ‘‘ make believe” the process 
may be described in very much the same terms, inasmuch as 
we then voluntarily overlook inconsistencies which we cannot 
allow to pass in our ordinary practical active life; and then, 
when ‘we allow our imagination full play” as we say, we 
live in a life where these strange combinations of revivals 
attain a realness, and an attachment to the ‘‘day-dream” 
empirical ego, which leads us to treat them in the current of 
thought as though they were actual occurrences. 
Sec. 30. The cases referred to in Sec. 29 show clearly 
the action of the empirical ego in affecting the maintenance, 
through the process of belief, of a realness which is disturbed. 
We clearly “‘ will to believe” that the memories of our ‘‘ make 
believe” world are based on past experience. And even in 
relation to the cases of self deception referred to in Sec. 28 
we not infrequently are in a measure aware of our action in 
forcing the presentation to become a memory. Nor are we 
able to convince ourselves that the creation of artificial 77 
a ia
-P-A-G-E-465
  MEMORY 45% 
memory by the story teller referred to in Sec. 26 is always 
altogether unappreciated by the subject ; i.e. that he does not 
knowingly aid the formation of the memory which finally 
becomes so firm that he automatically judges that the occur- 
rences to which it relates have been part of his actual 
experience in the past. 
ai B. Of Expectation 
Sec. 31. If it is true that futureness is a phase of a general 
psychic quality which we call the time quality, which is contra- 
distinguished from the pastness phase of this quality, both 
being departures from presentness but in opposite directions 
as it were ; then we should expect to find certain correspon- 
dences between memory which relates to pastness, and 
expectation which as evidently relates to futureness. This 
we find to be the case. 
According to the statements of Sec. 19 a presentation 
becomes an expectation when in connection with it both 
futureness and attachment to the empirical ego are explicit, 
and provided the realness of this pastness for me is firmly 
established. We may bring this clearly to view if we con- 
sider the relation of expectation to anticipation. 
When the futureness of the presentation is explicit, while 
its attachment to the empirical ego is implicit, but implicit 
merely, then the presentation gains a characteristic which 
leads us to call it an anticipation. Thus presentations which 
display explicit futureness gain more or less of this anticipa- 
tory characteristic as they assimilate more or less fully with 
the noetic system in which they appear. But this noetic 
system involves what when presentatively explicit we call the 
empirical ego. This anticipatory characteristic therefore 
involves an implicit relation to “‘me.” This relation is not 
explicit in cases of mere anticipation, although when we con- 
sider anticipatory presentations objectively we note the
-P-A-G-E-466
  
  452 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
necessity of the relation referred to. .Thus the presentation 
“‘my great-great-grand children” has futureness, and real- 
ness, but no anticipatory ‘‘feel.” The presentation ‘‘my 
grandchildren” has no more of realness or of futureness, but 
it has this anticipatory “‘ feel,” and it is an anticipation evi- 
dently because it is implicitly attached to the whole noetic 
system and may be appreciated in reflection as directly related 
to me. 
But when a presentation which has this anticipatory char- 
acteristic, in the fact that it is dimly appreciated as having 
futureness and as related to me, has its futureness for me made 
fully real, then we have an expectation ; and when this real- 
ness having been disturbed by question is re-established by an 
influence coming explicitly from the empirical ego, then we 
find ourselves believing in the realness of the futureness for 
me, and we assert that we expect. 
As the explicit attachment of the real past to our empirical 
egos gives us memory ; so the explicit attachment of the real 
future to our empirical egos gives us expectation. And 
herein we have the basis of our appreciation of the close bond 
between memory and expectation, notwithstanding that they 
are evidently mutually exclusive,—notwithstanding that an 
expectation, as such, cannot also be a memory, as such. Of 
the dependence of expectation upon the previous experiences 
of life, and upon its memories, we speak below. 
Sec. 32. If an expectation is a presentation which has 
futureness, and a high degree of realness given with the in- 
herent and explicit attachment of the presentation to the 
empirical ego, then expectations should be appreciated by us 
as being more or less clear as such, according as their realness 
is thus more or less developed : and no one will deny that we 
experience various grades of expectation similar to those 
grades of memory above described. All presentations which 
are in attention naturally press forward in their development, 
i.e, have in them what may easily become an expectation. In
-P-A-G-E-467
EXPECTATION 453 
fact, as Dr. Stout! says: ‘‘the primary experience of ‘ future- 
ness’ . . . ., is involved in the essentially prospective nature 
of attention.” In most cases this fact is overlooked, for only 
in retrospect does this anticipatory aspect of our normal active 
states appear. 
Here again we may speak of the close connection between 
expectation and belief already referred to. The constantly 
experienced anticipatory characteristic of our presentations is 
likely to be overlooked in certain cases until some doubt is 
raised as to the realness of the futureness for me, and then the 
test of its realness appears in the presence of belief in this 
futureness for me ; belief, as we have seen, being the enforce- 
ment of the realness of the presentation by the action of the 
Self as explicit in the action of the empirical ego, in an act of 
will.? 
Sec. 33. It seems clear then that three characteristics must 
be experienced in connection with a presentation if it is to be 
an expectation: viz. futureness, attachment to the empirical 
ego, and a realness of the complex presentation as thus con- 
stituted. If two of these characteristics are found in connec- 
tion with a presentation the addition of the third will make it 
an expectation. 
A presentation may have realness of futureness but in this 
fact it is not an expectation. Thus the mere thought of the 
fact that you are a possible beneficiary of your rich distant 
1 Manual of Psychology, p. 391. Confer Sully, Human Mind, i. p. 151; 
also Jas. Ward, Encyclopedia Britannica Article “an event expected differs 
from a like event remembered chiefly in two ways,—in its relation to 
present impressions and images, and in the active attitude to which it 
leads.” 
2 As I have indicated, such cases of the attachment of voluntary action 
are only occasional, and I quite agree with Bradley (Mind, N.S. 44, p. 442) 
that it cannot be claimed “that in all expectation there must be will” 
(he uses this term as the equivalent of voluntary action) “or desire.” The 
attachment to the empirical ego may not involve any disturbance of the 
realness, and in such cases there will be no will act.

    454 QUALITIES OF GROUPS IL AND IL 
kinsman who must some day die and must leave his property to 
some one, is a presentation which has realness and futureness ; 
but the thought of yourself as a future beneficiary is certainly 
not thus far an expectation.. Let us suppose however that 
this kinsman tells you that he has remembered you in his 
will, then you at once, and ever after, experience as an expec- 
tation the thought that you are to receive a legacy upon your 
kinsman’s death ; and this change has been due entirely to 
the attachment, quite accidentally, to your empirical ego of 
the presentation which before displayed merely the qualities 
of futureness and realness. 
If one undertakes a piece of work which may possibly have 
an advantageous result in his own experience, he may start 
with the idea that this result is a mere possibility ; but if in 
the course of the work his thought often recurs to this pos- 
sible advantageous result he presently finds himself deeming 
it not only possible but somewhat probable ; and finally, if it 
fails to occur at the time of the possible fruition, he awakens 
to the fact that he has come fully to expect it. This is a most 
common experience in the life of any one, the student let us 
say, who with others enters a competition for a prize. He 
may begin his work with the full realization that his chances 
of winning are perhaps but one in twenty ; and he may make 
4 firm resolve that he will not care whether he wins or loses. 
But as his work proceeds he cannot help following out the 
natural current of his thought, considering what he will do if 
he should happen to succeed. Success may mean for him the 
choice of a profession, it may mean for him a career, or per- 
haps a fund for a much needed and delightful holiday trip. 
As the days pass he still keeps saying to himself that his 
chances are only one in twenty, and that he will not hope for 
success; but if he throws himself with full earnestness into 
his work with the intention of winning if in any honorable 
way he can do so, the possible result of his endeavor presently 
becomes thoroughly woven into the warp and woof of his
-P-A-G-E-469
    
  
EXPECTATION 455 
empirical egohood, and when he hears the announcement that 
he has failed to win the prize he finds to his surprise that he 
has come to expect fully to win, experiencing all the dis- 
appointment that could have come to him if no doubt of his 
winning had ever entered his head. 
It is in this manner again that we often sophisticate our- 
selves ; ‘‘the wish becomes father to the thought” ; we learn 
to believe that a certain result will surely obtain, through the 
process of longing for its fruition and letting our thought 
rest upon this fruition until it binds itself thoroughly with our 
egohood, until it becomes a full expectation. 
Sec. 34. Or again a presentation may be very real and 
thoroughly attached to the empirical ego, but this does not 
constitute it an expectation. It may be made an expectation 
however by adding the sense of futureness to it. Some years 
ago I had a severe persistent painful sensation which was very 
real, and as the reader can imagine very distinctly attached to 
my empirical ego. I thought it might indicate some serious 
organic trouble: but my doctor after a time traced it to an 
irritated spinal nerve and speedily cured it. The thought of 
this painful trouble was never an expectation up to this point. 
But one day I met my doctor who asked after my health, and 
whether I had had any recurrence of the trouble, saying ‘‘It 
sometimes takes a long time to get rid of these nerve irrita- 
tions, and you must not worry if it recurs.” He thus added 
to the realness for me the characteristic of futureness as a 
qualification of the presentation, and at once it became an 
expectation. Although years have passed since the occur- 
rence above mentioned, I cannot now think of that painful 
affection without at once wondering when I am going to 
experience it again. 
Sec. 35. Or again, a presentation may display futureness 
clearly, and may be so closely attached to the empirical ego 
that its anticipatory nature is appreciated ; yet if this whole 
complex presentation involving futureness and attachment to
-P-A-G-E-470
    456 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
me fails of completely firm realness it fails to be an expecta- 
tion. The thought of my death is a presentation which has 
futureness, and which is attached to me; but it fails of real- 
ness during a large part of my life, and is normally not an 
expectation, even though I have every reason to judge that it 
must eventually occur. If however this complex presenta- 
tion involving futureness, and attachment to me, attains a firm 
realness, then at once it becomes an expectation. Suppose I 
have what I think is some trifling indisposition, and suppose 
I overhear my doctor say to a member of my family, “his 
condition is much more serious than appears on the surface, he 
is in very great danger” ; then to the futureness for me is 
added realness, and at once I expect death. 
Induced expectations of this type are of very frequent 
occurrence in our every day life. We constantly are cog- 
nizant of presentations which appear at the start as mere 
future possibilities, for us ; but if such presentations are held 
sufficiently long in attention, until they are assimilated more 
fully, that is until they become more real, we find ourselves 
considering them to be more than mere possibilities, we find 
them becoming probabilities: and if this process is allowed 
to continue, if it is not met by contradiction, the probabilities 
become more and more certainties,—that is the presentations 
become more and more real,—until finally we find ourselves 
acknowledging that they have become true expectations. 
Before passing to the next section we may note that as in 
connection with futureness there is always involved a certain 
attitude of reaction, even though this is not always explicit ; 
so we should expect to find, as we do find, that there frequently 
is an explicit emotional attitude involved with expectation 
which, while not of its essence, nevertheless colors it with a 
tinge that is not to be found in connection with memory. 
Sec. 36. The cases referred to above show clearly the 
action of the empirical ego in effecting the maintenance, 
through the process of belief, of a realness of futureness 
 
-P-A-G-E-471
    EXPECTATION 457 
which is disturbed. The cases of self-sophistication men- 
tioned in Sec. 33 clearly involve in many cases the “‘will to 
believe” : and no one who has had knowledge of hysterical 
patients can hesitate to agree that in cases similar to that 
mentioned in Sec. 34 the production of expectation may be 
quite knowingly aided by the will of the patient who would 
gain the sympathy of others. So is it also in such a case as 
that mentioned in Sec. 35. A person who has suffered 
bitter loss not infrequently comes thus, through the wish for 
death, to expect early death, although perfect health shows the 
great improbability of such an event. 
Sec. 37. It isa matter of common remark that the width 
of the field of ‘‘the future” would be indefinitely smaller 
than it is, were it not for processes connected with, and de- 
veloped out of, past experience. It is not unusual indeed 
for psychologists to lay great stress upon the fact of the 
dependence of expectation upon our experience in the past, 
and especially upon memory as a record of this past experi- 
ence. If A, it is said, has in the past been followed by B, 
then when A occurs again, B will tend to appear ; and if the 
pressure of this tendency is sufficient then B will be what we 
call an expectation. 
But the above may be taken as a mere statement of what is 
ordinarily called the process of association: and we find then 
that our statement amounts to little more than if we were to 
say that an idea which is aroused by association under certain 
conditions is an expectation : and this of course is true. But 
it clearly is not true that these ‘‘certain conditions” are 
always due to past experience, and to implicit if not explicit 
memory ; and in fact under our view they are never more 
than indirectly connected with this past experience. If it 
were true that they were always thus due to past experience 
then surely we should find ourselves unable to account for 
the fact that we all expect so fully as we do occurrences, such 
as death, which we have never experienced, and which we can 
ee a
-P-A-G-E-472
458 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
only connect with ourselves by a process of thought: and 
especially unable to account for those constructed expectations 
which we have considered above. 
Our position may appear even stronger if we note a further 
point. Genetically speaking, the appreciation of presentness 
in the course of our development must be anterior to the 
appreciation of both pastness and futureness ; for as Bradley? 
well says ‘‘ to know the past or future as such is a hard and late 
achievement of the mind, for it implies an enormous degrada- 
tion of the present.” But beyond this, and genetically 
speaking also, the sense of futureness must be anterior to the 
sense of pastness: for clearly the coming to it (involving the 
increasing complexity of presentations) is more important to 
the developing consciousness, than the going from it (involv- 
ing the simplifying complexity) ; and therefore the futureness 
as such must in all probability have been noted before pastness 
as such was. As Hoffding? says, ‘‘If by memory is under- 
stood not only the power of reproducing and recognizing 
elements of consciousness, but also the power of becoming 
conscious that the elements reproduced were experienced in 
time past, then it is developed later than expectation.” 
What the conditions are which make a presentation also an 
expectation I have endeavored above to describe; and these 
conditions are the ones which at times give the expectant 
form to a presentation which is aroused by association that is 
dependent upon a past experience. Thus while a vast num- 
ber of our expectations are presentations aroused by associa- 
tions which are due to past experience ; and while it is true 
that our expectations, and indeed our whole conscious life, 
would be sadly crippled but for these associations; neverthe- 
less it is not true that mere association based upon past 
experience suffices in itself to account for the experience of 
expectation. An expectation is given by a special form of

presentation, whether the presentation is aroused by associa- 
| tion due to past experience, or whether it is created anew 
by untamiliar stimuli; and this special form is given in the 
fact that these presentations are real, in future time, and

CHAPTER XX 
A RECONSIDERATION 
I 
Sec. 1. In the preceding chapters of this Book 11. we have 
considered the nature of five general qualities discovered in 
all psychic emphases or presentations, and the relations exist- 
ing between them. It has been assumed that these general 
qualities are distinct from one another; that no one of them 
in any of its phases is identifiable with any other of them in 
any of its phases. And this cannot be questioned if we trust 
to introspection, which surely seems to tell us that Intensity, 
Manifoldness, Realness, Pleasure-Pain, and the Time Quality, 
are qualities very thoroughly diverse from one another. 
The basis of this distinct differentiation will become clearer 
perhaps if we set before ourselves a concise statement of «the 
nature of each of these qualities, in conjunction with the 
hypothetical neururgic characteristics with which each of them 
is supposed to correspond.

in one of two directions from this norm.

2. or, energy of stimulus equi-

reaction ; 
3. or, energy of stimulus more 
than equivalent to the 
energy of reaction.

2. or a stationary complexity, 2. or Presentness, where future- 
ness and pastness are both 
lacking, 
3. or a decreasing complexity. 3. or Pastness. 
Sec. 2. Assuming that it is agreed that these general 
qualities appear to be distinct from one another in introspec- 
tion, we may ask ourselves whether there is as clear a distinct- 
ness between the neururgic characteristics with which they 
are supposed to correspond. 
In the first place it is to be noted that the neururgic char- 
acteristics corresponding with intensity, and with pleasure- 
pain, are held to be elemental ; while the neururgic character- 
istics corresponding with manifoldness, realness, and the time 
quality, are held to be determined by the complexity of 
neururgic patterns. It seems clear that there is ground in 
this fact for the distinction between intensity and pleasure- 
pain on the one hand; and manifoldness, realness, and the 
time quality on the other. 
In the group of elemental characteristics, viz. intensity and 
the algedonic quality, there is ample reason for the distinct- 
ness of each, in the fact, that intensity corresponds with mere 
degree of neural activity, while pleasure-pain corresponds 
with the relation existing between any degree of neural 
activity and the efficiency of the organic part. 
Turning to manifoldness, realness, and the time quality, 
which depend upon the complexity of noetic and neururgic 
patterns, we find ample reason why manifoldness is distinct 
from both realness and the time quality, in the fact that mani- 
foldness corresponds with neururgic conditions which are 
necessary to the development of stability in a given minor 
neururgic emphasis upon which realness depends, and also 
necessary to those alterations of neururgic complexity upon 
which the time quality depends; the appearance of some 
measure of these latter two characteristics being possible in 
connection with any degree of neururgic manifoldness.    
-P-A-G-E-477
A RECONSIDERATION 463 
The basis of distinction between the neururgic character- 
istics which we assume to condition realness and the time 
quality does not at first sight seem so clear. Simplifying and 
developing neururgic complexity, corresponding with past- 
ness and futureness respectively, might be held to be identical 
with failure of stability corresponding with unrealness. On 
the other hand fixed neururgic complexity, corresponding 
with presentness, might be held to be identical with the exist- 
ence of neururgic stability, corresponding with realness: 
both realness and presentness might thus seem to depend 
upon the relative fixity of complexity. 
But upon closer consideration it appears clear that the rela- 
tion of neururgic fixity to complexity is diverse in the two 
cases. In the case of the conditions corresponding with real- 
ness we have in view the fact that what we call ‘‘ the same” 
partial neururgic emphasis persists through various successions 
of complexities, which may themselves differ as to the 
variation of degrees of this complexity. In the case of the 
conditions corresponding with the time quality on the other 
hand the fact in view is the nature of variability of neururgic 
complexity as observed in presentations in which may appear 
minor neururgic emphases which may vary as to stability in 
successive neururgic patterns. 
While thus the neururgic conditions of realness and of the 
time quality are closely related, as correspondingly we have 
seen realness and the time quality phases are closely related ; 
nevertheless there is ample reason for our clear distinction 
between the two neururgic characteristics which correspond 
with the clear distinctions noted in introspection between 
realness and the time phases. 
I 
Sec. 3. In closing this consideration of these five general 
qualities which we have described as attaching to all psychic 
emphases or presentations, it will be well for. us to recall
-P-A-G-E-478
  464 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
certain points made. We have seen that the conscious state 
of any moment may be described as a noetic pattern within 
which emphases of varied forms appear. These general 
qualities as experienced are such emphases of special types, 
and emphases which have a very special significance. What 
we mean when we say that they are general qualities of all 
presentations is that no noetic pattern in which any presenta- 
tion appears can occur without at the same time also 
displaying some phase of each of these five general character- 
istics, whether this is appreciated in reflection or not. In 
other words these general qualities are implicit in every 
conscious state in which a presentation is given. While in 
different moments other special forms of emphases of an 
indefinite variety may appear, with each of these special forms 
must also appear some one of the phases of each of these 
general qualities. 
Strictly speaking then, instead of describing intensity, mani- 
foldness, realness, pleasure-pain, and timeness, as qualities of 
special noticeable presentations or mental contents, it would 
seem more proper to say that these special presentations 
involve special qualifications of these five general forms which 
in one phase or another are always given in each moment of 
our conscious life. These general forms are always of the 
essence of each noétic pattern, diverse noetic patterns being 
differentiated by very special forms of emphasis which are, as 
it were, superimposed upon them; these latter special forms 
being not of a general nature, but unique and peculiar to the 
moment in which they appear, and not changing their nature 
as the phases of these general characteristics change. 
Sec. 4. In what we have said above we have been speaking 
of these general qualities as experienced. But this experience 
may be merely implicit and not explicit. When it becomes 
explicit, the phases of these qualities are held in attention, 
and observed in reflection, as they have been in the course of 
our previous study. They then become themselves special
-P-A-G-E-479
A RECONSIDERATION 465 
presentations of the narrower type, as we have from time to 
time noted in relation to each of the five qualities. They are 
then special types of those ‘‘ senses of relation” of which we 
have spoken so often ; and their special nature is given in the 
fact that they are always found wherever we look for them in 
reflection, as is not the case with the senses of relation which 
have led us to adopt the designative phrase ; e.g. the sense of 
likeness, the sense of equality, as well as what James calls ‘‘ the 
feeling of ous,” “the feeling of and,” etc., etc. 
This being true they themselves, as such special forms 
of presentations, must be pervaded, as it were, by these 
genera! qualities. For instance the appreciation of intensity 
as such, as a presentation, must itself be more or less intense, 
more or less manifold, more or less real, more or less pleasant 
or painful, and must display either pastness, or presentness, 
or futureness: so also the appreciation of pleasure as such, 
as a presentation, must be more or less intense, more or less 
manifold, more or less real, more or less pleasant or painful, 
and must display either pastness, presentness or futureness, 
just as any other presentation does: and the same may be said 
of the presentations involved in cases of the appreciation of 
any other of the various phases of each of the five general 
qualities. 
That is to say, where any one of the phases of these general 
qualities is appreciated as an emphasis or presentation within 
1 The appreciation of such a presentation as is involved with the recogni- 
tion of any of the phases of these general qualities must generally be of that 
moderately pleasant type which is the characteristic of our ordinary thought 
trains; and this is the case with the presentation involved when we 
appreciate either pleasure or pain as such. 
Following Kiilpe, Stumpf, in the article already referred to holds that a 
formidable objection to the view that pleasure-pain is a quality of presenta- 
tions is found in the fact that pleasures and pains themselves display the 
attributes intensity, duration, etc. It would appear from what is said in 
the text that this point is not well taken if our view is correct. Confer 
my article in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., January, 1909 ; and my discus- 
sion of this point in Chapter x1. Sec. 2. 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-480
466 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND II. 
consciousness, it must involve all the general qualities of all 
presentations, these however being not necessarily explicit, 
although always implicit, in the noetic pattern of appreciation 
as such. 
Il 
Sec. 5. If what has been said above is true it has a bearing 
upon one point in relation to the subject treated at length in 
Chapter v. of Book 1. where we considered the nature of what 
are usually spoken of as ‘‘representations.” We there saw 
that each so called ‘‘representation” is always a new and 
unique presentation, and is a very special and complex form 
of those presentations which we have called “secondary” 
presentations. We speak of such a presentation as an 
“image” or “representation” because in a moment of re- 
flection there appears an emphasis containing multiple minor 
emphases and a comparison, in which we appreciate ‘‘ what A 
was” (4), and the so called “representation of A ( «<),” and at 
the same time the sense of relation which I describe by saying 
that A is almost exactly «. 
Now it is clear that there is a gap of some kind between A 
and «, otherwise there could not be such a comparison. If 
the original A was a sensation there must be in the moment of 
reflective comparison an appreciated break between the exist- 
ence of the experiences which give me A “what A was,” 
and « the so called image of the sensation A: and this gap 
can only occur because some moments intervened in which 
the primary sensation A did not exist as a presentation within 
the given noetic patterns. 
But if the general qualities above considered are always 
experienced in every noetic pattern, as we have held, then in 
retrospect we should seldom find given in a distinguishable 
way, in the actual experience of any phase of any one of these 
general qualities, the reflective form of comparison above 
considered where J is related to «, and this because these

A RECONSIDERATION 467 
general qualities being always given the gap would seldom 
be discoverable in which the original A, being one of these 
general qualities, did not appear. 
This would mean that the experience usually described as 
“representation,” and which is so commonly noted in relation 
to the most prominent forms of presentations, viz. sensations, 
instinct experiences, thoughts, etc., etc., would not be easily 
noticeable with reference to the presentations given as senses 
of relation when we appreciate the general qualities here 
considered. That is to say we should expect to note that 
we do not find standing out clearly in experience the so called 
“images” or “‘representations” of intensities, or of mani- 
foldnesses, or of realnesses, or of pleasure-pain phases, or of 
special temporal qualifications, in the same sense in which we 
find the “‘representation” of the sensations, percepts, con- 
cepts, impulses, etc., etc. 
That this is true will I think be granted, although this fact 
has in general been overlooked except in connection with 
pleasure-pain. In relation to pleasure and pain it has been 
recognized, and it has been brought forward by some psycho- 
logists+ as a basis for a sharp distinction between the nature of 
our appreciation of pleasure-pain, (and ‘‘feeling” in general), 
on the one hand ; and the so called “‘ presentations” on the 
other ; a distinction which I do not consider defensible. It is 
clear indeed that in the same sense that we fail to appreciate 
1Confer James Ward’s view (Encyclopedia Britannica, Article “Psychology,” 
p. 67) to be referred to again in Chap. xxi. Sec. 20, where he says 
“Feeling . . . intervenes between sensory and motor presentations,” and 
“is not itself a presentation, but a purely subjective state. ... Feeling as 
such is, so to put it, matter of deing rather than of direct knowledge.” In 
my view Dr. Ward bases this statement upon the introspective fact that in 
states of self-conscious reflection, “feeling” does not often appear as an object 
in relation with the empirical ego, but attaches itself firmly to the empirical 
ego. But surely this gives us no ground for holding that “ feeling” cannot 
appear as a presentation to the non-presentable Self; a claim which seems 
to be made in the quotation above given.

  468 QUALITIES OF GROUPS I. AND IL. 
“representations” of pleasure-pain, we also fail to appreciate 
“representations” of intensity, manifoldness, realness, and 
the time phases. 
On the other hand, as we have so often noted, these general 
qualities as experiences are given in the same manner that all 
so called ‘‘ presentations” are given ; viz. as emphases within 
the noetic pattern of the moment ; and as explicitly considered 
in reflection we have as definite “‘ideas” of intensity, mani- 
foldness, realness, pleasure-pain,' and timeness, as we have 
of any specific sensational, instinctive, or ideational presenta- 
tions: and these ‘‘ideas” of these general qualities are 
secondary presentations, and may refer back to a previous 
reflective state of appreciation of the presence of the general 
quality under consideration apart from its mere experience ; 
and thus, although as we have seen above the gap between 
successive secondary presentations of these general qualities 
is seldom noticeable, and their appreciation as representations 
not distinct and clear, still they are observable if we will but 
use Care in introspection.

BOOK III 
THE SELF 
CHAPTER XXI 
THE SELF AND THE EMPIRICAL EGO. THE HYPOTHESIS 
Sec. 1. Ar the very beginning of this Book it is desirable 
to ask the reader to note that we are here concerned to study 
the nature of the Self as part of consciousness, and thus 
approach the subject from the standpoint of the psychologist, 
waiving altogether all metaphysical problems in relation to 
the Self. To distinguish these two points of view is not 
always easy, as any reader of current writings will easily 
perceive ; but it is clear that the metaphysical Self is a concept 
quite diverse from the Self assumed in psychological analysis ; 
although all philosophical and metaphysical considerations of 
the Self are necessarily based upon self-experiences with which 
as such the psychologist alone can deal.’ 
Sec. 2. The reader of Book 1. of this work cannot but be 
familiar with the hypothesis as to the nature of the Self which 
we are to examine in this Book. If he is not thus familiar 
I shall ask him to read Chapter 111. 
We have noted that the nervous system in man is a vast 
system of minor nervous systems enormously intricate in 
structural relationship ; and that the activity of the nervous 
system taken as a whole must be viewed in relation to this 
1Confer Miss Calkins, Philosophical Review, xvii. 3, p. 272.
-P-A-G-E-484
  470 THE SELF 
complexity. If this is true, and if the theory of a thorough- 
going neururgic and noetic correspondence is valid, then it 
would appear that consciousness must also be looked upon 
as a vast system of minor psychic systems of enormously 
intricate relationship ; and that the modifications of a given 
consciousness must be correspondent with modifications of 
the form of the total pulse of activity in the nervous system 
with which it is related. 
Sec. 3. When we study our conscious experience in reflec- 
tion we discover it to consist in the main of a continuous 
series of modified forms; or, as I prefer to describe it, of a 
succession of ever changing “‘noetic patterns” due to the 
varying emphasis of certain partial psychic parts, or elements 
so to speak, within the whole complex psychic pulse which we 
describe as consciousness. The parts of this series most 
easily noted we usually describe as a stream of presentations. 
But evidently this conception of a stream of conscious “‘ pre- 
sentations” assumes a somewhat of consciousness to which 
the parts of the flowing stream are presented. This some- 
what of consciousness to which the series of ‘‘ presentations” 
are given, is what we call the Self of the moment’s experience. 
Consciousness at any moment thus appears to consist always 
of a Self, and of a presentation to this Self. 
Sec. 4. Reference to the nature of the neural activities 
which are assumed to correspond with consciousness shows us 
very clearly that a presentation to the Self corresponds with 
an emphasis of activity appearing in some part of, and accru- 
ing to the whole pulse of activity in, the complex system of 
neural systems; or in other words that the presentation 
corresponds with a modification of the whole ‘‘neururgic 
pattern” of any special moment, which modification is due 
to the emphasis of the activity of some elements, or of some 
partial elementary system, within the total system of neural 
systems, this emphasis standing out in sharp contrast from the 
undifferentiable mass of unemphatic nervous activities.
-P-A-G-E-485
  THE SELF AND THE EMPIRICAL EGO 471 
By a most natural analogical deduction from this observa- 
tion we are led to surmise that the Self of each moment 
corresponds with the undifferentiable unemphatic activities 
of the great mass of the complex system of neural systems to 
which the emphasis of the partial activities accrues as an 
increment ; for if the Self is part of consciousness, yet is not a 
presentation, it must be an undifferentiable unemphasized 
psychic mass to which by special partial emphasis the presen- 
tation is given. 
The Self of any moment would thus appear to be identical 
with, and the same as, the ‘‘rest of consciousness” which is 
always acknowledged to exist even when the presentations 
given are most vivid; identical in other words with what I 
have called the field of inattention against which is contrasted 
the field of attention in experience. This is the hypothesis 
of which we have made a preliminary study in Book t., and 
which we are: here concerned to examine more in detail. 
Sec. 5. This hypothesis as to the nature of the Self is so 
clearly suggested by the study of the neural activities of man 
that one cannot but be surprised that it has not been developed 
very widely by psychologists. That it has not been thus deve- 
loped is probably due partly to hesitancy on the part of scientific 
psychologists to deal with a matter which has been discussed 
so largely by many metaphysicians from more or less mystical 
standpoints. But beyond this the student whose attention 
has been attracted to this view must always have been met at 
the start by a formidable obstacle which may well have appeared 
insurmountable to those unacquainted with the facts which 
have been made familiar to us by the investigations of modern 
neurologists. 
This obstacle appears in the fact that the theory thus sug- 
gested involves the view that the Self, just because it is the 
undifferentiable unemphatic psychic mass to which the em- 
phasized presentation accrues, cannot itself appear as a psychic 
emphasis or presentation, i.e. cannot be presented : or in other 
 
-P-A-G-E-486
  472 THE SELF 
words that it is what I call a non-presentable Self. But as a 
matter of fact in states which we describe as states of self- 
consciousness we do experience as a presentation what we call 
in every day speech the self,—the ego,—the I,—to which 
itself psychic objects appear to be given. And this fact 
surely seems at first sight to be incompatible with the theory 
under examination. 
This difficulty seems less formidable however when we 
consider that we have been led to look upon the nervous 
system as a vastly complex system of minor neural systems, 
and have seen that broadly systematized parts of these minor 
systems may act as unified masses, and that such a broadly 
systematized unit may display an emphasized activity as a 
mass, and that to this emphasized neururgic mass may accrue 
neururgic increments less complex and more clearly distin- 
guishable. And so, as we have seen in Chapter 11. to which 
I would again refer the reader, finding consciousness to be a 
vastly complex system of minor psychic systems, we are led to 
see that we should expect to find just such states as those 
which we describe as states of ‘‘self-consciousness,” in which 
would appear a presentation of double emphasis, one of the 
minor emphases within which would consist of a presented 
psychic mass of undifferentiable unemphatic parts which 
would be a simulacrum of the Self, to which the other minor 
emphasis would accrue as an object. And when we take this 
point of view we at once perceive that the I,—the ego,— 
the every day self,—with which in states of self-consciousness 
objects are contrasted, although it appears to be a simulacrum 
of the Self, is an ‘‘empirical ego” in all cases,—is a special 
form of the presentations to the Self, and is not the Self, as we 
shall see more clearly in the next chapter. 
It becomes evident therefore that the existence of the 
I,—the ego,—as a presentation is not necessarily a for- 
midable obstacle to the acceptance of the theory under con- 
sideration. For it is conceivable that the Self may be
-P-A-G-E-487
  THE SELF AND THE EMPIRICAL EGO = 473 
non-presentable, as the theory demands; and yet that to it 
the “empirical ego” with its objects may be given as a com- 
plex presentation, in a manner similar to that in which all 
other complex emphases within the field of attention are 
given as presentations to the Self. 
Sec. 6. It may be noted here that if this hypothesis is 
valid the empirical ego must arise out of the Self, and evi- 
dently we will thus be tempted often to fail to differentiate 
the two in our considerations. Thus we are all too ready to 
attribute to the Self characteristics which are discoverable 
' only in relation to the empirical ego. That certain of these 
characteristics of the empirical ego may also belong to the 
Self may well be true, and we shall attempt to show by indirect 
evidence later on that such is the case; but that they are 
immediately given in reflective experience, as is often stated 
and more often implied, cannot be true if it is true that the 
Self is in its very nature non-presentable. 
Sec. 7. I have above rather incidentally remarked that 
the presented empirical ego is to be looked upon as a simula- 
crum of the non-presentable Self: a point which perhaps 
requires a fuller explication. 
In the complex nervous system each minor system of the 
first order is made up by the correlation of minor systems 
of a second order; and each of these minor systems of the 
second order by the correlation of minor systems of a third 
order ; and so on indefinitely. The neururgic relations which 
make possible the correlated activities of any minor system 
are fundamentally of the same nature as the neururgic rela- 
tions which make possible the correlated activities of minor 
systems of a higher order, and of the nervous system taken 
as a whole. We may say then that any given form found 
in the activities of minor nervous systems may properly be 
described as a simulacrum of a similar form found in the 
activities of the nervous system taken as a whole. Thus for 
instance the activities in the ocular minor nervous system
-P-A-G-E-488
474 THE SELF 
may be looked upon as a simulacrum of the activities of the 
whole broad nervous system. 
Correspondingly we may say that the noetic situations 
within the minor noetic systems within consciousness are 
fundamentally of the same nature as the noetic situations 
within systematized consciousness as a whole. We may say 
then that any given noetic form found in a minor noetic 
system may properly be described as a simulacrum of a similar 
form found in consciousness as a whole. Thus it is that our 
experience of light sensations, displaying a focus within a 
field, is appreciated as a simulacrum of consciousness as a 
whole, which is described in ocular terms as displaying a field 
of attention in which a focus of attention appears. 
Now the empirical ego under our hypothesis is a form 
involving the presentation of a mass of undifferentiable 
psychic parts, emphasized as a mass, to which more definitely 
emphasized objects accrue. But the Self under our hypo- 
thesis, on a grander scale, is also a mass of undifferentiated 
psychic parts; these however so fail of emphasis that they 
cannot appear as presentations, even as a unified mass: and 
to this Self presentations accrue as objects accrue to the 
empirical ego. The presented empirical ego thus appears as 
a simulacrum of the non-presentable Self, as the objects con- 
trasted with the empirical ego appear as simulacra of the 
presentations to the Self. This point will be found to be of 
no little significance in what follows. 
Sec. 8. An indirect, yet a strong, corroboration of this 
general view, that the Self of any moment corresponds with 
the mass of unemphatic neural activities of that moment, is 
given in the fact that we very generally attribute to other 
human beings Selves similar in nature to our own Selves. 
I know that this conscious experience of mine is related 
in some way with the activity of a special human body, which 
I study objectively, and which has a unique character inas- 
-much as its activities evidently directly affect the nature of 
 
-P-A-G-E-489
  THE SELF AND THE EMPIRICAL EGO = 475 
the stream of presentations which are part of my conscious 
experience. But I notice other human bodies around me, 
and I hear them speak as my human body speaks, or act as 
my human body acts, in the expression of variations in the 
form of the stream of presentations which belongs to me ; 
and I am led thus to assume the existence, in connection with 
these other human bodies, of streams of presentations similar 
to mine. 
But I also assume that these very same actions of other 
individual men involve the existence in them of Selves; and 
this can only mean that their actions are the expression not 
only of their presentations but also of their Selves ; and that 
these presentations and these Selves of other men must be 
fundamentally of the same nature. 
If then our judgment in relation to the existence of con- 
sciousness in other men is based altogether upon our experi- 
ence of the nature of consciousness as it is given to ourselves, 
we have no valid reason for the assumption of the existence 
of other Selves than ours, unless we tacitly assume also that 
our own Selves are as much part and parcel of consciousness 
as is the “‘ presentation continuum” which we study in reflec- 
tion. If I assume also the existence of other Selves in 
connection with, these other human bodies, it is because my 
own Self is implicitly appreciated not only to be part and 
parcel of my consciousness, but also to bear a relation to my 
physical body very similar to that observed to exist between 
this body and the stream of psychic presentations, i.e. to be 
fundamentally of the same nature as the field of attention 
which is given in reflection.’ 
1 If consciousnesses exist in the animals we must assume that, althongh 
simpler than ours, they nevertheless correspond in some measure with 
our own. And so far as we grant in an animal’s conscious life the existence 
of something psychic corresponding with our “ presentation continuum,” so 
we are bound to conceive of this animal “presentation continuum” as 
standing in contrast with something psychic corresponding with the human 
Self. We are bound thus to assume that all animals which experience a

  476 THE SELF 
Sec. 9. It is impossible to study the nature of conscious- 
ness as given in reflection, as we have done*in Book t., without 
noting that as the various parts of the nervous system display 
a fundamental sameness of nature, and as a unity of process 
appears within the nervous system, so there must be a funda- 
mental sameness of nature and unity of process within 
consciousness.’ If this is true then the analysis of presenta- 
tions as given in reflection should indicate the nature of 
consciousness as a whole, inclusive of both the “empirical 
ego” and the Self. Such an analysis we have attempted to 
make in Book 1. 
In Book 1. and in the course of the analysis of presentations 
in Book 11., we have also considered, but merely incidentally, 
the nature of the empirical ego which as we have seen is but 
a special form of the presentations to the Self. The special 
stream of presentations must have Selves not fundamentally dissimilar from 
human Selves. 
It is true that as we descend lower and lower in the scale of life we find 
the nervous system of organic beings becoming less and less complex, and 
that we may conceive of an organism of so rudimentary a nature that an 
increment of activity in one part will affect all other parts of the system so 
immediately that the special activity of the part will not appear in contrast 
with any mass of undifferentiable activities. In such a case we would have 
to agree that the consciousness of the animal consists of mere “ sentience,” 
that in it no “presentation-continuum” and no Self are developed. But 
it is not at all certain that organisms exist of so simple a constitution, and 
we seem compelled to agree in any event that in all organic forms in 
which neural systems are developed there exist Selves of some grade, as well 
as “presentation continua” ;—Selves which must vary greatly in constitution 
and complication, and which in the lower forms of life must be very diverse 
from human Selves, 
Granting all this, it may well be doubted whether any animals, except 
perhaps those of the very highest orders, have consciousnesses in which 
complex presentations of the self-conscious order are clearly developed ; 
ie. whether they experience those special presentations which give an 
empirical ego and the subject-object distinction.

THE SELF AND THE EMPIRICAL EGO — 477 
study of the nature of the empirical ego has however been 
reserved for this third Book, because it appeared clear that, 
if it is a special form of presentation to the Self, its nature 
could not be adequately treated until we had considered the 
general characteristics of all presentations to the Self which 
stand out clearly in reflection. And this postponement seems 
the more fully justified because, if our theory as to the nature 
of the Self is true, and if it is true that the empirical ego is 
a simulacrum of the Self, then a study of the empirical ego 
should serve to disclose to us the inner nature of the Self 
which cannot be given as a presentation in reflection: for in 
accordance with our theory, as outlined in Chapter m1., as the 
empirical ego is constituted in its relations to its objects in 
states of ‘‘self-consciousness,” so the Self must be constituted 
in its relations to the whole reflective field, inclusive of the 
empirical ego and of its objects. 
Sec. 10. In relation to our hypothesis as to the nature of 
the Self it may be stated that the probability of its correctness 
has been greatly increased as we have proceeded with our 
analysis in Book 11. in which we from the start assumed this 
nature of the Self, and studied the nature of the presentations 
with this hypothesis in constant view. For it is surely no 
insignificant corroboration of the hypothesis that the field of 
presentations can be subjected to such an analysis as was there 
given to it without developing any formidable opposition to 
this hypothesis as to the nature of the Self thus assumed 
throughout our study. 
It is to be acknowledged nevertheless that this corrobora- 
tion of the theory as to the nature of the Self is indirect and 
so far inconclusive. And in truth we are compelled to face 
the fact that in the very nature of the case substantiation of 
the hypothesis must of necessity be thus most indirect, and 
must always remain so, for the simple reason that the Self can 
never be in and of the field of attention with which alone 
psychology can have direct concern. Indeed, were it not for     
-P-A-G-E-492
     THE SELF 
.< conception of the physical analogue of consciousness, 
which can be held in the field of attention for minute study, 
it would perhaps be impossible to develope the hypothesis 
at all. For it is by reference to this physical analogue that 
we gain the conception of the nature of the ego of self-con- 
sciousness as the correspondent of a highly complex psychic 
emphasis within a vastly more complex system of psychic 
systems ; and learn to look upon the empirical ego as itself 
a simulacrum of the true Self which under our theory cannot 
at any moment of its existence be directly given in attention, 
although its existence may be inferred by processes which are 
completely within this field of attention. 
Sec. 11. In what follows it remains for us in the first 
place to examine in detail the nature of the ego of self- 
consciousness, which we speak of as the empirical ego. If 
this empirical ego is a special kind of presentation to the 
Self, it should display in some form all of the qualities which 
we have held must attach to all presentations. If we find 
that it displays these qualities in such phases as its assumed 
nature would lead us to expect, then our view of its nature 
will be strongly corroborated. 
Sec. 12. But beyond this, if it is true that the empirical 
ego is a simulacrum of the Self, then the nature of the 
empirical ego as given in reflection should indicate to us the 
probable nature of the Self which cannot be thus studied. 
We must then enquire by indirect means as to the nature of 
the true Ego,—the Self. We must assume its nature in 
accordance with our hypothesis, and consider what will be the 
effects upon the presentations to it observable in reflection, 
if the Self is what we claim it to be under our hypothesis ; 
in other words we must ask ourselves whether the observable 
alterations of the field of attention ‘‘from within” as we 
say, are compatible with the hypothesis that this Self of each 
moment’s experience is naught but the field of inattention,— 
naught but the psychic coincident of the mass of unemphatic
-P-A-G-E-493
THE SELF AND THE EMPIRICAL EGO = 479 
activities of the neural system to which some specially 
emphatic neural activity appears as an increment, this speci- 
ally emphatic activity having for its psychic coincident the 
presentation within the field of attention. 
With this examination we must remain content. If with 
such study no opposition to our hypothesis appears, then we 
must assume it to be valid unless it is replaced by some other 
hypothesis which is susceptible of more accurate and direct 
proof.

  CHAPTER XXII 
THE NATURE OF THE EMPIRICAL EGO. OF “FEELING” 
I. Tue Empiricat Eco 
A 
Sec. 1. REFERENCE to introspection shows us that when 
presentations are exceptionally vivid, especially where they 
are due to the reception of stimuli from the environment, 
the empirical ego often does not appear at all in the field of 
attention. The vivid light, the crash of thunder, the cutting 
pain, the sharply marked thought which gives us the solution 
of a problem, appear as presentations to the Self which stand 
as it were alone. 
But when presentations whether of a sensational or non- 
sensational nature, are less vivid; and especially when, as 
less vivid, they are prolonged ; then very frequently we have 
the experience of self-consciousness in which these distinctly 
marked presentations appear as objects which stand in contrast 
with the every day self,—with the empirical ego which under 
our view is itself a presentation different from the object: or 
better, both the object, and the empirical ego with which the 
object is contrasted, appear as partial presentations to the Self 
within the whole presentative field—each being partial 
emphases in the total emphasis which distinguishes the noetic 
pattern of the moment.
-P-A-G-E-495
  NATURE OF EMPIRICAL EGO 481 
In current psychological writing the object thus related to 
the ego in cases of self-consciousness is often spoken of as 
the presentation to the self. Inasmuch as this ego appears 
itself to be a presentation to the true Self, I in all cases limit 
the use of the word presentation to describe psychic emphases 
as contrasted with the Self, and employ the word object to 
describe those psychic emphases which are contrasted with 
an ego in the complex presentations of self-consciousness. 
Sec. 2. The facts above described seem most natural 
when we study the neururgic conditions corresponding with 
the states of consciousness under consideration, in connection 
with our hypothesis as to the nature of the empirical ego. 
For when a vivid sensation is experienced a very limited part 
of the whole nervous system becomes very emphatically 
active, and this emphatic activity must stand out in sharp 
contrast from the mass of activities of the rest of the whole 
nervous system. When however the sensation is less vivid, 
or some other than a sensational element is given, especially 
if these less vivid psychic emphases are prolonged, then the 
emphatic activity of the limited part of the nervous system 
has opportunity to arouse to heightened activity a whole 
broad minor system adjacent, if we may so speak, to the part 
of the nervous system in which the main emphasis of activity 
occurs, and we should therefore expect to find in such cases 
a total emphasis of double nature in which the very marked 
and limited emphasis would appear as a minor emphasis, in 
contrast with a second minor emphasis which would consist 
of a broad undifferentiable mass. (Confer Chapter mt., 
Sec. 5 ff.) 
It thus appears that what is the object contrasted with the 
empirical ego in certain cases, may under many conditions 
appear, in practically the same form, as the whole of the pre- 
sentation to the Self. A sensation of light, a percept ‘‘ this 
man,” any special thought, may make up the whole of the 
presentative field ; or on the other hand I may experience the 
2H 
 
-P-A-G-E-496
482 THE SELF 
light as affecting me, the percept ‘‘this man” as related to 
me, the special thought as mine. 
Sec. 3. This being the case we should naturally expect 
to find, what we do find, that in states of self-consciousness 
the object contrasted with the empirical ego is wont to be 
more distinctly prominent than the empirical ego itself. We 
should not be surprised however to find the empirical ego 
often just as prominent as its object: and this we do experi- 
ence in all cases where self-consciousness becomes sufficiently 
clear for remark. But beyond this we should be led to expect 
that cases might arise where the empirical ego would become 
more prominent than its object,—when the empirical ego 
would become isolated, as it were, as the main part of, and 
almost as the whole of, the presentation to the Self. Such 
experiences we have whenever we keep in thought, and 
attempt to analyse the natsive of, the empirical ego as we are 
doing here ; although, relatively speaking, it is seldom that 
the empirical ego as such appears in isolation from the objects, 
which latter are in most cases in our experience the source 
of the appearance of the former. 
B 
Sec. 4. In undertaking the critical study of the hypo- 
thesis to which we are thus led we may in the first place 
properly appeal to introspective experience in a broad way 
and ask whether the ego of self-consciousness bears evidence 
on its face of being merely a special type of the presentations 
to the Self. 
“Tt is to the imperishable glory of Hume and Herbart 
and their successors” says Prof. James ‘‘to have taken so 
much of the meaning of personal identity out of the clouds, 
and made of the Self an empirical and verifiable thing.” 
That I do not often refer to the writings of these masters in 
what follows, and especially to those of Hume, is due in the 
1 Psychology, i. p. 336. 
 
-P-A-G-E-497
  NATURE OF EMPIRICAL EGO 483 
first place to the fact that our method of approach is very 
different from theirs, but especially to the fact that I wish to 
make much more than any of them have done of the clear 
distinction between the empirical ego and the Self. That it 
is difficult to maintain this important distinction appears in 
the very fact that so few careful thinkers have done so.’ 
Hume was surely concerned to consider the concept of the 
Self, and not the concept of the empirical ego of self-con- 
sciousness. But it is not clear that his critical analysis referred 
to other than the empirical ego. Prof. James in the passage 
just quoted states that Hume viewed the Self as an ‘‘ empirical 
and verifiable thing”; and although it might be possible to 
question the accuracy of this description of Hume’s position 
in this regard, it is clear that his language amply warrants 
the statement that he held such a view. I am concerned 
however to uphold quite another doctrine, viz. that while the 
Self is of consciousness it is not an empirical thing in the 
sense that it is “‘verifiable” in the field of reflection: that 
the empirical ego, or every-day-self,alone is thus verifiable, and 
that this empirical ego is not to be identified with the Self. 
These successors of Hume and Herbart who have empha- 
sized this doctrine have been many, but to none of them do 
we owe more than to Prof. James himself, whose analysis of 
the empirical ego of self-consciousness in Vol. 1. of his 
Psychology may well be read in this connection by all who 
follow the study before us. 
1Miss Calkins’ description (Journal of Philosophy, v. 3, pp. 65 ff.) of the 
characteristics of the self for instance is a description which can only apply 
to a definite presentation such as the empirical ego is. She describes it as 
persistent and in some degree permanent, and this is a characteristic 
appreciated only by comparison of revivals. So also she says that it is 
inclusive (i.e. “is a complex of ideas, functions, experiences”) unique, and 
has “relatedness with other-than-itself”: all of which characteristics must 
belong to presentations to the non-presentable Self. As Miss Calkins is 
dealing with psychology she doubtless has in mind the empirical nature of 
what she calls the self.

  ATi THE SELF 
No one can observe with any care that which we come to 
speak of as the me without noting that this me is a very 
variable thing, and in this we at once see a likeness with 
other complex presentations. We find ourselves at first 
thought accepting as part and parcel of this me a vast array 
of things which drop away from it as soon as we undertake 
to consider it at all closely. In our natural every day life it 
is true, as Lotze says,’ that, “whenever we bring a foreign 
body into relationship with the surface of our body—the 
consciousness of our personal existence is prolonged into the 
extremities and surfaces of this foreign body, and the conse- 
quence is feelings now of an expansion of our proper self, 
now of the acquisition of a kind and amount of motion 
foreign to our natural organs, now of an unusual degree of 
vigor, power of resistance, or steadiness in our bearing.” 
This Lotze proceeds to illustrate through a number of pages 
in his inimitable manner in connection with the dress we men 
and women wear, the hats we put on, the canes we carry, etc. 
It would indeed be appropriate to repeat his remarks in this 
connection in full could space be spared. | 
But it is not only the things which affect our bodies sensibly 
that we are wont to consider part of ourselves; we stretch 
beyond our bodies ; and think of the me as inclusive of what 
is related to me, of what is mine in some one way or another. 
-As Prof. James says: * “In its widest possible sense a man’s 
self is the sum total of all that he can call his, not only his 
body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, 
his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation 
and works, his lands and horses and yacht and bank account.” 
Sec. 5. Let a man however but attempt to analyse this 
crude conception of his me, and he at once finds it rapidly 
disintegrating before his mind’s eye, or perhaps we may better

NATURE OF EMPIRICAL EGO 485 
say dwindling away by a process of scaling off, as it were. 
For instance, almost all the matters referred to above in the 
quotation from James drop away in the course of such a 
process, and he perceives that the real me that is left is quite 
a different thing than it at first appeared to be. He finds 
that what has scaled off, so to speak, was a complex body of 
what were evidently presentations which in themselves were 
relatively clear and distinct, and which in the scaling off pro- 
cess become objects related to the empirical ego ; what is left 
of the me being a vague indefinite somewhat concerning the 
nature of which he cannot be at all sure, but which appears 
to be a centre of spontaneous activity. 
Whenever however, to quote Prof. James again, his 
‘introspective glance succeeds in turning around quickly 
enough to catch one of these manifestations of spontaneity 
in the act, all it can ever feel distinctly is some bodily process, 
for the most part taking place within the head.”+ And as 
the result of these observations it is not unnatural that Prof. 
James should say that ‘‘if the dim portions which I cannot 
yet define should prove to be like unto these distinct portions 
in me, and I like other men, it would follow that our entire 
feeling of spiritual activity, or what commonly passes by that 
name, is really a feeling of bodily activities whose exact nature 
is by most men overlooked.”?? 
But evidently all that we discover by this process of ‘‘turn- 
ing around quickly” is a new bit of what has scaled off from 
the me, a new bit of relatively clear stuff of the nature of a 
presentation or object which indeed is scaled off with no little 
difficulty, but which nevertheless must be acknowledged to 
be of the same nature as those parts, of which we have spoken 
at first, which fall away very easily upon the most cursory 
examination. 
An opponent therefore is able to claim that the real me is 
not thus a mere mass of unemphatic minor presentations, but 
1 Op. cit. vol. i. p. 300. 2 Op. cit. vol. i. pp. 301 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-500
486 THE SELF 
is a somewhat different from these presentations, a some- 
what,—a core if we may so speak,—around which these 
presentations crystallize as it were. This supposition is 
rendered doubtful however by the observation that in the 
final analysis the elementary presentations which we observe 
by ‘‘turning quickly” vary in an indefinite number of char- 
acteristics ; and further and especially that they never seem 
to be able to scale off altogether or entirely, that they still 
seem to cling to this central core which itself has the “‘ feel” of 
being like unto them. 
Sec. 6. If we are still accused of taking too much for 
granted, of stepping beyond what has been actually proven 
by introspective observation, when we say that the me of 
self-consciousness is always and altogether an empirical ego 
made up of unemphatic minor presentations of the same 
nature as those which appear in self-consciousness as objects 
contrasted with the ego; we must ask our opponent to note 
that if the theory we present is valid we must always expect 
to fail to analyse perfectly the ego, if it be an empirical ego, 
into any specific elements which can be held in attention ; 
and this for the reason that although it is a presentation, in 
its very nature it always must remain an undifferentiable 
psychic mass to which accrue as objects these presentations 
that appear to scale off if we turn about with sufficient alacrity. 
Under our theory therefore the failure to analyse completely 
the nature of the me of self-consciousness is not a proof of 
its being other than an empirical ego, a view which as we 
have seen is suggested by every shred of evidence that 
introspection can give to us. 
‘We may note however that the view here upheld will be 
easier to maintain if it appears that the me as unanalysed and 
unanalysable displays all the characteristics which appear in 
those distinct presentations which in states of self-conscious- 
ness are given as objects accruing to the me; and in chapters 
to follow we shall attempt to show that such is the case.
-P-A-G-E-501

NATURE OF EMPIRICAL EGO 487 
Sec. 7. Here we may well refer to a current misconcep- 
tion which tends to prevent acceptance of the position here 
maintained. Those upholding this view are generally supposed 
to assume, because the presentations which scale off when we 
turn the mind’s eye around quickly enough are emphatically 
of a sensational nature, that therefore the empirical ego must 
itself be of a sensational natrre. But introspection gives no 
adequate basis for such a conveption ; for the me, which we are 
claiming to be an empirical ego, has a vaguer, fuller “feel” 
than we ever gain from mere sensational elements in attention. 
This difficulty is avoided under the hypotheses maintained 
in the earlier chapters of this work: for under our view all 
elements within the whole pulse of the psychic activity of 
any moment must have influence in determining the form of 
the noetic pattern of the moment. Thus although our sensa- 
tions, being our most easily revivable presentations, must in 
their nature be most prominent among those “scales” which 
appear to fall away upon our quick turning, on the sly if we 
may so speak, to view what we hold to be but an empirical 
ego; nevertheless we must assume that there are other than 
sensational elements which pervade the emphases within the 
noetic pattern of the moment in which these scales are brought 
into attention. We must assume that the empirical ego, 
could it be completely analysed, would not be found to be 
necessarily made up wholly of what would be sensational 
partial elements ; but that it would be found to be made up, 
partly indeed of elements which would appear as sensational, 
but largely of other than elements of a sensational nature. 
In truth this is evidenced by the very fact that the vague 
psychic mass, which we are maintaining to be an empirical 
ego, itself defies analysis; for when we attempt any intro- 
spective analysis we find that it is the sensational elements | 
that most readily break away from any psychic mass as objects 
of attention, while all else of consciousness fails thus easily 
to break away under analysis. 
a
-P-A-G-E-502
  488 THE SELF 
Sec. 8. It may be well here to consider one other view 
that has been brought into prominence of late years; viz. 
the view that the empirical ego is in a sense created by social 
conditions. Such a view is implicit in much current writing, 
and is doubtless thought to be implied by many readers of 
Prof. Royce when he says:! “‘Self-conscious functions are 
all of them, in their finite, human, and primary aspect, social 
functions, due to the habits of human intercourse. By means 
of habits gradually acquired, this contrast early comes to be 
extended to include that between one’s inner states and the 
represented realities which make up the physical world.” 
Here we must use care in the first. place to distinguish 
between the experience of the empirical ego in self-conscious- 
ness with which we are dealing, and the concept of the Self 
which is a quite different thing. My own Self is conceived 
objectively, just as the Selves of other men are conceived 
objectively. But in considering these concepts of the Self 
we are dealing with special presentations to the non-present- 
able Self, which are not such experiences of the empirical 
ego of self-consciousness as concern us here. It may very 
well be that my concept of my own Self is necessarily involved 
with concepts of related Selves,—is dependent upon the 
imagined criticism of ourselves by other Selves. But if we 
consider the nature, not of conceptual Selves, but of empirical 
egos, then it appears to me that we must hold that while the 
empirical ego certainly does for us mature men usually, and 
perhaps invariably, have some social reference; nevertheless 
it may often have practically only an object-in-the-outer-world 
reference, and I believe that for the common man this is very 
often the case. Beyond this it seems highly probable that 
in a race of individuals in which social relations were relatively 
very unimportant, a state of self-consciousness might be 
developed by mere contact with objective conditions. It is 
not difficult to conceive an early, prehuman, unsocial, isolated, 
1 Studies in Good and Evil, p. 196.
-P-A-G-E-503
  
NATURE OF EMPIRICAL EGO 489 
ancestor of mine, who may have developed states of self- 
consciousness and empirical egos by mere reference to objects 
in the outer world. And, as the human child probably passes 
through the stages of ancestral development in the unfolding 
of his life, I am inclined to believe that, could we read his 
infantile thought, we would find in him a vague recognition 
of the empirical ego due to mere contact with outer world 
objects, before social relations had in any measure colored his 
experience. 
Sec. 9. The empirical ego, although an undifferentiable 
systematized psychic mass, appears to rise out of the field 
of inattention as a unified presentation because this mass is not 
thoroughly coordinated with the whole psychic system. 
When we study any highly organized animal and consider the 
conditions of its life, we note that in it the neural activities 
of such a broadly related minor system as we assume to 
correspond with the appearance of the empirical ego may fail 
of that thorough coordination of which we have spoken 
because they are called into action by related but variable 
stimuli; or it may be that the environmental conditions 
which they involve are relatively new in the history of the 
race to which the individual in whom they appear belongs: 
or it may be, and is likely to be, that a combination of both 
these situations exists. The related stimuli, thus variable, 
may call for reactions in a broad minor system which has not 
yet ‘‘gained its bearings” so to speak,—which has not had 
sufficient experience of these varying conditions of broadly 
related systemic stimulation to enable it to react quickly, and 
accurately, and without disturbance, to the variations as they 
occur. 
Such conditions of variable systemic stimulation, arousing 
to marked activity a broad minor neural system which is 
fully related, yet not thoroughly coordinated with the whole 
system, are well fulfilled in man by the stimulations reaching 
him, and calling for reaction, in connection with his relation
-P-A-G-E-504
  490 THE SELF 
to objects in the outer world ; and especially with his relation 
to such of these objects as are living beings; and still more 
markedly with his relation to those living objects which are 
of his own kind, and between himself and which exist what 
we call social bonds. Such a complex systematized neururgic 
increment as we have above described would be, under our 
theory, the coincident of the presentation in consciousness 
which we describe as an empirical ego: and we should there- 
fore expect to find the empirical ego in the mature man bound 
up indissolubly with, and actually seeming to be dependent 
for its existence upon, man’s relations with objects in the outer 
world, especially with those objects which are living and with 
which he is in contact, and most markedly with those living 
beings of his own kind with which he acts coincidently in 
what we call social unity. In other words we should expect 
to find, as we do find, that the experience of the empirical 
ego of the mature man involves always an objective reference, 
the implicit recognition of the world of objects around us, 
and very marked conceptions relating to living bodies, and 
especially to living bodies of our own type with whom we are 
socially connected. 
But while this is true, it is not at all clear that no empirical 
egos can be aroused in beings less developed than the mature 
man, or existing under other conditions than those by which 
the mature man is surrounded. It is not at all clear that 
empirical egos may not be aroused for instance by conditions 
in which the recognition of the existence of other selves is 
not involved.

“FEELING” 491 
Il. Or “ Fretinc” 
A 
Sec. 10. If our conception of the nature of the empirical 
ego is adequate then we might expect to find that the undif- 
ferentiable psychic mass of which it consists might at times 
be stimulated by influences within the system, rather than as 
the result of a limited marked emphasis which might itself 
under certain conditions appear as the whole of the presenta- 
tion to the Self. And in such cases the psychic mass would 
be likely to be even less clearly defined than in cases of 
self-consciousness where the empirical ego is brought into 
emphasis as the result of a relatively narrow major emphasis 
which appears as its object. If a presentation of this broad 
systematic nature did thus appear it would be expected to 
display in a general way the characteristics of the empirical 
ego. It would in general have, or would come to have, 
reference to other and more definite presentations ; and its 
reference to them would be experienced as of like nature with 
the relation between the empirical ego and its objects. 
Now just such an experience we have in what is commonly 
described as ‘‘ Gefuhl” by the Germans, and as ‘‘ Feeling”! 
by the English psychologists. If we may judge from the 
way in which men speak and write of it ‘‘feeling” is experi- 
enced by all of us as a vague, scarcely differentiable, psychic 
mass. To use Prof. Laurie’s words, it is “a vague indefinite 
diffused state of being” where ‘‘ nothing is differentiated.” ? 
1 As we shall presently see the word feeling is commonly used in a very 
vague and inexact way, and it may be well to note that where in what 
follows I use the word “feeling” thus placed in quotation marks, I shall 
mean to refer to the experience which leads men to use the term, and not 
to any special nature which may have been attributed to the experience.

492 THE SELF 
It is acknowledged by all psychologists to be very distinctly 
subjective ; i.e. it is acknowledged to be closely allied to the 
every day self,—or the empirical ego.1 Furthermore, while 
states of ‘‘feeling,”—what we call ‘‘ feeling attitudes,’—may 
arise without any original reference to ‘‘ objects,” they usually 
display a distinctly subjective reference towards presentations 
which are at the same moment clearly given in attention. 
If “feeling” is such a vague undifferentiable inexplicit 
psychic mass as we here suggest, then we should expect that 
while it would be aroused in some measure in connection with 
every state of reflection, nevertheless its presence might well 
be often overlooked. This quite accords with the fact that 
while on the one hand all important modern psychologists 
agree that some measure of “‘feeling” is present in connec- 
tion with each moment’s experience ; yet on the other hand 
the general presence of ‘‘feeling” has often been so entirely 
overlooked that it has been regarded by many. of the older 
psychologists as a special faculty of the Soul which only 
occasionally displays its efficiency. 
“Feeling” then may be defined as that form of presenta- 
tion which when it becomes more clear and distinct is trans- 
formed into the empirical ego,—the-every day self of the 
common man. The “feeling attitude” is the attitude of the 
empirical ego not yet become explicit: as is shown by the 
ease with which mere “feeling” gives place to the more 
clearly defined empirical ego; and by the likeness between 
the special efficiency of “feeling,” and the efficiency of the 
empirical ego when this latter does become explicit ;—a 
likeness which we shall illustrate as we proceed.

Sec. 11. ‘‘ Feeling” is so constantly referred to in modern 
psychological literature that it may be well to consider some-

Review, Nov. 1902, for a full statement of this generally accepted view.
-P-A-G-E-507
  
“FEELING” 493 
what at length the grounds for the acceptance of the hypothesis 
thus suggested. 
The word feeling is commonly employed with many quite 
diverse connotations. Dr. James Ward, in his Encyclopedia 
Britannica article so often referred to, has called attention to 
four such uses of the term, viz. as equivalent (4) to touch, 
(b) to the organic sensations, (c) to the emotions and (d) to 
pleasure-pain. To this list I would add (e) the use of the 
word to express what Ward would call mere presentation 
itself, i.e. mere cases of psychic emphasis according to my 
terminology, and which I shall speak of in what follows as 
mere emphatic experience as such. It is thus for instance 
that Prof. James uses the word in his Psychology where’ in 
searching for ‘‘some general term by which to designate all 
states of consciousness merely as such” he states his partiality 
for either “‘ feeling or thought,” and where again? he speaks 
of “‘feelings of relation,” and tells us “we ought to say a 
feeling of and, a feeling of if,” etc. 
The fact that this word feeling is thus employed would in 
itself make the problem as to the nature of what we call 
feeling sufficiently troublesome ; but an indefinite confusion 
is added when we find writers using the term in different 
senses at different times, and without adequate warning to 
the student.* I have just quoted Prof. James’ usage of the 
word feeling in his Psychology as the equivalent of mere em- 
phatic experience as such ; but surely this is not what he means 
by feeling in his Varieties of Religious Experience* where he 
tells us that “in religion feeling is deeper than intellect.” 
Nor does Prof. James stand alone in this ambiguous use 
1Vol. i. pp. 185 and 186. 
2 Pp. 245 and 246, 
S Because of this uncertainty and indefiniteness of meaning I have 
attempted throughout this work to avoid the use of the word feeling where 
I have been able to find any other word to take its place. 
* Chapter xviii. and index reference.
-P-A-G-E-508
    494 THE SELF 
of the term; a large proportion of our best psychologists 
must also plead guilty to the same indictment.’ 
In this connection I am constrained to enter a serious 
protest against such careless use of this term. Psycho- 
logists all too often speak of feeling as though the word 
referred to a perfectly definite mental state as to the general 
nature of which a common agreement has been reached: and 
have a way of referring to its efficiency without facing the 
difficulties of analysis which are presented to them. An 
equally strong protest may be made against the opposed habit 
of treating ‘‘feeling” as a state which must always remain 
utterly mysterious, unanalysable, and inexplicable ; those who 
treat it thus giving up all attempt to study its nature, and 
yet often making use of it as a basis of explanation. 
Having thus presented this difficulty I may be allowed to 
suggest a simple means of avoiding it which I find effective. 
It is simply this; when I mean emotion or passion, I use 
the words emotion or passion, and not the word feeling ; 
1To take a late instance; in the thirteenth chapter of his excellent 
Psychology, Prof. Angell uses the word feeling as he says (p. 257), “to 
designate in a general way those processes which represent and express the 
tone of our consciousness.” He does not give us any specific definition of 
the word tone, but he leaves us in no doubt by the context that he means 
by it the pleasure-pain aspect of our presentations. Yet he at once adopts 
the word affection as a synonym of feeling ; and the word affection cer- 
tainly has an emotional suggestion. Beyond this, while he happily separates 
his treatment of feeling as pleasure-pain as widely as possible from his 
treatment of the emotions, nevertheless we find many expressions which 
seem to indicate that emotions and feeling are identifiable: as for 
instance (p. 327) “the peculiar feeling which marks each emotion off from 
other emotions is primarily due to the different reactions which various 
objects call forth,”—(337) “When we speak of sympathy we sometimes 
mean to indicate a definite feeling which has many characteristics of 
emotion,”—“ the moral feeling of obligation or the feeling of conscience 
affords a further instance of our emotional psychoses.” In this last case it 
may be that feeling is used as the equivalent of mere emphatic experience 
as such, as it appears to be where he speaks in this connection of “the 
feeling of dependence” and of “ feelings of reverence and of faith.”
-P-A-G-E-509
  « FEELING” 495 
when I mean pleasure-pain I use the phrase pleasure-pain, 
and not feeling: when I mean mere emphatic experience as 
such I use some other word or phrase than feeling. When 
one has followed this rule he is surprised to find how seldom 
he actually needs to employ the word. 
Sec. 12. Let us now briefly consider the five usages above 
noted. 
a. and b. The common man may employ the word feeling 
to refer to touch, and to the organic sensations; but the 
psychologist soon finds himself avoiding this usage. We 
must agree that we shall be obliged in the end to ask how it 
happens that the term is thus applied by the common man 
to these special forms of sensation, but it is very evident that 
“feeling” itself is fuller and deeper than any special type of 
the sensations. 
e. In like manner we are bound in the end to ask how it 
happens that we so often employ the term feeling when we 
mean to speak of mere emphatic experience as such: but I 
do not think that any special student of this subject will deny 
that there is a psychic somewhat which is usually designated 
as feeling which is not mere experience as such, but a very 
specific kind of experience; and it would thus appear that 
if we are to apply the word to this very specific type of 
experience we are not justified in employing it when we refer 
.to experience in general. 
Sec. 13. Turning now to the use of the word feeling to 
refer to the emotions and to pleasure-pain, it may be well to 
note that we cannot allow ourselves to assume any form of 
total or partial identification of the emotions and pleasure- 
pain. The emotions, as we have seen, are one and all psychic 
coincidents of instinctive reactions of the organism as such ; 
they are a special type of instinct experiences. But certainly 
neither pleasure nor pain as such is the psychic correspondent 
of a reaction of the whole organism upon its environment, 
as becomes apparent when we consider that very simple forms
-P-A-G-E-510
    496 THE SELF 
of impression upon us may give us keen sensational pleasure 
or pain. ‘The most we can say is that our emotions are usually 
distinctly pleasant or painful: but even to this rule there are 
notable exceptions, as in the case of the usual forms of sur- 
prise, which is clearly an emotion yet is one that is usually 
classed as indifferent. It appears thus that in the analysis 
we are to make we must consider separately the application 
of the term feeling to the emotions and to pleasure-pain. 
Sec. 14. c. That a large number of highly intelligent 
people habitually identify ‘‘feeling” with their emotional 
experience is clear. We speak of the feelings of anger and 
of love for instance, and in this we surely mean something 
more than mere emphatic experience as such. Artists and 
critics of art for the most part use the word in this way ; for 
them the man who “‘feels” is one who is keenly susceptible 
to nice changes of emotional reaction. But careful considera- 
tion surely serves to show that the experience to which we 
refer when we use the word feeling is something quite different 
from emotion. 
I think it will be generally agreed, as we shall see in the 
next section, that “‘feeling” is very closely related with 
pleasure-pain. But if, as we have just said, the emotions 
are not to be identified with, or are not developed from, 
pleasure-pain with which ‘‘feeling” is thus closely related, 
then “‘ feeling” must be in some sense broader than the emo- 
tions, for it has to do with both the emotions and pleasure- 
pain. Beyond this the emotions being reactive experiences 
are only very indirectly influential in relation to the flow of 
thought ; while “feeling” is commonly appreciated as more 
than an immediate reactive experience, and as very directly 
influential in relation to the flow of thought. It is a well 
recognized fact for instance that ‘‘ feeling” greatly influences 
belief : but it cannot be said that our emotions in themselves 
directly influence our beliefs; when they influence them at 
all they do so indirectly through the arousal of this ‘‘ feeling» 
 
-P-A-G-E-511
  “FEELING” 497 
which is liable to appear in connection with some of them, 
but not with all of them. Love, fear, and anger thus indi- 
rectly influence belief : but so far as I can see such emotions 
as surprise and ennui, for instance, do not. 
So it would appear that what men mean by the word feeling 
is not emotion, although clearly emotion is liable to carry 
“feeling” with it. 
Sec. 15. d. When we turn to consider the identification 
of ‘‘feeling” with pleasure-pain, we meet with questions 
which require more careful study. 
Dr. James Ward speaks of pleasure and pain as “‘ feeling 
proper,” and as in this position he is in accord with not a 
few important psychologists, one who ventures to express 
unqualified dissent from this view, as I am compelled to, 
cannot do so without caution, nor without acknowledging at 
once that the fact that this notion is maintained by men of 
keen insight implies that we find in pleasure and pain a very 
clear exemplification of the special mental qualification of the 
state which might properly be designated as feeling ; and this 
as we shall presently see turns out to be true. 
If pleasure-pain is ‘‘feeling proper,” then it would seem 
either (1st) that all the special mental forms which we naturally 
speak of as phases of ‘‘feeling” must be distinctly pleasant 
or painful, or must be summations of pleasures and pains ; 
or else (2nd) pleasure-pain is the simplest form of ‘‘ feeling,” 
and in our complex life developes beyond this simple form 
into something radically different from pleasure-pain. Let 
us consider each of these hypotheses as briefly as may -be. 
Sec. 16. The first hypothesis need not delay us, for it is 
perfectly obvious that many of the special mental forms which 
we commonly speak of as feelings are neither appreciated as 
distinctly pleasant nor as distinctly painful, nor even as alge- 
donic summations ; but are often so thoroughly lacking in 
algedonic qualification that they are described as completely 
indifferent. 
21
-P-A-G-E-512
  498 THE SELF 
As we have seen we often speak of feelings of touch. But 
clearly the mass of sensations of touch determined by the 
clothing I am now wearing cannot be claimed to be either 
pleasant or painful; they are entirely “indifferent”? The 
same is true of the great body of organic sensations which 
I may note in attention at this instant if I choose to do so. 
And the same is as certainly true of a vast proportion of the 
psychic items which I have described as mere emphatic 
experiences as such. 
Turning to the emotions with which “‘feeling” is so 
often identified we find the same situation; for it certainly 
cannot be said either that all of them are pleasant or painful, 
or that they always appear as algedonic summations. For, 
as I have already said, surprise which is clearly an emotion 
is usually ‘‘indifferent,” so notably in fact that Bain takes 
surprise as the best example of what he calls ‘“‘ neutral excite- 
ment.” 
When we sift matters down we find that what is commonly 
referred to as feeling is really a special form of ‘‘ presentation,” 
a special psychic emphasis, a peculiar and significant mental 
item:' and as such it is qualified by pleasure-pain, as all 
presentations, or specific mental items are. But it is just as 
clear that other psychic emphases or mental items, our sen- 
sations of taste for instance, which are never spoken of as 
types of ‘‘feeling,” are also algedonically qualified ; and this 
fact in itself suffices to prove that ‘‘ feeling” and pleasure-pain 
cannot be identified. 
Sec. 17. We may pass then to the consideration of the 
second hypothesis; viz. that pleasure-pain is the simplest form 
of “feeling,” and that in our complex mental life it developes 
into mental forms which are radically different from itself. 
This seems to be the view very generally accepted by those 
1 This statement the reader will recognize as directly opposed to Prof. 
Ward’s expressed view : but I shall hope to reconcile it with his meaning 
later on,
-P-A-G-E-513
  « FEELING” 499 
who hold that in pleasure-pain we have ‘‘feeling proper,” 
although they treat the whole question with such vagueness 
that one can scarcely be too confident in this regard. At all 
events I am able to find no other hypothesis to justify their 
position, and it is one the acceptance of which is not unnatural 
for psychologists who in their youth were deeply influenced 
by the teachings of the associationists, and who thus became 
accustomed to treat the doctrine of mental chemistry with 
more respect than was its due. 
This view has an advantage over that first mentioned in that 
it does not demand that all “‘feelings” shall be notably alge- 
donic ; and in that it faces the fact that many such states differ 
radically from pleasures and pains themselves; while at the 
same time it recognizes the fact that what we call feelings 
are as a class notably pleasant or painful. 
But upon careful examination we do not find this second 
hypothesis in any measure satisfactory. Touch and the 
organic sensations, and the emotions, to which the term feel- 
ing is so commonly applied, while often noticeably pleasant 
or painful, vary very much from time to time in their alge- 
donic qualification ; the self-same sensations and emotions 
are sometimes pleasant and sometimes painful. And clearly 
this variation of algedonic qualification could not occur with- 
out any noticeable change in the nature of the mental states. 
referred to, if the pleasure or the pain were of their very 
essence. 
And turning finally to that mere emphatic experience as 
such to which the term feeling is often applied, we may note, 
as we shall see later, that there is some little ground for the 
assumption that this emphatic experience as such is developed 
out of what it may be held we have a right to call feeling. 
But to argue that this mere emphatic experience as such is 
developed out of pleasure-pain as “‘ feeling proper” involves 
at the outset a begging of the very question just here at 
issue, viz. whether pleasure-pain is “feeling proper”; in
-P-A-G-E-514
  
500 THE SELF 
favor of which position I am unable to discover any evidence 
whatever. 
If ‘‘feeling” is a special form of presentations, it is to be 
granted that it is one in connection with which pleasures and 
pains of marked form are commonly given: but there is no 
more reason for holding that “‘ feeling” as a distinctive state 
is anything that can be properly described as a pleasure-pain 
development, than there is for holding that psychic emphases 
other than “‘feeling,” all of which are also algedonically 
qualified, are developed from pleasure-pain. 
Cc 
Sec. 18. We have thus found that we gain no satisfactory 
result by an attempt to discover the essence of feeling in any 
one of those special mental items to which the common man 
applies the term in every day speech. Our study of the 
problem however certainly suggests that this “feeling” is 
distinctly noticeable in connection with all the special mental 
forms we have been thus considering, and we are naturally 
led then to ask whether there is any psychic characteristic 
which is peculiarly marked in connection with the special 
mental states to which the term feeling is so commonly 
applied. 
Such a characteristic I find in what we call ‘‘ subjective- 
ness” ; and in thus applying this word we express the fact that 
the mental states referred to bear very close relation with that 
special presentation, or psychic emphasis, which we describe 
as the ego of self-consciousness,—the empirical ego ;—the 
every-day-self of the common man. And this is exactly 
what we should expect to discover if our hypothesis as stated 
in Sec. ro is valid. 
Sec. 19. Let usat first note how true it is that this subjec- 
tiveness is involved with each of those mental items which 
are commonly described as types of ‘“‘feeling.” We have
-P-A-G-E-515
  
“FEELING” sor 
noted that in careless speech we often identify “‘feeling” with 
touch and the organic sensations. In such cases I think we 
usually use the word feeling to refer to mere emphatic experi- 
ence as such, to which usage we refer below. But apart from 
this, touch and the organic sensations are closely associated. 
with the body ; with which in turn, as we all recognize, the 
sense of subjectiveness is closely associated: in other words 
touch and the organic sensations are not naturally considered 
to have any extrinsic or objective connotations, as is the case 
with sensations of sight and hearing. That it is for this 
reason that the common man thus applies the term feeling is 
made clearer when we note that so soon as the psychologist 
comes to look upon touch and the organic sensations as objec- 
tive to the ego of self-consciousness he finds no more tendency 
to apply the term feeling to them than to sight or hearing. 
Our emotions, which are so often spoken of as feelings, 
are notably subjective, as involving the reaction of the whole 
psychic system upon perceptual states. 
The most frequently noted characteristic of our pleasures 
and pains, which Ward and others speak of as “feeling 
proper,” is acknowledged by those who uphold this view to 
be their subjective reference. 
And finally when we use the word feeling to refer to mere 
emphatic experience as such, when we say we feel cold, or 
feel despondent, for instance, we refer to what is inherently 
appreciated as our own, and disconnected from the part of the 
field of presentations which is identified with the field that is 
preeminently objective to the empirical ego. 
All this gives ground for the thesis, mentioned at the close 
of Sec. 10 that what we call feeling is that form of presentation 
to the Self, which if it could become explicit would appear as 
the empirical ego of self-consciousness. 
Sec. 20. Here it may be well to note that certain psycho- 
logists, of whom Dr. Jas. Ward may be taken as representa- 
tive, appear in opposition to this view in one particular. They  
-P-A-G-E-516
  \ 
502 THE SELF 
tell us that in their experience “‘ feeling” ‘‘ intervenes between 
sensory and motor presentations,” and “ is not itself a presen- 
tation, but a purely subjective state, at once effect of a change 
in receptive consciousness, and the cause of a change in motor 
consciousness. . . . Feeling as such is, so to put it, matter 
of being rather than of direct knowledge. ae 
In my view this language is liable to misconstruction. 
When I speak of “‘ feeling,” as I have above, as a presentation 
of a certain form I mean presentative in relation to the non- 
presentable Self. That “feeling” as experienced is a pre- 
sentation in this sense I think Dr. Ward could not deny. 
What he apparently means to indicate in the above quotation 
is the fact that in states of self-conscious reflection “ feeling” 
does not often appear as an object in relation with the em- 
Pirical ego, but breaks away from the object and attaches 
itself firmly to the empirical ego, or loses itself in the empirical 
ego, or appears as absorbing the empirical ego. This is 
clearly in accord with my own introspection, and is in accord 
with the thesis here presented. For under this theory “‘ feel- 
ing” is subjectiveness pure and simple ; and this means that, 
as the empirical ego becomes explicit, feeling necessarily 
attaches to, or is resolved into, the empirical ego. 
Sec. 21. That the doctrine of those who follow Dr. Ward 
has failed to carry conviction is evidenced in the fact that some 
of our ablest psychologists have in late years rejected it and 
have suggested others, which however appear to me to be 
equally unsatisfactory. Two of these, viz. those presented 
by Prof. Wundt and by Prof. Royce, seem to demand our 
consideration. 
Prof. Wundt looks upon “feeling” as a complex state 
which varies in three directions. 1. As to pleasure-pain, 
2. as to excitement-depression, 3. as to tension-relief. 
Now as we have seen ‘‘ feeling” does display the pleasure- 
1 Dr. Ward’s Encyclopedia Britannica Article, p.67. Italics mine except in 
case of word “ being.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
“FEELING” 503 
pain qualification: markedly ; but if Wundt’s position is to be 
maintained it would seem to be necessary to show, in relation 
to his first ‘“ direction,” that all pleasure-pain is ‘‘ feeling,” 
and this is not demonstrable. The pleasure experienced in 
connection with a sweet taste, taken in itself, is surely not 
broad enough to be described as “‘ feeling.” “‘ Feeling,” as I 
have said above, seems to me to be in itself a special form of 
presentation ; just as the empirical ego is a special form of 
presentation: and it certainly cannot be held that no other 
presentation than ‘‘feeling” is algedonically qualified. 
Of the second of Wundt’s “‘ directions” it may be said that 
excitement-depression is a distinctly emotional series, and as 
such is of course closely bound up with the empirical ego, 
and therefore, under our view, with “‘feeling”: but as we 
have already shown, in itself, as emotional, it cannot be held 
to be of the essence of this ‘‘ feeling.” 
In tension-relief, Wundt’s third direction, we have it 
appears to me a series which conditions the appearance of 
emotional states, of which we have just said all that is neces- 
sary ; but surely in tension-relief itself we have, so far as I 
can see, no essential qualification of ‘‘ feeling” as such. 
Prof. Royce! holds “tentatively” that “‘ our feelings differ 
from one another in at least two decidedly distinct and rela- 
tively independent ways.—First as to their pleasantness and 
unpleasantness,” and second ‘‘as being more or less either 
feelings of restlessness or feelings of quiescence.” As to the 
first point, what I have said above of the relation of ‘‘ feeling” 
to pleasure-pain will suffice here. As to the second point I 
can merely say that ‘‘ feelings of restlessness and quiescence” 
are emotional states, (if indeed the latter can be called a special 
state). Here Prof. Royce, it seems to me, falls into the 
common man’s error, as Prof. Wundt also does, of carelessly 
including the emotions with the ‘‘feeling states.” But the 
emotions (¢.g. surprise) do not in all cases have that clear and 
1See his Outlines of Psychology, pp. 177 and 178. 
 
-P-A-G-E-518
  504. THE SELF 
definite subjectiveness which leads us to describe our experi- 
ence as ‘‘ feelings” ; and if my analysis of the emotions as a 
special type of instinct-experiences is correct they certainly 
cannot be properly classed as states of “‘feeling proper.” 
That our emotional states are bound up often with “feeling 
states” is not for a moment denied, nor is it denied that the 
one may readily displace the other in attention. But to 
identify the two forms of experience seems to me to be a mere 
confusion. 
Sec. 22. Finally I may say a word in reference to the rela- 
tion between the thesis here suggested and aesthetic theory. 
The aesthetic experience of an appreciative person in the 
presence of a great work of art might well be described as a 
resolution of consciousness into ‘‘ pure feeling.” As I see a 
great Rembrandt or hear a Beethoven symphony, I am over- 
whelmed ; and in retrospect find my state of mind difficult 
to state in terms of normal experience; but all will agree 
that the state given is one to which we may well apply the 
term feeling ; in fact one might well call it a state of saturated 
“feeling.” And, as such “‘feeling” it is surely given as a 
presentation. At the same time self-consciousness seems to 
disappear. In the moment of my ecstasy ‘‘ feeling” is there, 
but I do not apprehend myself as appreciating the “‘ feeling.” 
Nor does my ego appear as discriminating. Beyond this the 
object which brings the feeling state becomes of no import- 
ance: I care not who painted, or who composed ; nor do I 
care through what means, or by the emphasis of what ele- 
ments, the entrancing result is gained. Self-consciousness is 
dissolved away, and in its place we have as a presentation that 
mere psychic mass which under my view is identical with 
“feeling.” 
Sec. 23. One point referred to above I must mention 
here in closing. Consciousness according to the view main- 
tained in this work is a vastly complex systematized psychic 
mass, in which during our active life psychic emphases occur
-P-A-G-E-519
“FEELING” 505 
which are commonly spoken of as presentations. And these 
psychic emphases, or presentations so called, must of course 
appear as arising out of this complex psychic mass. 
If any indefinite systematized psychic mass, narrower than 
the psychic mass as a whole, can itself appear as a presentation 
or psychic emphasis, we shall have in it a simulacrum of the 
whole broad systematized psychic mass out of which our 
normal flow of psychic emphases or presentations appears to 
arise. But under our hypothesis ‘‘feeling” is just such a 
minor indefinite systematized psychic mass which as a whole 
appears as a presentation to the Self, as a psychic emphasis 
within consciousness taken as a whole. We are therefore not 
surprised to find that careful introspectionists, men like 
Horwicz for instance," have been led to hold that in “‘ feeling ” 
we have the fundamental psychic situation out of which all 
forms of psychic emphasis or presentation arise.

  APPENDIX B 
THE QUALITIES OF PRESENTATIONS AS DISPLAYED 
IN THE EMPIRICAL EGO 
I. Tue Empiricat Eco anp THE GENERAL QUALITIES OF ALL 
PRESENTATIONS 
Ir the empirical ego is a special form of the presentations to the 
non-presentable Self, some phase of each of those general qualities 
which we have found to attach in one form or another to all 
presentations must necessarily be displayed in connection with it. 
Let us ask whether we find evidence in support of our view when 
we consider how far we should expect these general qualities to be 
emphasized in connection with the empirical ego, if it is of the 
nature we ascribe to it; at the same time attempting incidentally, 
in corroboration of our hypothesis as to the nature of “ feeling,” to 
show that the same relation which exists between the empirical ego 
and these general psychic qualities obtains between these latter and 
the realm of “ feeling.” 
4, The Empirical Ego and Manifoldness 
Sec. 1. If the empirical ego is an undifferentiable mass of unem- 
phatic psychic elements, and is the coincident of an undifferentiable 
mass of neural activities which is emphasized as a mass, then this 
neururgic mass must be made up of many neural activities of nicely 
balanced grade of emphasis. We should therefore expect to note 
that the correspondent empirical ego, while displaying an individuality 
of its own, nevertheless displays also a high degree of manifoldness ; 
and that this is a fact will not be questioned, when we consider how 
vague and indistinct, how broad and pervasive, it is.
-P-A-G-E-521
  
GENERAL QUALITIES AND EMPIRICAL EGO 507 
Sec. 2. This being true of the empirical ego, if we are correct 
in our view that what men call feeling is the empirical ego not yet 
explicit, then we should expect to find the realm of “feeling” in 
like manner vague and indistinct, broad and pervasive: which it 
surely is. 
B. The Empirical Ego and Intensity 
Sec. 3. We have seen in a previous chapter that noticeable 
manifoldness and noticeable intensity vary inversely. If then the 
empirical ego displays a marked degree of manifoldness, we should 
expect that nothing within the empirical ego would display a rela- 
tively marked intensity. That this accords with experience is 
indicated by the fact, noted above, that as soon as any such intense 
noetic emphasis arises within the empirical ego it scales off as it were, 
and becomes a recognized presentation, or part of such a presentation, 
which is distinctly differentiable from the empirical ego, and which 
may be appreciated as an object contrasted with the empirical ego. 
Sec. 4. This being true of the empirical ego we should expect 
to find, as we do, that the realm of “feeling” is not appreciated 
as developing any marked intensities within itself. It is true that 
we at times speak of intensity of feeling, but in such cases we use 
the word to refer to certain emotional states with which, as we 
have seen, “feeling” is without doubt closely connected, but with 
which it cannot be identified, 
C. The Empirical Ego and Attention 
Sec. 5. Although the empirical ego is distinctly qualified by 
manifoldness, and is not markedly intense as intensity is objectively 
measured ; nevertheless at times it might-well appear as relatively 
intense in contrast with a still broader field in which manifoldness 
is very markedly developed ; and as attention is our name for the 
appreciation of the relation of a special intensity to a broader field 
of manifoldness we should expect to find that the empirical ego 
may appear as an “object of attention,” just as all other presentations 
may so appear. And we of course do all experience the existence of 
the empirical ego as an occasional object of attention ; we experience 
it thus whenever we are markedly “self-conscious” ; the reader is
-P-A-G-E-522
  508 THE SELF 
now experiencing it thus if he follows my thought with introspective 
examination. 
But if the empirical ego is to be given in attention in isolation as 
it were it must be because at the time no special psychic element is 
sufficiently emphatic to appear as an object related to this empirical 
ego. If I wish to experience the empirical ego in itself I must cut 
off all emphatic stimuli reaching me from my. environment which 
compel attention to their psychic coincidents: and furthermore must 
artificially exclude from attention, by a process of concentration of 
thought upon this empirical ego, all less marked psychic emphases 
which would normally appear in the focus of attention, 
It appears thus that the more prominent this empirical ego is in 
attention the more will its objects be excluded. Evidently then 
where the empirical ego becomes prominent in attention we should 
look for disturbances of the normal flow of thought, and for failures 
of such accurate and effective reactions upon our environment as 
occur in the vast majority of the moments of life in connection 
with vivid attention to the psychic coincidents of stimulation from 
our environment, and to our bodily movements. We should 
expect therefore to find the person who is vividly self-conscious 
tending to lose control of his flow of thought and of speech, as he 
does in what is known as “stage fright” which so often overwhelms 
a speaker when he finds his attention concentrated upon his 
personality rather than upon the audience before him. We should 
expect also to find, as we do, the self-conscious person acting in 
manners strange and unpredictable: the most vivid sense of self- 
consciousness results in inefficient action in the emergencies of life : 
to be effective men, we must “forget ourselves,” and must keep 
before our minds objective presentations only. 
Sec. 6. If our view as to the nature of “feeling” is adequate 
we should expect to find that “feeling” also may be an object of 
attention, as is surely the case. But as this “feeling” is less clearly 
defined than the more thoroughly systematized empirical ego we 
should expect it to be less commonly found as an object of attention 
than the empirical ego itself: an expectation which is surely met in 
our experience. Beyond this, when “feeling” is very marked in 
attention, to the exclusion of objective presentations, we should expect 
to note derangements of our effective reaction upon our environment 
similar to those noted when we are markedly self-conscious : and it
-P-A-G-E-523
  GENERAL QUALITIES AND EMPIRICAL EGO 509 
is agreed by all that the man whose mental state is predominantly a 
state of “feeling” is not in good condition to cope with those emer- 
gencies arising in practical life which require delicate adjustments 
within the field of attention. 
D. The Empirical Ego and Realness 
Sec. 7, We have seen not only that each presentation as such has 
a measure of realness all its own, but that it is recognized as having 
more or less.of realness in relation to varied noetic patterns in which 
it may appear; if therefore the empirical ego is merely a special form 
of presentation it should display this characteristic of varying degrees 
of realness, ‘That it does so is seen clearly when we consider the 
phenomena of so called double consciousness, which we study more 
thoroughly in Chapter xxvi. Here one finds his egohood split up into 
what he cannot but think of as a double ego, or as two egos; and 
under our view we should naturally find ourselves asking which of 
these two empirical egos is the real ego, in most cases becoming 
convinced of the essential realness of one rather than of the other. 
Tt is evident not only that this happens to the person subject to 
changes of egohood under morbid conditions, but that it happens 
also in our normal life where the double egohood appears without 
our general recognition of it as such. From moment to moment 
we find ourselves looking back to the deeds of the past with shame 
and sadness, and claiming that they were not due to what we speak 
of usually as our “true selves” : they appear to have been the result 
of the efficiency of empirical egos which are unreal in comparison 
with the special empirical egos of reflection which are then real 
for us. 
As we have seen in Chapter xv., when the realness of a presenta- 
tion is distinctly appreciated we usually find ourselves noting the 
object-subject relation, without however necessarily appreciating the 
existence of the empirical ego, or its relation to the object. In this 
object-subject relation as thus noted the very real presentation stands 
out prominent but in contrast with and related to a broad field which 
displays marked manifoldness, and less of realness ; the very real 
presentation displaying what we term objectiveness, the less real 
field of manifoldness displaying what we term subjectiveness which 
is usually less explicit than the objectiveness. But the empirical 
ego is under our view just such a broad field which displays marked
-P-A-G-E-524
    510 THE SELF 
manifoldness, and we should expect therefore to find, as we do, that 
when the object-subject relation becomes clearly defined it involves 
the appearance of a clear case of self-consciousness in which the 
vague subject developes into the more distinct empirical ego. 
But if this is true then it must. be that in the complex presentation 
of self-consciousness the empirical ego has less of realness than the 
object: and this is a point which will not be easily acceptable to 
the average man who will be likely to say that if any one thing 
appears clear to introspection it is that the empirical ego is peculiarly 
and typically real. It becomes evident however upon further con- 
sideration that when on the one hand we thus speak of the empirical 
ego as very real, and when on the other hand we speak of it as 
unreal in relation to its object, we are describing very different 
presentations. In the latter case we are referring to the appreciated 
empirical ego in a case of self-consciousness. In the former case 
where the empirical ego’s realness seems so clear we are dealing 
with a concept of the empirical ego which is actually at the moment 
an object of attention, and as such may be, and often is, set over 
against an appreciated empirical ego in a self-conscious moment. It 
is this conceptual empirical ego, and not the empirical ego appreciated 
in the moment of self-consciousness, that we find so very real.1 
1 We may ask whether in accordance with our view we should expect this 
concept to be thus characterized by realness. Whenever we consider the 
nature of the empirical ego with care it evidently is for the moment the 
most emphatic part of the field of attention: we then view the empirical 
ego in itself as a totality, without comparing it with any part of, or with 
the whole of, its object. If this empirical ego is a broad undifferentiable 
psychic mass, then, although its elements must be constantly altering in form 
and intensity, they must alter in such minute degrees as to prevent any 
special emphasis of any one of the elements: for just so soon as any element 
is increased in its intensity to a noticeable degree it in that very fact “scales 
off” from the mass which is the empirical ego, and becomes part of the 
object contrasted with this empirical ego. When therefore we view this 
empirical ego in itself, as a totality, as an undifferentiable mass, without 
comparison with any part of, or the whole of, the objects related to it, it 
upon which our attention is concentrated must as a mass have a relative 
stability in comparison with any unemphatic object which may appear 
under such conditions of attention. It appears quite natural then that 
we find this sense of stability or realness to be emphasized in relation to 
our experience of the conceptual empirical ego.
-P-A-G-E-525
  ( GENERAL QUALITIES AND EMPIRICAL EGO 511 
But when we note a whole state of self-consciousness (i.e. both the 
empirical ego and its object) as the object of attention; then we 
should at times find cases of self-consciousness where this empirical 
ego is not the most emphatic part of the field of attention, and where 
therefore a larger measure of realness might very well attach to the 
object than to the empirical ego; in which case the realness of the 
empirical ego would appear to be diminished. 
That this does occur in our experience is very clear in the fact, 
already referred to in Chapter xv. above, that when we are con- 
sidering distinctly marked objects, in relation to the existence of 
their realness, we are wont to describe what fails of realness in them 
as “merely subjective,” i.e. as belonging to the empirical ego. The 
fact of this detachment of the psychic item from the whole object 
which is appreciated as real, and of the attachment of this item to the 
empirical ego, shows that the empirical ego in such cases is recognized 
to be relatively unreal, as is rendered the more clear when we note 
that in common language the term “subjective” is treated as the 
equivalent of “imaginary,” which latter word involves very generally 
the connotation of unrealness. 
If these views are correct we might expect to be able to discover 
cases where while still holding our attention fixed upon the empirical 
ego we nevertheless lessen its realness by thinking it into a noetic 
pattern in which it appears as but a part of a broader entity. This 
we do when we think of ourselves as but elements of a social 
consciousness ; or more clearly still when we look upon ourselves as 
but elements of a universal consciousness, or of an Absolute: and in 
such processes of thought we have a clear corroboration of our view. 
For in such cases we discover that the empirical ego slips away from 
its firm ground of realness; that our individuality appears unreal in 
comparison on the one hand with the social ego, if we may so speak, 
or with the socius to adopt Prof. Mark Baldwin’s term; and on the 
other hand still more unreal in comparison with that conception of 
the Absolute, which those who are able most fully to attain this 
position feel for the moment to be the only Real. 
Sec. 8. If we have thus stated correctly the relation of the 
empirical ego to realness, and if our view.as to the nature of “feeling” 
is adequate, we should expect to find, what we surely do find, not 
only that “feeling” as a mere presentation in itself has the same 
measure of realness that attaches to all presentations as such; but 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  512 THE SELF 
that when “feeling” stands in contrast with objectified presentations, 
a sense of relative instability,—of unrealness,—attaches to “ feeling ” ; 
it is likely then to be spoken of as “mere feeling” in contradistinction 
from what is real in the realm of objects ; and it is this contradistinc- 
tion that leads to the very general recognition of the subjectivity of 
“ feeling.” 
Noting that the more objective a presentation appears the less 
subjective it appears, we have an explanation of that supposed 
opposition between perception and “feeling” of which some 
psychologists have made so much.! 
E. The Empirical Ego and Pleasure-Pain 
Sec. g. If pleasure and pain as appreciated in connection with 
special presentations to the Self are determined respectively by the 
efficiency and inefficiency of the nervous activities co-incident with 
the appearance of the presentations, then the empirical ego as a 
special form of presentation should, when considered in itself, display 
in some: measure the pleasure-pain characteristics appropriate to its 
constitution as an undifferentiable psychic mass. 
In such an undifferentiable psychic mass the great body of psychic 
elements of which it is composed must be well-balanced as to inten- 
sity, and devoid of vividness. But pleasures as well as pains of any 
marked degree are bound up with distinguishable intensity of the 
psychic elements in connection with which the pleasures or the pains 
are appreciated. We should expect therefore that under ordinary 
conditions the empirical ego when considered in itself in attention 
would fail to strike the introspective observer as a presentation in con- 
nection with which distinct pain or pleasure is developed: should 
expect that it would usually display that summation of pleasures and 
of pains of exceedingly low degree, or that balanced condition of 
transition between pleasure and pain, which we speak of as indiffer- 
ence. I think it will not be denied that this expectation is in general 
fulfilled in the experience of every day life. 
It is conceivable however that a large proportion of the psychic

elements involved in the appearance of the empirical ego might be all 
very moderately pleasant or all very moderately painful, so that by a 
process of summation the whole empirical ego would appear to be 
pleasant or painful: We are not surprised therefore to find that we 
do at times note a distinctly pleasant empirical ego under certain 
conditions of unusual bodily vigor ; e.g. when one is exercising with 
moderation in a bracing atmosphere, the blood supply bounding for- 
ward to nourish the whole active organic system : if such cases the 
use of the surplus store of energy throughout the length and breadth 
of the nervous system being accompanied by a mass of pleasant 
elementary presentations among which are those which go to form 
the empirical ego. And this leads the man to exclaim that it is a 
delight merely to live ;—it is a joy merely to be the vigorously active 
psychic system of undifferentiable elements which constitutes his 
empirical ego;—his me is itself a distinctly pleasant preséntation. 
Similarly we note the existence of empirical egos which are summa- 
tionally painful, such as we appreciate under conditions of excessive 
depression, or of restraint from normal activities, as for instance when 
we are ill or weary, or when we contend against adversity or mis- 
fortune. Then it is that we enquire whether life is worth living; 
then in other words that we ask ourselves whether this painful 
empirical ego of ours is a thing we wish to perpetuate. 
Sec. 10. We have been speaking thus far in this connection of the 
empirical ego as it appears when it is the marked emphasis within the 
field of attention : but when we consider cases of full self-conscious- 
ness in which both the empirical ego and its object are within the 
field of attention the algedonic aspect of the empirical ego appears in 
a different light. The empirical ego is a complex mass of an 
indefinitely large number of psychic elements of relatively low degree 
of emphasis and hence undifferentiated ; while the object appearing 
as contrasted with the empirical ego consists of a relatively small 
number of psychic elements whose emphasis is of relatively high 
degree. Inasmuch then as pleasure and pain are under our view 
qualities inherent in psychic elements we should naturally expect in 
those cases where pleasure and pain are considered in themselves as 
related to the whole self-conscious state,—i.e. to both the empirical ego 
and its object,—that the masses of pleasure and of pain, as masses, 
would on the whole be more marked in connection with the broad 
empirical ego than in connection with the relatively narrow object. 
ak  
-P-A-G-E-528
  514 THE SELF 
It will of course be at once conceded that this expectation is fully 
realized : for it is very generally held by the psychologists of our time 
that pleasure and pain are pre-eminently subjective phenomena: and 
in terms of our theory this is merely equivalent to saying that when 
we consider pleasure-pain in itself, in relation to the empirical ego and 
its object together, the masses of pleasure and of pain attach so fully 
to the very broad empirical ego that the pleasure or the pain which 
may attach to the relatively narrow object is overlooked.! 
1 This subjectiveness of pleasure-pain is so often discussed as if it were an 
experience of unique type that it is worth while to note here that our usual 
appreciation of pleasure and pain as among distinctly subjective phenomena, 
and their corresponding exclusion from among objective phenomena, is 
quite comparable with the obverse fact that in our appreciation of intensity 
in the observation of attention intensity is usually noted as connected with 
objects, and as disconnected from the relatively vast mass of psychic elements 
which constitutes the empirical ego. 
But notwithstanding this fact that intensity, as appreciated in attention, 
is looked upon as for the most part bound up with objects, as distinguished 
from the empirical ego ; nevertheless it is generally acknowledged that this 
empirical ego itself may be, and often is, distinctly attended to. 
So in like manner, but obversely, while pleasure-pain is for the most part 
considered in itself as subjective, that is as bound up with the empirical ego ; 
nevertheless it is impossible to deny that pleasure-pain is often distinctly 
attached to the object, i.e. that it is often distinctly objectified. As we have 
already seen, the limits of pleasure-pain experience in connection with the 
object are narrow in comparison with the broad limits of pleasure-pain 
experience in connection with the empirical ego, and it is this fect that has 
led to a failure to note the occasional objectification of pleasure-pain. But 
where this pleasure, or this pain, is very vivid we do distinctly detach it. 
from the empirical ego, and look upon it as a quality of the experience¢ 
object ; as for example when one thinks of the pain of a wound as inheren, 
in that “object in the outer world” which we describe as our body; in. 
fact the man who has had a limb amputated frequently goes so far as to 
objectify a pain in space quite outside of his body as it exists. Confer Dr. 
Santayana’s definition of Beauty as objectified pleasure. 
This fact is again clearly evidenced by the persistent attempts to differen- 
tiate “physical pleasures” and “physical pains” from all other pleasures 
and pains. Those who defend this view would call all these other pleasures 
and pains subjective, and they at times designate them as unpleasantnesses 
and disagreeablenesses to distinguish them from physical pleasures and pains; 
that is to say, they hold that most pleasures and pains are attached to the

   Sec. 11. If the suggested likeness between the empirical ego and 
“feeling ” holds, then we should expect to find that while “ feeling” 
when considered in itself may be so mildly colored with pleasure or 
pain as to be called indifferent, yet in many cases the summation of 
the algedonic qualities in the broad psychic mass will make “feeling” 
a source of powerfully massive pleasure, or of powerfully massive pain. 
This expectation is of course met in experience. That “feeling” is 
for the most part altogether indifferent, and is easily overlooked, is 
clear in the fact that many of the earlier psychologists spoke of 
“ feeling ” as a special faculty or state which only occasionally appears 
in experience ; a view that is now generally discredited. 
As we have seen, when pleasure-pain is considered in relation to 
the double aspect state of self-consciousness it is less closely identified 
with the object than with the empirical ego, i.e. is held to be especi- 
ally subjective. Similarly we should expect to find pleasure-pain 
especially identified with that inexplicit empirical ego which we call 
“feeling” ; and that it is thus identified is clear in the fact, already 
noted, that so many psychologists have held that “ feeling proper” is 
nothing more nor less than pleasure and pain. The fact that pleasure- 
pain has in general this subjective connotation explains also how it 
happens that so many psychologists are content to describe pleasure 
and pain as being essentially part and parcel of what is called the mass 
of “ feeling,” which under our view is nothing else than this empirical 
ego not yet become explicit. 
empirical ego, while the “ physical” pleasures and pains on the other hand 
are distinctly attached to the object of attention much as the sensational 
lifferential qualities of color, and warmth, and pressure, and sound, are 
tached to the object of attention. In this, these theorists clearly note an 
 ojective qualification of pleasure and pain. It is due to a strangely 
persistent error of interpretation of this introspective experience that so 
many learned psychologists describe pleasures and pains as sensational 
phenomena, and that such persistent and necessarily ever futile attempts 
have been made to discover some neural mechanism concerned in the pro- 
duction of these “ physical” pleasures and pains of a nature comparable with 
the neural mechanisms concerned with the appreciation of the sensations 
proper. For a fuller discussion of this question confer my Pain, Pleasure and 
Aesthetics, ch. i. sec. 4, pp. 15 to 32.

  516 THE SELF | 
F, The Empirical Ego and the Time Quality 
Sec. 12. The empirical ego, if it is a form of presentation, should 
display the time quality in such phases as are appropriate to the 
conditions under which it appears in attention. 
If we consider first the empirical ego in itself as definitely attended 
to, it will not be questioned that the empirical ego has the same 
characteristics that lead us to speak of all presentations as parts of a 
“stream” in time, or of a time flow. 
It is clear also that presentness is often definitely attributed to an 
empirical ego ; which leads us to think of it as here now. Equally 
clear is it that the empirical ego often has a distinct pastness qualifi- 
cation which leads us to think of it as of the past: in fact, as Sully? 
says, “self-consciousness, in its higher and clearer forms grows out of 
the memory of the past”; that is to say, without these experiences of 
the empirical ego which have the pastness qualification self-conscious- 
ness would not be what it is for us. 
Tt is not so easy however to distinguish the clear futureness qualifi- 
cation of the empirical ego. It is true that we often think of ourselves 
as likely to exist tomorrow just as we usually think of objects in the 
outer world as likely to exist tomorrow; but it is certain that the 
sense of the present and past existence of my empirical ego is much 
more fixed in mind as of its very essence, than is any sense of its 
future existence :? and the explanation of these facts is not far to 
seek. ‘The empirical ego is in its very nature distinguished by a 
well balanced degree of emphasis in an indefinitely broad system of 
psychic elements. On the other hand the characteristic which leads 
us to the recognition of futureness is a break in this well balanced 
1Sully, Human Mind, 1, 328. Compare J. S. Mill, Note to Jas. Mill’ 
Analysis, ch. v. p. 228. 
2 Yet it seems apparent that this futureness aspect of the empirical ego 
must be dimly apprehended by us, for otherwise it is difficult to understand 
the prevalence of the conviction of the immortality of the soul. I would 
not suggest that this conception of the future existence of the Self is rightly 
grounded on any such experience of futureness in connection with the 
empirical ego : but evidently the notion of a future continuance of a Self 
could not have found such common acceptance had not our introspective 
experience involved the appreciation of the anticipatory characteristic in the 
empirical egos of every day life.
-P-A-G-E-531
GENERAL QUALITIES AND EMPIRICAL EGO 517 
degree of emphasis, is a “budding” to use Prof. James’ word: and 
this budding as recognized at once appears, not as of the empirical ego, 
but as of the object contrasted with the empirical ego. 
Sec. 13. Turning now to the consideration of the temporal 
relations of the fully developed state of self-consciousness in which 
both the empirical ego and its objects are given in attention ; it is 
apparent that we are prepared to find with Dr. James Ward! that as 
introspective psychologists we must hold that time belongs “ neither 
to the subject alone apart from the object, nor to the object alone 
apart from the subject, but to experience as the duality of both.” On 
the other hand if the time flow is determined as we have held, by 
a form given by a special relation existing between the elements of a 
complex presentation, it cannot be expected to be noted distinctly 
except where the parts of the presentation as such are more or less 
emphatic. This emphasis of the parts of the total presentation is not 
characteristic of the empirical ego, and is characteristic of the object 
which is related to this empirical ego ; hence when we consider time- 
ness in itself in relation to the whole of the double field of self- 
consciousness, and when the empirical ego itself is not very distinctly 
apprehended, we should expect to find that the appreciation of time 
would be usually considered in connection with an emphasis of the 
object. I imagine that most of my readers will agree that such is 
the case. Those metaphysicians who defend the notion that the 
Self exists without relation to time are thus struck by no opposition 
in their every day experience to the view they uphold. In their 
thought, time is so closely attached to the stream of percepts and 
concepts, which are objects contrasted with the empirical ego, that 
they come to think of time as a form necessarily inherent in them 
alone. 
And yet under certain conditions we should expect to find this 
emphasis reversed. When the empirical ego is more prominent in 
attention than its object, the time quality asa whole might be expected 
to appear more emphatic in connection with the empirical ego than in 
connection with the object. For if the empirical ego is a psychic mass 
of undifferentiable elements of indefinite number, and of low ampli- 
tude so to speak, then the time quality, which is determined by the 
relation of the constantly increasing and fading elementary parts of 
the presented psychic mass, might be expected at times to catch 
1 Naturalism and Agnosticism, vol. ii. p. 149.
-P-A-G-E-532
  518 THE SELF 
attention, even where the elements in connection with which thi: 
time-flow is developed cannot be differentiated or observed as objects 
in themselves, In the same way, as we have seen, pleasure-pain as 
summationally appreciated is attached thus to the empirical ego. 
That this expectation is met in our experience seems to be indicated 
by the fact that a large number of philosophers have claimed that 
time is a form given to experience by the Self. Surely such a doctrine 
could not have been upheld so widely had it not corresponded with 
certain of the experiences of those who enunciate it ;—could not have 
been maintained had they not dimly grasped the fact that when the 
object of attention isa state of self-consciousness, i.e. an object related 
to the empirical ego, and a state in which the empirical ego is the more 
distinct in attention, then the timeness of the object in itse/f is unim- 
portant in comparison with the timeness of the empirical ego which 
seems to compel the object to assume the time-flow character if it 
would be assimilated and apprehended. 
Sec. 14. Turning to the relation between “ feeling” and the time 
sense, we note here again the likeness of this relation with that 
between the empirical ego and the time sense. “Feeling” as 
attended to, like all other objects of attention, displays the time flow. 
It is also well recognized as a present, and as a past form of experi- 
ence ; but it is not easily appreciated with a futureness qualification : 
we realize that we are now feeling, we recall that we have felt 
deeply, but we do not so often look forward with expectation to 
a future state of “feeling.”

Sec. 15. It will occur to the reader that if this empirical ego is 
of the nature above described then there is a large probability that the 
minor psychic system of which it consists must at times vary in the 
nature of the psychic elements involved, and that we should expect to 
find it tinged at times with those special qualities which we have seen 
are determined by the fact that the corresponding neururgic emphases 
occur in specially limited and differentiated neural parts. In other AGES EIRSSCT as caeen es

GENERAL QUALITIES AND EMPIRICAL EGO 519 
words we ought to be able to distinguish in the empirical ego, at 
times sensational qualities, at other times characteristics pertaining to 
our instinct experiences, and at still other times ideational qualities, as 
the field of attention is roughly divided into regions of sensation, of 
instinct-experience, and of ideation. 
Sec. 16. That we may experience as a presentation what we may 
call a sensational empirical ego is made clear by the analysis by Prof. 
James to which we have referred above, which seems in the main in 
agreement with common experience. He says} that for him, “the 
‘Self of selves,’ when carefully examined is found to consist mainly of 
the collection of peculiar notions in the head or between the head and 
throat. I do not for a moment say that this is all it consists of, for I 
fully realize how desperately hard is introspection in this field, But 
I feel quite sure that these cephalic motions are the portion of my 
innermost activity of which I am most distinctly aware.” 
It would appear that what Prof. James is here describing is really 
what I have spoken of above as the last observable scales which break 
off from the empirical ego as we study it in reflection, Although 
these are really just appearing objects contrasted with the empirical 
ego, nevertheless they are so intimately bound up with it that they 
surely indicate something of its nature ; and in such cases this nature 
seems to be very distinctly sensational. 
Sec. 17. The experience of a sensational empirical ego appears so 
very clear under such scrutiny as we have been describing that some 
men with Prof. James find it difficult to see that the empirical ego 
1 Op. cit. vol. i. p. 301. Prof. James’ introspection as above noted has 
probably been corroborated by the experience of many of his readers ; 
nevertheless I think he describes only a special case in which under a very 
searching examination the empirical ego appears as he describes it. One 
might agree that this empirical ego may indeed often appear to be of a 
sensational nature, and yet might hold that the limitation to “peculiar 
motions” in or about the head is often transcended in moments of less careful 
attention. Most noticeably when we are ‘falling asleep” for instance, but 
even now for me as I write, the empirical ego thus appears to be made up 
in an emphatic degree of a sensational content much more widely pervasive 
than the mere motor realm, It is identified with the whole broad mass of 
the body, and this is brought into attention principally by sensations indeed, 
-but by sensations which are localized in the trunk and arms and legs as well 
as in the head.
-P-A-G-E-534
  520 THE SELF 
is not always sensational in its nature : a little closer study however 
will serve to show that we experience empirical egos which are 
distinctly tinged by emphases of the instinct-experience, or of the 
ideational, types. 
It appears to the writer that the empirical ego of ordinary intro- 
spection, familiar to the psychologist, when he is not attempting so 
careful an analysis as that referred to by Prof. James in the quotations 
made aboye, is clearly an ideational empirical ego: and, on the other 
hand, that when we are emotionally agitated the empirical ego is 
distinctly pervaded by the special characteristics of the instinct- 
experiences (of which, as the reader will recall, the emotions are a 
special type), and of the impulses which are determined by the 
obstruction or inhibition of the natural outflow of the instincts. 
It is to these ideational and emotional empirical egos respectively 
in fact that unrecognized reference is made where the common man 
makes the distinction between the leadings of his “head” and of 
his “heart,” a distinction which was not uncommonly treated quite 
seriously by earlier psychological writers. His empirical ego at one 
moment is described as part and parcel of the head, and his empirical 
ego in another moment is described as part and parcel of the heart. 
By the heart he here clearly means his emotional experience, as he 
has learned to speak of the special perturbations of the circulatory 
system which go with emotional experience as descriptive of the 
emotional states themselves. By the head he as clearly means the 
ideational experience of ordinary introspection, having learned to 
speak of those disturbances which are localizable in the head, and 
which are emphatic when we “think hard,” as descriptive of the 
states involved with ideational experience. 
Beyond this, when we say that a given state is subjective in its 
nature we evidently mean that it is bound up with, and is of the 
nature of, the empirical ego. Now it is perfectly clear that we 
naturally speak of the reactive states, the instinct-experiences and 
emotions, and of the conative states impulses and desires, as subjective : 
that is we identify them with the empirical ego. 
Moreover the fact that we recognize an _instinct-experience 
emphasis in the empirical ego is evidenced in the modern emphasis 
of Will in many philosophical systems since Schopenhauer wrote. If 
Reality be conceived of as Will, and if the individual’s ego be 
conceived of as a special exemplification of the Universal Will, 
 
-P-A-G-E-535
— 
  GENERAL QUALITIES AND EMPIRICAL EGO 521 
then it must be that the one who follows this line of thought 
appreciates his empirical ego as definitely conative, as distinctly 
tinged with instinct-experience and impulse. But a consideration 
of similar nature shows us how certainly the empirical ego is often 
appreciated as of ideational type, in the fact that men of marked 
ability have upheld, and still uphold, systems of Idealism of an 
Hegelian type. If Reality is conceived as Idea, and if the individual 
is conceived as an aspect of this Universal Idea, then the thinker who 
upholds this view must find in his experience a close bond of unity 
between the nature of his empirical ego and the realm of thought,— 
of ideation. 
Sec. 18. If our view as to the nature of “feeling” is correct we 
should expect to find “feeling” somewhat commonly identified with 
our sensations, as we have just seen the empirical ego is thought of 
as of a sensational nature : and that such is the case is clearly shown 
in the fact already noted that the common man so frequently uses 
the word feeling when he would refer to touch, and the organic 
sensations, But that “feeling” is not appreciated as exclusively 
sensational is shown in the fact, also already referred to, that the 
word feeling is often used to describe mere experience as such, 
which of course includes presentations in the ideational and in the 
reactive realms, That “feeling” is often conceived of as especially 
bound up with the reactive realm is shown in the fact that the word 
feeling is so commonly employed as the equivalent of the word 
emotion, 
B 
Sec. 19, In closing it may be well to say a few words concerning 
the relation of the empirical ego to that very notable special “sense 
of relation” which gives us our appreciation of the spatial quality, 
and which leads us to speak of certain presentations as objects 
existing in an outer world: this spatial quality being in our view 
a special quality of relation determined by the coincidence of 
emphases which appear very persistently in our experience, the 
emphases which bring this relation most clearly into prominence 
being of a sensational-perceptual nature, or closely allied thereto. 
So far then as the empirical ego has a sensational emphasis we 
might expect to find it at times spatially qualified: and such is
-P-A-G-E-536
522 THE SELF 
clearly our experience so far as we identify the empirical ego with 
our bodily sensations. ‘This spatially qualified empirical ego is of 
course a crude thing : for when we attempt to analyze the “ bodily 
feel” with which we identiff it the sensational attributes at once 
begin to scale off as we have seen, and at once appear as presentations 
diverse from the empirical ego. Nevertheless the normal man, who 
does not stoop to careful introspection, looks upon himself as big or 
little as he happens to think of himself as important or unimportant 
in the total world of his thought concerning objects in the outer 
world.t 
But as I have indicated above our general tendency to make too 
much of the sensationally qualified emphases in attention leads us 
to make too much of the sensational type of empirical egohood, 
and to overlook the non-sensational-perceptual types to which the 
spatial characteristic cannot be expected to apply noticeably. And 
it thus happens that careful introspection shows us these object-in- 
the-outer-world characteristics of the ordinary empirical ego splitting 
off from it and appearing as objects contrasted with it. The more 
carefully we observe the nature of this empirical ego the more vague 
and elusive and non-sensational it appears, and then as we have seen 
we are led to hold that the body is not the real essence of the 
empirical ego, which latter is a core quite apart from the world 
of objects to which alone spatial attributes attach, and part of which 
the man’s body is. 
As we have seen the spatial quality is in some way bound up with, 
or as some would say derived from, the recognition that other selves 
than ours join in a common experience. It is interesting then in 
this connection, where we are considering the non-spatiality of 
certain types of the empirical ego, to note that as soon as we realize 
that a special experience belongs to our own empirical egos only, 
its externality is at once in large measure lost. The rainbow is 
thought of by, me as an object in the air: ie. it has marked spatial 
qualifications, until I am assured that each of us has his own special 
1 This is brought out quite clearly in connection with certain morbid 
states which are experienced by many at times of bodily disturbance, and 
at times when we dream. Normal men not infrequently dream of being 
giants of form and strength, or of shrinking to minute proportions : and 
insane and hysterical patients often find themselves oppressed by illusions of 
the same general nature.

rainbow, when at once my rainbow is thought of as in my own 
subjective experience rather than in space. With this assurance that 
the rainbow is mine only the spatial quality in connection with it 
loses all its emphasis,! for the reason that the empirical ego is 
recognized to be in the main non-spatial. 
Sec. 20. We have just seen that as the empirical ego becomes less 
explicit its nature tends to be less identified with the sensational- 
perceptual realms in connection with which the spatial quality is 
markedly developed; hence if “feeling” is as we suggest the 
empirical ego not yet become explicit we should not be led to look 
for any emphasis of spatiality in connection with “feeling.” It 
seems fairly clear that it would generally be held that “ feeling” is 
non-spatial ; that we find little in it that suggests the outer-world 
aspect of experience, although we at times note the characteristic 
which leads us to attach it closely to the body. 
1] would not imply that all spatial characteristics are thus lost; for the 
rainbow even as thus correctly conceived seems to me to display still those 
spatial characteristics which develop in the conceptual realm.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 
Sec. 1. Wer may turn now to the consideration of the 
nature of that Self in relation with which are contrasted those 
emphases in consciousness which make up the field of atten- 
tion; the Self which is thought of as receptive of these 
emphases when we speak of them as presentations, and as 
reactive in relation to them. 
The average man as we have seen finds no problem here, 
for assuming that this Self is the ego of his self-conscious 
states he is not brought face to face with difficulties which we 
meet who have been led to see that this every day self is an 
empirical ego ; that it is merely a special form of those pre- 
sentations which make up the field of attention; that it is 
itself given asa partial presentation to the Self in the moments 
of self-conscious reflection in which this elusive Self escapes 
our analysis ; that its very existence as a presentation involves 
the existence of a Self which is not the empirical ego, to which 
Self the empirical ego is presented. The most that any one 
can possibly claim in this connection in reference to this em- 
pirical ego of self-consciousness is that, if it is not the Self, at 
least introspection seems to tell us that it is inherently involved 
with the Self, and that it appears to partake of the nature of 
this Self ; but such a claim must finally rest upon an inference, 
and cannot be assumed to be valid without careful study quite 
apart from the experience of the empirical ego as given in 
reflection.
-P-A-G-E-539
  
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 525 
If it be claimed that this Self that I thus speak of is after 
all nothing more than a mere concept, that it is really built 
up as it were out of material given in our retrospective 
consideration of the revivals of past experiences of the em- 
pirical ego, it suffices to reply that in the fact that such a 
conceptual self is held to be a concept it is acknowledged to be 
what we call a presentation, and that it therefore cannot be the 
Self the nature of which we are considering, cannot be the 
entity that is involved with the experience given when we 
appreciate the Self as receptive of the presentations within 
consciousness, and as reactive in relation to them. Surely 
this very conceptual self, being itself a given presentation, 
cannot be the Self to which it is presented. 
And the same may be said of those conceptions of the true 
Self which make allowance for the fact that the every day self 
is of an empirical nature, and endeavor to get back of it in 
some way to a self of a higher nature: which build up for 
instance a genetic concept based upon the nature of the experi- 
enced empirical ego, as it is related to our recognition in 
attention of other egos, and in connection with our know- 
ledge of the processes of development in nature. For here 
too we perceive that such conceptual selves are not the entities 
that are receptive of the presentations within consciousness, 
and reactive in relation to them: again we note that what we 
speak of thus as the self, being itself a concept, is a presenta- 
tion referring to a Self which is not, and which never can be, 
a presentation or emphasis within the field of attention in 
consciousness, and can never be studied directly in reflection. 
Sec. 2. Failing to grasp the nature of the Self by reference 
to our experience of the empirical ego in moments of self- 
consciousness, or by reference to the broader conception of a 
true self above referred to, we are not unnaturally tempted to 
leap to the conclusion that this true Self, which we conceive 
of as a somewhat to which presentations in consciousness are 
given, is entirely outside of and beyond consciousness: a 
 
-P-A-G-E-540
526 THE SELF 
view which would not demand special remark were it not 
really implied in much of the discussion of this subject. We 
may perchance choose to call it a ‘‘soul substance” ; but give 
it what name we will we are tempted to consider it as some- 
thing of a nature quite diverse from consciousness as experi- 
enced ; as a sort of spiritual eye which watches the incoming 
and outgoing stream of consciousness, much as we watch with 
our physical eyes the movements of the living beings around 
us ; or as an entity which is bombarded as it were by presenta- 
tions ; or as a cold mass of intellectuality to which experience 
appeals but which is unaffected by, although at times it may 
affect, this experience. 
But when we seriously reflect upon such notions we find 
that they are no more satisfactory than the crude conception 
which identifies the Self with the empirical ego. For we 
discover that we are speaking of what has in fact no meaning, 
—are really talking pure nonsense,—when we speak of the 
Self as utterly, or even very markedly, diverse from conscious 
experience, and yet as having some sort of extraordinarily 
intimate relation with it. How can it be thus related with 
consciousness if there is no common bond between it and 
consciousness? How can we speak of a presentation to the 
Self without implying the existence of a reciprocal relation 
between the two; and without implying the existence of a 
bond of likeness between the Self and that conscious experi- 
ence which we call the presentation? 
So far as I can see if one is to maintain the view that the 
Self is not part of our consciousness he can do so only because 
he follows the average man in his common assumption that in 
reflection we have all there is of consciousness, making this 
assumption merely because clear knowledge is given only in 
vivid states of reflection. But, as we have seen in earlier 
chapters, this assumption is entirely unwarranted ; and in this 
particular practically all psychologists to day are in agreement. 
It is true as we have seen that only in states of reflection are
-P-A-G-E-541
  
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 527 
we able to recall any of the consciousness of the past, and the 
average man therefore carelessly comes to think that only 
what can be revived by him was in the consciousness of his 
past ; he then takes a step further and identifies consciousness 
with what can appear as the revival of past conscious states ; 
and without just ground he is led thus to give to conscious- 
ness the limitations which belong to revival, or even to that 
special form of revival which we designate as memory. 
Consciousness is thus identified with the field of attention, 
and as the Self is not of the field of attention it must under 
such a view be difficult to hold that it is part of consciousness. 
But under our view consciousness in any moment is much 
broader than the mere presentations we experience, which are 
mere emphases within the whole noetic system ; which latter 
is in each moment inclusive of the Self to which the presenta- 
tion accrues. 
If we are led to identify the Self with what we may call a 
monad, or a hypothetically simple entity, we find we have 
gained nothing. As Mr. F. H. Bradley’ says ‘‘If we make 
this unit something moving parallel with the life of a man, or, 
rather, something not moving but literally standing in rela- 
tion to his successive variety, this will not give us much help. 
It will be the man’s Self about as much as it is his star (if he 
has one) which looks down from above and cares not when he 
perishes. And if the unit is brought down into the life of 
the person, and so in any sense suffers his fortunes, then in 
what sense does it remain any longer an unit? And if we 
will but look at the question, we are forced to this conclusion. 
If we knew already what we meant by the Self, and could 
point out its existence, then our monad might be offered as a 
theory to account for that Self... . But so long as we 
have no clear view as to the limits in actual fact of the Self?s 
existence, our monad leaves us with all our old confusion and 
obscurity. But it further loads us with the problem of its 
1Cf. Appearance and Reality, p. 86 and confer ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-542
ae 
528 THE SELF 
connection with these facts about which we are so ignorant. 
If the monad owns the whole diversity, or any selected part 
of the diversity which we find in the individual, then, even 
if you had found in this the identity of the Self, you would 
have to reconcile it all with the simplicity of the monad. But 
if the monad stands aloof, either with no character at all, or a 
private character apart, then it may be a fine thing in itself, but 
it is a mere mockery to call it the ‘Self of the man.” 
In any event, whatever may be the metaphysical import or 
value of this or similar concepts, it is sufficiently clear that 
they do not relate to the Self of the moment’s experience with 
which we are here dealing ; and we are therefore not called 
upon in this work to enter into a discussion of the merits of 
the theories they involve. 
Sec. 3. When we ask ourselves whether it is possible to 
conceive of the Self as part of the consciousness of each 
moment we at once see that such a view is sustained by the 
very fact that our experience appears in reflection as a stream 
flowing toward and away, as a series of presentations, as what 
Dr. James Ward calls a “‘ presentation continuum.” For the 
Self is also conceived of as a continuing entity and these 
notions of presentations, of a stream, seem to imply that the 
Self to which the presentations are given, to which and from 
which the stream flows, is of the same fundamental nature as 
that conscious experience which we describe as the ‘‘ presenta- 
tion continuum,” or the flowing stream of consciousness; as 
must be the case if both the Self and the presentations to the 
Self in each moment are diverse parts of the moment’s con- 
sciousness taken as a whole. 
We find a further corroboration of this view if, in relation 
to the presentations which appear in the field of attention, we 
consider the nature of our Selves as indicated by objective 
signs. For although we find it impossible to study the Self 
introspectively in reflection, nevertheless, as we shall see more 
in detail in later chapters, we are able to judge of its nature
-P-A-G-E-543
  
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 529 
by an objective study of its reaction upon the presentations 
which are given to it; as is clear in the fact that we do thus 
study the Selves of our fellow men who surround us, and do 
thereupon, with practical advantage, judge of their characters, 
i.e. of the nature of their Selves. 
If then we consider our Selves objectively, as we would 
think of the Selves of our friends, and make note also of our 
“presentation continua” in relation therewith, we find that 
with the increase of intensity of presentations, and of grade 
of attention, our Selves as objectively viewed appear concen- 
trated as it were to meet the demands of reaction in certain 
limited directions: if this vividness of intensity and attention 
be increased sufficiently we become more or less idiosyncratic, 
no longer bearing close relation with the social world. But on 
the other hand if this vividness of intensity and attention be 
reduced, objective evidence shows us that our Selves become 
entities of a wider, fuller nature: indeed if this vividness be 
reduced sufficiently by the removal of sources of stimulation 
there appears in consciousness a coordinate loss of definite- 
“ness, the field of attention spreads itself out and appears to 
dissolve away into a something wider, until finally we reach a 
state of the broadest of conscious experience in which there 
seems to be naught but mere consciousness. Objectively 
viewed the Self is still there; but subjectively, presentation 
and Self seem to have become one and the same. 
It thus appears that the Self and the presentations thereto 
are inextricably intertwined if we may so speak. Mr. F. H. 
Bradley ' has studied this particular fact with his usual acute- 
ness of introspection. ‘“‘Let us . . . ask” he says, “‘if the 
not-Self contains anything which belongs to it exclusively. 
It will not be easy to discover many such elements. In the 
theoretical relations it is quite clear that not everything can be 
an object, all together and at once. At any one moment that 
which is in any sense before me must be limited. What are

-P-A-G-E-544
  530 THE SELF 
we to say then becomes of that remainder of the not-Self 
which clearly has not, even for the time, passed wholly from 
my mind? Ido not mean those features of the environment 
to which I fail to attend specially, but which I still go on 
perceiving as something before me. I refer to the features 
which have not sunk below this level. These are not even 
a setting or a fringe to the object of my mind. They have 
passed lower into the general background of feeling, from 
which that distinct object with its indistinct setting is de- 
tached. But this means that for the time they have passed 
into the Self. A constant sound will afford us a very good 
instance. That may be made into the principal object of my 
mind, or it may be an accompaniment of that object more or 
less definite. But there is a further stage, where you cannot 
say that the sensation has ceased, and when yet it is no feature 
in what comes as the not-Self. It has become now one among 
the many elements of my feeling and it has passed into that 
Self for which the not-Self exists.” 
In the last sentence of this quotation Mr. Bradley records 
an introspective observation the importance of which is not 
commonly noted; viz. that our experience warrants us in 
saying that our presentations fade off into the Self. But 
what he is thus picturing as the realm into which the presenta- 
tions fade is really what I have elsewhere described as the field 
of inattention. What we usually think of as attention is 
more or less vivid, more or less wide, and it has its setting in 
a still broader field to which we seldom apply the word atten- 
tion, but which is nevertheless of the nature of the more vivid 
field of presentations ; and this broader ill-defined field seems 
to fade into a still broader field of what is still consciousness. 
But if on the one hand it is consciousness, on the other hand 
it certainly cannot be said to be of the field of attention, it is 
part at least of an undifferentiated psychic mass which lies 
beyond this field of attention : viz. the field of inattention. 
All presentations to the Self are of the field of attention.
-P-A-G-E-545
  
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 531 
The Self of the moment when a presentation is given however 
is never of the field of attention. But if the Self is part of 
consciousness it must then be at least within the field of 
inattention; and as there is no evidence that this field of 
inattention is broader than the Self, and none that the Self 
contains other elements than those which exist in this field of 
inattention, there seems no ground of objection to the 
assumption that the field of inattention and the Self are one 
and the same, and identical: the Self thus appearing as a 
part of consciousness, as a whole undifferentiated mass against 
which by contrast appear such parts of consciousness as are 
emphasized in attention. 
Sec. 4. Those who have followed our study of the nature 
of the empirical ego will perceive, as noted again 1n Sec. 6 
below, that it and the Self thus appear to be fundamentally of 
the same nature: and if this is true, and if the Self of each 
moment is the field of inattention, then we should expect to 
note the fading of the empirical ego into this field of inatten- 
tion so far as it is still sufficiently marked to be in the least 
given presentatively. It is the recognition of the continuity 
of the empirical ego with the field of inattention which leads 
Mr. Bradley 1 to venture so positive a statement as that ‘‘ there 
seems, however, no doubt that the inner core of feeling, 
resting mainly on what is called coenesthesia, is the foundation 
of the Self? In our view however the Self, while of the 
nature of this coenesthesia, is not such as can appear even as 
the most vague of presentations, not even as a mere back- 
ground of “‘feeling” against which the non-ego appears. As 
Lotze says? “‘Selfhood, the essence of personality, does not 
depend upon any opposition that either has happened, or is 
happening, of the ego to a non-ego; but it consists in an 
immediate self-existence which constitutes the basis of the 
possibility of that contrast wherever it appears. Self-con- 
1 Appearance and Reality, p. 80 (italics mine).

-P-A-G-E-546
    532 THE SELF 
sciousness is the elucidation of this self-existence which is 
brought about by means of knowledge, and even this is by 
no means necessarily bound up with the distinction of the ego 
from a non-ego which is substantially opposed to it.” 
Sec. 5. The view as to the nature of the Self here main- 
tained appears to me to be not very far removed from, and to 
be readily related with, that expressed by Prof. James* where 
he speaks of the passing thought as being the thinker. 
“Each pulse of cognitive consciousness, each thought,” says 
he “‘dies away and is replaced by another. The other. . . 
knows its own predecessor, and finding it ‘warm,’ in the way 
we have described, greets it, saying ‘Thou are mine and part 
of the same Self with me.’ Each later thought knowing and 
including thus the thought which went before, is the final 
receptacle,—and appropriating them is the final owner,—of 
all that they contain or own.”’? 
In my view this statement does not go far enough: it de- 
mands further development. The passing Thought in my view 
does not in itself and alone become the Thinker. Not because 
of its own specific nature does it become the Thinker, but in 
the fact of passing it becomes part and parcel of the vast 
field of inattention, which constitutes the Self, to which it 
adds its minute portion. The passing Thought, plus the 
vast array of psychic effects of past experience with which it 
connects itself, is what makes up the Self which is the 
Thinker ;—this, and no less than this. 
Sec. 6. Looking at the matter from another point of view 
we note that the very misconceptions of which we have spoken 
in Sec. 2 point to this same view as to the nature of this 
Self. 
The fact that the Self is usually identified with the 
empirical ego of self-consciousness would seem to imply 
that it is of the same nature as the empirical ego, that per- 
haps the more definite empirical ego arises out of the Self, 
1 Psychology, vol. i. p. 342. 2 Ibid. p. 339.
-P-A-G-E-547
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 533 
that perhaps in a sense it is continuous with the Self. And 
this in fact is a fair statement of our theory as explained 
in Chapter m., and in Chapters xxi. and xxt1. above, accord- 
ing to which the empirical ego is a mass of undifferentiable 
psychic elements sufficiently integrated to appear as a mass as 
a presentation to the Self, while within and in contrast with 
this mass appears the psychic emphasis which we speak of as 
the object. The empirical ego being of such a nature it 
evidently must be a simulacrum of the Self. If it is such a 
simulacrum to the Self then it would follow that when it 
disappears as a presentation it must be absorbed into the Self 
of the moment. 
If this is accepted as a proper view as to the relation of 
the empirical ego to the Self then we might expect to note 
that a special psychic emphasis which at one moment is given 
as a presentation to the Self might without essential altera- 
tions appear in another moment as part of the complex pre- 
sentation of self-consciousness as an object in relation to the 
empirical ego, and this is evidently the case, as we have noted 
in the chapters above mentioned. 
Again, the very fact that the Self is often thought of as 
outside of consciousness, in connection with the recognition 
1 One special fact may be well worth noting in this connection. When 
a “suggestion” to do some given thing in the future is made to a patient 
in the hypnotic trance, he often shows by his words that he is self-conscious 
in the trance state ;—that he has in mind under the abnormal conditions 
an empirical ego which he thinks of as presently to perform a certain act, in 
accordance with the suggestion given to him. 
When, being awakened from the trance, he performs this suggested act 
he in most cases merely does so without being in any measure self-conscious. 
He cannot remember that the act was suggested, he will say that he does 
not know why he performed it; all that he can tell of it is that, the 
appropriate signal having been given, he (that is his Self as viewed objec- 
tively) acted as he did; the suggestion originally given in the field of 
attention of the hypnotic state, and acquiesced in then as a future act of the 
empirical ego, appears in his normal life as arising from within the field of 
inattention, as coming from the man’s very innermost Self. 
   
-P-A-G-E-548
  534 THE SELF 
of the similarity of the Self and the empirical ego, would 
seem to imply that the relation between presentations and 
the Self is appreciated as being of the same nature as the 
relation of the object and the empirical ego. For if in states of 
self-consciousness the object is thought of by the average man 
as entirely exclusive of the empirical ego, so the non-present- 
able Self would naturally be thought of as exclusive of that 
emphatic part of consciousness which the common man and 
psychologist alike all too readily assume to be the whole of 
the consciousness of any special moment. 
Sec. 7. In connection with the movement of attention we 
find further support for this view. For when weare thoroughly 
self-conscious we note in the field of attention an empirical 
ego, and a series of objects related to this empirical ego. And 
when we are entirely lacking in self-consciousness we note in 
the field of attention merely a series of what we call presenta- 
tions which are of the same nature as the objects in states of 
self-consciousness. The significant fact here to be noted is 
that the movement of attention as observed in the series of 
objects related to the empirical ego (and exclusive of this 
empirical ego) is appreciated as of the same nature as the 
movement of attention as observed in the series of presenta- 
tions where no empirical ego is part of the field of attention : 
this being evidenced in the fact that in our consideration of 
the contents of, and of the movements of, attention we pass 
from the self-conscious to the non-self-conscious fields with- 
out the least hesitation, as though they were one and the same 
in kind and nature; as indeed under our hypothesis they 
must be. 
But this is especially significant in connection with the 
fact that the object in states of self-consciousness is recognized 
to be necessarily affected by the nature of the empirical ego, 
that it is what it is because of the existence also in attention of 
the empirical ego, the empirical ego and its object being both 
partial presentations and both of the same general nature and
-P-A-G-E-549
THE NATURE OF THE SELF 535 
reciprocally reactive. If then the presentation to the Self 
when we are not self-conscious is of the same nature as the 
self-conscious object contrasted with the empirical ego, surely 
it would appear that the presentation to the Self can only be 
what it is because it is acted upon, and itself reacts upon, a 
somewhat which is in general of the same fundamental nature 
with itself, and which corresponds in its general nature with 
that of the empirical ego. 
It would seem then to follow (1st) that the Self must be of 
the same general nature as the presentation to the Self, as 
the empirical ego is of the same general nature as its object ; 
and (2nd) that the relation existing between the Self and its 
presentation must be fundamentally the same as that existing 
in our self-conscious states between the empirical ego and its 
object. For were there no Self to which the presentation is 
given, and were this Self not of the same fundamental nature 
as the empirical ego, then surely the presentation of non- 
conscious states would not appear to be of the same nature as 
the object related to and affected by the empirical ego in 
self-conscious states. 
Sec. 8. Assuming then that the Self of each moment is 
the field of inattention of that moment, and that it is funda- 
mentally of the same general nature as the field of attention ; 
and that the empirical ego within this field of attention is a 
simulacrum of this Self, we must seek to determine what the 
nature of the Self must be by reference to what the nature of 
the empirical ego, as studied in reflection, actually is. 
In general we may say, as we have seen, that the empirical 
ego is the psychic coincident of an emphasized vast mass of 
neural activities which are so fully coordinated that the ele- 
mental activities do not distinctly separate themselves away 
from the general pulse of activities of the mass. Still more 
thoroughly coordinated then must be the neural activities 
which are the coincidents of that vast field of inattention, 
—the Self. This thorough coordination of the countless
-P-A-G-E-550
  536 THE SELF 
elements of this vast neural mass can only be accounted for as 
the result through inheritance of the experience of the ages 
through which the man and all his ancestors have passed. 
This experience has led to the coordination of which we 
speak in directions which have in the past served the purposes 
of Nature in the development of all the man’s progenitors. 
The Self is thus fundamentally of the nature of the “instinct 
experiences”: it speaks of the experience of all the vast 
array of ancestors from whom the man is descended, and its 
voice, as indicated in what we call the man’s character, should 
be looked upon as telling of and in favor of this experience of 
countless ages. The Self thus appears as the conservative 
part of consciousness.

THE RELATION. BETWEEN THE EMPIRICAL EGO AND 
ITS OBJECTS AS COMPARED WITH THE RELATION 
BETWEEN THE SELF AND ITS PRESENTATIONS 
I 
Sec. 1. WueEn we consider the nature of the nervous 
system, and our usual assumption that all the activities within 
it are fundamentally of the same nature, we perceive in the 
first place that where a complex neururgic emphasis occurs, 
the minor neururgic emphases within this complex must dis- 
play a reciprocal efficiency: and in the second place that an 
emphasis of activity in any part must affect the activities of 
the system in general ; and that the nature of the activities of 
the system as a whole must affect the nature of the emphatic 
activity. If then a thoroughgoing neururgic and noetic 
correspondence exists we should expect to note in the first 
place that when a complex noetic emphasis or presentation 
occurs the minor emphases or minor presentations within the 
complex presentation must display a reciprocal efficiency : and 
in the second place that each noetic emphasis must affect the 
nature of the noetic system in general; and that the nature 
of the noetic system as a whole must affect the nature of the 
noetic emphasis. 
Sec. 2. "Taking into consideration in the first place the re- 
ciprocal efficiency between minor presentations within a pre- 
sentational complex, we note that the presentations which 
 
-P-A-G-E-552
  538 THE SELF 
from moment to moment appear marked in attention, are 
dependent for their emphasis upon the nature of the discern- 
ible whole noetic pattern to which they belong: the ‘ object 
of attention” is not isolated, but is part of a minor psychic 
system of more or less complexity the existence of which is 
more or less clearly appreciated. And on the other hand this 
noetic pattern shifts and changes as the psychic elements which 
appear as presentations themselves shift and change. 
If, refreshed after the night’s rest, I enter my study at my 
morning work hour, the papers and books on my writing table, 
and the comfortable divan, are both looked at, and both make 
distinct observable impressions ; and the same thing happens 
when I enter my study at the close of a day of arduous work. 
But in the first case when I am fresh the impression of the 
papers and books, and in the second case when I am weary 
that of the divan etc., becomes important in relation to all 
else in the field of attention: in other words the nature of the 
whole complex noetic emphasis, different in each of the two 
cases, evidently acts upon the special presentations referred to, 
increasing or thwarting their development as the case may be. 
On the other hand the presentations determined by the im- 
pressions of the books and of the divan respectively act upon 
the whole of the presentative field to alter the form of all 
the emphases within the noetic pattern, as is clear in the 
fact that they lead to totally different reactions in the two 
cases. 
We have above considered complex presentations of an 
impressional type ; but it is clear that the elements of thought 
complexes react reciprocally also. If the whole presentation 
in attention consists of some special thought complex, say the 
“theory of organic development” ; and if some fact in nature 
becomes noticeably correlated with the thought complex ; 
then that aspect of this fact in nature which relates to the 
theory of development becomes emphatic, and reciprocally 
the “theory of development” is emphasized just so far as it
-P-A-G-E-553
  
RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF = 539 
seems to be corroborated or weakened by this fact in nature. 
The noetic emphases which appear from time to time in our 
life of thought are dependent upon the existence, within con- 
sciousness as a whole, of recognizable apperceptive systems, to 
take Stout’s term ; and these apperceptive systems are them- 
selves modified by the influence of the marked noetic emphases 
which they assimilate. 
The case is similar where complex impulsive states occupy 
the field of attention. If the benevolent impulse fills atten- 
tion when some evidently worthless tipsy tramp asks me for 
money, my benevolent impulse on the one hand tends to 
make me overlook the evil I may do him in giving him money 
to be used in obtaining drink, and to exaggerate beyond 
measure the relief of his misery which my money may bring 
to him, this resulting in the emphasis of the tendency to give. 
But on the other hand the emphasis of the tendency to give 
modifies sensibly the whole nature of my complex benevolent 
impulse of the moment, making me distinctly ‘‘ soft-hearted” 
as the thought of giving is emphasized. 
Sec. 3. We note thus that a reciprocal efficiency is ob- 
served between the diverse partial presentations within a 
presentative complex. If then we have in the state of self- 
consciousness a complex presentation of double emphasis in 
which both the empirical ego and its object are clear partial 
presentations, then in states of self-consciousness we should 
be able to note the existence of a reciprocal efficiency between 
the empirical ego and its object. 
Again if it is true that the empirical ego is a simulacrum 
of the Self, and that the relation of the empirical ego to its 
objects is of a like nature with the relation of the Self to its 
presentations, then we might be led to hope to find evidence 
of a reciprocal efficiency existing between the Self and its 
presentations. 
In our study of the reciprocal efficiency of the empirical 
ego and its objects we may hope for fairly clear data, for both
-P-A-G-E-554
  540 THE SELF 
are partial presentations. Even here however we must be 
prepared to meet with introspective difficulties for the reason 
that of the two partial presentations under consideration the 
object is alone analysable with any degree of clearness, while 
the empirical ego must always appear as a relatively indistinct 
undifferentiable mass. 
But when we turn to the study of the reciprocal efficiency 
of the Self and its presentations we face much more formidable 
difficulties. For as we have so often said the Self cannot be 
directly studied in reflection, and the reader who follows me 
in upholding the thesis here maintained must not hope to find 
evidence of a crucial character ; he must be content with mere 
corroboration which can only appear effective as it is cumula- 
tive, and must feel satisfied if in the end of our examination 
he discovers no contradictions in introspective experience. 
The action of the Self upon the presentations, and the 
modifications of the noetic forms resulting therefrom, we may 
hope to observe in some measure introspectively inasmuch 
as the presentations as thus modified are given in reflection. 
Nevertheless even here we must face the fact that, as we cannot 
observe the Self in reflection and therefore cannot note any 
definite sense of its activity if such occur, we can offer no 
positive proof that it is the Self which produces the observed 
modifications in the presentations under consideration: we 
must content ourselves with such indirect evidence as is found 
if we observe that the presentations are in a general way 
modified as we should expect them to be modified if the Self 
is of the nature suggested by our hypothesis. 
Evidence of the action of presentations upon the Self and 
of the modifications of the Self resulting therefrom, if such 
modifications occur, can only be gained even more indirectly. 
For so long as these modifications are of such slight moment 
that they do not involve any indirectly resultant presentation 
to the Self they cannot be observed introspectively at all ; 
and when such modifications are observable they are no longer
-P-A-G-E-555
RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 541 
of the Self, but appear as themselves modifications of the 
field of attention of the moment. 
We are greatly aided however by the observation that in 
every day life we do not hesitate to judge of the nature of 
other men’s Selves in judging of their characters. And when 
we consider this habit of ours we note that we judge of the 
nature of other men’s Selves by observation of the reaction 
of these Selves upon those presentations which we judge from 
our own experience must be in the individuals’ fields of atten- 
tion. And in truth we may and do thus in retrospect study 
objectively the nature of our own characters or Selves. 
This judgment as to the nature of our neighbour’s character 
turns upon the fact that we interpret his expressions which 
we are able to observe. Some of these expressions have to 
do with what we know to be presentations within his con- 
sciousness ; but a very large proportion of them have to do 
with what are very slightly emphatic parts of his conscious- 
ness, and a still larger proportion with what are generally 
spoken of as “‘ unconscious reflexes.” + Evidently the ‘‘ char- 
acter” which we thus judge is as broad as the whole of the 
man’s consciousness, and therefore its psychic correspondent 
is inclusive of that part of consciousness which we call his 
Self ; and it is clear that when we speak of a man’s character, 
while we refer to some extent perhaps to the emphases within 
the man’s field of attention, we refer very much more to the 
nature of his Self: that is, we assume that a man’s character 
on its psychic side includes as its most important constituent 
the man’s Self. That we are justified in this manner of 
thought would not be disputed by the mass of men, and least 
of all by those who would agree with the positions thus far 
taken in this work, which present ample justification for 
1Jt is very significant in relation to our general view that in judging of 
his fellow’s character by the interpretation of his expressions, the common 
man does not draw any line of exclusion of the activities which he usually 
speaks of as unconscious.
-P-A-G-E-556
542 THE SELF 
upholding such a view: but to account for the common 
assumption that we have objective means of judging of the 
nature of other men’s Selves would be no easy task for one 
who does not agree that a man’s character as objectively 
viewed is the whole of his consciousness, and that this con- 
sciousness is much broader than the mere emphases in his 
field of attention, and that the vastly broader part is his field 
of inattention, i.e. his Self. 
We may turn then to a study of the reciprocal efficiency of 
the empirical ego and its objects as observable in reflection ; 
and may compare it with the action of the Self upon its pre- 
sentations as these latter are observable in reflection, and with 
the action of presentations upon the nature of the Self as this 
is judged objectively. 
II. Tue Recrprocat Errictency or THE Empiricat Eco 
AND ITs OBJECTS, AND OF THE SELF AND ITS PRESEN- 
TATIONS 
A. The Efficiency of Objects in Relation to the Empirical Ego 
Sec. 4. Our thesis implies in the first place that the very 
existence of an object in relation to the empirical ego in a 
well defined state of self-consciousness must result in a modi- 
fication of the nature of the empirical ego, and the reader 
will surely agree that there is no lack of evidence of such 
changes of empirical egohood under such conditions. 
As I am now writing the most marked emphases within 
my consciousness are of a visual sensational type. One who 
watches me would say that the changes of light on my table 
affect me, but that the varying sounds in the street do not 
affect me to any noticeable degree: so far as I am self-con- 
scious my empirical ego appears as that of the quiet writer. 
But suddenly I start up and go to the window with the remark 
did you hear that ‘‘clap of thunder.” The loud noise has 
 
-P-A-G-E-557
  RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 543 
changed my empirical ego as I describe it. I am now very 
susceptible to sound impressions and careless of light impres- 
sions. With the full self-consciousness of a very active 
personality I am listening to the sounds in the street, and 
asking my friend whether I could have been mistaken and 
could have misinterpreted some other sound. 
It is equally clear that thought trains which are emphatic 
in attention as objects contrasted with the empirical ego react 
upon and modify the nature of the empirical ego. Let us 
suppose that I read a series of arguments in relation to the 
nature of light; and that having been taught in my college 
days that the undulatory theory of light is correct, I become 
convinced by the newer arguments that late discoveries tend 
to suggest the validity of some modified form of the older 
corpuscular theory. If perchance I find myself able to say 
at the moment that I believe in the validity of this modified 
corpuscular theory I can mean nothing more nor less than 
that the series of arguments have changed the very nature 
of my empirical ego. The empirical ego that to-day in 
believing holds the corpuscular theory to be real cannot be 
in any exact sense the same empirical ego that believed yester- 
day in the undulatory theory, even if it be contended that 
many unmodified elements remain common to both. And 
if this is true it seems clear that the objects related to the 
empirical ego have acted upon it to alter it while I have been 
concerned with the newer arguments. 
That impulses which are emphasized in attention as objects 
related to the empirical ego react upon and modify the 
empirical ego is equally clear. For many years, led at the 
start by strong benevolent impulses, I worked on investi- 
gating committees of a ‘‘ Charity Organization Society,” and 
in the end I found myself in self-conscious reflection really 
becoming a ‘‘hard-hearted” person. On the other hand my 
experience showed me that the man who spends his life as a 
professional almoner developes a change in his empirical ego,
-P-A-G-E-558
F e s e 
544 THE SELF 
becoming distinctly “‘soft-hearted” and often unable to re- 
strain himself from appeals of the unworthy if they are made 
with sufficient show of woe. 
a. The Efficiency of Presentations in Relation to the Self 
Sec. 5. In the preceding section we have illustrated the 
changes in the empirical ego produced by differences in the 
objects contrasted with it where one is fully self-conscious. 
But it seems very clear that very similar changes in the char- 
acter of the man—i.e. of the man’s Self, occur when he is 
utterly lacking in self-consciousness. As I watch my friend 
writing very rapidly, aiming to put into words the vivid 
thought which is interesting him, I know that he is altogether 
without self-consciousness, that his field of attention consists 
mainly of the partial presentations due to the visual forms 
of the page before him and to the muscular sensations due 
to writing, and especially of the partial presentation which 
we call the complex thought which demands interpretation. 
The crash of thunder may awaken him to self-conscious- 
ness as in our example in the previous section, but on the 
other hand it may not. We may see him quite ‘‘absent- 
mindedly” rise from the table, step to the open window and 
close it, and then come back to his writing table ; and when 
he acts thus we know that he, while without any self-con- 
sciousness, is vividly impressed no longer by visual but by 
aural impressions and their resultants in muscular reactions, 
as well as by the still persistent complex thought which 
demands interpretation. But in this moment his character- 
istics have been much altered, the whole neururgic and corre- 
sponding noetic patterns of the man must have changed ; 
and this means a change at the moment in the nature of the 
non-presentable Self, the change being clearly due to the 
alterations in the nature of the presentations which have been 
given in the field of attention. 
Or we may take an example where the change in the man’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-559
RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 545 
Self is less ephemeral. The news of a falling market with 
danger of business disturbances is likely to make the pre- 
viously cheerful banker a man of depressed and anxious spirit, 
unable to appreciate a good joke, silent at home, unable to 
force himself to enjoy his every day life in social relations: 
and this quite apart from any self-consciousness. A rising 
market and indications of the full success of enterprises in 
which he is interested will on the other hand make the man 
quite another creature, he will be gay and joyful, anxious to 
entertain his friends, and fond of the play of wit. His very 
Self is altered by the force of the diverse presentations given 
to him. 
If we place a man in circumstances where his thoughts 
are given persistently to special considerations we are able 
finally to observe even more permanent changes of his Self. 
The adulation of the multitude which comes to the successful 
artist, or to the clergyman, or to the political leader, is very 
wont to “‘turn his head” as we all know. He becomes 
content to be dogmatic, unreceptive of criticism or sugges- 
tion; he loses the modesty of his earlier nature, appears to 
us dictatorial, ‘‘hard to get along with,” and altogether 
becomes a changed character, a new and diverse Self. 
It is to be recalled here that the Self, under our view, is 
much more thoroughly coordinated, so to speak, than the 
empirical ego ; it is a vastly broader and more fully related 
noetic system than that which constitutes the latter. And 
for this reason we should expect to note that changes of 
empirical egohood are more easily made by the influence of 
its objects, than changes in the Self by its presentations: and 
this we discover to be the case. A man will listen to a cogent 
argument in opposition to the political views he has long 
held, and being aroused to self-consciousness the argument 
which is objective in relation to his empirical ego may change 
the latter; he may find himself saying “‘I see the force of 
your argument. J have-been wrong all these years.” But 
2M
-P-A-G-E-560
    546 THE SELF 
when the day of election comes we are likely to find him, 
with no self-consciousness, hastening to cast his vote with 
the political party with which his affiliations have always been 
close. His Self has not been altered materially by the forces 
which were potent to change the empirical ego of one of his 
self-conscious states. Long years, and persistent reiterations 
of special presentations, are required to alter permanently 
and fundamentally the nature of the Self, in connection with 
changes in the nature of the presentations that are given; 
although less important changes in it do occur from day to 
day, and from moment to moment. 
B. The Efficiency of the Empirical Ego in Relation 
to its Objects 
Sec. 6. That in fully developed states of self-conscious- 
ness the empirical ego appears as efficient in relation to its 
objects most men will without doubt acknowledge at once and 
without hesitation. We have here before us the important 
problem as to the nature of conation which we have touched 
upon already but which we must here consider with greater 
care. 
In the first place it is necessary to note again the fact that 
what at one time is the object related to the empirical ego 
of self-consciousness may be and often is the whole of the 
presentation to the non-presentable Self. A sensation for 
example which at one time is thought of as given to me, at 
another time may stand alone as a presentation when we are 
not in the least self-conscious. The empirical ego thus as 
it were comes out of the Self, and again is absorbed into it. 
The sense of the efficiency of the empirical ego thus fades 
off into a vague sense of efficiency attributable in later reflec- 
tion to the Self. But it seems certain that whenever we 
deal with clear states of self-consciousness we are dealing 
with an empirical ego, and not with the Self; and thus in
-P-A-G-E-561
  
RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 547 
all clear introspective appreciation of the action of an efficient 
“self? we refer to the empirical ego, and not to the true 
Self. 
Sec. 7. Conation broadly speaking refers to every exem- 
plification of the sense of the efficiency within the broad 
psychic system: and of the fullness of this conative aspect 
within consciousness we shall have ample evidence as we 
proceed. As we have already said, each psychic element has 
in it what we may describe as a ‘‘ movement beyond itself” ; 
and this it is that we call conation. At times this conation 
is not emphatic enough to be appreciated as such; but at 
other times it does become emphatic enough to be appreciated 
in such states as expectation, desire, impulse, resolve, con- 
sent ; leading up finally to the volitional act, or choice. 
It is not always however that this sense of conation is 
distinctly related to the empirical ego, and it may be experi- 
enced where we can scarcely be said to be explicitly self- 
conscious. These experiences we may pass over however, 
for we are here concerned to consider the fact that this sense 
of conative efficiency gains a special character when it is clearly 
bound up with the empirical ego of self-consciousness. 
It is to be noted especially that we do not refer just here 
to the act of will, or choice; that we shall consider in the 
next section. Psychological students all too often fall into 
error in that they fail to distinguish between conation in 
general, and the will act; they thus look upon the latter as 
typical of conation in general, and are wont to treat of what 
they call will as if it were a special ‘‘ faculty” of the human 
mind, speaking of it almost as though it were an entity apart 
from consciousness, and which acts from without upon con- 
sciousness. What we are considering just here is self- 
1Mr. F. H. Bradley (Mind, 44 N.S. p. 438) says that there is no will 
except in volition. He would thus appear to use “will” as identical with 
“the will act.” In common language the word will is frequently used 
as the equivalent of what I here call conation.
-P-A-G-E-562
  548 THE SELF 
conscious conative action in general. This becomes especially 
significant in all conscious states in which an efficiency in 
relation to the object is recognizedly bound up with the 
empirical ego. It is then appreciated as an efficiency which 
changes the object by the very process of the assimilation 
and enforcement of compatibles, and the rejection and weaken- 
ing of incompatibles. 
Attention as we have seen is always selective. But when- 
ever this selection is appreciated in our self-conscious states 
the presented empirical ego always appears as the efficient 
agent in the selective act. The nature of the empirical ego 
of the moment determines the selective emphasis of sounds 
at one time, of visual sensations at others, etc., all of which 
are interpreted in relation to the needs of the moment. All 
will agree that the same selective emphasis by the empirical 
ego is noted in the realm of instinct-experience and impulse ; 
and that it is distinguished also in the realm of thought is 
clear upon reflection, for as Prof. Royce! well says: ‘‘ the 
essence of reasoning, as of the whole thinking process, is that 
I am not merely concerned with the way in which images float 
before me, but with my consciousness of what 1 am doing 
with these images or with the objects that the images suggest.” 
This leads us to note one point already referred to which 
is perhaps not self-evident ; viz. that the J do and I think 
processes are fundamentally of the same nature.? If they 
1 Outlines of Psycholgy, p. 294. In the immediate context Prof. Royce 
places mere assimilation in opposition to this action of the empirical ego. 
But in my view this action of the empirical ego is a special instance of 
assimilation. 
2It appears to me fallacious to draw the sharp distinctions which Stout 
does between voluntary and impulsive action, and between deliberation and 
impulsive tendencies (Confer his Manual of Psychohgy, p. 583. Compare 
PP. 590-591, which appears in a measure to contradict his previous state- 
ment). The difference seems to me to be one of degree only. Conative 
efficiency (what most people call “ will”) is in all cases apparent. The 
difference is one of emphasis of this efficiency in connection with what we 
may call the violence of the will act to be considered later. 
 
-P-A-G-E-563
  RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 549 
seem dissimilar it is merely because the objects upon which 
the empirical ego acts themselves differ in their nature, in 
the one case being ideational, and in the other being im- 
pulsive ; the process in each case remaining the same. The 
I do process is more common than the I think process in the 
experience of the ordinary man who does not stop to weigh 
motives or to relate thoughts; and in fact this is true even 
in the average experience of the contemplative man. But 
the contemplative man often finds that the action of his 
empirical ego upon the field of impulse is of less import than 
its action upon the field of thought: the empirical ego in 
his case often emphasizes some thought element, which is 
forthwith expressed in action by what many would describe 
as a purely mechanical process, without the appearance of 
any impulse in attention. If the action of such a man is 
arrested however the impulse process appears in attention as 
it does for the man of uncontemplative habit, and as it does 
for himself in his uncontemplative moods. In fact the J do 
and the I think processes are both reducible to the emphasis 
by the empirical ego of some special objectified presentation, 
which being enforced works itself out at times in an expression 
of conviction, and at other times in an expression of bodily 
activity. : 
Sec. 8. We need not dwell longer however upon this 
particular aspect of the relation of conation to the empirical 
ego, but may turn to the consideration of an important special 
development of this conative tendency, which appears to us 
thus important because it is very much emphasized, and is 
always bound up very clearly in attention with the experienced 
efficiency of the empirical ego; I refer to what we call the 
will act, or voluntary choice. 
We are all too apt to think of this choice as the act of an 
individual entity ‘the will,” which is spoken of almost as 
though it were independent of consciousness. . It may be 
well then to remind ourselves that, as Locke taught us, ‘‘the
-P-A-G-E-564
550 THE SELF 
Will, in truth, signifies nothing but a power or ability to 
prefer or choose.” ‘‘If it be reasonable to suppose and talk 
of faculties as distinct beings that can act (as we do when we 
say the will orders . . .) it is fit that we should make a speak- 
ing faculty, and a walking faculty, and a dancing faculty by 
which these actions are produced, which are but several modes 
of motion; as well as we make the will and understanding 
to be faculties by which the actions of choosing and perceiving 
are produced, which are but several modes of thinking: and 
we may as properly say that it is the singing faculty sings, 
and the dancing faculty dances, as that the will chooses. . . .?* 
It is to be recalled here especially that in cases of voluntary 
choice it is the empirical ego which is apprehended as efficient, 
and not the Self: for this Self is not given in attention, but 
is that to which the whole state of self-consciousness appears 
as a presentation of dual emphasis. 
The act of will, so called, appears after a condition of inhibi- 
tion due to the existence of two opposed and incompatible 
objective presentations each of which tends to develope. 
These objects may be in the realm of impulses to act, or in 
purely ideational realms; in both cases the process is the 
same. The mutual inhibition to the development of the 
two incompatibles carries with it an emphasis in attention of 
the ideas anticipatory of the acts whether these be impulsive 
or ideational. 
The act of will appears when under such conditions of 
inhibition there arises from within the empirical ego an 
efficiency, appreciated as such, which enforces one of the two 
incompatibles, and minimizes the other ; which welcomes one, 
and rejects the other. 
That the essence of this act of will is the reaction of the 
empirical ego upon its object is of course perfectly clear. 
“There is,” says Shadworth Hodgson ? “a class of actions, 
1 Human Understanding, book ii. chap. xxi. 17. 
2 Mind, \xii. p. 177.
-P-A-G-E-565
RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 551 
namely volitions and deliberations ending in choice, which 
cannot be disassociated from any positive idea which we can 
form of ourselves.” And it is this ‘‘ positive idea of ourself,” 
which we have agreed to call the empirical ego. 
Mr. F. H. Bradley’ has described this experience very 
accurately as follows :—‘‘Confining ourselves then to cona- 
tion where it exists at its proper level,’ we discover there in 
any case some inseparable characters. These essential features 
are the aspect of a ‘not-myself, and of a ‘myself? hindered 
by this, together with an idea with which the ‘myself? feels 
itself one. And all these aspects must be experienced at 
once if conation is to exist.” Passing over other points in 
this quotation, we may note here merely the introspective 
experience described as the “‘idea of a change containing the 
removal of the hindrance, an idea with which the ‘ myself? 
feels itself one.’ The ‘‘ myself,” i.e. the empirical ego, 
emphasizes this idea which breaks the deadlock of obstructed 
impulses, or contradictory concepts,—which ‘removes the 
hindrance” as Mr. Bradley puts it ;—and this because it is 
of the same fundamental nature as that element of the object 
which it thus emphasizes; i.e. the element emphasized is 
“an idea with which the ‘myself? feels itself one.” 
So constant indeed is our recognition of the oneness of 
the empirical ego in the will act with the emphasized element 
in its object that our very cognition of the empirical ego is 
to a great extent bound up with our cognition of conative 
action. As Shadworth Hodgson well says* “our perception 
of ourselves as agents . . . takes place in and through com- 
plex acts of volition. These are the acts in which we trace 
1 Mind, N.S. 40, p. 438. 
2] have already noted in the footnote to Sec. 7, and in a previous 
chapter, that Mr. Bradley would apparently have us limit conation to the 
distinct act of choice.’ In this, if I understand him correctly, I cannot 
follow him. 
3 Metaphysic of Experience, iii. p. 164.
-P-A-G-E-566
552 THE SELF 
the union of the subject and its consciousness”; or as I should 
say, the union of the empirical ego with its object. 
In this connection it may be noted that this introspective 
recognition of the sameness of nature of the empirical ego, 
and of the part of its object which is emphasized in the act 
of will, which I with Mr. Bradley confidently ask the reader 
to test in his own experience, is a fact which is distinctly 
corroborative of the general view here maintained that all 
parts of consciousness are fundamentally of the same nature. 
Sec. 9. We do not find any relation of “feeling” to 
objectiveness similar to that found in the voluntary act where 
the empirical ego is always explicit : and this we should expect 
would be the case if “‘ feeling” is of the nature attributed 
to it,—if it is the empirical ego not yet explicit: for such 
relation to objectiveness would imply explicitness in the 
presented ‘‘feeling” which would therefore be transformed 
into the empirical ego, and would no longer be recognized 
as “‘ feeling.” 
On the other hand, as the conative relation of the empirical 
ego to its objects is clear, we should expect to find a general 
acknowledgment of the inexplicit conative nature of “‘ feel- 
ing” in relation to objective presentations. That the 
existence of this relation is very generally acknowledged I 
think will be granted ; it appears especially clear when we 
consider the relation of “‘ feeling” to attention and to belief 
to which we shall refer later. 
B. The Efficiency of the Self in Relation to its Presentations 
Sec. 10. We may now ask whether evidence is discover- 
able indicating that as the empirical ego is efficient in 
modifying the nature of its objects, so the Self is efficient 
in modifying the nature of the presentations to the Self. 
We have just seen how clear is the recognition of the 
empirical ego as modifying the nature of its objects. And 
   
-P-A-G-E-567
RELATIONS BETWEEN EGO AND SELF 553 
when we study our neighbors, when we are reasonably sure 
that they are thoroughly lacking in the experience of the 
empirical ego in self-consciousness, and note their statements 
which indicate the nature of their fields of attention, then we 
as clearly note the action of the Self in modifying the presen- 
tations which accrue to it. 
I listened lately to a vigorous friendly argument between 
a well known professor of Sociology, and an eminent ‘‘cor- 
poration lawyer,” concerning the responsibility of the Direc- 
tors of a certain railway for the fatalities attending a collision. 
The same facts were presented to both, in other words the 
presentations stimulating the flow of thought were practically 
the same for both, both were familiar with all the conditions, 
both were apparently devoid of self-consciousness. But the 
Selves to which accrued these presentations of approximately 
the same nature were diverse ; and the complex elements of 
these practically identical presentations were most diversely 
emphasized by their diverse Selves. The lawyer unhesitat- 
ingly emphasized the elements of the discussion which tended 
to exonerate the Directors of the company; the professor 
with as little hesitation emphasized all the elements which 
related to the welfare of society at large, and to the interests 
of the masses rather than of the corporation which he claimed 
existed merely to serve society. 
In like manner the same impulse complexes if aroused, 
where no self-consciousness is involved, in two men of diverse 
characters or in the same individual under diverse conditions 
result in very diverse reactions. The miser emphasizes the 
impulse to protect his property, dwelling on the fact that the 
poor man before him is merely one of many.. The benevolent 
man, appealed to by the same poor man, emphasizes the 
impulse to help him, even at the cost of his own discomfort 
or loss. The same individual in like manner may act the 
miser’s part on one day when the form of his Self is deter- 
mined by the fact that he has been discouraged by a fall in 
 
-P-A-G-E-568
  554 THE SELF 
the price of stocks; or may act the part of the benevolent 
man on another day when his Self is diverse because he has 
heard from his banker of some successful sale of securities 
which he had thought to be of doubtful value. And all 
this may go on without the least recognition of the empirical 
ego in self-consciousness, when however we witness objec- 
tively the expression of the action of the Self upon its 
presentations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-569
  
CHAPTER XXV 
THE RELATION OF EFFICIENCY BETWEEN THE EM- 
PIRICAL EGO AND THE SELF, AND THE GENERAL 
QUALITIES OF PRESENTATIONS 
WE are now prepared to gather together certain important 
considerations which have been studied briefly from chapter 
to chapter in Part u. of Book 1. If our hypothesis as to the 
nature of the empirical ego and of the Self is correct we 
should be able to verify it in connection with the observation 
of their influence upon the general qualities which are found 
in connection with all presentations, and with the reciprocal 
influence upon the empirical ego, and upon the Self, of these 
general qualities as developed in connection with presenta- 
tions. 
A. Tue Emprricat Eco anp THe Seir as RELATED 
witH ManiFoLpNEss AND INTENSITY 
I, The Effect upon the Empirical Ego and the Self 
Sec. 1. We have seen in Book 1. that all presentations 
display more or less of manifoldness, and more or less of 
intensity ; the emphasis of the one quality being inversely 
related to the emphasis of the other. A high degree of mani- 
foldness in the object contrasted with the empirical ego 
implies widespread activities of about the same effectiveness 
 
-P-A-G-E-570
  556 THE SELF 
in closely connected neural elements ; while a high degree of 
intensity implies a narrow range of such effective neural 
activities. It would appear that the former condition would 
be more likely than the latter to arouse to heightened activity 
a broad undifferentiable systemic neururgic mass such as 
corresponds, under our view, with the experienced empirical 
ego. We should therefore expect to find that a presentation 
in which manifoldness is marked is more likely, and a very 
intense presentation less likely, to appear in connection with 
the appearance of the empirical ego as a self-conscious pre- 
sentation to the Self. The very intense presentation would 
be more likely to stand alone, i.e. without any empirical 
ego. 
This is surely a matter of every day experience. I do not 
usually have in mind the empirical ego as affected by a vivid 
light, or by a piercing noise, or by a very sharp pain: the 
presentations consist of the light, the sound, the pain, almost 
in isolation: only after the presentations have passed or have 
developed, and have aroused other presentations of a broader 
manifoldness, (e.g. thoughts of the head light of the loco- 
motive bearing down on me, of the whistle of the fire engine 
in the street, of the burning ash that has fallen from my cigar 
upon my hand,) do I note any experience of my empirical 
ego as contrasted with the objectified presentation. On the 
other hand it is the broader presentations which are most 
distinctly found to involve the appearance in consciousness 
of the empirical ego: for instance, the percepts of ‘‘ objects 
in the outer world,” which are of enormous complexity and 
of marked manifoldness; those objects which are bound 
together in that immensely complex system which we call 
our social life ; these are the presentations which most readily 
compel the consideration in attention of the empirical ego in 
contrast with the related objects which appear in contrast with 
the empirical ego. 
What we have said above may be restated in another form,
-P-A-G-E-571
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 557 
viz. that while all objects in self-conscious states must modify 
the nature of the empirical ego, nevertheless a notably mani- 
fold object must produce more distinct effects upon the nature 
of the empirical ego than one in which manifoldness is not 
marked, while intensity is. 
Sec. 2. If our conception of the nature of “feeling” is 
correct we should expect to find that narrow, intense, vivid, 
presentations are less likely to arouse ‘‘ feeling,” than broader 
presentations which involve an emphasis of manifoldness. 
The reader will I think agree that this expectation is met in 
our experience if he refers to the examples given in the 
previous section, and notes that ‘‘ feeling” is aroused by the 
same general types of presentations which lead to the apprecia- 
tion of the empirical ego. 
Sec. 3. If what we have said in Sec. 1 is true, and if the 
empirical ego is a simulacrum of the Self, it should be possible 
to make similar observations in relation to the Self: viz. 
that while all presentations must modify the nature of the 
Self nevertheless a presentation which has marked manifold- 
ness is more likely to produce effects upon the nature of the 
Self which will be observable objectively, than one in which 
manifoldness is not, but intensity is, marked. 
Objective observation shows us that narrow, unmanifold, 
presentations, of which vivid sensations are the best examples, 
produce narrow effects upon the character of the man to 
whom they are given. These effects are sometimes of very 
distinctive form, but in the main they do not seem to involve 
the whole system, being in fact, in a vast proportion of cases, 
of what we call the reflex type: i.e. they affect limited minor 
noetic systems rather than the complex system of noetic 
systems as a whole. On the other hand the broader, fuller, 
more manifold, presentations of which the best examples are 
what we call our thoughts,—considerations of objects in the
-P-A-G-E-572
558 THE SELF 
outer world, especially in their social relations,—very dis- 
tinctly affect the nature of the Self as it is judged objectively : 
they change the mood of the man, they alter the very nature 
of his character from moment to moment, and if they persist 
for long, or are frequently recurrent, they permanently alter 
the form of the Self. 
The vivid flash of lightning which has intensity but lacks 
manifoldness may make a man wince, or it may affect him 
somewhat more broadly and lead to an emotional state of 
fear, but without marked alteration of his general attitude 
towards life. But serious consideration of the objects around 
him in their multitudinous relations, which involves presen- 
tations of a high degree of manifoldness, invariably produces 
objective evidence of a real change in his Self. 
II. The Effect of the Empirical Ego and of the Self 
Sec. 4. If what we have said above is true we should 
expect to note that while the empirical ego must modify its 
objects in all cases this modification will be more noticeable 
where the object is markedly manifold than where it is 
markedly intense: the broad empirical ego must find more 
points of attachment as it were in the object in the former 
case than in the latter. If this is true we should also note 
similar characteristics in relation to the Self. And these 
expectations are met in our experience. 
In our self-conscious states we do not commonly appreciate 
that we ourselves are concerned to alter the nature of our 
vivid sensations while we do concern ourselves with the 
manipulation of the presentations of thought which are 
notably manifold. | 
And the same without question is true of “feeling” which 
warps the realm of thought but is not appreciated as capable 
of modification of intense sensational experiences. 
So of the Self. The character a man displays makes little 
 
-P-A-G-E-573
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 559 
difference in his discriminative modification of presentations 
of a narrow, intense type: we assume that the vivid sensa- 
tions remain about the same for each of us. But the man’s 
special character does make much difference in the form of 
development of the broader and manifold presentations of 
thought: the example of the lawyer and of the sociologist in 
facing the same problem given in Chapter xxrv., Sec. 10, suf- 
fices to bring this matter before us clearly. Such instances are 
of every day occurrence, and go to show that in connection 
with a high degree of the manifoldness of presentations the 
opportunity is given to the Self to select in accord with its 
inherent nature, and to modify the presentations which are 
given, as would not otherwise be the case. 
III. The Empirical Ego and the Self in Relation to Attention 
Sec. 5. Attention, as we have seen in earlier chapters, is 
the appreciated relation of a given intensity to the manifold- 
ness of the rest of the noetic pattern of the moment. The 
persistence of a state of attention is due to a persistence of 
a given intensity, and we should be led to expect to note that 
attention alters the whole noetic pattern and with it the nature 
of the Self, and of the empirical ego if it happens to be 
explicit. 
Examples here are not needed, for in the instances given 
above of the modification of the empirical ego by its objects, 
and of the Self by its presentations, where we have referred 
to the objects and to the presentations, we have dealt with 
presentations which are almost always marked in attention. 
Sec. 6. We may turn then to the consideration of the 
efficiency of the mass of the noetic system upon attention. 
Here we are dealing with the efficiency of the Self in relation 
to attention to given presentations ; and, so far as this action 
is represented in self-consciousness, with the efficiency of the 
empirical ego in relation to attention to given objects.  
-P-A-G-E-574
  560 THE SELF 
If we consider first the relation of the empirical ego to its 
objects we note that if the empirical ego is of the nature 
claimed for it then its efficiency in relation to its object should 
be evidenced by the emphasis of certain elements in the object 
which are assimilable by it. This emphasis would have to 
do with changes in the relation of intensities within the whole 
mass of the object, and would therefore involve changes in 
the field of attention; and the very action of the empirical 
ego upon its object thus considered may as we have seen be 
equally well described as the influence of this empirical ego 
upon attention. 
It is not worth while at this juncture to stop to illustrate 
this point, for in the instances given in the preceding chapter 
of the efficiency of the empirical ego upon its objects we have 
dealt with cases where these objects have been held in atten- 
tion by the empirical ego. 
Sec. 7. But if the relation of the empirical ego to its 
object in self-consciousness is representive of the relation 
of the Self to its presentation, then we should also expect to 
note distinctly certain changes in the nature of the field of 
attention as the result of the action of the Self. Here again 
we scarcely need to illustrate our point, for in the instances 
given above of the efficiency of the Self upon the presenta- 
tions to the Self we have dealt with cases where the presen- 
tations are held in attention. 
If in states of self-consciousness we study the objects 
related to the empirical ego which are in attention we discover 
them modified by the empirical ego through the emphasis of 
certain elements and the minimizing of certain other elements. 
So when the field of attention is filled with successions of 
presentations which involve no recognition of an empirical 
ego, then in reflecting upon these non-self-conscious states 
we note that here also the presentations are modified by the 
emphasis of certain elements and the minimizing of certain 
other elements, and in a manner which cannot be accounted  
-P-A-G-E-575
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 561 
for in any way by the nature of the presentations them- 
selves. This modification comes from the Self. 
Sec. 8. There are times when the stimuli from the outer 
world and their resultants are so forceful that they appear to 
be alone powerful in determining the form of the neururgic 
pattern which corresponds with the noetic pattern of the 
moment the marked configuration of which is the field of 
attention. But it is evident that this can never be actually 
the case. As the unemphatic neururgic mass always has its 
part in determining the form of the neururgic pattern of any 
given moment, so the Self must always have its part in 
determining the form of the noetic pattern of the moment. 
As the empirical ego acts upon its object in what we experience 
as voluntary attention, so in like manner does the Self in a 
more fundamental manner select, and exhibit conation or 
“will? But such action of the Self is not itself experienced 
as a presentation; it can be known only by its effect upon 
the man’s modes of expression: for it is the empirical ego 
and not the Self that is given in the will-act of explicitly 
voluntary attention. It is true that only by objective obser- 
vation can we note the action of the Self to be similar to that 
which appears in such voluntary action as can be experienced 
in our self-conscious states ; but in such objective observation 
we see the Self acting upon its presentations exactly as we 
know by experience that the empirical ego acts upon its 
objects in volition. Subjectively all that we are able to note 
is a sense of the unity of the ‘‘rest of consciousness,” i.e. the 
Self, with the presentation as modified. And we realize that 
the presentations which fill the field of attention are modified 
from no cause that is inherent in them: which is made clear 
in the fact that when in retrospect we consider such occur- 
rences we are tempted at times to look upon the modification 
as due to a mysterious influence from without ourselves 
(our empirical egos) ; we are led to claim that we have an 
inspiration as we say; and because the recipient cannot 
2N 
 
-P-A-G-E-576
  562 THE SELF 
experience in attention the source of this “inspiration,” as it 
comes from the non-presentable Self, prophets have often 
ascribed the result to some mysterious act of the Deity. 
This influence of the Self upon its presentations is under 
our theory necessarily of constant occurrence and is clearly 
of the most fundamental importance. It influences the form 
of sense impressions, of perceptual and conceptual trains, and 
of impulsive reactive states, as they appear in attention. 
Naturally this influence is most distinctly marked when 
sense impressions of diverse nature vie with one another to 
control the noetic pattern of the moment, when disparate 
percepts and concepts stand opposed, when diverse impulses 
clash. In our normal states of consciousness there are always 
co-existent many intensities of many elements, some of these 
elements quarrelling amongst themselves, if we may so speak, 
while some are perfectly harmonious ;—some tending to pro- 
duce a ‘‘noetic pattern” which demands separation from the 
prevailing Self, while others join with the prevailing pattern 
and bring out of it new forms without separating themselves 
from the main psychic mass. 
When a special intensity fails to emphasize an element 
which is consistent with the noetic pattern existent at the 
moment in the Self, while another special intensity does 
emphasize an element which is consistent with the noetic 
pattern then existent in the Self, then we have a very clear 
case of the action of the Self. It acts as a whole to emphasize 
and hold in prominence the partial presentation which is 
compatible with its noetic pattern of the moment ; and it as 
a whole fails to act in relation to the partial presentation which 
is incompatible with its noetic pattern of the moment. The 
incompatible noetic pattern, which under other conditions 
might be formed, fails: the partial presentation whose 
emphasis would be required for its persistence disappears 
from the field of attention. This constitutes the act of atten- 
tion by the Self upon the presentations which accrue to it.
-P-A-G-E-577
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 563 
It is not self-conscious. No volitional act is appreciated. 
Nevertheless as objectively considered the efficiency of the 
Self appears definite and clear. 
Sec. 9. ‘There are many cases also where there accrue to 
the Self two partial presentations which equally tend to be 
held in attention. The state of tension may be, and usually 
is, dissolved by some change of character in the partial presen- 
tations themselves. But it may also be, and often is, dis- 
solved by the reaction of the Self: and frequently in what 
upon reflection seems to be a most mysterious manner. If we 
are self-conscious we have the phenomenon of choice: but 
we are here referring to cases where not being self-conscious 
the act of will is not given in attention. Nevertheless an 
objective observer would note the same hesitancy, and final 
determination of a definite course of action, in the one case 
as in the other. 
“We know” says Prof. James ‘‘ what it is to get out of 
bed on a freezing morning in a room without a fire, and how 
the very vital principle within us protests against the ordeal. 
Probably most persons have lain on certain mornings for an 
hour at a time unable to brace themselves to the resolve. We 
think how late we shall be, how the duties of the day will 
suffer; we say ‘I must get up, this is ignominious,’ etc. ; 
but still the warm couch feels too delicious, the cold outside 
too cruel, and resolution faints away and postpones itself again 
and again just as it seemed on the verge of bursting the 
resistance and passing over into the decisive act.’ The state 
as thus far described by Dr. James is one of clear self-con- 
sciousness in which the empirical ego fails to break the dead- 
lock. But he goes on to say ‘‘ Now how do we ever get up 
under such circumstances? If I may generalize from my 
own experience, we more often than not get up without any 
_ struggle or decision at all.” (Or to put it differently, we get. 
up without any evidence of the efficiency of the empirical 
1 Psychology, ii. p. 524.  
-P-A-G-E-578
  564 THE SELF 
ego in determining in a voluntary act the emphasis of one 
of the incompatible impulses.) ‘‘ We suddenly find that we 
have got up.” Some influence from a source which is not 
in the field of attention has broken the deadlock. Prof. 
James explains the fact by saying ‘‘a fortunate lapse of con- 
sciousness occurs; we forget both the warmth and the cold ; 
we fall into some reverie connected with the day’s life, in the 
course of which the idea flashes across us ‘ Hollo, I must lie 
here no longer,’ an idea which at the lucky instant awakens 
no contradictory or paralyzing suggestions and consequently 
produces immediately its appropriate motor effects. It was 
our acute consciousness of both the warmth and the cold 
during the period of struggle which paralyzed our activity 
then, and kept our idea of rising in the condition of wish and 
not of will. "The moment these inhibitory ideas ceased, the 
original idea exerted its effects.” 
But what is it that makes ‘“‘the inhibitory ideas cease,” 
and ‘‘the original idea” remain to exert its force? It is 
surely due to no noticeable change in the environmental con- 
ditions of impression, nor to any change in the nature of the 
conceptual trains themselves. It is due to no influence of 
the empirical ego. But out of the air, as it were, comes some 
influence which emphasizes one and minimizes the other of 
the two incompatible impulses. This influence it appears 
clear is from the Self which cannot be given as a presentation ; 
from the Self which, as it emphasizes one and minimizes 
the other of the two incompatible impulses, must evidently 
be of the same fundamental nature with that which is 
emphasized. 
Sec. 10. The action of the Self and of the empirical 
ego is clearly observed in relation to the acquisition of habits. 
The musician who would learn to play the piano perfectly 
must in the beginning with voluntary effort attend to certain 
sensations telling him of artificially constrained motions of 
his fingers ; as he continues his practice his efforts to maintain
-P-A-G-E-579
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 565 
attention upon these sensations becomes less and less promi- 
nent in consciousness; and finally he finds that actually he 
is unable to think of them at all. In the beginning the 
efficiency of the noetic system becomes explicit in the act of 
will of the empirical ego determining attention. But gradually, 
as the whole noetic system becomes modified, self-conscious 
effort disappears, although the Self still determines attention 
to the presentations. Finally when the neural activities 
correspondent with these presentations become fully assimi- 
lated with the whole neururgic system the presentations 
disappear, are absorbed into the Self as it were. 
Sec. 11. We may note here one point of practical import- 
ance in connection with the action of the empirical ego in 
maintaining attention, in regard to the relation between 
voluntary attention and what we speak of as the retention 
of ideas, which is but another way of describing our ability 
to bring into attention certain presentations which we find 
important in our life. The acquisition of new ideas normally 
involves attention to these ideas for a longer or shorter period ; 
and this acquisition is usually greatly aided when the active 
effort of the empirical ego appears in the rivetting of attention 
upon them. Now by the acquisition of a new idea we mean 
that this idea has become so connected with our every day 
normal waking consciousness that we are able upon occasion 
to retain it in attention. . What we assert above therefore is 
that this connection is more likely to be made when the idea 
was originally so intense that it appeared in the focus of 
attention ; but that it is especially likely to be made when 
the whole conscious system, as represented in the empirical 
ego, by its reaction upon the idea holds it in attention when 
otherwise it would have disappeared. 
Evidently we might have been led to look for just these 
facts as the result of our study of attention had they not been 
brought to our notice by their importance in our normal life, 
and by their pedagogical significance. For the fact that a 
 
-P-A-G-E-580
  566 THE SELF 
new idea appears within the focus of attention means that it 
is in some measure related with the broad psychic system ; 
and if it is thus related it must have gained attachments with 
this broad system which may at a future time lead to its 
revival. If the new idea does not appear in, or near, the 
focus of attention, if we may so speak, it is because it has 
not gained these attachments ; and in such a case its revival 
in future moments might well be expected to fail. 
But beyond this, the fact that a new idea is held in attention 
by voluntary effort means that it has been able to assimilate 
with the whole mass of the psychic system to such a degree 
that the Self clings to it, and sustains it to so marked a degree 
that the simulacrum of the Self, the empirical ego, appears 
in a state of self-consciousness as thus sustaining it; and 
under such circumstances evidently we should expect it to 
become part and parcel of the broad psychic system which 
prevails in our every day waking life, and therefore should 
expect it to be involved with those normal movements of 
attention to which we refer when we speak of the idea as 
being permanently retained. 
B. Tue Reration or THE Empiricat Eco anD OF THE 
SetF To REALNESS 
I. The Effect upon the Empirical Ego and upon the Self 
Sec. 12. If the emphasized broad undifferentiable minor 
neururgic system which we suppose to correspond with the 
empirical ego is affected by a specially emphatic activity in 
a relatively limited neural part; then evidently the form of 
the whole neururgic pattern in the emphasized broad system 
will be more likely to be modified if the activity of the part 
is relatively stable than would be the case were this special 
activity merely of a fleeting type. Correspondingly we 
should say that an object which is relatively stable must affect
-P-A-G-E-581
   
     
       
                                       
   
      
     EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 567 
the nature of the empirical ego more quickly and effectively 
than an object that is relatively unstable. In other words 
objects in which a considerable degree of realness is developed 
should be those in connection with which we should note 
modifications of the empirical ego with which they are con- 
trasted. 
The most striking experiences of presentations that are 
relatively stable are those which are given when the psychic 
emphasis is determined by the stimulation of the body by a 
continuing stimulus from the environment. When a state 
of self-consciousness is developed under such conditions we 
should then expect to note some modification of the empirical 
ego which would not be noted where the stimulus is momen- 
tary and fleeting. That is, persistently intense sensations, 
and continuing percepts of objects in the outer world, if 
occurring in self-conscious states, should give us our clearest 
sense of the modification of the empirical ego. 
This is unquestionably a matter of every day experience. 
A continuous sound of bursting bombs, as I am writing this, 
changes the nature of my empirical ego so that I feel myself 
a being that is interested in the display of fireworks, and all 
the attendant disturbance of an election mass meeting: while 
a moment ago I was quite a different ego, determined to 
write out a given expression of a given thought. Now that 
the noise has ceased I am again at the writing, practically the 
empirical ego that existed before the explosion occurred. 
Sec. 13. If, as we hold, the relation existing between the 
Self and its presentations is analogous to the relation existing 
between the empirical ego and its objects: then we should 
expect to find evidence of modifications of the Self due to 
the action upon it of presentations in which realness is 
rked. While it is impossible to gain evidence of this 
introspection, nevertheless we may expect to find some 
fective evidence: for if the Self is fundamentally of the 
e nature as its presentations, the Self must eventually be 
   
-P-A-G-E-582
568 THE SELF 
    
   
              
   
            
   
            
    
   modified by the persistence in attention of such very real 
presentations. 
Clearly there is much objective evidence going to show 
that the nature of the Self varies thus within limits from time 
to time, as is indicated by the different moods of a man, as we 
say. And if we observe a man closely we note evidence that 
such changes of his Self vary with the recognizable realness 
of the presentations within his field of attention. Quite apart 
from any self-consciousness, the naturally joyous man may 
become morose if he hears of losses of property, provided 
these losses appear very real to him,—provided, as we say, 
he fully realizes their importance: and on the other hand the 
morose man may become a joyful happy one if some good 
fortune comes to him, and brings with it presentations of a 
pleasing nature which persist and thus become real. 
Apart from such more or less superficial and transient 
modifications of the Self, it is exceedingly difficult, as we 
have seen above, to change the general nature of the Self 
fundamentally and permanently. We should therefore ex- 
pect to find it possible to observe the effect of very real 
presentations in changing the more fundamental nature of 
the Self only in cases where they are markedly persistent : 
and this persistence itself involves a high degree of noetic 
stability or realness. 
To illustrate this point we may take the case of what we 
call religious conversion, which at first sight does not seem 
very favorable to this contention. We see a man whose life 
is perhaps altogether given up to personal advancement, for 
whom the real things of life are those which concern his social 
preferment or business success, brought to think of the world 
in which he has been living as wholly hollow and false,—led 
even to abandon it altogether in favor of a monastic life 
privation: for him then the real presentations are no lo 
the views of social life which had affected him before 
conversion, but his notions of the value to his soul of w:
-P-A-G-E-583
      
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 569 
he thinks of as not of this world. The changes in the nature 
of, the man’s Self thus described as objectively viewed seem 
often,to be rapid and notable at the moment of conversion, 
but if so it is to be noted that we find ourselves unable to 
count on the persistence of the changed Self. The converted 
man may very readily become a backslider. The Self only 
becomes a fundamentally changed Self if the newly gained 
presentations within the field of attention of the converted 
man remain permanently real; i.e. if he persists in his new 
mode of thought for years; and then finally we find him a 
fundamentally altered Self,—a new man, quite diverse in 
character from the man of earlier years, as is shown by all 
the reactions he makes upon the many stimuli which reach 
him from his environment. What were temptations to him 
in his earlier life no longer affect his thought or action. His 
average mood will usually have changed altogether. 
Il. The Effect of the Empirical Ego and of the Self 
Sec. 14. Turning now to the consideration of the effect 
of the empirical ego upon the realness of its object, we note 
that if our hypotheses are valid we should expect to find that 
if an increment of neural activity which reaches the neururgic 
system considered as a whole is assimilated by any broad 
minor neururgic system within the total neururgic system, 
the increment of activity will thereby become more stable, 
and will affect a change in the form of the neururgic pattern 
of the whole system. Furthermore we must expect to meet 
with cases where two neururgic increments, incompatible with 
one another, accrue to some broad minor neururgic system 
at one and the same moment. In such cases the form of the 
broad minor neururgic mass would itself determine which of 
the two incompatibles would be assimilated and become 
stable. 
If our theory of a thoroughgoing neururgic and noetic
-P-A-G-E-584
  570 THE SELF 
correspondence is correct, then correspondences with the 
above situations should be noted in our life of reflection. 
If in a self-conscious state an object, a psychic increment as 
it were, appears accruing to such a broad minor noetic system 
as we hold the empirical ego to be, and is assimilated by it ; 
then we should expect that the influence of the empirical ego 
would appear in experience as tending to establish the stability 
of this object,—as tending to give it realness. 
As has been already remarked in Chapter xv., to which 
I would refer the reader, no one who examines his inner 
life with care can fail to notice how constantly and persistently 
his empirical ego is bound up with, and appears to enforce 
the realness of, objects which are readily assimilable, and is 
appreciated as discouraging the realness of those which are 
not readily assimilable. But this influence of the empirical 
ego in establishing the stability,—the realness,—of the object 
becomes clearer when in relation with the empirical ego appear 
two objects the complete realness of one of which is incom- 
patible with the complete realness of the other, both of which 
however persist for a more or less prolonged period in atten- 
tion, i.e. have a relative stability or realness, because both are 
in part assimilated, and yet neither fully assimilated. Then 
finally we find ourselves emphasizing the realness of one of 
the incompatibles and asserting our belief that one of the 
two is true or real, and that the other is false or unreal. In 
such cases the empirical ego is distinctly experienced as active 
in establishing the realness of the one of the two incompatible 
objects with which it most fully assimilates: we distinctly 
appreciate that we believe in what seems to us most in har- 
mony with our every day selves, i.e. with our empirical egos. 
In all cases of belief the process is the same, and it consists 
in the appearance from within the empirical ego of some 
influence which constrains us to resolve in some one direction 
the conscious opposition involved in doubt. It is from 
within the empirical ego that proceeds the power to take that
-P-A-G-E-585
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 571 
active part in the process which Dr. James speaks of as 
“loading the dice,” so far as this is apprehended. 
Sec. 15. If now we turn to the observation of the action 
of the Self upon presentations, we find much evidence that 
the Self determines the realness of presentations which are 
assimilable by it, just as we have seen that the empirical ego 
determines to a large extent the realness of its objects in self- 
conscious states. In this case however we cannot observe the 
Self “‘in action” so to speak, as we can observe introspectively 
the empirical ego willing as belief appears; for the Self in 
its very nature cannot appear as a presentation. We do 
observe however certain presentations becoming real, and 
persisting as real, for no reason inherent in themselves. As 
observers from without we see that the establishment of this 
realness is due to the character of the man,—due to the 
influence of his innermost Self. It is the man’s Self that 
thus to a great extent determines the realness of his presenta- 
tions; which realness, as we have already seen conditions his 
beliefs. 
Sec. 16. We are here dealing directly with the Self, and 
only indirectly with its simulacrum the empirical ego, which 
as we have seen is not implicated until a questioned realness 
is established in a self-conscious state in the field of attention 
in the act of belief ;1 and here I wish to emphasize the fact 
1If the psychic system is always implicated in the appreciation of 
realness, although only appreciated thus explicitly in belief, it cannot 
be true, as J. S. Mill held (note to his edition of Jas. Mill’s Analysis, 
p- 412), that the distinction “between thinking of a reality and repre- 
senting to ourselves an imaginary picture” is “ultimate and primordial.” 
Nor is it likely to be possible to hold with Stout (4m. Psy. ii. p. 260) 
that “to imagine is simply to think of an object, without believing, 
disbelieving, or doubting its existence.” Much more probable is it that 
we shall find fully defined belief fading off into states in which we 
recognize no measure of realness given from within. Taine indeed felt 
warranted in maintaining that each imagination involves a belief more or 
less momentary; but in speaking thus he seems to have failed to guard himself 
 
-P-A-G-E-586
    572 THE SELF 
that the Self is always implicated with the existence of the 
realness of the presentation of any special moment. 
A. The stability of a neururgic emphasis must always be 
determined by two factors ; 1st, by what we may call the inner 
efficiency of the emphasis itself, which is for the most part 
determined by the forcefulness of environmental stimuli, or 
of the resultants of such stimuli; and 2nd, by the nature of 
the sum total of activities of the mass of the whole nervous 
system as exclusive of the emphasis. 
B. At times, a careless view might lead us to think that 
the stability of a given neururgic emphasis is given solely 
by its own inner efficiency ; but evidently this can never be 
actually true, if it is true that a thoroughgoing reciprocal 
efficiency exists between all parts of the neururgic system. 
There must, if we may so speak, always be some measure 
of welcome, or rejection, of the emphasis by the whole 
neururgic system even when this is overlooked ; and it would 
thus appear that the undifferentiable mass of unemphatic 
against the common error of reading back into a past state the characteristics 
which we find in the revivals of self-conscious states as they are viewed in 
reflection. 
The fact seems to be that our imaginations exist in different realms of 
realness from our every day conceptions of reality. Each imagination 
has some degree of realness in its own realm, and so far as it has this 
realness the psychic system must have its influence in the determination 
of that realness. That, however, does not imply that this influence of 
the system must always be in any sense explicit: it does, however, imply 
that it is in some measure implicit; and if this is true it is impossible 
to draw a hard and fast line between imagination and knowledge. This 
view is verified in the fact that those imaginations which we call “ pure 
fancies,” are closely allied with what we call the world of “make 
believe,” which without doubt, most people would describe as involving 
imaginary states. Yet it is clear that in the very name “ make believe ” 
there is connoted a recognition of an act of the ego which compels the 
belief, which, in other words, wills to overlook the inhibitions of every day 
life, and to allow the flow of thought in the fanciful combinations sug 
gested by mere association. yet
-P-A-G-E-587
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 575 
which thus enforces the realness which conditions the belief 
is within consciousness; it does not inhere in the field of 
attention ; it must come from within the very Self. 
As we have seen in previous chapters, this Self is of the 
nature of a huge bundle of instinct experiences, which are 
so vague, and broad, and undifferentiable, that they cannot 
appear in attention, but make up what I have called the field 
of inattention. When therefore from within this Self,—this 
mass of undifferentiable instinct experiences,—there appears 
an influence which determines the realness of a presentation, 
this influence is due to the existence of instinctive tendencies 
of the most fundamental character, of the most thorough 
coordination, which act without telling us (by attracting our 
attention as presentations) that they are acting or are going 
to act. 
This silently efficient Self is in the main the resultant of 
our inheritance from the ages, and is in only a relatively small 
degree due to our own experience in this life. It speaks of 
the experience of all our ancestors ; of those who were men, 
and of that long line of living forms from whom the first of 
human beings were descended. These racial experiences 
have impressed upon us apperceptive systems, and impulse 
series, in which certain forms are implicit. When some con- 
ception presents itself to us in which this form is explicit, 
then it is that the Self silently acts to establish the realness 
of the conception: it stands ever ready to assimilate this 
conception. Thus the Self, altogether within consciousness 
but nevertheless not given as an empirical ego, acting so 
silently that it appears merely as a mysterious influence, 
“loads the dice” in favor of the realness of the conception 
which is assimilable. It is the existence of the implicit form 
in the Self that thus determines the realness of the conception, 
i.e. its relative permanence. 
The Self as I have said above speaks of the experience of 
all our ancestors, of those who were men, and of man’s long 
 
-P-A-G-E-588
576 THE SELF 
line of progenitors of diverse animal forms. It speaks with 
impressive force the voice of this racial experience. If it 
breaks down a hesitancy, a doubt, it, in that very fact, raises 
objections from racial experience to the notion which is over- 
thrown. It says to us, ‘‘the elements which are present in 
the field of attentive consciousness represent but a paltry 
array of experiential effects; I who am the resultant of the 
experience of the ages judge that what, speaking objectively, 
you call the belief which is appearing in the field of attention, 
and which I overthrow, has a dangerous outcome. It may 
be impossible to place my objection in the field of attention 
in ratiocinative form, but my experience from the vast aeons 
of time leads me to see that the realness, the truth, is on my 
side,—that the essence of the statement which appears in the 
field of attention must be modified if it is to harmonize with 
this racial experience. This realness is maintained by my 
influence ; and the doubt, if it recur and persist, should 
merely serve to emphasize the necessity of restatement of 
the conceptual presentations involved, so that my act may 
appear to accord with the outcome of ratiocinative process.” 
We thus perceive more clearly the significance of the 
statement made in an earlier chapter that the Self is the con- 
servative part of consciousness ; its influence is habitually in 
favor of the old, and in opposition to the new that does not 
harmonize with the old. 
Sec. 19. According then to the view here presented, the 
realness of a presentation is always determined in part by 
the influence of the whole psychic system ;—i.e. by the Self. 
Extraneous forces, persistent and powerful stimulations from 
our environment, inherited ‘‘ psychical dispositions,” tradi- 
tional influences, the habits engendered by custom, may at 
times, and in fact do to a large extent, have a large part in 
the making of this realness ; but they do so only because they 
themselves have had to do with the moulding of the form of 
the whole psychic system the mass of which is the Self. And
-P-A-G-E-589
  
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 577 
this Self must necessarily in all cases be involved in the 
establishment of the realness of the presentations given to it. 
In certain cases the measure of realness of a given presen- 
tation is placed in contradistinction to the measure of realness 
of an incompatible presentation, and then we have the con- 
dition of doubt. The efficiency of the Self is implicated in 
the momentary establishment of the realness of each of the 
given incompatibles. It is also implicated in the changed 
realness of the one of the incompatibles whose realness finally 
gains the ascendency. But this influence is not always 
explicit, and in fact in most cases it is not a matter which 
appears at all in the field of attention: usually quite without 
appreciation of the efficient Self, one of the incompatibles 
becomes real, the other unreal: the doubt disappears with- 
out anything like a recognition of the basis of the accrued 
realness. 
But as we have already seen, whenever the action of the 
Self does become explicit in attention it appears as the action 
of the empirical ego which is efficient in the determination of 
which of the two incompatibles is to be real in clear conscious- 
ness ;—which, in other words, wills, and leads the man to 
say ‘‘I believe.” 
Sec. 20. An interesting corroboration of our hypothesis 
that what psychologists call ‘‘feeling” is the inexplicit em- 
pirical ego, is found in connection with the influence which 
is attributed to ‘‘ feeling” in relation to belief. 
When we take an objective view and refer to those condi- 
tions of realness which are liable to lead a man to the experi- 
ence of belief (which conditions as we have seen men often 
carelessly speak of as beliefs) we note that he is influenced by 
what we know to be the nature of the man’s Self which when 
presented appears as its simulacrum the empirical ego. In 
like manner we find him influenced by what he would describe 
as his experience of ‘‘ feeling.” 
20
-P-A-G-E-590
    
578 THE SELF 
And turning to the self-conscious experience of believing, 
we find as we have seen that when belief is clear cut we 
recognize the efficiency of the empirical ego. When however 
the state of belief is not distinct but is vague, then we are all 
likely to ascribe the breaking of the deadlock of doubt to 
“mere feeling.” Prof. James makes frequent reference to 
this fact in his Varieties of Religious Experience. 
Ill 
Sec. 21. It seems appropriate here to consider a certain 
class of presentations the nature of which is dependent upon 
their experienced relation to the empirical ego, and in connec- 
tion with which an especial degree of realness is developed. 
I refer to those special presentations which we experience in 
the process of sense perception, and which we designate as 
percepts. . 
As Dr. Stout says, it is not impossible to speak of the 
appreciation of the fact that I am desiring, doubting, im- 
patient, or resentful, as cases of perception; but in the 
common usage of psychologists, which I shall follow, percep- 
tion means sense perception. The fact that we find it 
possible to use the word in the broad way referred to by Dr. 
Stout merely tends to enforce the view that all presentations 
are fundamentally of the same nature. 
Percepts proper involve sensational emphases, as is indi- 
cated by the above noted fact that we may always speak of 
them as sense-percepts. The fact that they thus involve 
definite sensational emphases distinguishes them from con- 
cepts, which latter do not involve distinct sensational emphases 
although they may involve characteristics which appear as 
reconstructions of sense data, and of many of the other attri- 
butes of percepts. That concepts as a class are to be separated 
from percepts as a class is clear in the fact that certain concepts. 
e.g. ‘‘the functions of calculus,” or “‘the law of develop- 
ment,” seem to involve no possible sensational emphases.
-P-A-G-E-591
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 579 
Percepts are also distinguished from imaginations, which 
latter are when thus distinguished thought of as mere sub 
jective states, which means that they are bound up with the 
appreciated empirical ego. The contrast between imagina- 
tions and percepts therefore indicates that the latter are always 
objects in a self-conscious state in which the object-subject 
relation is developed. It is clear however that not all mere 
objects are percepts for the distinctly non-perceptual concepts 
above referred to may well be objects in self-conscious states. 
Again sense-percepts are always spatially qualified ; that is 
they always involve as part of their essence characteristics 
which when developed lead us to their ascription to the in- 
fluence of objects in a world outside and beyond ourselves. 
But clearly it is not the mere presence of this spatial quality 
which makes percepts what they are, for we experience certain 
concepts which also involve spatial characteristics: e.g. the 
concepts ‘‘ the solar system as a whole,” or ‘‘ the other side of 
the moon.” These concepts cannot be based upon what has. 
been or can be perceived ; although as they develop we find 
that they involve the connotation, that if the conditions were 
other than they are the appropriate object might be perceived : 
they may thus be described as permanent possibilities of per- 
ception, to change slightly Mill’s phrase. 
Percepts are notably qualified by realness. Nothing is 
more real than the existence of them and of their outer world 
basis which is of the essence of their connotation. But as 
other presentations than percepts are notably real this realness 
itself can of course not be the quality which gives them their 
special character. 
But beyond all this, percepts are involved with an apprecia 
tion of an empirical ego alert and affected by them. Without 
this appreciation of the relation to the empirical ego we cannot 
properly be said to perceive. We thus find that the percept 
is a presentation which is sensationally and spatially qualified, 
and which developes a high degree of realness, but especially 
 
-P-A-G-E-592
  580 THE SELF 
in conjunction with a sense of an efficient relation to the 
empirical ego. If any one of these four characteristics is 
wanting in a presentation, this presentation is not a percept. 
Sec. 22. We may now turn for a moment to the con- 
sideration of a highly complex conceptual system which 
developes as the result of the experience of multitudinous 
percepts, in which conceptual system we recognize these per- 
cepts as subjective and set over against, and as representative 
of, real objects in an outer world. 
These real objects in an outer world are notably real objects 
which have spatial attributes but they are not sensationally 
qualified, and are not necessarily appreciated as affecting me ; 
the presentations related to them are thus not percepts, but 
are complex concepts which involve the existence of a broad 
outer-world conceptual system. 
As we have said above this outer world conceptual system 
is set over against the percepts which give it birth, these latter 
being conceived of as less stable than the conceptual “‘ object 
in the outer world,” which is conceived of as existing through 
the past perceiving, and the present perceiving, and the future 
perceiving, or even in those moments when there is no per- 
ceiving. In all cases of self-consciousness, as we have seen, 
the less stable parts of complex presentations tend to attach 
themselves to the empirical ego ; in the case here considered 
therefore the stable conceived “‘ object in the outer world” is 
1 As we have’seen in Appendix A, sec. 25. It cannot be held that 
percepts are what they are because of their social connotations. As Boris 
Sidis well says (Psychological Review, xv. 2, p. 119): “The percept is not 
experienced as external, because it is common to other people. We do 
not see the tree yonder, because other people can see it too; we 
would see it there even if, like Robinson Crusoe, we had no fellow- 
being to compare notes with. A hallucination is as fully a percept, 
and is perceived in the full garb of external reality, although it may 
have no currency with my fellow-men. The percept possesses the 
co-efficient of external reality, no matter whether or no others can 
share in it.”
-P-A-G-E-593
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 581 
par excellence objective ; and on the other hand the less stable 
percept as remembered, or experienced now, or expected, is 
attached to the empirical ego, i.e. is thought of as subjective. 
We not infrequently overlook the true nature of this 
conceptual world because we are unable to reflect upon the 
nature of percepts without discovering that they carry with 
them, as a connotation, this outer world conceptual aspect 
which leads us to conceive of the outer-world objects which 
appear to arouse them as persisting whether the percept exists 
ornot. Furthermore this outer world as a whole is conceived 
as persisting through all those less real presentations which 
were perceptual in my past, or are now perceptual, or which 
may be perceptual in the future. So parts of it are conceived 
to exist when there is no possibility of their perception, but 
where their perception might be possible were conditions 
changed (e.g. the opposite side of the moon). And it must 
be noted that all of these conceptions are appreciated in reflec- 
tion as necessarily implicated with our experience of percepts. 
It is by an extension of this reflective process that we reach 
the conception of the ‘‘ ding an sich,” and of Realities, which 
are not perceived, and which may even be conceived of as not 
within the realm of possible perception ; but which neverthe- 
less are appreciated as relatively stable in relation to our 
actually present, or remembered, or expected, percepts. 
Sec. 23. The fact that percepts involve realness for me 
naturally leads to a further conceptual connotation of these 
conceived realities, which are thought of as bearing the same 
relation to other men that they bear to me. And this con- 
notation is so firmly involved with the general body of our 
percepts that the realities conceived of as their basis are some- 
what generally assumed to be what they are because of their 
relations with the empirical ego of the percipient, together 
with their imagined relations with the empirical egos of other 
percipients. That this assumption is made by the common 
man is clear in the fact that he hesitates to accept the existence:
-P-A-G-E-594
562. THE SELF 
of these realities if he finds that he alone experiences the 
percept with which the reality is implicated. 
This fact as we have seen has led a number of men of high 
authority to hold that the recognition of an outer world reality 
is necessarily bound up with the appreciation of social rela- 
tions: a view which does not seem to me to be warranted. 
I conceive of the existence in space of cold dead suns, and if I 
alone of all men had attained the stage of mental develop- 
ment in which this conception is possible I might well believe 
in the existence of these suns even if no other man was living, 
or ever had lived. It is true that if doubt is raised as to the 
existence of these suns I naturally ask for corroboration in 
the concepts of other men ; and it is also true that I conceive 
myself as so constituted that I might under other conditions 
perceive these suns of whose existence I conceive: but this 
permanent possibility of perception serves merely to make 
firmer in retrospect my belief in the reliability of my con- 
ception of the object in the outer world as originally given. 
In such cases I imagine myself,—and usually this is easily 
observable,—in a position to experience a percept of the con- 
ceived object, and as experiencing it, and as believing in the 
existence of the object I would then perceive ; and this quite 
apart from any corroboration of any other possible perceivers 
than myself. 
C anpj D. Tue EmprricaL Eco anp THE SELF As 
RELATED WITH THE ALGEDONIC AND Time QUALITIES 
Sec. 24. The reader of Book 1m. may have noted that 
while we have held that we could never properly overlook the 
influence of the psychic system as this becomes explicit in the 
empirical ego, there was a difference between our treatment 
of this influence in relation to intensity and realness which we 
have again considered in the sections preceding this, and our
-P-A-G-E-595
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 583 
treatment of this influence in relation to pleasure-pain and 
the time quality. 
In relation to intensity and realness we have shown the 
evidence of the influence of the psychic system as displayed in 
what appears as a creative activity, if we may so speak: the 
psychic system as explicit in the empirical ego is experienced 
as forcing attention and as producing objectivity, as we have 
just seen. But the same cannot be said in relation to the 
algedonic and the time qualities. We cannot say that we 
appreciate the empirical ego as active in the production of a 
definite time phase : the most we can say is that a definite time 
phase becomes attached to and bound up with the empirical 
ego, making the presentation appear familiar, or anticipatory, 
as the case may be; and that the empirical ego is active in 
being thus bound up. Nor can we say that we appreciate the 
empirical ego as active in the production of a pleasure or a 
pain ; the most we can say is that a pleasure or a pain becomes 
especially linked with the empirical ego; and that, if a 
pleasure or a pain is once given, the empirical ego clings to 
the pleasure and revolts from the pain. 
This marked distinction which at first seems baffling is in 
the end found to be corroborative of our general positions. 
If the empirical ego is of the same nature as, and reciprocally 
efficient with, the object related to the empirical ego, its 
efficiency can only be shown by the emphasis of certain 
assimilable elements in the object: and such efficiency would 
give us such influences upon intensity in attention, and upon 
stability or realness in objectivity, as have been discovered, 
because both intensity and realness are bound up with the 
mere existence of specific emphases in the presentations to 
which they attach. 
But if our hypotheses are correct neither the algedonic 
quality nor the time quality can be thus related to the em- 
phases as mere existents. Pleasure and pain are phases of a 
quality determined by capacity, which is due to past condi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-596
584 THE SELF 
tions and is not wholly determined by the inner nature of the 
emphases, as is the case with intensity and realness: hence it 
is that while pleasure and pain bear close relation to the 
empirical ego, this empirical ego cannot directly enforce or 
minimize either of them except as it enforces or minimizes 
intensity and realness in relation to them. In like manner, 
if the time quality of a presentation is determined as we have 
suggested by relations of complexity which are determined. 
by conditions extrinsic to the presentation as it appears, then 
its phases are only very indirectly determined by the inner 
nature of the emphases which give attention and objective- 
ness: hence it is that, while the time phases of presentations 
bear close relation to the empirical ego, this empirical ego is 
not appreciated as creating a time phase in connection with a 
presentation except as it enforces the attention upon this time 
phase, or makes it objectively real for me. 
It is apparent therefore that we cannot expect to show the 
reciprocal efficiency existing between the Self and the em- 
pirical ego, and the algedonic or the time qualities, in as clear 
a way as we have done in relation to intensity and realness ; 
it may nevertheless be interesting to consider briefly the effect 
which the several phases of these qualities as experienced in 
connection with objects have upon the empirical ego, and 
what effect the empirical ego has upon objects thus qualified ; 
and less directly the reciprocal influences of the Self and its 
presentations as thus qualified. 
C. Tue Emprricat Eco anp THE Seir as RELATED WITH 
THE ALGEDONIC QuALITY 
I. The Effect upon the Empirical Ego and the Self 
Sec.25. That pleasant and painful objects very clearly 
transform the empirical ego is it seems to me as clear as any-
-P-A-G-E-597
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 585 
thing can be in introspection. If I am living in a world of 
pleasant experiences my empirical ego as a cheerful joyous 
man is surely a quite diverse entity from that which exists 
when I am living in a world of painful experiences and am 
depressed and sorrowful. 
Objective observation makes the same fact clear in relation 
to the Self. If we may judge from the reactions of the indi- 
vidual man to whom we offer the joys of life, when he is 
entirely non-self-conscious, his Self is clearly diverse from the 
Self of the same physical individual to whom we bring dis- 
appointment, or care, or woe. 
Evidently such differences of reaction upon the empirical 
ego and the Self by the pleasures and pains of life should be 
expected under our views ; for the pleasant objective presen- 
tations involve neururgic conditions which tend to persist, 
while the painful objective presentations involve neururgic 
conditions which tend to disappear ; markedly pleasant objects 
will therefore have more hold than painful ones upon their co- 
existent the empirical ego; and markedly pleasant presenta- 
tions more hold upon the Self than painful ones. Pleasures 
then on the one hand will tend to transform the empirical ego 
and the Self in the direction of a greater breadth, as in joyful- 
ness ; while pains will tend to narrow and restrict the empirical 
ego and the Self, as in depression of spirits. 
This will of course be distinctly marked only in relation to 
the clearly presented empirical ego ; and that what are appreci- 
ated to be pleasant objects related to the empirical ego, (when 
both are experienced as parts of a complex presentation to the 
Self in self-conscious states) do result in an expansive attitude 
of the empirical ego is clear from the general experience of 
mankind ; so marked indeed is this experience that it has led 
not a few writers to speak as though this transformation of the 
empirical ego were of the very essence of pleasure itself. 
That painful objects related to the empirical ego on the other 
hand do result in what appears in relation to the result of 
   
-P-A-G-E-598
    586 THE SELF 
pleasant experience as a narrowing of the ‘‘feel” of the em- 
pirical ego is equally clear, as is seen in the fact that the same 
writers have not hesitated to hold that this narrowing of the 
empirical ego is of the very essence of pain itself. 
This experience of the narrowing of the empirical ego in 
the presence of painful objects, and of its expansion in the 
presence of pleasant objects, is interesting in connection with 
our theory as to the relation of the empirical ego and the Self. 
For if the empirical ego is narrowed it must be by absorption 
into a somewhat like itself which is not presented, and if it is 
expanded in like manner it must gain from this same non- 
presented somewhat of like nature with itself. 
Now what was the Self before the pleasant presentation was 
given must be aroused during the pleasant experience to 
higher efficiency ; and under such conditions certain of its 
elements will be likely to be split off, as it were, i.e. to become 
part of the presentation. If the presentation is one of self- 
consciousness this split off part of the Self will be likely to 
become attached to the empirical ego, if the empirical ego is 
of a systemic nature analogous to the Self. This would aid 
in the emphasis of that sense of expansion in the “‘ feel” of 
the empirical ego under the experience of pleasure of which 
we have spoken above. 
On the other hand what, under our theory, was the Self 
before a painful presentation was given, will be in general 
reduced in its efficiency during the painful experience, and 
into its undifferentiable non-presentable mass will be absorbed 
certain of the elements which before the moment of painful- 
ness were part of the presentation. _ If the presentation is one 
of self-consciousness the absorption will be likely to be from 
the empirical ego. This would aid in the emphasis of that 
sense of restriction in the ‘‘feel” of the empirical ego of 
which we have also spoken above.
-P-A-G-E-599
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 587 
II. The Effects of the Empirical Ego and of the Self 
Sec. 26. We turn thus naturally to the consideration of 
the reaction of the empirical ego upon those of its objects 
which are pleasant and upon those which are painful ; and of 
the Self upon presentations respectively pleasant and painful. 
Under the hypothesis maintained in earlier chapters an 
object related to the empirical ego is pleasant when the 
activity of its special corresponding neural element or ele- 
ments involves the use of surplus stored energy. Other 
things being equal, this involves a spontaneous continuation 
of activity of the neural element or part ; and, as the result of 
this, a tendency to the production of a higher general activity 
in the complex neural system as a whole, part of which com- 
plex system is the whole broad minor system corresponding 
with the partial presentation which we call the empirical ego. 
Under the influence of a pleasant objective presentation 
therefore the constitution of the minor neururgic system 
which corresponds with the empirical ego is bound to be 
broadened, and elements within it as thus broadened to be 
raised to a higher grade of activity. Under such conditions 
the neururgic increment which involves a high grade of 
activity in a part of the whole system is more likely to act in 
harmony with some active elements of the minor system which 
is the correspondent of the empirical ego, to be assimilated by 
it, than would be the case if this minor system’s activity were 
not increased by the fact that its increment induces a trans- 
formation of energy from a potential to a kinetic form. 
We should naturally expect therefore, in the first place, to 
experience, in connection with a pleasant object in self-con- 
sciousness, a sense of expansion in connection with the 
empirical ego ; and this we have seen in the preceding section 
is the case. In the second place we should expect to note 
that the empirical ego spontaneously acts to sustain the 
pleasant object in attention, and this is also clearly a matter of
-P-A-G-E-600
  
  588 THE SELF 
every day experience. We choose to cling to pleasures, and 
to act in special ways to continue the pleasant experiences. 
Sec. 27. Under the hypothesis referred to in the previous 
section an object related to the empirical ego is painful if the 
activity of its special corresponding neural elements is forced 
upon it by stimuli! to which it is unable to react spontane- 
ously. Other things being equal this involves a tendency of 
these elements to desist from their activity, and a failure of 
complete answer to the stimulus which is producing the pain- 
ful presentation. These conditions in themselves evidently 
involve no tendency, such as we find where the presentation 
is pleasant, to a heightened activity of the whole neururgic 
minor system which is coincident with the empirical ego: on 
the contrary they involve what is equivalent to a relative loss 
of energy within the neururgic system as a whole. Under 
the influence of a painful object therefore the constitution of 
the minor system which corresponds with the empirical ego is 
bound to be narrowed in relation to what it would be were the 
object a pleasant one; and elements within it are less likely 
than under other conditions to appear as acting in harmony 
with the elements emphasized by the presence of the painful 
object. 
We should naturally expect therefore, in the first place, to 
experience, in connection with a painful object in self-con- 
sciousness, a sense of the narrowing of the empirical ego; 
and that this is the case we have seen above. But in the 
second place we should expect to note that the empirical ego 
fails in general to sustain the painful object in attention, and 
that this is in accord with experience is also very clear. 
Nothing can be more certain than that we (our empirical egos) 
have no welcome to give to painful objects. 
Sec. 28. But evidently we go beyond the mere colorless 
1 The reader will, of course, see that the word “stimuli” is here used in 
its widest sense, and does not refer exclusively to those which reach the 
system from its environment.
-P-A-G-E-601
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 589 
warmth toward pleasant, and coldness toward painful, objec- 
tive presentations. Evidently the mere tendency to the 
assimilation of a pleasant object by the empirical ego as above 
described is greatly emphasized in our complex life by pro- 
cesses which should be looked for in connection with the 
nature of organic development as we understand it. The 
general ebullition of activity within the neural system which 
accompanies pleasure is turned by nature’s processes into 
special channels, and is made use of by her to induce con- 
tinuance of the processes which occasion the pleasure: for 
organisms which as a whole act in a manner to welcome the 
effective activities which involve pleasure will on the whole 
tend to survive, and thus pleasures have in general become 
attached to activities which have been, or still are, conducive 
to organic well being. Those organisms therefore which 
tend to act in a manner which will emphasize and continue 
pleasant rather than painful elemental activities will be the 
more efficient as the result of this emphasis and continuance. 
It is possible thus with Mr. Spencer to describe pleasure as 
“‘a feeling which we seek to bring into consciousness and #0 
retain there.” It is the Self as explicit in the empirical ego 
that by its influence tends first to emphasize the pleasure 
which comes to us in itself ; and then, as the result of com- 
plex collateral reactions, which have become fixed in us by 
the processes of development, tends to emphasize all sorts of 
activities which bring into existence, or continue the existence 
of, conditions which have part in bringing to us the pleasure, 
or continuing it in our experience. 
‘The vigorous rejection of pain by the empirical ego in 
like manner is not adequately explained unless we bear in 
mind the enormous complexity of our neururgic systems, 
and of the nature of organic development as we understand 
_it; for we perceive that the painful objective presentation 
could not appear in attention at all if its neural coincident 
were not compelled to an emphatic, even if impeded, activity 
 
-P-A-G-E-602
590 THE SELF 
by the stimulus reaching it. Impeded though it be, the 
painful object therefore involves a relatively narrow ebulli- 
tion of activity induced by the object which the system as a 
whole tends to reject and minimize. But Nature here steps 
in and as it were says to herself, “‘ pains have become attached. 
in general to processes which are disadvantageous, because 
the activities coincident with painful presentations tend to 
desist, and only those individuals which tend not to welcome 
disadvantageous processes can survive. The organisms which 
will tend not only to fail to welcome, but to actively reject, 
pains will on the whole be still better fitted to survive. Now 
here are certain activities forced upon the system by stimuli, 
even though the system does not welcome them. As these 
activities exist for the time being I may well use them for 
all they are worth to help the organism to cut off the stimuli 
which are causing the pain, and to minimize the effects of 
the stimuli if it cannot cut them off.” Hence it is that we 
find the most violent reactions of the system given to the 
rejection of pain, which we may well describe in Mr. Spencer’s 
words as ‘‘a feeling which we seek to get out of consciousness, 
and to keep out.” It is the Self as explicit in the empirical 
ego that tends first to minimize the pain; and then to 
emphasize certain activities which tend to frustrate actions, 
or to change conditions, which have to do with bringing pain 
to us, or continuing it. 
Sec. 29. When we consider specifically the influence of 
the Self upon pleasant or upon painful presentations, we find, 
quite apart from states in which we are self-conscious, some 
influence from somewhere, and which under our theory is 
from the Self, emphasizing and welcoming the pleasant, and 
rejecting the painful. The pleasures seem natural and our 
own. The pains seem unnatural and intrusive. The Self 
appears to appropriate the pleasures, it rejects the pains. It 
is this fact which leads us in our life of thought to the state- 
ment of the “problem of pain”; for pain does not seem
-P-A-G-E-603
EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 591 
to belong to us, and this leads us to inquire why it is with 
us. But as we have already noted there is no problem of 
pleasure ; no one stops to ask why pleasure is with us, because 
he appreciates it as his own by right. His Self, his whole 
psychic system, welcomes and grasps and assimilates it ; just 
as it rejects and fails to assimilate what is painful. 
Here again then, when we are not self-conscious, when we 
are attending only to the pleasures and to the pains as such, 
we find this influence upon the pleasant and painful presenta- 
tions from the Self exactly correspondent with the influence 
which, when we are self-conscious, we recognize as exerted 
by the empirical ego upon its objects respectively pleasant 
and painful. 
Sec. 30. If what men call “‘ feeling” is the empirical ego 
not yet explicit we should expect to note that pleasant and 
painful objects induce diverse phases of this ‘‘ feeling,” which 
I think will be granted. We should expect also to note, as 
we do, that what we describe as ‘‘ feeling” displays a welcom- 
ing aspect towards a pleasant presentation and an averseness 
towards a painful one. We are not surprised furthermore 
to discover that if we consider these attitudes of ‘‘feeling” 
in themselves we find it very difficult to avoid our reference 
of them to a distinct empirical ego. 
D. Tue Emprreicat Eco anp THE SELF as RELATED 
witH THE Time QuaLity 
I. The Effect upon the Empirical Ego and the Self 
Sec. 31. In order to complete our survey we must ask 
whether we find evidence of such a relation between the 
efficiency of the empirical ego and the time quality of objects, 
and between the efficiency of the Self and the time quality of 
presentations, as we would be led to look for if our tentative
-P-A-G-E-604
  592 THE SELF 
theory as to the nature of the time experience as given in 
Book 11. is well grounded. 
If our notions are valid it would seem that a presentation 
which has the quality of pastness, and in that fact under our 
hypothesis displays a simplification of complexity, should in 
general show less tendency to arouse a sense of the efficiency 
of the broad minor psychic system which we call the empirical 
ego, than a presentation displaying presentness, where no 
change of complexity occurs ; and still less than a presentation 
displaying the quality of futureness, in consideration of the 
increase of complexity with which this futureness is related. 
Sec. 32. If we are to compare the effects of the differences 
of time phase upon the empirical ego we must establish an 
equality of vividness in attention between the presentations 
whose time qualities are compared. A presentation involv- 
ing presentness is wont to be too vivid to allow either those 
which display pastness or futureness to arise in comparison 
with it: but where such a presentation is less vivid we often- 
times find possible such a comparison as we have spoken of 
above between the state of an empirical ego in contrast with 
an object involving presentness, and that of an empirical ego 
in contrast with an object having the quality of pastness. 
In such cases I think it is clear to introspection that I, as I 
consider myself in self-consciousness, am more alert in rela- 
tion to objects in attention which are appreciated as present 
than to those which are appreciated as past: and this differ- 
ence of alertness means a difference in the nature of the 
empirical ego. 
Nevertheless that the empirical ego is necessarily closely 
bound up with the pastness phase of the objects in attention 
is clearly shown in the fact that memory is, as we have seen, 
determined by a recognition of the attachment of the real 
past presentations to the empirical ego.’ 
Jas. Mill, it will be recalled, held that memory proper includes the 
Tepresentation of one’s past self as agent or patient in the event or
-P-A-G-E-605
  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 593 
Sec. 33. If in like manner we use care to consider cases 
where there is an equalization of vividness between objects 
which involve presentness, and those which display future- 
ness, we seem to note that in the latter case (that of futureness) 
the empirical ego is distinctly more alert, more active, than 
in the former case (that of presentness) ; and this we should 
expect if our theories are correct. ‘This consideration clearly 
indicates that the time phase of the object effects a difference 
in the constitution of the empirical ego in these several cases. 
Sec. 34. The specific modification of the Self by the past- 
ness, or futureness, or by the absence of both in presentness, 
of the presentations given to it, can of course be known only 
from objective evidence. But the man as viewed objectively 
appears to display, when he is entirely lacking in self-con- 
sciousness, just such special modifications of his Self in the 
presence of presentations which have pastness, or futureness, 
or which are distinguished as present, as we have noted in 
his empirical ego when he is clearly self-conscious, and when 
the pastness, or presentness, or futureness are attached to 
objects related to this empirical ego. 
Il. The Effect of the Empirical Ego and of the Self 
Sec. 35. When we turn to consider the difference of 
reaction of the empirical ego upon those of its objects which 
have pastness, and those which have futureness, and those 
which involve the notion of presentness, we discover very 
marked distinctions between this influence in the several 
cases, of which we have incidentally spoken above. 
Objective presentations which have pastness, i.e. which 
situation recalled. But this would seem to be going too far. All that 
we can certainly maintain is that memory proper is bound up with this 
moment’s empirical ego. For Dr. James Ward is certainly justified in 
objecting that whereas “memory is essential to any development of 
self-consciousness the converse is not at all clear, and would involve us 
in a needless circle.”

  594 THE SELF 
under our hypothesis involve a simplifying complexity, are 
thought of in the main as irrevocable, they appear to float 
before the mind in a stream for the most part almost unin- 
fluenced by any action of the empirical ego ; and this is what 
we should expect to note if what has been said in the previous 
section is correct. For the simplification involved with past- 
ness involves a reduction of the hold upon the manifold 
empirical ego. As soon as the objects are influenced by the 
empirical ego they are appreciated as having in them some- 
thing of presentness. We may still speak of them as past, 
but we feel that we are modifying them for our service in 
the practical life of the present. 
That objective presentations which display what we call 
presentness appear in our experience as constantly modified 
by the empirical ego is clear. Those however which are 
qualified by futureness, those in other words which under our 
hypothesis involve developing complexity, are, as we should 
expect them to be, the objects upon which the effect of the 
empirical ego is most marked. These objects are constantly 
“budding,” to again use Prof. James’ term: they are con- 
stantly developing new psychic elements upon which the 
empirical ego may lay hold, and which it may emphasize. 
This would lead us to expect that clear appreciation of the 
efficiency of the empirical ego would be bound up with the 
emphasis of the futureness in the object affected; and that 
this is a matter of common experience is attested by the fact 
that in all attention, and in all volition as involving attention, 
there is a prospective reference, as is agreed by all psycho- 
logists.1_ While we appreciate that we are to some extent 
in control of the present as we are not of the past, we have 
still greater confidence that the future is far from irrevocable 
and that to a great extent we may mould it.

  EGO AND SELF AND GENERAL QUALITIES 595 
its objects which display pastness, or presentness, or future- 
ness, have their exact parallel in the diverse reactions of the 
Self upon its presentations which display pastness, or present- 
ness, or futureness. This is clear from purely objective 
evidence, and from such introspective evidence as we are able 
to gather from comparison of the modifications of non-self- 
conscious presentations with the modifications of what are 
recognized to be objects related to the empirical ego in self- 
consciousness. ‘The man whom we watch, and who is so 
vividly affected by his presentations that no state of self-con- 
sciousness can exist in him, acts upon a presentation which 
displays pastness, or presentness, or futureness, exactly as he 
does when we know he is fully self-conscious, and recognizes 
the diverse actions of his empirical ego, in the several cases, 
upon its objects which display the corresponding temporal 
characteristics. 
Sec. 37. As we have already seen above, certain very 
marked special forms are given to presentations in which 
pastness and futureness are distinctly developed, by the appre- 
ciation of their close relation with the empirical ego; an 
appreciation which transforms familiarity into memory, and 
anticipation into expectation. 
Sec. 38. If what men call ‘‘feeling” is of the same nature 
as the empirical ego, as we have suggested, then we should 
expect to note, as we certainly do, that ‘‘ feeling”! is aroused 
less by what we consider past and gone, than by what is here 
now ; and aroused less by what we look upon as present than 
by what we hope for, or dread, or expect, in the future. 
We should also expect to note that the reaction of ‘‘feel- 
ing,” the “‘feeling attitude” so called, is less marked in 
relation to pastness than to presentness or futureness ; and 
this is surely the case. 
1It must again be noted that we do not here refer to emotional states, 
which are often called feelings.

  CHAPTER XXVI 
THE MUTABILITY OF THE EMPIRICAL EGO AND OF 
THE SELF 
I. Tue Mutasiriry or THE Emprricat Eco 
Sec. 1. Tue reader will recall that in Book 1. we have 
seen that each noetic pattern is new and unique, and that each 
complex presentation within each noetic pattern is a new and 
unique presentation ; this conclusion not being inconsistent 
with the fact that in retrospect the representatives of succes- 
sive presentations may be so closely identified that they are 
spoken of as ‘‘the same.” Evidently then if it is true, as 
we have seen, that the empirical ego is a complex presentation 
of a special form, it follows that the empirical ego of each 
moment is a new and unique empirical ego: + and this not- 
withstanding that in retrospect the representatives of succes- 
sive empirical egos may be so closely identified that they will 
be spoken of as “the same.” This may seem to some reader 
1The reader, I trust, will not imagine that I overlook the recognition 
by earlier writers, especially by Hume for instance, of the fact that the 
ego of self-consciousness is a new and unique existent in each moment; 
but inasmuch as their teachings in this respect have not been taken 
with sufficient seriousness, and as our method of approach and our 
object in entering into this discussion are quite diverse from those of 
the writers to whom I might refer, the reader will understand why the 
questions involved are here treated with few references to the work of 
others.
-P-A-G-E-609
MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 597 
a hard saying ; and it may be well therefore to recall briefly 
our considerations of Chapter v. 
Sec. 2. Considering in the first place the nature of presen- 
tations in general we may note with Bosanquet’ that “each 
moment of consciousness is full of a given complex of presen- 
tation, which passes away and can never be repeated without 
some difference.” And again with Prof. James,’ that ‘‘ no 
state once gone can recur and be identical with what it was 
before.” ‘‘ Every thought we have of a given fact is, strictly 
speaking, unique, and only bears a resemblance of kind with 
our other thoughts of the same fact.”* I think that all 
psychologists will agree that these statements are sound :* 
and this means that the emphatic part of each noetic pattern 
is in all cases new and unique. 
Quite apart from introspection it is apparent that this must 
be true, if it is true that these emphatic parts of noetic patterns 
correspond with neururgic emphases: for as Prof. James 
says,’ “ Whilst we think our brain changes, and like the 
aurora borealis its whole internal equilibrium shifts with every 
pulse of change. The precise nature of the shifting at a 
given moment is the product of many factors. . . . But just 
as one of them certainly is the influence of outward objects 
on the sense organs during the moment, so is another certainly 
the very special susceptibility in which the organ has been 
left at that moment by all it has gone through in the past. 
Every brain state is partly determined by the nature of this 
entire past succession. It is out of the question then that 
any total brain-state should identically recur. Something 
like it may recur; but to suppose it to recur would be 
equivalent to the absurd admission that all the states that 
had intervened between its two appearances had been pure

598 THE SELF 
nonentities, and that the organ after their passage was exactly 
what it was before.” 
Sec. 3. Let us turn now to the more specific consideration 
of the presented ego. 
A. Under the theory here examined each consciousness is 
a system of mentalities which has as its coincident a system 
of neural activities which we have agreed to call a neururgic 
system. Where such a neururgic system becomes complex, it 
is discovered to be a system of minor neururgic systems, and 
this system of systems as developed in man is of enormous 
intricacy. In such a complex system of neururgic systems, 
minor systems are developed which are more or less com- 
pletely disparate. These diverse minor systems themselves 
are more or less complex, and the elements composing them 
may be more or less differentiable as the grades of activity 
of these elements vary. 
Such diverse minor systems may under certain conditions 
be called into activity as wholes, usually as the result of 
systematized stimulations of diverse nature which we may 
speak of as stimulative systems. The more complex are the 
stimulative systems and the neural minor systems which are 
called upon to react thereto, the less probable will it be that 
any one complex minor neururgic system as a whole will be 
persistently and continuously aroused to emphatic activity. 
It is true that, if the general conditions of stimulation are 
relatively stable, what is practically one specific minor neur- 
urgic system, which changes little, may be, and will be likely 
to be, persistently called as a whole into activity. But this 
cannot be thought of as being in two successive moments 
exactly the same minor neururgic system unmodified, if the 
stimulative system varies in these two moments as it usually 
does, nor even if the stimulative system does not appear to 
vary; for in this latter case the effects of reaction in one 
moment must result in modifications within the neururgic 
system of the next moment even though the stimulative 
 
-P-A-G-E-611
  MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 599 
system be practically unaltered. If the two neururgic sys- 
tems of two successive moments appear to be the same it is 
not because they really are exactly the same, but because they 
appear in reflection to be but slightly diverse. 
a. Now under our hypothesis the empirical ego of any 
moment is conceived of as the psychic coincident of such a 
highly complex minor neururgic system as we have been 
above describing,—a minor neururgic system within a vast 
system of neururgic systems,—which is emphasized as a 
whole because the elementary parts of the minor system are 
in themselves so well coordinated that the system cannot be 
raised into prominence except as an undifferentiable whole. 
It appears therefore that an empirical ego may be practically 
unchanged from moment to moment ; and may in reflection 
appear to be persistent as unchanged in successive moments 
provided the stimulative system which arouses it does not 
change in any important particular in these successive 
moments. This is the condition of the ordinary experience 
of man as he views in retrospect his successive empirical egos 
of states of self-consciousness. 
But it is equally clear that this appearance of lack of change 
must be an illusion. For in the first place the empirical ego 
cannot remain unchanged from moment to moment if the 
nature of the stimulative system which leads to its emphasis 
changes in two successive moments, as it necessarily does in 
some particulars, and usually does in some noticeable degree. 
And in the second place even if the stimulative system is 
conceived to remain the same from moment to moment, which 
can seldom be the case, the neururgic system with which the 
empirical ego corresponds cannot be conceived to remain 
unmodified if it is affected by successive stimulations. 
In other words the empirical ego, being the psychic coinci- 
dent of an undifferentiable mass of nervous activities which 
is emphasized as a whole, must vary from moment to 
moment just as these nervous activities vary from moment
-P-A-G-E-612
600 THE SELF 
to moment :—and as these activities must be of new and 
unique form in each successive moment, so the empirical ego 
must in each successive moment be a new and unique 
empirical ego. 
Sec. 4. It may be well perhaps to present the facts before 
us in terms of symbols similar to those used in a previous 
chapter (Chapter 11.) according to which the whole complex 
state of self-consciousness may be represented by Fig. 9 
below,

in which the undarkened small o’s as a whole represent the 
non-presentable Self ; in which the large O represents the 
object contrasted with the empirical ego ; while this empirical

Evidently if Fig. 10 represents the presentation which we 
call tne empirical ego, it will be differentiated if any one of 
the psychicelements within it is properly reduced in emphasis, 
and this would be represented by replacing one of the
-P-A-G-E-613
MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 601 
darkened small 0’s in Fig. 9 by a light small o: this meaning 
that the particular psychic element in question had lost its 
position as a partial presentation, and had become part of the 
non-presentable Self. In an opposite manner the empirical 
ego represented in Fig. ro will be differentiated if any one 
of the closely related psychic elements within the non-present- 
able Self is sufficiently increased in emphasis ; and this would 
be represented by replacing one of the light small os in Fig. 9 
by a darkened small o. 
We might thus find the state of self-consciousness symbo- 
lized, not as in Fig. 9, but as in Fig. rr below, 
in which case the empirical ego would be symbolized, not as 
in Fig. 10, but as in Fig. 12 below.

Here the differences in the two states of self-consciousness 
would not lie in the object O as related to either empirical 
ego, but in the nature of the empirical egos symbolized by 
Figs. 10 and 12.
-P-A-G-E-614
  602 THE SELF 
It might well be that the diverse empirical egos thus con- 
sidered might have elements which in reflection appear to be 
identical, as certain of the darkened o’s in Figs. 10 and 12 
are common to both symbols. Thus we may represent the 
identities which in reflection lead us to think of what we may 
speak of as an empirical ego continuum. 
Sec. 5. When one turns to introspection for evidence of 
this mutability of the empirical ego he is likely at first to 
question the truth of the statement, for if there is any one 
thing that seems clear to the plain man, and to us in our 
usual moods, it is that our every day selves are persistent 
enduring entities. 
It appears evident however upon further consideration that 
there are morbid cases in which a mutability of egohood is 
clearly evidenced ; and if we study these cases we find them 
shading off into others which appear more nearly normal, 
until finally we become convinced that our own empirical egos 
are not so fully stable as we are wont to imagine them. In 
this connection we may well turn our thought again for a 
moment to the consideration of the hypothetical neururgic 
basis of the presented empirical egos. 
Sec. 6. A. The active nervous system as we have seen is 
composed of more or less closely related, and more or less 
complex, systems of minor neururgic systems, some of which 
act as unified wholes when stimulated by what we have spoken 
of as unified stimulative systems. 
So great is the complexity of the nervous system that two 
or more diverse neururgic minor systems of this type may 
be simultaneously stimulated to activity as wholes by one 
and the same complex stimulation ; and then these diverse 
minor systems will contend with one another for dominance. 
Under such conditions although at any one moment one of 
these minor systems will tend to become predominant, yet 
the predominance may rapidly shift from one to another minor 
system, and we may have before us an appearance of two or
-P-A-G-E-615
  MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 603 
more predominant minor neururgic systems co-existing within 
the same great system of systems. 
Usually however noticeable variation of stimulative con- 
ditions will be needed to call into prominence the disparate 
minor neururgic systems ; and in such cases the shifting from 
the predominance of the one to the predominance of the other 
will be less rapid, so that we may often be able to note the 
predominance of one minor system at one time and under 
one set of conditions, and of another minor system at another 
time and under another set of conditions. 
a. Now under our hypothesis any special empirical ego 
when it appears as a presentation is the correspondent of sucha 
complex system of undifferentiable neururgic parts which is 
emphasized as a whole: and if this is true then to such 
diverse, and more or less exclusive, minor neururgic systems 
as we have above described there should correspond diverse 
empirical egos. And if we are justified in our contentions 
we should be able to recognize in every day life the diversity 
of these empirical egos; although in certain cases it might 
be expected that this diversity would be overlooked and 
scarcely noticeable even under careful introspection. At 
times however diverse empirical egos might be expected to 
appear to contend for mastery ; while at other times where 
the minor systems involved are altogether lacking in common 
elements, they might be expected to appear as thoroughly 
diverse and disparate and entirely separated from one another. 
‘What we have just said may become clearer if we refer 
again to the symbolization given in Sec. 43 according to 
which it would appear that in many cases these diverse 
empirical egos might so far overlap, i.e. might have so many 
common elements, that when considered together in reflection 
their differences might be overlooked (as represented in Figs. 
g and 11 above). And furthermore if this diversity were 
marked, yet not complete, more than one empirical ego might 
appear in experience at one and the same moment. This
-P-A-G-E-616
604. THE SELF 
would be symbolized by something like a combination of 
Figs. 9 and 11 as in Fig. 13 below. 
Beyond this it would appear that in other cases these diverse 
empirical egos might be so far disassociated as to appear quite 
diverse in reflection. And again if this diversity between 
the empirical egos were very marked, and so complete that 
the complex minor psychic systems involved were quite dis- 
associated, then it might well be that the object contrasted 
with the one empirical ego could never appear as a revival in 
the field of attention when the other empirical ego became 
prominent in attention. 
Sec. 7. When we ask ourselves whether such empirical 
egos are observable in our experience objective and intro- 
spective, we find it well to consider the cases referred to in 
the preceding section in reverse order, for evidently the em- 
pirical egos which are most diverse in their characteristics, if 
such exist, will be most readily noted by us in introspection 
and by objective signs. 
We are here evidently led to the consideration of the 
phenomena of multiple personality, which have been made so 
familiar to the reader by modern psychiatrists, and which 
receive so clear an elucidation in, or at all events in an exten- 
sion of, the “‘ disaggregation” theory of Prof. Pierre Janet, 
and especially in the “‘ dissociation” theory of Morton Prince
-P-A-G-E-617
MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 605 
and Boris Sidis, with which on the whole the positions here 
maintained are in full accord. 
In what follows I shall ask the reader to note, not only that 
psychologists very generally explicitly or implicitly make the 
assumption of the existence of a multiplicity of empirical 
egos in connection with the activities of one human indi- 
vidual, but also that the common man in every day life 
implicitly makes this very same assumption. 
Cases of recognized ‘‘double personality” have become 
thoroughly familiar to the psychologist during the past 
twenty years; but nothing more convincing has been given 
to the world than the case of Miss Beauchamp studied in 
detail by Dr. Morton Prince in his ‘‘ Dissociation of a Per- 
sonality” ; a work which is of the utmost importance in this 
field ; and in which we deal, not with a mere doubleness of 
empirical egohood, but with multiple egohood: for all the 
diverse personalities that from time to time inhabit, so to 
speak, the body of the patient are thoroughly self-conscious, 
and are able to consider their nature and in a measure their 
relations with one another. Recognized double personalities, 
like that of Ansel Bourne mentioned by Prof. James in his 
Psychology, are perhaps more generally familiar +, cases where 
the disjunction is so complete that the two personalities are 
entirely unacquainted with one another; a situation which 
must be looked for if the general positions explained in this 
work are well taken. For it is clear that presentations that 
are utterly diverse cannot be subject to recall by the processes 
which are ordinarily described as associative: and therefore 
if empirical egos of an utterly diverse nature, being diverse 
presentations, do exist at different times in connection with 
the activities of one and the same human body, it will be 
impossible for the empirical ego of one moment to be recalled 
in the form necessary for comparison with the utterly diverse 
empirical ego of another moment, the noetic patterns in which 
the two empirical egos appear being utterly diverse. If 
 
-P-A-G-E-618
606 THE SELF 
therefore such utterly diverse empirical egos exist in one and 
the same individual man they will not be discovered by his 
introspective differentiation of them, but inferred only from 
purely objective evidence. 
But we do find objective evidence of the existence of just 
such diverse empirical egos in connection with the activities 
of the same human individual, who himself fails to recognize 
them introspectively, in the cases here referred to, which are 
observed not uncommonly in the insane, and at times in those 
who are ordinarily sane but who are under conditions of 
temporary mental derangement, and not infrequently in 
hysterical patients, and with practical invariability in those 
who are hypnotized. Here we have evidence of the exist- 
ence of diverse personalities at different times, each of which 
is described by the patient at the time of its existence exactly 
as each of two different men would portray his own empirical 
ego of the moment. 
Examples to illustrate this are perhaps unnecessary, but as 
typical we may refer to the cases of those who are subjected to 
the hypnotic trance. The hypnotic patient may be fully self- 
conscious, i.e. the empirical ego may be distinctly developed 
in his field of attention, as is evidenced by questioning him 
when in this abnormal state. He then however is often un- 
able to recall the episodes of his normal life; that is it is 
impossible to associate with the empirical ego of the abnormal 
moment occurrences which would associate easily with the 
empirical ego of normal life. When he awakens to normal life 
he in like manner is often unable to recall the episodes of the 
hypnotic trance ; that is it is then impossible to associate with 
the empirical ego of the normal moment occurrences which 
naturally associate themselves with the empirical ego of the 
hypnotic trance. 
Those who are familiar with the literature of trance pheno- 
mena, and of morbid mental life, will realize however, that 
such cases of complete disjunction are relatively rare. In a
-P-A-G-E-619
    MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 607 
large proportion of cases there is sufficient bond between the 
two diverse psychic systems to allow of some association 
between the two empirical egos. The empirical ego of one 
moment recalls something of the experience of the other ; and 
in a measure the empirical ego of the one state accepts the 
empirical ego of the other state as being more or less closely 
related to it, as is seen in the fact that suggestions made in one 
state are acted upon in the other.’ 
Sec. 8. We have thus stepped gradually to the ordinary 
conditions of self-consciousness : for a little thought will con- 
vince us that in normal life we are often able to recognize 
diversities of the empirical egos of separate moments, which 
at times are so disparate as to compel our attention to the 
disparateness, but which in the majority of cases are felt to be 
1Jt must be apparent to the reader that the acceptance of the existence 
of multiple empirical egos, in connection with the activities of what we 
look upon as one human individual, enables us to explain in terms of 
normal psychic activities a very large proportion of those phenomena which 
have been collected by the Society for Psychical Research. If in our every 
day life we experience different, yet closely allied, empirical egos which 
fuse together so completely that we do not stop to consider their differ- 
ences ; what wonder that we are startled by a shifting of our thought from 
one empirical egohood of a form with which we are familiar, to another 
which is of very diverse form and unfamiliar to us ;—what wonder that 
we are at times tempted to believe that the expressions of the empirical ego 
of unfamiliar form are the expressions of other individuals than those we 
are accustomed to call ourselves. 
Nor is it surprising to us, with our knowledge of the complex processes 
of organic development, that these empirical egos of unusual type should 
appear at times as survivals of conditions of existence long since passed 
away. ‘They may be like the empirical egos of men of low development, 
of rudimentary morality. They may be dwarfed, or deformed, or even 
mutilated, personalities so diverse from our normal empirical egos that we 
are unwilling to believe we are not temporarily “possessed,” by devils, 
if the distinction is very marked between the empirical ego which we 
for the moment experience and our normal empirical egos; or by the 
“spirits” of men whom we have known but who have died, when the 
distinction is less marked.

so far alike in their nature that we are commonly led to think 
of them as identical and the same. In fact I think the reader 
will find, as I find, not so much evidence of his body being 
dominated by dual, as of it being dominated by multiple 
personalities at different times. I am one person when I 
direct the conduct of constructional works; quite another 
when in church I listen to a dogmatic sermon. I am still 
another personality when I converse with deeply loved 
friends ; quite another when I discuss philosophical problems ; 
quite another when I am in the fields playing golf. 
These examples might be multiplied indefinitely were it 
worth while. The personalities differ in greater or less 
degree. In some cases it is not difficult to pass from one to 
the other ; in other cases it requires a real “‘ wrench” to pass 
from the state where the one personality is dominant to the 
state where the other is dominant. In extreme cases, as we 
have seen, the personalities are so divergent that the associa- 
tions attached to the one empirical ego cannot be attached to 
the other, and we find that the one personality is utterly un- 
able to recall the experiences which have been closely and 
intimately attached to the other. Those who have read thus 
far in this book will be ready to believe that it would be 
natural for me as a psychological personality, and in my 
ordinary social life, to drop anything I happened to be at 
work upon to meet and greet Prof. Wm. James if he were 
announced. Yet one morning in my studio, when I was 
immersed in business affairs, one of my clerks came to me and 
said “‘a Mr. James is in the outer office and asks to see you.” 
I said to myself ‘‘who can that be?” and then to my clerk 
“ask him to sit down and wait for a few moments,” and 
proceeded calmly for some little time with the dictation of a 
letter I had begun. When presently I went to the outer 
office I found to my chagrin that I had kept waiting a man 
whose friendship I highly cherish. To my architectural em- 
pirical ego the word James meant nothing at all; while to my 
 
-P-A-G-E-621
  MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 609 
psychological empirical ego it meant the quick response of a 
friend and admirer. 
Sec. 9. The multiplicity of the empirical egos which we 
commonly hold to be one and the same personality is also 
clearly brought into view when we consider the empirical egos 
of far separated times in the lives of perfectly normal men. 
When we say that the empirical ego of an hour ago and of this 
moment are the same, we are making a comparison of two 
empirical egos one of which is bound up with what we call the 
past, the other of which is in the ‘‘ specious present.” Where 
the past empirical ego is one lately experienced, say an hour 
ago, we seldom note much difference between the two that 
are compared. Where the past empirical ego is one of last 
year we note some difference, where it is one of ten or twenty 
years ago a marked difference. And when we reach mature 
years, and look back to the years of our youth or childhood, it 
must appear evident to any candid mind that the empirical ego 
_ of those joyous days of light heartedness was quite a different 
entity from the empirical ego of the present moment with 
which we compare it. ‘‘ There are many regions of thought,” 
says Lotze,' ‘“‘in which while young we were quite at home, 
which in age we can only bring before our minds as alien 
phenomena ; feelings in which we once revelled with enthusi- 
asm we can now hardly recover at all, we can now hardly 
realize even a pale reflection of the power which they once 
exercised over us ; endeavors which once seemed to constitute 
the most inalienable essence of our ego seem, when we reach 
1 Microcosmus, p. 687. Hamilton and Jones’ translation. Lotze is led 
by these observations to go so far as to proclaim that “in point of fact 
we have little ground for speaking of the personality of finite things ; it is 
an ideal which like all that is ideal, belongs unconditionally only to 
the Infinite, but like all that is good appertains to us only conditionally 
and hence imperfectly.” I for one cannot thus deny to myself the right 
to speak of my personality, and I think myself justified in proclaiming its 
real existence, if only I agree that it is my name for an ever varying and 
constantly developing succession of empirical egos.

the path along which later life conducts us, to be unintelligible 
aberrations, the incentive to which we can no longer under- 
stand.” 
Sec. 10. If it is true, as we argue, that at each of two 
successive moments the empirical ego is new; it is easy to 
account for the fact, to which we have been referring, that we 
are able to recognize the multiplicity of our personalities in 
an objective study. But if this view is warranted we surely 
ought to be able to observe this multiplicity of empirical egos 
also to some extent in our introspective life; not only as 
closely succeeding one another, as appears in the comparison 
of the empirical egos of the past and present referred to in 
the last section ; but also at times as co-existent. 
Some little time ago I had an experience, which I think 
may probably be repeated upon occasion by many among my 
readers, in which the recognition of a co-existent doubleness 
of personality (i.e. of empirical egohood) was clearly distin- 
guished in the course of my appreciation of the experience 
itself, of which I made careful note at the time. 
I sat reading in an American railway carriage with my feet 
crossed so that one foot projected into the aisle. Presently 
my head nodded, my weary eyes closed, and my fellow pas- 
sengers, if they noticed me at all, probably thought I was fast 
asleep. As a matter of fact only part of me was asleep, for 
I found myself thinking somewhat as follows: ‘‘ This is very 
restful, it will be delightful to have a nap ; but I have my foot 
out in the aisle where the first passer-by will surely strike it 
and waken me up.” Here the empirical ego described as J was 
thinking of the sleeping empirical ego described as me. 
Now under normal conditions I should have dropped soon 
into so profound a sleep that I should not have been able to 
recall any of this train of thought when I awakened. If 
aroused to full consciousness by the guard striking my foot, I 
should have merely changed my position and settled myself 
again to sleep. But as it happened the J remained sufficiently
-P-A-G-E-623
  MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 611 
active to carry on the following train of thought. “‘It will be 
a pity to be (to have my me) awakened by the guard: I wish 
my foot were not stretched out into the aisle. If J move my 
foot out of the aisle the movement may possibly waken me. 
If it remains where it is the guard will almost certainly awaken 
me. Will it be better to run the risk of moving my foot 
voluntarily, (that is will it be better to run the risk of the 
Tin moving the foot awakening the me), or shall J let it remain 
and allow myself to be awakened by the guard? will run 
the risk of moving the foot hoping that in so doing I may not 
wake up; (i.e. hoping that in so doing the movements result- 
ing from the efficiency of the J may not awaken the me.)” 
But as a matter of fact the movement accredited to the I 
did awaken the me: and being interested in introspection I 
promptly pulled out a sheet of paper and jotted down the 
notes which form the basis of the above paragraphs. Had 
the J not moved the foot, the sleep would probably have 
become more pervasive and ‘‘sounder” as we say, and all 
relation between the empirical ego of that half-asleep state 
would have been lost to the disparate wide awake empirical 
ego of the moment when I would have been awakened by the 
guard stumbling over my extended foot, and all record of it 
would have been thus lost just because of the utter disparate- 
ness of the two empirical egos which had been involved. 
The case above described exemplifies very clearly the intro- 
spective recognition in the same moment of two diverse em- 
pirical egos. But a little consideration will I think convince 
the reader that closely allied recognitions of doubleness of 
empirical egohood are made most constantly in his every day 
life ; for in fact he acknowledges such doubleness of person- 
ality whenever he compares, as he so commonly does, the 
impulses followed in his actions of a certain past moment of 
his life, with those which he wishes he could believe he had 
followed: that is when he thinks of the ‘‘self” that acted 
(meaning the empirical ego), as quite diverse from what he is
-P-A-G-E-624
  612 THE SELF 
wont to call his ‘‘ better self,” or his ‘‘ true self.” It must of 
course be acknowledged that the ordinary man does not easily 
lay hold of the distinction upon which this common accept- 
ance of the “‘ true self” or ‘‘ better self” is based, for reasons 
connected with the urgency of practical life to be spoken of 
below: but it is clear to my mind that he does experience the 
differences which must be involved if the empirical ego is of 
the nature which we claim for it, even though he fail to inter- 
pret them correctly. 
We have a peculiar instance of this discrimination, in the 
reprobation of attempts at suicide, which in some States are 
treated as criminal offences, just as if the man who had 
attempted to take his life had attacked an entirely different 
individual than himself. 
It seems highly probable that the child often naturally notes 
the distinction between the several empirical egos of experi- 
ence, and often naively refers them to diverse individuals, 
only gradually learning to think of them as referring to one 
and the same individual which he comes to call his self: 
among my notes I find a record of very strong evidence that 
my daughter of seven years exhibited a distinct tendency to 
think of her little sinful acts of her past as having been 
performed by quite another person than herself. But evi- 
dently even if this tendency to observe differences of empirical 
egohood were usual in early youth it would be one which 
would be rapidly lost with maturing years: for the empirical 
egos of immediately successive moments must usually have 
relatively few elements of marked differentiation, and must 
tend to fuse with one another. Those cases where they do 
not fuse are the only ones a man can hope to differentiate ; 
and the developing man must soon learn by experience in 
practical life to act as though even his more distinctly differ- 
entiated empirical egos were really connected with the 
activities of himself as one and the same individual : he cov id 
not live an effective life unless he did learn to make his

judgment and became thoroughly convinced of its correct- 
ness. It is natural therefore that we find fixed most firmly in 
our minds the notion of what we call our personal identity. 
We learn to believe that all our varied empirical egos, how- 
ever much they are differentiated, are in some manner or other 
really one and the same empirical ego. 
Il. Tue Mourasitiry oF THE SELF 
Sec. 11. Under our view the Self of an individual in any 
moment is all the rest of the consciousness of the individual 
other than the marked emphasis within it. At any moment 
each consciousness displays a noetic pattern consisting of the 
noetic emphasis or field of attention, and of the Self or field of 
inattention: and correspondingly the man’s nervous system 
as a whole displays a neururgic pattern, which consists of the 
neururgic emphasis and the neururgic background against 
which this emphasis appears contrasted. 
Now we have already seen that the neururgic situation of 
an individual man must be new and unique in each successive 
moment. And if this is true of the whole neururgic 
pattern of any moment it is true also of its parts ; i.e. it is true 
not only of the neururgic emphasis, but also of the broad 
undifferentiable unemphatic neururgic mass against which 
the emphasis stands contrasted. And the broad neururgic 
mass must therefore be held to display in each moment a new 
and unique neururgic form. 
In like manner we have seen that the noetic situation in any 
given consciousness must in each moment be new and unique. 
And if this is true of each noetic pattern as a whole then it is 
true also of its parts. If this is true of that part of the whole 
noetic pattern which we call the field of attention, as we have 
above seen is acknowledged to be the case; then it must be 
true also of that part which we call the field of inattention,
-P-A-G-E-626
Te eee eT ee eT errr eek in eae 
614 THE SELF 
unless we deny that the field of attention and the field of 
inattention are fundamentally of the same nature. 
We are led thus to hold that in each moment the field of 
inattention is a new and unique thing. And, if we assume 
that the field of inattention and the Self are the same and 
identical, as we are here contending, then we are necessarily 
led to hold that the Self of each moment is unique: that no 
Self “‘once gone can ever recur and be identical with what it 
was before:” that the Self of any individual man, in each 
moment, is a new and unique Self. It seems impossible to 
avoid this conclusion without denying the truth of the neuro- 
logical and psychological statements above made, which are 
very generally accepted as valid; nor without showing that 
the various positions here referred to as maintained in the 
previous chapters are invalid. 
Sec. 12. When we ask ourselves whether it is possible to 
adduce evidence in favor of this purely theoretical position 
we find ourselves again face to face with the difficulty that we 
have no means of learning by direct introspective observation 
what our Selves are like; for the ego of introspection turns 
out to be merely a presentation of a special type. As the 
result of an indirect mode of reasoning, however, we have 
come to believe the empirical ego to be a simulacrum of the 
Self ; and this leads us to hold that we can indirectly judge 
of the nature of the Self of which this empirical ego is a 
verisimilitude. But we have seen that we discover in 
introspection that the empirical ego of each moment is new 
and unique, and we are therefore led to hold that the Self ot 
which it is a simulacrum must in each moment be new and. 
unique. 
We also recall our observation that a man’s character as 
objectively viewed corresponds with the whole of the man’s 
consciousness ; and that this consciousness is inclusive of his 
Self which is unpresented. 
When we judge thus objectively of the nature of other
-P-A-G-E-627
SIE CR eT CREEL oe tet ee 
MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 615 
men’s Selves we are especially struck by what we call their 
individuality, i.e. by the fact that no two of them are ever 
exactly alike; and we are all ready to agree that in any one 
moment chosen for consideration the Self of each of all the 
individual men under observation is a unique Self. But 
when we come to study the matter more closely we note that 
just such differences as appear in different individuals, and 
which lead us to hold each of them to be an unique Self, 
appear also in one and the same individual at different 
moments. If we have judged correctly in the first case we 
should therefore be led to say that a man who displays such 
differences in two successive moments has different Selves in 
the two moments. 
When we consider such cases as that of Miss Beauchamp 
referred to above, we note that in a large proportion of the 
observations of Dr. Prince he was judging of the woman’s 
Self of the moment. At times to be sure she was self-con- 
scious and appreciative of the existence of her empirical ego, 
but in the main her varied Selves were judged of by reference 
to her changes of character. 
But we may turn from the abnormal to the normal, and if I 
may be allowed the privilege may consider the evidence in 
connection with an ordinary man like myself. When in the 
routine of life I reach my business office of a morning, my 
character, as it would appear to an observer who judged solely 
from the nature of my reactions, would seem quite as diverse 
from the character of the man who writes these words during 
the quiet of a country visit, as could be the case were the two 
characters observed in different individual human bodies. 
But for the fact that the outward appearance and certain 
mannerisms of the person in the architect’s office, and of the 
person in the country library, are the same, it would never 
occur to an observer of the two that the characters, as inclusive 
of the Selves, were those of one and the same personality. 
The architect deals almost exclusively with concrete objects ;
-P-A-G-E-628
e 
616 THE SELF 
finding himself constantly called upon to render prompt deci- 
sions; busied with considerations of design; aiming to 
produce works of beauty; actively engaged through the 
instrumentality of his own pencil, or through the direction of 
his assistants, in the preparation of the drawings which are the 
effective tools of his guild. The psychologist on the other 
hand deals with generalizations of a broad nature; with 
introspective observations which are as far as possible removed 
from the every day objects in the outer world ; he deliberates 
long before reaching conclusions, being often content to hold 
in abeyance decision as to the validity of conflicting notions ; 
he searches after truth rather than beauty, and aims at 
schematic arrangement and logical results: he is slow of 
thought, and deliberate in action in the preparation of what 
he merely hopes may some day stimulate the thought of 
others who like himself search for truth in a very special 
field. 
It may be claimed that I am an abnormal person, that it is 
unusual for a man to have such very fully developed diverse 
interests as those which engage my thoughts, and that it is 
relatively rare to find any one man of such diversities of char- 
acters as I have been above describing ; but I believe this is 
not nearly so unusual as it at first sight appears. The closer 
we observe our fellow men the more clear seems the correspon- 
dence between such Selves as we consider unique when given 
in any one moment in different individuals, and the Selves 
which are judged to exist in successive moments in one and 
the same individual: and were there no evidence other than 
this, it alone should lead us to see the strength of the hypo- 
thesis that each Self, of each man, in each moment, is a new 
and unique Self. 
Sec. 13. It is of course Self-evident that if it prove true, 
as Dr. Morton Prince’s experiments above referred to seem to 
imply, that thoroughly systematized diverse consciousnesses 
1Confer also chapter vi.

MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 617 
can co-exist in relation with the body of one individual, as 
“*co-consciousnesses” to use Dr. Prince’s phrase, then diverse 
empirical egos, and diverse Selves, must co-exist as co-ego’s 
and co-Selves, if we may so speak. 
III]. Corrozsorative EvipEeNnce 
Sec. 14. When we recur to the considerations set forth in 
Chapters xxrv. and xxvr. above, we perceive that we have there 
actually assumed the mutability of the empirical ego and of the 
Self without any appearance of contradiction of experience. 
The relations between the empirical ego and its objects, and 
those between the Self and it presentations, treated of in 
, Chapter xxrv., have everywhere indicated a reciprocity of 
efficiency ; and evidence has there been constantly forced upon 
us that the nature of objects given from time to time to the 
same individual is changed because at different moments the 
empirical ego is diverse in its nature ; and in like manner that 
the form of presentations to the Self is altered from moment to 
moment because the Self changes. And again in Chapter 
xxv. we have seen that the emphasis of the general qualities 
of objects and presentations changes the nature of the empiri- 
cal egos and Selves respectively ; even as the varying nature 
of these empirical egos and Selves changes the emphasis of 
the general qualities in the objects and presentations respec- 
tively. 
Sec. 15. But had we been led to this result by no other 
considerations we might properly have concluded that each 
empirical ego is unique, and each Self unique, from the well 
recognized fact that both are subject to development. As 
the reader will recall, we have already seen reason to hold that 
the neururgic modifications which are involved in what we 
call “learning by experience” are not of occasional, but of 
universal occurrence throughout the organic world: it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-630
ee ee ee ee 
618 THE SELF i 
difficult to understand the basis of organic development unless 
we acknowledge this general principle. And if organic de- 
velopment involves this principle it should also be traceable 
in the psychic coincidents of this organic development. 
If then we discover any process of development in the 
empirical ego it must be because it is subject to this universal 
process of being affected by experience, and because it is in 
each successive moment a different entity. That each indi- 
viduals empirical ego is a thing which has in the past 
developed, and which is constantly developing during life, is 
a fact that we need not stop here to illustrate, for it must seem 
evident to any one of mature years that his ego of self-con- 
scious states is a much more complex and fuller experience 
than that of his youth as he is able to recall it. 
And surely the same is true of a man’s Self, if its nature 
from youth to age may be judged by his objectively observed 
character. ‘That the character of a man changes as he de- 
velopes from childhood to youth, from youth to maturity, 
from maturity to old age, will not be questioned ; and this 
means that not only his experienced ego but also his Self has 
correspondingly changed. While these changes in some 
persons appear to be momentous and sudden at certain excep- 
tional periods, it will be generally agreed that for the most 
part they are exceedingly gradual; so gradual indeed that a 
man is often surprised, in looking back upon the years past, 
to find how much his character has altered without any 
recognition of the changes which have been going on. 
If then we are once led to acknowledge that such gradual 
changes do occur it is most natural surely to assume that they 
are the result of a continuous process ; and this again carries 
with it the view not only that each man’s empirical ego, but 
also that each man’s Self, of each moment is new and 
unique. 
 
-P-A-G-E-631
MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 619 
IV. Or Personat IDENTITY 
Sec. 16. It would seem needless to dwell, as we have done, 
upon the evidence in favor of the view here discussed, were it 
not for the fact that it is repulsive to the average man, and this 
largely because he is very generally accustomed in his daily 
conversation to make the explicit assumption that his empirical 
ego and his Self are unalterable and persistent entities ; and in 
fact upon this notion, as we shall see in Chapter xxv1t., he bases 
certain of his most cherished conceptions and doctrines. Iam 
referring here of course to our conception and experience of 
what is called ‘‘ personal identity.” 
Of the concept of personal identity so far as it relates to 
metaphysical positions we have not a word to say, except that 
it actually implies the existence of variable experienced empiri- 
cal egos in its assumption that a certain core or essence which 
is the true and real Self remains unperturbed through all these 
variations. Why metaphysicians persist in speaking of what 
are acknowledgedly shifting attachments to this postulated 
core or essence, as part and parcel of our every day egos or 
Selves, as do those who uphold this widely accepted dogma, 
is a question the mere psychologist cannot be expected to 
comprehend. 
But apart from this and kindred questions we may lay aside 
all considerations of this nature for the simple reason that we 
are concerned to deal with the egos of experience, and with 
Selves as parts of consciousness in the moments of their 
existence. 
It may be noted however in the interest of clearness that 
no concept of the Self can be the real Self ;\ for being a concept 
it must be a presentation to this true Self which is non-present- 
able. Nor is it in the mind of the ordinary man a concept 
which relates to the existence of a true Self that is not given 
as a presentation : rather is it for him a concept which relates
-P-A-G-E-632
  620 THE SELF 
to the succession of empirical egos, with which as preserita- 
tions in attention he is familiar. 
Sec. 17. The objector to the position we maintain may 
claim that his opposition is warranted just because introspec- 
tion tells us that our own successive experiences of the Self 
are the same : even though it be agreed that in these successive 
experiences there are differences of superficial attributes, he 
is likely to persist in holding that these attributes cling to an 
experienced unchangeable core, which is the true Self. He 
will tell us, to use the words of Miss Calkins,! that ‘‘the self 
is . . . in some degree permanent and persistent.” 
Yet it is clear that this fact does not substantiate his posi- 
tion, for evidently we are here dealing with the appreciated 
empirical ego. As Miss Calkins goes on to say, “by per- 
sistence is not meant the ultimate self identity which may 
well be part of the Self as conceived by the philosopher, but 
rather the kind of identity of which one is immediately con- 
scious, notably in anticipating and recognizing.’ And when 
we note this then we are led to see that when any man claims 
that he appreciates the persistence of an empirical ego he is 
making a comparison: that he is recalling two successive 
empirical egos, and noting in connection with these revivals 
the attendant “‘ likeness sense of relation” which leads him to 
call them ‘‘ the same.” 
But as we have noted in Chapter v. we can never make a 
judgment that two mental items are very much alike, or even 
e “‘the same,” unless in some measure they differ. Were 
they identically the same the revivals would be fused into one, 
and no ground for comparison would exist. As we have seen 
in the chapter above referred to, while it is true that com- 
parison cannot exist except where there exist identities within 
the partial presentations compared, these identities are within 
the experience of comparison, and do not necessarily imply 
an identity inherent in the original elements which we speak 
1 Journal of Philosophy, etc. v. 3, p. 65.
-P-A-G-E-633
  MUTABILITY OF EGO AND SELF 621 
of as the same. As Prof. James! well says ‘‘The sense of 
our personal identity, . . . is exactly like any one of our 
other perceptions of sameness among phenomena. It is a 
conclusion grounded either on the resemblance in a funda- 
mental respect, or on the continuity before the mind of the 
phenomena compared” ; the phenomena compared in this case 
being separate, but closely allied, empirical egos. ‘‘ Where 
the resemblance and continuity are no longer felt, the sense of 
personality goes too.” . . . ‘“Resemblance among the parts” 
(in this instance the differentiated empirical egos), ‘‘of a con- 
tinuance of feelings (especially bodily feelings) experienced 
along with things widely different in all other regards, thus 
constitutes the real and verifiable ‘personal identity’ that we 
feel.” Or as Locke? long ago said, ‘‘ whatever has the con- 
sciousness of present and past actions is the same person to 
whom they both belong ;” a statement which Prof. James* 
has picturesquely paraphrased in saying that this personal 
identity experience ‘‘is just your chain of particular 
memories.” But, as we have seen in Chapter x1x., the fact 
that memory exists does not imply any persistent unalterable 
condition of a somewhat which remembers; and so we have 
a final break down of the argument from the experience of 
personal identity in opposition to the notion that each empirical 
ego is new and unique. 
Sec. 18. When we turn to the consideration of the Self 
we see that the experience of “‘ personal identity,” relating 
as it does to the empirical ego, cannot relate to the Self: and 
if this is true this experience presents no objection whatever

Jas. Mill’s Analysis, chap. v. p. 228. “The notion of a Self is, I 
apprehend, a consequence of Memory. There is no meaning in the word 
Ego or I, unless the I of to-day is also the I of yesterday ; a permanent 
element which abides through a succession of feelings, and connects the 
feeling of each moment with the remembrance of previous feelings.”
-P-A-G-E-634
622 THE SELF 
to the view that the non-presentable Self of each moment is 
new and unique. 
As psychologists we realize that when consciousness is 
viewed in retrospect successive presentations appear to de- 
velope one from the other, so that we come to recognize the 
existence of what Dr. Ward calls the ‘‘ presentation con- 
tinuum,” notwithstanding that, as we are convinced, each 
specific presentation must be new and unique. So also we 
have no difficulty in holding that as the Self is part of con- 
scious experience, and is fundamentally of the same nature as 
the presentations to the Self ; so although each moment’s Self 
is new and unique, nevertheless each Self developes as it were 
from the Self of the preceding moment. And in reflection 
we may well conceive of a Self as a whole which will appear 
as a continuum ; a continuum in which the psychic elements 
are never identically recurrent, although their differences 
cannot be noted even objectively, inasmuch as the elements 
themselves are undifferentiable. 
The repulsion which we are likely to feel to the doctrine 
here maintained is largely due to the attribute of instability,— 
of unrealness,—which thus becomes attached to the notion of 
the Self, which most of us have come to feel is of all concep- 
tions the most real.1_ Those who have studied the nature of 
realness with us in previous chapters must see however that 
none of the realness which is properly attachable to the Self 
is lost as a result of this view; and that the exemplification 
of the true nature of, and the practical value of, this attribute 
of realness in connection with the Self goes far to answer the 
objections to the doctrine of the relativity of realness upheld 
in previous chapters.

| Sec. 1. Iv will be conceded I think that the average man’s 
conception of his responsibility for his acts in the past is very 
» clearly bound up with the notion that his true Self is some- 
thing which is permanent ; which was the active agent in the 
performance of a deed which he recalls in memory ; and which, 
as now again capable of action, must bear the burden of guilt 
if that past action was culpable, or enjoy the meed of satis- 
faction and of reward if it was praiseworthy. In other words 
the common conception of responsibility relates to the experi- 
ential Self, and involves the notion of the continuing per- 
sistence of this Self during life. 
But we have seen in the preceding chapter that our studies 
lead us to the conclusion that the Self is always a new and 
unique Self, and we are at once led to see that if this is true 
we are forced to search for some rational ground for this con- 
ception of responsibility which has been based upon the notion 
of a persistent Self ; for it is not clear that we are justified 
in holding that this new and unique Self of mine, as it exists 
in this present moment, is culpable or worthy of praise, as the 
* case may be, for the act which I ascribe to the efficiency of 
~ my Self in a past moment: for, under our hypothesis, the 
Self which was involved in the act of the past is not the Self    
-P-A-G-E-636
  624 COROLLARIES 
which now exists; and in connection with the actions of my 
individual body in the past there seems at first sight no more 
clear reason for praising or blaming this new Self of mine, 
than for praising or blaming any other new Self existing in 
this present moment in any other individual man than myself. 
As this question of man’s responsibility is of the deepest 
moment in relation to his moral life, and of the greatest prac- 
tical importance in relation to his development, the questions 
above raised evidently demand very careful consideration ; 
and it will be worth our while to begin our study of them by 
an attempt to analyse the notion of responsibility itself, and 
to consider the basis of its validity, and how far this validity 
is dependent upon the notion of the permanence of the Self 
with which it is usually so closely interwoven. 
Sec. 2. a. It seems clear in the first place that this subject 
may be looked upon from two entirely different points of 
view. If in the first place we could study mankind in a 
thoroughly objective manner, as we study the activities of the 
insects, for example; that is, if we could consider man’s life 
from the standpoint which might be maintained by a non- 
human “‘ spirit” unaware of man’s conscious states; we should 
then observe men capturing an individual in the act of com- 
mitting what we call a crime, and treating him in a certain 
manner ; and we should observe in other cases the same body 
of men treating another individual man in practically the same 
manner long after the commission of the same kind of crime, 
and when the criminal appeared to be perfectly passive and 
harmless. We might for instance see a man killed by a 
constable who happened to catch him in the act of murdering 
his wife: but we should also observe certain cases where the 
murderer is killed by hanging because he had been seen to 
murder his wife long before the execution, and notwithstand- 
ing that at the time of his hanging he appears to be a perfectly 
quiet and well mannered member of society. We should see 
a thief, who was caught stealing some one’s watch, compelled 
 
-P-A-G-E-637
    COROLLARIES 625 
to hand it back to the owner; but in other cases we should 
see learned judges and lawyers joining forces in the civil courts 
to compel a man A to restore property to another man B when 
it became evident that, if A had improperly appropriated the 
property of B, he had done so, not at an immediately pre- 
ceding moment, but years and years before. These observa- 
tions, could we maintain this ultra objective attitude of mind, 
would be made without any consideration whatever of the 
conscious states of the men who were active in the several 
cases: and we should conclude that the individual man of to- 
day, although now perfectly harmless, is held responsible for 
the acts of his individual body in previous days or months 
or years. 
8. But we, as men, are forced to consider this question 
of responsibility also from a subjective point of view; we 
are unable to avoid noting the sense of guilt and remorse 
we experience in connection with evil deeds which we recall 
in the active life of our own individual bodies in days that are 
past; and unable to avoid taking satisfaction in good deeds 
which we in like manner attach to our own individual bodies 
as they existed in the past. 
It will be desirable to consider this subject more at length 
from these two points of view; to ask ourselves in the first 
place, whether it is rational, from an objective standpoint, to 
hold a given individual responsible today for the deeds of his 
individual body in the past, now that we have come to realize 
that the man’s Self today is a different Self from that which 
in the past led him to his culpable deeds ; and then to ask our- 
selves whether it is rational, from a subjective standpoint, to 
allow ourselves to be burdened by remorse for deeds of the 
past, when we know that our present Selves are new and 
unique Selves, and not the Selves that voluntarily committed 
those deeds which we recall with regret. 
Sec. 3. Before taking up this study from the objective 
point of view it may be well to forestall criticism in one 
2R 
 
-P-A-G-E-638
626 COROLLARIES 
direction. It may be claimed by some that the maintenance 
of such a purely objective attitude as we suggest is impossible ; 
for it may be held that we cannot account for the acts of men 
as objectively viewed without considering their conscious 
states, and noting that no individual man would be led to 
hold other men responsible for their past acts did he not in 
his innermost experience find the sense of responsibility for 
his own individual acts in the past. 
The objective view of responsibility has doubtless been 
bound up with, and has developed coordinately with, the 
subjective sense of responsibility ; and I am free to admit that 
probably the early man would not have held his neighbor in 
any measure responsible had he not felt the germs of the sense 
of obligation within himself. On the other hand, however, 
it seems clear that the objective knowledge that other men 
are held responsible for their past acts has had, and still has, 
much to do with the development in us of our own inward 
sense of responsibility for what we recall as the voluntary 
acts of our past Selves ; although as we shall see presently it 
cannot be maintained that this objective knowledge is alone 
of import in relation to this development. 
The point I would make here is that this inward sense of 
responsibility could never have developed from its germ to 
what it is in us today, had not the application of this sense 
of our own responsibility to other men been of very great 
practical benefit to man in the course of his development. 
For we must grant I think that, had it been disadvantageous 
to the human race as a whole to hold other men responsible 
for their acts of the past, we men might indeed still feel a 
certain undeveloped sense of guilt and remorse, and yet would 
find ourselves impelled usually to refrain altogether from 
practical efforts to enforce upon other men the reality of the 
responsibility which they incur in each act.! 
1 For a fuller study of this question compare my Instinct and Reason, 
chapter xv.
-P-A-G-E-639
  COROLLARIES 627 
It is desirable therefore, in relation to our theory of the 
nature of the Self, to consider quite objectively the advantage 
to the race connected with the responsibility which we demand 
of other men, which in its reaction has had so much to do 
with the development of our own sense of personal responsi- 
bility. 
B 
Sec. 4. Taking then this objective point of view we may 
remind ourselves that all men are practical before they are 
self-consciously rational. We inherit, or acquire, habits of 
action which are followed without thought ; and only later, 
when doubt arises as to the meaning or propriety of these 
habits of action, do we stop to consider why we have followed 
them, and then for the first time do we question the rationality 
of the acts to which they lead us. 
It is thus that man has formulated the complex system of 
legal restrictions which involves what we here speak of as 
objective responsibility. The individual in the beginning has 
adopted certain self-protective habits which involve the 
punishment of one who does him harm, in order that the latter 
may be immediately disabled or otherwise prevented from 
repeating his hurtful act. These self-protective habits in their 
elementary nature are purely instinctive, but they have been 
elaborated as man has gained intelligence to recognize ends 
and means to ends, and as such have been handed down from 
generation to generation by tradition, until we find them 
developed first into a body of customs, and finally formed 
into systems of law, which themselves have been widened in 
scope so that they no longer relate only to the protection of 
the individual, but relate more especially to that of the race 
to which the individual belongs. 
If this view is correct it appears that punishment for crime 
has not been primarily due to a belief in the responsibility 
of the criminal, but rather to the necessity of devising 
   
-P-A-G-E-640
628 COROLLARIES 
measures of protection, which were adopted first by the indi- 
vidual, and then extended to include protection of the social 
body by the state. This is made the clearer when we note, 
for instance, that at certain stages of development a man who 
is known to belong to a class which is looked upon as dan- 
gerous is under certain conditions punished as a representative 
of this dangerous class, although he may not himself have 
committed any overt act of a hostile nature: among bar- 
barous tribes all strangers are treated as enemies; and even 
in our own day, in our punitive expeditions against the 
“lower races,” the men and boys of a tribe that is thought 
to be hostile are at times ruthlessly slain by those whose 
atavistic passions have been aroused, even when these mem- 
bers of the hostile tribe have shown no signs of evil intent. 
Without question, pari passu with the growth of these 
systems of protective punishment, there has appeared an 
emphasis of the notion of responsibility which is found in its 
germ in the inner sense of every man: nevertheless an objec- 
tive view so clearly shows the priority of practice to insight 
that Herbert Spencer and others, as the reader will recall, have 
been able to argue that the sense of obligation is altogether 
a result of what are collaterals of the habits of reward and 
punishment,—that our sense of obligation is entirely due to 
the fact, as Prof. M‘Gilvary puts it, ‘‘that commandments 
get their binding character because of the ‘reasons annexed? 
to them and that these reasons consist in threats.” 1 
Sec. 5. As self-preservative punishment has developed in 
this way until it has come to relate to the preservation of 
individuals as elements of a social whole, the relation between 
the commission of the crime, and the action protecting the 
individual or social body, has become changed. The savage 
individual who is attacked strikes the attacker without a 
moment’s delay ; but under the complex development of legal 
systems the protection of the social body by the punishment 
1 Phisosophical Review, xi. 4, p. 349.
-P-A-G-E-641
  COROLLARIES 629 
of the offender cannot be so summarily accomplished: and 
in our day this punishment is usually dealt out, not by the 
one attacked, but by authorized agents of the state ; and then 
only after the offender has been tried by a “‘ jury of his peers,” 
and judged by them after cool deliberation to have been guilty 
of the crime. Beyond this we find a growing tendency to 
punish a man for a crime once committed, even if his guilt 
remains undiscovered until many years have elapsed, during 
which he may have lived an altogether harmless life, and may 
have become a thoroughly reformed and highly useful citizen. 
So firmly established has this habit of punishment become 
that, as the reader knows, it has often led to the notion that 
the punishment of crime is in itself of prime importance ; and 
this in its turn has led certain barbarous peoples to suppose 
that the crimes committed by one man, perhaps unknown, 
could be expiated by the punishment of a recognizedly inno- 
cent person. Asa rule however, where the criminal has been 
known, the responsibility has always been felt to rest upon 
him, and upon him alone; and if vengeance was wreaked 
upon others it has been because these others were felt in some 
way to be in part responsible for his acts. The will of indi- 
viduals, which on the whole is represented in existing customs 
and laws, would not in general lead to the punishment of 
one man for a crime which another had committed ; and as 
it has been easy on the whole to keep in mind the individual 
human being, and to prove that what we know as the same 
human body which existed when the crime was committed 
exists on the day of punishment ; so it has been assumed that 
the Self which actuated the man to commit the crime, was the 
same Self that actuates the man who is punished, it may be 
years after the crime was committed. 
The change of procedure between summary immediate 
retribution upon the offender, and that of even the crudest 
of legal systems of punishment, has involved slow develop- 
ment through so many ages, and such slight advances in
-P-A-G-E-642
    630 COROLLARIES 
successive generations, that no circumstances would be likely 
to occur to raise the question as to the identity of the Self of 
the criminal, and of the Self of the man punished ; and it is 
not surprising therefore that the notion should naturally be 
held today that, in any instance where we have not lost sight 
of the individual man, the Self which actuated the crime is 
the same Self which actuates the living individual from whom 
we demand retribution. 
We have, in my view, in this gradual growth of legal 
systems, in connection with the enforcement it has brought 
of the notion of a persistent Self, an adequate psychological 
explanation, were there no other, of the fact that this belief 
in an unchangeable Self has become so fixed in our whole 
scheme of thought that it can with great difficulty be dis- 
placed. 
Sec. 6. It is evident thus that the common assumption 
that the Self of a man remains unchanged from day to day, 
and from year to year, is one which has become inextricably 
bound up with conceptions which have been of great value 
to the race, and that in this way it may be said to have been 
indirectly of very great service in the protection of individual 
and social life in the past ; and it is equally clear that it has 
been most natural to make this assumption because we have 
during the passing days and years noted no sufficient visible 
change in the body of the man, which appears as the instru- 
ment of the Self, to warrant us in believing that he has not 
remained the same man during the observed intervals of time. 
On the other hand it seems equally clear that even if men 
had long since recognized as a fact that the Self which actuates 
the-man when he commits a crime is not the same Self that 
actuates the man who is punished, nevertheless they would 
not have been deterred from adopting the self-protective 
devices which we speak ’of as the punishment for crime ; and 
this for the simple reason that the development of civilization 
could not have occurred without such self-protective measures:
-P-A-G-E-643
  COROLLARIES 631 
It is certain however that, had the changeable nature of 
the Self been recognized, men would not have been content 
with the rationalized basis of their conceptions of objective 
responsibility which satisfies them today; but would have 
modified these long ago, as they surely must eventually if the 
theory here upheld is a true one. It remains for us then to 
enquire in what respect our views of objective responsibility 
must be altered if we accept the theory that the Self of a man 
is in each moment a new and unique Self. 
Sec. 7. That we may make this enquiry intelligently it 
will be well for us to ask what element in this assumption of 
the continuity of the Self is of fundamental import to the 
perfection of the protective systems in connection with which 
this assumption of continuity has been maintained. 
Now clearly it is not of any great importance to such a 
protective system whether the Self be the same from moment 
to moment or not, provided the acts of the individual man 
whom we keep in view are practically the same from moment 
to moment under like environmental conditions. We are 
thus led to see that the fundamental conception upon which 
is based our notion of objective responsibility is, not the 
notion that the Self is a persistent unchangeable entity, but 
rather the notion that the Self of the present moment would 
act under similar conditions just as the Self of the man did 
who in some past day committed the crime. This in truth 
those of us who think carefully know is not actually the case ; 
but we also know that the changes in the manner of the man’s 
reaction from day to day are so slight that in general they may 
be overlooked. 
Our law then, and the opinion of men ‘which it represents, 
in affirming objective responsibility merely holds that the Self 
of the individual man of this moment would not be what it 
is had not a Self of a certain recognized type existed in con- 
nection with the body, which we call the same individual man, 
at the time of his criminal act. But beyond this it holds also, 
 
-P-A-G-E-644
632 COROLLARIES 
more broadly, that each Self of a special man of each moment 
would not be what it is but for the previous existence of all 
the Selves of this special man with which it is acquainted ; as 
is shown by our efforts to discover the general character of 
the man who has committed a crime, and by the lightening 
of his punishment in many cases where it is shown that the 
Self which actuated the crime was not the man’s usual Self. 
It is really because of this assumption, viz. that the man’s Self 
of each moment is dependent upon the nature of all the Selves 
which we picture as having actuated the man’s deeds in the 
past, that we hold that, were the situation repeated, the Self 
of this moment would act, were it allowed to do so, practically 
as the Self did in the moment of the criminal act; and for 
that reason the law maintains that it is warranted in entering 
in and protecting the social body, either by the killing of the 
criminal, or by isolating him and thus avoiding the occurrence 
of opportunities for him to act as he once has acted, or by 
the infliction of penalties which will tend to change his Self 
so materially that under the same given conditions he will not 
act as he did when he committed the crime. 
Now it is perfectly clear that the modern psychologist, if 
he maintains that the Self of an individual is always a new 
and unique Self, must nevertheless also hold the view which 
would be gained from the standpoint just described. He will 
find it necessary in other words to hold that the Self of an 
individual at any moment, although a new Self, is nevertheless 
what it is only because other Selves of a definite character 
have in the past existed in connection with his individual 
body. This Self of this moment must be what it is because 
of the inheritance of forms which have occurred in the life 
history of an indefinitely long line of ancestors, and because of 
modifications which have been effective during the existence 
of his body as a separate individual; and we realize that in 
no way can this form of the Self of this present moment be 
altered in a manner which can eliminate the influences due to
-P-A-G-E-645
  COROLLARIES © 633 
this inheritance, and to these past experiences, which have 
determined the nature of the Selves which have previously 
existed in connection with the individual under consideration. 
It becomes clear then that the assumption which is really 
the basis of objective responsibility is one which is quite com- 
patible with our assumption that the Self of an individual is 
always a new Self ; and it is evident therefore that this latter 
assumption which we are making will in no manner affect 
current customs based upon the notion of this objective 
responsibility. 
Sec. 8. Before we turn from the consideration of objective 
responsibility it may be well for us to note certain corollaries 
of the views here maintained which have bearing upon current 
practice in relation to the punishment of crime. 
If it is true that the Self of each man at any moment is 
what it is only because of the previous existence of all the 
other Selves which have appeared in connection with his indi- 
vidual body during his life; and if our notions of objective 
responsibility are based upon this fact ; then it appears clear 
that, if a man is held to be responsible for the acts initiated 
by his Self of any one moment, he must be also held to be 
responsible for all of the acts initiated by all of his previously 
existing Selves. Or in other words if it is held that a man 
is responsible at all, it must be held that he is never irre- 
sponsible, that he must always bear the burden of his deeds 
in the past. 
That this is not in accord with current views is evident : 
for it is commonly held that men whom we call imbeciles, or 
insane, are irresponsible ; as are also the very young, and men 
who are temporarily maddened, say by excessive drinking. 
And in consideration of their supposed irresponsibility, such 
people are often relieved from punishment to which they 
would be liable if they were held to be responsible, and which 
it is of evident advantage to the state to inflict. 
As a matter of fact I think it may be maintained that we
-P-A-G-E-646
  634 COROLLARIES 
do not in general punish a man because we hold him re- 
sponsible for his deeds in the past, although we usually lay 
claim to such a rational procedure: rather on the contrary do 
we hold a man responsible because we think he ought to be 
punished. When it is clear that a human individual has 
committed a crime, but when we do not deem it in our interest, 
or in the interest of humanity as a whole, that his crime be 
punished ; then we, quite irrationally if we hold to current 
notions, trump up some reason for declaring him to have 
been irresponsible at the time of the criminal act. When we 
pity the girl who has killed the man who has wronged her, 
we say that she was temporarily insane when she committed 
the murder ; that is, we do not wish to punish her as a mur- 
derer, and we therefore declare her to have been irresponsible 
at the time of the act. When we see the child steal, and 
are overcome by compassion, we claim that its youth carried 
with it irresponsibility, and that the child should go un- 
punished. 
The practical difficulty in connection with such a view as 
that commonly held lies in the great diversity of opinion, and 
the great uncertainty of opinion, as to when a human being 
is to be held responsible and be punished, and when he is to 
be held irresponsible and go free. This difficulty disappears 
entirely however if we once accept the view here maintained, 
that a human being is at each moment to be held responsible 
for all the acts committed by him as an individual; and if 
we then acknowledge frankly that we punish crime not because 
the criminal is responsible, (for that he always is,) but because 
we wish to protect ourselves, and the society of which we are 
elements. At once then our action becomes thoroughly 
rational. 
With this aim clear before us we may hold that, although 
the child is responsible for its theft in the past, it is not worth 
our while to punish him as we would an adult, for the reason 
that, if put under proper guidance in a better environment
-P-A-G-E-647
  COROLLARIES 635 
than that in which he was born, he will in all probability 
develop a moral sense that will produce in him Selves incapable 
of theft. We may hold that although the wronged girl was 
responsible for the murder of her faithless lover, she is a 
woman who under proper guidance may lead a normal life 
of usefulness; and we may quite rationally decide not to 
punish her by hanging, but to place her under such educative 
restraint as will enable her to avoid such conditions as those 
which led to her crime. We may believe that a man was an 
imbecile who killed his devoted mother, or that another was 
what we chose to call insane when he killed his wife ; and we 
may judge this from the evidence of continued imbecility in 
the one case, and in the other from the fact that the man was 
subject, before the criminal act, to fits of madness: but we 
will not hold either the one or the other the less responsible 
for their acts. We will rather argue that society must be 
protected from the danger of having in its midst men who 
are liable to murder other men, either through imbecility or 
because they are subject to attacks of homicidal mania, and 
that we may therefore quite properly incarcerate them in 
asylums. If the man who has been subject to attacks of mania 
is held to be curable, and after a long test is believed by 
expert psychiatrists to be cured, then we may quite rationally 
release him, with warnings to his friends to watch him closely 
for recurrence of the symptoms of the old disease which led 
him to commit the crime. 
Such a rational course of procedure would obviate many a 
scandal in our courts, where criminals so often set up the plea 
of insanity in order to prove themselves to have been irre- 
sponsible at the time of the criminal act, hoping thus to avoid 
punishment. Were we perfectly rational we would say to 
such an one :—‘‘ You are thoroughly responsible for that act 
of your past-Self. All that you can attempt to prove is that 
you are a man who has once been mad, and when thus mad 
has committed a crime. Against such a man we are bound
-P-A-G-E-648
  636 COROLLARIES 
to protect ourselves, for the reason that if like conditions recur 
you may again commit similar acts ; and to this end we shall 
incarcerate you permanently, or long enough to assure our- 
selves that you are no longer the kind of man who is likely 
to commit such criminal acts ; or we may even determine to 
hang you, if we believe that others who are of your type may 
be deterred from like crimes by the knowledge that the 
punishment for such crimes is death.” 
If once our people at large acknowledged that each indi- 
vidual could in no way escape from the responsibility attaching 
to all of his acts in the past our penal enactments would be 
in the long run much more rational, and much more just. 
We would then concern ourselves no longer with questions 
as to when men are responsible and when irresponsible, but 
with questions relating to the value of punishment and its 
practical effects. We would consider more thoroughly the 
cost to the State of its corrective institutions and constabulary, 
and judge how far the restrictions thus maintained are of 
value: we would enquire how far restrictive punishment is 
necessary for the protection of society ; and, where it is not 
deemed absolutely necessary, how far it is of value to the 
individual as a member of the social body. In my view such 
a rational consideration of the subject would lead to a surer 
and more speedy betterment of social conditions, than a con- 
sideration based upon the notion that responsibility for one’s 
acts may in certain cases be shifted by appealing to the sur- 
roundings and conditions which have led up to the criminal | 
act, or to the unfortunate state of the man’s health, or to his 
morbid development, or to his youth and inexperience. 
Cc 
Sec. 9. Let us now turn from this objective, to a sub- 
jective, view of responsibility. As we have already noted, 
it seems highly probable that, unless the inward sense of
-P-A-G-E-649
COROLLARIES 637 
personal responsibility for his own past acts had existed in 
man in its germinal form, it would never have occurred to 
him that it was rational to hold his fellow responsible for acts 
which could be traced to him in his past life. The notion of 
objective responsibility, as thus derived, has as we have seen 
been greatly changed in connection with the development of 
practical protective measures with which it has become associ- 
ated ; and these protective measures have without doubt had 
a very profound effect in emphasizing in the minds of men 
the force of this inward sense of personal responsibility: but 
it cannot be claimed for a moment that the sense of our own 
responsibility is determined by the pressure of social insti- 
tutions alone; for on no such ground can we explain the 
self-evident fact that our inner sense of responsibility goes 
beyond the limits set by law and custom, and involves the 
recognition of responsibility for sins of which the law takes 
no cognizance, and which custom condones if it does not 
altogether overlook. 
But in the thought of the average man this inner sense of 
responsibility for the act of his individual body in the past 
is bound up with the conviction that his Self is an unchange- 
able entity. He may well then ask us why we should burden 
ourselves with remorse, if the Self of the moment is not the 
same Self that willed the act which we recognize now to have 
been sinful. Surely, he may say, if the Self of each moment 
is a new and unique Self, then this moment’s Self cannot 
rationally be called to account for what a quite other Self did 
in the past, and the man cannot be warranted in worrying 
himself about these past acts. 
Here again we must go back of our crude notion of our 
own individual responsibility, and note that what is important 
in that crude notion is the conviction that the Self of this 
moment is what it is because of the existence in the past, in 
connection with the same individual body, of other Selves 
that performed acts which we now regard as having been 
   
-P-A-G-E-650
  638 COROLLARIES 
sinful. And this, as we have seen, is exactly what our doc- 
trine teaches; for it tells us that our present Selves are 
products, as it were, of all other Selves which have existed 
in connection with the past acts of our individual bodies ; 
and that we cannot disconnect our present Selves from those 
previously existing Selves, without assuming that our present 
Selves are other than they really are. 
Sec. 10. It may be claimed that, even if we view the matter 
thus, an acceptance of our view would weaken our moral fibre, 
in that it would lead us to think less of the import of our past 
acts. This view however I think cannot be seriously de- 
fended, rather must it be maintained that under our view 
these acts of the past acquire for us a new significance. For 
we see that, as we now understand the meaning of responsi- 
bility, we must hold ourselves responsible, not for some, but 
for all of our past acts. We are all too apt to attempt to 
shirk this responsibility; to lay it upon our youth and 
inexperience, upon circumstances and pressure upon us, upon 
temporary conditions of passion. But under our view it 
appears clear that no such shifting of responsibility can be 
allowed to us. My present Self is what it is because of the 
previous existence of the Self that acted in youth and with 
lack of experience, of the Self that allowed itself to be 
influenced to sin by circumstance and pressure from without, 
of the Self that succumbed to the passion of a moment: and 
in my present Self I bear the marks of all these past acts of 
my previous Selves, and cannot ‘‘count out” the effects upon 
me of any single one of them. 
Thus it appears that the view here maintained, far from 
lessening, materially adds to the seriousness of the implication 
of our inner sense of personal responsibility. If it be true 
that we can never cast behind us the effects upon us of our 
acts of the past, we surely must feel enforced within us the 
great importance of careful consideration of each motive to 
action, and must be pressed to strenuous effort to prevent the 
 
-P-A-G-E-651
COROLLARIES 639 
recurrence of deeds such as our past Selves have produced, 
and which we now acknowledge to have been sinful. 
Sec. 11. But it may be held that the current view of the 
personal responsibility of a continuing Self is a most important 
aid to man’s moral regeneration, and of practical benefit, in that 
it leads him to make reparation for the results of his past sins. 
It may be justly claimed however that in this view of ours 
we find a much more efficient aid to one’s moral regeneration, 
and a more urgent pressure to make restitution for the loss 
to one’s fellows of goods or welfare caused by the act of our 
past, but other, Selves. 
The reparation for past sins is called for, under our view, 
in order to truly re-form our Selves ;—to make of them Selves 
of so diverse a type that, not only will they not by their acts 
bring about loss of welfare to our neighbors, but will actually 
bring gain of welfare to them. 
It appears further that effort towards moral regeneration 
is more easily maintained under our view than under a view 
which holds that the same old Self, which in the past worked 
evil to his fellows, remains with us. For under the current 
view this old continuing Self must continue to remain with 
us to all time as it has in the past. What warrant have we, 
under such a view, for belief that this Self, which persists as 
it was, can be so changed that it will not repeat its sins of 
the past, if the same conditions are again given? With 
greater hope, under our view, are we able to maintain that 
the Self of the past which sinned can never recur: that 
although the new Selves to arise will be in part what they are 
because of the existence of the particular Self whose act we 
deplore, and of all other past Selves; nevertheless that each 
future Self will be a new Self which may be so remoulded as 
to be altogether different from the Self that in the past has 
sinned. We see thus no reason for aught but courage in our 
effort towards our moral improvement. Under a view that 
holds the Self to be a permanent, and unchangeable, and
-P-A-G-E-652
  640 COROLLARIES 
persisting, somewhat, one may well be led, beyond remorse, 
to hopelessness and despair: while for us, under our view, 
there is no place for despair, as we realize that the Self of 
each moment must be a new and unique Self, and never the 
same Self as of old; and that its opportunities for improve- 
ment are thus continuous and without limit.

Sec. 1. It is generally found that our definite conceptions 
are based upon certain fairly clear introspective experiences ; 
and the conception of the ‘‘ freedom of the will” is no excep- 
tion to the rule. As we shall presently see it must be granted 
that this notion is valid if it is stated in proper terms; but 
the meaning of the experiences which gives rise to this con- 
ception has been too often misinterpreted, and as a result the 
average man finds himself confronted with certain very 
puzzling philosophical difficulties, which in my view arise 
primarily in connection with the attempt to harmonize the 
current theory of responsibility with the current notion that 
the Self is an unchangeable entity ; and if such is the case 
we may well ask ourselves whether our interpretation of 
responsibility as presented in the preceding pages, and the 
view as to the mutability of the Self which we find ourselves 
led to maintain, serve to remove these difficulties. 
If one holds the common view that the Self that actuates 
a man is an unchanging entity, and if he is led to enquire 
whether our mode of rewarding or punishing an individual 
today for his acts of yesterday is rational, he finds what are 
apparently fairly good reasons for our ordinary procedure if 
he assumes that the acts performed by the man yesterday were 
so undetermined that he could then have acted differently 
than he did; but holding this view he finds no clearly valid 
ground for praise or condemnation if he assumes that the man 
could not have acted otherwise than he did act. At first sight 
this assumption, that the individual could have acted otherwise 
than he did act, seems to find sufficient ground in our experi- 
ence of voluntary choice of which we speak below; and the 
28
-P-A-G-E-654
Oe ee eRe el ee aN ee any Re CT ee Oe ey Ve ean eee eee nee era 
642 COROLLARIES 
common man therefore takes the position that his Self of 
yesterday, remaining the same Self, might have acted differ- 
ently than it did; i.e. that in acting he had a choice which 
was determined by a Self which without change of conditions 
might have acted in either of two contradictory ways, accord- 
ing as it chose to act. 
As President Arthur T. Hadley! well says: ‘‘ The moral 
sense of those who reason about these things today demands 
some distributive fairness in the allotment of rewards and 
punishments. If a man really has a choice this necessity is 
met. To save its sense of justice, while imposing physical 
penalties and preaching moral ones, society asserts the exist- 
ence of such a choice and the responsibility that goes with it. 
These facts go far to explain the teaching and general accept- 
ance of the theory of the freedom of the will. From the 
standpoint of modern science this theory is little short of an 
absurdity. From the standpoint of modern morals it is little 
short of a necessity. The community must compel its mem- 
bers to exercise self-control, and must justify itself for 
punishing them when they fail to exercise it. Both of these 
results are secured by the teaching of the ‘freedom of the 
will?” 
Sec. 2. I think it must be granted that as President 
Hadley puts it “from the standpoint of modern science this 
theory is little short of an absurdity.” For if we agree that 
the events in the natural order are subject to law, and are 
determined in this sense ; and if we agree that man is a part 
of Nature; then we cannot but hold that man’s acts, whether 
instinctive or volitional, are subject to Nature’s laws. From 
this point of view it therefore appears that in his volitional   
1 Freedom and Responsibility, p. 69. Confer also Prof. J. S. Hyslop, 
Mind, N.S, 10. “It is only the question of punishment that can give any 
importance to the freedom of the will and responsibility. Were it not 
for this very practical problem, there would probably be no interest 
attached to the problem.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-655
  COROLLARIES 643 
acts, with which we are here concerned, an individual Self in 
any special moment cannot act otherwise than it does act, 
inasmuch as this Self is part and parcel of the Universe in 
which law prevails. 
Sec. 3. But if on these grounds we are forced to deny that 
a Self of any given moment could act differently than it does 
act, we are brought to face the fact that “‘ from the standpoint 
of modern morals” the defence of this notion “‘is little short 
of a necessity,” to quote again the words of President Hadley. 
So far as I can see it is thus a necessity only because of the 
usual assumption that the Self is an unchanging entity ; for 
resting upon this assumption it justifies itself for punishing 
those who fail to exercise self-control by holding that this 
persistent Self might have acted as it did not act. 
If on the other hand the Self that acts is in each moment 
new and unique, then at once disappears all the cogency of the 
main argument set up for the defence of this ‘‘ scientifically 
absurd” doctrine by those who accept the current basis of the 
doctrine of responsibility. For if a man’s now existing Self is 
not the same as the Self which committed act a in the past, 
then, according to the current conception of the basis of 
responsibility, it appears irrational in any event to reward or 
punish this now existing Self for what was the act of quite 
another Self in the past: and it is therefore of no importance 
whatever, for those, who defend this particular view in relation 
to the doctrine of responsibility, whether this other Self of the 
past could or could not have committed the act 8, instead of 
the incompatible act a which it did commit. 
In either case then we are compelled to find other than the 
current grounds for the enforcement of the notion of personal 
responsibility. That these other grounds are discoverable I 
have endeavored to make clear in the preceding division of 
this chapter: and thus we are left free to consider the real 
questions involved in the “‘free will controversy” without 
any such pressure as is brought to bear upon us so long as we  
-P-A-G-E-656
  644 COROLLARIES 
hold that the doctrine of moral responsibility is necessarily 
based upon the notion that the Self is undetermined in its 
acts. 
Sec. 4. With the ground thus cleared we are better pre- 
pared to deal with the problem before us, which may be 
profitably considered from two points of views by asking, 1st, 
whether the Self, which acts in a certain manner in a given 
moment, could have acted in any other manner in that same 
moment ‘‘had it chosen to do so”; and 2nd, whether the 
Self which acts is free. 
Before we attempt to consider these questions we must 
remind ourselves again that the Self of the man that acts must 
be discriminated from the empirical ego of the man that is 
appreciated as active when he makes a voluntary choice. 
While we may well claim, as we have seen, that the empirical 
ego is a simulacrum of the Self, it seems clear that it is itself 
merely a specially interesting form of the so called presenta- 
tions to the Self. It appears to the writer that the failure to 
keep this distinction in mind is responsible for much of the 
confusion that has entered into the discussion of the subject 
here considered. For where we question whether the Self is 
free, we speak objectively and refer to the true Self of the man 
when he acts: where, on the other hand, we speak of the self as 
“willing” we are usually dealing with states of self-conscious- 
ness, and are referring to the empirical ego which is given as a 
“presentation” to the Self, and which as such appears to be 
efficient in the act of will. This distinction must be borne in 
mind in what follows. 
B 
Sec. 5. When, turning to the first of the two questions 
stated in the opening paragraph of the preceding section, we 
ask whether the Self, which acts in a certain manner in a given 
moment, could have acted in any other manner in that same
-P-A-G-E-657
COROLLARIES 645 
moment ;! we are compelled to face the fact, spoken of in 
Sec. 2 above, that if our Selves are part and parcel of the 
universe in which law appears to prevail, then, just so far as 
the forms of all other parts of Nature are determined, so the 
nature of my Self and its forms of functioning must be deter- 
mined. It is to be acknowledged of course that this notion of 
the determination of Nature to act in accordance with law is 
itself an assumption based upon our general experience which 
in the nature of the case cannot be more than limited: but if 
we grant the validity of this assumption, as most men do, then 
it appears that the nature of each Self of each moment, as part 
of the Universe, must be determined, and that its mode of 
action must in like manner be determined. 
What Prest. Hadley calls the ‘‘absurdity” of the indeter- 
minist position stands out even more clearly if we shift to some 
extent our point of view. And here it must be noted that we 
are forced to deal with one of those difficulties which we make 
for ourselves by using our terms carelessly. The word free- 
dom is employed by us commonly to indicate lack of restraint, 
while at other times it is used to indicate the possibility of the 
choice of either one of two incompatibles ; and in most discus- 
sions of this subject the contestants shift from one of these 
meanings to the other with little hesitation.? 
Modern psychologists recognize very generally that while it 
is at times convenient, it is not scientifically accurate, to speak 
of “the will” as though it were in itself an entity. What we 
really refer to when we speak of the ‘‘ freedom of the will,” is 
1 Some reader who has in mind the arguments of others, especially those 
»- Edwards in his Freedom of the Will, may think it unnecessary for me to 
lead him over this well-trodden ground ; but evidently Edwards approached 
the question from a standpoint very different from ours, and, as I have 
said aboye, the problem gains new meaning in connection with the thesis 
of the mutability of the Self here maintained. 
2 Confer Prof, Fullerton’s article on “Freedom and Free Will,” Popular 
Science Monthly, Dec. 1900, Confer also Hume’s Human Understanding, 
sec. 8, last sentence of part i.
-P-A-G-E-658
646 COROLLARIES 
the freedom of the individual man in an act of willing. As 
Locke’ put it long ago “the question is not proper whether 
the will be free, but whether a man be free.” If, with such an 
understanding we contend that the will is free, then we mean 
to claim that the man who wills is free in his willing; and this, 
if stated in other words, means simply that the Self is free to 
act, and always does act, in accord with its own essential nature, 
as that is at the moment of the act. If then I am able at any 
given moment to perform act a, and in so doing am free to 
act in accord with the nature of my Self, then evidently I 
cannot in this same moment be able to perform act 8 which is 
incompatible with act a, while still remaining free. For if I 
could perform act 8, I should not be acting in accord with the 
nature of my Self of the moment, and should therefore act 
under compulsion, i.e. without freedom. 
It would thus appear that under this view we must accept 
one of two alternatives ; we must either abandon the notion 
that the Self is always free to act in accord with its own nature, 
or else the notion that in any moment it can act otherwise than 
it does act. But there are strong reasons, as we have seen, 
why we should abandon the latter position, and we therefore 
do not find ourselves led by this consideration to abandon our 
belief in the freedom of the Self to act in accord with its own 
nature, of which we speak more at length in the third division 
below. 
Sec. 6. But we cannot leave this first question with so 
simple a statement as this. If such an argument is to carry 
conviction it will be necessary to present some adequate ex- 
planation of the fact that so many thoughtful people have 
found themselves constrained to uphold the doctrine that in 
any moment of action the Self, had it so chosen, might have 
acted in a different way than it did act, and that such a possi- 
bility is of the essence of the Self’s freedom. 
Here it is to be noted that we appeal to the sense of lack of 
1 Essay, etc. book ii, ch. xxi. sec. 21.
-P-A-G-E-659
  COROLLARIES 647 
restraint in evidence of the possibility of indeterminate action. 
Bearing in mind the confusion of language above referred to 
let us examine the evidence of an introspective nature which 
seems to warrant the contention of those whose position we 
oppose, who are wont to hold that the Self in any moment of 
action might have acted differently than it did act, mainly on 
three grounds. rst, Because we have the experience of being 
in doubt as to which of two incompatible acts we shall will ; 
and a sense of choice between the two; with a conviction, 
after the act, that we had the power to choose the one not 
chosen. 2nd, Because we experience within ourselves a sense 
of freedom in willing. 3rd, Because we feel a sense of respon- 
sibility for our acts in the past which we would not feel were 
we not assured that either of the alternatives might have been 
chosen. 
Sec. 7. We may dismiss at once with few words the third 
point just stated in consideration of what has been said in 
Sec. 3 above, and in the preceding divisions of this chapter, 
where we have shown ; ist, that the doctrine of responsibility 
cannot be properly based upon the notion weare here consider- 
ing, if it be held that the Self in each moment is a new and 
unique Self, as we contend ; and 2nd, that a perfectly adequate 
and more satisfactory basis for the doctrine of responsibility is 
found which has no reference to the notion that the acts of the 
Self are undetermined. 
Sec. 8. We may turn then to the consideration of the 
claim, the justice of which must be acknowledged, that, whether 
the argument from responsibility above discussed is valid or 
not, it could not have been made did not men have experiences 
which lead them to agree that they are often in doubt as to 
which of two incompatible acts they are about to will, and did 
they not have a conviction after the act, that they had the 
power to choose the act which they did not choose. 
This experience we cannot afford to overlook. But when we 
study it with care we at once see that we are here considering
-P-A-G-E-660
648 COROLLARIES 
evidence gained in states of self-consciousness in which we 
deal not with the Self, but with the empirical ego; and it 
is clear that the experience here referred to must be very 
differently interpreted if one holds that there is a permanent 
Self which is in some manner given in self-consciousness, and 
which is referred to in this experience of hesitancy, and choice, 
and conviction of lack of determination ; or if one holds, as 
we do, that the ego of self-consciousness is not in any sense the 
true Self, but is merely a special form of ‘‘ presentation” to the 
Self, viz.: is an empirical ego which is itself in each moment 
new and unique. 
The interpretation of the facts here under consideration, as 
given above, is clearly based upon what we hold to be the 
false notion that there is a permanent Self which acts, now in 
one way, and now in another. In thus interpreting our experi- 
ence we think of the same Self being in doubt, and actually 
deciding to do one of the two incompatible acts, and then 
looking back and thinking that, had it chosen, it might have 
performed the other of the incompatible acts. 
But under our view these experiences must be interpreted 
quite differently, and as follows. We often note in experi- 
ence, in rapid succession, diverse empirical egos which appear 
as about to emphasize elements of a given object which are 
incompatible with one another. These diverse empirical egos 
may have many elements in common, but that they are 
appreciated to be diverse empirical egos cannot be doubted by 
one who has followed our thought in Chapter xxvi. As such 
diverse egos they may even appear to co-exist ; we actually 
think of them often as standing over against one another, as 
when we speak of one as a ‘‘ better self” than the other. 
Quite apart from the claim that each empirical ego must be 
new and unique, it seems clear that such empirical egos as we 
are here describing are altogether diverse in the very fact that, 
if practically the very same object is given to each of them, 
each tends to react differently upon the object. As one of  
-P-A-G-E-661
COROLLARIES 649 
these empirical egos is about to act upon the given object by 
the emphasis of certain of its elements, its action is inhibited 
by the appearance of the other empirical ego which tends to 
act upon the object by the emphasis of quite incompatible 
elements. Finally one of these empirical egos does act,— 
becomes effective,—and then in the “‘ act of will” the deadlock 
is broken. We then look back in retrospect and see the two 
empirical egos in contrast, and we realize that one of them did 
act in a certain way, and that if the other had acted it would 
have acted in a quite incompatible way." 
Thus far we have been dealing with introspective facts which 
cannot be denied. At this point however we are wont to be 
obfuscated by the intrusion of our usual but unwarranted 
assumption of a permanent Self of which both of these em- 
pirical egos are equally representative ; and we say that the 
Self might have performed either of these two incompatible 
acts; and in the fact that it did the one and not the other, 
while it did “choose” the one it might just as well have 
chosen the other. But clearly this conclusion is altogether 
unwarranted, for the simple reason that if our view is correct 
neither of these empirical egos is representative of a per- 
sistent Self: they are diverse “‘ presentations” to the Self of 
the moment of reflection ; and they themselves are each new 
and unique “‘ presentations” in any event, whether or not it is 
agreed that the Self of each moment is a new and unique Self. 
The notion of freedom, understood as the ability of the same 
Self to act in either of one of two incompatible ways, clearly 
finds no confirmation then in the misinterpreted introspective 
1 Confer Bradley (Mind, N.S. 43, p. 306). “Moving ideas A and B” 
(incompatibles) “cannot, while really taken thus as alternative, be present 
together, and we are able to think this possible only because we really 
do not take them as opposites. We, for the moment, may merely ignore 
their reciprocal exclusion, or we more or less consciously may fancy some 
wider arrangement in which they cease to conflict. But while each appears 
simply and unconditionally as containing the negatives of the other, I am 
confident that both practical ideas, as ideas, do not come before us at once.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-662
50 COROLLARIES 
experience above described, which in any event relates not to 
the Self but to empirical egos ; and it surely cannot therefore 
be said that the indeterminist’s position is substantiated by 
any such appeal to introspection as that here considered. 
Sec. 9. But the third point mentioned at the close of 
Sec. 6 above may still be urged in favor of the view we here 
oppose ; viz. the fact that we certainly have an immediate sense 
of freedom in the act of willing. This I not only would not 
deny, but would myself affirm. Yet I would hold that this 
fact has no direct relation to the question as to freedom, if we 
use that term as opposed to necessity, which is the real point 
now at issue. It has relation only to the question of freedom 
where the term is used as opposed to restraint. 
Granting that we appreciate a sense of freedom in the act of 
willing, this fact throws no light whatever upon the question 
whether we could have willed what we did not will, as becomes 
clear when we note that had we willed what we did not will, 
we would have experienced the very same sense of freedom in 
connection with the will act. When we appeal to the experi- 
ence of the sense of freedom in the will act we are merely 
referring to the fact that a self-conscious act of will always 
follows an inhibition due to opposed tendencies; and that 
with such an act, whichever of the two tendencies prevails, 
must go the sense of relief from strain which in common 
language is spoken of as the joy of liberty or freedom. But 
evidently the freedom thus referred to is not the indeterminate 
freedom of the Self which we have here under discussion.! 
1Jn this connection I may call attention to the view of Prof. Charles A. 
Strong (Journal of Philosophy, etc. 1. 5, p. 127), who, in somewhat the same 
vein, has held that “the consciousness of freedom arises when alternative 
courses of action are weighed against each other. Neither is strong enough 
to draw us automatically in its direction ; if it were there would be no 
deliberation, and only in deliberation can there be a sense of freedom. We 
are free to choose either course ; that is with reference to neither are we 
forcibly led captive by the other... . Freedom is the opposite of 
bondage. ‘The bondage is to any thought of action that determines the 
act automatically.”
-P-A-G-E-663

Cc 
Sec. 10. If now we turn to the second of the questions as 
referred to in Sec. 4, and ask whether the Self which acts is 
always free to act in accord with its own essential nature, we 
must at first note that in speaking of this freedom of the Self 
we cannot refer to a hypothetical condition in which the will 
act arises without cause. That this is the essence of volitional 
freedom has indeed often been, and is still implicitly main- 
tained by those who do not think clearly : but surely there has 
been no excuse for clinging to any such notion since Edwards 
| wrote his famous essay. 
Now can we hold that volitional freedom fails us if obstacles 
inhibit the fruition of the will act. We surely see no reason 
to uphold such a view when these obstacles are in the world 
without us ; and careful consideration convinces us there is as 
little reason to maintain this view when the obstacles are found 
in the nature of the “‘ psychical dispositions” which we have 
inherited from our ancestors, or which have been produced by 
our previous experiences inclusive of our previous volitions. 
The freedom of which we enquire must belong to the Self 
in the moment of the will act, and if we assert this to exist we 
can mean nothing other than that in each case of willing the 
Self acts in accord with what is its essential nature at the 
moment of action. 
In considering the question before us in the light of our 
view as to the mutability of the Self, we may note in the first 
place that, if the Self in each moment is a new and unique Self, 
we may hold that the Self is free in the sense here considered 
without taking a position in opposition to those who hold that 
the acts of the Self as part of Nature are in each moment 
determined in one, and only one direction. For we may hold 
that when the Self performs act a it is a new and unique Self 
of a special kind which we may call A; and that if it had 
performed act 8 which is incompatible with a it would have
-P-A-G-E-664
  652 COROLLARIES 
been a new and unique Self B, which would have differed 
from A. And it is clear that this does not in any way lead us 
to deny that each of these Selves A and B, when they act, are 
free to act in accord with their essential and diverse natures. 
And when we turn to the main question, whether the Self, 
when it acts, is really thus always free to act in accord with its 
innermost nature, we find ourselves forced to give an affirma- 
tive answer. For as we have seen the Self is part and parcel 
of the whole psychic system of consciousness in any given 
moment. As such it is always efficient in some measure in 
giving the form to the noetic pattern of the moment ; and it 
is thus efficient because its nature defines the mode of its action 
upon the rest of this noetic pattern of the moment. 
Environmental influences as involving momentary psychic 
emphases, and pre-existing “psychical dispositions,” also 
always have to do with the form which is given to the noetic 
pattern of a given moment, and their psychic resultants are 
also efficient because their nature defines the mode of their 
action upon the noetic pattern of the moment. Thus we may 
truly say, not only of the Self, but of each part of conscious- 
ness, that so far as it is efficient it is free in the sense that it acts 
in accord with its own innermost nature. 
There are cases, as we all know, where the psychic resultant 
of these environmental influences, or of these pre-existing 
“psychical dispositions,” appear to be alone efficient in giving 
form to the noetic pattern of the moment ; and in such cases, 
while the ‘‘ presentations” given in attention appear to be free 
to act in accord with their own nature, the Self seems to us to 
be inefficient, and lacking in freedom. But evidently this 
appearance must be illusory: for the Self being part of the 
consciousness of the moment must, even in such cases, always 
have its part in the forming of the noetic pattern; it must 
always tend to assimilate or not to assimilate what is given to 
it; it must always either welcome or reject the form of em- 
phasis which thus appears to us to be forced upon it, and in 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-665

thus acting it must always act in accord with its own » essential 
nature: i.e. with freedom, in the sense in which this freedom 
of the Self is here considered. 
The form of the noetic pattern of any moment, as odjec- 
tively viewed, is determined as all situations in nature are 
determined ; and this involves the determination, in this 
objective sense, of the nature of the Self which is part of the 
noetic pattern of the moment. But on the other hand, as 
subjectively viewed, the Self within the noetic pattern must 
necessarily react in accordance with its own nature, just as all 
other parts of the noetic pattern act. 
Sec. 11. Evidently then if a Self as thus conceived acts to 
emphasize one of two incompatible ‘‘ presentations,” and in a 
manner that is determined, it does so only because it is free to 
act according to its own innermost nature, which itself is 
determined. Just as evidently if, in the moment in question 
and remaining unchanged, it had acted to emphasize the other 
of the two incompatible ‘‘ presentations” it would have acted 
not in accordance with its own innermost nature, but in some 
other way ; and clearly then it would no longer have been free 
in its action, but would have been restrained from its freedom 
because forced to act ina manner not in accord with its nature. 
But if we once agree to the doctrine that the Self is at each 
moment new and unique, then we may hold that, as the Self 
of an individual man changes from moment to moment, two 
Selves may be developed in succession in the same individual : 
one of which would act, with freedom, to emphasize one of 
two incompatible ‘‘ presentations” ; and the other of which 
would act, also with freedom, to emphasize the other of the 
two incompatible ‘‘ presentations.” Under this view therefore 
we are under no compulsion to deny the real freedom of each 
Self to act in accord with its innermost nature, when we appeal 
to the experience, considered in Sec. 8 above, of the sense of 
two empirical egos as contending together for the mastery : 
and this experience itself, upon which mainly is founded our
-P-A-G-E-666
654 COROLLARIES 
notion of the doctrine of freedom as usually improperly stated, 
is found, as we have seen, to be altogether in harmony with the 
conception of the real freedom of the ever changing Self ; 
while it is not thus in harmony if we look upon the Self as a 
persistent unchanging entity, the nature of which is reflected 
in these two empirical egos given in self-consciousness. 
D 
Sec. 12. We are led here to consider an important ques- 
tion which does not seem to me to receive in our day the 
attention it deserves. It is a very old one, as the reader will 
recognize, but one which in the light of modern psychological 
development appears ina new form. It has been overlooked, 
or glossed over, by those who should have seen in it ample 
reason to modify theoretical positions of great importance. 
We all recognize in ourselves the experience which leads us 
to acknowledge that at times we have erred, that at times we 
have sinned ; or in other words we agree that we, like all other 
men, have acted voluntarily in ways which in retrospect appear 
to have been irrational. We acknowledge this without hesita- 
tion but, strange to say, without asking ourselves how this can 
be true if the Self is conceived as a persistent entity, which 
acts voluntarily, and is at the same time free to act in accord- 
ance with its own essential nature. For if it be true that a 
persistent Self wills irrationally, and if that Self is free in its 
voluntary acts, and if its freedom involves action in accord 
with its essential nature, then evidently a Self may under cer- 
tain conditions be irrational in its essential nature, for thus 
alone can its willing be an irrational willing. 
Such a view as to the nature of the Self cannot be pleasing to 
any of us, and must be especially distasteful to those idealistic 
metaphysicians who are wont now-a-days to teach that Will is 
in its very essence rational. Nor can such a view appeal to the 
introspective psychologist who is wont to assume what I
-P-A-G-E-667
COROLLARIES 655 
believe to be true, as I have attempted to show in earlier 
chapters of this book and in my Instinct and Reason, viz. = 
that the natural outcome of the process of reasoning is a voli- 
tional act ; and that the antecedent to the volitional act always 
appears to be implicitly of the general form which becomes 
explicit in clearly defined ratiocinative process. Thus I am 
led to hold that all volitional acts are necessarily rational acts 
at the moment of their occurrence. 
Sec. 13. It is of course clear enough that we recognize in 
ourselves what we call ‘‘unreasonable action”; but as we 
have just said it is not easy to see how voluntary irrationality 
can be compatible with our views as to the nature of ration- 
ality, and at the same time compatible with the thesis that the 
Self which is assumed to be active in this volition is always 
free to act in accordance with its own essential nature. 
Now it appears to me that the difficulty thus presented is 
entirely based upon the prevalent, and as I hold fallacious, view 
that the Self is a persistent entity ; and that it is solved at once 
if we accept the views here defended; 1st, that the Self of 
each moment is new and unique; and 2nd, that voluntary 
action involves the appreciation, not of the act of the Self, but 
of the act of an empirical ego which itself is also in each 
moment new and unique. 
At this juncture it must be noted that if we state that the 
Self does ever act voluntarily and irrationally, i.e. does ever 
err or sin, and then appeal to our self-conscious states to corro- 
borate this statement, we are not presenting effective evidence, 
for it is not the Self that is given in self-consciousness as acting 
voluntarily, but the empirical ego. Yet even if it be held that 
it is really the Self, although perhaps represented in the em- 
pirical ego, that acts in what we know in self-conscious states 
as volition ; even so, if it is held, as I have argued above, that 
each voluntary act of the Self is rational, and that the Self thus 
acting is free to express its essential nature ; then clearly we 
must deny that a Self ever does in fact act voluntarily and at  
-P-A-G-E-668
  656 COROLLARIES 
the same time irrationally, i.e. that a Self ever does err or 
sin. 
Or suppose we state the matter in accord with the view that 
it is not the Self, but the active empirical ego, that is appreci- 
ated in our voluntary acts. This empirical ego under our 
view is a simulacrum of the Self, and has the characteristics 
which lead us to describe the Self as rational ; and it, like all 
parts of consciousness, acts in accordance with its essential 
nature, and hence with freedom. But if it be held that each 
voluntary act is rational, and that the empirical ego thus acting 
is free to express its essential nature; then again we are 
brought to see that we must hold that we in our self-conscious 
states never do in fact act voluntarily and at the same time 
irrationally ; i.e. that we never do err or sin." 
Strange as this statement may sound to some readers I 
believe it must be held to be true: but I hasten to add that 
this assertion contains no denial of the fact that we recognize 
that we have sinned or have erred. 
It is perfectly true that, if we hold that the Self as repre- 
sented by the empirical ego is a persistent entity, it is impos- 
sible to assert that a Self can never act voluntarily, and at the 
same time irrationally, without having our assertion com- 
batted by the clear consciousness of our own sins and errors. 
But, if we agree that each Self at each moment is new and 
unique, and that each empirical ego at each moment is new and 
unique, then we do not find the least difficulty in harmonizing 
this assertion with our experience. For we are able to explain 
that the empirical ego always, in acting voluntarily, acts also 
rationally ; but that nevertheless an empirical ego, or an 
imagined self, may be recalled which in acting freely and 
rationally, acted in a manner which would be irrational for the 
Self, or for the empirical ego, of the moment in which this 
1Cf. Bradley, Mind, N.S. 43, p. 307. “If I acted knowingly for the 
bad, the bad must ipso facto have become good, and otherwise the act 
would certainly not be my volition.”
-P-A-G-E-669
  COROLLARIES 657 
recall occurs. We merely assert then that the recognitions of 
error and sin are recognitions of what is past; are due to a 
comparison of the acts of a past Self, which are represented in 
reflection by the acts of an empirical ego of a diverse nature 
from the Self, and from the empirical ego, of the moment of 
reflection ;—of a past empirical ego which at the moment of 
its existence, freely and rationally, willed an act which the 
diverse empirical ego of the moment of comparison, in its 
freedom, could not will: and thus it is that we recognize that 
we have erred and have sinned; that we have acted ina manner 
which, if we could now act thus, would be irrational, and not 
in accord with the nature of the empirical ego of the moment, 
nor in accord with the nature of the Self of the moment as this 
Self is conceived. 
When we look forward and say that if we act in a certain 
way we shall err or sin, the process is fundamentally the same ; 
for then we picture to ourselves a Self acting freely in accord- 
ance with its own nature, but in a manner that would be 
irrational for the Self of the moment of comparison, i.e. in a 
manner that would involve this present Self’s acting in contra- 
diction with its own essential nature. 
Under such a view this whole difficulty turns upon the fact 
that the notion of erring and sinning is an illusion due to our 
inveterate bad habit of dealing with retrospective acts as if 
they were occurring in the present moment. When we seem 
to catch ourselves in the act of sinning, or erring in the broader 
sense, we overlook the rapid transition between the actual 
rational experience in the act, and the experience of having 
acted, or of imagining ourselves acting. 
It is to be noted here that if it were true that we experienced 
ourselyes as souls in bondage acting irrationally, i.e. as 
sinning ; this fact would have little ethical significance. It is 
the recognition that we have sinned that induces repentance, 
in which lies our hope of moral regeneration. 
In April, 1893, Professor Henry Sidgwick published in 
2T
-P-A-G-E-670
  658 COROLLARIES 
Mind a searching investigation of what he called “‘unreason- 
able action.” This was later republished in his Practical 
Ethics. 1 shall hope that the interested student will read this 
paper carefully, as the analysis there given is an almost com- 
plete vindication of the views here presented. In Mind for 
January, 1894, I made a reply, the substance of which is 
republished in my Instinct and Reason (p. 418 ff.), in which 
I attempted to show that if Prof. Sidgwick carried his thought 
to its legitimate conclusion he would find it necessary to main- 
tain the position above upheld. The question was there 
considered without any reference to the thesis as to the muta- 
bility of the Self, which gives us further ground for defence 
of this position. 
Sec. 14. Here again then we perceive that a formidable 
difficulty disappears if we once acknowledge that the free Self 
is ever a new and unique Self. What can we mean by saying 
that I can either sin, or not sin, if I am an ever persistent 
unchanging Self, and withal a free Self. How can my Self, 
as objectively considered, at one time sin, acting freely in 
accord with its innermost nature; and at another time not 
sin, also acting freely in accord with its innermost nature which 
remains unchanged. No; the very fact that we recognize 
thus objectively that we have sinned is a witness to the truth 
that each free Self must at each moment be a new Self. For 
it is certain, if the Self is free, that it acted when it sinned in 
accord with its innermost nature ; and it is equally true that 
it acted when it did not sin in accord with its innermost 
nature ; and as the acts of sinning, and of not sinning, are 
incompatible acts, it must be because the free Selves at the 
moment of these diverse actions were diverse Selves. We 
are thus led to see still more clearly that the Self has at all 
times true freedom to express its own innermost nature in 
each act of will, and this only because we have learned to see 
clearly that each Self must be new and unique.

Of those who read the pages to follow, there are not un- 
likely to be some who, led by their deep and sincere interest 
in the subject to be treated, will turn to them without a careful 
study of what has preceded them; and without the special 
training necessary to enable them to comprehend the intention 
of my argument, or such significance as it may have. 
To such readers I may say that they will find nothing what- 
ever in what follows that can be read with profit by any who 
are not fully acquainted with the present status of psychological 
discussion. 
We deal here with a highly technical analysis of certain 
concepts from the psychologist’s standpoint ; and attempt to 
indicate wherein they lack consistency and require restate- 
ment. So far as this restatement is attempted it is regarded 
by the writer as purely tentative, and as in no sense mini- 
mizing the deep significance of the concepts with which it 
deals ; concepts which have broader than mere psychological 
bearings, and which must ever ennoble the lives of those who 
interpret them aright. 
A 
Sec. 1. Few readers of the preceding chapter can, I 
imagine, have failed to ask themselves whether the doctrine 
of the mutability of the empirical ego and of the Self which 
is there defended is compatible with the conception of the 
immortality of the soul which has in the past been, and is still, 
commonly held as a cherished and sacred belief by the very 
noblest of men and women. 
No serious writer can touch upon this subject without 
hesitancy, for he must realize the danger of misinterpretation 
 
-P-A-G-E-672
660 COROLLARIES 
and misconstruction on the part of those who have failed to 
gain his own point of view; and must dread the results to 
follow from an imperfect comprehension of his position by 
those whose faith in a deeply significant doctrine may be too 
easily shaken, without the compensating gain of conceptions 
equally significant and satisfying. And he must feel a greater 
hesitancy if he is convinced, as I am, that conceptions which 
have gained that realness that leads the common man to call 
them established beliefs, and which have maintained this real- 
ness for the best and most intelligent of men during long 
ages, must certainly express fundamental truths of value to 
mankind. ‘This we may hold even though we acknowledge 
that in these conceptions the truths involved are but inade- 
quately expressed, and are commonly misinterpreted. 
But those who follow me in my general views must agree 
that human thought can in any event express only approxi- 
mately the full truth ; and that the conceptions current in any 
period must be modified in future ages, if with advancing 
knowledge they are to continue to appeal to men as true. 
The most that we can hope is that, as our knowledge increases, 
and as our conceptions alter, the approximation to truth 
expressed in these conceptions will become closer ; and that, 
as we develope, these conceptions will more and more nearly 
represent what is wholly true. 
If this position is accepted then it must be agreed that for 
those who appreciate the seriousness of life it is a duty to face 
from time to time the problem of the re-expression of truths 
which come to them clothed, as it were, in conceptions, in 
dogmas, in what men call fundamental beliefs, which never- 
theless give rise to questionings drawing attention to their 
inadequacy as such expressions of truth. 
One cannot properly undertake such a task however with- 
out a full recognition of the fact that such re-expression as 
he attempts to make may prove to be utterly inadequate. 
Where a given expression of a truth has persisted long, it is
-P-A-G-E-673
COROLLARIES 661 
certain that in many respects it has proved adequate; and 
before we can hope to gain a new conception the acceptance 
of which may justly be urged in its place, many an attempted 
re-expression must surely be expected to be found unsatis- 
factory in unforeseen particulars. 
It is in this spirit that I undertake to consider the problem 
before us. 
Sec. 2. It will be well for us in the beginning to ask 
ourselves what aspects of the problem we are in any way bound 
to treat in connection with the studies made in the preceding 
chapters; and what, if any, we may properly leave uncon- 
sidered. 
We have dealt with the nature of consciousness, and of the 
empirical ego and the Self as parts of consciousness ; and the 
general thesis of psychic mutability which we have emphasized 
in the preceding pages, so far as it has reference to our present 
problem, has related only to the empirical ego and to the Self 
of the experience of successive moments as such parts of 
consciousness. 
If it be true, as may perhaps be well claimed, that the 
problem of the immortality of the soul is a broader problem 
than that relating to experience as such ; if it be true that the 
problem is one in connection with which metaphysical con- 
siderations, other than those of which we have there incident- 
ally taken account, are of essential importance ; then it must 
be agreed that we are not prepared to deal with these broader, 
these metaphysical, considerations by the studies recorded in 
these pages. We are warranted therefore in treating only of 
such limited aspects of the problem before us as bear distinct 
relation to the nature of consciousness as we have considered 
it: and these limitations I accept. What I shall have to say 
in what follows may well be but a partial expression of a 
broader truth, even if as such a partial expression it is accepted 
as adequate. 
Nevertheless I think it will become clear as we proceed
-P-A-G-E-674
re ee ee rs eR eee Se eye regs 
662 COROLLARIES 
that the form of the problem with which we are, or should 
be, prepared to deal, is the only form of it in which the 
questions involved come before the average man for his 
consideration. 
B 
Sec. 3. The current conception of the immortality of the 
soul has an ancient lineage, and _in all probability was derived 
from, and as an extension and refinement of, the ancient 
animistic view which assumed the existence of a “‘ spirit” that 
dwelt in a man’s body during waking life, that left it tem- 
porarily during sleep, that might under certain conditions be 
displaced by some alien spirit when the man’s body was said 
to be “ possessed,” and that finally left it for good and all at 
his death. Most naturally those who held what seems to us 
today so crude a view were led to assume that the spirit at 
death continued its existence outside of the body, as it was 
believed to exist apart from the body during sleep. 
The derivation of the word spirit shows us that it was 
originally identified with the breath of life; and such an 
identification would for us be crassly materialistic. We are 
thus too ready to assume that those who first conceived the 
distinction between matter and spirit were thinking in terms 
of modern materialism. 
When however we put ourselves in the place of the men 
of old we perceive that this warm, vital, breath must have 
seemed to them to be a type of existence entirely diverse 
from the hard, and ponderable, and measurable matter with 
which their daily activities made them familiar. And then 
we are led to see that in this ancient distinction we probably 
have the record of the primitive form of that introspective 
experience upon which are based all our more explicit idealistic 
systems, as these are distinguished from the materialistic. 
That the word spirit does however retain something like 
a materialistic connotation among the less intelligent of our 
   
-P-A-G-E-675
EE 
COROLLARIES 663 
own time cannot be doubted when we consider the still per- 
sisting belief in “‘ ghosts,” and in “‘astral bodies” ; nor can 
the more intelligent be said to have freed themselves entirely 
from this materialism so long as they are content to describe 
the tenet of immortality asa belief in eternal life. 
We may take it for granted nevertheless that most men 
of intelligence now-a-days will be unwilling to grant that 
they refer to anything of the nature of a material entity when 
they think of an immortal spirit; and we are therefore led 
to ask what meaning they actually do attribute to the word 
in this connection. 
They will agree I think that the spirit of a man is an 
individual entity of a psychic nature; that its existence is 
evidenced during the life of the individual in connection with 
the activities of his body, both voluntary and involuntary ; 
that its existence is not evidenced objectively during deep 
slumber; and that all direct evidence of its existence dis- 
appears with the stillness of death. But this description 
applies also to what we call consciousness, and I think that 
it must be agreed that when the average man who would 
cast aside the materialistic conception speaks of an individual 
spirit he refers to an individual consciousness, or to something 
within such a consciousness. 
If he declines to agree, as he is very likely to do, that the 
spirit of a man includes what are usually described by psycho- 
logists as the presentations within the field of attention of 
the individual consciousness, then we must believe that he 
refers to what is commonly thought of in his self-conscious 
states as that to which these presentations accrue,—to what 
in ordinary life he identifies with that special complex pre- 
sentation which we have described as the empirical ego, and 
which we have claimed to be a simulacrum of the non- 
presentable Self. 
Or if he does not refer to this empirical ego as directly 
experienced, he refers to what we have called the conceptual
-P-A-G-E-676
664 COROLLARIES 
empirical ego, a concept based upon his experience in reflec- 
tion of the revivals of successive empirical egos. 
That we are correct in this view is shown in the fact, which 
cannot be questioned, that he refers to something that is of 
the essence of the individual’s character as objectively viewed, 
and that is efficient in relation to his field of presentations 
in attention, and that has the attachment to the man’s past 
conscious experiences which constitutes memory : all of which 
points to an identification of the ‘‘ spirit” with the conceived 
empirical ego of the individual, the persistence of which 
during life is assured to the common man by his experience 
of the “‘sense of personal identity” in connection with his 
appreciation of successive empirical egos. 
All this becomes clearer when we note that the common 
man has no interest whatever in any hypothetical monad-like 
entity, apart from the every day experience of life, such as 
the Self is held by some to be. We may as we have seen 
assume, if we choose, that the objectively judged alterations 
in the Self, as represented in the subjectively observed altera- 
tions in the empirical ego, are merely changing characteristics 
which cluster around what we may call a quasi punctual core : 
and may assume that this core continues to exist permanently ; 
and that around it ever new characteristics may cluster to all 
eternity. But for such a metaphysical entity the common 
man cares nothing whatever. He will not even trouble him- 
self to enquire whether he believes in its existence or not. 
What he asks for is the persistence of a ful] blooded thing, 
if we may so speak. What he wishes to have persist, so far 
as he himself is concerned, is the psychic entity that he finds 
bound up with his daily conscious experience ; and as far as 
his friend is concerned, he wishes the persistence of that which 
is effective in the constitution of the active living individual, 
—appreciating thinking, loving, and striving.’

We are therefore prepared to state our problem as follows. 
Can we properly hold that the empirical ego of a man, or 
his Self of which this empirical ego is a simulacrum, persists 
eternally? We thus again, and here very clearly, see that 
the theses maintained above as to the mutability of the 
empirical ego, and of the Self, have direct relation to the 
problem of immortality as it is held by the common man. 
Cc 
Sec. 4. But when we consider the nature of this supposed 
persistent entity which we thus identify with the empirical 
ego, and note how changeable the empirical egos of an indi- 
vidual man are, how interesting some, how distasteful others ; 
and when we note further that many of our own empirical 
egos of the past are of so unsatisfactory a nature that in 
retrospect we set them over against what we call our ‘‘ better 
selves”: then we are led to enquire whether that which we 
desire to have persist is anything like an average of these 
experienced empirical egos. And rejecting this notion, as we 
must, we are led further to ask whether any one of these 
specific empirical egos of the individual in all its complexity 
is the one that we wish to have persist. And then we perceive 
that even the very best of these empirical egos, as viewed in 
retrospect if it is one’s own, or as conceived of as existing 
in our friend, has in it, notwithstanding its perfections, some- 
thing of evil or weakness which we would fain eliminate. 
And then taking a step further we see that the individual 
empirical ego which we desire to have persist eternally is one 
or thinker’? My pronoun I? My subjectivity as such? My nucleus 
of cephalic adjustments? or my more phenomenal and perishable powers, 
my loves and hates, willingnesses and sensibilities and the like? But they, 
relatively to the central principle, whatever it may be, are external and 
objective. They come and go, and it remains,—‘so stands the magnet, 
and so stands the pole.’ It may have to be there to be loved, but being 
there is not identical with being loved itself.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-678
    666 COROLLARIES 
that never in fact has actually existed, but is really an ideal 
which we have constructed from our experience of our own 
empirical egos in the one case, and from our conception of 
the varied empirical egos of our friends in the other case ;— 
an ideal produced by the inclusion of all those qualities which 
in ourselves, or in our friends, we find satisfying and lovable ; 
and by the elimination of all those unsatisfactory and unloy- 
able qualities which in some measure attach to all our own 
experienced egos, and to each and every empirical ego of the 
friend whose individuality we wish to believe may persist 
eternally. 
For what justification have we for assuming the persistence 
of the most perfect form of the conceived self as we imagine 
it to have existed in any given moment, rather than that of 
any other such conceived self which we must agree to have 
belonged, as it were, to the individual in whom we are 
interested? Why not hope for the persistence of the con- 
ceived self of the child’s impulsive and ungoverned youth, 
or of the aged man’s infirmity and senility, as well as for the 
persistence of the conceived self of the man in his prime, 
with all his characteristics of strength and lovableness, as we 
do? Why should we hope that this special phase of his indi- 
vidual existence which we delight to recall should go on 
developing to higher perfection through eternity, and close 
our eyes to the existence of the undeveloped and deteriorated 
conceived selves which have belonged to the same individual ? 
Sec. 5. To the difficulty above presented we find added 
one at least equally formidable if we ask ourselves what we 
mean by this individual entity which we desire to have per- 
sist ; and if we come to the conclusion! that the term indi- 
vidual can have no meaning without an implicit recognition 
of a system in which the individual inheres ;—that an indi- 
vidual entity is merely a special minor system within a broader 
system, which minor system is at the moment considered in 
1Confer chapter vii. sec. 7.
-P-A-G-E-679
COROLLARIES 667 
and for itself: and if in addition to this we note the change- 
ableness of systems in general, and the well recognized 
changeableness of psychic systems in particular; and then 
consider that this changeableness must alter the nature of. the 
individuals within these systems in general, and in particular 
any individual existences within conceived conscious systems. 
The difficulty in our attempt to clarify the conception 
here considered is emphasized most markedly however in 
connection with the view which we are here especially con- 
sidering, according to which it appears that no noetic pattern 
can ever be exactly reproduced, that each must be new and 
unique ; and that the Self, and the empirical ego, must in 
each moment be a new and unique Self, and a new and unique 
empirical ego. 
Sec. 6. It would thus appear that the every day concep- 
tion of the eternal existence of a human soul is found to be 
self contradictory, or devoid of meaning ; and therefore that 
it can be truly said that the problem it sets for us lacks all 
significance from a theoretical point of view; so far as it 
relates to the conceptions considered in this book. 
It may be true indeed, as I have suggested above, that 
the conception of the immortality of the soul may involve 
a truth which can only be properly considered from other than 
the psychological standpoint, and that when thus considered 
it appears self-consistent, and full of deep meaning. But if 
such be the case, then it seems to the writer that those who 
deal with this subject from these other than psychological 
standpoints should earnestly endeavor to gain a re-expression 
of their conception in a form which will not be self-contra- 
dictory, and which will differentiate it from the conception 
of the common man which we here consider. For it is clear 
that the doctrine of immortality as it is held by the average 
man, whether he be unlearned or of high intellectual training, 
is one which is bound up indissolubly with the psychological 
conceptions which we have been concerned to study; and 
 
-P-A-G-E-680
668 COROLLARIES 
equally clear that these psychological conceptions when criti- 
cally examined show us that the conception of the eternal 
existence of a human soul involves contradictions which lead 
us to the conclusion, as I have just said, that the problem it 
sets for us is from our standpoint meaningless, and without 
theoretical significance.

Sec. 7. The position we have thus reached cannot be 
accepted however without taking cognizance of certain im- 
portant considerations other than those thus far noted; for 
it is impossible to read with care the pages of religious and 
ethical history without being convinced that this doctrine of 
the immortality of the soul has had, as it still has, the most 
momentous practical significance in relation to the develop- 
ment of mankind. Not only has the conception a nobility 
which thrills many a man ; but beyond this it has served, and 
still serves, to ennoble the lives of many who otherwise might 
question whether in truth this life is worth living. 
In what follows I shall hope to show that although the 
studies we have made lead us to see that this conception is 
unsatisfactory ; yet that on the other hand they give us ground 
for holding all the more firmly to that in this conception that 
is noble and ennobling ; and that we may therefore hope that 
we have taken a step in the process of the re-expression of 
truth, as humanly conceived; and that we have gained a 
conception that may possibly be found to be a nearer approxi- 
mation, than that abandoned, to what we may describe as the 
Real Truth. 
Sec. 8. Those who see the value to man of this conception 
of immortality tell us that they cling to it in the main for 
four reasons. 
a, Because, without it the enforcement of moral responsi- 
bility would be difficult, or even impossible. 
8. Because, without it the maintenance of a belief in the
-P-A-G-E-681
  COROLLARIES 669 
prevalence of Justice in the universe would be impossible ; 
this belief being, from an ethical point of view, especially 
important to foster. 
ry. Because it leads us to look forward to a future life in 
which our ideals may be realized, in which the sinfulness and 
folly of this human existence may be replaced by righteousness 
and wisdom. 
5. Because it enables us to look forward to the influence 
upon us in the eternal future of the characters of those who 
have influenced us to our advantage and joy in this ephemeral 
life. 
Let us consider each of these points in their order. 
a 
Sec. 9. It is true that the enforcement of moral responsi- 
bility has been greatly aided in the past by the teaching that 
hidden sin will be punished, and that unrecognized holiness 
will be rewarded, in an eternally existing world tocome. But 
it is evident that in our day the terrors of hell, and the bliss 
of heaven, have lost their influence upon the more intelligent 
of mankind ; and that the pressure exerted in the past upon 
men by these conceptions in relation to the development of 
moral qualities is lacking today: so much so indeed that if 
we were convinced that man’s moral advance were really 
dependent upon the prevalence of the belief here studied we 
might well despair of the future. 
Such despair, however, is to my mind altogether unwar- 
ranted ; for I cannot but believe that the diverse conceptions 
developed in the course of our study of the real basis of 
individual responsibility in Part 1. of this chapter, or kindred 
conceptions, will take the place of that influence which has 
been lost through the weakening of the motives, so powerful 
in the past, which were determined by the somewhat ignoble 
fear of pain, and longing for pleasure, in a future life. 
That the insistence upon what we have called objective
-P-A-G-E-682
670 COROLLARIES 
responsibility as formulated in our legal systems is warranted, 
and that, if the views here maintained are valid, the law in- 
volving this insistence upon responsibility may be administered 
more consistently than is generally the case today, has I think 
been shown in the preceding pages just referred to. But 
here we are concerned mainly with the development of that 
inner sense of responsibility which is of such great importance 
to the ethical development of the’ individual: and it seems 
clear to me that the obligation to yield to the call of duty, 
to avoid sin and to search after righteousness, must necessarily, 
be strongly enforced by such a view as that already main- 
tained, viz. that the nature of each moment’s Self of an 
individual, new and unique though it be, is what it is because 
of the previous existence for the individual of all its past 
Selves ; and that the nature of all future Selves of the indi- 
vidual must necessarily be influenced by the act of the man’s 
Self in any moment under consideration. This means 
essentially what is meant by the usual conception of moral 
responsibility ; viz. that the present Self of any man in any 
given moment must bear the burden of guilt, or enjoy the 
credit of righteousness, due to the nature of the acts of the 
individual in the past ; and that the individual’s future Selves 
will bear the burden, or enjoy the credit, due to the nature of 
the present act of the Self. 
I cannot but believe that the influence of such a conception 
of subjective individual responsibility as that here suggested 
is likely to prove a stronger incentive to the development of 
a high moral standard among the thoughtful men of the 
future, than was found by their more ignorant forefathers in 
the fear of eternal damnation, and the longing for ever 
continuing bliss. | 
| B | Sec. to. Let us now turn to our second point made in 
Sec. 8. | 
The belief in immortality has without doubt, as we have 
 
-P-A-G-E-683
COROLLARIES 670 
just seen, strengthened the sense of moral responsibility by 
teaching the individual that punishment for his sin, and 
reward for his right living, are certain to be given in a future 
life. But it has had a value beyond this for those who take 
a broader view of life, and who see distress and injustice 
dealt out to men who have not sinned in manners which seem 
to us to call for retribution in the form of bodily pain, or loss 
and misfortune. As President Arthur T. Hadley * well says: 
“To a nation with a conscience the Gods of mythology give 
place to a God of righteousness. From this point it is but 
a short step to rationalism itself ; to a time when men begin 
to judge God by their own laws. A peoplé which had reached 
the stage of Jewish morals in the time of Nehemiah could 
not wait long before developing the Pharasaic rationalism of 
the centuries before the Christian era. The obvious in- 
equalities of justice that troubled them forced them to the 
doctrine of immortality as the only means by which the good- 
ness of God could be vindicated,—not the vague immortality 
of the tribal religions, but a system of immortal rewards 
and punishments whereby the glaring injustice of this world 
should be corrected in another.” 
That the doctrine of a readjustment of rewards and punish- 
ments in a future world has in the past had much to do with 
the persistence of the morally helpful belief in the prevalence 
of justice in the universe cannot be questioned. Without 
such a belief many a man of low intelligence would be led 
in his despair to throw off all restraint and live for the 
moment’s gratification. But when we consider this point 
with care it becomes apparent in the first place that this 
rationalistic conception of the working of God’s laws involves, 
as of essential moment ethically speaking, a comparison of 
the working of these laws with the individual’s ideals of 
justice and righteousness. And this may properly be inter- 
preted to mean that the fundamentally important moral 
1 Ethics as a Political Science, p. 116.
-P-A-G-E-684
  672 COROLLARIES 
element in connection with this belief lies in the fact that it 
involves the concentration of the individual’s thought upon 
his ideals of justice and righteousness, and in the fact that 
this leads to a strengthening of the hold upon him of these 
ideals, which in turn affect his actions in relation to his 
fellow men. 
But men of the type for whom I write will surely need no 
such pressure upon them as that given by the dread of 
punishment, or the hope of reward, in another world, to lead 
them to cling to their ideals of thought and practice. We 
know that these ideals are the individual’s mental constructs, 
conceptions which are formed in us by the nature of our 
characters as these are influenced by the powers within the 
universe : and we have a conviction that these ideals of ours, 
faulty though our descendants may think them to be, are 
based upon real situations and conditions in the universe, 
and are donc antl true expressions of these situations 
and conditions. We need no such pressure as that given in 
connection with a belief in a future hell or heaven to teach 
us, as all the higher religions have taught, a humble trust in 
the righteousness which governs the universe ; and we feel 
full warrant for our belief that the higher ideals which are 
given to us point the way to a fuller realization in our daily 
life of this universal righteousness. 
Beyond this, if we accept the view’ that a universal con- 
sciousness exists, in which our human consciousnesses are 
as it were elemental; we see that, as in our microcosmic 
bodies pain in, and curtailments of the normal functioning 
of, the parts is necessary at times if the health of the body 
as a whole is to be maintained; so we are ready to believe 
that the individual’s pains and misfortunes, which often seem 
so undeserved, may be equally necessary to the development 
of the fuller life to which corresponds the universal conscious- 
ness.

Sec. 11. We are carried thus naturally to the considera- 
tion of the third reason given by those who maintain the 
value of the commonly accepted conception of immortality. 
We long for an assurance that the movement of affairs in 
this world in which we think ourselves efficient is to lose 
none of our helpfulness when we die. We loath the 
thought that the influence we exert in this life is to cease 
at death. 
But it is apparent that the moral significance of this longing 
for a continuance of our efficiency lies in the fact that it is 
coordinate with the persistence and strengthening of our 
ideals; and, as we have seen in the preceding section, our 
enthusiastic and devoted effort towards the realization of our 
ideals is not dependent upon the influence upon us of any 
such pressure as is given by the doctrine of immortality here 
considered. 
And beyond this we recall that in connection with our view 
we must necessarily believe in the persistence of the influence 
of our acts through the eternal future, although in a sense 
somewhat different from that believed in by the common 
man. For as we view our Selves as parts of the universe it 
seems impossible to believe that the world, after the efficient 
activity of a human Self, can be the same that it was before 
this activity occurred ; or that the influence of such action of 
a Self can ever be lost while time itself exists. We are led 
thus to the conviction that such efficiency as we have exerted 
towards the realization of our ideals in this life will certainly 
persist to all eternity. 
é 
Sec. 12. We may now turn to the consideration of that 
enforcement of the common man’s belief in immortality which 
is due to his longing for the continued influence upon him 
of the lives of his loved companions who have slept the sleep 
2U
-P-A-G-E-686
674 COROLLARIES 
of death. No one can exaggerate the comfort that has been 
given to those in sorrow by the belief in the immortality of 
the soul; nor can one over estimate the value of this belief 
in the courage to live effective lives that it has given to those 
who mourn, notwithstanding the loss of those upon whom 
they have been accustomed to lean. 
It is difficult for one who has suffered thus deeply to treat 
the data in relation to the problem before us with logical 
fairness ; the ground upon which we tread is sacred for most 
of us, for none more so than for the writer of these lines. 
Nevertheless I think we are bound to agree that the desire 
for an immortal life for those of our loved ones who have 
left us is largely given in answer to demands of our emotional 
life, rather than to demands of the intellect : and we, from our 
present standpoint, must endeavor to deal with the subject 
before us, not as a matter of sentiment, but as a matter of 
reason. 
When we take such an attitude we at once see that what 
we long for is the continuing influence of an ideal life ; and 
that this ideal life is a conception of a life which was yesterday 
enforced by a bodily presence, with all its expressive activities, 
but which today is not thus enforced. And then it becomes 
apparent that this ideally conceived life is a special item 
within the thinker’s field of attention ; and that the persistence 
of the influence of this ideally conceived life is what we wish 
for; and that this persistence may be gained provided the 
nature of that ideal life is maintained in our thoughts, and 
is allowed to influence our active life, even though its physical 
embodiment no longer affects our daily experience. 
As with our own Selves, so with the Selves of our loved 
companions, no efficiency that was once theirs can ever be 
lost ; and if this remain to me in the guidance of my life I 
may truly say that it is here, and now, real for me; that I 
need not wait for a future life in which I may commune with 
my friend who has died ; that he, in all that was of his essence 
 
-P-A-G-E-687
COROLLARIES 675 
for me, is with me still, as a real influence, as part of the 
eternal that ever envelopes us. 
For me, as a conscious living being, what is the significance 
of this conception of the immortality of another soul except 
as it results in a satisfactory and effective experience for me? 
If my experience as such disappears at my death, then this 
recurrent concept of the immortal ego of the one I loved will 
truly dissolve away also. But surely that life which the world 
says is gone lives for me while I live, so long as its influence 
governs my thought and act; if this influence persists its 
gracious life is with me still. Upon my own Self depends 
its life for me. If with my death it, as it was for me, will 
disappear ; still while I live and answer to its influence, so 
much of it as was of the Eternal is mine. I do not have to 
wait for some future time for its realization ; it is mine now 
and here. And beyond this it does now, and will in the future 
belong to others while they live and answer to its influence : 
and when I die, so much of my Self as is of the Eternal will 
join with it in that future of efficient influence which we 
short-sighted creatures call the realm of Death. 
€ 
Sec. 13. We have thus considered the principal reasons 
why men of our type cling to the current conception of 
immortality. There is however a further reason of a more 
intricate nature which appeals with force to many men, and 
which we must briefly consider in closing this chapter.* 
Our close students of the philosophies of the East, in which 
the conception of the immortality of the soul is unrecognized, 
or unimportant, note that those who are bred under their 
influence come to look upon the life of the individual as of 
relatively small importance. To them therefore perhaps the 
most striking point in connection with the teaching of 
1T am indebted to Dr. Geo. W. Knox for having drawn my attention 
to this point.
-P-A-G-E-688
676 COROLLARIES 
Christianity is the stress it lays upon the conception of immor- 
tality ; and the significance it gives to the life of the individual, 
in the fact that the individual soul is looked upon as an entity 
destined to persist to all eternity in certain relations with an 
ever living God, the nature of these relations being largely, 
if not wholly, determined by the attitude of the individual 
soul towards God during the course of his earthly existence. 
Now evidently such a view as to. the importance of the 
individual soul carries with it certain moral values which are 
of the highest importance. 1st, It must lead to an emphasis 
of the individual’s sense of responsibility for his deed, and 
for the motive which inspires it. 2nd, It must lead to 
effort on the part of the serious believer to perfect his 
character. 3rd, It must lead him to take a fuller and more 
sympathetic interest in his fellowmen who are dignified, as 
he himself is dignified, by the assumed eternally existent 
relations with God. 
Clearly then the convert from the indifferentism and 
fatalism of the Eastern manner of thought must find in the 
Christian doctrine of immortality an incentive to earnestness 
in his life; and to thought concerning the propriety of his 
own conduct, in itself and especially as it is related to those 
with whom he comes in contact: and as clearly these same 
influences must have been felt by those of our own race to 
whom this belief has come as an heritage from their fore- 
fathers. 
And here again we are led to ask whether any or all of 
these valuable moral influences are to be lost if we find our- 
selves forced to hold that the doctrine of the immortality of 
the soul is self-contradictory. 
We have already shown in Sec. 9 above that our sense 
of responsibility is not dependent upon a conviction that the 
Self is to exist to all eternity ; and that the sense of responsi- 
bility is not weakened, but is rather strengthened, if we take 
the view of the nature of consciousness and of the Self which a 
 
-P-A-G-E-689
COROLLARIES 677 
we have maintained: we may therefore turn at once to the 
consideration of the second and third points made above. 
And then we are led to ask whether from our point of 
view we find ourselves without as great incentives to earnest- 
ness in the effort. to perfect our own characters, and to deal 
sympathetically with our fellowmen, if we are led to abandon 
the current doctrine of the immortality of the soul. I think 
not. Holding that the nature of each individual Self in 
each moment is certainly efficient in the determination of the 
nature of all other Selves which in future are to belong to 
the same individual, we have to my mind the very strongest 
of incentives to avoid error and sin, and to strive towards 
perfection of motive and act. 
And evidently again this striving on the part of the indi- 
vidual for perfection of motive and act must necessarily bring 
into prominence his relation with other Selves than his own ; 
which other Selves are recognized to be also efficient in the 
production of future Selves in connection with their individual 
bodies which are brought into such close social relations with 
his own. He who strives earnestly to perfect his moral life 
must necessarily have forced upon him the importance of his 
sympathetic impulses ; cannot but hold his fellowmen in high 
esteem ; cannot but find himself impelled to help them to 
gain such moral insight as has been granted to himself. 
Sec. 14. It would appear then that in no sense are the 
incentives to earnestness in effective living lost to those who 
find themselves failing to depend upon the doctrine of the 
immortality of the soul: that all the values for life that are 
commonly associated with the acceptance of that doctrine are 
fully maintained if we accept those views as to the nature of 
consciousness, and of the Self, which show us that this doctrine 
of immortality, as currently held, is self-contradictory and 
unsatisfactory.

Sec. 15. It must be evident to the reader that an adequate 
appreciation of the positions taken in the immediately 
preceding divisions of this chapter must necessitate a compre- 
hension of the conceptions upon which they are based, and 
which have been studied in the preceding chapters of this book ; 
and equally evident that the average man who is not instructed 
in the technical subjects upon which these conceptions rest 
must fail to grasp their meaning. It follows then that the 
re-expression of the truth which I hope I may here have made 
must almost certainly be misunderstood and misinterpreted 
if it is brought to the notice of the common man, and even 
of the man of average broad education. 
Moreover, I think I have shown that, from our standpoint, 
what is of the essence of the doctrine of immortality, as it 
is commonly held, is true ; even though we are compelled to 
hold that the doctrine itself is but a very crude and inadequate 
expression of the full truth. It thus appears that the doctrine 
as commonly held, with all its value, may properly be allowed 
to stand without opposition, and without effort to replace it 
in the thought of men as a whole, who as they gain a deeper 
‘insight into the nature of what they call soul life will them- 
selves naturally attempt some such re-expression of the truth 
involved in the doctrine as I have aimed here to give. The 
belief in the immortality of the soul has given countless men 
courage to do right ; has assuaged the grief of unnumbered 
millions ; and may still bestow these same benefits upon vast 
numbers of our descendants before they are capable of gain- 
ing new conceptions which, while bringing equal benefits, 
are more clearly true. 
Moreover, as I have said in the opening sections of this 
chapter, one cannot but face the fact that his own attempted 
re-expression of a truth is all too likely to prove inadequate. 
We cannot forget that we are here looking at the subject
-P-A-G-E-691
COROLLARIES 679 
before us from a very special point of view, and that the 
doctrine of the immortality of the soul may have significance 
beyond the realms of realness with which our thought has 
been concerned ; may have values which are not touched by 
the considerations we may properly present. 
For these reasons I feel that we may well allow the average 
man to cling to the doctrine of immortality as he commonly 
holds it,—may well avoid all efforts to reduce his confidence 
in this belief,—-without feeling that we lack courage to face 
the danger of misapprehension and distrust which must come 
to those who attack conceptions which are cherished by the 
majority of the noblest men who live ; and which in the very 
fact that they have persisted long, and have yielded much of 
value to men, must be held in some measure to express the 
truth.

  PAIN, PLEASURE, AND ASTHETICS 
An Essay concerning the Psychology of Pain and Pleasure, with 
special reference to Aisthetics. 8vo. 8s. 6d. net. 
When Mr, Marshall first undertook the study of the theory of art, many 
years ago, he was impressed by ‘‘the emphasis of pleasure attainment in all 
descriptions of art works,” and by the emphatic pleasureableness of his own 
mental state during the contemplation of artistic productions. His thought 
being thus turned to the consideration of the relation of esthetics to hedonics, 
he was led to make a careful study of the psychology of pleasure, and of its 
correlate pain. The results of this study are given in the present volume. 
NATURE.—“ There is Boge stuff in the work, and the author is evidently well up in 
the literature of his subject. . . . The book is written in the right spirit and on right lines.” 
Mr. BERNARD BOSANQUET in the PALL MALL GAZETTE.—‘‘I have found the 
book extremely interesting. . . . In all respects Mr. Marshall’s book will be found stimu- 
lating, and in many it corrects popular misapprehensions.” 
Pror, WILLIAM James, in THE NATION (U.S.A.).—‘‘It may well be said that 
Mr. Marshall’s essay is the most successful of all yet published attempts to conceive our 
pleasures and displeasures under something like a single point of view. . . . No previous writer has given a general formula which covers anything like the same amount of ground. 
Acquaintance with Mr. Marshall’s work will be indispensable to every future student of 
the subject. His own learning is admirably complete; we cannot name any modern 
author of consequence of whose writings he has not taken account. The modesty of his 
tone is also remarkable, considering that his mental temperament is ‘radical,’ and that he 
is fighting for a creation of his own. Apart from its special topic, too, the book is full of 
shrewd and original psychology, All these qualities render it almost ‘epoch-making’ the present situation of science. 
ZESTHETIC PRINCIPLES 
CROWN 8vo. 5s. net. 
Mr. Marsuatt does not, in this volume, attempt to cover the 
whole subject discussed in his former work “ Pain, Pleasure, and 
sthetics,” but sketches out the results which are of the greatest 
interest and most practical value in reference to the study of 
Zésthetics from the varying points of view of the observer, the 
artist, and the critic. The book is intended not so much for the 
scientific psychologist as for less critical readers. 
MIND.—<‘‘ Mr. Marshall has done well to follow up his larger work, ‘Pain, Pleasure, 
and Aésthetics,’ by this interesting little volume. We are much in need of a good intro- 
duction to Zisthetics, and Mr. Marshall’s conception of the subject lends itself on the 
whole to a popular treatment. . . . The work is clearly and pleasantly written and should aid artists as well as amateurs and. critics in getting clearer ideas of the aims of art and of 
the limitations under which it works.” 
ACADEMY.—" A work which is full of sound and stimulating thought.” 
NATION (U.S.A.).—'‘ The text is briefly and clearly written, and gives the results, 
and something more, of the investigations which the author has already published in more technical form, and which we reviewed a year ago. It has, therefore, every claim on the attention of those interested in the science of beauty, if we can speak Of the science of so 
elusive a thing. . .. The principles of art criticism that follow from Mr. Marshall's 
zsthetic theory seem to us admirably wise and liberal, They are, moreover, very modestly stated by the author, whose book, we ee, has an importance much greater 
than its bulk.”

INSTINCT AND REASON 
An Essay concerning the relation of Instinct to Reason, 
with some special study of the Nature of Religion. 
8vo. 12s. 6d. net. 
EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE 
THE writing of this book was first undertaken because I wished to 
present the conception of Religion which will be found below. In 
attempting to make my argument convincing I have found it necessary 
to deal with questions which did not at first appear to relate to the 
subject I wished to discuss, and the study of Religion thus appears as 
a subsidiary part of the broader treatment of Instinct and Reason; the 
reader will readily perceive, however, that it still remains the most 
important and most interesting matter considered, 
It has long seemed to me evident that activities which are so 
universal in man as are those which express our religious life, cannot 
fail to be of significance in relation to our biological development, 
especially as these activities have persisted for so many a,.3 in the 
human race. I have, therefore, attempted to outline a theory which 
will account for the existence of religious activities, and which will 
explain their biological import. 
ATHEN 4 UM.—‘ This is a noteworthy and in some respects an important contri- bution to the sempiternal question of the relation between the rational and instinctive sides 
of man’s nature. Mr. Marshall has given it a more special interest by concentrating his 
line of argument upon the question of the nature and validity of the religious instinct. 
His contribution, therefore, appeals not alone to the psychologist, but to the student of 
natural theology, and still more to the general student of thought, if any such remain in 
these days of specialization. . . . This abstract of a very complex line of argument will perhaps be sufficient to indicate the novelty and some of the force of Mr. Marshall's 
contribution to the higher thought. In detail he may have been anticipated by many 
thinkers and psychologists of recent days; but taken altogether, his line of argument is 
original, and cannot fail to have an influence on contemporary speculation. It will not be altogether satisfactory to the theologian to find even the higher impulses based to a certain 
extent on illusion. The philosopher, on the other hand, will scarcely remain satisfied 
with the position that religion is a higher development than reason, but both must 
recognise the force with which Mr. Marshall puts his new contentions, and the skill with 
which he connects them with some of the most puzzling phenomena in the mental 
development of the race. Altogether this is a notable book, which cannot but have an. 
effect on contemporary speculation.” 
WESTMINSTER REVIEW.—‘ The work contains much that is informing and 
deserving of careful consideration.” 
SCOTSMAN.—‘‘An extremely interesting and suggestive essay on some of the deepest problems of modern thought.” 
GLASGOW HERALD,—“ The book is a wide and sreliiaforties discussion of an 
important subject.”

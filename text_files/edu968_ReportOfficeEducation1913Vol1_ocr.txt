  XEPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epvucation, 
Washington, April 29, 1914. 
Sm: An examination of the two volumes of the Report of 
the Commissioner of Education fer the year ended June 30, 1913, 
shows that they constitute a fairly complete yearbook of the progress 
of education for that year in the United States and a record of the 
most important events connected with the progress of education in 
other culture countries. None of the statistics in the second volume 
of the report are as complete or accurate as they should be, and the 
statistics for State school systems are still one year late. JI fear both 
defects must continue to mar these reports till more adequate funds 
for collecting statistics are available. I do not know of any other 
agency that attempts with so little money to collect, compile, digest, 
and interpret so large and varied a mass of statistics from so wide a 
territory. For the year 1913 these statistics cover 57 States, Terri- 
tories, and possessions of the United States, approximately 1,200 
cities, 14,000 high schools, 900 kindergarten systems, and 1,000 private 
kindergartens, 1,150 colleges, universities, and professional schools, 
800 normal schools, 675 industrial schools, 350 schools for negroes 
(mostly secondary schools), 600 commercial schools, 270 schools for 
abnormal children—deaf, dumb, blind, feeble-minded, criminal, 
etc.—675 summer schools, 1,000 museums, 15,000 libraries, and 
several thousand educational associations and societies. The.report 
covers the facts of school attendance for more than 25 millions of 
children and the expenditure of approximately three-quarters of a 
billion dollars. Because of the importance of the information con- 
tained in these statistics, for which there is no other source, it is very 
desirable that the bureau should be enabled to make its statistical 
reports complete, accurate, and up to date. 
tn no previous report, I believe, has so wide a range of topics been 
discussed as in the 43 chapters of the first volume of this report. 
The list includes many phases of elementary, secondary, and higher 
education, the educational work of the Army and the Navy in the 
Military Academy at West Point and the Naval Academy at Annap- 
olis and elsewhere, vocational and professional education, the kinder- 
garten, schools for defective children, the educational activities of

the Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran, and Mormon churches, the Young 
Men’s Christian Association, the educational work of libraries and 
museums, and a summary of educational activities in Canada, the 
Latin-American States, Great Britain and Ireland, Sweden, Norway, 
Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Germany, 
Austria-Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Russia, Japan, 
Siam, China, India, Australia and New Zealand; in the French colo- 
nies and the Italian and German possessions in Africa; also in Li- 
beria, Egypt, and South Africa. The commissioner is under obli- 
gation, not only to members of the bureau staff, but also to many 
men. not connected with the bureau, for their generous assistance in 
preparing these chapters. In many instances the work has been 
done for only nominal remuneration. Some important chapters that 
should appear in the report have been omitted because there has 
been no one in the bureau with sufficient knowledge of the subjects 
to prepare them, and there has been no fund with which to employ 
others to do it. 
When the defects here mentioned can be remedied, the Annual 
Report of the Commissioner of Education will deserve the reputation 
which it already has, that of being the world’s best yearbook in 
education. 
INTERPRETATION OF SOME STATISTICS. 
For the year ended June 30, 1912, the estimated number of children 
- of school age (5 to 18) was 25,167,445, an increase of 421,883, or 1.7 
per cent over the previous year. The number of pupils of all ages 
enrolled in the public schools was 18,182,937, which was 72 per cent 
of the total estimated number of children of school age, and eighty-two 
one-hundredths of 1 per cent more than were enrolled the year before. 
The average daily attendance in the public schools was 13,302,303, 
an increase of 430,323, or 3.34 per cent over the year ended June 30, 
1911. The average daily attendance was only 52.7 per cent of the 
total number of children of school age in the country, and 73.2 per 
cent of the total enrollment in the public schools. The total enroll- 
ment in the public, private, and parochial schools was approximately 
78 per cent of the school population, and the total average daily 
attendance in schools of all kinds was only 57 per cent of the total 
school population. This shows that the average number of days of 
schooling for the children of school age for that year was only 90. 
An average of 90 days in school and 275 days out of school for the 
entire school population gives a dangerously small amount of school- 
ing for the future citizens of our democratic Republic and the demo- 
cratic States and smaller communities of which it is composed. At 
this rate the total average schooling for each child, to prepare it for 
life and for making a living, for society and the duties of citizenship,
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XVII 
is only 1,170 days, a number still far short of the minimum average 
of 1,620 days with which we should be content, as set forth in the 
commissioner’s report for last year. ; 
The number of teachers in the public schools within the year in- 
creased from 533,606 to 547,289, a gain of 2.56 per cent. For each 
teacher employed in the public schools, 33 children were enrolled 
and 24 were in average daily attendance. The proportion of chil- 
dren to teachers is not now too large. Except as the school popula- 
tion may increase, we do not need to add to the number of teachers 
in the schools so much as we need to increase their efficiency and, 
by the consolidation of small schools and the division of the over- 
crowded rooms and classes in large schools, to bring about a better 
distribution of teachers and pupils. The proportion of male to female 
teachers was slightly larger than for the year before. It is to be 
hoped that this marks the beginning of a new tendency. Many of 
the most valuable features of our American public schools are due 
to the fact that they have been able to obtain the services of women 
of good native ability and fine culture. For most of the work re- 
quired in the elementary schools and a large part of that of the high 
schools women are better fitted than men, and a large per cent of the 
teachers in these schools should be women. But there is good reason 
for the feeling which has been growing for some years that the propor- 
tion of men in the schools has become too small. 
The increase of 6,358 buildings used as schoolhouses does not indi- 
cate much progress in school consolidation, either in country or city. 
The per cent of increase in schoolhouses is nearly twice as large as the 
per cent of increase in enrollment. That the new schoolhouses are 
better than the old, and that the people are willing to pay for better 
school equipment, is shown by the increase of more than $44,500,000 
in the value of public school property. The percentage of increase 
in the value of public school property was 3.66. Although the year 
for which this report is made was marked by much unfriendly criti- 
cism of the public schools, the people showed the permanence of their 
faith in these schools by contributing to their support more liberally 
than in any previous year. The expenditure for the public schools 
within the year reached the grand total of $482,886,793, which was 
8 per cent more than for the year before. The per capita expenditure 
for the total population was $5.07; for the total school population, 
$9.19; for the total enrollment, $26.56; and for the total average 
attendance for the average school year of 158 days, $36.30. The 
average school term of 158 days is the highest yet reported. 
The statistics for high schools, colleges, and professional and technical 
schools are for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1913. Within this year 
the number of public and private high schools increased 2.9 per cent, 
and the number of high-school students increased 4.45 per cent. The  
-P-A-G-E-18
XVIII EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
total number of high schools reported to the bureau-was 13,445, the 
number of high-school teachers reported was 27,092, and the number 
of high-school students was 1,283,009. Itis to be regretted that there 
is no separate report of the expenditures for high-school purposes. 
Expenditures for public high schools for the year 1911-12 are included 
in the total expenditures for public schools for that year. The larger 
increase in high-school teachers as compared with the increase of 
schools and students shows a commendable effort to supply teachers 
qualified to teach the different subjects of the high-school curriculum 
and to reduce the size of high-school classes. The average number 
of students for each high-school teacher was only a small fraction more 
than 19. 
The 596 colleges and universities reporting in 1912 and again in 
1913 show an increased attendance of 2.35 per cent of college students 
in graduate and undergraduate courses, and a decrease of 11 per cent 
in the number of preparatory students. The fact that the per cent 
of increase in the number of high-school students was two and six- 
tenths times as large as the per cent of increase in the school popu- 
lation, and the per cent of increase in the number of college students 
40 per cent larger than the increase in the school population, shows a 
satisfactory response to the ever-increasing need for a larger number 
of men and women with better preparation for the duties of society 
and State than can be had in the elementary schools. The large 
decrease in the number of students in the preparatory schools and 
classes of colleges indicates a rapid increase in the efficiency of the 
high schools. ‘The time should soon come when it will be no longer 
necessary for any college to maintain preparatory classes. Not only 
is it much better for the colleges that they use all their means for 
legitimate college work, it is also better for the high schools and the 
communities which they serve that they be not weakened by having 
their students withdrawn before they have finished their high-school 
work. It is also true in most instances that the high-school work 
can be done better and at less cost in the regular high schools than 
in the preparatory classes of colleges. Probably the large decrease 
in the number of students in the preparatory classes of colleges is due 
to some extent also to the more liberal practice of the colleges in 
accepting for admission work in subjects other than those heretofore 
required. 
The continued decrease in the number of professional schools— 
theology, law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and veterinary medi- 
cine—and in the number of students in these schools is evidence of 
the continuation of the efforts to raise the standards of the schools 
and of their requirements for admission. The decrease was greatest 
in schools of medicine, in which the year shows a net loss of 7 schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. xIxX 
and of 1,214 students, 6 per cent of the total number of schools and 
7.6 per cent of the total number of students. 
The large increase of 18 per cent in the number of summer schools, 
26 per cent in-the number of summer-school teachers, and 27.5 per 
cent in the number of summer-school students, may be due in part 
to more complete returns. It is, however, due still more to the 
growing popularity of these schools, which afford teachers, college 
students, and others opportunity to devote to study time which would 
otherwise be lost. Not all summer-school work is of college grade, 
but much of it is, and most of it is done with an eagerness and earnest- 
‘ness of purpose and a maturity of mind which much of the college 
work of the regular sessions does not show. The total number of 
summer-school students reported was 181,288, only 11 per cent less 
than the total number of college students reported. A large pro- 
portion of these summer-school students, probably three-fourths 
of them, are teachers in elementary and secondary schools. The 
fact that more than one-fourth of all the teachers in these schools 
attend the summer schools reporting to this bureau as such, while 
a much larger number attend the county and city institutes for one 
or more weeks each summer, is evidence both of their desire to 
prepare themselves to do better work and of the popular demand for 
greater efficiency in teaching. 
The reports show an increase of 8 in the number of public normal 
schools, a decrease of 1 in the private normal schools, and an increase 
of 4,471 in the total number of students enrolled in normal schools of 
both classes. The fact that the increase in the number of normal- 
school students is less than one-third of the increase in the number 
of public-school teachers shows how little progress we are making 
toward the ideal of a teacher with professional preparation for every 
schoolroom. The intensity of the feeling of the need for teachers 
with some professional preparation is shown by the fact that 931 
public high schools and 265 private high schools report training 
courses for teachers, with a total of 27,050 students enrolled in these 
courses. This is an increase of 93 public high schools and a decrease 
of 2 private high schools, as compared with the year before, and a 
total increase of 3,920 students enrolled for this work. These high- 
school teacher-training courses are intended almost wholly to prepare 
teachers for the rural schools. Most of the graduates of the normal ~ 
schools still go to the city and town schools. The fact that country- 
school teachers are given less preparation (many of them have none 
except the education of the elementary schools) would seem to indi- 
cate that teachers in rural schools need less maturity, knowledge, 
and professional training than teachers in city schools. Just the 
reverse is true, however, and it is to be hoped this may soon be gen- 
erally understood. When it is understood, schools of the very best  
-P-A-G-E-20
  XX EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
type and in sufficient quantity will be established and maintained 
for the purpose of preparing teachers for all country schools. 
THE WORK OF THE BUREAU. 
The annual statement of the commissioner to the Secretary of the 
Interior for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1913, shows a large increase 
in the work of the bureau. The number of publications issued was 
larger than for any other year since the bureau was established. 
Besides the two volumes of the commissioner’s report and the annual 
statement to the Secretary, these publications included 44 bulletins, 
3 circulars, and a medical handbook for the Alaska school service. 
Many of these bulletins were published in the full number permitted 
by law, and for most of them the immediate demand was greater than 
the supply. Besides the printed bulletins the bureau issued 200 or 
more multigraph circular letters of from one to six pages in length. 
These are sent to school officers and teachers and to the press. The 
average number of copies of these letters was about 5,000. The 
bulletins and letters covered a wide range of subjects. Letters re- 
ceived from school officers and from teachers of all grades and kinds 
in all parts of the country indicate that both bulletins and letters 
were well received and have accomplished much good. The number 
of copies of the publications of the bureau distributed was nearly 
double the number distributed the year before, and more than three 
and one-half times the number for 1910. Nearly four times as many 
letters were received at the bureau and answered in this year as in 
the year 1910. ‘The commissioner and the specialists in higher edu- 
cation, school administration, rural schools, school sanitation and 
hygiene, and negro education visited many more schools and attended 
many more meetings of teachers and school officers than had ever 
been possible before. This opportunity of personal contact with 
schools, teachers, officers, and citizens has enabled the bureau to 
acquire a large amount of accurate first-hand knowledge of educa- 
tional conditions and needs and to give the kind of help that can 
not be given in any other way. 
The specialist in school hygiene and sanitation and his assistants 
gave direct help in regard to the construction of schoolhouses to 
school officers in 19 States, from New York to California and from 
~ Michigan to Florida and Texas, saving to the communities repre- 
sented by these officials hundreds of thousands of dollars and giving 
to the communities better school buildings than they would have 
had without this help. The demand for the loan of six collapsible 
cardboard models of three different types of rural schoolhouses has 
been far greater than could be supplied. This demand comes from 
school officers, boards of health, lumbermen, builders, normal schools, 
departments of education in colleges and universities, and conventions
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXI. 
of teachers and school officers. There is great need for an extension 
of this service. 
In addition to the studies which the bureau made of schools and 
colleges in the United States and its possessions, a member of the 
Division of School Administration made a careful first-hand study 
of the schools of certain Cantons and cities of Switzerland, the chief 
purpose of the study being to discover the means by which the schools 
adapt their organization and work to the local conditions and needs 
of the communities which they serve. Three members of the Rural 
School Division have spent some time in Denmark studying the 
rural schools of that country and making a special investigation into 
the so-called folk high schools. A temporary appointee to the 
position of specialist in higher education went to the British Isles to 
undertake a careful study of the newer tendencies in the universities 
of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The results of these studies 
have been, or will be, published as bulletins of the bureau and will, 
I believe, prove to be very valuable to those who are working to 
improve our schools and to all students of education. 
Within the year three new divisions were established in the bureau, 
the Divisions of Negro Education, Kindergarten Education, and 
Home Education. 
Besides a general preliminary survey of schools for negroes in the 
Southern States, the Division of Negro Education made a careful 
study of high schools, private and industrial schools for negroes in 
Alabama, and is extending this study to all the States of this section. 
The Division of Kindergarten Education, with the help of the 
National Kindergarten Association and the International Kinder- 
garten Union, made an inquiry into the status of kindergartens and 
kindergarten work in the United States, the results of which have been 
published in a bulletin of the bureau, and began a careful study in 
detail of many special phases of kindergarten work. Through this 
division an exhaustive study will be made of the whole problem of 
the education of very young children in schools and institutions of 
different kinds. 
The Division of Home Education was established near the end of 
the year. Through this division the bureau is undertaking to assist 
parents in the education of their children in the home before they 
enter school and after they quit school, and to bring about a closer 
and more intelligent cooperation between home and school. 
Within the year the Division of Rural Education was enlarged by 
the addition of two specialists and a chief of field service, and by the 
promotion of an assistant in the division to the position of specialist 
in rural education. For the first time in its history the bureau has 
been able to begin a general investigation into the condition and needs
-P-A-G-E-22
XXII "EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of the rural and village schools of the country and to make suggestions 
and offer assistance toward their improvement. 
The specialist in the Division of School Administration has made a 
study of the schools of towns and cities of not more than 25,000 popu- 
lation. The conditions under which the schools of towns and cities 
of this class are conducted make it possible to adopt improvements 
more readily than can be done in larger cities. 
The list of special collaborators serving the bureau at a nominal 
salary was increased during the year from 42 to 65. These collabo- 
rators are men and women of special ability and interest, working 
under such conditions as enable them to give valuable service to the 
bureau without interfering with their duties. Some of them bring 
to the bureau the helpful cooperation of important committees and 
commissions, thus enabling it to extend its work in a way otherwise 
impossible except at the cost of large expenditures for specialists. 
Some of these special collaborators have desks in the bureau and give 
valuable assistance in carrying on its correspondence, making inves-. 
tigations, preparing reports, and otherwise. Many other men and 
women, not officially connected with the bureau, have cooperated 
generously and ably with the commissioner and specialists in the 
bureau. It is evident that when the bureau can have a sufficient 
force of able specialists in its employ it can have the hearty assist- 
ance of large numbers of the ablest men and women in various 
departments of education throughout the country, thus enabling it 
to increase largely the volume and value of its work. 
For the purpose of extending information in regard to the best 
which has been done in drawing in the public elementary and second- 
ary schools of the country, Dr. Henry Turner Bailey and Mr. Royal 
Bailey Farnum, at my request, prepared for the bureau a select exhibit 
of drawings done in elementary and secondary schools of the United 
States. This exhibit, consisting of 96 large mounts, showing draw- 
ings of all kinds in various grades up to the last grade of the high 
school and so arranged as to show progress from grade to grade, is 
sent by the bureau to cities and meetings of educational associations 
upon request and the payment of transportation. The bureau has 
prepared several sets of lantern slides, with accompanying materials 
for lectures, on rural schools of this country and the schools of Den- 
mark and Switzerland. These slides with their lecture texts are sent 
on request for use in teachers’ meetings, meetings of citizens, and 
elsewhere. 
A very large part of the work which it should do, and for which it was 
created, the bureau has not been able to undertake for lack of funds. 
The need for some of this work is very great, and it is hoped that it 
may soon be possible to begin it. 
   
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXIII 
SOME TENDENCIES. 
In my report for the fiscal year 1912 I spoke of the current criticism 
of the public schools, much of which was constructive and helpful, 
but some of which was neither intelligent nor sympathetic. Most 
of this criticism has given way to careful studies made to see just 
what the schools are doing and what changes are needed to enable 
them to do their work better and adapt themselves to the needs of the 
people and the times they serve. Detailed surveys have been made 
of several cities and States and of counties in other States. The 
reports of some of these surveys are illuminating and helpful. In 
some instances, notably in the State of Ohio, the surveys have led 
to wise and helpful legislation. The practice of having such surveys 
made is likely to increase. Any community may well want to know 
just what it is getting for its expenditures for schools, whether the 
time of its children in school is used to the best advantage, and what 
changes in organization and conduct of the schools are necessary 
tosecure the best results. Asurvey made by intelligent educators and 
business men offers the best means of obtaining this information. 
Possibly a word of caution against the professional surveyor will not 
be out of place. It is easy to cause adverse criticisms to be made 
against the schools of a city or State, arouse discontent and suspicion 
among patrons and taxpayers, suggest the need of a survey and the 
advantages to be derived from it, and then offer, for a consideration, 
the services of an individual or group of individuals to make the 
survey. Probably there is no more difficult task in all the field of 
educational effort than that of making an intelligent and constructive 
educational survey of a city, county, or State. Officials wanting 
such surveys made should use all diligence and care in obtaining the 
help of disinterested men and women. Like most other things in 
the field of education, this work had better not be done at all than not 
done well. 
Itis pleasing to note the increased interest shown by individuals 
and communities in several parts of the country in the teaching of 
adult illiterates to read and write, and to enable those of meager 
education to extend their knowledge of things pertaining to their 
duties as citizens, as members of society, and as participants in the 
industrial and economic life of the country. The success of the 
effort to eliminate illiteracy in Rowan County, Ky., has given other 
communities courage, as has also the success of experiments in teach- 
ing illiterate immigrants in the factory schools in New York City and 
elsewhere, and of experiments made by the employees of the Young 
Men’s Christian Association. If there were some central agency 
through which this movement could be encouraged and directed, it 
would, I believe, soon extend to all cities and States in which there is  
-P-A-G-E-24
    XXIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1918. 
any large number of adult illiterates, and within a few years most of 
the five and a half million adult illiterates would have learned at 
least to read and write, and millions of men and women of meager 
education would have extended their knowledge. This bureau is the 
proper agency for the promotion of this work, if funds can be had for it. 
In my report for 1912 I called attention to the excessively short 
terms of the rural schools in several States. It is gratifying to be 
able to state that some of the States having the shortest school term 
have taken steps to increase their length. The suggestion for a 
school term of not less than 180 days has met with general approval 
and the campaign for the attainment of this ideal has begun. 
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL 
SYSTEMS. 
Investigations made by this bureau indicate quite cleaily several 
additions and changes needed for the improvement of our schools 
and school systems. Among these are the following: 
I. More kindergartens.—In all cities, towns, and villages, and 
especially in all manufacturing communities, kindergartens and other 
schools for the right education of children under the ordinary school 
age should be established and maintained. In the country where 
children come in close contact with nature and take part in the simple 
industrial and social activities of the home, as also in the homes of 
intelligent, thoughtful, and well-to-do people who provide suitable 
occupations for their children, there may be less need of the kinder- 
garten and infant schools of other kinds; but for the children of the 
poor in the cities where the home environment is bad; for the chil- 
dren of laborers who are left all day alone, fathers, mothers, and older 
brothers and sisters being away in the mills and shops and mines; 
for the children of the indulgent rich, overdressed, supplied with an 
overabundance of toys, and left to the unintelligent care of servants; 
and for the children of the overcareful, whose parents would shield 
them from contact with nature and the possibility of contamination 
from association with other children, and rear them in jealously 
guarded exclusion, there is great need for the sane, normal exercises 
and lessons of the kindergarten or Montessori school. In reply to a 
recent inquiry this bureau obtained information from 6,371 public and 
994 private kindergartens, in which 364,189 children were enrolled. In 
the cities, towns, and manufacturing villages of the country there 
are no less than 2,000,000 children between the ages of 4 and 6 who 
should have the care and teaching of the kindergarten. Within the 
last two years several States have enacted laws permitting the use 
of public-school funds for the support of kindergartens. 
IL. Rearrangement of elementary and high school.—The 12 years of 
elementary and high school, now grouped into 8 years of primary and
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXV 
grammar school and 4 years of high school, should be rearranged into 
6 years of elementary school and 6 years of high school. The 6 high- 
school years should be subdivided into 3 years of junior high school 
and 3 years of senior high school. I know no valid reason for the 
present division except the historical one, that the primary school of 3 
or 4 years was gradually extended a year at a time to 7, 8, or 9 years 
before the high school was gencrally adopted as a part of the public- 
school system. The following are some of the generally accepted 
reasons for the suggested change: 
1. For most children the beginning of adolescence, marking the 
transition from childhood to youth, comes at 12 or 13. Most writers 
on education havo recognized this and accepted it in making their 
plans for a school system. Bishop Comenius suggested 6 years for 
the school of infancy or the school of the mother’s kneo, 6 years for the 
vernacular school, 6 years for the school of languages or the high 
school, and 6 years for the college, university, and professional 
schools. Children entering school at 6 and attending regularly com- 
plete the work of the first 6 grades at 12 or 13 years of age. 
2. In most of our schools children make little real progress in the 
seventh and eighth grades. There has been much complaint that 
this is a period of marking time. This is especially truc when the 
subject matter and the methods of the elementary school are carried 
through these grades, and when all the teachers are women. 
3. Taking up the seventh and eighth years as a part of the high 
school makes it easy to begin departmental teaching in these grades 
and to adapt the methods of teaching and discipline to the changing 
demands of the children. It also makes it much easier to begin work 
in foreign languages, constructive geometry, history, literature, and 
elementary science where they should begin. We lose much by post- 
poning the study of languages to the later years, when children have 
grown out of the imitative period of life, in which they can most easily 
learn to understand, speak, read, and write a new language. This 
division also makes it possible to introduce vocationa! education two 
years earlier than is now the practice, and for many reasons it is 
very desirable that this should be done. 
4. Our high-school work now suffers in comparison with that of the 
Gymnasium and Realschule of Germany, the lycée of France, and the 
public school of England, and much of the work of our colleges must 
therefore be of a very elementary kind. With the rearrangement 
proposed here, boys and girls at the end of the 12 years of elementary 
and secondary school might have to their credit a much larger amount 
of effective work in languages, mathematics, science, and other sub- 
fects than they now have. With a little more care in the selection 
of high-school teachers and the adoption of the plan of promoting 
the teachers with the children through the elementary grades, as
-P-A-G-E-26
  XXVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
explained later in this Introduction, one or two full years might 
be gained. 
5. Only about one-fourth of the children now enter the high 
schools. In most States the compulsory-attendance period corre- 
sponds closely to that of the elementary school. Parents and chil- 
dren are thereby confirmed in the belief that the education of the 
elementary school is all that is needed. The break between the 
elementary school and the high school, coming at the end of the 
compulsory-attendance period, suggests quitting school and makes 
it easy. If the break came at the end of six years of elementary 
school work, most of the children would at the end of the compulsory- 
attendance period already have been in high school two years, 
doing high-school work in the high-school way, under high-school 
conditions, with high-school teachers, in company with those chil- 
dren who would under present conditions enter and ge through the 
high school, and many more children than now enter the high school 
at all would remain through the entire high-school period. 
6. In the larger cities the adoption of this plan would require more 
high-school buildings and fewer elementary-school buildings than 
the present plan. The larger number of high-school buildings 
would bring the high school closer to a large part of the school popu- 
lation. 
7. The division of the six years of high school into two sections 
of three years each would make a second differentiation and read- 
justment of work possible and easy. 
IIL. Advancement of teacher with the class——Teachers and pupils 
should remain together longer, especially in the first years of school 
life. At present teachers of rural schools come and go, only a small 
per cent remaining at one place more than one school year, and a much 
smaller per cent more than two years. They do not remain long 
enough to learn the ideals, conditions, and needs of the community 
or to acquire that intimate knowledge of the children which every 
teacher should have. In most city schools a teacher in any of the 
first six or eight grades remains in the same grade from year to year 
while the stream of children flows by her. Under these conditions the 
teacher may become painfully familiar with the minute details of the , 
course of study as made out for the particular grade, but she never 
becomes acquainted with the individual children of any group she 
teaches. At the beginning of the school year in the fall, or at the 
beginning of the second half year in midwinter, from 40 to 50 children 
promoted from the next lower grade come into the teacher’s room to 
take the place of a like number who have been sent on to another 
teacher in the next higher grade. The teacher knows nothing 
of the children, not even their names. Probably she has never 
seen any of them before: She knows nothing of their character,
-P-A-G-E-27
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXVIL 
nor of their varying abilities in the different subjects of the 
course, and has only vague ideas of what they have been taught in 
the grades below and of what they are expected to learn in the grades 
above, for which her work is supposed to prepare them. Knowing 
nothing of the parentage of the children, she can not know what 
powers, capacities, tendencies, heredities, are to be expected and to 
be developed or restrained in any individual child. Knowing nothing 
of their past experiences in the home, in the field, in the shop, on the 
playground, and in association with kindred and friends, she does not 
know how to use the results of these vital experiences as the raw ma- 
terial of the lessons to be learned inschool. Knowing nothing of their 
present home life, their occupations and interests, and their relations 
to their parents, she is unable to bring about that close cooperation 
between school and home and the unity of school and home interests 
without which the work of the school can not be made to take hold 
as it should on the lives of the children. Having very little definite 
knowledge of the details of the work which the children have done 
in the lower grades, she is unable to use the knowledge gained in 
these grades as the basis of the new lessons, to interpret the new in 
terms of the old, and to dovetail the one into the other in such a way 
as to make the work of the year an intelligent development and con- 
tinuation of that of previous years. Having never conducted a class 
through any of the grades higher than the one in which she teaches, 
she has little conception of the relation of the work of this grade to 
the higher grades, and is therefore unable to select out of the mass 
of facts and principles with which she deals those on which emphasis 
should be placed as a preparation for future work. With no knowl- 
edge of the inner life of the children, of their ideals, hopes, purposes, 
and dreams of the future, she is unable to make the lessons of the 
school take hold on these, modifying them and being enriched by 
them, as must be the case before the school, its lessons, and its disci- 
plines can be made to project themselves into the future and take 
hold on life as they should, and as they must, before they can 
become fruitful in life and character and deeds. In all city schools, 
teachers of the first four or five grades should be promoted from year 
to year with their classes. 
To this plan two objections are frequently raised: (1) That the 
teacher may be inefficient, and that no group of children should be 
condemned to the care and instruction of an inefficient teacher 
through a series of years; (2) that the full influence of the personality 
of any one teacher has been exhausted by the end of a year, and 
children should therefore come in contact with a new personality 
each year. The answer to both objections is easy and evident. The 
inefficient teacher should be eliminated. The man or woman who 
is unable to teach a group of children through more than one year
-P-A-G-E-28
XXVOI EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
should not be permitted to waste their money, time, and opportunity 
through a single year. A personality which a child between the ages 
of 6 and 12 may exhaust in a year must be very shallow. What the 
child of this age needs is not an ever-changing personality, but a guide 
along the pathway of knowledge to the high road of life. 
IV. Improvement in the rural school.—The principle involved in 
the above can be applied in the country schools only through a longer 
tenure of office for the country-school teacher. Some means must 
be found by which the rural schools may get and keep men and 
women of greater native ability, fuller and better education, more 
maturity and finer skill. The number of class periods per day for 
each teacher in the country school must be limited so that each 
period may be long enough to enable teacher and pupils to work out 
the lesson. For most lessons this can not be done in the 5 or 10 
minutes which can be devoted to each lesson in a school of 25 or 30 
children in six or eight grades and only one teacher. The organiza- 
tion and subject matter of the rural school must be better adjusted 
to the conditions and needs of rural life. 
As a means to these ends I suggest that the rural schools be con- 
solidated as much as can be done without too much inconvenience 
for children or too great a cost for transportation. In a carefully 
laid out school district of 10 or 12 square miles, with a schoolhouse 
at or near the center, few children have to travel more than a mile 
and a half to or from school. Except in the worst winter weather 
this is not too far even for small children to walk. There is now little 
or no reason why the country school for young children should be in 
session when the weather is worst and not in session when the weather 
is good, and walking through country lanes, across fields, or along 
forest paths is pleasant and health giving. In most counties in the 
Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Middle Western States, and in 
many of the more densely populated counties of the Pacific States, 
there is now a school for every 5 or 6 square miles, and in many 
counties a school for every 3 or 4 square miles. The number of 
schools is larger when the population is more dense and smaller 
when it is less dense. In many counties one-room, one-teacher 
schools are scattered along the roads and across the country little 
more than a mile apart. By making a school district of 10 or 12 
square miles (12 square miles means only 34 miles square), two, three, 
or four schools, and sometimes as many as five schools, each with one 
or two teachers at the most, could be brought together into one. 
This consolidation would give to each school a larger number of 
teachers and make it possible to organize the school with principal, 
special teachers for different subjects, fewer daily lesson periods for 
each teacher, a better school spirit among both pupils and teachers, 
more variety in studies, and many other advantages.
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, XXIX 
When such a consolidation is made a good schoolhouse should be 
built, attractive, comfortable, and sanitary, with classrooms, labora- 
tories and library, and an assembly hall large enough, not only to 
seat comfortably all the pupils of the school, but also to serve 
as a meeting place for the people of the district. For the prin- 
cipal’s home a house should be built on the school grounds. 
This house should not be expensive, but neat and attractive, a model 
for the community, such a house as any thrifty farmer with good 
taste might hope to build or have built for himself. And as a part 
of the equipment of the school there should be a small farm, from 
4 to 5 acres if in a village or densely populated community, and 
from 25 to 50 acres if in the open country. The principal of the 
school should be required to live in the principal’s home, keep it as 
a model home for the community and cultivate the farm as a model 
farm, with garden, orchard, poultry yard, dairy, and whatever else 
should be found on a well-conducted, well-tilled farm in that com- 
munity. He should put himself into close contact with the agri- 
cultural college and agricultural experiment station of his State, 
the departments of agriculture of State and Nation, farm demonstra- 
tion agents, and other similar agencies, and it should be made their 
duty to help him in every way possible. The use of the house and 
the products of the farm should be given the principal as a part of 
his salary in addition to the salary now paid in money. After a 
satisfactory trial of a year or two a contract should be made with the 
principal for life or good behavior, or at least for a long term of years. 
In this way it would be possible to get and keep in the schools men 
of first-class ability, competent to teach children and to become 
leaders in their communities. The principal of a country school 
should know country life. A large part of country life has to do with 
the cultivation and care of the farm. The best test here as elsewhere 
is the ability to do. The principal of a country school in a farming 
community should be able to cultivate and care for a small farm better, 
or at least as well, as any other man in the community. It may be 
true that ‘‘those who can, do; and those who can’t, teach,” but it 
should not be so. It must not be so if the teacher is to do the work 
and have the influence in the community that he should. 
I am assuming that tho principal of the consolidated country school 
willbeaman. As arule, it should beso. In every school attended 
by large boys there should be at least one man; other teachers may 
wellbewomen. Theincreased prosperity and wealth that would come 
to any community with such a school as would be possible under the 
plan suggested would soon enable it to pay sufficient salaries to obtain 
the services of women of the best native ability, education, training, 
and skill. Of course not many such teachers can be had as long as 
the salaries paid are less than half the wages of fairly good stenogra- ©
-P-A-G-E-30

Xxx EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
phers in city offices or the wages of saleswomen in village stores. In 
many communities the yearly salary of the teacher is now less than 
the cost of feeding a prisoner in the county jail. Under the plan sug- 
gested the principal’s wife might in many instances become the leader 
in the social life of the community and help in making the teacher’s 
home and the school a social center. She might also assist the women 
teachers in extending the school*work to the homes of the district, 
making the work and the care of the homes more intelligent and tying 
the women and their homes to the school as the principal would tie 
the men and their farms. 
Tho plan here suggested would not prove very costly. If bonds 
were issued to pay the first cost of house and land, by the time the 
bonds matured the increase in the value of the land would in most 
communities amount to as much as its first cost and the community 
would have at a comparatively small cost property of a much greater 
permanent value. 
V. Redirection of the work of the rural school.—Courses of study in 
country schools need reconstruction and their work needs redirection. 
As human beings and as citizens, men and women. living in the coun- 
try have the same interests in the humanities (the term is used in its 
broad sense) and the things pertaining to civic life and citizenship 
that all other people have. But as farmers and farmers’ wives, mak- 
ing their living from the soil and living in isolated country homes, 
their interests differ widely from those of men and women of the 
laboring and professional classes in the cities. However the case 
may have been in the past, it has now come about that farmers need 
a fuller, more extensive, more varied and thorough knowledge, a 
more comprehensive grasp of fundamental principles, and a greater 
power of adjustment than men engaged in other professions. The 
same is true of the farmer’s wife as compared with other women. 
Of the chemistry and physics of the soil, of plant and animal life, of 
methods of tillage, of the feeding and care of animals, of plant and 
animal diseases and the means of protection against them, of farm 
machinery and its care and management, of buying and selling, of 
bookkeeping and the business side of farm life, of fertilizing and the 
means of preserving the fertility of the soil, of the breeding of plants 
and animals, of road making and forestry, of the sanitation of the 
farm home, of the best use of the food products of the farm, of the 
care of children in isolated country homes, and of many other things 
on a knowledge of which the success, prosperity, and happiness of 
the farmer and his wife depend, our country schools take little ac- 
count. Their courses of study need to be remade on the basis of 
what the farmer needs to know, and their teaching must take into 
consideration the environment and the raw material of experience of 
the country boy and girl. This bureau is undertaking a careful study
-P-A-G-E-31
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, XXXI 
of the farmers’ needs, through which study, with the help of members 
of the Department of Agriculture and teachers interested in the sub- 
ject, it hopes to work out a new content of subject matter for the 
rural schools of the country. 
VI. Home gardening for town children.—There is need of suitable 
educative, purposeful, productive occupation for millions of school 
_ children in our cities, towns, manufacturing villages, and surburban 
districts who now have no proper employment out of school hours. 
In the cities, towns, manufacturing villages, and suburban com- 
munities of the United States there are approximately 13,000,000 
children between the ages of 6 and 20. Of these, about 9,750,000 
are enrolled in the public and private schools. The average daily 
attendance is approximately 6,500,000, two-thirds of the enrollment 
and one-half of the school population. The average length of school 
tecm in the cities is 180 days. The average attendance is 120 days. 
Probably 5 per cent of these children are away from home during 
the summer vacation months with their parents at summer resorts 
or visiting in the country. Between 5 and 10 per cent are employed 
in some useful, healthful, productive occupation. Eighty-five per 
cent remain at home without proper employment for any large part 
of their time. Most of them have little opportunity for play. Some 
of them work a portion of the time at occupations at which they earn 
very little and which are not suited for children of their age. The 
dangers of idleness and unsuitable occupation are very great for all. 
A large majority belong to families the members of which must earn 
their living by their daily labor and whose earnings are so meager 
that anything which can be added by the children is much needed. 
Many of them are cold in winter, and must go hungry much of the 
time. More of them live in small, crowded rooms and in poorly 
furnished homes. More than two-thirds of them leave school at 14 
years of age or earlier, to become breadwinners. Because of lack of 
proper contact with nature and the experience which comes from 
suitable, purposeful, productive occupations, most of them do not 
get from their years in school such education as they should. 
Home gardening done by the children under the direction of the 
schools seems to offer what is needed. In all of the manufacturing 
villages, surburban communities, and smaller towns, and in the out- 
skirts of the larger towns and cities, there is much valuable land in 
back yards, vacant lots, and elsewhere which might be used for this 
purpose. In every school in a community of this kind there should 
be at least one teacher who knows gardening both theoretically and 
practically. This teacher, who should, of course, be employed 12 
months in the year, should teach the elementary sciences in the schools 
during school hours and should, out of school hours, direct the home 
gardening of the children between the ages of 6 or 7 and 14 or 15.

  XXXII EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Hf possible the teacher should have the assistance of an expert gar- 
dener, so that the work may be done in the most practical and profit- 
able way. The teacher and the gardener should help the children 
find the plots of ground near their homes best suited for garden work, 
aid them by some cooperative method in having the lots properly 
plowed and prepared for cultivation, help them select seeds, and 
show them how to plant, cultivate, and harvest, so as to obtain the 
best results. The teacher should spend the afternoons and Saturdays 
of winter, spring, and fall, when school is in session, and all of the 
vacation days of summer, if there are summer vacations, visiting the 
children in their homes, directing their work, and giving to each child 
such help as it most needs. Once a week or oftener, during the vaca- 
tion months, the teacher should assemble the children in groups for 
a discussion of their work and of the principles and methods involved 
Vegetables, berries, and fruits grown should be used first as food for 
the children and their families; then the surplus should be marketed 
to the best advantage. Through the help of the teacher this can be 
done in a cooperative way. Ten or 15 cents’ worth of vegetables each 
day from the gardens of 200 children would amount to $20 or $30. 
In summer and fall, when the surplus is large and can not be marketed 
to advantage, the teacher should direct and help the children in 
canning and preserving for winter home use or for sale. The canning 
and tomato clubs of the Southern States have already shown what 
can be done in this way. 
It is difficult to estimate all the results of this plan once it is in full 
operation throughout the country. For the children it will mean 
health, strength, joy in work, habits of industry, an understanding 
of the value of money as measured in terms of labor, and such knowl- 
edge of the phenomena and forces of nature as must: be had for an 
understanding of most of their school lessons. They will also learn 
something at least of the fundamental principle of morality, that 
every man and woman must make his or her own living; must, by 
some kind of labor of head, hand, or heart, contribute to the com- 
mon wealth as much as he or she takes from it; must pay in some 
kind of coin for what he or she gets. 
The economic and sociological results are also worthy of considera- 
tion. Experiments already made show that with proper direction 
an average child of the ages contemplated can produce on an eighth 
of an acre of land from $50 to $100 worth of vegetables. A third of 
the children in the city schools of the United States might easily 
produce $300,000,000 a year. 
This plan in full operation would offer a valuable supplement to 
the child-labor laws. A proper substitute for hurtful child labor is 
only less desirable than its prohibition. A boy 10 or 12 years old, 
with a small plot of land, working under careful direction, can pro- 
         
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, XXxur 
duce more for the support of the family than could be purchased with 
the same boy’s wages working in factory, shop, or mill. Children 
should not be ground in the mills, nor sweated in the factories and 
shops; their strength should not be sapped and their nerves racked 
by working in the heat and dust and noise of indoors; yet all children 
should learn to work. It is good for them and they joy in it. 
This plan in operation would do much to solve the problem of the 
idle negro. A large part of the negroes of the Southern States live 
on the outskirts of cities and small towns. Their cabin homes are 
frequently on large lots and surrounded with vacant lots covered with 
weeds and rubbish. During the vacation months the negro children 
roam idly on the streets, falling into mischief and vice. Under proper 
direction they might make, on back yards and vacant lots, enough to 
support themselves and more. Their parents might then put into 
savings banks a good part of their earnings. With the money thus 
accumulated they could buy or build their own homes and gain some 
degree of that independence necessary for good citizenship for men and 
women of anyrace. The children would be kept from vice and would 
gain habits of industry. . Incidentally these negro quarters would be 
changed from places of ugliness to places of beauty. 
Probably the most valuable result of this plan would be found in 
the fact that it would make it easy for most children to attend school 
three or four years longer than they now do, a thing more and more 
desirable, since education for life and citizenship in our industrial, 
civic, and social democracy can not be obtained before the age of 
adolescence. In some way all children must have instruction and 
training after the years of childhood, or state and society must suffer 
for the failure. Ifa child can contribute to its support while in school, 
it may remain in school much longer than if it must be carried as a 
dead weight until it quits school to go to work. 
The fact that a generation of men and women would be produced 
who would find their recreation after the close of their labor day of 
eight hours in profitable home gardening is not the least important 
reason for the introduction of this plan. 
Compared with the results, the cost would be inconsiderable. No 
addition to the number of teachers would be required. It would 
only be necessary to require different preparation for one teacher in 
each school. Fifty thousand such teachers would be sufficient for 
all the city, town, and manufacturing village schools in the United 
States. To add $500 to the salary of one teacher in each school, in 
order to retain his services throughout the entire twelve months, 
would require an additional expenditure of $25,000,000, only one- 
twelfth of the present total cost of these schools and less than one- 
eighth of the total value of what might easily be produced by the 
healthful, joyous, educative labor of children who now spend much  
-P-A-G-E-34
  XXXIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
more than half of their waking hours in idleness, hurtful to them 
physically, mentally, and morally. : 
VII. Schools and the summer vacation.—The average school term in 
the United States, even in the cities, is shorter than in many other 
countries. There is a growing sentiment in favor of longer terms for 
city schools and even for continuous session with brief vacations, 
probably at Christmas and Easter and in midsummer. 
As already stated, there are in the cities, towns, manufacturing 
villages, and unincorporated suburban communities of the United 
States, approximately 13,000,000 children between the ages of 6 and 
20, more than 9,500,000 of whom are enrolled in public and private 
schools. The average daily attendance is not much in excess of 6,500,- 
000. These children are taught by approximately 300,000 teachers 
at a cost for all purposes of approximately $300,000,000. City schools 
are in session an average of about 180 days exclusive of holidays. 
The average school day is five hours. Children who attend school 
regularly and without tardiness have 900 hours of schooling in the year. 
The average attendance of those enrolled is 120 days, or 600 hours. 
There are in the year 8,760 hours, 5,110 waking hours for children 
who sleep 10 hours a day. Children who attend the full time are in 
the school a little less than one-third of the waking hours of 180 days 
and not in school at all 185 days. The average attendance is only 
about one-third of the waking hours of 120 days, with no attendance 
on 245 days. Children who attend all of the school hours of the year 
are in school 900 hours, and out of school 4,210 waking hours; the 
average is 600 hours in school and 4,510 waking hours out of the school. 
Probably 15 per cent of these children are away from home during 
the summer vacation months or have useful employment, and 85 
per cent or more are at home without useful occupation. They 
spend the time in idleness on the streets and alleys, without guidance, 
on vacant lots, or swelter in crowded houses and on superheated 
streets. Much that was learned at school is forgotten. Many of 
the children become criminals, and still more form habits of idleness. 
The schools which are established and maintained for the purpose 
of educating children into manhood and womanhood, of preparing 
them for society and citizenship, and of giving them such knowledge 
and training as will enable them to make an honest living, should 
provide some kind of instruction for these children through what is 
now, in most cities, a long, wasteful vacation. I believe no one will 
claim that the addition of 400 or 500 hours to the number now spent 
in school would be a burden to any child. The addition of 3 school 
months of 5 hours a day would mean only 300 hours more in the 
school year for children attending regularly and promptly, and only 
200 hours for the average child on the basis of present attendance. 
This would give 1,200 hours for children attending the full time and
-P-A-G-E-35
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXKV 
800 hours for the average child; of course, much less than this for 
many. 
Possibly the school day in the summer term should be not more 
than four hours; that is from 7 or 8 o’clock to 11 or 12 o’clock in the 
forenoon. School work can be done much better during these hours 
in the summer than in the present school hours of the winter months. 
Attendance is easier and buildings do not need to be heated. It 
might be necessary to change the school work, so as to give more 
laboratory and shopwork and less of the ordinary bookwork during 
the summer sessions than in the winter. Children attending the 
summer session under these conditions would, no doubt, be much 
happier and healthier than they are now when turned loose on 
streets and alleys with nothing to do. It is a mistake to suppose 
that children do not like to work. Children do like to work at what- 
ever is of real benefit to them until they learn to be idle. 
Careful studies made in different parts of the country and in 
schools of different kinds indicate that children really do not study in 
school more than an average of 3 hours a day, whatever may be the 
ength of the daily session. For children in the primary grades the 
time is less; for the high-school grades, somewhat more. This 
includes not only the time children give to their studies out of class 
but the time when they are really attending to their work in class. 
This indicates the desirability of reorganizing school work in such 
way as to give three hours a day for intensive school work of the 
ordinary type, and to provide four or five hours of productive work 
suited to the capacities of the children either at home, in shops under 
good conditions, in outdoor gardens, or in shops provided by the 
school. With this kind of organization it would be very easy for 
children to do ordinary school work three hours a day six days in 
the week, through 11 calendar months in the year, and at the same 
time contribute largely to their own support by well-directed, pro- 
ductive, educational work, either at home or in the school, thus 
making it possible for the great majority of children to remain in 
school throughout the high-school period. 
The cost of adding the three months of school would be compara- 
tively little. There would be no cost for fuel, the cost of attendance 
would be less, and the additional cost for teachers need not be in 
proportion to the number of days added. Whatever may be the 
terms of the contract, teachers are in fact employed by the year. 
Many of them do not use any large part of the vacation months in 
any profitable way. The addition of an average of $200 to the annual 
salary of the teacher would require a total of only about $60,000,000, 
or about 20 per cent of the total annual cost of the schools. 
For most teachers the additional months in the school would not 
be a hardship, especially if the school days were shortened. Cer-

tainly this would be true if teachers could be relieved of a large 
amount of unnecessary bookkeeping, report making, and the reading 
of unnecessary examination papers, with which they are now bur- 
dened. It would cost very little more to employ teachers by the year, 
each teacher teaching three-quarters or two-thirds of the year after 
the plan already adopted in many colleges and universities, 
VIII. Continued education; part-time plans.—The complex problems 
of our political, civic, industrial, social, and spiritual democracy 
demand of the masses of the people more extensive knowledge of 
facts and principles than can be given by the elementary schools, 
and a discipline and training different from any which can be gained 
in childhood before the years of adolescence. Children learn by imi- 
tation and accept and act on authority. In the pre-adolescent years 
they are unable to reason inductively to great fundamental principles, 
formulate them into words, and reason from them by deduction to 
intelligent practical applications in concrete new instances. But 
this is just what is most needed for the self-guidance required by 
democratic institutions and life. The education possible in child- 
hood may be sufficient for citizenship in a benevolent despotism 
where a “‘little father” rules over his “children,” in a society of rigid 
and unyielding stratification, in a feudalistic industrial organization 
in which the masses of people are only unthinking “hands,” and in a 
spiritual despotism in which freedom of thought is unknown; but 
democratic government, government of the people, by the people, 
and for the people, is manhood government. Democratic institu- 
tions of whatever kind demand of all who participate in them such 
self-guidance as is impossible without an understanding of general 
principles and the habit of consecutive, abstract reasoning and indi- 
vidual initiative and self-restraint. 
We must find some way of continuing the education of the great 
majority of children through the high-school period, through the 
years of early and middle adolescence. Under present economic 
conditions this will be possible only when we can find or devise some 
way by which boys and girls may contribute to their own support 
while attending school, or of continuing their studies out of school. 
Jn rural farming communities this is comparatively easy. Where 
good high schools are maintained in such communities and there are 
good elementary scliools to prepare for them the per cent of high- 
school attendance is much larger than in most cities and manufactur- 
ing towns. The solution of this problem in cities and towns will 
probably be found in some part-time attendance plan involving the 
principles applied in the engineering school of the University of 
Cincinnati. In a small cotton-mill town in South Carolina for 
several years a school has been conducted for children of mill age.
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE COMMISSIONER'S INTRODUCTION. XXXVII 
The pupils are divided into two equal groups. While the children 
of one group are in school, those of the other group are working in 
the mills, the groups alternating weekly between school and mill, 25 
weeks in school and 25 weeks in the mill each year. Boys and girls, 
teachers and mill foremen all agree that the plan is successful. The 
school work is satisfactory, and the boys and girls earn enough by 
their labor in the mill to pay for their food, clothing, and shelter. 
The pedagogical principles involved are sound, and with the intelli- 
gent and hearty cooperation of parents, teachers, school officers, and 
employers it might be applied in all cities, towns, and manufacturing 
communities. The cost would be small in proportion to results. In 
some places a school day of two or three hours, with four or five hours 
of productive work, might be found more practicable. Such a plan 
has been proposed for the schools of the city of Ogden, Utah, and is 
already in operation to a limited extent in several places. 
TX. Vocational education—With the disappearance of the appren- 
ticeship system and the growing demand for skilled labor in many 
trades and industries, the demand for vocational education becomes 
more insistent. Not only must the courses of instruction in all public 
schools be varied and differentiated to meet the varying needs of all 
the children of all the people, they must also be so adjusted as to give 
the information and training necessary for intelligent and successful 
employment in all standard occupations. Whatever is needed to be 
done for the welfare of society in city or State should be taught in 
the public schools, unless it can be taught elsewhere better and more 
economically. 
As yet we know little of vocational education and of the best form 
of organization, support, and management for vocational schools. In 
this matter we have made much less progress than have some other 
countries, from which we may well learn. No doubt we shall need 
to establish many separate trade schools, with an organization in 
many ways unlike that of the public schools we now have. We shall 
need to foster trade schools maintained by manufacturing and mer- 
cantile corporations. We shall need to organize many short trade 
courses in the ordinary public schools and make liberal concessions 
as to time of the attendance of children upon them. We shall 
probably need to inaugurate a system of continuation schools modeled 
after those of Munich and other European cities. All this will require 
the hearty cooperation of school officers and employers of skilled 
labor. Whatever may be the solution of the problem of vocational 
education, it is quite clear that two things should be held firmly in 
mind: (1) that all education is one thing and not many, and that 
vocational schools are an integral part of our common school system; 
(2) that whatever may be the trade by which one makes a living,
-P-A-G-E-38
    XXXVIII EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
humanity and citizenship, with all their meaning and requirements, 
are common to all, and must be considered in the education of all 
individuals and classes. 
X. County libraries.—The education of the schools, however full 
and complete it may be, can never be considered sufficient for the 
needs of the people in a country like ours. It must be supplemented 
by constant reading during and after school years. This supplemen- 
tary reading can not be so abundant and so well directed as it should 
be without collections of well-selected books accessible to all the 
people. 
Despite all progress in the establishment of libraries through the 
assistance of Mr. Carnegie and others within the last quarter of a cen- 
tury, the great majority of the people of the United States are still 
without access to any adequate collection of books. Most of the 
cities having a population of 25,000 or more and many smaller cities 
have good public libraries, but most of these are only for the people 
living within the corporate limits of the cities or within their imme- 
diate suburbs. Most of the people living in small towns, villages, 
and the open country are still without library facilities. In many 
parts of the country there are circulating libraries. These do much 
good, but they can not take the place of permanent libraries. 
There is great need for county libraries located at county seats with 
branches in all the towns and villages of the county and in the public 
schools. To establish such libraries should be our next, step in 
library development. One wonders why more effort has not been 
made to establish libraries for country people or to open city libraries 
for theiruse. People living in the country, particularly young people 
in the country, have more time to read than city people, and as arule 
they are, I believe, interested in a better class of literature. Boys 
on the farm and girls in the farm home have many hours every week 
in the year and frequently whole days and weeks which they might 
‘give to reading. They are free from the dissipation of the city. 
Their close contact with nature and the fundamental needs of life 
gives them an intelligént interest in biography, history, books of 
travel, and books of popular science. The larger interest in scientific 
agriculture developed in recent years has made many farmers eager 
for books that will help them in the cultivation of the soil, the care of 
live stock, the marketing of products, and many other activities and 
interests of farm life. The extension of good roads, the telephone, 
and the newspaper, and the closer contact of political and economic 
life have created a desire for books on political and social questions. 
Country people are no longer satisfied with the campaign stump 
speech and the more or less partisan newspaper. 
Here is an opportunity for men of moderate wealth to build for 
themselves lasting monuments and at the same time do much good
-P-A-G-E-39
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XXXIX 
by making donations of from $25,000 to $50,000 for county library 
buildings, on condition that the county will levy a tax for the up- 
keep of the library and its branches. 
Something like this has already been done in a few counties in 
different parts of the country, notably in Ohio and California. One 
of the best examples of cooperation in the establishment and mainte- 
nance of a county library is in Van Wert County, Ohio. In this 
county John Sanford Brumback, a citizen and business man of the 
county seat, left in his will a fund which, by his heirs, was increased 
to $50,000, for the erection of a public library building. The city 
gave a site for the building in its central park. A library association 
which had accumulated a small collection of books donated this col- 
lection to the library and the county authorities levied a tax on all 
the property of the county for the purchase of books and the care 
of the library. The collection is now large and varied enough to 
offer reading matter to all the people of the county whatever their 
interests may be. The reading rooms are open to the people of the 
county. Eighteen or 20 branch libraries are maintained in villages 
and at crossroads, and books are distributed through the public 
schools of the county. In this way all the people of the county are 
supplied with good reading matter at very small cost. Every county 
in the United States ought to have sucha library. Every town and 
city library ought to make some arrangement by which its books 
would be free to the people of the county in which the libraries are 
located. 
With county libraries in all its county seats and their branches in 
all its villages and schools, a State might well organize these into a 
system and supplement them by establishing and maintaining at the 
capital city a State library open to all the people of the State, where 
the rarer and more costly books, which are less frequently called for 
than others, but which every library must have on its shelves or 
within easy reach if it is to be relied upon for help by all the people, 
might be kept in such numbers as may be necessary to enable it to 
respond to the demands of county libraries. 
XI. Better organization in higher education.—There is much need 
of better organization of our systems of higher education, more 
definite standards for admission to and graduation from college, and 
a better understood differentiation in the field and work of colleges 
of different kinds and widely different equipment and wealth. : 
There are in the United States more than 600 universities, colleges, 
and other institutions which confer on students the bachelor’s degree 
at the end of a course of study of three or four years. The endow- 
ment and equipment of many of these are such as to enable them 
to do thoroughly and well four years of work, and their standards are 
such as to give a fairly definite meaning to the degrees conferred by
-P-A-G-E-40
  XL EDUCATION REPORT, 1918. 
them. Many have incomes so small and equipment so meager that 
it is impossible for them to do with any degree of satisfaction the 
work which should be expected of a standard college. Of many the 
standards of admission and graduation are so low and uncertain that 
the diplomas and degrees conferred by them have no definite meaning. 
For the six hundred and more colleges the requirements for admis- 
sion vary from the 16 units of a good high-school course of four 
years down to the uncertain acquirements of boys and girls who have 
had only such instruction and training as can be gained in the elemen- 
tary schools of country. and village communities. The requirements 
for graduation vary from four years of college work based on the four 
years of good high-school work done under teachers of first-class 
ability with the help of well-equipped laboratories and libraries down 
to the indefinite requirements of the institutions with no standards of 
admission, poorly prepared instructors, and the most meager equip- 
ment of laboratories and libraries, and whose students go out with 
diplomas and degrees after having had less instruction and training 
than that which may be had in the better high schools. Because of 
this wide variation in standards American college diplomas and 
degrees have no definite meaning at home or abroad. 
The poorer institutions with small equipment are giving most of 
their time, attention, and strength to a very few students in their 
junior and senior classes, while the larger number of students in the 
lower classes receive comparatively little attention. Much of the 
work which they attempt to do can not be done effectively because 
of lack of library and laboratory equipment. Some of the richer 
colleges and universities center their attention and efforts on their 
large groups of graduate students and undergraduates in the upper 
classes, while the thousands of students in their overcrowded fresh- 
man and sophomore classes do less satisfactory work than they might 
do under better conditions in smaller institutions. In both classes of 
institutions freshman and sophomore students are taught largely by 
professors, assistants, and instructors of less ability and with less 
experience than those who direct and instruct the higher classes. 
Many of the students in the freshman class are, after all, only boys and 
girls who a few months ago were working in the public high schools 
under high-school conditions, quite different from the conditions 
which obtain in the larger and richer colleges. These younger 
students especially feel the lack of sympathetic, personal contact 
with men and women of strong personality and high ideals and broad- 
sympathies. For these reasons, these students get much less than 
they should out of their first years in college, Many of them lose 
their inspiration, fail in their class work, become discouraged, and 
quit. Records show that approximately 60 per cent of those who 
enter the freshman class fall out before the beginning of the junior
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, XLI 
year. There is need both that colleges with small incomes and 
meager equipment should cease to try to do the advanced work 
requiring large faculties and costly equipment and that students 
of freshman and sophomore years, who constitute a large majority 
of the college students, should be given more consideration than 
they are now given. To this end two or three hundred of the 
smaller colleges should become junior colleges and give all their 
strength to the work of the first two college years. The junior 
colleges should require for admission the same preparation that is 
required by any standard college. If for any reason it should be 
necessary for them to do work of a lower grade, it should be done in 
an academy or a preparatory school definitely recognized as such. 
The equipment in laboratories and libraries necessary for good work 
in the freshman and sophomore classes is much less costly than that 
which is needed for good work in the junior and senior classes. 
Instructors of students should be men and women of good scholarship. 
They should havea firm grasp on the principles of education, experience 
and skill in teaching, a comprehensive knowledge of life, strong person- 
ality, broad sympathy, and ability to inspire students with a desire for 
knowledge and to encourage them to do their best work. To get the 
help and services of such men and women will require larger salaries 
than the smaller colleges can pay so long as they continue to spread 
their work over the full four years. But they might be had if these 
colleges would use all their income available for salaries in employing 
a few men and women of first-class ability for lower class work. A 
junior college with an annual income of forty or fifty thousand dollars 
might well divide this among ten or a dozen instructors, paying them 
from four to six thousand dollars each. 
Under these conditions students would accomplish in two years 
little less than is now accomplished by most in three years. A much 
larger per cent of those entering college would remain through the 
second year and the number gaining such impetus as would carry 
them through the higher classes would be very much larger than it 
is now. The work and opportunity of the junior college here sug- 
gested are in every way worthy of any institution of comparatively 
small means. 
An objection frequently urged against the junior college is that 
students would have to leave without a degree. This objection 
might be met in two ways. First, by adopting some new degree, 
such as that of an Associate in Arts, or Associate in Science, as has 
been suggested by various persons, or second, by giving the bache- 
lor’s degree at the end of two years and the master’s degree at the 
end of the four years of full college work. Either of these plans would 
provide recognition of the efforts of the large number of college stu- 
dents who now leave college without a degree. More than two-
-P-A-G-E-42
  XLIL EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
thirds of them do. The tendency toward dividing our 12 years of 
elementary and secondary schooling into two periods of six years 
each is increasing, and within a few years the practice will no doubt 
become quitecommon. As has already been pointed out, the general 
_ adoption of this plan, accompanied by more care in the selection of 
high-school teachers and the promotion of elementary teachers with 
their children from grade to grade instead of the present practice of 
promoting children from teacher to teacher, will result in a degree 
of scholarship and training for high-school graduates which would 
be represented by an addition of one or two years to the present 12 
years of elementary and high-school training under present condi- 
tions. With this better preparation and the better work made pos- 
sible in the first two years of the junior college, the bachelor’s degree 
given at the end of these two years would mean little less, and in 
many instances probably more, than it now means when given at the 
end of four years. The better work done by the junior colleges 
would, of course, make the larger colleges with their full courses of 
four years give more attention than they now do to their lower classes. 
Many of the older and better colleges with long-established repu- 
tation for thorough and honest work, but whose incomes are small as 
compared with the larger State universities and the more richly 
endowed private institutions, should no doubt continue to do four 
years of college work, but instead of offering a large variety of courses 
in widely different subjects and thus reducing to a small minimum 
the amount of funds that can be used in any one faculty, should con- 
centrate their efforts on one group of subjects, thus enabling them 
to do this work with the greatest possible efficiency and to gain a 
reputation which would attract to them young men and women 
interested in that particular group of subjects. 
The readjustments here suggested would even add very largely to 
the value and effectiveness of our system of higher education. Should 
the better work of the junior colleges centering their strength and 
efforts on the first two years of college work result in a smaller attend- 
ance in those years in the larger and richer institutions, these insti- 
tutions would thereby be able to do more and better work in the later 
years and for graduate students. 
XII. Better teachers—In schools of all grades and kinds results 
must depend primarily and almost wholly on the teacher. There 
is much truth in the sayings: ‘‘As is the teacher, so is the school,” 
“The teacher is the school,” ‘‘The teacher makes the school and, 
like every other creator, makes it in his own image and likeness.” 
The efforts of legislatures, governors, school officers, and people for 
the education of the children of the State, city, or district, all end in 
bringing together groups of children with men and women called 
teachers. Neither officers, laws, taxpayers, money, or houses teach:
-P-A-G-E-43
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XLII 
they only provide the situation. What comes out of the situation 
must depend on the teacher. If the teacher is efficient, the results 
may in some degree approximate the ideals and expectations of the 
people and the needs of society and State. If the teacher is inefficient, 
then legislation is in vain, the money paid for schools is wasted, the 
time and opportunity of the children are frittered away, the hopes 
of parents are blasted, and society and State are cheated out of that 
which they have paid for, the right education and training of their 
future members and citizens. Since in a democracy everything 
waits on the education of the people, since the school is the most 
important agency of education, and since the character and results 
of the school depend on the teacher, the selection and preparation 
of teachers for its schools become therefore the most important task 
and function of the democracy. If a democracy succeeds in this, 
then it succeeds; if it fails in this, then it fails in all and must soon 
give place to some form of government, society, and industrial organ- 
jzation less dependent on the intelligence, virtue, skill, and good 
will of all the people. Civilization and progress have long halted 
and still go forward more slowly than they should because too little 
attention has been and is given to this all-important factor. 
The teachers of children and youth should be well born. They 
should be men and women of good native ability with abundant 
vitality and strong well-balanced nervous organization, positive 
and aggressive rather than negative and passive. As. President 
Daniel Coit Gilman used to say, they should be ‘‘strong men, tall 
men, broad-shouldered men, sun-crowned men,” or women like 
unto them. They should be honest men and women, intellectually 
honest, truth lovers and truth seekers, willing and eager to find the 
truth wherever it may be and to teach it whatever it may be, knowing 
that the truth and only the truth can give strength and freedom, 
knowing that truth is sacred however newly discovered, and false- 
hood and a lie, false however old and however intimately interwoven 
with social, political, civic, industrial, economic, educational and 
religious life and institutions, and however dear and flattering to 
the individual. They should be industrious, hard working men and 
women, willing to give time and energy that they may guide their 
pupils and students most surely to the fountains of knowledge and 
in the paths of life. They should be sympathetic men and women, 
broad minded, the windows of their souls open, fully appreciative of 
the true, the beautiful and the good wherever found, and patient of 
faults and failings and failures. They should be men and women 
of fine culture, readers of the great books, lovers of the best in art, 
sensitive to the beauties and sublimities of nature, ever eager for 
companionship with men and women of culture and sterling worth. 
They should be practical men and women with the rare gift of uncom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  XLIV EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
mon common sense. They should be democratic men and women 
witha full appreciation of the dignity and worth of humanity in every 
race and every individual, unwilling to accept for themselves that 
which any other man or woman may not have on equal terms, and 
striving to so conduct themselves toward others that if their con- 
duct and the principles out of which it grows should beeome law, 
they whould be willing to abide thereby. They should know well 
the subjects they teach, not as pupilsreaching up and trying to under- 
stand and remember, but as masters, whose knowledge must be com- 
prehensively analytic and synthetic. They should be able to teach 
and speak as: having authority and not as the scribes. They should 
know the children whom they teach and something of the laws of the 
development of their minds so as to be able at least to detect the 
budding points of their souls, the nascent stages of interest so impor- 
tant: in all education, and to assist those whom they teach to acquire 
both knowledge and wisdom. They should have an intelligent 
grasp on the fundamental principles of education and that skill in 
teaching which comes only from intelligent experience guided by the 
lessons of the history of education. They should be no triflers but 
earnest men and women, since they deal with our most valuable 
possessions, time, opportunity, and life itself. They should not be 
timeservers but farseeing, since they build, not for the present but 
for the future, and determine the destinies of individuals, society, 
State, and Nation. 
That the value of the services of such men and women can never 
be measured in money may be true, but we should not expect to 
obtain such services for our schools without paying for them at least 
enough to enable those who serve to live. As yet the teacher is the 
poorest paid servant of society. The annual average salary of teach- 
ers in the elementary and secondary schools of the United States in 
city and country is $491.62—for men $616.83, for women $458.51. 
I think we may not expect to get and retain for our schools the 
services of men and women of the type I have indicated for less than 
the wages of a washerwoman, less by half than the wages of a mail 
earrier, and less by two-thirds than the wages of a carpenter, a brick- 
layer, or a plumber. We profess to believe in education and talk of 
our teachers as the standing army of the Republic, and of our school- 
houses as the fortifications which hold back the invasions of igno- 
rance, vice, anarchy, and economic inefficiency, but the salaries of 
teachers are still criminally low, and the sum total of expenditures for 
schools pitifully and absurdly small. Years ago Dr. Charles W. 
Eliot ealled attention to the fact that for the individual in civilized 
society and for that society itself, education is as important a factor 
in life as food, clothing, or shelter, and should have as large a claim 
on the resources of the individual and society. In these times of
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XLV 
the high cost of living and low salaries of teachers, we are far from 
the ideal of devoting as much money to the support of schools as we 
pay for either food, clothing, or shelter. 
Nor may we hope to have competent teachers at whatever salary 
for all our schools until we establish and maintain a larger number of 
training schools for teachers. Though we have accepted the doc- 
trine of public education at the expense of the public, we have not 
yet accepted the responsibility of preparing at public expense. a suffi- 
cient number of competent teachers to supply all the schools, so that 
money, time, and opportunity may not be lost. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATION IN POLICY OF EDUCATION FOR 
NATIVES OF ALASKA. 
I wish to call attention to the section on the education of natives 
in Alaska in this report (pp. 632-642). A careful reading of this 
section and of the reports of schools, medical relief, and reindeer 
service for natives in Alaska in past years reveals the fact which per- 
sonal investigation confirms, that the administration of these inter- 
ests has been wise and the results good. The more I see and learn 
of what has been done for the natives of Alaska with small appropri- 
ations, under my predecessors in office, the more I am convinced of 
the value of their work. I have no adverse criticism to make of any- 
thing they have done, but the time has now come when we should 
begin a new policy, for which the work done has prepared the way. 
The natives of Alaska, about 25,000 in number, are spread over 
more than 350,000 miles of the 590,000 square miles of the Territory. 
Their small settlements extend along 10,000 miles of coast and on 
both sides of the Yukon River and its tributaries, for a distance of 
more than 2,500 miles. If the map of Alaska were spread on the 
map of the United States, our Government schools would fall in 21 
different States. One of our supervision districts contains a full hun- 
dred thousand square miles, the others average more than 65,000 
square miles each. Of the natives of Alaska, approximately 11,000 
belong to 6 tribes of Indians in southeastern and southern Alaska 
and in the valley of the Yukon. About 11,000 are Eskimos, on the 
western and northwestern coast, along the Bering Sea, the Bering 
Straits, and the Artic Ocean. Something more than 3,000 are Aleuts 
and mixed races scattered through the Aleutian Islands. 
Until recently the natives of Alaska lived wholly by hunting and 
fishing. For generations they have been exploited by white traders, 
who have bought their furs and fish and sold them goods at their 
own. prices, frequently a small fraction of the true value of articles 
bought and many times the true value of goods sold. Necessarily a 
hardy people, their health and strength have in recent years been
-P-A-G-E-46
XLVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
affected by the white man’s diseases and the white man’s liquors. 
They are a peaceable, law-abiding, faithful, and trustworthy people. 
They have never rebelled against the Government or authority of the 
United States, and no money has been spent in Alaska in defending 
white settlements against attacks by the natives. The Government 
teachers, often single women, live in their scattered villages, far from 
white settlements and from the protection of forts and police force, 
unharmed and unafraid. 
The United States bought Alaska from Russia and paid to Russia 
the purchase money. Nothing has ever been paid to the natives for 
their rights in the soil and the waters. Timberlands, hunting 
grounds, mining claims, and fishing waters have been taken without 
compensation. The natives therefore have no large funds on which 
interest is paid, as have many Indian tribes in the States; no revenues 
from oil and coal lands, from gold fields and copper mines, nor from 
forest reserves and fishing grounds come to them in royalties. From 
the United States Government they have received only the small 
amount appropriated for education and for the purchase and care of 
reindeer, administered by the Bureau of Education, and an occasional 
small fund as relief from disaster by volcano, storms, and floods. 
The total appropriation for education, including medical relief and 
support of the destitute, through 30 years, from July 1, 1884, to 
June 30, 1914, has been $2,419,438.46, an average of $80,485.75 a 
year, out of which for 10 years the cost of schools for white 
children was taken. The total appropriation for reindeer from 
1892, when the importation of deer was begun, to June 30, 1914, is 
$302,000; the title in reindeer to the value of $96,325 still lies in the 
Government. If the money used for the education of white children 
and the value of the reindeer still owned by the Government be 
deducted, the Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts of Alaska have cost the 
Federal Government less than $50,000 a year from the time of the 
purchase of Alaska until now—less than $2 per person per year; for 
the whole period of 47 years only as much per capita as our Govern- 
ment appropriates in two years for the Indians of the States. The 
current appropriations for natives in Alaska, $205,000, including the 
care of the Government’s reindeer herd of approximately 4,000 deer, 
is at the rate of $8.56 per capita. This is small when compared with 
the appropriations for Indians in the States, which is for all purposes 
$47.54 per capita; $12.31 per capita of the total population for the 
support of Indian schools, not including the $162,000 for the school 
at Carlisle, Pa., although many Indian children of the States attend 
the public schools supported by the State and municipal govern- 
ments; $14.35 per capita for purposes similar to those for which 
Alaskan appropriations are made. This comparison of appropria- 
tions is made not in criticism of our more liberal policy toward these

  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XLVIL 
Indians, but to suggest the need of larger appropriations than are 
now made for the natives of Alaska, who live under harder conditions. 
Appropriations for natives in Alaska for the current year fall under 
two heads—education of natives in Alaska, $200,000; reindeer for 
Alaska, $5,000. The work of the bureau is, however, of four kinds— 
education, medical relief, relief of destitution, and distribution of 
reindeer and training herders. The appropriation of $200,000 covers 
the first three of these items. For the present fiscal year the allot- 
ment for medical relief is $36,000, and for relief of destitution $1,800, 
leaving only $162,200 for education, including the expenses of offices 
at Washington, Seattle, and Nome, the cost of buildings and repairs, 
supplies, fuel, and freight. Freight rates to the western and north- 
western sections and to the upper Yukon are heavy. 
With our fuller knowledge of health conditions of the natives the 
need for larger funds for medical relief becomes more apparent. It 
is hard to let men, women, and children die without attendance. 
As the need for a larger fund for medical relief has grown, it has 
become necessary to close schools already established. Six schools 
in villages having a population of approximately 800 were closed last 
fall. The children of these villages are now without schools and the 
people without the advice and help of the teachers in matters per- 
taining to sanitation, economy, and moral life. 
Of these 5,405 native children (partly estimated) in Alaska, 3,500 
are this year in Government schools, 300 in 6 mission schools, 60 in 
2 schools supported by the Department of Commerce on the Seal 
Islands, and about 150 in Government boarding schools in the States, 
leaving approximately 1,400 not in school anywhere. Since prac- 
tically all the children of every village in which there is a school are . 
enrolled, these 1,400 children are in villages or settlements in which 
no schools are maintained. About 200 of these are in villages in 
which schools have been closed for want of funds; nearly 600 are in 
other places large enough to justify the establishment and mainte- 
nance of schools; more than 600 live in scattered settlements of 
from 2.to 5 or 6 houses or belong to wandering bands. These last 
it will be very difficult or impossible to reach until they can be 
brought together into larger communities, as suggested below. 
The 5,500 Indians of southeastern Alaska live in 25 or 30 settle- 
ments, ranging in size from 625 at Metlakahtla on Annetto Island 
down to 10 or 15 in remote places. We now have or have had 24 
schools in this section, most of them with only one teacher and 
some with an attendance so small that the relative cost is very large. 
In most of the villages there is no employment for the people lasting 
through the year. In the canning season all the people—men, women, 
and children—go away to the fishing grounds and the canneries, where 
they live in shacks and tents with little comfort and surrounded by 
17726°—xp 1913—voL 1——1v.    
-P-A-G-E-48
Sa a ca iT i 
XLVI EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
much filth. Men and boys make good wages, from $200 to $600 a 
season, catching salmon for the canneries at $15 to $35 a thousand. 
When canned these fish are worth from $250 to $500 a thousand. 
Women and children work in the canneries. In winter many fami- 
lies go to the trapping grounds. For lumber and furniture for their 
houses and for food and clothing natives pay unnecessarily high prices 
to white traders. In the small villages, from which the natives are 
absent a large part of the year, school terms are short, teachers come 
and go, and too often they are not qualified for the most important 
parts of theirwork. Since thenatives have no permanent employment 
at home, their village homes are broken up four or five months in the 
year. Receiving small pay for their labor and paying large prices 
for the necessities of life, they can make only very slow progress in 
social and civic development. The remedy lies, I believe, in bringing 
the people together in villages of from 400 to 600 inhabitants. These 
villages should be located at suitable places on reserves from which 
undesirable classes of white people may be excluded until the natives 
reach a stage of development and gain such knowledge of trade and 
industries as will enable them to deal with white men on terms more 
nearly equal. The five and a half thousand natives of southeastern 
Alaska might well be assembled in 10 or 12 places at most. The 
reserves should be made not for the purpose of fencing Indians in, 
but for keeping out white men who would exploit, debauch, or cor- 
rupt them. Such reserves can now be made without prejudice to 
the legitimate interests of the white settlers. The Territory is large. 
The few thousand square miles needed for the reserves will not be 
missed. On each of these reserves we should lay out a village, 
keeping in mind health, convenience, beauty and attractiveness. 
Ample grounds should be set apart for school and church houses, 
homes for teachers and missionaries, cooperative stores, and such 
industrial plants as may be found suitable to the needs of the place. 
In each such village a man and his wife should be put as teachers, 
and there should be a third teacher who might well be an unmarried 
woman, preferably a relative of the others. The man should have 
sound judgment as to what the natives are capable of doing and 
becoming, and he should become a practical director of the industrial 
life of the men and older boys of the village. His wife should have 
practical knowledge of nursing and be able to direct and help the 
women in making their homes better and cleaner and in caring for 
their children. She should instruct the girls and the older women 
in their homes, in housekeeping, cooking, sewing, and other house- 
hold arts. The third person should be an expert teacher of such 
school subjects as are most practical for the children in their present 
stage of civilization, and living under the conditions necessary to 
their country and climate. For a part of the year, at least, this 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. XLIX 
teacher should have the assistance of the two others in the school 
work. If the village is large and the industries are of such nature 
and quantity as to justify it, there should be a second man to assist 
in directing them. The teachers should remain at their posts all the 
year round, and should be employed with the understanding that 
they will be given permanent tenure as soon as they have proved to be 
competent and their work satisfactory. They should remain at one 
place 8 or 10 years, at least. At some of these villages, probably at 
most of them, small sawmills should be put in by the Government, 
and the natives should be allowed to take them over and pay for 
them in installments, as is now being done at the new consolidated 
village of Hydaburg. This will enable the natives to supply them- 
selves with lumber for houses and board walks (all streets and side- 
walks in this part of Alaska are built of heavy boards), for furniture 
for the Government schoolhouses and for houses for teachers at 
little more than half the price now paid. It would also enable them 
to supply lumber to the canneries and some of the white settlers at 
a good profit. Timber is plentiful, and with a little direction the 
natives soon become expert in making lumber. The large sawmill 
at Sitka is manned by Indians, whose wages run from $3 to $5.50 a 
day. 
Each village should have a shop for building boats and making 
simple, strong, and serviceable furniture. The natives use hundreds 
of rowboats and gasoline launches in fishing and traveling. All the 
highways are water. With a little instruction the people become 
good boat builders. Last summer we traveled hundreds of miles with 
an Indian on a seaworthy boat 50 feet long which he had built himself 
and on which he had installed a gasoline engine of 30 horsepower. 
This man had also built his own house of two stories and 8 or 10 rooms. 
At Sitka I saw natives building boats, trim and neat, and earning $5 
or $6 a day. For the cheap tawdry furniture which the natives now 
buy at high prices they might substitute strong, durable furniture of 
their own make. We should give them plans for theif houses and 
show them how to build them for decency, comfort, and convenience. 
They like to build, and many of their houses are pretentious and com- 
paratively costly. Few of them are sanitary, comfortable, or so built 
as to provide for privacy. The sanitary conditions of most of the 
villages are very bad. With a little help and direction, clean, pure 
water could be provided at each village and some better means of 
disposing of filth. At most of the villages small salmon canneries 
might be made profitable, also small plants for mild-curing and for 
the cold storage of fish. These would give the natives employment 
at home through a much larger part of the year and a larger share 
in the profits from their labor. At a few places, notably at Haines 
and Klukwan on the Chilkat River and at Killisnoo, there is oppor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  L EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
tunity for employment in intensive farming and gardening. At 
Haines last year strawberries from a half acre were sold by a rancher 
for more than $1,400. In the school garden at Klukwan 20 varieties 
of vegetables and grains were grown so successfully as to show that 
they might be cultivated profitably by the natives. Berries grow 
- wild in great profusion. With a small home canning outfit, costing 
not more than $150 delivered, thousands of dollars worth of berries 
and vegetables might be canned for home use and for sale. On the 
Chilkat River and probably elsewhere in southeastern Alaska a few 
cows might be kept for their milk, and it seems probable that goats 
might be herded profitably, as are reindeer farther north. 
Vith a little wise and careful direction in the matter of buying and 
selling, keeping books, and banking, the natives of each village might 
conduct a cooperative store profitably, selling their fish, furs, baskets, 
and trinkets, and buying their clothing and groceries through it, 
thus saving for themselves the large profits which they now pay to 
the traders. In all of these things the Government teachers should 
give instruction and furnish leadership, always without any share in 
the profits of the industry or trading, and without other remuneration, 
than their salaries. The missionaries sent by the churches to these 
villages should cooperate heartily with the teachers in this work. I 
believe they would do so in most instances. 
Many of the Indians, probably most of them, would still go away 
to the fishing and hunting grounds and to the large canneries during 
the season, but some would remain at home engaged in their own 
business, and the village and its homes would not be broken up during 
these months. Gradually the people would take on the ways of a 
more stable civilization. It is easy to believe that in a few years 
they would be able to begin to contribute largely to the support of 
their schools and hospitals. The policy here outlined and already 
begun in the southeastern section contemplates this. 
That this policy is practicable is already proven in the village of 
Metlakahtla, with more than 600 inhabitants, and its sawmill, can- 
neries, and store, until recently managed very successfully by Mr. 
Duncan; in our new consolidated village of Hydaburg, with its saw- 
mill and cooperative store, under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. 
Hawkesworth, Government teachers; in the village of Klukwan, 
where we have as teachers Mr. F. R. Shaver, a man of good practical 
ability, a born mechanic, and a graduate of the Agricultural College 
of the University of Minnesota, his wife a graduate of a Minneapolis 
training school for nurses, and his sister, a widow and a motherly 
woman of 30, with professional training and successful experience 
as a teacher. In two years the Hydaburg people, coming together 
from three villages, have turned a dense forest into a thriving little 
town with a busy wharf, a sawmill that turns them out good lumber 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. Lt 
at a cost of $10 a thousand, neat single-family homes instead of the 
communal houses in which they lived in their old villages, a long 
boarded street of which they are proud as the finest in Alaska, and 
a cooperative store, which the first year made a clear profit of 125 
per cent, paying a cash dividend of 50 per cent and adding 75 per 
cent to the capital stock. 
The cooperative store at Klukwan made a profit of 30 per cent 
last year, although the direction given by the teacher was less than 
at Hydaburg. The capital stock in these stores is divided into shares 
of $10. The teachers are allowed to own only a very small part of 
the stock. Permission to own any at all is given only at the request 
of the natives. No other white man may own any. The banking 
is done in Seattle. 
For convenience and clearness in stating this policy, I have spoken 
only of southeastern Alaska. With necessary modifications to adapt 
it to changing condition it will apply equally well to most of the 
country. Along the Yukon, where the natives live almost wholly 
by hunting and trapping, the reservations would need to be larger 
than elsewhere. Among the northern Eskimos, who live by herding 
reindeer or by fishing and hunting on the ice floes, the settlements 
must needs be smaller than elsewhere. 
That the plan of industrial leadership and cooperation will work 
under the most adverse conditions is indicated by the results of the 
work of our teachers, Mr. and Mrs. H. G. Seller, on Atka Island. 
This is a treeless island in the Aleutian chain, 1,800 miles west of 
Seattle. It has a population of 73 Aleuts, many of whom live in sod 
houses, their only industries fishing, hunting foxes, and making 
baskets. They have nothing to sell except their fox skins and baskets. 
They have been selling their fur skins to the local and passing traders 
at from $5 to $8 each and buying goods at three or four times their 
cost in Seattle. For lumber costing $12 a thousand in Seattle they 
paid $50 a thousand, and for shingles worth $2.25 a thousand in 
Seattle they paid $8 a thousand. Last year under instructions from 
the Bureau of Education, Mr. Seller assisted them in beginning 
cooperative buying and selling. They sent their fox skins to Seattle 
by express and mail and sold them at auction on the fur market at 
prices ranging from $17 to $66. With the proceeds of the sales our 
superintendent of education of natives of Alaska bought and shipped 
to them a quantity of lumber which cost them only $33 a thousand 
delivered on their island. With a continuation of this policy even 
the natives of this barren island may soon be able to live in comfort- 
able houses and possibly contribute toward the support of their 
schools, thus gaining for themselves the feeling of self-helpfulness 
and independence so invaluable to any people. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  LIL EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
It is not expected that this consolidation of settlements and 
establishment of industries can be perfected at once. It must be 
gradual; no compulsion can or should be used. By wise and tactful 
management and with a very small increase in appropriations it can, 
I believe, be well under way in 10 or 15 years, and the population 
now scattered through approximately 150 settlements be brought 
together in not more than 50 or 60 places. Thus the natives may 
become not only self-supporting but also a very valuable part of the 
population of the country. 
Careful investigation will be necessary to determine the best places 
for consolidated settlements. Present settlements, probable future 
developments, physical conditions, affiliations of the people—all 
these and more must be considered. It seems quite certain, how- 
ever, the following places are suited for permanent settlements: 
Metlakahtla on Annette Island, to which the Tsimpseans who have 
wandered away may be brought back; Hydaburg, where the rest of 
the Hydas may be brought; Klukwan, where the smaller settlements 
of Chilkats may be gathered; Klawock, where a cooperative store has 
been started; Killisnoo, or Kake, or Hoonah, where the Thlingets 
may be gathered; some point near Juneau, where the natives now 
living in the outskirts of Juneau and Douglas under slum conditions 
may be brought together; Sitka, an old and prosperous settlement, 
and Port Moller, on the Alaska peninsula. 
HEALTH CONDITIONS AND MEDICAL RELIEF.—AI] who have studied 
health conditions among the natives, including two physicians from 
the Public Health Service, are agreed that for adequate medical treat- 
ment and the establishment of proper health conditions so important 
for the natives and for the white settlers who can not avoid coming 
in contact with them, there is imperative need for approximately 10 
small hospitals in 10 of the most accessible places, one or more sani- 
tariums for tuberculous patients, and a larger number of physicians 
and field nurses than we now have. 
Teachers’ reports of health conditions indicate a total of 700 cases 
of tuberculosis, 275 cases of blindness, and 300 cripples in the Terri- 
tory. Examinations made of 4,836 individuals by Dr. Emil Krulish 
indicate more than 1,200 cases of tuberculosis, more than 2,000 cases 
of trachoma and other eye diseases, and 600 cases of syphilis. A 
more careful examination made by Dr. Krulish of 2,494 individuals 
out of an estimated population of about 5,500 in the southeastern 
district indicates a total of approximately 500 cases of eye trouble 
and 325 cases of tuberculosis in that district. 
We must consent to let the people suffer and die without help, not 
only those now suffering from disease, but also those to whom these 
diseases will be transferred under present conditions, both natives 
and white settlers, or we must provide physicians, nurses, hospitals,
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, Lit 
and sanitariums necessary to meet the conditions, care for the sick, 
and protect the well. 
For many reasons, Haines, at the mouth of the Chilkat River or a 
point farther up the river, is especially suited for a sanitarium for the 
care and cure of tuberculous patients. The temperature is compara- 
tively mild; the atmosphere is dry. Twenty miles above Haines the 
annual rainfall is only 18 inches, and the lowest temperature on 
record is 28° below zero. The percentage of clear days is large. The 
mountains protect from severe winds. 
As soon as possible we should have 10 small hospitals, probably at 
the following places: Juneau, Klawock, Seldovia, Kanakanak, Kus- 
kokwim River, Nome, Kotzebue, Point Barrow, Tanana, and Nulato; 
and two sanitariums, one on the Chilkat River and one somewhere 
on the western coast, probably in the neighborhood of Norton Sound. 
All hospitals should, of course, be built at places where large settle- 
ments can be built up. The presence of a hospital at one of these 
places will be an additional inducement to the natives to move in 
from their smaller and more remote settlements. As hospitals are 
established the number of field physicians and nurses may be de- 
creased. Natives should, under the policy already outlined, be able 
to pay more and more of their own medical bills as the years go by. 
A generous policy now means good economy and a smaller total of 
expenditures in the end. 
RernpEeer.—Reindeer were first introduced into Alaska in 1892. 
From that time until 1902, when importations ceased, 1,280 reindeer 
were brought in. When the importations began, the 12,000 Eskimos 
of the western and northwestern coast had no means of support other . 
than the precarious means of hunting and fishing, and their life was 
the uncertain wandering life of the hunter and fisher. There was 
nothing in which they could accumulate wealth and no way in which 
they could provide against want, should hunting and fishing fail for a 
season. 
The total appropriations for the purchase, care, and distribution of 
reindeer and the training of herders, to June 30, 1913, was $297,000. 
At the close of this fiscal year there were in Alaska (in 62 herds) 
47,266 reindeer. Of these the Government owned 3,853 distributed 
among 34 of the 62 herds; 797 natives owned 30,532; Laplanders, 
brought over in the beginning to teach the natives to herd and care 
for reindeer, owned 7,834; missions owned 5,047. At $25 per head 
the value of the Government reindeer was $96,325; of the reindeer 
owned by natives, $763,300. The total value of all the reindeer in 
Alaska was $1,181,650... The total income from reindeer to that date 
was $281,271. The total of the income and the value of reindeer to 
June 30, 1913, was $1,462,921, a profit of 392 per cent on the invest- 
ment. The increase in reindeer in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1913,  
-P-A-G-E-54
Liv EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
was 8,790, valued at $219,750. The income from the use of rein- 
deer and from deer slaughtered within the year was $81,111, which, 
added to the increase in value, makes a total of $300,861 for the year, 
or $3,861 more than the total of all the appropriations made for rein- 
deer by the Government from the beginning to that date. 
These figures seem to indicate that this business has been well man- 
aged and not unprofitable. To the money value must be added the 
fact that these Eskimos have through this means been advanced more 
in civilization in two decades than they otherwise could have been in 
a century. They now have a sure and increasing means of support. 
At the end of the present fiscal year there will be in this part of Alaska 
an average of five deer, worth $125, for each native inhabitant. 
The only cost of the deer is that of their intelligent and watchful 
care. There is no cost for feed. The tundras on which reindeer 
moss is found are capable of supporting approximately 5,000,000 deer. 
When this number has been reached they may be slaughtered at the 
rate of a million a year without decreasing their number. Twenty- 
five million dollars worth of reindeer meat a year will not be an incon- 
siderable item in supplying the future population and for export to 
the States. 
Although there has been rapid inerease in the number and value of 
reindeer within the last few years, their distribution has not yet been 
carried to the extent it should. The large herds should be broken 
up and the Government reindeer made into new herds, some of them 
in places quite distant from their present location. 
The policy here outlined will cost only a little more now and much 
. less in the end than the continuation of our present policy, and it will, 
I believe, more surely and more quickly result in the eradication of 
unnecessary diseases and in the attainment of such a degree of indus- 
trial efficiency as will make these people not only self-supporting but 
an important factor in the development of this territory.

tion—Education for citizenship—Moral training—The unevenness of progress. Organizing for 
efficiency. 
The significant element in educational progress to-day is the 
new spirit of social democracy in education: That all children—not 
that assumed psychological average known as the child, but all 
children—are entitled to an equal educational opportunity; the 
privilege of developing in accordance with inborn aptitudes and the 
welfare of a society based on serving and being served. It is this 
idea that gives vitality to the general demand for ‘‘productional 
education,” whether that demand be expressed in the work school of 
Kerschensteiner; in the houses of childhood of Montessori; in the 
gardening work of the farm-life schools in various parts of the United 
States; in the basketry and lace making taught by American teach- 
ers in the Philippines; or in the vocational movement itself, which 
ought to have for its larger aim the broadening of State-provided 
educational opportunities to meet the needs, not of this or that 
special group, but of every individual as an individual and of society as 
a whole. 
THE VOCATIONALIZING OF EDUCATION. 
Viewed in relation to the readjustment and reorganization that 
are taking place, the vocationalizing of education remains the domi- 
nant note of the year. It will probably continue to be of paramount 
importance for many years, since the vocational movement in its 
larger aspects bears such vital relation to the whole problem of 
widening democracy. 
The vocational movement in the United States has been character- 
ized by considerable confusion of terms, and during the past year the 
leaders have sought to differentiate sharply between what may be 
called vocational education and education for life; between real voca- 
tional training and a number of admirable innovations that are fre- 
quently referred to as vocational. 
17726°—xp 1913—vor 1——1 1 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
There are in reality two distinct movements, of different origin, 
that tend to fuse at certain points. One is the movement for definite 
vocational training; specifically, the attempt to do for the industries, 
agriculture, and home making—the more directly productional occu- 
pations, in other words—what is already done more or less for the 
professions. The other is to relate education to life by using every- 
day human activities as a basis of instruction instead of books. One 
might be described as education for work; the other as education by 
work. 
Vocational education, as defined by the Massachusetts commis- 
sioner of education, and written into the laws of several States, is 
“any education whose controlling purpose is to fit for a recognized 
occupation.”” Law schools, medical schools, engineering schools, 
normal schools, furnish vocational training for certain recognized 
professions. Schools for printers, agricultural schools, schools for 
textile weavers, are vocational schools if they have for their control- 
ling purpose the training of persons who expect to make these occu- 
pations their business. Home making is a recognized occupation in 
this sense, regardless of how it may be viewed by the census, and 
schools that train girls actually to do household work, either as mis- 
tresses of homes or in domestic service, are strictly vocational schools. 
The demand for the closer adaptation of education to life has de- 
veloped quite independently of the vocational movement itself. It 
has made itself felt both in the city elementary school and in the one- 
teacher school in the open country. In schools like the experimental 
rural school at Winthrop College, South Carolina, for instance, the 
object is to build education from the very beginning on the activities 
of a farming community. Education is centered on the children’s 
garden, and much training is given in agriculture, but the object is 
not so much to train scientific farmers and home makers as to reach 
the children by means of the things they know of and are interested 
in, with the hope that ultimately those of them who can will choose 
to remain in the country as producers on the land. An institution 
such as Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute combines elements 
of both types of education: The practical training is made the basis 
for academic work, and to that extent it is ‘‘education for life” 
rather than vocational training; at the same time the school makes 
a business of training teachers for service in negro schools as well as 
farmers; in the latter functions it is purely vocational. 
The education-for-life movement is in part a scientific movement, 
derived from the psychological laboratory; in part a simple reaction 
from the academic to the practical, from the abstract to the concrete; 
in part it is also a social-welfare movement, gaining much force from 
settlement experience and the back-to-the-country call; only indi- 
rectly is it an economic movement. Industrial training, on the
-P-A-G-E-57
  INTRODUCTORY SURVEY. 3 
other hand—vocational training for the trades and industries—is in 
the last analysis an economic movement. It was the manufacturers 
who first saw, in their own factories, the need for better-trained work- 
ers. They have realized for some years that it was neither provident 
nor possible to depend always upon the bountiful natural resources 
of the United States to offset lower-paid, but high-skilled, labor in 
other countries. They note Germany’s successes in the world’s 
markets, even in products where machinery has largely displaced 
individual craftsmanship, and they ask that the public schools pro- 
vide training that shall furnish a constant fresh supply of workers 
for the trades and industries, instead of leaving this training entirely 
to chance. As an indication of the sincerity with which this plea is 
made, it is worth noting that many manufacturers have, at their 
own expense, introduced the type of training they know to be needed, 
and many competent observers consider the so-called corporation 
schools the best examples so far of real vocational training in the 
United States. 
A speaker at a recent educational meeting’ described the two 
types of education under the terms ‘‘way-in’’ and ‘‘way-out’’ edu- 
cation: 
Ifa State seriously proposes to do something definite for its youthful citizenship and 
for its industries by.a comprehensive plan under some sort of a compulsory law, State 
wide in its application, I respectfully suggest that it develop two great divisions of the 
educative process; one which I will call the ‘‘way-in” education—an education prac- 
tically common to all pupils; one dealing in the elements of citizenship; studies of 
language, history, geography; a training in the rudiments of arithmetic and elementary 
science; an appreciation of nature, music, and the decorative arts; a training of hand 
skill with its correlative development of mentality; this education to be given to 
pupils before they leave school at the age of 16, by the combined efforts of the home, 
the environment, and the schoolhouse. 
The other phase of education I would call the ‘‘way-out” education. It is specifically 
adapted to individual needs; vocational in a narrow sense, social in its broadest inter- 
pretation; given informally as well as formally through every social, educational, and 
civie agency whose good works in any way can contribute to that educative process 
which will make people, after they have gone to work, more contented, more efficient, 
more open-minded, and better citizens of an industrial democracy. 
The two movements, each with its different history and develop- 
ment, seem to have come to a head in the United States at about the 
same time. Several of the States are endeavoring in their State plans 
to meet both demands. This is notably the case with Wisconsin and 
Indiana. Other States, like Massachusetts and New Jersey, are 
emphasizing for the present the directly vocational aim, without 
giving much attention to the prevocational and practical needs of 
the upper grades of the present elementary school, or the more gen-

eral adaptation of elementary school work to the conerete things of 
life. 
The effect of both movements, taken in conjunction with revised 
psychological ideas of child life, has been to call in question the 
whole accepted curriculum of the school. From a point of agreement 
on a settled group of subjects as the ‘fundamentals,’ many edu- 
cators have come to a point where they accept no subject as of proved 
value; where they are certain of only one thing, that subjects as 
taught in most schools have little to do with real life; and that, 
whether the problem is to teach the same subjects differently or to 
start all over again with a new basis of operation, the present plan 
needs changing. Thus Prof. G. H. Meade declares: 
Our schools are still in one respect medieval. They assume more or less consciously 
that they are called upon to indoctrinate their pupils, and that the doctrine which 
they have to instill—whether it be that of language, number, history, literature, or 
elementary science—is guaranteed as subject matter for instruction by its own truth, 
its traditional position in the school curriculum, and finally by its relation to the rest 
of the ideas, points of view, artistic products, historic monuments, which together 
make up what we call our culture. * * * It follows, then, that when the results 
of the training are disappointing, the pedagogue feels that he is secure within his insti- 
tution and can calmly pass the charge of inefficient training on to other social agents 
and conditions. * * * 
The medieval character of the school is shown in the separation of the institution, 
which has the doctrines of education intrusted to it, from the other training processes, 
in which the intellectual content is at a minimum and the practical facility is at a 
maximum. Ina real sense the doctrine which the school inculcates should be continu- 
ally tried out in the social experience of the child; there should be a play back and 
forth between formal training and the child’s actual conduct. 
For the present the ‘‘education for life” movement is directed 
mainly at the first six grades of the school system, whereas the voca- 
tional preparation itself is proposed for the seventh year and above. 
Events of the next few years may modify these lines of demarcation 
materially. The vocational guidance leaders, the social workers, 
the antichild-labor advocates, and most of those who have the best 
facilities for seeing the stream of young life as it goes from the tene- 
ment and the city street to the factory and the store are exerting 
pressure upon public opinion to raise the age limit of compulsory 
attendance to 16 years and beyond. Whatever action society takes 
in this matter will inevitably affect the point at which vocational 
education of the productional sort shall begin. In any event the 
demand is becoming more and more insistent that in the American 
democracy, a commonwealth where, in theory at least, to be a pro- 
ducer forms the first claim to citizenship, productional training shall 
be given to all children in the light of their aptitudes and needs 
and in the light of the requirements of society; and that such ‘‘con- 
sumptional”” knowledge as may be taught shall furnish not only 
information that will cultivate the mind and make life more pleas-

urable, but shall be an efficient ally of production by inculcating 
economic consumption of those goods which the toil of humanity 
has produced. 
EXTERNAL CHANGE. 
The enlarged purpose of public education and the increasing 
emphasis on the vocational aim are making important changes in 
the external arrangement of education in the United States, signifi- 
cant indications of which are afforded by the year under review. 
The division into elementary, secondary, and higher education has 
lost much of its traditional meaning; and the successful effort of 
institutions in each of the accepted groups to raise standards only 
accentuates the modifications that are going on. Few publications 
merit so well the term ‘‘epoch-making”’ as the report of the National 
Education Association Committee on Economy of Time in Educa- 
tion, published during the year.t_ The conclusion of this committee, 
that at least two years can be saved in the time now given to ele- 
mentary instruction, is significant, not because educators did not 
know it before, but because, coming from a conservative source, it 
represents the mature judgment of those actually engaged in teaching; 
a judgment, furthermore, reached only after the most painstaking 
consideration of all the circumstances, and confirmed by independent 
observers of conditions in other countries. 
For years American practice has been peculiar in its insistence 
upon a nondifferentiated elementary school, usually of eight, but 
sometimes of seven or nine years. Foreign observers have repeat- 
edly called attention to the weakness of this arrangement, particu- 
larly because of its unfortunate postponement of maturer work. 
The change in educational opinion against the prevailing type has been 
brought about by a number of causes: Realization of the heavy loss 
of pupils from the sixth grade on; the imperative demand for voca- 
tional training to be given before the school loses control of the 
pupils who are most in need of it; the raised standards of higher 
education and professional training, together with unflattering com- 
parisons of the product of the elementary schools in the United 
States with children of the same age in other countries, especially 
Germany and England. All of these have tended to concentrate 
attention on the ‘‘lost two years” in elementary education. 
On this point public opinion is by no means as fully developed as the 
opinion of schoolmen. There is a tendency on the part of the com- 
munity to cling to an arrangement that has little to commend it save 
itsage. For this reason the changed structure of elementary and sec- 
ondary education has frequently been accomplished without much ap-

  6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
parent alteration in the external arrangement. There are a num- 
ber of devices for introducing secondary methods and differentiated 
courses in the seventh and eighth grades, which in effect lower the 
high-school line without making any too revolutionary change in 
existing institutions. This is, of course, only a passing phenomenon. 
The most direct plan, and the one most popular, appears to be the jun- 
ior high school, consisting of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, 
followed by the three upper high-school years as a separate institu- 
tion. States like New Jersey and Michigan, for instance, with a legal 
school establishment of 12 grades, the high school being officially 
merely a segregation of the upper grades of the scheme, find them- 
selves in a much better position to accomplish external reorganiza- 
tion. Whatever method is adopted, the best educational sentiment 
of the country is now behind a plan to save at least two of the pres- 
ent eight years devoted to elementary schooling; and the coming 
year will see many additions to the list of communities where second- 
ary or differentiated work is taken up at the age of 12 or 13 instead 
of 14 and 15. 
This problem is intimately connected with that of the articulation 
of school and college. No public high school dares to take away 
from its pupils the opportunity of college preparation, regardless of 
how few expect to go on to college work. Experience shows that 
the door of opportunity is apt to remain closed to a large number of 
pupils when the college is in a position to dictate to the high school 
what subjects shall be presented for entrance, especially if the col- 
lege is a private or only quasi public institution not responsive to 
popular demands. Many high schools, particularly those that have 
for years maintained a reputation for college preparatory work and 
guard that reputation jealously, hesitate to introduce the so-called 
vocational subjects or adapt their work more closely to the needs of 
the community, because the colleges to which their students aspire 
do not recognize such subjects for entrance. With the extension of 
State-supported education to include college and university, and 
with many endowed institutions assuming or claiming a State or 
national function, there is a marked tendency on the part of the col- 
leges to meet the high schools half way and a disposition on the part 
of the schools to make the standard of vocational work high enough 
to warrant its acceptance in some part at least as evidence of intel- 
lectual accomplishment by the college. 
At the upper end the problem presents peculiar difficulties, toward 
the solution of which less progress has been made. There is much 
confusion of function, due in part to the alternate developments of 
the English-college and German-university influence in American 
higher education, in part to varying local conditions. On the one 
hand is the inclination of the college and university more and more 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
INTRODUCTORY SURVEY. q 
to leave elementary instruction—in the modern languages, for 
example—to the high schools. On the other hand there is still a 
large group of institutions calling themselves colleges’ that do at 
most two years of what is usually accepted as college work—that is, 
in advance of a four-year high-school course. These colleges teach 
the elements of a variety of subjects. Without the equipment for 
scientific research, they may frequently be centers of real inspira- 
tion and culture, highly valuable to the community. What is to be 
their future? Sometimes they revert to the secondary school type; 
there are current instances of this, but it is not a popular move. 
Some observers profess to believe that the “college” is emerging—a 
distinct middle type between the high school and the university. 
Others believe that the number of colleges, like the number of pro- 
fessional schools, is destined to decrease materially, and that many 
of the institutions now calling themselves colleges will become special 
schools with definite vocational aims—a far more important, if less 
pretentious, function. The difficulty of achieving this kind of a 
change is obvious. The academic inertia complained of by the 
leaders in vocational education is often most noticeable in an insti- 
tution of this type, and the change contemplated is almost too much 
of a right-about-face to be expected. The fact that many of these 
institutions are denominational in endowment, if not in aim, com- 
plicates the problem. Yet there are already some illustrious exam- 
ples, in the South particularly, of what the old-line college can do by 
meeting the vocational needs of the community.   
HEALTH SUPERVISION. 
Rapid progress has been made during the past year in health 
supervision and health teaching in the public schools. Medical 
inspection, school nurse service, open-air schools, special classes for 
exceptional children—these have come to be recognized necessities 
in any public-school system, and the problem is no longer one of 
introduction, but of extension and organization. Few cities suffi- 
ciently organized to have a superintendent of schools are without 
the beginnings of a school health system. Free eyeglasses, free 
dental treatment, and the penny lunch are not quite so generally 
recognized, but a number of cities are introducing them into their 
schools. 
The step from city to county or State has been made only in a 
few instances so far; it is the next step in progress. By combining 
to secure the services of & health officer, counties in some parts of 
the country are introducing medical inspection and the usual follow- 
up work that have already become effective in the cities. Several 
States now have plans in operation for State-wide health supervision 
of school children.

                    EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
To a larger extent than heretofore the health movement appears 
to be working itself out through public educational agencies. With 
the recognition of the supreme importance of conservation of health 
and prevention of disease as compared with treatment has come also 
the realization that conservation and prevention can best be brought 
about by the early inculcation of proper habits of hygiene and sani- 
tation in childhood. It is felt that public health is not only pur- 
chasable, but purchasable most economically in the public school. 
A continued raising of the standards of medical education, evi- 
denced by fewer but better medical schools; special preparation of 
teachers and leaders for public-health work, exemplified in the 
“school for health officers” of Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
and Harvard University and the introduction of the degree of doctor 
of public health in a number of American universities; large endow- 
ments for medical education, particularly in the field of research 
leading to prevention, as in the two notable benefactions of the year, 
those for Cornell and Johns Hopkins; marked activity on the part of 
State health authorities in utilizing educational agencies for the dis- 
semination of health information—these are some of the indications 
of progress in health teaching for the year. 
The health-conservation principle is emphasized still further in the 
play movement, which continues to develop vigorously. Larger school 
grounds in city and country, better evening recreational opportu- 
ties in school social centers, and supervised athletics for all children 
under wholesome conditions are a few of the important developments 
that show the increased influence of the play movement as a positive 
force in the advancement of public health. 
RURAL     EDUCATION. 
The problem of rural education is a special problem, not because it 
ought to be, but because of differing development in city and country, 
and society’s failure to provide equally. As a special problem, rural 
education is affected with particular force by most of the foregoing 
considerations. States with large rural population are seeking not 
only to make elementary education in the country more closely 
related to rural life, but also to provide vocational training in agri- 
culture through rural high schools and elaborate extension systems, 
as well as in the existing agricultural colleges themselves. In one 
sense the fact that education in rural districts has remained back- 
ward is an advantage rather than a detriment for the present problem; 
there is no expensive machinery of education to be adjusted; there 
are fewer old-line schoolmen to be won over; there is somewhat less 
prejudice to be combated. In short, the country has an unsurpassed 
opportunity to build up an education that shall really provide a 
basis for a finer civilization; an education that may be intimately

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY. 9 
connected with rural life and at the same time generous in its pro- 
vision for vocational training. 
Giving equal opportunities to the rural school is coming more and 
more to be considered an essential factor in educational reorganiza- 
tion. American complacency with regard to rural conditions has 
had many rude jolts during the past year or so, and is due for many 
more until the realization becomes general that lack of civilizing 
opportunities in the country districts means fewer people in the 
country, and fewer people in the country means higher and ever 
higher cost of living. The sequence is as inevitable as the duty is 
plain—State-provided education, with equal opportunities for every 
citizen of the State in city, village, or country. 
The special lines of activity in the rural-school movement during 
the year have been: Further consolidation and centralization of 
schools in country districts; particular attention to the possibilities 
of the one-teacher school so that it may render maximum service 
wherever consolidation is impracticable; special preparation of teach- 
ers for rural-school work; extension of adequate supervision of rural 
schools under the county-unit plan; concentration of effort for rural 
betterment in local improvement associations, leagues, and similar 
organizations working through and with the school; definite State- 
wide provisions for lengthening the school term, paying better sala- 
ries, and in other ways increasing the importance of the teacher’s 
position in the community. 
EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP. 
“By far the greatest emphasis is given by our correspondents to 
moral training and preparation for citizenship,” says the report on 
Economy of Time in Education, already referred to. The call for 
training in citizenship and morals represents another aspect of the 
education-for-life movement; it represents a demand for definite 
training in character that is felt to be lacking in the public school. 
Education for citizenship is by no means a new demand, but it has 
acquired new force and new meaning recently. The original motive 
for establishing common schools was to produce good and useful citi- 
zens; and it is likewise true that all schools train for citizenship of 
some sort—good, bad, or indifferent. The present call is for a more 
practical and definite responsibility on the part of the school that 
its product shall be fitted for the exercise of citizenship in a country 
whose only defense is the civic intelligence of its citizens; that there 
shall be a better defined relation between instruction in the school 
and the business of actual citizenship in the larger world outside. 
Direct training in citizenship as at present proposed and experi- 
mented with differs from the old course in civics in much the same 
way that the present-day conception of citizenship compares with
-P-A-G-E-64
  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the older idea of a citizen’s part in the community. Where the older 
civics taught mainly the bare machinery of government, the new 
citizenship training involves the ever-widening field of civic responsi- 
bility and interest corresponding to the aroused social conscience of 
to-day. Something of the spirit behind the current demand may be 
seen from the preliminary report of the commission on reorganization 
of secondary education of the National Education Association. 
According to the writer of the section on ‘‘Social studies,” good 
citizenship is the end sought: 
Good citizenship should be the aim of social studies in the high school. While the 
administration and instruction throughout the school should contribute to the social 
welfare of the community, it is maintained that social studies have direct responsi- 
bility in this field. Facts, conditions, theories, and activities that do not contribute 
rather directly to the appreciation of methods of human betterment have no claim. 
Under this test the old civics, almost exclusively a study of government machinery, 
must give way to the new civics, a study of all manner of social efforts to improve 
mankind. It is not so important that the pupil know how the President is elected 
as that he shall understand the duties of the health officer in his community. The 
time formerly spent in the effort to understand the process of passing a law over the 
President’s veto is now to be more profitably used in the observation of the voca- 
tional resources of the community, 
In line with this emphasis the committee recommends that social 
studies in the high school shall include such topics as: 
Community health, housing and homes, pure food, public recreation, good roads, 
parcel post and postal savings, community education, poverty and the care of the 
poor, crime and reform, family income, savings banks and life insurance, human 
rights versus property rights, impulsive action of mobs, the selfish conservation of 
tradition, and public utilities. 
There is general agreement that the school’s plan for teaching 
citizenship shall include some form of student experimentation in 
government, to accord with the practical spirit that is behind the 
demand. This experimentation may take the form of the school 
republic,! as worked out some years ago in this country and more 
recently introduced into Alaska and among dependent peoples; or 
it may be in line with the practice school course in civics, where the 
pupils are led carefully, beginning in the fifth grade, by contact with 
the visible features of community government, through the com- 
moner functions of organized community welfare to the main func- 
tions of larger units of society, without any self-government idea 
being necessarily involved.? In any case, the demand for citizenship 
instruction will mean the substitution of social science, or history 
taught from the social viewpoint, for the traditional history of the 
schools.

INTRODUCTORY SURVEY. il 
It is not expected that school citizenship training will turn out 
“experts.” No one cares to have it do that. What it will do is to 
turn out boys and girls with a basis for further civic knowledge. 
Armed with the essentials of the civic sciences they will be ready to 
assimilate more information; they will have a foundation for intelli- 
gent consideration of public questions; they will grow up to be 
better citizens. 
It seems probable that education for citizenship will be one of the 
conspicuous features of the continuation school system, in whatever 
form this may be established in the United States. The experience 
of Germany shows that citizenship training acquires special force 
when given in conjunction with some sort of vocational training, or 
to students who are more mature than the average children in the 
schools. Modern training for citizenship tends to relate the worker 
and his work to the activities of society as a whole, and in so doing 
demonstrates the essential worthiness of any service, whether of hand 
or head, that contributes to society’s fundamental necessities. Good 
citizenship involves a knowledge and appreciation of the peculiar 
value of each individual contribution to the doing of the world’s 
tasks, and training to make this knowledge mutual is one of the real 
needs of democracy. 
There is a larger aspect to the demand for education in citizenship 
that can not be answered by the introduction of this or that course. 
The teaching of good citizenship presupposes teachers who are them- 
selves notable examples of good citizenship. The technique of citi- 
zenship may be imparted readily enough, but the spirit of good 
citizenship can only be taught by men or women who are themselves 
markedly proficient in the knowledge of civic and social obligation. 
As long as teaching in this country is as far from being a profession 
as it is to-day, the kind of teachers who are most needed can not be 
secured. The rural school teacher whose one ambition is to “ad- 
vance”’ to a city job as quickly as possible is hardly the one to inspire 
her country pupils with the significance of rural civilization. The 
underpaid man teacher in the city, no matter how well-intentioned 
he may be, is not likely to prove an inspiring guide for future citizens 
in those virtues which are primarily the insignia of worthy citizen- 
ship. It is well to say, of course, that competent men and women 
will go into the occupation of teaching regardless of the money 
involved; but the economic demand is a primal one, and men can not 
and should not make a sacrifice that is not merely personal, but 
social; for the teacher who can not afford to marry, or, if married, 
can not afford to have children, is not the ideal exponent of citizen- 
ship. When the public once recognizes in practice as it does in 
theory the function of the school in preparing for citizenship, it will 
be more considerate of those whom it calls upon to prepare its children 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
for this highly delicate duty. It will see to it that teaching is made 
a profession, demanding adequate training and receiving commen- 
surate reward; not a refuge for those who have nothing else in sight; 
it will provide that this profession, while by no means a money- 
making one, shall be one in which enough is paid to make the teacher 
independent of the petty worries that unfit him for the most im- 
portant phases of his work. 
  MORAL TRAINING. 
Just as a demand for citizenship training assumes a lack of connec- 
tion between the school and the larger duties of life, so the demand 
for “moral training,” in the sense of instruction in morals, takes for 
granted that the public school fails at the important point of relating 
its instruction to the problem of moral character. The traditional 
separation of church and state in the United States gives a certain 
superficial validity to the claim that the school makes no attempt to 
influence the morals of its pupils; and the existence of a vast machin- 
ery of denominational elementary, secondary, and higher education 
assuredly indicates that a considerable element in the population 
protests against education without explicit moral or religious founda- 
tion. The demand for a closer relation between the work of the 
school and the moral quality of its product is therefore voiced by 
many educators, some of whom believe that this relation can be 
produced by specific training in morals. 
The whole question of deliberate training in morals is much 
debated. It can only be recorded for the purposes of this survey 
that current opinion seems to incline to the belief that, while the 
traditional separation of church and state in education has been 
entirely wise in the circumstances, it is possible that the pendulum 
has swung a little too far the other way in the United States; that 
anxiety to leave religion out of the schools may have also tended to 
exclude important moral influences from the schools. Thus, one 
writer notes that— 
the condition of public education in many places forbids the use of pictures which 
have been found by experience to be most uplifting. The only religion which the 
school officially teaches by its books, its pictures, and its statues, is that of Greece 
and Rome. 
Just what the school can do, more than it now does, to give direct 
instruction in morals is by no means a matter of agreement. One 
group, represented by the National Institute for Moral Instruction, 
Baltimore, Md., lays stress upon the so-called ‘visual method,” 
whereby school children are shown stereopticon illustrations of real 
problems in boy and girl life. The lecturer interprets the pictures 
and discusses the problems presented. In this plan the teachers are   
1 Sneath and Hodges: “Moral training in school and home.’””
-P-A-G-E-67
  INTRODUCTORY SURVEY. 13 
expected to follow up the formal lecture to see that the “visual 
instruction” makes a real impression in conduct. 
Others depend upon textbooks. One such book, compiled for State 
use, differs from others by beginning frankly with business success or 
failure, and working from this to larger ideals of life and service.t 
In this book the plan of thought-provoking questions is carried out 
effectively. A section of the book contains material upon which the 
answers may be evolved, but plenty of opportunity is presented for 
individual initiative, both on the part of teacher and pupil. The 
theory of the book is that the boy or girl will have the questions 
discussed at home, with playmates, as well as in the schoolroom. 
Organized moral sentiment is thus developed about concrete prob- 
lems concerning what to do and what not to do. 
Several of the writers of the year are insisting that the instruction 
belongs chiefly in the home; and in any event, whether given at home 
or in school, that it must be chiefly indirect: 
‘We must avoid the formal, didactic method. We should introduce children to the 
virtues and vices, with their corresponding rewards and punishments, through fairy 
tale, myth, fable, allegory, parable, legend, stories of heroes and heroines, biography, 
and history. The child is easily brought into sympathy with the story, and grasps 
in this concrete and interesting way its moral import; and the lesson, because of the 
child’s intense sympathies, soon sinks into his sensitive mind and receptive heart.” 
This point is also emphasized by Prof. Dewey, who, in explaining 
why his study of the question considers moral principles in education, 
rather than education in mgrals, says: 
The distinction between “moral ideas” and “ideas about morality” explains for us 
a source of continual misunderstanding between teachers in the schools and critics of 
education outside of the schools. The latter look through the school programs and the 
school courses of study, and do not find any place set apart for instruction in ethics or 
for “moral teaching.”” Then they assert that the schools are doing nothing, or next 
to nothing, for character training; they become emphatic, even vehement, about the 
moral deficiences of public education. The school teachers, on the other hand, resent 
these criticisms as an injustice, and hold not only that they do ‘teach morals,” but 
that they teach them every moment of the day, five days in a week. 
In this contention the teachers are in principle in the right. If they are in the wrong, 
it is not because special methods are not set aside for what after all can only be teaching 
about morals, but because their own characters, or their school atmosphere and ideals, 
or their methods of teaching, or the subject matter which they teach, are not such in 
detail as to bring intellectual results into vital union with character, so that they become 
working forces in behavior. Without discussing, therefore, the limits or the value 
of so-called moral instruction (or better, instruction about morals) it may be laid down 
as fundamental that the influence of direct moral instruction even at its very best 
is comparatively small in amount and slight in influence, when the whole field of 
moral growth through education is taken into account.?

Here again, as with the problem of training for better citizenship, 
the school is face to face with the task of getting teachers who shall 
themselves exemplify the moral fiber that the schools are asked 
to bestow. After all, the most influential moral fact about the school 
is the presence of the teacher: 
The most valuable contribution which a good school can make to the equipment of 
a growing citizen is a point of view, a way of looking at things, a sense of values. And 
this, for good or ill, the teacher gives. It all depends upon the teacher’s personality 
* * %, What is taught is learned, or not, according as these virtues prevail in the 
teacher’s life. The most important part in the moralizing of the school is the moraliz- 
ing of the teacher. 
The demand for moral training acquires special force in view of the 
present widespread agitation of the sex-hygiene question. Those 
opposed to the introduction of sex hygiene in the public schools 
usually take the stand that what is needed is not information about 
the hygiene of sex or the dangers of venereal disease, but positive 
instruction in character and right living. Even those who favor sex 
instruction in the schools appreciate the importance of any moral 
training the school can give. Anything that will result in strength- 
ened will power, in higher moral sense, or in any reenforcement of the 
power to discriminate in ethical values, is so much progress toward 
combating the abuse of the sex instinct. On the other hand, there is 
clearly some claim for sex instruction itself as of positive moral value, 
if properly given. The truth, told frankly and sympathetically by 
mother to child, ought to result in the kind of understanding that 
makes for character. Whether the same would be true of sex 
instruction in school is more of a question. 
THE UNEVENNESS OF PROGRESS. 
  In any survey of current educational conditions in the United 
States the most striking and in some respects the most alarming 
feature is the lack of uniformity in educational progress. Some sec- 
tions are just emerging from illiteracy, while others are providing 
their citizens with every possible educational advantage, from kin- 
dergarten to university. Within a few miles of the borders of a city 
with a magnificent school system, with palatial buildings, with 
trained teachers and supervisors, with elaborate library and tech- 
nical equipment, with careful health supervision of its children, in 
short, with every conceivable educational opportunity, may be found 
the educational facilities of a backwoods civilization. For the most 
part there is no such thing as a State standard of education, not to 
speak of a national standard. 
Again, it is American custom to think in terms of conspicuous 
achievements; to boast the gilded tip of the pyramid and forget the 
base of inferior metal. In many of the things that may be counted
-P-A-G-E-69
    
INTRODUCTORY SURVEY. 15 
as progress, American communities have but made a beginning. The 
danger is not in overvaluing the beginning, but in assuming that 
isolated examples of notably successful work atone for the large 
measure of omission. Few communities even approximate what 
educators are agreed to consider the fair demands of modern educa- 
tion. The conclusion of Prof. Hanus with regard to New York City, 
that in a number of important fields of education it offers little or 
nothing at all, is not to be construed as a special reflection on New 
York. It is merely a way of saying that most American cities, 
including the greatest of them, are still far behind what educational 
theorists have long thought should be done. ‘ 
A still more disheartening fact is that this unevenness of progress 
is true, not merely of the newer things in education, but of the 
actual physical facilities for schooling of any kind. There are still 
whole States and divisions of States where the recognized protective 
principle of compulsory education is not yet in effect and where the 
struggle is not over the desirability of introducing this or that im- 
provement, this or that health measure, this or that cultural or 
vocational opportunity, but where the whole duty of the State to 
teach its citizens how to read and write is the point fought for and 
not yet won. Of the thousand or more school laws passed last year, 
hardly more than one or two had any appreciable effect on this 
simple problem of getting the State’s children into school. Similarly 
with regard to length of term. The vigorous campaign has, to be 
sure, resulted in lengthening of the school term, but the school of a 
few months’ duration is still the prevailing rural type in too many 
States. 
ORGANIZING FOR EFFICIENCY. 
At the same time, the present year has seen increased activity on 
the part of National and State fact-producing agencies engaged in 
furthering educational progress, and much of this activity has 
resulted in strengthened opinion in respect to the obligation for 
State-provided education. Again, national agencies for betterment, 
both private and governmental, have seen their efforts supported 
splendidly by efficient local organizations of citizens. The school 
improvement leagues, the parent-teacher associations, the county 
improvement associations, and other local agencies supplementary to 
the school have proved to be a peculiarly valuable factor in arousing 
public opinion. 
Not only inspiration is needed, but fact. There is urgent need for 
the fact basis in education to-day. It is futile to urge the extension 
of vocational training or vocational guidance until the fundamental 
facts about occupations are at hand. The social survey, the health 
survey, the educational inquiry—these should be the regular pro- 
, 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
cedure, not the isolated instance, in American communities, whether 
city or country. The kind of survey of vocational opportunities, for 
example, that the Women’s Municipal League of Boston made for 
that city should be made for every city and every country commu- 
nity. Every agency should be utilized that will first find out the 
needs of the community, compare them with the opportunities at 
hand, and then make both needs and opportunities so persistently 
heard that the public will be compelled to give heed. The survey 
itself is not only a way of finding out educational conditions; it is 
one of the best devices for concentrating public attention on educa- 
tion. No one expects New York to change its school system in 
toto to conform to the plans laid down by the members of the Hanus 
inquiry, but the product of that inquiry, in the form of expert edu- 
cational information, is bound to have a stimulating effect on the 
thoughts of people with regard to schools and their work, not only 
in New York City, but throughout the Nation. The Ohio survey 
recently completed, with the educational congress that attended it, 
not only reveals a State organized to give equal educational oppor- 
tunity to all, but demonstrates that the public only asks for sound 
information with respect to education in order to make a notable 
beginning in providing it. 
To the important general influences affecting current educational 
progress must be added the efficiency movement in all its aspects. 
There is no field of education, public or private, that has not been 
powerfully, though often unconsciously, influenced by it, and apart 
from certain extreme applications, the effect has been thoroughly 
stimulating and wholesome. The efficiency principle, or, as it has 
almost become, the efficiency instinct, has caused educational leaders 
in school, college, and university alike to scrutinize with a new care- 
fulness their expenditures of time, energy, and money; to analyze 
methods, teaching force, and subjects of curriculum with a clearer 
vision of social as-well as economic cost and result; and above all, 
to see the educational problem as a single whole, whose closely re- 
lated parts need to be repeatedly and systematically tested not only 
for themselves, but for the relation they bear to total community 
achievement.

AGENCIES FOR STANDARDIZATION, 
A survey of higher education in the United States for the year 
covered by this Report of the Commissioner of Education shows few 
new movements of great significance; nor does it reveal any especially 
noteworthy new results of combinations of old forces. On the other 
hand even a casual observer must be impressed by the notable 
acceleration of certain movements which have been commented on 
in earlier reports of the Bureau of Education. There are multiplying 
signs of fruitful self-examination on the part of institutions and lead- 
ers, and a willingness to make candid comparison with accepted 
standards, without any sense of compulsion toward a hard and fast 
uniformity. Publicity of facts ascertained by competent and impar- 
tial agencies, whose statements of these facts may sometimes be in 
contrast to the literature issued by officers or paid publicity agents, 
has become quite as much a factor in the betterment of conditions 
in higher education as the same sort of publicity has been in the bet- 
terment of the management and responsibilities of great corporations 
engaged in transportation and manufacturing. 
Neither Federal Government nor State government, with the excep- 
tion of New York, has or is likely soon to have any very large and 
effective control over the large number of independent or denomina- 
tional colleges of the country; but as agents for ascertaining and 
publishing facts regarding institutions appealing to the public for 
financial support and for students, both Governments have important 
functions to perform, In the Western and Southern States the State 
universities are approximately of a common type, both in organiza- 
tion and in the standards toward which they are striving. Their 
achievements are bound to establish for their Commonwealths certain

  18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
measures of equipment, of effective teaching, of social service, and of 
scholarship which will have a powerful reflex influence upon all other 
institutions within their States, quite regardless of questions of author- 
ity or control. 
There is already a steady stream of students flowing from the 
smaller and independent colleges to the State universities, sometimes 
as undergraduates desiring to enter some technical or specialized 
course, in other cases as students who have graduated and who enter 
the graduate school, but more often as students who enter some one 
of the professional schools of the university. All this means that the 
State university must know very exactly, if possible, the character of 
the work done by these migrating students in their several institu- 
tions. The investigations thus necessitated, and their resulting 
knowledge, can not be confidential; record of them becomes in a large 
sense a public record, upon which the authorities of the State univer- 
sity are obliged to act. Such States, therefore, will practically have 
established by indirection if not by intention an authoritative evalua- 
tion of the work of their various institutions. Just as the evalua- 
tion or accrediting of the secondary schools of a State by the State 
university is accepted and recognized in other States and by other 
institutions, so it may reasonably be expected that these results of 
careful, judicious, broadminded, sympathetic evaluation of the work 
of colleges will be accepted and made a basis of action by many insti- 
tutions outside the State immediately concerned. Whatever irrita- 
tion or sharp difference of judgment may now and then arise through 
the unwillingness of a university to accept an institution’s estimate of 
itself and its works, only good can come to the cause of higher educa- 
tion as a whole from such evaluation and presentation of the truth. 
But not all State university officers and committees will have the 
same standards of judgment; not all will find themselves at all 
times in perfect freedom to investigate and to pronounce an opin- 
ion; in some cases prejudice or jealousy or unfair ambition will be 
charged against the State university. The significance of a move- 
ment for coordination of these judgments, which has already been 
inaugurated, deserves particular attention. 
One of the great inter-State or sectional organizations which has 
hitherto concerned itself chiefly with one-half of the work suggested 
by its name has enlarged its efforts in highly suggestive fashion. -The 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools has 
confined its activities in the main to the problems of the secondary 
school and its relations to the college. Though the fourth article of 
the constitution of the association expressly states that, ‘‘All the 
decisions of the association bearing upon the policy and management of 
higher and secondary institutions are understood to be advisory in 
their character,” it has been a very potent factor, through its com- 
mission on accredited schools and its published list of such schools
-P-A-G-E-73

in the 16 States represented in its membership, in elevating the 
standards of secondary education. By the third article of this con- 
stitution, only those universities, colleges, or junior colleges are eligi- 
ble for membership which require for admission 15 units of secondary 
work, and no secondary school is eligible which does not provide these 
15 units. Since 1910 this article has also included this provision: 
“After April 1, 1912, no college or university shall be eligible to mem- 
bership which is not on the list of accredited colleges of the associa- 
tion.” But the making of this list proved to be a matter requiring 
patience, tact, and courage, and it was not until March, 1913, that 
the commission was able to present such a list to the association for 
its adoption. 
The importance of this step can not easily be overestimated, espe- 
cially if it be borne in mind that this is a voluntary association already 
containing a large number of institutions certain to be affected by 
this action. The adoption of the report of the commission fixed cer- 
tain standards for colleges and universities and established a list of 
accredited colleges as prescribed in the constitution of the association. 
This list included 73 institutions; 2 of these are junior colleges, and 7 
are institutions already members of the association, continued as such, 
and placed upon the approved list for one year with an asterisk before 
their names indicating that they conform to the standards set by the 
association except the standard referring to endowment. The dis- 
tribution of the institutions thus listed is as follows: Ohio, 17; Michi- 
gan, 23 Indiana, 4; Illinois, 13; Wisconsin, 6; Minnesota, 3; Iowa, 10; 
Missouri, 5; Nebraska, 2; Kansas, 4; Colorado, 1; Oklahoma, 1; South 
Dakota, 2; North Dakota, 2; Kentucky, 1. Five teachers’ colleges 
and normal schools are placed in an unclassified list for the year 
1913-14. ji 
The main sections of this important report, and the statement of 
the standards in accordance with which the commission proceeded in 
estimating the standing of institutions after receiving the returns 
from a carefully prepared questionnaire, are here presented as they 
were adopted on March 21, 1913: 
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMISSION TO THE ASSOCIATION, PRESENTED 
maRcH 21, 1913. 
The commission recommends that college standard No. 2 be amended. This stand- 
ard now reads as follows: “The college shall require for admission not less than 14 
secondary units as defined by this association.”’ It is recommended that this stand- 
ard be amended by the addition of the statement, ‘‘ After September, 1915, no insti- 
tution shall be approved which admits any conditioned students with less than 14 
units.’” 
The commission reports that the officers were authorized to warn those colleges on 
the approved list whose practices depart in their judgment in any measure from the 
standards. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
    20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The commission reports that the officers were authorized to follow up the informa- 
tion now in hand by inquiring into the records of students who have gone into grad- 
uate and professional study from colleges on the accepted list. 
The commission reports that the cases of normal colleges and normal schools now 
on the membership list of the association were laid on the table for one year; and the 
officers were directed to prepare and present a report at the next annual meeting 
dealing with the matter of an approved list of such institutions. 
The commission reports that two junior colleges were accepted for the approved 
list with the statement added to the names of these institutions that they are junior 
colleges. ; 
The commission reports that the officers were authorized to use the information 
collected on the blanks for the publication of a general report discussing the organiza- 
tion and practice of colleges in this territory. 
The commission reports favorable action on the following resolution: That the col- 
leges now members of the association, which have the approval of the committee in 
every respect except that of endowment, be retained with a siar stating this fact, 
and be allowed one year in which to bring up the endowment deficiency. 
The commission reports that it ordered the normal colleges and normal schools now 
members of the association to be retained on an unclassified list for one year. 
UNAMENDED STANDARDS FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
Standards of Accrediting Colleges and Universities. 
The standard American college is a college with a four-year curriculum with a ten- 
dency to differentiate its parts in such a way that the first two years are a continuation 
of, and a supplement to, the work of secondary instruction as given in the high school, 
while the last two years are shaped more or less distinctly in the direction of special; 
professional, or university instruction. 
The following constitute the standards for accrediting colleges for the present year: 
1. The minimum scholastic requirement of all college teachers shall be equivalent 
to graduation from a college belonging to this association, and graduate work equal at 
least to that required for a master’s degree. Graduate study and training in research 
equivalent to that required for the Ph. D. degree are urgently recommended, but the 
teacher’s success is to be determined by the efficiency of his teaching, as well as by his 
research work. : 
2. The college shall require for admission not less than 14 secondary units, as defined 
by this association. 
3. The college shall require not less than 120 semester hours for graduation. 
4, The college shall be provided with library and laboratory equipment sufficient 
to develop fully and illustrate each course announced. 
5. The college, if a corporate institution, shall possess a productive endowment of 
not less than $200,000. 
6. The college, if a tax-supported institution, shall receive an annual income of not 
Jess than $100,000. 
7. The college. shall maintain at least eight distinct departments in liberal arts, 
each with at least one professor giving full time to the college work in that depart- 
ment. 
8. The location and construction of the buildings, the lighting, heating, and ven- 
tilation of the rooms, the nature of the laboratories, corridors, closets, water supply, 
school furniture, apparatus, and methods of cleaning shall be such as to insure hygienic 
conditions for both students and teachers. 
9. The number of hours of work given by each teacher will vary in the different 
departments. To determine this, the amount of preparation required for the class 
and the time needed for study to keep abreast of the subject, together with the num-
-P-A-G-E-75
    
HIGHER EDUCATION. 21 
ber of students, must be taken into account; but in no case shall more than 18 hours 
per week be required, 15 being recommended ‘as a maximum. 
10. The college must be able to prepare its graduates to enter recognized graduate 
schools as candidates for advanced degrees. 
11. The college should limit the number of students in a recitation or laboratory 
class to 30. 
The character of the curriculum, the efficiency of instruction, the scientific 
spirit, the standard for regular degrees, the conservatism in granting honorary degrees, 
and the tone of the institution shall also be factors in determining eligibility. 
No institution shall be accredited or retained on the accredited list, unless a regular 
blank has been filed with the commission, and is filed triennially, unless the inspec- 
tors have waived the presentation of the triennial blank. 
  STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
One group of notable changes in the field of higher education during 
the year covered by this report relates to institutions supported more 
or less completely by the State and governed by conditions for which 
the States themselves are responsible. Here there has been no slack- 
ening in the steady development of generous support of State educa- 
tional institutions of all kinds—universities, colleges, professional 
schools, technological schools, normal schools, and secondary schools. 
In each of three States the biennial appropriation made by the 
legislature of 1913 for the support of the State universities has passed 
$3,000,000, and in the case of the University of Illinois the appropria- 
tion from the fund created by the mill tax and exclusive of revenue 
from Federal land grants, student fees, etc., reached the astonishing 
total of $4,500,000 for maintenance, improvements, and land pur- 
chases. The total biennial appropriation for the University of 
Wisconsin was $4,130,440; for the University of California approxi- 
mately $3,900,000. In the last two cases the appropriations were 
from current State revenues, and by no means indicate the total 
revenue of the institutions mentioned. 
In the Annual Report for 1912 considerable space was devoted to 
the experiment of a central board for several of the higher educa- 
tional institutions in a given State. The legislative period just closed 
produced new central boards in Kansas and Idaho. Vermont cre- 
ated a commission composed in part of prominent university and 
business men outside the State for the purpose of reporting upon a 
unification of the State-supported institutions and coordination of 
their work with one or more of the private institutions. 
In Oregon further progress has been made in correlation of work 
of the University of Oregon and the Oregon Agricultural College. In 
Towa the plan of the State board of education for defining and delimit- 
ing more clearly than heretofore the functions of the three great 
institutions in its charge aroused vigorous and vehement opposition 
from the alumni and supporters of the institutions; and the legislature 
devoted a good deal of its time to this particular matter. The result  
-P-A-G-E-76
    ‘ 22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
was the abandonment by the board of the proposed rearrangement 
and reorganization of the higher educational work of the State, and a 
practical continuance of the conditions which the board thought to 
improve through its proposals. 
STATE AID FOR INSTITUTIONS UNDER PRIVATE CONTROL. 
In the middie region or twilight zone between institutions which 
are wholly controlled by the State and institutions which are con- 
trolled by private corporations, certain developments should be noted 
which are in the nature of an enlargement of old processes rather than 
the inauguration of new plans of educational organization and sup- 
port. Variations from the strict observation of the principle of 
separating completely state and church are here and there observable: 
(1) Through appropriations for the support of charitable institu- 
tions conducted in the interests of, or in close affiliation with, some 
religious denomination; (2) through appropriations for hospitals and 
medical schools connected with private denominational colleges; 
and (3) through appropriations for special schools in connection with 
institutions not otherwise related to the State or to public education. 
The State of New York has for many years made large appropria- 
tions to the New York State College of Agriculture, which is a college 
of Cornell University. No small part of the prestige and service of 
Cornell University has come to it through this State support, and the 
university is so far recognized as the State University of New York 
that it is accorded membership in the National Association of State 
Universities; but the control of the money appropriations by the 
State to this college is lodged in the hands of the board of trustees of 
Cornell University, a body in which the State has a large, but not a 
dominating representation. In the total membership of 40, the State 
representatives comprise only 30 per cent, made up of the governor 
and six other State officials serving ‘ex officio, and five members 
appointed by the governor. 
In 1913 the Legislature of New York appropriated, aside from the 
interest on the college land-scrip fund ($34,428.80), for the main- 
tenance, equipment, and necessary materials to conduct the ‘‘State 
College of Agriculture at Cornell University,” $450,000, and to the 
State Veterinary College at Cornell University, $65,000. 
Since 1900 New York has also made appropriations annually for 
the New York School of Clay-Working and Ceramics, at Alfred 
University. Its buildings are adjacent to the university campus, and 
its affairs are administered by the trustees of the university. The 
appropriation in 1913 amounted to $16,000. In 1908 the State pro- 
vided further for the establishment of a State School of Agriculture 
at this university, which is governed by a board of managers ap- 
pointed by the trustees of Alfred University, together with the State
-P-A-G-E-77
HIGHER EDUCATION. 23 
  commissioner of agriculture and the director of the State college of 
agriculture. The appropriation for this school in 1913 was $35,000. 
In somewhat similar manner the State made an appropriation of 
$35,000 for the New York State School of Agriculture at St. Lawrence 
University, and another of $50,000 for the State College of Forestry 
at Syracuse University, ‘‘for administration, instruction * * * 
experimental and extension work through the State, etc.” The 
board of trustees of this college of forestry consists of the chancellor 
of Syracuse University and the State commissioner of education, ex 
officio, three members appointed by the governor, and six members 
(a clear majority) chosen by the university from its own trustees. 
Thus it is obvious that the control of the State appropriation is left, 
in final analysis, in the hands of a board of trustees composed of 23 
trustees at large, 6 alumni trustees, and 28 conference trustees chosen 
by various conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church. 
The legislature of 1913 went one step further than its predecessors 
toward larger indirect aid to institutions over which the State exer- 
cises only a general supervision. This law is an act ‘‘relative to the 
establishment of scholarships for the aid of students in colleges.” 
It establishes five State scholarships, to be maintained by the State, 
and to be ‘‘awarded each county annually for each assembly dis- 
trict therein;” each scholarship entitles the holder to $100 ‘‘for each 
year which he is in attendance upon an approved college in this State 
during a period of four years, to be paid to or for the benefit of such 
holder as hereinafter provided, out of a fund which is hereinafter 
created.’ The award is to be made by the commissioner of educa- 
tion, from a competitive list, according to rules made by the regents 
of the University of the State of New York governing, among other 
things, ‘‘the colleges which they (the scholars) shall attend.’ These 
rules may also ‘‘prescribe conditions under which payments may be 
made direct to the college attended by the person named in such 
certificate, in behalf and for the benefit of such person.’’ The act 
limits the number of scholarships to 20 for each assembly district, 
and to 3,000 for the. entire State, involving a possible maximum ex- 
pense of $300,000 annually. It excludes purely professional students 
from its privileges. 
The State of Massachusetts makes large appropriations for the 
Massachusetts Agricultural College under its control, but also lends 
its support to both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 
the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, neither of which is in any sense 
a State-controlled institution, though the governor, chief justice, and 
commissioner of education sit as ‘‘Representatives of the Common- 
wealth” with the 49 life members and term members of the corpo- 
ration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The latter 
institution has long sustained much the same relation to the State  
-P-A-G-E-78
    24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
that Cornell University does to New York in that it has shared, as an 
institution devoted to ‘‘the mechanic arts,” in the apportionment of 
the Federal land-grant funds. More recently both the Boston and 
Worcester institutions have received large continuing appropriations 
from the State treasury ‘‘to be expended under the direction of the 
corporation of said institute for the general purposes of the institu- 
tion.”’ For the year 1912 the annual appropriation to the Massa- 
chusetts Institute of Technology was $100,000, in consideration of 
giving 80 free scholarships, or 2 to each senatorial district, with the 
proviso that the appropriation for 1917 and the four following years 
should be withheld if the institute had not by that. date received 
additional gifts of $1,000,000. In the case of Worcester Polytechnic 
Institute the subsidy was $50,000, in consideration of 40 scholarships, 
with a similar proviso for raising $350,000 before 1917. The records 
do not show that any grants have been made to Boston University 
for training for business, or to Simmons College for training for 
women’s vocations and professions, or to Boston College, or to Tufts 
College, each of which is performing in its own way very useful 
service to the Commonwealth, comparable with that of the two great 
technological institutions just discussed. 
The State of Vermont in 1912 voted $12,000 to Middlebury College 
to be ‘‘expended by such institution in providing instruction in sub- 
jects essential for students preparing to teach in Vermont high schools 
and academies,” and in maintaining 30 scholarships of $80 each. 
Norwich University similarly received $20,000 for its general use, in 
consideration of maintaining scholarships and submitting to an exam- 
ination by a board of visitors consisting of two State officers and three 
appointees of the governor. The University of Vermont and State 
Agricultural College is in receipt of about $26,000 annually from the 
State, but so far as the university proper is concerned it is no more a 
State university than Cornell University, save that the board of 
trustees consists of the governor and the president of the university, 
ex officio, nine members ‘‘on the part of the University of Vermont,”’ 
and nine members ‘‘on the part of the State Agricultural College.” 
New Hampshire, like Vermont, subsidizes a privately controlled 
college through the grants to Dartmouth College, though it has four 
official members and five “councillors” who are ‘ex officio trustees of 
the college in relation to funds given by the State of New Hampshire,” 
in addition to the 11 regular ‘‘trustees of Dartmouth College and of 
Moor’s Charity School.” To its own New Hampshire College of Agri- 
culture and Mechanic Arts the State gives annually about $21,000. 
New Jersey has combined its land-grant college with Rutgers Col- 
lege, having declared in 1864 ‘‘The trustees of Rutgers College in New 
Jersey, maintaining Rutgers Scientifie School,”’ to be ‘‘The State Col- 
lege for the Benefit of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.” The
-P-A-G-E-79
  HIGHER EDUCATION, 25 
board of trustees of the college is supplemented by a board of visitors 
of the State college, consisting of two members from each congres- 
sional district in the State. For 1912 the State voted about $65,000 
for support of the college. 
Pennsylvania and Maryland have for many years made large 
appropriations to various private schools and colleges, but it is 
worthy of note in this connection that in both of these States are 
discernible signs of a distinct reaction against the policy under dis- 
cussion. At least one of the State boards of Maryland is making a 
careful survey of the support given by the State to educational and 
charitable institutions under the guise of scholarships. 
During the session of 1913 of the Pennsylvania Legislature bills 
were introduced calling for appropriations to a number of institu- 
tions. Among these was a bill which passed the senate appropri- 
ating $60,000 to Washington and Jefferson College, which was at 
that time engaged in a campaign to increase its endowment by half 
a million dollars. The bill was introduced without the knowledge of 
the college authorities. The board of trustees of the college felt that 
it would be inconsistent to accept such an appropriation after appeals 
had been made to persons on the ground that the college was not 
seeking State appropriations. Accordingly, the board passed the 
following resolution, which resulted in the withdrawal of the bill: 
Resolved by the executive board of trustees of Washington College, That in the opinion 
of this committee the State should not appropriate money to educational institutions 
not under direct State control, and therefore the Legislature of Pennsylvania should 
not be asked to pass the bills now pending making an appropriation to this college. 
In view of the fact that the bill for aiding this college had passed 
one house of the legislature, with every prospect of passing the other 
house, the reasons for the action of the college as stated by one of 
the college officials have peculiar pertinence to this discussion. 
The college was not always opposed to State aid. Several small appropriations to 
the two institutions out of which the present college grew had been made during the 
first 50 or 60 years of their existence; but since 1865, when they were united, no 
appropriation has been made. Moreover, it seemed to us from the constitution of 
the State adopted in 1873 that it was then determined that appropriations should not 
be made to any institutions not under direct State control, except in very peculiar 
circumstances, and then only by a two;thirds vote of the legislature. This principle, 
however, seems to have dropped out of sight, and appropriations to a few institutions 
have been made in increasing amounts according to the amount of political influence 
they could exercise, while many other institutions equally deserving are left to 
struggle to secure private gifts. 
The State of Rhode Island, through its legislature, has entered into 
cooperation with Brown University for the professional education 
of college graduates desiring to prepare for positions as high-school 
teachers or principals. Part of the sum appropriated is to be used in

carrying on graduate instruction and part for the maintenance of 
scholarships. 
The recent progress of Peabody Normal College, which resulted in 
the George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville, Tenn., illus- 
trates the unusual combination of private benevolence, municipal 
appropriation, and State appropriation. The control of the property 
and the details of the institution are left, however, entirely in the 
hands of a self-perpetuating board of trustees. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
  No single feature of improvement in higher education in the last 
seven years better deserves reiterated emphasis and approval than 
the progress in medical education. The changes of the last year 
give renewed cause for satisfaction. The continued decrease in the 
number of medical schools, from 162 in 1906 to 106 in 1913, is fresh 
evidence of sound appreciation of the vital necessity of most thorough, 
exacting, and scientific training in laboratories and actual, practical 
apprenticeship under expert direction in large hospitals. __ 
By the action of the Council on Medical Education of the American 
Medical Association, acting in cooperation with the Association of 
American Medical Colleges, a new milestone in the progress of medi- 
cal education was established in the spring of 1913. Step by step 
the curriculum of a standard medical school has been extended to 
cover four years; admission has advanced from the modest require- 
ment of the completion of high-school education to requirement of 
a preliminary college year, which should include at least physics, 
chemistry, and biology. Forty-three medical colleges at the close 
of the period covered by this report were enforcing at least this 
requirement; others have announced that it will go into effect in 
1913; still others have signified their intention to put it into opera- 
tion in 1914. By these schedules there should be after January, 
1914, 71 medical colleges requiring for entrance one year of college 
work, including courses in physics, chemistry, biology, and a mod- 
ern language. But this is not the whole story. Thirty of them, 
including those which require a bachelor’s degree for admission, 
now demand two years of work in a college of liberal arts, in addition 
to a high-school course covering four years, and nine have announced 
the adoption of the two-year collegiate requirement, to become 
effective before the end of 1915. 
The Council on Medical Education, by its announcement of the 
basis on which medical colleges will be rated in the council’s classi- 
fication as ‘Class A+, acceptable medical colleges,’”’ and ‘Class A, 
colleges lacking in certain respects, but otherwise acceptable,” has 
fixed and defined this new or collegiate requirement of a single year 
(see the Journal of the American Medical Association, vol. 61, pp. 582
-P-A-G-E-81
  
HIGHER EDUCATION, 27 
to 589, Aug. 23, 1913). This requirement for admission becomes 
effective on and after January 1, 1914. The Association of Medical 
Colleges expresses its requirement in slightly different terms—“one 
year each of physics, chemistry, and biology of college grade, each not 
less than eight hours.” While these two associations have no legal au- 
thority to compel the acceptance of their standards, the value of the 
recognition accorded to an institution by placing it in Class A+ or 
Class A is so great that ambitious institutions can not afford to defer 
compliance longer than is absolutely necessary. It should be noted 
in this connection that the information upon which classification by 
the council is made or admission to the Association of Medical Col- 
leges accomplished is based upon the direct personal examination of 
the work of institutions listed by an agent or by a committee of these 
two organizations. The rating, therefore, is not a paper-made affair, 
but one which commends itself because of its thoroughness and 
because it is continually kept up to date by visitation, conference, and 
correspondence. 
Confronted by the enormously increased cost of maintaining a first- 
class medical school, the movement to surrender medical education 
to the State university or to put it under the care of the State has 
gone on apace during the year under discussion. The medical col- 
lege of Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa, was transferred by a cor- 
dially amicable arrangement to the State University of Iowa; the 
medical college of Willamette University, Salem, Oreg., has been 
discontinued, and all medical education in Oregon will be carried on 
by the University of Oregon, in Portland. The State of South Caro- 
lina has adopted and made appropriations for the Medical College of 
the State of South Carolina, located at Charleston. An agreement 
has been perfected by which the University of Alabama will take 
over the Birmingham Medical College and make of it the postgrad- 
uate department of the university’s medical school. The College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, of Chicago, which has had an intermittent 
affiliation with the University of Iinois, without receiving any State 
aid, however, has recently turned over all its property to the univer- 
sity and gone out of existence as a separate corporation. State aid, 
which was once defeated by the veto of the governor and once by a 
decision of the supreme court of the State, seems now assured. The 
two medical schools in Richmond, Va., the Medical College of Virginia, 
which has received a small subsidy from the State, and University 
College of Medicine, which must not be confused with the medical 
school connected with the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, 
have united as the result of long negotiations. 
The financial resources of the medical schools have shown gratifying 
increases. State appropriations have been generous both for main- 
tenance and for buildings, while gifts running into the millions for hos- 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
    28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
pitals, for instruction, and for endowment of research fill the record 
of the year. The campaign of the Western Reserve University, of 
Cleveland, in the past two years resulted in a total of $1,533,000 of en- 
dowment for the medical department of that institution. During 
the past year the University of California received an aggregate of 
nearly $480,000 toward a total of $600,000 for a teaching hospital, 
and the George William Hooper Medical Endowment, consisting of 
property valued at considerably more than $1,000,000, perhaps ulti- 
mately $2,000,000, for purposes of medical research. 
INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
Provisions for an educational investigation and research in rela- 
tion to the organization and management of higher institutions have 
been made in various forms. Some of these apply to single States 
only, and relate primarily to State-supported institutions; others 
have no limitation upon their scope or area of investigation. In the 
former class should be placed the commission provided for by the act 
of the legislature of Vermont, November 19, 1912, creating an unpaid 
commission of nine persons, “‘at least two of whom shall be expert in, 
or engaged in educational work, whose duty shall be to inquire into 
the entire educational system and condition of the State,” and to 
report on the rights, duties, and obligations of the University of 
Vermont, and State Agricultural College, Middlebury College, and 
Norwich University, with such recommendations as will prevent 
unnecessary duplication and consequent loss from waste. This com- 
mission, when created, included not merely men of prominence 
within the State, but men prominent in the business world and in 
educational circles; for example, the president of the American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co., and the president of Columbia Uni- 
versity. This commission, furthermore, proceeded with a thorough- 
ness and breadth of plan unusual in the history of commissions. It 
drafted into its service experts connected with the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for Advancement of Teaching, and with the Teachers College of 
New York City. 
The State of Texas is receiving the benefits of the services of an 
“organization for the enlargement by the State of Texas of its insti- 
tutions of higher education.” This organization is backed by a sub- 
seription by the alumni and friends of the university amounting to 
approximately $30,000 per year for a period of five years. It has 
employed a secretary for research, and has already published several 
documents dealing with the organization and administration of 
State-supported institutions, with special reference to the State of 
Texas. One of its aims is to secure for all the State’s higher educa- 
tional institutions an adequate permanent revenue.
-P-A-G-E-83
HIGHER EDUCATION, 29 
A distinct endowment for educational research, to be conducted 
on the highest possible level, has been provided for by the addition 
of $1,250,000 to the funds of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advance- 
ment of Teaching. This sum is to be specifically devoted to educa- 
tional research and to the work which has already been undertaken 
in investigation of legal education somewhat along the lines of its 
report on “Medical Education in the University.’’ This gift assures 
a permanent income of sufficient amount to enable the foundation to 
carry on with thoroughness and deliberation almost any investigation. 
which it may determine upon. It is not easy to decide whether the 
obligation, the opportunity, or the promise presented by this endow- 
ment should be counted its most fortunate feature. 
Among the voluntary organizations which are carrying on vigorous 
investigations of single groups of institutions, prominence should be 
given to the Southern Association of College Women. For several 
years an annual report has been presented upon the organization 
standards and practices of colleges for women in the Southern States, 
The latest presentation of this subject appears under the title, 
“Tmprovement of the College since 1900,” presented in the proceed- 
ings of the tenth annual meeting of the association in April, 1913.

Conclusion. 
The progress made in medical education during the past eight or 
nine years has probably not been fully appreciated except by those 
directly connected with medical colleges or with universities having 
medical departments. During the 30 years prior to 1904, in all parts 
of the country there sprang up all manner of medical colleges, most 
of them being stock corporations conducted chiefly for the profits 
there were in them directly or indirectly for the stockholders, who 
were usually the “ professors.” The rapid development of the coun- 
try, the pushing of the frontier westward, and the springing up of 
new towns and cities created a great demand for doctors, so that 
medical schools became very profitable enterprises. The supply, 
however, soon far exceeded the demand, so that in 1904 the United 
States had nearly one-half of the world’s supply of medical schools, 
the total in that year being 161, not including about 15 colleges 
teaching the so-called “drugless methods” of treating human ail- 
ments. Schools of the latter class have never developed to an equal 
extent in foreign countries, which have always kept medical education 
in the control of the universities. During this 30-year period there 
were some medical schools which were integral parts of well-con- 
ducted universities, and in the latter part of this period a few which 
compared favorably with any medical school abroad. On the whole, 
however, fair educational standards were missing or were disre- 
garded, laboratories were few or entirely lacking, and clinical facili- 
ties varied from a fully adequate quantity in some schools to a total 
absence of them in others.

SOME AGENCIES WORKING FOR IMPROVEMENT. 
During this period also there sprang up in all sections of the 
country a large number of “ diploma mills,” which peddled diplomas 
for a consideration without any attempt to furnish medical training. 
Most of these were discovered and forced to close, largely through 
the efforts of one man, to whom medical education and the public 
are deeply indebted, Dr. John H. Rauch, who during the period from 
about 1878 to 1891 was secretary of the Illinois State Board of 
Health. Dr. Rauch during his official career collected voluminous 
statistics regarding medical colleges, students and graduates, and 
medical laws, which constitute the most reliable information existing 
about these matters during that period. It was chiefly through the 
facts collected by Dr. Rauch, and the publicity given to them, that 
medical schools extended their requirements for graduation from two 
to three annual sessions. The influence of his work was not limited 
to Illinois, but was felt throughout the entire country. His work 
pointed to the necessity of a strong national influence for the attain- 
ment of desirable and reasonable standards of preliminary and medi- 
cal education. The Association of American Medical Colleges was 
exerting considerable influence in fixing standards, although unfortu- 
nately that influence was limited to the colleges in membership. The 
American Medical Association, representing the organized medical 
profession of this country, was organized in 1846 for the express pur- 
pose of improving medical education, but its really effective worl 
in that direction did not begin until in 1900, when the Journal of that 
organization, under the able editorship of Dr. George H. Simmons, 
began publishing annually statistics regarding medical colleges, stu- 
dents, and graduates. In 1903, also under Dr. Simmons’s direction, 
was begun the annual publication of statistics showing the successes 
and failures of medical school graduates at the various State license 
examinations. 
THE RECENT CAMPAIGN FOR IMPROVEMENT. 
As will be noted in the accompanying chart, the number of medical 
colleges continued near the maximum until 1904, when the House of 
Delegates, the governing body of the American Medical Association, 
created a permanent committee, the Council on Medical Education.t 
The function of this council was to collect and publish reliable infor- 
    
1This committee was made up of the chairman, Dr. Arthur Dean Bevan, professor of 
surgery, Rush Medical College, Chicago; Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, professor of hygiene and 
physiological chemist Universi of Michigan, department of medicine and surgery, 
Ann Arbor; Dr, Charles H, Fr r, professor of surgery, U sity of Pennsylvania, 
department of medicine, Philadelphia; Dr. J. A. Witherspoon, professor of medicine, Van- 
derbilt University, med: department, Nashville; and Dr. W. T. Councilman, professor 
of pathology, Har ‘d University Medical School, Boston.

mation regarding medical education, and to do what it could to secure 
the adoption of better educational standards. With the organization 
of this permanent committee a vigorous campaign of improvement 
was initiated. The statistical work begun by the association’s Jour- 
nal was naturally placed in charge of this committee. An “ideal 
standard ” of preliminary and medical education was drawn up; an 
effort was made to correlate the work of the several agencies working 
for better educational standards; annual educational conferences 
were held at which representatives of State licensing boards, deans 
of medical colleges, university presidents, and others interested were 
invited, and at these conferences a full discussion was given to stand- 
ards and problems of medical education. The first three years were 
devoted chiefly to a careful investigation of the conditions in the 
medical schools of the United States, and in 1906 a personal inspec- 
tion was made of each of the 162 medical colleges then existing. In 
1907 the first classification of medical colleges, based on the council’s 
investigations, was presented at the third annual conference and was 
included in the council’s annual report to the American Medical 
Association. That classification was not published, but each college 
was notified of the rating given to it. 
From the beginning of its work the council particularly urged the 
adoption of higher entrance standards, in order that a better quality 
of students might be enrolled. In cities where two or more medical 
colleges existed mergers were advised, in order that there might be in 
each instance one stronger and better-equipped college. A rapid and 
voluntary improvement by the medical colleges was begun with an 
enthusiasm which was as surprising as it was encouraging. The re- 
sults have by far surpassed the highest expectations of those who 
started the campaign. That the improvements by the colleges have 
been so largely voluntary is the best guaranty that they are perma- 
nent. It is interesting to note that the marked diminution in the 
number of medical colleges began in 1907, following the appearance 
of the council’s first classification. 
Two other complete tours of inspection have since been completed 
by the council, and on the basis of the conditions found two subsequent 
classifications of the medical colleges have been prepared, and both of 
these were published. The second classification was published in 1910, 
simultaneously with the appearance of the report on Medical Educa- 
tion in the United States and Canada made by the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching. The third classification was 
published in January of the present year.”

PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 35 
In 1907 a list of foreign medical colleges was compiled by the 
council, which revealed the astounding fact that, of all the medical 
colleges in the world, this country had nearly one-half. Since 1906, 
however, as will be noticed in the chart, the number has been reduced 
from 162 to 106, the latter number approaching more nearly the nor- 
mal supply for this country. As may be noted in Table 1, since 1904 
there have been 79 colleges closed. Of this number 47 were closed by 
merger with other institutions, while 82—all but 2 having been 
rated in class C by the council—became extinct. That the total is 
still too large, however, is quite evident, since a score or more still

continue to exist through the use of skillfully worded, self-laudatory, 
or even misleading advertisements, and by an evasion of even the 
minimum legal standards for admission. Such colleges will con- 
tinue to exist just so long as State boards or ineffective medical- 
practice acts will continue to tolerate them. That the time may not 
be long, however, is evident from the fact that according to official 
statements received from the following 25 State licensing boards, 
diplomas from these inferior colleges are not recognized as an accept- 
able qualification for a license to practice medicine in those States:

Unless the other State boards adopt effective safeguards they are 
apt to become the dumping ground for the illiterate, poorly trained 
output of these low-grade colleges.

  36 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
FEWER BUT BETTER COLLEGES. 
Although in the total number of medical colleges in the United 
States there has been a marked reduction, on the other hand in the 
number which have adopted higher entrance standards there has 
béen a marked increase. In 1900 there were only two medical schools 
which required any preliminary training beyond a high-school course, 
and for the vast majority even the high-school requirement was 
merely nominal. As the chart shows, by 1910 the colleges requiring 
one or more years of collegiate work for admission had increased to 
40, and to 52 in the year 1913. In 1914, according to statements 
published in their announcements, 25 other colleges will put into 
effect the higher entrance standards, making a total of 77; over 75 
per cent of all colleges will have adopted the advanced requirements, 
As may be surmised, the marked reduction in the number of medical 
colleges has not been to the detriment of medical education, but has 
been to its advantage; it has not lessened the opportunities for 
students to study medicine, but has provided them with greater 
opportunities in better-equipped colleges. Even now many of the 
better colleges could, with their present teachers and equipment, 
care for from two to several times the number at present enrolled. 
The reduction has merely done away with the vast oversupply and 
has left a more nearly normal number which, in the meantime, has 
greatly improved in quality. The majority of medical colleges have 
not only ceased to compete with the high schools for students from 
the grammar-school grades, but also are directing into our universi- 
ties and colleges of liberal arts many students who otherwise would 
never have placed foot on a college campus. The medical school is 
no longer adding to the confusion of educational standards in this 
country, but is helping to bring about and uphold system and order. 
  ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS OF MEDICAL COLL) 
  As already inferred, entrance requirements to medical schools 
prior to 1900 were largely nominal and, with the exception of two 
colleges, consisted at most of a four-year high-school education. In 
all other leading nations, besides the secondary school training, one 
or two years of college work, including courses in physics, chemistry, 
and biology, were required. In 1905, therefore, in its first report to 
the American Medical Association, the Council on Medical Educa- 
tion presented what was then termed an “ ideal standard,”* which   
  
1The “ideal standard ” suggested by the council included : 
(a) Preliminary qualifications such as would admit a student to a standard university, 
and in addition 
(vb) The completion of at least one year devoted to college courses in physics, chemistry, 
biology, and a modern foreign language, preferably German or French. . ¢) A four-year cou in an gpbroned medical college, each session to consist of at 
least 30 weeks of actual work, exclusive of holidays, and 
(d) A fifth year spent by the student as an interne in an approved hospital, 
   
-P-A-G-E-91
  PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 87 
included the requirement of a year of work devoted to college courses 
in the sciences named, in addition to the completion of a standard 
four-year high-school course. By January 1, 1912, about 50 colleges 
had voluntarily adopted the higher preliminary requirement and 
were supported by 10 State licensing boards, which adopted one or 
two years of collegiate work as their minimum requirement of pre- 
liminary education for candidates seeking licenses in those States. 
In June, 1912, the American Medical Association adopted a resolu- 
tion directing the council, after January 1, 1914, to include among 
acceptable medical colleges (in class- A) only such colleges as were 
exacting the higher requirement for admission. In February, 1913, . 
the Association of American Medical Colleges adopted a resolution 
providing that only colleges rated as acceptable by the council could 
become or remain in membership. Five other State licensing boards 
and 27 other medical colleges have since adopted the increased re- 
quirement, so that the “ ideal” standard of 1905 has, in 1913, become 
the essential standard.   
THE STANDARD OUTLINED, 
The following schedule of minimum requirements for admission 
to medical colleges was adopted at a meeting of a joint committee 
representing the Council on Medical Education and the Association 
of American Medical Colleges, held March 22, 1913, with the advice 
of several experts in preliminary and general education, but espe- 
cially that of Dr. Kendrie C. Babcock, chief of the division of higher 
education of the United States Bureau of Education: 
ADMISSION TO THE PRELIMINARY COLLEGE YEAR. 
(a) For admission to the preliminary college year, students must have com- 
pleted a four-year course of at least 14 units in a standard accredited high 
school, or have its equivalent as demonstrated by an examination, and a tran- 
script of the student’s work should be secured direct from the principal of the 
high school by the college authorities and kept on file. 
(b) The required and elective subjects for which credits for admission to 
the preliminary college year may be accepted are shown in Table 3.      | |

  1A unit is the credit value of at least 36 weeks’ work of four or five retitation periods per week, each reci- 
tation period to be of not less than 40 minutes. In other words, a unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. A satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accomplished under ordinary circumstances in less than 120 sixty- ininute hours, or their equivalent. i 2 Required branches.—Ot the 14 units of high-school work the subjects in capitals, aggregating 7 units, are required. Other work to the amount of at least 7 units may be made up from any of the other subjects 
of the above schedule. 
8 Two units of Greek or Latin may be substituted for the two required units of French or German. 
4 Credentials of each science course must include evidence of laboratory work.   
WORK OF THE PRELIMINARY COLLEGE YEAR. 
(c) The preliminary college year shall extend through one college session of 
at least 32 weeks of actual instruction, including final examinations. 
(d) In excellence of teaching and in content, the work of this preliminary 
college year shall at least be equal to the work done in the freshman year in 
standard colleges and universities. 2 
(e) This preliminary college year shall include courses in physics, chemistry, 
biology, and French or German, each course to embrace at least eight semester 
hours of didactic and laboratory work in each subject, as shown in the following 
schedule, provided that a student may satisfy the requirement of physics in 
presenting one unit of high-school physics and completing a half year of college

1 Each laboratory period must extend over at least 2 hours. 
(f) If a satisfactory “reading knowledge” of German or French is to be 
ebtained in the one year of college work, it is essential that an advanced course 
be offered, and that the student have completed as a prerequisite in the high 
school two units of elementary work in German or French. 
(g) By requiring two years of collegiate work for admission, medical schools 
would have a greater latitude in the acceptance of high-school credentials. For 
example, the language requirement in the high school would not be so essential, 
since the deficiency could be made up in the two years of collegiate work. 
(h) It is understood, however, that a requirement of two or more years of 
collegiate work will not excuse the medical school from requiring the comple- 
tion of a standard four-year high-school course as a prerequisite to that college 
work. In other words, “college work” will not be recognized as such by the 
council unless the specified amount of high-school work has been required as a 
prerequisite. 
(i) It is also understood that a requirement of two or more years of col- 
legiate work will not be considered acceptable unless courses in physics, chemis- 
try, biology, and German or French, the minimum amount of which is specified 
in Table 4, are included. : 
(j) In medical colleges planning to give the work of the preliminary year, 
provision should be made for full-time expert teachers in the various subjects, 
and sufficient equipment should be provided to enable the students to do the 
work intelligently—in amount such as will compare favorably with the equip- 
ment for these courses in standard colleges and universities. \ 
(k) It should be remembered that the chief object of the work of the pre- 
liminary college year is to provide the student with a training that will enable 
him to enter more readily and intelligently on the study of the fundamental 
medical sciences in the medical school.

42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
By January 1, 1914, therefore, there will be 77, or 72.6 per cent of 
all medical colleges, which will have put into effect entrance require- 
ments of at least one year of college work, including courses in 
physics, chemistry, biology, and a modern language. 
REQUIREMENTS BY STATE LICENSING BOARDS. 
That the higher requirements adopted by the medical colleges 
named will be permanent is assured by the fact that 15 State medical 
licensing boards also have adopted preliminary requirements, con- 
sisting of one or two years of collegiate work, including the sciences 
named, in advance of a four-year high-school education. These are 
as follows:

The adoption of the advanced standard by State licensing boards 
is the result, rather than the cause, of the action taken by the medical 
colleges. As a rule, the adoption of higher requirements by each 
State board followed the action by the medical colleges of that State, 
or they were adopted simultaneously by the colleges and the board. 
It is this action by State licensing boards, however, which will force 
about 30 colleges, which will not do so voluntarily, to adopt reason- 
ably high requirements for admission. 
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN MEDICAL COLLEGES. 
The merging of two or more medical colleges into one in many 
cities has not only brought about a reduction of the abnormal over- 
supply of such institutions, but has also led to a remarkable internal 
development of those schools. More buildings, and therefore more 
space, were provided by the merger for the remaining school; the 
combining of the teaching force opened the way for a subsequent 
reorganization with the selection of the best teachers; the combined 
equipment of the two or more schools furnished a better equipment  
-P-A-G-E-97
    
PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 43 
of the laboratories of the one school than was possessed by any of 
its predecessors; hospital and dispensary facilities, formerly divided 
among the two or more colleges, were by the merger brought under 
a single control, where they could be more systematically and more 
effectively used in the training of young physicians. Incidentally, 
this more systematic control of hospital and dispensary patients has 
resulted in a better care of those patients. Above all, the merger 
of the two or more medical colleges resulted in a united medical pro- 
fession and a united citizenship back of the one school, and this in 
turn enabled the medical school to secure better support through local 
subscriptions and otherwise, not possible when there were two or 
more competing colleges. 
But the internal improvements have not been limited to the colleges 
formed by the merging process. The erection of new medical build- 
ings, the readjustment of the curriculum, the establishing of new 
laboratory courses, the purchasing of more adequate equipment, the 
securing of teaching hospitals (or of closer relationships with other 
hospitals), and the employing of a larger number of thoroughly 
trained, full-time teachers, have been the rule in the majority of 
medical colleges in all sections of the country. 
FULL-TIME EXPERT TEACHERS IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
The securing by the medical schools of thoroughly trained, full- 
time professors and teachers particularly for the laboratory branches, 
has been a very important development in recent years. Heretofore, 
in the majority of medical colleges, practically all teaching was done 
by busy practitioners during such spare hours as their practice would 
permit. During recent years, however, a decided change for the 
better has set in. In the second tour of inspection made by the 
Council on Medical Education (session of 1909-10), data were col- 
lected showing that, in the 131 medical colleges then existing, there 
were 648 full-time salaried instructors, or, on the average, about five 
for each medical college. Excluding the 47 colleges which did not 
have any such teachers, there were on the average for the remaining 
84 colleges between seven and eight full-time teachers. In 1910, 
therefore, in an outline of the essentials of an acceptable medical 
college, the council included a requirement that each institution 
should have at least six full-time, salaried instructors. During the 
college session of 1911-12, data collected. showed that in the 118 
medical colleges then existing there were 876 full-time instructors, 
and of this number 490 held professorial rank, making on the aver- 
age for each college between seven and eight full-time instructors, 
about four of whom held professorial rank. Omitting the 33 medical 
colleges which still did not have any full-time instructors, there were 
on the average for each of the remaining 85 colleges between 10 and  
-P-A-G-E-98
    44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
11 full-time instructors, of whom about six held professorial rank. 
Heretofore such full-time teachers have been secured only for the , 
laboratory branches. In recent years, however, there has appeared a 
tendency to provide full-time, salaried professors in the clinical 
departments also. In some medical schools the private practice of 
such teachers has been limited to consultation cases. More recently, 
at the Johns Hopkins Medical School, they will be permitted to prac- 
tice as they may choose, but are not to accept fees for such work. 
During the past two years there has been an unusual demand for 
full-time teachers, so that the next few years will doubtless show a 
still greater increase in the number employed. 
MEDICAL RESEARCH, 
Unquestionably the most important and far-reaching development 
in the medical schools of this country in recent years is that of 
medical research. No medical school can keep up-to-date either in 
medical knowledge or in methods of teaching, unless it is itself seek- 
ing to discover new truths in medicine. With the rapid expansion 
of medical knowledge, no medical teacher can well keep abreast of 
the knowledge of his particular subject unless he is more or less 
actively engaged in research work. Medical research is the very 
soul of medical education; without it the medical school is a mere 
machine, teaching the discouraging facts regarding morbid processes, 
sickness, and death, without the inspiration of encouragement and 
hopefulness which comes from delving after new truths and from the 
discovery of new methods of alleviating disease and pain. In the 
medical school without research the highest ideal held by the student 
may often be the financial returns he may gain from his practice. 
In the research school, on the contrary, by the time he graduates 
the student is led to realize how boundless are the possibilities of 
usefulness of medicine, and that his medical study has just begun. 
It is doubtless the research school which turns out the best practi- 
tioners of medicine, and those who are best able to cope with the 
modern problems of sanitation and disease prevention. 
RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS, 
During the college session of 1906-7 the inspection of all medical 
colleges revealed the fact that of the 131 medical colleges then exist- 
ing, in only about 30 was any medical research carried on, and in 
about half of these, such as was done was through the efforts of one 
or two individual teachers in each college, who were already seri- 
ously overburdened with classroom work. By the session of 1911-12, 
however, the number of medical schools in which any research was 
done had increased to about 60 colleges. In 20 of these, systematic
-P-A-G-E-99
  PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION, 45 
and regularly conducted research work was carried on by four or 
more full-time instructors in each school; in 20 others, two or three 
individuals in each were engaged in research work; and in each of 
20 other schools a little of such work was carried on by a single full- 
time teacher during such odd times as he could spare from his other 
duties. While there has been an encouraging increase in the num- 
ber of medical schools carrying on such work, it is still true that 
regular, systematic, persistent, and effective research in medical 
schools is practically at its beginning in this country. The rapid 
extension of such work among medical colleges can not fail to have 
great results in a better knowledge of medicine, in better methods 
of treatment, in better trained teachers, in better qualified physi- 
cians, and in a better treatment of the sick. 
INCREASED CLINICAL FACILITIES, 
Another marked development in medical education is the provision 
for more adequate clinical facilities by a larger number of medical 
colleges, either through securing hospitals both owned and con- 
trolled by the medical school or through contract relationships with 
large hospitals whereby the medical college has been given more 
liberal control of the clinical facilities. This is an exceedingly im- 
portant matter in medical education. If young physicians are to go 
forth properly qualified to recognize and treat the various complex 
disorders that affect mankind, it is necessary that during their medical 
course they have the opportunity, under proper‘supervision, to study 
sick patients at the bedside in the hospital. Therefore the medical 
school, to be properly equipped, needs the charity hospital. 
The belief is growing that among the best-conducted hospitals in 
the country, those which are most up to date in their methods, and 
these which are rendering the best service to their patients, are the 
teaching hospitals of high-grade medical schools. It is believed also 
that for the attending staff of the modern hospital no better-qualified 
physicians could be obtained than those who are actively connected 
with a strong, thoroughly equipped medical school, especially if the 
latter is one which is fostering medical research. By such a combi- 
nation the hospital is in position to fulfill its triple function of (a) 
rendering the best possible care to its patients, (b) adding to the 
known facts of medicine through medical research, and (c) prepar- 
ing for the community well-qualified nurses and physicians. 
Recognizing this threefold function, during the past few years 
there has been a tendency on the part of the larger hospitals to seek 
closer relationship with modern medical schools. As examples may 
be mentioned the Cincinnati City Hospital with the medical depart- 
ment of the University of Cincinnati; the city hospital of Augusta 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
    46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
with the University of Georgia medical department; the Mercy and 
St. Frances Hospitals with the medical department of the University 
of Pittsburgh; and, more recently, the Presbyterian Hospital of New 
York City with Columbia University College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons; the new Barnes and St. Louis Children’s Hospitals with 
Washington University school of medicine; the new Long Hospital 
with Indiana University school of medicine; and the new Peter Bent 
Brigham Hospital and other allied hospitals with Harvard Uni- 
versity medical school. 
In the investigation made by the Council on Medical Education 
during the session of 1906-7 it was found that of the 131 medical 
colleges then existing only 24 (18 per cent) either owned or had 
very liberal control of hospitals having on the average over 150 
patients which could be utilized for clinical teaching, and about 10 
others were making careful and systematic use, with more or less 
limited privileges, of clinical material in one or more near-by hos- 
pitals. Another 15 either owned and controlled small hospitals or 
were apparently making fair use of facilities in distant and scattered 
hospitals. During the session of 1911-12, by contrast, of the 118 
medical colleges then existing, there were 38 (30 per cent) which 
either owned or had liberal control of the patients in hospitals fur- 
nishing adequate clinical material for the classes enrolled; about 15 
others were apparently making careful and systematic use, with more 
or less limited privileges, of clinical material in one or more near-by 
hospitals, and about 10 others either owned and controlled hospitals 
having a comparatively inadequate number of clinical patients or 
were making fair use of facilities in distant and scattered hospitals. 
COST OF TEACHING MEDICINE, 
One of the reasons for the reduction in the number of medical col- 
leges has doubtless been the heavy expense required to furnish train- 
ing in accordance with present-day medical knowledge. The better 
buildings which are needed, the extensive equipment required for 
the several laboratories, the large sums essential to maintain a mod- 
ern library and museum (and sometimes also to maintain a dis- 
pensary and hospital), as well as the large income needed to employ 
an ample corps of expert, full-time instructors, have long since 
caused the expense of maintaining a modern medical school to far 
exceed the income derived from students’ fees. During 1912 reports 
received from 65 medical colleges, giving for each the total cost of 
maintenance and the total amount received from students’ fees, 
showed that the average amount paid out for the teaching of each 
student by these 65 colleges was $410, while the average amount re- 
ceived in fees from each student was $122.1. The excesses of cost over 
  
1 Figures quoted show income and expense for each student for a period of one year,
-P-A-G-E-101
  PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 47 
income per student in eight schools were, respectively, $2,744, $1,863, 
$897, $747, $730, $673, $518, and $500. The excess of expense over 
income from fees per student was over $200 in 28 of the medical col- 
leges which reported. It is safe to say that with the same equipment 
and at practically no additional expense these schools could easily 
accommodate two, three, or in some instances several times the num- 
ber of students at present enrolled, which would greatly reduce the 
disproportion of expense over income from fees. A further reduc- 
tion in the vast oversupply of medical schools in this country, there- 
fore, would be in the interests of economy as well as of marked 
advantage to medical education. 
While the cost of teaching medicine has greatly increased, the cost 
to the individual student has only moderately increased. The cost to 
the student in some of the medical schools rated in class C by tho 
Council on Medical Education is much greater than in some of the 
best university schools. Some of the State university medical schools 
charge fees as low as $50 to $80 per year, while, on the other hand, 
some class C colleges require fees as high as $100 to $175 per year. 
The plea which is sometimes heard for the continued existence of 
low-grade colleges in the interest of the “poor boy who wants to 
get a medical education,” therefore, is apparently more for the boy 
who is poor in scholarship rather than for the boy who is poor in 
purse. A movement has been started meanwhile to provide scholar- 
ships for worthy students who are without ample funds. There 
is no reason, therefore, for a student to spend his time and money 
in a low-grade college, the diplomas of which are now not recognized 
in the majority of States, when in the same time and for even less 
money he can get a thorough medical training in one of the best- 
equipped colleges in the country. 
ENDOWMENTS FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
From what has just been said, it is apparent that if the physicians 
of the future are to be trained,in accordance with present-day medi- 
cal knowledge, the medical college must have a considerable income 
in addition to that obtained from students’ fees. The medical school 
must have either State aid or private endowment. A splendid be- 
ginning toward this end has been made during the past several 
years. As the colleges have advanced their standards and have made 
improvements, the more generous have been those who had money to 
give. What President Eliot said in a medical conference in 1908+ 
is true, that “the way to get endowments for medicine is to im- 
prove medical education.” During the past few years several gifts, 
each amounting to from one to four millions of dollars, have been

-P-A-G-E-102
  48 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
given for medical education, teaching hospitals, or for medical re- 
search in medical colleges; a larger number of donations have been 
made, of which each amounted to hundreds of thousands, and in a 
dozen or more medical colleges located in various sections of the 
country local campaigns for funds have resulted in the collection of 
sums varying from $5,000 to $100,000. State legislatures also are 
becoming more liberal in their appropriations for medical education. 
There are now 27 State universities which have medical departments, 
and for each of them funds have been supplied by the legislature, 
either ina special appropriation for the medical school direct or 
included in the general appropriation for the university as a whole. 
In several States this year appropriations for medical education were 
made for the first time, while in others the appropriations were 
largely increased. 
THE HOSPITAL INTERNE YEAR. 
A very important part of the young physician’s training is that 
obtained while serving as an interne or resident physician in a hospi- 
tal. Following the completion of his laboratory and clinical instruc- 
tion, an interneship in a hospital gives him an opportunity to develop 
technical skill and to apply the knowledge he has previously obtained. 
It gives him confidence in his knowledge and ability, and he is better 
fitted to begin the practice of medicine in his chosen location. From 
ihe standpoint of the patients he is to serve, the hospital training is of 
even more importance, since the first application of the young physi- 
cian’s knowledge is in the hospital under the watchful eyes of the 
attending physicians, and false steps, sometimes liable to prove disas- 
trous, are thereby prevented. 
Recognizing the great importance of this hospital training, in 1905 
the Council on Medical Education in its “ ideal standard ”+ of medi- 
cal education, besides the higher entrance standard already referred 
to, suggested that a fifth year be added to the medical course, this 
year to be spent by the student as an interne in a hospital. It was 
seen that most of the graduates of the better medical colleges were 
voluntarily taking these interneships, recognizing that such experi- 
ence was an important part of their medical training. Inquiry made 
regarding the classes graduating in 1911 showed that, for the better 
colleges, from 30 to 90 per cent of the graduates had obtained interne- 
ships. The deans of about 80 of the leading medical colleges stated 
that the demand from hospitals for internes was greater than they 
could supply. For the classes graduating in 1912, reports received 
from 65 medical colleges showed that about 70 per cent of the grad- 
uates had cbtained interneships. Statements from many of these in-

PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 49 
dicated that there were more than enough places to have supplied 
all the graduates with hospital positions had they desired them. In 
this connection it is interesting to know that in 1910 the University 
of Minnesota medical school extended its course for the M. D. degree 
to five years, including the interne year, for students matriculating 
for the session of 1911-12 and thereafter. This year Rush Medical 
College, Chicago, which has provided an optional fifth year since 
1905, voted to include the hospital year in the required course for the 
M. D. degree for students matriculating in the summer of 1914 and 
thereafter. Leland Stanford Junior University department of medi- 
cine, San Francisco, this year adopted a similar requirement, like- 
wise to become effective in 1914. By an amendment to the medical 
practice laws of Pennsylvania, adopted in July, 1918, candidates for 
the license to practice medicine in that State hereafter, must first 
have completed at least a year’s interneship in an approved hospital, 
During the past year a beginning has been made toward the in- 
vestigation and classification of hospitals, making particular inquiry 
regarding their patients, equipment, methods, and willingness to 
furnish a satisfactory training for internes. Incidentally, no hospital 
could be considered as acceptable if it did not strictly observe sani- 
tary laws, or did not furnish care to its patients in accordance with 
present-day medical knowledge. In the reports received some inter- 
esting information was secured. There are in this country about 
2,500 hospitals, having on the average 100 beds each, and 850 of 
these reported about 3,000 internes in active service. Since the term 
of interne service is 18 oe these 850 hospitals provide places for 
2,000 internes each ye In this proportion the 2,500 hospitals 
would provide places sr: about 6,000 internes each year. The total 
number of graduates from the medical schools of the United States 
has been he each year on the average for the past five years. It 
is safe to say, therefore, that the campaign just begun among hos- 
pitals by e Counell on Medical Education should recall within the 
next few years in providing ample opportunities for every medical 
graduate to secure experience in a good hospital before entering on 
his private practice. It is evident also that in a considerable num- 
ber of States the hospital interneship will be required as a prere- 
quisite for the license within the next few years. 
      POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL INSTRUCTION. 
The marked development in recent years of undergraduate educa- 
tion in this country and the numerous mergers of medical colleges 
should and doubtless will be followed by a campaign for the develop- 
ment of postgraduate medical instruction. The improved medical 
schools will hereafter turn out physicians who are more thoroughly 
17726°—xp 1913—vor 1——4 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
    
  50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
trained and in every way better equipped to practice medicine. 
There needs to be something done, however, for physicians who have 
long been in practice and who graduated when medical knowledge had 
not reached its present bounds and when medical schools were not so 
well equipped to give medical instruction as at present. Again, the 
knowledge regarding medicine is constantly changing, new methods 
of diagnosis and treatment are continually being discovered, and 
there is greater need for specialization. There should, therefore, be 
established, particularly in our larger cities, courses which all prac- 
ticing physicians, whether recent graduates or not, could occasionally 
attend in order to keep in touch with these more recent developments. 
Such courses for physicians should differ essentially from those 
given to undergraduate students and should be given separately. 
Whereas the courses for the student must necessarily touch upon all 
the known facts of medicine, the courses provided for the graduate 
physician should be such as to permit him to concentrate his research 
along certain narrow lines; in these courses, as in so many of the post- 
graduate courses abroad, the student-physician should perform the 
operations, under the careful guidance of the teacher, and these 
courses should be of sufficient number to enable the physician to make 
good use of the few weeks or months which he can occasionally spare 
from his practice. The physician depends on his practice for a living, 
and that practice requires the physician’s personal attention. Never- 
theless, he could and doubtless would avail himself occasionally of 
any opportunity to perfect himself along modern medical lines if in 
a few weeks or months he could secure, in a city near by, courses 
which were of actual value to him. 
In the majority of American cities at the present time no post- 
graduate courses are available, and in the few cities where such work 
is given, as compared with some foreign cities, the courses are not of 
such quantity as to permit a very satisfactory selection. To take 
such few courses as are offered along any desired specialty would still 
leave much time which the physician would have to spend in less 
essential work or which would be entirely lost. Worse still, it is only 
too frequently the case that after a physician has spent much time in 
finding out what courses are offered in a city and has spent still more 
time in locating the courses deemed desirable he learns, perhaps, that 
the courses selected conflict and that only one or two can be taken, 
How much better if ail the hospitals and dispensaries in each city 
were affiliated under a centralized control, at least so far as their post- 
graduate material was concerned, so that the largest number of good 
courses could be organized, good teachers found, the patients properly 
classified, and all conflicts avoided. The centralized administration 
could then publish schedules of the various courses and circulate them 
widely among the physicians of the surrounding community, thereby
-P-A-G-E-105
  
PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 51 
taking the initiative in urging physicians to avail themselves of these 
opportunities for keeping abreast of modern changes in medicine. 
The centralized control would help to develop the various post- 
graduate courses, which would soon become recognized, so that a 
physician of the community on finding a particularly interesting 
patient could refer it to the special course dealing with that disorder. 
It is undoubtedly the centralized control of postgraduate clinical 
material in each of the several continental cities of Europe which has 
made those cities famous from the standpoint of postgraduate medical 
instruction. Meanwhile, it is worthy of note that in each of those 
famous centers—e. g., Vienna, Berlin, and Paris—there is only one 
strong university medical school. In London, on the contrary, there 
are 12 medical colleges, each controlling its own hospital or group of 
hospitals and, although that city has a much larger population and 
possesses a greater abundance of clinical patients, it has’never held 
so great a reputation for postgraduate medical teaching as the cities 
on the Continent. The reason is clearly the lack of a centralized con- 
trol, which has prevented the most effective use of the material at 
hand. This, at least, is the view expressed in a recent article by an 
English authority on that subject. 
There is in each of many large American cities an abundance of 
hospital and dispensary material which could be used for postgrad- 
uate instruction, to the great advantage not only of the hospitals 
and dispensaries and of their patients, but also to the advantage of 
the physicians taking the courses, and of the entire community. It 
would be of an advantage to the hospital because of the atmosphere 
of medical investigation and research which would be engendered ; 
the hospital could better fulfill its obligation to the community 
which supports it; by such teaching the hospital would be the center 
of a distinct organization, making it more widely known among 
physicians, and physicians would doubtless cooperate more with the 
hospital by referring patients to it, including many, perhaps, which 
would be of particular interest and of service in the teaching courses 
offered by that hospital. Such an arrangement would be of advan- 
tage to the patients in the various institutions, because the physicians 
conducting the classes and on the attending staffs would be kept more 
alert and up to date in their various specialties; it would be of 
great advantage to the practicing physicians attending the courses, 
since they would be kept in touch with modern medical knowledge; 
and it would be of advantage to the community through the devel- 
opment of modern research hospitals and of a more thoroughly 
trained and up-to-date medical profession, who could not only give

their patients better care through the use of more modern and im- 
proved methods, but would also be kept in touch with the best 
methods for the preservation of public health. 
Recognizing the need along: the line of postgraduate medical 
instruction, the Council on Medical Education has already begun an 
investigation of the postgraduate medical schools now existing. 
This, in all probability, will be followed by a campaign for a more 
extensive development of this kind of instruction. The past year 
has witnessed the strengthening of some of the postgraduate schools 
already existing and also the beginning of a few additional post- 
graduate schools, notably that of Harvard University at Boston. 
The last-named institution has taken the right attitude by bringing 
into affiliation as many of the hospitals of the city of Boston as pos- 
sible. In order to bring about a still more centralized control of 
clinical facilities in the various cities of this country a further merger 
of medical colleges in those cities would be an important step. 
GRADUATE COURSES IN PUBLIC HEALTH. 
The abundance of information brought to light in the past 30 
years regarding the microbic origin of many diseases has revolu- 
tionized the methods used in public-health work. Where formerly 
the etiology of most diseases was theoretical and more or less un- 
certain, now the causes of many of the more prevalent diseases are 
clearly understood, the microbic cause of each having been deter- 
mined with scientific accuracy. This knowledge has also indicated 
how great the possibilities are of preventing disease through the use 
of intelligent methods. In recent years there has been a marked 
extension of work along this line, and an increasing number of public- 
health officers are employed. It is coming to be recognized, however, 
that those who are to become health officers should secure a special 
training, in addition to the medical course. The medical training is 
essential, since the health officer has to deal with diseases that afflict 
mankind; in dealing with the problems of water supply and sewage 
disposal he needs some knowledge of engineering and architecture; 
for the preparation and enforcement of proper sanitary measures he 
needs some knowledge of law; to prevent diseases due to long hours, 
to occupations, to improper housing, and to man’s relationship with 
man, he needs a knowledge of sociology and economics; to ward off 
diseases brought to a community from other climes he should be 
widely acquainted with political, physical, and medical geography. 
The fact that lines regarding which he needs to have a knowledge 
are so numerous has led to the creation of special graduate courses 
for public-health officers. Some medical schools have attempted to 
lay special emphasis on public-health work in the already over-
-P-A-G-E-107
  
PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 53 
crowded undergraduate curriculum, but this of necessity requires 
that time be taken from other topics of perhaps greater importance. 
More logical, therefore, is the reasoning that specialization is fully 
as important in public-health matters as it is in other lines of medical 
work, and that special graduate courses should be provided. For a 
number of years such courses have been offered by several English 
universities, leading to the Diploma in Public Health (D. P. T1.), 
and in the past few years graduate courses have been established by 
four universities in this country. In 1909 the University of Penn- 
sylvania established a ccurse covering one year leading to the degree 
of Doctor of Public Health (Dr. P. H.) for graduates in medicine, 
and the certificate of Certified Sanitarian (C. S.) for those not 
holding the M. D. degree. In 1910 Harvard University likewise 
established a course of one year for graduates in medicine leading 
to the degree of Doctor of Public Health. In 1911 the University of 
Michigan established a one-year course for graduates holding the 
A. B. or B. S. and M. D. degrees, leading to the degree of Master of 
Science in Public Health, and a two-year course leading to the degree 
of Doctor of Public Health. Also, in 1911, the University of Wis- 
consin established a one-year course for graduates in medicine or in 
medical or sanitary science, leading to a Diploma of Public Health. 
Courses of a similar nature are contemplated at other universities. 
TROPICAL MEDICINE, 
The activity of the United States Public Health Service in recent 
years in Cuba, Porto Rico, Panama, and the Philippine Islands has 
called attention to certain disorders originating chiefly in tropical 
climates and due to special forms of bacteria or to protozoa. This 
has led to the establishment of special courses in tropical diseases in 
several of the leading medical schools. The study of these disorders 
has been deemed important enough by Tulane University of Louisiana 
and by Harvard University to warrant the creation by each of a 
special school of tropical medicine, provided with a full corps of 
expert investigators. Researches by such schools in the next few 
years are bound to result in a better knowledge of many disorders 
regarding which hitherto very little was known. 
HINDRANCES TO PROGRESS. 
The chief hindrance to progress in all lines of medical education 
in the United States is the lack of a single national legal control of 
all educational matters, including medical colleges. In fact, most 
ef the evils which have arisen in general and medical education in 
this country are the direct result of the confusion and conflict of 
standards held by the multiplicity of independent boards having 
these matters in charge.
-P-A-G-E-108
  54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In every other country having a standing comparable with that of 
the United States the control of education is a function of the 
National Government. Medical education in those countries has 
never been separated from the universities, and low-standard, com- 
mercial, and sectarian institutions calling themselves medical col- 
leges, or colleges of this or that system of treatment, never gained a 
foothold. The same or higher standards were enforced for the 
medical school as for the other departments of the university; medi- 
cal education has always held a dignified place; and uneducated or 
improperly trained doctors are rare exceptions, if found at all. 
In the United States, on the contrary, the National Constitution 
throws the responsibility for educational standards on the individual, 
States—a responsibility (regarding medical education, at least) which 
even now has not been fully appreciated or fully assumed by many 
of the States. In most States to-day, any group of men could secure 
the legal right to open a medical college, and no questions would be 
asked regarding their resources or ability to furnish a medical educa- 
tion. From the standpoint of legal control, medical education has 
been largely divorced from other kinds of education and separate 
boards have been provided to administer it. There is, therefore, a 
great multiplicity of boards having in charge the various departments 
of education. For medical education alone, in the 49 States, instead 
of a single law providing a single standard, there are 49 different 
medical-practice acts providing 49 different and often conflicting 
standards. Yet these are the only barriers which have been placed 
between the public and the thousands who seek the right to treat 
human ailments, including the incompetent or imperfectly trained 
product of low-grade medical colleges. Worse still, the enforcement 
of these laws is placed in the hands of 62 different and independent 
boards, in several instances there being two or three boards to a State. 
Even then, other laws have been adopted in 20 or more States provid- 
ing special boards and easy educational standards for licensing the 
graduates of a legion of institutions teaching under various names 
only portions of the medical course, but which grant degrees of 
“Doctor” of this, that, or the other—the public do not know the 
difference, since they naturally expect that only properly educated 
“ doctors” will be licensed. Meanwhile, sectarian medicine is not 
so much a problem of medicine as it is a problem of education—of 
educational standards. That every “system” or method of treat- 
ment has some value may be taken for granted. The main question 
to be considered is: Has this “ practitioner ” had sufficient education 
and training to enable him to recognize the disease he is attempting 
to treat, and to know whether his particular “ specialty ” is the one 
Including the District of Columbia.
-P-A-G-E-109
PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. 55 
to be used or whether it is the very one most dangerous to the patient? 
One standard—an educational standard—therefore, should be upheld 
in the licensing of all who practice the healing art. And unless the 
colleges training such “ doctors” are adhering to reasonable educa- 
tional standards, and unless they possess the adequate teachers, labora- 
tories, and clinical facilities, they should not be considered worthy 
of recognition. 
It is not surprising that, with all this confusion and conflict of 
authority, low-grade medical colleges and schools for every medical 
fad in the category have grown up like toadstools. Even though one 
State may be blessed with excellent control, there remain the other 
48 in some of which the “ graduates” of these heterodox institutions 
may obtain licenses. If an ignorant or conscienceless practitioner has 
his license revoked in one State, he merely moves across the State line, 
when he seldom has difficulty in securing another license. Often, 
however, the powers of the local board are so limited or so hedged in 
that even though his license may be revoked, the low-grade “ doctor ” 
can defiantly continue in practice. Instances could be given where 
State licensing boards have withdrawn recognition from medical 
colleges, but which continue to exist by having their graduates go to 
other States in which the boards are willing to examine them. The 
great need in this country is a single or unified control of these mat- 
ters, which can not be hampered by local or petty influences. Surely, 
the dignity of this great Nation should no longer permit the contin- 
uance of this dire confusion in educational standards. 
During the past several years there has been considerable im- 
provement of standards and of methods in many individual States 
(see Table 6), and within the last two years there has been formed

develop the most satisfactory methods of examination; and. to bring 
out an equally effective and efficient administration of the State 
medical license laws in all States. The enforcement of educational 
standards in medicine and the fixing of barriers against incompetent 
practitioners are educational problems of the utmost importance— 
they are matters of life and death to that portion of the public who 
are unfortunate enough to need the care of a physician, There 
should be established, at least in each State, a single minimum edu- 
cational standard governing institutions teaching medicine and goy- 
erning those who are to practice the healing art. 
IN CONCLUSION. 
The past several years have witnessed great strides in the improve- 
ment of medical education and educational standards, and this prog- 
ress has been continued during the past year. But there still remains 
much to be done.’ The campaign is one in which the public should be 
chiefly interested, and it should be kept up with the consciousness 
that the improvement in medical colleges, the extension of medical 
research, the better hospital relations, the stronger postgraduate 
courses, and a unified and more effective control of medical educa- 
tion will produce for this eountry better trained physicians. This, 
in turn, means better care of the sick and suffering, a better knowl- 
edge of public health problems, and a greater preservation of health 
and happiness.

BEGINNINGS OF DENTAL EDUCATION. 
Dental education as an organized system had its inception in the 
founding of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in Baltimore, 
Md., in 1840. Previous to that date no means existed for the sys- 
tematic education of the practitioner of dentistry, and the qualifica- ~ 
tion for dental practice, such as it was before that time, was derived 
from two distinctly different sources: The first, men educated as phy- 
sicians who from preference, or more often because they had not 
attained a satisfying success in medical practice, turned to dentistry 
in the hope of improving their incomes; and, second, laboratory arti- 
sans whose manual skill enabled them to construct prosthetic appli- 
ances or perform the simpler restorative operations characteristic 
of the earlier period of dental practice. The first class lacked the 
manual constructive ability of the latter, and the latter was without 
the medical and surgical knowledge, such as it then was, ‘of the former. 
While the founding of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery by 
Horace H. Hayden and Chapin A. Harris inaugurated a movement 
and established an ideal in dental education which has since been 
largely attained, the persistence of the original impress made by the 
two modes of educational approach to dental practice before the 
establishment of the premier dental college is ‘still manifest in the 
ideals of dental education advocated and represented in the system 
in vogue at the present time. 
It is of interest to note that, previous to the founding of the first 
dental college, application was made by the originators of the enter- 
prise to the medical faculty of the University of Maryland, asking 
that body to add to the course of medical instruction given in that 
57
-P-A-G-E-112
58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
institution a course of lectures and facilities for training students for 
dental practice. The proposition was rejected by the medical faculty 
on the ground that the dental specialty was of no importance, and it 
was the rejection of this proposition which determined Hayden and 
Harris to provide means for the systematic education of dentists by 
founding an independent institution. 
It is doubtless a fact that this incident determined the placing of 
dental education upon a basis separate from medicine as an inde- 
pendent educational enterprise. It is also a fact that the original 
purpose of the pioneers in dental education to make the training of 
dentists a recognized part of the medical curriculum suggested a motif 
in dental education that has never been wholly lost. Indeed, not- 
withstanding the extraordinary development which has characterized 
the practical development of dental education upon an independent 
basis, there has been a continuous effort, to a degree successful, to 
combine the educational preparation for dental practice with a 
complete training in medicine marked finally by the medical degree. 
It is worthy of note that the survival of these two educational motifs 
in dentistry is represented by two classes of educators. Those who 
hold that the education of the dentist should be attained through a 
curriculum specially designed throughout to meet the requirements 
of a distinct profession; and another class who hold that the dentist 
should first fulfill the requirements for the medical degree, and should 
superadd thereto the training necessary to equip him for meeting 
the special requirements of dental practice. The latter class designate 
their field of activity as stomatology and themselves as stomatolo- 
gists, and-contend that the terms ‘‘dentistry” and ‘‘dentist” are 
too restrictive to designate the full professional activity of the stoma- 
tologist. Broadly considered with respect to the scope and utility 
of their bearing upon the field of activity which constitutes the recog- 
nized territory of the dental practitioner, the two ideals are repre- 
sentative of a distinction in point of view rather than of any real 
difference in éducational efficiency. 
THE ORIGINAL CURRICULUM. 
In the founding of the first dental college the arrangement of the 
educational curriculum, as well as the mode of teaching, was largely 
patterned after the methods in vogue in the medical schools of the 
period. Medical education in the United States in 1840 was in its 
infancy. There were no legal restrictions upon the practice of 
medicine in the sense in which we understand such restrictions 
to-day. The attainment of a medical diploma was considered to be 
evidence of sufficient training to entitle the holder thereof to prac- 
tice the profession of medicine without examination and license
-P-A-G-E-113
  
DENTAL EDUCATION. 59 
from the State. No standard of educational fitness was required 
of matriculates as a prerequisite for admission to medical classes. 
The course consisted of two brief annual sessions of four months 
each, the second course being usually a repetition of the first. The 
institutions depended for their income upon the revenues received 
from students, and the faculties participated in the profits of the 
educational enterprise. All these factors tended to enlarge the 
size of the classes, to make graduation easy, and to increase the 
income of the institutions, but correspondingly to lessen the educa- 
tional equipment of the students. While these conditions may 
be said to characterize the state of medical education of the period 
as a whole, it is scarcely necessary to add that, despite the many 
obstacles with which they were compelled to contend, there were 
many brilliant examples of high attainment, both as teachers and 
as students. 
LATER DEVELOPMENT OF DENTAL SCHOOLS. 
The success attained by the first dental school quickly demon- 
strated the need for such institutions, and others rapidly followed. 
The Ohio Dental College, in Cincinnati, was chartered in 1845; the 
Transylvania School of Dentistry, in Kentucky, and the Philadelphia 
College of Dental Surgery, in 1850; the New York College of Dental 
Surgery, in Syracuse, in 1852; the Pennsylvania College of Dental 
Surgery in 1856; the New Orleans Dental College in 1861; the 
Philadelphia Dental College in 1863; the New York College of 
Dentistry in 1865; the Missouri Dental College, in St. Louis, in 
1866; and the Dental School of Harvard University in 1867. At 
present the total number of educational institutions in the United 
States providing courses of instruction leading to the dental degree 
is 48. The total number of graduates for 1912 was 1,940, of which 
number 1,239 passed the various State licensing examinations and 
213 failed to pass, leaving 488 graduates who failed to apply for an 
American State license. Presumably many of them were of foreign 
origin and returned to practice in their native countries. 
The unsatisfactory state of affairs due to lack of admission require- 
ments sufficiently stringent to exclude the educationally unfit, and 
the necessity for sufficiently large classes to maintain the schools 
upon aremunerative basis, led to methods of competition for student 
patronage which became exceedingly objectionable to those who had 
the higher interests of dental education at heart. An effort was 
made, therefore, to correct the evils by concerted action, and to 
that end a meeting of educators was called for the discussion of the 
general problem of dental education. The movement resulted in 
the creation in 1884 of the National Association of Dental Faculties. 
From the activities of this body a fair degree of unification of the

curriculum leading to the dental degree has been achieved, minimum 
standards of qualifications for admission have been established, and 
abuses formerly arising from irregular methods of competition for 
student patronage have been abolished. 
Progress in eliminating the defects in the dental educational system 
has been comparatively slow, and it was necessarily so in the earlier 
history of the movement, for the reform lacked the stimulus and 
support of an educated and intelligent professional sentiment in its 
favor. With the general recognition, both by the public at large 
and by the dental profession itself of the serious importance of 
dental practice in its relation to individual and public health, the 
demand for more efficiently equipped dental practitioners has become 
continually more insistent. In response to the general demand the 
standards of dental education are progressively improving and the 
scope and character of the education of the dental practitioner is 
constantly enlarging to a degree which is in general accordance 
with the advance in educational activity in all departments of 
human interest. 
TWO LINES OF DEVELOPMENT. 
As previously stated, dental education has developed along two 
distinct, lines, having their origin in two equally different concep- 
tions as to the character of education best adapted to developing 
efficiency. The first conception is that dentistry is a special depart- 
ment of the science and art of healing, and therefore that the proper 
curriculum for the education of the dentist should include the medical 
curriculum leading to the medical degree, and, in addition, the special 
training necessary to fit the practitioner for the performance of the 
the operations characteristic~of dental practice. And the other, 
while recognizing that dentistry is a special department of the science 
and art of healing, would eliminate from the dental curriculum so 
much of the medical as is not specifically required in dental practice, 
and would substitute therefor an adequate training in those special 
departments which are necessary to and characteristic of dental 
practice. 
Practical recognition of the first-described system is exemplified 
in the statute recently enacted in the State of Virginia, which requires 
that all practitioners of dentistry in that State shall hereafter be 
holders of the medical degree. No other State of the United States 
has yet made the attainment of the medical degree a prerequisite for 
the practice of dentistry. Reliable statistics are not available for 
determining the number of dental practitioners in the United States 
who are holders of the medical degree. Still less is it possible to deter- 
mine the number who have taken the medical qualification for the 
definite purpose of improving their efficiency as dental practition- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
DENTAL EDUCATION. 61 
ers, but their. number is quite small in proportion to the large body 
of dentists whose qualification is represented exclusively by the 
degree which marks the successful completion of the specialized 
standard course of dental training. 
RELATIONS WITH MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES. 
Classified with respect to medical affiliations, seven dental schools 
are departments of medical schools, and the other dental colleges are 
conducting their educational work upon the ideal that efficiency in 
the dental practitioner is best obtained through a specialized cur- 
riculum, as set forth in the foregoing second classification. 
In the analysis of this second and major group of 46 American 
dental schools it is interesting to note that 27, or more than one-half 
of the total number, are allied with universities, either as an integral 
part of the university system or having at least a quasi university 
relationship, leaving 19 other schools which are avowedly private 
and independent corporations. 
In 1867 recognition was given to the specialized educational curric- 
ulum by the founding of the Harvard Dental School as a recognized 
department of Harvard University. As evidence of its recognition 
of that principle, Harvard University created a distinctive degree of 
Dentarizw Medicine Doctor. The educational ideal involved in the 
creation of its special degree is clearly set forth in the words of Dr. 
Charles W. Eliot, then president of Harvard University, in an address 
delivered before the American Academy of Dental Science held in 
Boston, October 30, 1878: 
Unlike degrees in arts, which merely indicate a certain amount of liberal study, no 
matter in what subjects, professional degrees should plainly declare the precise sort 
of training for which they stand. Since the training of a dentist upon a three years’ 
course of study is in good measure different from that of the physician or surgeon, it 
may well culminate in a special dental degree easily distinguished from the degree 
in medicine; just as the difference between the training of the civil engineer and 
the mining engineer is wisely marked by the use of two degrees which indicate that 
the trainings for these scientific professions are in good part diverse, though also in 
good part common.   
    
    
He says further, in reference to the unfitness of the medical degree 
as a mark of dental qualification: 
Moreover, the community will have no certain evidence that the dentist who 
holds the diploma of doctor of medicine and not that of doctor of dental surgery or 
medicine has ever pursued any dental subjects at all. 
The precedent thus established by Harvard University was fol- 
lowed by the University of Michigan in 1875, the University of Penn- 
sylvania in 1878, and by other universities from time to time. 
Two important results have been the outcome of the placing of 
dental education under the fostering care of seats of higher learning— 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the first being the practical recognition by the educational autkori- 
ties of America of the soundness of the doctrine that the educational 
training of the dentist should be specialized training; the second, the 
stimulus which the university relationship has given to the develop- 
ment of dentistry along higher educational lines. This stimulus has 
tended toward the larger development of dentistry simply as a natu- 
ral result of contact with the academic atmosphere and the progres- 
sive spirit characteristic of a seat of higher learning. An equally 
potent stimulating influence has been that of the economic factors 
involved. The centralization of teaching characteristic of the 
American university plan has made it possible to furnish a profes- 
sional education under the university system at less cost to the stu- 
dent than education of the same.character and grade can be furnished 
to him in a segregated professional school. Hence the unmistakable 
trend of all professional education is toward centralization under the 
university system, and the effect of university relationship upon 
dental education is quite analogous to that recognized in connection 
with education in law, medicine, and engineering. 
THE STANDARD CURRICULUM. 
The standard curriculum in all American dental schools consists 
of three annual sessions, in separate years, extending from on or 
about October 1 until the middle of the following June. Embraced 
in the curriculum is thorough training in practically all of the ele- 
mentary scientific subjects which are the groundwork of the standard 
medical curriculum, embracing anatomy and its subdivisions of oste- 
ology and histology, chemistry, bacteriology, physiology, and pathol- 
ogy, all with appropriate laboratory instruction. In addition are 
those subjects which are specially required for the training of the 
dentist, including operative and prosthetic dentistry and their subdi- 
visions, together with the necessary laboratory training and the clinical 
practice needed to give the student not only the intellectual compre- 
hension, but the practical manual facility to utilize his knowledge for 
the needs of efficient practice. Upon the elementary training in 
anatomy, physiology, and pathology is superimposed a training in 
the special application of these branches of medical science to the 
treatment of diseased conditions of the mouth andits organs, and in 
the structures adjacent thereto. 
ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS. 
The preliminary educational qualification requisite for admission 
to the course is satisfactory completion of a standard four years’ 
high-school course, or its equivalent as determined by examination. 
This standard logically articulates the termination of the public- 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
DENTAL EDUCATION. 63 
school educational system with the beginning of the professional 
course of instruction in dentistry. 
The activities in the direction of higher educational development, 
notwithstanding the extent to which postgraduate instruction is en- 
deavoring to meet the demand for additional training, are making it 
more and more evident that the present curriculum of three years is 
insufficient in point .of time for equipping the prospective dental prac- 
titioner as thoroughly and as efficiently as he should be equipped in, 
order to meet the demands upon his professional resources. The 
necessity for lengthening the curriculum of dental study by the ad- 
dition of one more year is broadly recognized among dental educa- 
tors, and it can scarcely be doubted that, with the increasing necessity 
for a larger training resulting on the one hand from the general 
increase of data constituting the basis of dental knowledge, and on 
the other the increasing demand for advanced instruction, the stand- 
ard curriculum in dentistry must in the very near future be increased 
to four years, so as to equal in duration the present standard medical 
curriculum. 
INFLUENCE OF MOUTH DISORDERS UPON GENERAL HEALTH. 
Comparatively recent developments which have been the out- 
growth of scientific research in connection with pathological con- 
ditions arising within the mouth and the relationships of these dis- 
orders to bodily health have served to focus attention, not only of the 
dental profession, but of the medical profession and of those who are 
concerned with the problems of sanitation and of public health, upon 
the importance of the mouth cavity as the source of many conditions 
which more or less seriously affect the general health of the individual. 
The enormous importance of mouth diseases in connection with public 
health has aroused attention in all civilized countries, with the result, 
among other things, that the demand for expert knowledge wherewith 
to combat this source of ill health and disease has had a marked effect 
in enlarging the scope of the curriculum through which the pro- 
spective dental practitioner must pass before he can be considered 
competent to deal with the problems confronting him. 
POSTGRADUATE STUDY AND RESEARCH. 
The demand for more thorough training of the dentist, both in his 
relation to private practice and in connection with public-health 
service, arises not only from sources outside of the dental profession 
but within the dental profession itself. Among the most evident 
manifestations of the pronounced interest in higher dental education 
is the demand for postgraduate study upon the part of members of the 
dental profession already in practice. In the response to this demand 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
nearly all the dental colleges are offering graduate courses open to 
practitioners and are furnishing instruction to special graduate 
elasses in all of the more recent developments of dental art and 
science. 
A further manifestation of the same impulse is the creation of a 
research commission, under the auspices of the National Dental Asso- 
ciation of America, having for its object the promotion of research in 
matters pertaining to dentistry. The committee on the scientific 
foundation fund has collected from the dental profession about 
$25,000, and has instituted active work in several important direc- 
tions of scientific research which have already produced valuable 
results. An important and encouraging feature of this movement is 
the widespread and practical interest which its purposes have aroused 
throughout the dental profession of America. Not only is the fund 
itself rapidly increasing in amount, but the movement has aroused 
such a degree of enthusiasm that there is every reasonable prospect 
that the work of the commission will be made secure and permanent 
upon a sound financial basis. The present purpose of the trustees of 
_the fund is to stimulate a general interest in dental scientific research 
work, and to promote work by dental investigators connected with 
educational institutions by providing them with the financial sup- 
port. 
THE FORSYTH DENTAL INFIRMARY. 
Among other developments which have been the outgrowth of the 
larger educational training both of the dental profession and the 
public in connection with mouth hygiene in its relation to bodily 
health has been the creation of the Forsyth Dental Infirmary in 
Boston through the liberality and broadmindedness of John Hamil- 
ton and Thomas Alexander Forsyth as a memorial to their brothers, 
James Bennett and George Henry Forsyth. The institution was 
incorporated in Boston in 1910. The building and the land upon 
which it stands, together with an endowment of about $1,000,000 to 
provide for maintenance of the institution, represent a gift of about 
$2,000,000. The purpose of the Forsyth Dental Infirmary is to 
furnish free dental service to all of the public-school children of Boston 
under the age of 16 years, and in addition it is proposed to utilize the 
institution for practical teaching in oral hygiene and to carry on 
scientific research, particularly with reference to the relationship 
which mouth infection, malpositions of the teeth, and deformities of 
the dental arches bear to general disease causation. The institution, 
besides its public-service work in oral hygiene, will exert an educa- 
tional influence through the medium of public lectures on matters 
relating to the care of the mouth and the relation of oral hygiene to

        DENTAL EDUCATION. 65 
bodily health. The building is-almost completed, and it is expected 
that it will be ready for dedication early in the present year. 
SCHOOL DENTAL CLINICS, 
Other notable expressions of the same general impulse are the 
creation of public school dental clinics in nearly all of the large 
centers of population and the appointment of dental practitioners 
to the staffs of various hospitals throughout the country aid-upon 
municipal and State health boards. It is evident that both the 
public and the dental profession are keenly alive to the important 
causal relation which mouth infection and mouth disorders bear to 
many phases of bodily ill health. 
DENTAL NURSES. 
As a logical outgrowth of the general activity with reference to 
hygienic care of the mouth, a movement has been activély in 
progress during the past year for the training of capable young women 
for a professional activity in connection with oral hygiene somewhat 
analogous to that of the trained medical or surgical nurse. These 
dental nurses are trained to act as assistants to dental practitioners 
and in hospital service, and to be capable of giving intelligent cleans- 
ing surface treatment to patients having infected accumulations upon 
the teeth. 
In some States, notably Massachusetts, the legislature has had 
under consideration the passage of an act for legalizing the status of 
the so-called dental nurse and issuing to her a license, after ascer- 
taining by examination that she is properly qualified for her duties. 
The legislative aspect of the dental-nurse question is still undeter- 
mined, but provision has already been made in Bridgeport, Conn., 
by a competent faculty under the direction of Dr. Alfred C. Fones, 
for the systematic and adequate training of professional dental 
nurses, and the movement seems destined to become an educational 
fixture. 
THE EVANS MUSEUM AND INSTITUTE. 
       
              
        
    Among the later developments in dental educational activities is 
the founding of the Thomas W. Evans Museum and Dental Institute 
in Philadelphia, under the bequest of the late Dr. Thomas W. Evans, 
of Paris, the residue of whose estate, amounting to upward of $1,500,- 
000 has been devoted to that purpose. By agreement between the 
trustees of the institute and of the University of Pennsylvania, a 
cooperative affiliation has been effected by which the dental school 
of the University of Pennsylvania will occupy the institute building, 
and its faculty will conduct the educational work of the institute. 
17726°—xEp 1913—vor 1——5
-P-A-G-E-120
   
   66 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
In recognition of the three well-marked divisions of activity now 
recognized as factors in dental education, provision in the educa- 
tional scheme of the institute is made for undergraduate instruction 
leading to the dental qualification, for postgraduate instruction, and 
for original scientific research work in matters pertaining to den- 
tistry. The institute building will be the largest structure in the 
world exclusively devoted to dental instruction, and it will be ready 
for occupation during the present year. The educational motif of 
the institute is thoroughly to equip the student for the efficient 
practice of dentistry, not only from its local and manipulative stand- 
point, but from the broader constitutional aspects involved in the 
close anatomical and physiological relations which the mouth and 
teeth bear to the whole body. 
CONCLUSION. 
A survey of the entire field of dental activity and development, 
especially during the year just past, strongly indicates that dentistry 
has achieved a position of importance both in the mind of its practi- 
tioners and of the public at large which places its educational stand- 
ards and professional activities quite on a par with those of any other 
specialty of the general science and art of healing.

      NUMERICAL INCREASE GREATEST IN VILLAGES. 
The rapid numerical growth which has characterized the secondary 
schools of the United States for the past two decades continues with- 
out interruption. The facts which have frequently been summarized 
in these reports show that during the decade immediately preceding 
1900-1901 the number of secondary schools, including both private 
and public, increased nearly 100 per cent and the number of students 
increased in a somewhat higher ratio. In the decade from 1900-1901 
to 1910-11 the number of schools increased from 8,210 to 12,213 and 
the number of students increased from 649,951 to 1,115,326. At the 
end of the year 1911-12 there were 18,268 schools and 1,246,827 
students. 
In an analysis of the attendance statistics made by W. J. Fisher 
(Science, N. S. 36: 587-590, Nov. 1, 1912) it is shown that in recent 
years this growth has been most pronounced in the small country or 
township high schools. The larger centers of population throughout 
the country have for some years been supplied with high schools. 
Changes in the urban schools are going forward in the character of 
the courses of study and in the general equipment and to some extent 
in the enrollment, but the changes in urban schools are not so con- 
spicuous numerically as the aggregate changes which are taking place 
67   
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  68 EDUCATION REPORT; 1913. 
in rural and village districts. Where communities have hesitated in 
the past to assume the expense of organizing secondary schools, ways 
and means are now being found of opening such schools. In some 
cases, in order to get the funds for a high school, new educational 
administrative units have been created. These new units can raise 
more funds because they are larger and because the problem of taxing 
for high schools can be freed from the problem of raising money for 
elementary schools. There are certain disadvantages which arise 
from a separate organization of elementary and secondary education 
in the same region, but the separation is regarded as on the whole 
better than the absence of public secondary schools would be. In 
time the organization will improve and the two schools will doubtless 
be brought together again. A second method of enlarging the op- 
portunities of secondary education offered to rural or village students 
is through the payment of tuition of such students in neighboring 
high schools, either by the central State educational authorities or by 
the local authorities. In some cases this payment of tuition is sup- 
plemented by payment in part or in full of transportation expenses. 
A third somewhat different form of support for high schools exists in 
some States where the central State department makes appropriations 
to support schools, especially those which carry on special courses, 
such as agriculture. Serious discussion has of late been given to the 
problem of extending this governmental support to high schools by 
providing Federal funds for special agricultural and industrial 
schools. The net result of all of these different provisions is that the 
opportunity of a free secondary education is now offered to the great 
majority of the youth of the country. 
The internal numerical increase in high schools is no more remark- 
able than the change in public sentiment which is recorded in this 
universal public support of secondary education. Two decades ago 
the question was very commonly raised whether the public purse 
might properly be charged with the cost of secondary education. 
To-day there is a public sentiment so strong that free high schools 
are provided everywhere. 
A contributing cause to the growth of secondary schools in rural 
and village districts is the realization that the course of study may 
properly include a great variety of subjects. Thus it has been 
pointed out above that liberal grants are often made from State 
departments to agricultural education. In Bulletin 1913, No. 6 
(Whole Number 513) issued by the Bureau of Education, Messrs. 
Robison and Jenks have shown the range and importance of agri- 
cultural instruction in high schools. Other changes in the course of 
study, all tending to give the student a broader opportunity to study 
practical subjects, have fostered the growth of high schools and have 
encouraged a larger attendance of students.
-P-A-G-E-123
THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, 69 
In this connection it is important that attention be drawn to the 
conservatism of certain communities, as shown by the analysis made 
by Mr. Fisher in the paper to which reference is made above. .The 
high schools located in those States which are less advanced educa- 
tionally are more likely to hold to the traditional subjects of instrue- 
tion than are the schools in more progressive States. There is 
evidence in this fact that a community which opens a high school likes 
to think of the new institution as patterned closely on lines of. the 
traditional high school. There is accordingly a disposition to de- 
mand that algebra and Latin be taught and that the approval.of 
some college be sought, whether the organization that results is the 
most advantageous organization or not. Communities afflicted with 
this type of conservatism should be encouraged to read the report 
of a country school which changed its program radically in the 
effort to adjust. itself to local needs (Bulletin 1912, No. 20; Read- 
justment of a Rural High School to the Needs of the Community, 
H. A. Brown.) 
RELATIVE POSITION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS, 
The growth of public secondary schools led during the past decade 
to the abandonment of many private and endowed schools which 
had been centers of secondary education, There is evidence that 
a new era of private-school development is at hand. <A private 
school is often more at liberty than a public school to make radical 
experiments and to emphasize certain special forms of training. 
Thus a military academy, especially if it is a boarding school, takes 
a responsibility for its students which no public institution could 
assume. On the other hand, a school which emphasizes relaxation 
of all formal school regulations and extreme forms of student goy- 
ernment, as does the Interlaken School, assumes a responsibility 
which a public school would be reluctant to assume, For reasons 
of the type intimated in these examples, private schools are in some 
cases largely attended. The difficulty of securing accurate informa- 
tion regarding such institutions makes it impossible to assert with 
assurance how far these schools are flourishing. From the volumi- 
nous announcements of such schools which fill the advertising pages 
of some of the popular magazines and of the newspapers which 
make a specialty of such announcements, it seems that there is an 
increase in the number of private schools. Such an increase is also 
doubtless aided by the growth of wealth among patrons who desire 
for their children either more exclusive associations or closer per- 
sonal supervision.

  70 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
GROWING INDEPENDENCE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The numerical growth of the secondary schools has been accom- 
panied by a development of administrative independence which is 
expressing itself more and more clearly. During the current year 
the Bureau of Education issued two bulletins (Bulletin, 1913, No. 7, 
Whole No, 510, College Entrance Requirements, C. D. Kingsley; and 
Bulletin, 1913, No. 29, Whole No. 539, Accredited Secondary Schools 
in the United States, K. C. Babcock) which show how far the high 
schools of the country have gone in freeing themselves from the 
domination of colleges. The first of the bulletins to which reference 
has been made shows that the colleges have recognized the inde- 
pendence of the high school to a degree which would have been 
unthinkable two generations or even one generation ago. There are 
a great many subjects now accepted by colleges which were not com- 
mon in high-school programs 10 years ago, such as commercial courses, 
domestic science, and music; and there is a relaxation of traditional 
requirements, so that students may now enter many first-class insti- 
tutions with only one foreign language, and may enter some without 
any. Indeed, a number of colleges have reached the point where they 
explicitly leave the problem of organizing the secondary course to the 
secondary schools. 
Nowhere are the evidences of growing independence of the high 
school more evident than in the changes in entrance requirements 
reluctantly accepted by the small group of great eastern colleges, 
which have long admitted by examination only and have further 
insisted that the student take the strait and narrow gate of their 
own conservative requirements. Harvard made a change some years” 
ago, because, as President Lowell frankly announced, Harvard found 
herself getting out of touch with the great western high schools. 
These western high schools receive from the colleges about them a 
kind of recognition which eastern high schools have been slow to 
demand as their right. It is not surprising, therefore, that the west- 
ern schools should first show the marks of independence in their 
organization of courses. After Harvard came Yale and Princeton 
with changes in their plans of admission which recognize somewhat 
more tardily than Harvard a high degree of autonomy on the part 
of feeding schools. 
In the second of the two bulletins to which reference is made above 
one finds not only the long list of names of secondary schools 
approved by State departments and by other accrediting agencies, 
but also evidences of the development of organizations which are 
playing a large part in the current development of secondary schools. 
The colleges served one very salutary purpose in the days when they 
dominated the preparatory schools—they kept these schools con-
-P-A-G-E-125
THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 71 
stantly aware of the necessity of organizing the student’s course of 
study toward a definite end. With the appearance in the schools of 
many students who did not intend to go to college, this method of 
securing a definition of the student’s course became obsolete. 
NEW AGENCIES FOR CONTROLLING SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
In the past few years, during which the control of the colleges has 
been breaking down, there has been a good deal of uncertainty as to 
where the high schools were drifting. There arose thus the need of 
some definite agency to organize secondary schools along new lines. 
The units of control must of necessity be larger than the single school. 
It is too obvious to the observer of schools that the organization of 
the single school is in great danger of sudden and violent changes. 
The faculty is transient and the central control is often too weak 
to organize and carry out far-reaching educational policies. For 
these reasons it is of the highest importance in the history of sec- 
ondary education that there is a well-developed tendency for strong 
agencies to take control of the high schools. These agencies are of 
two types: First, voluntary associations, which usually include both 
colleges and secondary schools; and, second, State departments. 
The voluntary associations have many elements of weakness. They 
usually depend on institutions for such inspections as they are able to 
make, and their authority is limited. Thus Dr. Babcock’s list shows 
that in the territory of the North Central Association of Colleges 
and Secondary Schools each of the colleges in the association accepts 
students from a great many schools below the standards of the asso- 
ciation. On the other hand, the voluntary association has elements 
of strength. Since its standards originate from within, the associa- 
tion has great influence in spreading respect for high standards and, 
since each of these associations covers a number of States, the stand- 
ards of the association are likely to be higher than those of any single 
State. In this sense it is well that there should be a broad, general, 
voluntary association. : 
The development of State control of secondary education is in 
most States new and will undoubtedly pass through experimental 
stages. New York, which has exercised this control through an 
examination system, does not seem to be generally accepted as a 
satisfactory example. The States of the North Central section are 
developing various forms of inspection. Some of these States are 
experimenting with State prescription of textbooks and State courses 
of study: Several States are giving influence to their State depart- 
ments by putting them in charge of State funds to be disbursed to the 
high schools. 
Tt will be pointed out later, in discussing the supply of secondary 
teachers, that the State universities are exercising a very large in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
  
    
72 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
fluence in the organization of secondary schools.’ In some States 
there is a lack of complete coordination between the work of the State 
department and that of the university. inspector. This incoordina- 
tion is a temporary symptom of incomplete development of the 
system. : 
THE ENTIRE CURRICULUM UNDER EXAMINATION. 
' The development of new agencies for the control of secondary 
edueation,; which agencies are to replace the older college entrance 
requirements as the dominant influence in the organization of high 
schools, brings to light a series of problems which were little dis- 
cussed in the last decade. One hardly ventured 10 years ago to ask 
why so much algebra should be taught in high school. Of course 
algebra was to be taught, and its quantity was determined by the 
college requirements. Now, not only does the question. come up, but 
it confronts a group of high-school officers who are beginning to 
realize that emancipation from the control of colleges brings to the 
high school new and grave responsibilities. The high school must 
now organize itself from within. It must find adequate methods of 
testing its work. It must relate itself intelligently to the institutions 
above and below its own sphere of operations, and it must direct its 
students in accordance with rational and definable principles. The 
result is that a new series of high-school problems is now recognized 
by high-school teachers, voluntary associations, and State depart- 
ments, A brief statement of several of these problems will serve 
both to define the present work of high schools and to show the direc- 
tion in which organization within these schools is moving. 
The first of these discussions relates to what may be called the 
range of secondary education. The secondary school can not accept 
a position between the elementary school and the college without con- 
sidering seriously the question whether the upper and the lower limits 
of its domain have been rationally set. There is a growing conviction 
that neither the lower nor the upper boundary of the secondary school 
is in accordance with the best interests of students. The last two 
years of the elementary school are, in point of students’ interests, in 
point of organization of classes and mode of instruction, more like 
high school than like the other grades of the elementary school. Why 
not take over the last two years of the elementary school into the 
high school? : 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS GROW IN FAYOR. 
In answer to this question a number of school systems have organ- 
ized junior high schools. Such schools may be defended as satisfy- 
ing specifically one of three desires. Often it is desired that students 
who have completed the sixth grade shall have an early opportunity 
to begin the subjects conventionally taken up in the high school.
-P-A-G-E-127
  
THE STATUS .OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 73 
Thus, instead of postponing the study of Latin or algebra until the 
student is 14, he is given the opportunity of taking up one or more of 
these studies when he is 12. A second reason for organizing a junior 
high school may be to give the student an opportunity to take ad. 
vanced subjects, not of the conventional type, but of a type not 
usually admitted into the curriculum of the elementary school, Thus, 
if the two-year junior high-school course is offered to students who do 
not intend to take the full high-school course, it gives them some 
introduction to civics or to mechanics, subjects which would ordi+ 
narily be closed to them until the secondary course. Third, there is 
the motive of differentiation of the course in order to fit the needs of 
different students. The student who is going into business should 
pursue during his thirteenth and fourteenth years subjects other 
than those which are advantageous to the student who intends’ to 
enter a profession. In most cases these three motives are not dis- 
tinct, but each contributes to a general feeling of dissatisfaction with 
the present organization and supports the demand fornia spread of 
the junior high-school idea. 
The present organization of an eight-year elementary school, fol- 
lowed by a four-year high school, is purely traditional. Tt can not; 
be justified as adapted to the needs of children if by elementary 
course is meant a series of years of instruction common to all chil- 
dren in the community. Thus there can be no doubt that in much 
of the current discussion of vocational and prevocational education 
there is ambiguity at just this point. Many of those who discuss 
the problem of a differentiation of the school course state that the 
problem is one of secondary education. They mean by this that there 
is a certain general elementary training which is universally required 
and should precede differentiated, specifically vocational training. 
When they describe specialized training as secondary in type, they 
do not mean to use “secondary” as synonymous with the present 
ordinary high-school course; they mean rather to use the term “ sec- 
ondary ” in a broader sense, indeed in a sense very closely related 
to that in which it is used in those centers which have organized 
junior high schools. The increase in number of such junior centers 
is therefore an expression of the conviction that a new definition is 
required of the lower boundary of secondary schools. 
In several centers a movement has begun which undoubtedly will 
increase in importance. In these centers schools have been opened 
which are not higher than the elementary school in the ordinary 
sense; that is, in progression of courses or intellectual difficulty of 
the courses. Such schools accept. students who have become dis- 
couraged with elementary work, or show unfitness for ordinary grad- 
ing with elementary pupils, because of age. These children, who 
would naturally leave school if no course were open to them except 
   
-P-A-G-E-128
  14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the usual secondary course, can be further instructed profitably for 
a period of years. The instruction offered them is usually training 
in the manual arts, but it may be coupled with a certain amount of 
review work, or specially prepared reading, science, and number 
work. Schools of this type have been organized in Scotland under 
the title Supplementary Classes, and their rise in American cities 
may serve to simplify greatly the problem of relating secondary and 
elementary schools by adding to the possibilities offered students an 
educational opportunity that is neither elementary in the regular 
sense, nor yet a part of the general progressive plan of education as 
usually conceived. 
HIGH SCHOOLS ARE ASSUMING COLLEGE WORK ALSO. 
The enlargements of the secondary school thus far discussed are 
downward into the domain of the elementary school. No less con- 
spicuous is the tendency of the high school to take on work which 
has commonly been classified as college work. It has frequently 
been pointed out that there is much overlapping of courses between 
the high school and the college. Every college offers elementary 
. courses in modern language, science, history, and in the classics, 
which overlap the courses offered in high schools. In many parts 
of the country where secondary schools are not fully developed, 
rivalry between colleges and these schools becomes so keen that it 
has been necessary for State inspectors to adopt drastic measures in 
order to draw attention to the extent to which the colleges are de- 
voting themselves to secondary work. One of the most courageous 
reports of the year is that of Mr. Hand, of South Carolina, who gives 
the names of colleges which are competing unfairly with high schools. 
He gives details in each case, so that the community will be able 
to judge for itself the extent to which education is impeded by selfish 
private competition. Furthermore, he points out the mistake which 
is made by individual citizens in withdrawing their children from 
the local secondary school and sending them to some so-called col- 
lege, thereby discouraging and crippling the secondary school and 
supporting the unworthy college. It is not alone in quarters where 
competition is keen, however, that. the failure of high schools and 
colleges to define themselves has led to disastrous results. There are 
very few colleges in which it is not true that the effort to carry 
an enormous burden of elementary work is curtailing the institution’s 
ability to support adequately more advanced courses. One of the 
gravest problems confronting the great State universities to-day is 
the problem of taking care of this condition. It was recently re- 
ported that the records of a number of graduates of a great college 
showed that half the courses taken by most of the students were ele-
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 15 
mentary courses. These facts show how urgent is the need for a 
better definition of the upper limits of secondary education. 
Finally, a new fact presents itself in the large and ever-increasing 
equipment of the modern high school. In many urban centers the 
high school has more material resources than the neighboring small 
college. The result is that there is a natural tendency for the high 
school to push its work, through elective courses and through post- 
graduate work, into the sphere formerly occupied by the colleges. 
The organization of freshmen and sophomore college courses in 
many centers seems a logical development of the public educational 
system in the United States. The experiment in Wisconsin to satisfy 
the public demand for more centers for the early years of college 
training through the organization of freshmen and sophomore college 
work in each of the State normal schools seems of doubtful wisdom, 
since it will tend to subdivide the already inadequate facilities. for 
the training of teachers. The State of California has sanctioned by 
statute the organization of junior college work in high schools. High 
schools in other parts of the country have also taken steps in the 
same direction for one reason or another. The movement toward 
such advanced work is legitimate from every theoretical point of view 
and will undoubtedly go on until a better definition is reached of the 
line of division between what is essentially secondary in college edu- 
cation and what is sequent upon secondary training. 
TEACHER TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Reference may properly be made in this connection to a tendency 
which has shown itself in several States to draft the high schools into 
the public service of supplying teachers for the lower schools. There 
is no State in the Union which has normal schools enough to meet the 
annual demand for new teachers. It is natural, therefore, that State 
departments of education should look to the high schools for co- 
operation in the training of teachers. In some quarters the high 
school meets this demand by organizing special courses in methods 
and history of education and school law. These special courses 
either are made elective to senior students or are less commonly given 
as graduate courses. There can be-no doubt that this effort to supply 
more trained teachers for the lower schools is a legitimate and useful 
movement. How far it should go will depend upon the development 
of that altogether undefined institution, the normal school. It may 
safely be asserted that a one year’s course given as part of a high- 
school training or even a one year’s course added to the ordinary 
high-school course is inadequate for the training of teachers. The 
present use of the high school to satisfy this urgent need may there- 
fore be regarded as temporary. Some larger policy, which it is not 
primarily the business of the high school to work out, will have to be
-P-A-G-E-130
    
  76 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. - 
adopted by the State in order to supply the requisite number of 
teachers. 
NEW TYPES AND NEW METHODS. 
The high school of the future, it would appear from these con- 
siderations, is likely to include more than four years. It is likely to 
reach downward and take in the last years of the elementary school. 
It is likely to reach upward and take in the early years of the college 
and possibly of the normal school. Already the term “six-year high 
school” is familiar through discussions and experiments, and exten- 
sion in both directions is being tried. When the new type of organi- 
zation becomes more common, problems of greater economy of time 
will arise, and questions of the readjustment of courses, such as the 
earlier beginning of modern languages. In short, the high school as 
a center of educational reorganization will more and more take up 
educational problems in terms of its own judgments rather than as a 
subordinate of the colleges or a mere inessential addition to the 
elementary school. 
Growing directly out of these considerations relating to the range 
of secondary education, there are, in the second place, a series of cur- 
rent discussions relating to the courses of instruction. Secondary 
teachers have until recently given little attention to the problems of 
method and organization of courses. But a number of new publica- 
tions dealing with methods, addressed to high-school teachers and 
seriously considered by them, bear testimony to an awakening to 
pedagogical problems. A few typical examples of such discussions 
must suffice for this general review. 
SUPERVISED STUDY. 
There is much current discussion of the problem of class-room 
study as distinguished from home study on the one hand and from 
the examination type of recitation on the other. The conventional 
method of assigning lessons is to designate certain problems to be 
solved or to indicate a certain number of pages to be read and ab- 
sorbed. With this assignment the student is dismissed to do his 
studying by himself. At most a few comments on how the work 
should be done have sometimes been added to this assignment. The 
result is that the student in his efforts to prepare his lesson stumbles 
on a method of study which often is very clumsy. For example, if 
his problem is to look up the meaning of a foreign word, he very 
often adopts the most direct method, which is to find in a vocabulary 
the one particular meaning which fits the passage on which he is at 
work. It would be looking for more than is reasonable from an im- 
mature student to expect him to, understand the economy of analyzing 
the foreign word so that he will see its derivation or to understand
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. U7 
the economy of meanings, fundamental and derived, of the root with 
which he has to deal. If the student took a broad view of his task 
and spent the time necessary to prepare fully for future contact with 
the word, he would have to invest much time and energy which 
bring no immediate and obvious return. If the student is to adopt 
this longer and more laborious method of work, he must be super- 
vised. Some one who can see beyond immediate demands must lead 
him. Like arguments for supervised study can be found in every 
sphere of school work. It is, of course, not denied by enthusiastic ad- 
vocates of supervised study that many teachers have in times past 
used the recitation period as an opportunity for giving suggestions 
of the type described in the above example. But suggestions are not 
enough. The student must be watched, especially in the early stages 
of contact with a new subject, and habits of economical study must 
be thoroughly cultivated. 
Tn order that this more complete attention to supervised study 
may be possible, various modifications of the high-school program are 
being tried. Thus lengthened recitation periods are assigned to one 
or more subjects with the understanding that the mode of procedure 
will be radically changed and much class study will be carried on. 
For example, the experiment is made of double periods in. the alge- 
bra classes of at least one high school. Algebra has long been recog- 
nized as a source of very heavy failure on the part of high-school 
students. These failures have been referred in some cases to a sup- 
posed natural incapacity of certain students for mathematical types 
of thought. When a failing student is carefully studied, however, it 
is found that his difficulty arises out of his inability to attack the 
problem. He does not know the terms in which the problem is stated; 
he does not know the elementary methods of algebraical manipula- 
tion. The class in the meantime is “going through” the book, and 
the student gets hopelessly behind. The experiment in supervised 
study is an effort to correct the difficulties which have thus arisen in 
the past. The instructor is with the student when he attacks the 
problem. Difficulties are taken up together. There is no formal 
getting of answers, but there is a genuine attack on problems. 
Another device adopted in one high school is to set aside one period 
each day as a period of study under supervision as distinguished 
from recitation work. In order that each subject taught in the school 
may profit by this study period a weekly rotation is established, so 
that the classes which recite the first period in the morning have the 
exclusive right to the study period on Mondays, the classes which re- 
cite the second period in the morning have the study period on 
Tuesdays, and so on. In still other cases teachers are directed to 
use the regular recitation periods for study, as distinguished from 
recitation, as often as they see fit. It has sometimes appeared under
-P-A-G-E-132
  18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
this plan that the early part of a course should be differently or- 
ganized from the later part. Thus in the study of a foreign language 
it has been found by some instructors advantageous to do all the early 
work in the form of supervised study, making no assignments for 
private study. In other cases, as in science courses, there are exer- 
cises distributed throughout the course which, because of the novelty 
_ of their methods, call for intimate supervision. 
The effect of all these experiments on home work has been various 
in different schools. In some cases home assignments have been 
reduced ; in a few cases they have been abandoned altogether. A gen- 
eral report of this kind is hardly the appropriate place for a full dis- 
cussion of the problem of home study. It may be recorded, however, 
as the experience of some who have dealt with this problem, that 
unless students are given some definite tasks which they must work 
out by themselves they fail to develop independence in attention and 
in attack upon intellectual problems. 
The importance of this movement toward the cultivation of super- 
vised study can hardly be exaggerated in summarizing current dis- 
cussions of secondary education. The reports of those who have 
made the experiments are, of course, colored by the fact that the 
experimenters are in most cases enthusiasts; but if the effects of super- 
vised study continue to show the favorable results which up to this 
time have been universal, there can be no doubt that a great change 
will be wrought in the methods of secondary teaching. At the pres- 
ent time there is no large body of information to which the teacher 
may turn. How one should learn his mathematics or his Latin or his 
science is a relatively unsolved psychological and practical problem. 
The movement of supervising study will depend for its success, 
therefore, upon the cultivation and distribution of a relatively new 
type of knowledge. The science teacher will have to learn how to 
help the student to learn to draw and how to help the student to use 
a laboratory exercise for purposes other than the training of memory. 
High-school teachers will have to learn how to help students to select 
the items of knowledge which need to be memorized and how to help 
students to memorize these items economically and thoroughly. All 
this involves a broad pedagogical view which has for the most part 
been absent in high schools. 
Before leaving the problem of supervised study, one other phase 
of the matter which has been much emphasized in recent popular dis- 
cussions may be mentioned. The difficulty of home study is increased 
from the student’s point of view by the fact that there is usually very 
little team play in the faculty in assigning home lessons. By a coin- 
cidence that seems to recur with fatal regularity, several members of 
the faculty choose the same night for an extra assignment. The 
conflicting motives which guide a student’s choice of the lesson which
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, 19 
he will first attack under these circumstances would constitute a fruit- 
ful subject for psychological study. The only remedy for this diffi- 
culty is for the instructors to arrange in faculty conferences the whole 
outside program of requirements. Indeed, devices are needed for 
measuring in some more adequate way even the ordinary assignments. 
Certainly, if extra assignments are to be made, they should be 
arranged and sanctioned by the faculty as a whole. 
COORDINATION SHOULD ACCOMPANY EXPANSION. 
A third general topic of interest is one that has been forced upon 
the attention of both teachers and students because of the complexity 
of the curriculum offered in high schools. The problem may be 
stated as the problem of coordinating and at the same time differen- 
tiating high-school courses. There are to-day small high schools with 
two or three teachers which can offer only a limited number of courses 
of instruction. When one visits such a small school he is, however, 
more likely to be astonished at the ambitious variety of courses offered 
than at the meagerness of the program. The small teaching staff, 
wishing to have a high school of the most modern type, offers a long 
series of courses in languages, mathematics, history, and science. 
Whatever limitations there are in the variety of subjects offered in 
a small high school, limits are removed in the larger institutions. 
Elective possibilities are here so wide in range that the student is 
confused and is always in need of guidance. The plea which was 
justly made a generation ago that the high-school course needed 
broadening has been met by an enormous development of the sec- 
ondary curriculum. Indeed, there are those who would advocate a 
return to the old restricted and fully prescribed course as a remedy 
for the evils which an elaborate elective curriculum has engendered. 
Here and there in the country one can find a conscientious school 
board and a zealous principal operating on the belief that the 
virtues of the last generation arose out of the limitations set upon 
their course. It is safe to prophesy that these reactionists will never 
attract very much of a following. Yet the problem which their 
protest points out is a real one, and some bounds must be set upon 
the freedom with which the high-school student may ramble among 
elective courses. 
The direction in which true relief from the difficulties of the 
situation is to be sought is indicated by the effort of various high- 
school faculties to outline coherent groups of courses. The student 
who is to take physics certainly ought to take geometry and algebra 
and ought to take some other science courses. The student who 
studies Latin certainly ought to take cognate courses in history and 
other literatures. While these two examples of sequences might be
-P-A-G-E-134
  80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
accepted by most teachers as rational, we are plunged at once by such 
concrete efforts to make sequences into the midst of discussions which 
are carried on in every association of high-school teachers, and, often 
without generally accepted conclusions, in many faculties, 
COORDINATION LACKING IN SCIENCE AND IN LANGUAGE. 
Possibly a detailed statement of our case may serve to emphasize 
the difficulties which beset all departments when they begin to or- 
ganize themselves. The sciences are, more than other subjects in 
the high-school course, scattered and dissociated. The student takes 
a short course in botany or in physiography and then seeks to go 
on with.science. He finds that the elective offered next year is 
physics. He is told by students who have taken physics that it is 
not at all related to the first science course which he has completed. 
He is at,a loss to know what he should do. Hardly less is the 
teacher at a loss. Should physical sciences precede biological or 
follow? Should chemistry be given, or should it be left for college? 
Foreign educators who visit our schools are astonished to find that 
we have, no ‘well-organized chemistry courses open to secondary 
students. All over Europe chemistry is recognized as of such great 
importance to industry that long series of systematic courses in 
chemistry and the practical arts dependent on chemistry are organ- 
ized for relatively young students. High schools in the United 
States seem to proceed on the psychological ground that the observa- 
tion of a chemical reaction is difficult because it is usually indirect, 
and as a result there is little chemistry given. All these cases show 
how fragmentary is the science instruction in high schools. Con- 
trasted with Latin or German or with mathematics, in each of which 
fields of instruction the sequence is obvious, science struggles on, 
comparatively unable to take its place in the high-school curriculum. 
We note, therefore, the phenomenon of a decline in the ratio of 
students who elect science. This decline is doubtless due in part 
.to methods of administering the individual sciences, but beyond these 
particular difficulties unquestionably looms large the lack of coher- 
ent organization of the high-school science curriculum. 
The difficulties which exist in the science departments are paralleled 
in the department of English. There is no established practice with 
regard to the relative emphasis on composition and the study of 
literature. Within a given department there is great disparity of 
practice in teaching two divisions of the same class. .One of the 
most hopeful indications that the high-school course in English is to 
be better organized appears in the rise of a strong organization of 
English teachers. The National Council of English: Teachers has 
at least recognized its problem and has set about trying to solve it. 
   
-P-A-G-E-135
THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 81 
The papers presented at the meetings of this organization illustrate 
the general movement toward better organization of the curriculum 
in high schools. 
Out of the efforts to develop coherent groups of courses there have 
arisen a number of minor problems which should be mentioned. 
Thus it has been asked whether there can not be some more funda- 
mental interrelating of subjects. Language teachers are discovering 
that students have wasted an enormous amount of time because the 
grammatical terms employed in different language classes have been 
discordant. There are, these language teachers now tell us, a com- 
mon grammatical structure in all the languages, and a possibility of 
referring to the grammatical characteristics of each language in a 
single common terminology. Great economy in education will result 
from this alliance of language teachers. The mathematicians have 
for some time known why algebra and geometry are both announced 
in the same department, but until recently they have kept their 
secret from the high-school student. Now, thanks to the work of 
the International Commission and its committees, American teachers 
have been made aware of the discussions of methods of teaching 
their subjects which have been going on for years in France, Ger- 
many, and England, and there is a most vigorous interest manifested 
in the problem of working the mathematical course over so that 
first-year algebra shall not be the stumbling-block of the high-school 
curriculum and shall issue into geometry in a natural and truly 
mathematical way. The problem of organizing science has been 
referred to above. In this connection note may be made of the first- 
year general-science courses which are proposed and are being tried in 
several high schools as introductory courses, covering a wide range 
and variety of physical and biological problems. 
STUDY OF THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT IS ESSENTIAL. 
Administrative devices for securing coherency in the student’s 
curriculum are also becoming common. The school sets up certain 
groups of electives and insists more or less strenuously that the 
student shall follow the lines laid down in these groups. In other 
schools the students are advised, not by the printed sequences, but by 
the principal or some consulting teacher. In the larger schools the 
advisor system has come to be very common. Finally, a few schools 
have carried the organization of the student’s work far enough to 
raise the whole question of the student’s probable later vocation, and 
in the light of this information and a study of his present interests 
and attainments to build up a curriculum and also in the same spirit 
to organize all his outside activities.

82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
This most comprehensive interest in the student is undoubtedly the 
ideal toward which schools should aim. The organized course of 
study may mean, and undoubtedly does mean, some modification of 
the classroom instruction, but the course of study for any given 
student can never be fully and satisfactorily organized without a 
minute study of the student himself. 
The recognition of the student’s needs as the central problem of 
school organization has come to be such a common theme in current 
educational discussions that there is no need in such a report as this 
of discussing the theoretical aspects of the matter. It is appropriate, 
however, to point out briefly that each year sees certain concrete 
changes in secondary education which arise in the effort to emphasize 
the student’s needs. Take, for example, the differentiation of the 
curricula pursued by girls and boys. This may be illustrated first 
by a negative example. In a number of secondary schools, girls are 
excused from the mathematics courses. Gradually the colleges have 
receded in the matter of entrance requirements until the higher 
algebra which used to be common -has very largely disappeared. 
Now the pressure from the schools is very great to reduce the algebra 
further or to eliminate it altogether. This pressure is prompted in a 
very large measure by the objection which girls have to the courses. 
On the positive side, courses in household science and household art 
are becoming well-nigh universal. These courses are seldom taken by 
the boys, and the result is a growing consciousness on all sides that a 
differentiation between the courses offered to boys and girls is not 
only legitimate, but in increasing degree demanded. While the girls 
are engaged in the cooking and the sewing courses, the boys are 
taking mechanical drawing and shop courses of various types. 
EDUCATION SHOULD BE ADAPTED TO THE VOCATION. 
The segregation of the sexes is a matter of secondary importance, 
however, in the face of that most vital problem in American educa- 
tion, namely, the problem of adapting education to the future occu- 
pation of the student. A few years ago one heard the statement 
repeated with great show of belief that society as a whole could not 
be expected to pay for an individual’s education if he wanted to pre- 
pare for a profitable trade. Society paid only for culture or in 
general for nontechnical forms of knowledge. We now recognize 
that the State will pay for anything that trains its children. The 
chief question now is what will best train children. The problem 
of industrial education has thus come up in a new form, in a form 
which may be described by saying that we are now discussing the 
purely educational question, What is best for the individual and 
for the State? To be sure, the economic problem of paying for  
-P-A-G-E-137
    THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 83 
this best training is not met, but the State admits the principle 
that in some way the cost of education must ultimately be met. The 
prominent question now is what kind of training is demanded. 
It would be difficult to condense into a limited report any adequate 
statement of what is done in the high schools of the United States 
in the effort to solve the problem of vocational courses. Perhaps it 
will not be amiss to hazard the statement that every possible experi- 
ment is being made. Separate high schools for agriculture and for 
shopwork are in existence. Every possible shade of combination is 
being tried, from the high school that offers one textbook course in 
agriculture, or one shop course in woodwork or sewing, to the most 
elaborate cosmopolitan programs in which every type of shopwork 
is given a place beside the conventional subjects of the classical cur- 
riculum. <A survey of the situation at the present moment offers no 
ground for safe prognostication as to the final solution. There are 
strong partisan opinions in favor of the one or the other type of 
organization. The lay members of society who have to do with the 
government of schools through their membership on school boards 
are quite as likely to have strong partisan attitudes as educators are. 
Parents interested in their children in these schools, and the 
commercial world, which is ready to adopt the product of school 
training—all are partisan and often dogmatic in their views. Fortu- 
nately for the ultimate organization of schools, there is no dictator 
whose voice in this matter is to be final. The principle is clear, high 
schools must work out a group of courses that shall suit the needs 
of children. These courses will be manifold in content and in mode 
of administration. The concrete courses are evolving in an unsettled 
school system which is expanding at a most extraordinary rate. The 
final expression of the principle may safely be left to the future, 
when the partisan debates of the present will undoubtedly be taken 
up into a form of organization broad enough to satisfy all the legiti- 
mate demands which each party advocates. More specific statements 
as to tendencies are hardly safe. They would be colored by views 
which would undoubtedly seem to some reader dogmatic.   
CONTROL OF OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES. 
The lengthy survey under the third head of matters relating to 
the course of study leads to a fourth general subject of discussion, 
namely, the subject of outside activities. High schools are social 
centers in every community. In some communities the emphasis 
upon athletic activities, clubs, dances, parties, and the like, has 
tended to eclipse the social possibilities which naturally arise in the 
course of class work. A generation ago athletics, parties, clubs, 
etc., found little or no place in the public high school. There was, 
perhaps, a debating club, and there were a few evening gatherings, 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  “84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
but no such intense outside life as is now common. To some observ- 
ers the development of outside activities seems like an imitation of 
college life. The causes must, however, be sought in something more 
fundamental than mere imitation. One imitates only that toward 
which he is predisposed and for which he is partially prepared. If 
high-school students imitate college activities, it is because these 
activities supply a congenial outlet for energy which is present and 
not otherwise used, 
Whatever the source of these outside high-school activities, one 
general fact is evident to everyone who studies the situation. These 
activities have in many cases passed reasonable bounds, and in some 
way or other high schools must absorb the time and energy of stu- 
dents in more profitable ways. The most aggravated perversion of 
high-school energy is in the direction of the organization of secret 
societies. Several States have attempted to eradicate these secret 
societies by general legislation. In other cases boards of education 
without the sanction of State law have passed rules prohibiting 
secret societies, on the ground that they are a menace to the school. 
Drastic pledges have been formulated and presented and in some 
cases even signed. The net effect of all this effort at repression has 
been relatively small. In many centers the organizations continue 
even after all these steps have been taken. Of late a new element 
has been injected into the situation. The college fraternities and 
sororities, finding that public objection to the high-school organiza- 
tions is beginning to involve their interests also and that State 
legislatures are showing a disposition to deal with both high-school 
and college fraternities in the same prohibiting statute, have taken 
steps to warn high-school graduates that college fraternities will not 
elect to membership those who have been members of illicit high- 
school organizations. Whether this step, taken by several college 
fraternities, will be effective or not remains to be seen. There can 
be no doubt that college fraternities are more fully informed about 
high-school fraternities than high-school faculties are. If, there- 
fore, a vigorous campaign should be waged by the college fraterni- 
ties, there would be more information to start with than is now 
commonly at hand. 
The question arises, however, What would the high school face 
next if it did suppress secret societies? It is quite certain to be 
called on to face excessive emphasis of athletics. There are indica- 
tions now that athletics have gone as far as they ought to go, at 
least in their present form. Interschool games, generated by an 
undue eagerness for gate receipts and a pseudo-enthusiasm for the 
school, are already too distracting in many quarters. ~
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 85 
EXTEND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL. 
The solution of this whole problem undoubtedly lies in the enlarge- 
ment of the activities of the school. Several schools have wisely 
provided for the organization, under the sanction of the school itself, 
of a great deal of outside work. In some cases this work is very 
closely allied to school work. Thus boys are given supervision and 
credit for gardening, and even for more ambitious agricultural work. 
Students who have some talent for music are encouraged to take 
music at home or in voluntary after-school classes. The publication 
of a school paper, the continuation of shopwork after regular school 
hours, the opening of a school study room in the evening are all 
forms of outside activity which are promoted with success at different 
centers. In some cases the lines of activity cultivated are more remote 
from the school work. Thus the Boy Scout movement is organized, 
and various expeditions are undertaken into the country for camping 
purposes. Or the girls are organized into Campfire Girls’ clubs. 
One school at least has made a successful effort to stimulate a new 
and productive type of outside activity by organizing the whole com- 
munity so that it contributes to the school’s music and art. The stu- 
dents find these activities calling for a type of energy sufficiently 
different from that drawn upon in routine class work that the 
additional work serves as genuine recreation. At the same time the 
training derived is closely related to the regular school work. It is 
certainly desirable that the social activities of the school should take 
on this dual character of furnishing at once training and secondarily 
recreation. 
Each of these experiments which substitutes some positive kind of 
organization for that to which objection has been raised shows clearly 
that what high-school students need is more to do. Compared with 
the boy or the girl who goes into business at the end of the ele- 
mentary school course, the high-school student has a very light pro- 
gram. Various causes have operated during the past 10 years to 
make the program lighter rather than heavier. The elective system 
has tended to reduce somewhat the strenuousness of courses, both 
because the instructor is disposed to make a bid for numbers by not 
giving a course so heavy as to repel students of average ability, and 
also because the student can, through the exercise of his rights of 
election, select courses which are easy for him. The newer subjects 
which have come into the curriculum are sometimes less well organ- 
ized than the older subjects and lacking, therefore, in content or in 
compactness. These and other causes have tended to make it easy 
for the student to get through high school with a relatively small 
expenditure of energy on his regular class work. The tendency to 
take up outside activities appears in direct proportion to the reduc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
tion in the severity of regular work. Those who find in this situation 
a fortunate broadening of the student’s opportunity and those who 
view with pessimistic alarm the increase of outside engagements are 
both clear that there is here a grave problem in school organization. 
If the outside activities are to be an advantage, they must be organ- 
ized, and they must be selected so as to aid rather than distract from 
the class work. If, on the other hand, the outside activities become 
excessive, there should be substitutes and a proper control which can 
bring the student back to the class work. 
ADVANTAGES OF A LENGTHENED SCHOOL DAY. 
One remedy which is more discussed than tried is the lengthening 
of the school day. As suggested above, shopwork out of regular 
hours and study out of hours, but under the school roof, have been 
tried with success in a number of centers. But there is objection to 
the actual extension of the school day, because, in the first place, it 
would tax the instructors too heavily and, secondly, because in most 
high schools the students often have to go long distances in order 
to reach school. It may be said in answer to these objections that 
an arrangement which gives a long school day does not necessarily 
involve full attendance during the whole session on the part of each 
member of the teaching staff. Nor does the special student who 
makes a long trip to reach school necessarily need to spend all the 
hours of the session in the school. These matters being adjusted, as 
they easily may be, there is much to be said in favor of a longer super- 
vised period of school activity. A longer day would make it possible 
to put physical activity on a proper basis as a part of the supervised 
educative work of all students. It would give larger opportunity for 
supervised study and it would give much needed administrative relief 
in organizing individual curricula by distributing electives over more 
recitation periods. When one attempts to include all that is sug- 
gested as desirable in the school, there can be no doubt that the length- 
ening of the school day is theoretically the simplest first step in the 
solution of the problem. It will require time, however, to achieve 
such a solution. Most principals and boards would hesitate under 
present conditions to urge such a step, and most faculties would find 
reasons apparently based upon sound educational considerations for 
rejecting the proposal if it were made. 
In the meantime there are two indirect methods of extending school 
supervision over outside activities, both of which have been tried 
with gratifying success. In the first place, the school can supply in 
a greater degree than is usual supervision for a great variety of 
activities. In athletics the schools have commonly recognized the 
necessity of supplying a supervising instructor. The voluntary de- 
votion of individual instructors has often furnished supervision for
-P-A-G-E-141
  
THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 87 
clubs or other outside activities. The investment of supervisory 
energy in these student activities is becoming more and more common 
and is undoubtedly a justifiable charge against the instructorial 
budget of any school, As this demand comes to be recognized, there 
will grow up a class of teachers skilled in the type of supervision 
which is needed. Their work with students will practically extend 
the school day, even if that step is not formally taken. 
A second type of organization which has been successfully carried 
out is one in which the student systematically lays out his program 
for the whole day and thus extends the period of regulated work and 
recreation by organizing his own personal program. This adjust- 
ment can best be carried out by providing each student with a pro- 
gram card for the day and by discussing with him from time to time 
the economy of a well-ordered expenditure of time. The program 
should make liberal allowance for recreation and should thus em- 
phasize the value in individual development of systematic recreation, 
It should also leave to the student margins for self-directed intel- 
lectual activities. In short, it should be something more than a school 
program. If students can thus be induced to take charge of their 
own programs, much will be gained without enlarging at all the 
school equipment. The danger is that only the better students will 
have the strength of purpose to carry out such programs. 
The discussion of outside activities, like the discussion of the fuller 
curriculum, brings us to the conclusion that the high school can never 
go back to the simple program of a generation ago. Those who would 
repress outside school activities make the mistake of regarding them 
as unnecessary funguslike growths “to be cut off ‘Chis is an un- 
tenable view of these activities. They are here as part of the expan- 
sion of high-school life and they must be recognized and controlled. 
Some legitimate occupation must be found for the abundant energies 
of students. 
One phase of the general movement toward the extension of school 
activity which may properly be mentioned in this connection is the 
increasing practice of supplying students-with luncheon. All of the 
newer and better types of high-school buildings are providing a 
luncheon room. This room is sometimes used as a laboratory for the 
department of domestic science. This ideal arrangement does not in 
other cases seem possible, when the enterprise is let out by contract 
to a manager. There is great need of more adequate preparation of 
managers for school luncheon rooms. Also there is need of a keener 
recognition on the part of local authorities that the conduct of such 
a room should be in the hands of a well-trained officer, who can 
make the luncheon room contribute to the sound social and scientific 
spirit of the school.

  88 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
ALL-THE-YEAR SCHOOLS ARE DEMANDED. 
In connection with the discussion of the lengthening of the school 
day, reference must be made to the lengthening of the school year. 
Serious summer study has become a familiar fact in the lives of many 
teachers. There is a feeling on all sides that vacations are excessive, 
and that the student loses too much by the long suspension of activi- 
ties. Among that class in society which can afford to go to summer 
camps it is becoming a common practice for both boys and girls to 
seek during the summer a type of outdoor education that the regular 
school could hardly furnish. The great majority of city students, 
however, are cut off from such camping opportunities on any large 
scale. The question is coming to be more and more commonly asked, 
Why not keep schools open during the summer? In the meantime the 
demand for longer school sessions has become very loud on the part 
of students who have failed in one or two subjects and find themselves 
in danger of being failures. Summer high schools are, as a result 
of all these demands, beginning to appear. At the present stage 
these schools are usually of a special type, offering a limited number 
of courses, mostly of a manual nature or especially adapted to the 
needs of those who have failed. In a few centers the summer school 
is becoming regular in its offerings. There can be no doubt that this 
will become more common as ways and means are found. 
NIGHT SCHOOLS OFFER A FIELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. 
Another extension of the high school is into the night school. In 
a few conspicuous centers thespolicy has been definitely adopted of 
offering a broad course during the evening. In general, however, the 
night school is not regular in its work. The night school is usually 
a place for adults who have not had full school opportunities, or it is 
an aggregation of special industrial classes. The work is frequently 
not graded either as to the qualifications of the members of the class 
or with a view to distinguishing sharply between elementary work 
and secondary work. Finally, attendance is not so satisfactory as 
during the sessions of the regular school. All these irregularities 
show that the night school has not been fully organized. Somewhat 
more rigorous modes of administration have proved to be effective in 
foreign centers, and there will doubtless come a period in American 
organization of these additional schools when they will become some- 
what more regular in form and in student body. 
THE TRAINING OF SECONDARY-SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
No survey of the secondary-school situation would be complete 
without a discussion of the training of teachers. In all English- 
speaking countries the training of secondary teachers has been allowed
-P-A-G-E-143
  
THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 89 
to drift on without any special provision and for the most part with- 
out any supervision whatsoever. In this respect the United States, 
with England and Scotland, compare very unfavorably with France 
and Germany, where the training of secondary teachers is more fully 
provided for than the training of elementary teachers. 
The neglect of the training of high-school teachers is historically 
connected with the fact that these schools grew up without supervi- 
sion. The colleges were the real supervisors of the high schools until 
very recently, and the colleges were satisfied to send their graduates 
into the high schools as teachers without questioning seriously their 
ability to teach. It is interesting to note, in passing, the obvious his- 
torical fact that the colleges exhibited very little confidence in these 
graduates after they became high-school teachers. The colleges for 
a long period dictated in truly paternal fashion every step that the 
high-school teacher should take. The high-school teacher in turn, 
feeling very little responsibility for the organization of curricula and 
having no special training in the history of education and little 
knowledge of the problems of school organization, was proud of his 
detachment from pedagogy and somewhat scornful of his colleagues 
of the elementary schools, who frankly absorbed themselves in dis- 
cussions of method. 
As pointed out above, the evolution of the high school has brought 
out its problems with such clearness that secondary teachers have 
been forced to take up pedagogical consideration. In the meantime 
State departments have developed far enough to see that if an ele- 
mentary-school teacher needs to be licensed to teach and needs super- 
vision, at least during the early years of his work, the secondary 
teacher certainly requires equal attention. Colleges have come to 
recognize that the strong high school will grow up where there is a 
strong staff of instructors alive to the problems of the school and not 
acquiescing in the dictates of an external institution. Therefore the 
wiser colleges are striving to raise in the minds of the high-school 
teachers, both in service and in preparation, a realization of the 
problems of high-school organization. Finally, the demonstrated 
efficiency of those schools which manage themselves on scientific prin- 
ciples has opened up an era of study of high-school problems which 
arouses in the mind of the scientific student of education the most 
optimistic hopes for the future of the training of high-school teachers. 
THE TENURE OF TEACHERS IS TOO SHORT. 
In the midst of these optimistic views it must be admitted that 
there is the shadow of pessimism when one studies the present situa- 
tion as it really appears when examined in detail. A recent study 
made by Prof. Jessup (School Review, October, 1913) shows that 
high-school teachers are a most migratory class. Not only the teach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  90 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
ers, but also the principals of high schools, change with a frequency 
which almost destroys the hope of developing anything like a definite 
policy within these institutions. This transient character of the 
high-school instructorial staff is understood when one considers, first, 
the lack of special training, to which reference has just been made. 
The second fact which explains the situation is the lack of apprecia- 
tion on the part of communities of the advantage to the school of 
continuity in educational policy. Boards of education are themselves 
in many cases very transient, and they add to their own short term 
entire willingness to make experiments with new principals and new 
teachers. All these causes result in the migration which Prof. Jessup 
so vividly portrays. Finally, there is the more general fact that 
many teachers are engaged in the work for only a few years between 
college and some other calling. Some of the annual changes are ac- 
cordingly to be understood as complete withdrawals from the teach- 
ing profession. 
Whatever the causes—and the above list is doubtless only a partial 
one—the result is most disastrous for high-school education. It is very 
often the experience of a high-school student passing through a single 
school that he will be under from two to four principals and will 
have even in the same subject a great variety of different types of in- 
struction. If one could be sure that each change experienced by such 
a student is in the direction of improvement, there might be com- 
placency about the matter, but a succession of reforms which are un- 
finished experiments at all stages is not likely to be altogether in the 
direction of improvement. 
DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION IN COLLEGES. 
The lack of proper training among high-school teachers and their 
short tenure of office are part of the general problem created by the 
rapid development of secondary schools. Whatever contributes to a 
better organization of these schools will contribute to a solution of 
the problem of supplying better teachers. If the high school can be 
better defined and its work systematized, the reflex influence of these 
improvements will immediately be felt in the longer tenure of teach- 
ers and in a higher type of professional spirit and performance. The 
same agencies which are operating to improve high schools through 
a better definition of their problems are contributing to the better 
preparation of high-school teachers for their professional work. 
Conspicuous among these agencies are the departments of education 
in the State universities. The large responsibility of the State uni- 
versity for all forms of education in the State has long been recog- 
nized in the established systems of high-school inspection. In a 
number of States the inspector is a man of very large influence.
-P-A-G-E-145
            THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 91 
Where the work of the inspector is guided by a clear insight, emphasis 
has been laid upon the training of teachers and their distribution 
through the schools. This has led to the development of strong de- 
partments for the training of teachers. 
The example of the State universities in this respect has prompted 
all colleges to take up very generally the organization of departments 
of education. In some cases this imitation has been of a rather re- 
mote and ineffective type. Courses are sometimes announced for 
teachers which differ only in their announcement from the conven- 
tional course offered to other students. Thus one finds that a course 
in algebra for teachers is nothing but an ordinary course in higher 
algebra. A course in history for teachers includes no mention of any 
principles of method. It is a course in that period of history with 
which the school courses deal. Perhaps the efforts of colleges to meet 
the demand that they train secondary teachers ought not to be 
criticized in spite of the superficial way in which the work is some- 
times done. It is a new undertaking, and as such is sure to show some 
marks of immaturity. 
One great defect in most institutions which aim to train secondary 
teachers is the complete lack of facilities for giving the student any 
practice teaching. The German system provides for a long period 
of instruction in the duties of classroom management as an essential 
part of the training of every secondary teacher. There are very few 
institutions in this country equipped even to afford adequate oppor- 
tunities for observation to those who are preparing to become high- 
school teachers. In this matter there must undoubtedly be general 
improvement. The institutions which train elementary teachers have 
always recognized the imperative necessity of practical contact with 
the classroom as a part of the equipment of every teacher in training. 
Colleges will have to recognize the same fact if they are to give 
adequate preparation to high-school teachers. 
NORMAL-SCHOOL TRAINING FOR SECONDARY TEACHERS. 
  In this connection it is important to discuss the fact that a num- 
ber of normal schools in different parts of the country have taken up 
the problem of training high-school teachers as a part of their work. 
There is indeed no agreement among the principals and the teachers 
of normal schools in this matter. There are strong partisans of the 
view that it is the sole business of the normal schools to train ele- 
mentary teachers. Probably the majority of the officers of normal 
schools hold to this view in more or less pronounced degrees. On 
the other hand, there are partisans, some of them most emphatic in 
their expressions, of the view that only the normal schooi can give 
satisfactory training to secondary teachers. Those who hold to this 
      
    
-P-A-G-E-146
  92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
latter position point to the fact that the normal school is historically 
the only institution in the country which has aimed to deal with the 
teaching problem. They point to the fact that through all the gen- 
erations the secondary schools have been manned by teachers un- 
trained in the practical side of their work, and finally they point 
to the present training given in departments of education in colleges 
and universities and criticize this kind of training as purely theo- 
retical, unaccompanied by practice teaching or criticism. 
It should perhaps be added that practical school superintendents 
emphasize the importance of training received in the classroom as 
more desirable than the theoretical training given in educational 
lectures. Where normal-school graduates have been brought into 
comparison with graduates of colleges in high schools which appoint 
both on their faculties, the advantage has sometimes been reported 
to be with the normal-school graduates. The normal schools have 
thus gained in some quarters the support of school superintendents 
in the contention that these schools can prepare teachers quite as 
well as colleges, if not better. 
There is no immediate prospect that the normal schools will be 
able to take up in any general way the work of training high-school 
teachers. If there were no other consideration in the way of the 
normal schools in this field of operations, the fact that there are at 
the present time no adequate facilities in any of the States for the 
training of elementary teachers would settle the matter. The ex- 
ample of the few normal schools which do train secondary teachers 
will in the meantime serve as a stimulating example to the college 
departments, which have up to this time unquestionably been open 
to the just criticism that they are too abstract and theoretical. 
A final matter which has been brought out in recent reports is the 
matter of the distribution of a trained teacher’s energy over a great 
variety of unrelated subjects. The extreme phase of the evil which 
is suggested by this statement is the case of the teacher who is 
trained to teach one or two subjects and is drafted off when he begins 
his work into subjects for. which he has no training. It is not 
uncommon for the teachers of physics and of Latin to be assigned 
for their unoccupied time to teach classes in history or English. In 
the small schools such a mixing of subjects is inevitable. The sec- 
ondary assignments ought to be made, however, with due regard to 
efficiency. 
On the other side, teachers ought to be trained with the facts fully 
in view. In this matter many college departments have a lesson to 
learn. The college department which requires two-thirds of a 
student’s time for a given specialty fails to prepare that student for 
the real position which he will find open to him when he begins to 
teach. The high schools are very seldom as highly specialized as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
THE STATUS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 93 
colleges and not even remotely like the universities in this respect. 
Departments in universities can with advantage study the actual 
demands made upon their students after graduation. The professor 
of mathematics or physics or Latin will then realize that he is mak- 
ing a very inefficient teacher by encouraging too high a degree of 
specialization. 
A NEW ERA OF PROFESSIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 
It remains to comment briefly on the fact that in secondary schools, 
as in other branches of the educational system, there is a clear recog- 
nition of the new profession of administration. Formerly a school 
was supposed to run itself, if only the classes were held. From time 
to time some matter of discipline might so disrupt the work of the 
school as to call for special attention, and then there was an emer- 
gency officer who could be called in. The second stage of evolution 
was reached when, in the complex organization of the school, some 
one had to be appointed to settle all matters not settled in the sepa- 
rate classrooms. This central officer usually found that the purchase 
of supplies and the conciliation of parents are the chief matters not 
attended to in the classroom. Often a community has suffered because 
a competent teacher has been taken away from his professional 
work of instruction to carry on the clerical work of a1 office. Even 
in this second period there were administrators who found time for 
the study of students, of teachers, of courses of study, of other school 
systems, and of like stimulating subjects. Such true administrators 
found themselves limited, however, because the information which 
they needed was not easy to get and the methods which they had at 
hand were altogether inadequate as methods of administrative study. 
A new era of administration is at hand. The best example to 
select for purpose of illustration is, perhaps, the example of school 
grades. The time was—and now is in many quarters—when a school 
grade was almost impossible of interpretation except to the initiated. 
A certain instructor gave a student the mark 90. No one could under- 
stand this mark unless he knew whether the teacher was a “ hard ” 
marker or an “easy” marker. To-day the progressive high-school 
principal has in the simple method of distribution tables a means 
of objectively checking up each teacher’s practice. Furthermore, 
each school has the possibility of comparing its methods with those of 
other schools, including the colleges to which some of its graduates go. 
Some administrators are adopting an analytical method of dealing 
with the grades of students. Instead of a formal percentage mark, 
they are filing a report from each teacher which describes such 
matters as the student’s devotion, or lack of devotion, to the prepa- 
ration of his work, the student’s willingness to receive and profit
-P-A-G-E-148
94 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
by criticism, his readiness of reproduction of what he has learned. 
This effort to analyze the psychology of the individual student may 
be recognized as the administrative side of the general movement, 
described in an earlier paragraph, toward more careful supervision 
of class study. When the high-school world is supplied with a body 
of empirical results, based upon a careful study of the best methods 
of recording students’ work, the position of the professional adminis- 
trator will be fully justified. 
To be sure, there is some hesitation on the part of the school boards 
to invest very much public money in what they often regard as useless 
research. But studies of elimination, of relative grades, of the stand- 
ings of graduates in college, of the effects of vocational guidance, of 
the influence on attendance of new curricula, will soon produce a body 
of objective, standardized knowledge regarding secondary schools 
which will convince the most skeptical. The creation of this type of 
knowledge in high-school offices is no less significant a development 
than the general expansion of the secondary schools and the enlarge- 
ment and organization of their curricula.

I. ADMINISTRATION. 
The tendency toward centralization in school administration, noted 
in previous reports, shows no signs of abatement. Reduction in size 
of school boards, appointment or election at large, instead of by 
wards, the employment of business experts, and the extension of 
professional control on the educational side are policies that are 
commanding increased attention and gradually but surely gaining 
recognition as fundamental in education. 
Recently in Chicago the superintendent of schools tendered her 
resignation on account of committee interference in professional 
matters for which the community has come to expect the superin- 
tendent to be responsible. An aroused public opinion was followed 
by the filling of vacancies in the board by members favorable to the 
superintendent’s initiative in all educational policies and the board 
thus constituted refused to accept the superintendent’s resignation. 
Thus was the modern principle of professional control in educational 
matters validated in our second, largest city. 
The board of education of Jackson, Mich., has this year withdrawn 
all salaries from its own members and officers. These salaries have 
heretofore amounted to from $1,500 to $3,000 per year, depending 
upon the amount of work required of certain committees. The 
board has now adopted the policy of having all work possible done 
by paid employees who are not board members. By cutting off all 
remuneration from its membership the board is free to legislate on 
all matters without the possibility of anyone charging any member 
with being influenced by selfish considerations or personal interests. 
95  
-P-A-G-E-150
    96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
It was the idea that membership on the board should be looked upon 
solely as a service to the community. 
In St. Louis it has been necessary within the year to get a legal 
opinion upon a question involving the exclusive charter right of the 
superintendent of schools to initiate educational measures, but in 
that city the opinion adverse to the right of nonprofessional initia- 
tive was apparently accepted as final and no legislative action has 
been sought looking toward the removal of the safeguards against 
lay interference embodied in the charter of 1909. 
OPINION OF THE ATTORNEY ON POWERS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION. 
I herewith submit my opinion on the power of thé board to adopt and to put into 
effect the resolution offered by Dr. J. P. Harper at the May meeting of the board. 
That resolution had for its object a material change in the organization of the teaching 
force and would have had an important bearing on the conduct of the schools. Its 
adoption was sought without regard to the opinion or recommendation thereon of the 
superintendent of instruction. The question is: Has the board, as distinguished 
from its superintendent of instruction, the power under the law to deal with sucha 
question as this? What are the relative rights of the board and its executive officers, 
particularly its superintendent of instruction? 
Reference to sections 11029 et seq. of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1909, being 
the charter of the Board of Education of the city of St. Louis, will quickly dispose 
of the question. At the very outset, in section 2 of the charter (sec, 11030, R. 8. 
Mo., 1909), it is provided: 
Every city in this State now having or which may hereafter have five hundred 
thousand inhabitants or more * * * shall be and constitute a single school dis- 
trict, shall be a body corporate, and the supervision and government of pubhe schools and 
public school property therein shall be vested in a board of 12 members = andina 
superintendent of instruction and a commissioner of school buildings. 
Thus, in the very section of the act creating the board and dealing with its powers 
and duties, the legislature expressly states that the government of public schools 
and public school property shall be vested not in the board alone, as might be supposed, 
but in the board and in the stiperintendent of instruction and commissioner of school 
buildings. : 
But by section 7 of the act (sec. 11035, R. S. Mo., 1909) the powers of the superin- 
tendent of instruction and his duties and obligations are specifically set forth and 
defined. There it is provided the superintendent shall nominate his assistants, The 
number of them and their salaries are to be fixed by the board, but who they shall 
be is determined by the superintendent, and not by the board. * * * Thesection 
closes with the provision that the superintendent “shall be responsible to the board for 
the condition of instruction and discipline of the schools.” 
Under the provisions of the charter, the board of education, as distinguished from 
its executive officers, is given exclusive authority over the expenditure of public 
money for school purposes. * * * It is charged with the responsibility of securing 
the best qualified experts available to carry on the work of public education and then 
is under the obligation to supervise the work of such experts and to see to it that they 
are performing their duties adequately and efficiently. 
But it is obvious that by virtue of the provisions of the statutes above quoted, the 
organization of the teaching force of the public school system is entirely under the 
supervision and control of the superintendent of instruction, and any change therein 
can be made only when recommended by him. If the board of education, as dis- 
tinguished from its instruction department, were to exercise such power as was
-P-A-G-E-151
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 97 
attempted to be invoked by the resolution under consideration, it is conceivable that 
asituation might easily develop wherein the superintendent of instruction, an expert 
chosen by reason of his peculiar qualifications as an educator, would be without any 
voice in the organization of the teaching force, and consequently, without any power 
or control over the organization of the instruction and of the discipline of the schools, 
and yet, by reason of the express provisions of the statutes, be still chargeable with the 
responsibility for the proper conduct of the schools. * * * 
This is the most vital and most important feature of our charter, and is the feature 
that distinguishes it from the school law which preceded it, and from school laws 
generally existing throughout the country at the time our charter wasadopted. * * * 
That this view of our school law was well understood and acknowledged by those 
interested in its enactment is abundantly demonstrated, not only by the testimony of 
its framers and advocates, but also by contemporaneous publications discussing and 
analyzing the new legislation. * * * A society was formed called the Civic Feder- 
ation, whose sole object was to draft a new school law and to bring about its enactment 
by the General Assembly of Missouri. * * * There were people and publications, 
of course, who were opposed, to the bill which this committee prepared and which the 
Civic Federation induced the legislature to adopt. That these opponents of the 
measure recognized and acknowledged the great power and independence given by the 
new law to the superintendent of instruction is seen in the articles appearing at the 
time in the St. Louis “Mirror”? which gave much space to criticisms on this very 
pont. 
And that the great power and independence of the superintendent of instruction 
are not an unforeseen and accidental result of haphazard legislation, but were delib- 
erately planned and intended by the framers of the law, is equally discoverable from. 
the newspapers and periodicals of the time. Members of the Civic Federation com- 
mittee testify with positiveness and pride that this was the chief end they as a com- 
mittee unanimously worked to accomplish. The view of these framers of our charter 
was reflected in an article published in 1903 in the ‘Educational Review.” * * * 
The article appears in volume 26, pages 464 et seq., and was written by Mr. Edward 
C. Elliot, one of the leading members of the St. Louis bar. * * * Not only does 
it make clear the relative rights, duties, and powers of the board and its executive 
officers, but it also brings out most conspicuously the great advantage to the school 
system of St. Louis resulting from the scheme of school administration established by 
our charter: 
“The fundamental principle of the St. Louis law lies in the centralization of the 
administrative functions in expert school officers, while the supervisory control is 
left to persons elected by the people, but not specially qualified in the various depart- 
ments of educational work. To attain the efficiency of one man, together with the 
wisdom of a larger number, not impairing either quality by the intermingling of their 
duties, is the new element of discovery, if such it may be called, in connection with 
this law. : 
* * * * * * * 
“The business of the schools is divided among four departments, over each of which 
is an officer appointed by the board. These officers are known as ‘Superintendent of 
Instruction,’ ‘Commissioner of School Buildings,’ ‘Secretary and Treasurer,’ and 
‘Auditor.’ The law defines the qualifications, which are such as specially fit the 
officers for their respective duties. Their terms of office are fixed, and they can be 
removed by the board only upon a two-thirds vote and for cause. Immediately upon 
their appointment they become to a great extent independent of the board and directly 
responsible to the public.”

98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In 1905, Boston reduced the number of members of its school 
committee from 24 to 5. Persistent attempts have been made, one 
within the year, to increase the membership, but so far without avail. 
In other cities which have reduced the size of their school boards, 
there appear to have been no serious attempts to return to former 
conditions. In the list of cities that have reduced the size of the school 
board are: Perth Amboy, N. J.; Naugatuck, Conn.; New Orleans, 
La.; Lynn, Mass.; Covington, Lexington, Newport, and Paducah, 
Ky.; and Newton and New Bedford, Mass. Under the commission 
form of government, Chattanooga, Tenn., has one commissioner of 
education instead of a board of education. Stockton and Sacramento, 
Cal., and Salem, Mass., have changed from the district with large 
board to a commission form with five members. The Kansas State 
Legislature two years agd enacted a law providing for boards of edu- 
cation composed of six members in all cities of the first and second 
class, thatis, all cities of 2,000 population or more. The State of Ohio 
has this year enacted a law which limits the size of school boards in all 
cities of the State. Boards in cities of less than 50,000 inhabitants 
will consist of not less than three nor more than five members elected 
at large; similarly in cities of 50,000 to 150,000 inhabitants the 
minimum number of members will be two and the maximum seven; 
in cities of more than 150,000 inhabitants the corresponding limits 
on membership are five as a minimum, seven as a maximum. All 
cities in Pennsylvania, except Altoona and Wilkes-Barre, havereduced 
the size of their school boards under the provisions of the new State 
code. Inevery case the smaller board has been more efficient and 
business has been transacted more promptly and with less friction. 
The New York City school board still consists of 46 members. Re- 
cently the two experts who were employed by the board of estimate 
to investigate the organization, status, and procedure of the depart- 
ment of education, Prof. Goodnow, of Columbia University, and 
Dr. Howe, of the People’s Institute, have announced their findings and 
recommendations: 
The board of education is acting upon the false conception of its proper powers and. 
functions. Instead of confining itself to the larger problems of legislation and surveil- 
lance contemplated for it by the charter and dictated to it by all considerations of 
efficiency, it has attempted to intervene either as a whole or through standing com- 
mittees in the overwhelming mass of minute details involved in the administration 
of the department. 
The board should divest itself of all its purely administrative functions. 
It should abolish its present committee organization. 
It should be reduced in size. The charter should be amended to provide that the 
board shall consist of eight members, three of whom shall represent the city at large 
and shall have three votes each, and the remaining five of whom shall be appointed, 
one from each of the five boroughs, with the members from Manhattan, the Bronx, 
and Brooklyn having two votes each and the members from Queens and Richmond 
having one vote each.

  PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 99 
The experts state that this reorganization along these lines would 
promote facility in handling the larger affairs and problems of the 
board of education, and would place the purely detailed matter of 
administration upon the school and supervising authorities. 
It is not always the big city that needs to have its school admin- 
istration simplified. Among the cities that have new charters 
Schenectady, N. Y., furnishes a striking example of what to avoid 
in charter making. The school board of this city furnishes the tax- 
payers with the following information: 
The Schenectady public schools are conducted under a special school charter 
which became effective May 23, 1908. This charter provides for a board of education 
of five members, appointed by the mayor. The term of three members expires one 
year, of two members the next, and so on alternately. In this way each mayor, elected 
for two years, has the power to appoint an entirely new board of education. 
The charter defines the powers and duties of the board, making both positive and 
negative provisions. 
Positive provisions. 
The board— 
1. Elects annually one of its members president. 
2. Elects annually a secretary who shall not be a member of the board. 
8. Elects a superintendent of schools for an indeterminate term. 
4, Appoints clerks, attendance officers, physicians, nurses, teachers, etc. 
5. Prescribes the courses of study, textbooks, and all apparatus of instruction, 
*6. Adopts rules for the general management of the schools, 
7. Recommends the purchase of land for school sites. 
8. Recommends the erection of new buildings. 
Negative provisions. 
The board— 
1. Shall not appoint school janitors. 
. Shall not control the janitors. 
. Shall have no voice in determining when school buildings shall be altered or 
repaired. 
4, Shall have no power to prepare plans or draw up specifications for new 
buildings. 
5. Shall have no power to fix salaries of any employees, whether clerk, nurse, 
physician, teacher, principal, or superintendent. 
6. Shall have no power to expend money, but all purchases shall be made by the 
commissioner of public works. 
7. Shall have only limited powers of contract. 
8. Shall own nothing, sell nothing. 
By charter provision, therefore, the commissioner of public works transacts the 
following board of education business: 
1. Appoints janitors. 
. Defines the duties of janitors. 
. Transfers janitors. 
. Determines when repairs shall be made and decides what these repairs shall be. 
. Prepares plans for new buildings and writes specifications for the same. 
. Expends all the money in the board of education budget except teachers’ 
salaries.

The board of estimate and apportionment transacts the following board of education 
business: 
1. Fixes all salaries of janitors, nurses, physicians, teachers, principals, super- 
intendent. 
The board of aldermen control the following board of education business: 
1. Purchase of school sites by recommendation of the board of education. 
2, The alteration of old buildings. 
3. The erection of new buildings. 
The board of contract and supply transacts the following board of education busi- 
ness through the commissioner of public works: 
- 1. Makes all purchases amounting to more than $250 and writes the specifica- 
tions for the articles purchased, such as pianos, scientific instruments, 
manual-training equipment, school furniture, library books, textbooks, ete. 
2. Makes all contracts and writes the specifications for the same, such as build- 
ing constructions, ash collections, etc. 
3. Sells school properties when authorized by the board of aldermen. 
In contrast with this compiex administrative scheme, that pro- 
vided for the Pittsburgh school system under the new Pennsylvania 
Code is impressive in its simplicity. 
The city of Pittsburgh was constituted a city of the first class by the enactment of 
the school code May 18,1911. Under the new law, which became operative in Novem- 
ber of the same year, the entire management of the public schools of Pittsburgh 
_ and the former Allegheny school district is vested in a body of 15, who are appointed 
by the judges of the courts of common pleas for a term of six years, and who are col- 
lectively and officially known as the board of public education. The secretary, 
who is not a member, is the board’s general executive. 
The board of education has three standing committees—finance and administration, 
property and supplies, and instruction. 
The school controller, elected by the people as the city controller, approves all 
financial orders authorized by the board not contrary to law and audits all accounts 
of the board. The school treasurer receives all funds belonging to the district and 
pays out the same on proper orders approved by the school controller. 
The superintendent of buildings has general charge of all matters pertaining to the 
physical school plant, including construction, repairs, permanent equipment, and. 
operation, The superintendent of supplies is the general purchasing and distribut- 
ing officer of the board and has charge of all material duly authorized for the various 
departments in school operation. 
The superintendent of schools is the educational head of the school system and is 
elected for a term of four years. He is empowered to recommend to the board all 
subordinates in his department, plan and supervise their work, and shape the con- 
structive policy of the schools. In the general supervision he is aided by one asso- 
ciate superintendent and four assistant district superintendents. The individual 
school, with its corps of teachers under a principal, constitutes the unit in local man- 
agement. 
Il. MEASURING THE SCHOOL’S EFFICIENCY. 
The attempt to establish definite standards of efficiency is as new 
in the business and industrial field as it is in education. Mr. Taylor 
began his experiments at the Midvale Steel Works, in the system 
now known by his name, fully 20 years before he was ready to 
announce his plans, and in all probability another 20 years will have 
passed before the Taylor System will have made converts of a majority
-P-A-G-E-155
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 101 
of employers and employees in the industrial field. The efficiency 
expert has the task yet before him to fully justify his existence 
to the satisfaction of the average business man, the manufacturer, 
the employee, the board of education, and the teacher; but unques- 
tionably he is making progress. His task is probably more diffi- 
cult in the educational field than in any other field in which he is 
at work, because education is so much a matter of the spirit. How- 
ever, there is a statistical side that admits of definite formulation, 
and there is a business side which can just as advantageously be 
subjected to scrutiny as the corresponding features of a strictly 
business enterprise. Then too, of late, the expert is finding ways of 
measuring the accomplishments of children in the subjects that are 
taught in the schoolroom. The work of Stone and Courtis in arith- 
metic, the scales for measuring the quality of handwriting by Thorn- 
dike and Ayers, and the scale for measuring English composition 
by Hillegas, are already well known and widely used. 
Three methods of measurement have been used in school investi- 
gations—measurement by personal opinion, measurement by com- 
parison, and measurement by standards or units. Prof. George 
Drayton Strayer, in his report to the National Council of Education, 
on ‘‘Standards and Tests for Measuring the Efficiency of Schools or 
Systems of Schools,’”’ characterizes these three methods as follows: 
Educators and laymen have always expressed opinions with respect to the efficiency 
of our schools. In recent years there has been developed, along with a refine- 
ment in the technique of investigation in education, a remarkable public interest 
in the attempts to evaluate our educational practice. School inquiries, investiga- 
tions, or surveys have been conducted, or are planned, in a great many cities through- 
out the United States. In each case there is the supposition that such an inquiry or 
investigation will measure the efficiency of the schools. It has not always been 
clear, either to those making the survey or to those who read the reports, that three 
distinct types of measurement: have been employed or three sets of standards of 
tests applied. It is possible to characterize each investigation, or each part of some 
of the larger surveys, by one of the three following methods of measurement: First, 
measurement by personal opinion; second, measurement by comparison; or, third, 
measurement by more or less well-established standards or units. 
Measurement by personal opinion is valuable in just the degree in which the per- 
son passing the judgment is, by training and experience, qualified to give an intelli- 
gent opinion. Such personal judgments have frequently suggested comparisons with 
other communities, and have at times, no doubt, been based upon more or less well- 
established standards. The chief characteristic of this type of report, however, is 
found in the fact that the author does not feel that it is necessary either to appeal to 
a painstaking comparison with other similar situations or to state the standards which 
he uses in passing his judgment. Often the individual who is expressing a personal 
opinion seeks to give dignity to his statements by saying that he speaks in terms of 
facts. In effect, his argument is that the situation as he sees it, and as he has described 
it, leads inevitably to a conclusion with respect to the strength or weakness of the 
school system that has come under his observation. Of course, no such appeal to 
facts can modify the situation. Unless careful comparisons have been instituted, 
or commonly accepted standards applied in passing the judgment, the opinion 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
expressed in the light of the so-called facts which have been discovered remains simply 
an opinion. 
Measurement by comparison is based upon the fundamental idea that the common 
practice is the result of the judgment of many men who have attempted to solve the 
same or very similar problems. In reports which have used the method of measure- 
ment by comparison, the most common practice is used as the standard to which 
each local situation is referred. Such comparisons have been made with regard to 
expenditures, the progress and classification of children through the grades of the 
school system, the amount of time devoted to school subjects, supervisory provision, 
teacher training, tenure, and the like. In the derivation of standards of efficiency 
it will always be necessary to employ the comparative method. Any adequate 
derivation of standards will, however, involve much more than comparison. Meas- 
urement in any field is not successful merely because we are able to say that one quan- 
tity is more or less than another. It is only when we have a measuring stick which 
enables us to describe all of the quantities with which we deal in terms of definitely 
determined units that we can claim to have any adequate method of measurement. 
We are only beginning to have measurement undertaken in terms of standards or 
units which are, or which may become, commonly recognized. Such standards will 
undoubtedly be developed by means of applying scientifically derived scales of 
measurement to many systems of schools. From such measurements it will be possible 
to describe accurately the accomplishment of children and to derive a series of stand- 
ards which will be applicable to varying groups of children and to different social 
demands. 
Ill. DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND EFFICIENCY 
BUREAUS. 
For several years throughout the United States there has been an 
attempt to standardize annual school reports so that any school sys- 
tem could compare its problems and results with those of other school 
systems. One who remembers the school reports of 10 years ago 
can not fail to be impressed with the progress that has been made in 
recording and analyzing records of enrollment, attendance, foreign 
parentage of pupils, ages of pupils in each of the grades, the number 
of pupils who left school during the year and the causes, together 
with other data of great significance. Even greater progress has 
been made in the standardization of school accounting. The uni- 
form system recommended by the Bureau of Education has been 
adopted by nearly all of the larger school systems. 
School superintendents appreciate the necessity of making studies 
on the basis of fact furnished by significant educational data and of 
knowing the cost of each feature of the enterprise for which they are 
responsible, but they find that if they deal effectively with this 
important feature of school administration, they must perforce 
neglect other features of their work no less important. 
The solution proposed and actually put in operation in several 
cities is the organization of all work of this sort for the school system 
into a department. New York City is to have a ‘‘Bureau of refer- 
ence and research,’”’ Baltimore has a ‘‘Bureau of statistics and
-P-A-G-E-157
ee ee 
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 108 
research,”’ New Orleans has a ‘‘Departmént of educational research,” 
and Rochester, N. Y., has an ‘‘Efficiency bureau.’”’ The president 
of the board of education of Rochester explains the need to be met 
by the bureau, as follows: 
A business corporation has always the tangible control of loss or profit, to check 
expenses and measure efficiency. A municipal corporation has no such tangible 
control. The importance, therefore, of a system and method of accounting that will 
clearly interpret to the taxpayers the cost of the various functions of the school work, 
and give such comparative records as will test in great measure the efficiency and the 
proper cost of such functions, is most important. A part of the work of the efficiency 
bureau has been the installation of a new accounting system, which is based upon the 
principle of appropriating definite portions of school money for definite phases of 
educational expenditure, in contradistinction to the plan of appropriating a lump 
sum for all school costs to be subdivided according to the subsequent demands of 
the various activities. For some years Rochester has been moving from the old 
time lump-sum budget to the fully analyzed functional budget. 
Under the educational division of the work of the efficiency bureau there are grouped 
three departments: First, a bureau of information to take care of every inquiry coming 
to the department within and without the city, without encroaching on the valuable 
time of high-salaried office heads; second, a bureau of statistics to gather and publish 
school facts and figures as the demands of the public, board of education, and the 
officers of the business and educational research, in which the special educational 
problems of the Rochester school system may be worked out for the benefit of the 
public, without hindering the usual progress of routine duties or incurring neglect 
of one educational activity by reason of overattention to another. 
The director of the bureau adds details, some of which we quote: 
Every school system is continually involved in the preparation of reports. The 
various members gather data for the city superintendent, who for the city asa 
whole assembles material for the State and Federal Departments. In a modern city 
school system this reporting assumes such proportions as to require a special place 
and a special agent to receive, check, and file the documents from schools and offices. 
Rochester needed an office where this work could be performed without converting 
the city superintendent and other office heads into clerks from time to time. 
Conditions in individual schools must be brought to the attention of the superin- 
tendentand supervisors. To accomplish this, all incoming reports must be scrutinized 
and from the total a digest must be prepared of such points as require the judgment 
of the superintendent or other office heads. Otherwise these administration officers 
would spend more time in determining where to act than in actual administrative 
duties. Rochester needed an office to study, analyze, and present local situations 
to the proper authorities. 
After conditions had been brought to the superintendent’s attention, the central 
office often sends reports to each school showing the principal the standing of his 
school compared with the average for the entire city. Rochester needed an office to 
do this work without interrupting or crowding out the necessary work of office heads. 
In addition to bringing delinquent schools to the standard of the city, the superin- 
tendent is expected to keep the whole system up to the standard generally attained 
throughout the country. Rochester needed an office to measure the work of the city 
with that of the country at large. 
Progressive superintendents, supervisors, and principals not only keep alive to 
educational achievements throughout the country, but from time to time also desire 
to make independent or original investigations in their particular fields of work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  | 104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Rochester needed an office to conduct such research work without the suspension of 
the regular duties of those desiring the information sought. 
An intelligent interpretation of school accounts is only possible by the reduction 
of cost figures to a per capita basis. These computations often require quite intricate 
registration and attendance statistics, which lie entirely without the province of the 
bookkeeper. Rochester needed an office to translate the secretary’s account books 
into per capita units. 
Generally frequent and always urgent are the calls for emergency services of 
stenographers, clerks, draftsmen, and messengers. Rochester needed an office to 
perform this rush work without resorting to outside hour-by-hour service or the 
employment of supply teachers. 
ORGANIZATION. . 
These needs were presented to the board of education in the course of the work 
of installing new and revised educational records in the several offices of the depart- 
ment. The result was that on January 1, 1913, a permanent bureau of school efficiency 
was authorized by the board and made one of the regular administrative offices of 
the system. 
The functions of the efficiency bureau correspond to the needs already described, 
and are: 
(1) Receiving and keeping on file all reports of enrollment, attendance, and progress 
of children in the schools. 
(2) Analyzing reports received. 
(3) Presenting salient features to supervising officers. 
(4) Reporting situations to individual schools. 
(5) Measuring the efficiency of local educational work with that of other cities, 
(6) Conducting research work. 
These functions are performed through the services of: One director, one of the 
assistant superintendents of schools; one stenographer, acting as head office clerk; 
one stenographer; two card and record clerks. 
The office records, as far as possible, take the form of standard-sized cards. All 
forms and blanks are reduced to letterhead size. Computations are made with the 
adding machines and slide rule, and business-office methods are employed. 
The files of the efficiency bureau contain the following information, by months: 
(1) For each school, grade, and special class: (a) Enrollment from September to 
June; (b) month-end register; (c) attendance. 
(2) Elimination from school by permanent card record: (a) Causes; (b) grades; 
(c) ages; (d) months; (e) schools. 
(3) Progress through school for each school and grade: (2) Double promotions; (b) 
single promotions; (c) trial promotions; (d) nonpromotions; (e) final result after 
trial period; (f) examination results; (g) progress charts of schools and individual 
classes showing rapid, normai, and slow progress combined with under, normal, and 
over age. 
(4) Contributions of teachers and principals who have visited schools elsewhere. 
(5) Replies to all questionnaires and other inquiries about Rochester schoois since 
January, 1912. 
(6) Superintendents’ reports from other cities, State and Federal educational 
bulletins, and other educational periodicals. 
(7) Newspaper clippings on educational matters. 
(8) Results of researches and surveys. 
(9) Blank forms and sample records of other cities. 
(10) Inventory of equipment by schools. 
(11) Per capita cost of each school, department, kind of educational work, ete.

(12) Special file of net enrollment from January to December for city appropriation 
basis. 
The New Orleans idea of employing a ‘‘special investigator” is 
based upon conditions similar to those which have called forth the 
establishment of the efficiency bureau in Rochester. The functions 
of the city school department have become so inclusive, and its prob- 
lems so complicated and so varied, that there is ample room for men 
who will devote their entire time to study and research. At the same 
time modern educational science has grown so much in content, and 
modern educational endeavor is so diverse that no superintendent 
can be expected to attend to the duties of his office efficiently and 
expeditiously and find time to ‘‘keep up” with all the movements in 
school administration. It is just here that the trained ‘‘investigator” 
can, be of immense.service in weighing and measuring new ideas, in 
comparing conditions, in studying products, and can present to the 
superintendent and the school board, in carefully digested form, the 
results of his studies. 
Supt. Gwynn, of New Orleans, reports as follows: 
In order to secure standards for more effective measurement of schools and school 
activities, in May, 1918, the school board established a department of educational 
research. There has been placed in charge of this department a university professor 
who is a trained psychologist and trained in the methods of research. He is now 
employed by the board for his full time. He has been given clerical assistance and 
during the present school session attempts will be made through collection of data 
and giving of tests to establish different norms for the measurement of school efficiency. 
The department operates under the following rules: 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH. 
Section 1. Purposes. The aim of this department will be to extend the methods 
of scientific research to the various problems that arise in the administration of a 
city public school system. The specific activities of the department will be deter- 
mined by the needs and problems as they may appear. Among these specific prob- 
lems will be included vocational surveys for the guidance of trade and industrial 
education; standardization of tests and indices of school efficiency; extent and causes

106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Tn his last report, Supt. Spaulding, of Newton, Mass., makes the 
following statement on efficiency in school management: 
The progressive improvement of a school system demands that these essentials of 
scientific management be applied incessantly: The measurement and comparison of 
comparable results; the analysis and comparison of the conditions under which given 
results are secured—especially of the means and time employed in securing given 
results; the consistent adoption and use of those means that justify themselves most 
fully by their results, abandoning those that fail so to justify themselves. 
The measurement of measurable educational results by suitable standards need. 
limit those results to the dimensions of the standards no more than the measurement 
of a child’s height limits his growth to the dimensions of the yardstick. 
The city of Newton has no formally organized efficiency bureau, 
yet the annual report for 1912 well exemplifies the principles the 
superintendent has laid down with regard to the essentials of scien- 
tific management as applied to schools. 
The last Rochester report includes an exceedingly suggestive 
chapter descriptive of the activities of its efficiency bureau. The 
Newton report for 1912 is the best example of careful analysis of 
statistics and expenditures that has come to hand from any city not 
maintaining an efficiency bureau. 
IV. PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS. 
The reports of the work of efficiency bureaus will be awaited with 
much interest. Their function in part is that of a continuous survey. 
A single survey made by experts within or without a given school 
system can at most only set forth the historical development of the 
system, its present condition, and the direction in which it is moving. 
Often a survey sets forth only the second of these three items, namely, 
the present condition of the system examined. This, if carefully 
done, is often of great service to the community, but no single survey 
can perform the function of the continuous survey carried on by a 
permanent bureau within the system. 
This has been a notable year in respect to the number of surveys 
made, and it is evident that many more will be made within the next 
few years; but the need of a continuous survey within the system 
itself is not yet fully realized by school boards. There has been so 
much criticism of the schools, some fair and some unfair, that many 
school boards and the public which they represent, feeling some 
uncertainty as to the real condition of the schools for which they are 
responsible, naturally seek the best estimate they know how to 
command. 
Two years ago the National Council of Education took note of the 
increasing tendency to institute surveys and appointed a committee 
of five to study and report upon the question, ‘‘By what standards 
and tests may a school or a system of schools be judged?” The
-P-A-G-E-161
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 107 
report of this committee, made at the Philadelphia meeting in Feb- 
ruary, 1913, by its chairman, Prof. Strayer, led to the formation of 
a larger committee to continue the study of the problem. This 
committee numbers 15. The members are: Prof. George Drayton 
Strayer, Teachers College, New York, chairman; Prof. Paul Hanus, 
of Harvard University; Dr. F. E. Spaulding, superintendent of schools, 
Newton, Mass.; Dr. J. H. Phillips, superintendent of schools, Bir- 
mingham, Ala.; Miss Adelaide S. Baylor, assistant superintendent 
of schools, Indianapolis, Ind.; Dr. William H. Maxwell, city superin- 
tendent of schools, New York City; Prof. Edward L. Thorndike, 
Teachers College, Columbia University, New York; Prof. E. P. Cub- 
berley, Leland Stanford University, California; Prof. C. H. Judd, Uni- 
versity of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.; Hon. C. N. Kendall, commissioner 
of education of the State of New Jersey; Miss Katherine D. Blake, 
principal of public school No. 6, New York City; Mr. Ben Blewett, 
superintendent of schools, St. Louis, Mo.; Prof. E. C. Elliott, Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.; Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, super- 
intendent of schools, Chicago, Ill.; and Mr. James H. Van Sickle, 
superintendent of schools, Springfield, Mass. 
One of the first tasks undertaken by this committee was the formu- 
lation of principles which should guide in conducting school surveys. 
The principles adopted by the committee are as follows: 
A school inquiry should be described in such terms that the community will recog- 
nize that it is supplementary to the regular supervisory machinery in the schools. 
In general in the large systems it is best for the superintendent's office to secure from 
the board of education the necessary funds to maintain a bureau or department of 
special statistical information and special tests whereby the efficiency of the school 
system may be reviewed at all times in a way which will add to the routine reports 
and the routine observation possible under the usual organization that now exists. 
In small systems and in all systems on special occasions this will not be possible. 
Therefore other measures must be adopted. 
Where any special questions arise calling for expert knowledge which can not 
easily be supplied by the superintendent or school officials, as for example, in the mat- 
ter of architectural plans, in the matter of expert revision of accounting systems, 
and in cases where new and elaborate subjects are to be introduced into the curri- 
culum, as, for instance, industrial education, art education, and commercial educa- 
tion, the community should be led to recognize the fact that it is wise to bring in 
specialists who can advise the superintendent’s office and the board in these particular 
matters. Such specialists should make a careful examination of the whole com- 
munity, including the facilities which are offered for the special type of work that is 
needed, also discovering the difficulties, if any exist, in the introduction of the new 
subject. The survey in this case might be termed a general economic survey of the 
whole community with reference to a special school subject. 
Where the superintendent or the lay members of the school administration feel 
uncertainty with regard to any phase of the school work, it ought to be possible, with- 
out embarrassment to the officers of the school system, including the superintendent, 
to bring in competent persons who can supplement the routine observation of the 
schools and confirm or modify the recommendations that are under consideration. 
Such persons constituting a survey committee ought to be recognized by the com-  
-P-A-G-E-162
  108 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
munity as a temporary extension of the supervisory machinery of theschool. Inspecial 
cases a survey can be resorted to as a means of deciding points which are under dis- 
pute. Thus it is easily conceivable that several members of the board of education 
would not agree with regard to the wisdom of certain policies under consideration. 
They ought to be brought to recognize the value of advice from representatives of the 
educational profession outside the particular school system in question. The com- 
munity and the educational profession should be educated to recognize that consul- 
tation is not a reflection upon the efficiency of the superintendent, board of education, 
or members of the teaching staff, but rather a recognition of the teaching profession 
as a large and complex group, the members of which are capable of supplementing 
each other, even where there is not absolute agreement on methods of procedure. 
Temporary additions to the supervisory staff in the fashion above described are 
justified by the fact that schools are continually facing administrative emergencies 
for which it is not necessary to provide permanent additions to the staff. Furthermore, 
these temporary situations very frequently call for a broader view than can be supplied 
by asingle supervisory officer. The teaching profession itself needs the kind of oppor- 
tunity which would be furnished by such surveys to enlarge its own views and to try 
out many of the experiments which are necessary in order to secure the best adjust- 
ment within the complicated school situation. 
The superintendent very frequently needs the support of the general educational 
profession to make a community clearly aware of needs which he sees, but which the 
community is slow to recognize. For example, he frequently needs more funds than 
he can easily obtain without the cooperation of some outside advice for the benefit 
of the community itself. 
Finally, the community may be in doubt as to the efficiency of its school officers. 
When criticism has once become the fashion in a given community it is very likely 
to undermine the efficiency of the school system, and the superintendent ought to 
welcome some type of investigation which will either give him the support which he 
needs in dispelling the criticism or give the community the suggestions which it needs 
in order to cure the situation. 
From the above discussion it will be seen that a survey can be most advantageously 
initiated by the school officials. If the citizens wish to have a survey made, they 
ought to be able to secure it through their regular representatives on the board. Groups 
of citizens who can not get it through the board should be provided with means of 
carrying out a survey. Furthermore, the superintendent ought to be in a position 
at any time to call in impartial professional advisers in case he finds school interests 
seriously jeopardized. Whether the investigation originates with the superintendent 
or board or interested groups of citizens, its purpose should be to protect and advance 
the interests of the children and youth of the community. 
An inquiry will naturally aim to deal with those phases of school organization 
which are capable of exact objective review. Thus the financial management of the 
school should be taken up. The physical equipment of the school should be exam- 
ined. The attendance on schools, including the question of enforcement of the com- 
pulsory attendance laws, can be definitely known. The number of children in a given 
classroom should be ascertained; the provisions that are made for exceptional children, 
including defectives. 
The method of training teachers, their qualifications, the method of their appoint- 
ment, and the method of getting rid of inefficient teachers, should be investigated. 
Their salaries and the rules governing their tenure of office, the provisions that are made 
for the improvement of teachers during the period of their service, should also be 
investigated. 
The organization and functions of the supervisory staff and the efficiency with 
which they carry out their work, especially with reference to their contact with the 
classroom exercises.
-P-A-G-E-163
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 109 
The efficiency of instruction: This will include an examination of the course of 
studies and the time devoted to each one of the subjects in the course of study; the 
methods of class instruction, including the variations in these methods which are to 
be observed in the different parts of the system. There should also be made an exami- 
nation of the provisions which exist within the system for recording the individual 
history of children as they pass through the grades. 
Any report concerning school conditions should be so planned and arranged as not 
to mislead educational officers or the public concerning the general and special methods 
of any important feature of the work of the schools within its scope; for exampie, if 
the scope of the inquiry includes the work of the department of physical education, 
and if the physical growth of pupils is below what should be expected, while the 
moral and social atmosphere of the school playgrounds is admirable, the latter fact 
should be made as clear as the former. In general certain topics should be chosen 
for measurement and report, and the result should be reported in the case of each such 
topic without selection for purposes of the support of any interest within or without 
the school. 
Any school inquiry should, so far as is practicable, observe, measure, and report 
the conditions of the community’s political, industrial, social, and educational life 
which favor or interfere with the work of the schools. 
If the community can afford it, the survey should be made by a committee of two 
or more persons. This committee should invite and secure cooperation of the teaching 
staff. 
Investigators should dwell upon the achievements of the school system, especially 
noting the direction in which it is moving. 
The report should be prepared as a document intended for the information of the 
school officials. The further use of the report should depend upon the agreement 
of these school officials and the surveyor who is employed by the board. If the report 
is to be published, agreement should be reached in this matter at the time when the 
survey is first organized. In every case there should be an explicit understanding 
between the parties as to the method of treating the report. In the absence of sucha 
specific agreement before the report is prepared, publication should depend upon 
explicit agreement between the parties involved. 
Vv. SCOPE AND CHARACTER OF SURVEYS ALREADY MADE. 
Two educational surveys have been referred to in previous réports 
of this bureau, the Baltimore Survey, which was made in 1911, and 
the New York Survey, which has been completed during the present 
year. All of the city surveys so far made which are accessible will 
be briefly summarized. The descriptions which follow are based 
on statements prepared for the Committee of Fifteen on “Standards 
and Tests” by Prof. Charles H. Judd, the secretary of the committee. 
THE FIRST BOISE SURVEY. 
During one week in November, 1910, Supt. Calvin N. Kendall, at the request of 
the school board and the superintendent, made a survey of the schools of Boise, Idaho. 
The report was published in a local newspaper, the Idaho Statesman, on December 18, 
1910. It deals with (1) school buildings, (2) teachers, (3) course of study, (4) organiza- 
tion of schools, and (5) attitude of the community. The facts on which conclusions 
are based were collected through six days of personal observation: There are no 
tables in the report. Recommendations based on personal observation are made, 
and the report concludes with a brief statement by the superintendent to the effect
-P-A-G-E-164
110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
that board action was taken along the various lines recommended. The report is 
favorable and the recommendations are all in the direction of enlargement: Enlarge- 
ment of the staff; enlargement of the course, especially by including more industrial 
courses; enlargement of the organization by adding ungraded classes. The report 
is six pages in length. 
THE MONTCLAIR SURVEY. 
In May, 1911, Prof. Paul H. Hanus reported to the board of education of Montclair, 
N. J., on the schools of that city. The report deals with (1) general survey, (2) teach- 
ers and teaching, (3) program of studies in (a) elementary schools and (0) high schools. 
The report was printed in a pamphlet. The body of the report is 21 pages in length 
and contains numerous tables and-reports of personal observations, the latter appar- 
ently based on four days-of visiting in the schools. Criticisms are made in detail and 
numerous recommendations are made. 
The tables include: (1) A table of marks in the high school, comparing Montclair 
grades with those in other high schools; (2) a table of time distribution of subjects in 
grades, comparing Montclair and Newton, Mass.; (3) general tables of retardation, 
average ages and reasons for leaving school; for one school a full detailed table of ages 
and a table of nationalities. 
The recommendations on course of study are specific and detailed. The criticisms 
on general organization are based on the tables. The high school is criticized in its 
material equipment and in its course of study. 
Prof. Hanus notes explicitly at the end of his report that he has laid stress on what 
seemed to be the shortcomings of the Montclair schools and not on their many obvious 
merits. 
THE BALTIMORE SURVEY. 
In June, 1911, a commission consisting of Commissioner E. E. Brown, Prof. E. P. 
Cubberley, Supt. C. N. Kendall, with two assistants, namely, Messrs. N. B. Hillegasand 
Harlan Updegraff, rendered a report to the board of school commissioners ot the city 
of Baltimore on the schools of that city. The report was published as Bulletin No. 4, 
Whole Number 450, of the United States Bureau of Education. The body of the text 
contains 102 pages. A summary of 8 pages precedes the detailed tables and reports 
and presents the findings of the commission. The body of the report consists of five 
chapters. Chapter I (6 pages) describes the plan and history of the survey itself. 
Chapter II (26 pages) gives a history of the Baltimore school system and an outline 
of the social and legal relations of the system. Chapter III (44 pages) deals with the 
following topics: (a) System of supervision; (6) teaching force and its training; (c) 
the elementary curriculum. Chapter IV (10 pages) deals with the physical conditions 
in the schools. Chapter V (9 pages) deals with various general topics. 
The text includes numerous tables and charts. In many of these charts the Balti- 
more schools are compared with schools in the other leading cities of the United 
States. 
This report contains much matter dealing directly with the problems of adminis- 
tration and supervision and with the criticisms of the administration. It is evident 
from the whole tone of the report that the commission was expected to pass judgment, 
either favorable or unfavorable, upon the administration. 
In point of method it may be noted that comparison with other cities is much 
emphasized. Personal inspection is recorded as having been made in one-half of the 
schools and in 250 classrooms. The statement regarding the scope of the report is 
especially full and suggestive for the use of those engaged in the study of surveys 
(pp. 18-19). 
The report is fully indexed.

THE EAST ORANGE SURVEY. 
During the autumn of 1911 Prof. E. O. Moore prepared for the board of education 
of East Orange a report on the schools of that city. The report was printed in a pam- 
phlet of 64 pages early in 1912. Prof. Moore reports that he visited all of the classrooms 
in both elementary and high schools, talked with most of the teachers and super- 
vising officers, examined the pupils in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8, and consulted with citi- 
zens. The report contains the following sections: (1) Historical sketch; (2) relation 
of school to community; (3) board of education; (4) cost of schools; (5) general 
survey; (6) teachers; (7) a new course of study; (8) the high school; (9) summary 
of recommendations. The text contains tables, several comparing the schools of 
East Orange with those of other systems. The text is somewhat more general than 
that of other reports, making excursions into the general field of educational theory 
and urging conformity in the schools to the general principle that schools should 
train in thinking rather than in a set amount of subject matter. The report has the 
form of an appeal to the general lay reader, though in the discussion of many topics, 
such, for example, as the subjects of instruction, detailed descriptions of the desirable 
requirements are given. The tone of the report is not severely critical, though 
numerous recommendations for enlargement of the schools are made. 
HIGH SCHOOL NEEDS IN HARRISBURG, PA. 
In May, 1912, Dr. Henry Snyder, superintendent of schools in Jersey City, reported 
to the school board of Harrisburg the results of his inquiry into the high-school situa- 
tion in that city under the following points: 
(1) The present needs of a new high school; (2) whether there is need of one or two; 
(3) the location or locations; (4) the accommodations and facilities that should be 
provided to meet modern educational ideas and demands; (5) the probable cost of 
the project, not including sites and furnishings; (6) the probable length of time that 
such building or buildings will meet the high-school needs of the community. 
THE GREENWICH EXHIBIT. 
In June, 1912, the Russell Sage Foundation brought to its. consummation at Green- 
wich, Conn., an educational survey which is unique in its mode of presentation. 
The technical details of this survey are nowhere apparent. An educational exhibit 
was presented to the citizens of that city and a pamphlet of 24 pages was distributed. 
This pamphlet gives pictures, diagrams, and maps setting forth vividly the needs of 
improvement. There are pictures and charts which show the respects in which other 
school systems are superior to those of Greenwich. 
THE BRIDGEPORT SURVEY. 
During February, 1913, Supt. J. H. Van Sickle, of Springfield, Mass., reported to 
the board of education of Bridgeport, Conn., his findings on the schools of that city. 
The report is printed in a pamphlet of 129 pages. Mr. Van Sickle had the assistance 
of Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, of New York; Dr. H. 8. West, of Cincinnati; Mr. Wilbur F. 
Gordy, of Hartford; Dr. Andrew D. Edson, of New York; Mr. E. E. MacNary, of 
Springfield; Mr. E. Hebden, of Baltimore; and Mr. E. H. Webster, of Springfield. 
The report consists of (1) preliminary comments and recommendation (6 pages); 
(2) a financial study of the system (19 pages); (3) distribution of pupils (10 pages); 
(4) the city normal school (10 pages); (5) the high school (8 pages); (6) the indus- 
tries of Bridgeport and industrial education (16 pages); (7) special subjects: History, 
English, and a series of tests in arithmetic (47 pages). 
The report contains numerous comparative tables. It is based partly on obser- 
vations, partly on an analysis of comparative tables, and partly on the result of standard 
tests. It frankly emphasizes the points in which the schools are found to be defective,
-P-A-G-E-166
112 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
at the same time giving credit for good results achieved under adverse conditions, 
The demand for more investment of public funds in the schools is presented in such a 
way that the lay reader would be able to understand the comparisons. The rest of 
the report is more in the form of a technical report useful to school officers. The 
paragraphs on the industries and vocational education are full and emphatic and 
ought perhaps to be described as popular in form. They are based on a study of the 
local industries and industrial conditions. 
THE SECOND BOISE SURVEY. 
In February, 1913, a commission consisting of Profs. Edward ©. Elliott, Charles H. 
Judd, and George Drayton Strayer undertook at the request of the board of education 
of Boise, Idaho, a second survey of the schools of that city. The report is a pamphlet 
of 81 pages. The following are the section headings: (1) Scope of examination (half 
page); (2) the course of study (2 pages); (3) supervision (2 pages); (4) the teaching 
staff (2 pages); (5) classification and progress of children through the school system 
(3 pages); (6) parks and playgrounds (1 page); (7) the school plant (1 page); (8) 
expenditures (9 pages); (9) cooperation of the community with the public schools 
(2 pages); (10) report on instruction as observed. 
The report was based on material accessible in the office of the superintendent and 
on observation. There are comparative tables. In tone the report is commendatory, 
with numerous suggestions for enlargement of the school system. In form the report 
is intended for the lay reader. 
THE COHASSET SURVEY. 
In May, 1918, at the request of the school committee, Supt. F. E. Spaulding under- 
took a survey of the schools of Cohasset, Mass. The purpose of this survey was to aid 
the school authorities to make the Cohasset schools as good as the best in the State. 
The report, covering somiething more than 20 typewritten pages, has not been pub- 
lished. It contains recommendations for radical and far-reaching changes in the 
school system, from the kindergarten, not then in existence, through the high school. 
THE NEWBURGH SURVEY. 
The survey of the Newburgh public schools is a part of a survey of social conditions 
in Newburgh, N. Y., made by the Russell Sage Foundation and published in June, 
1913. The report is a pamphlet of 104 pages, 15 of which are devoted to schools. The 
following topics, under the heading ‘‘School credits and school needs’”’ gives a clear 
view of the scope of the survey, its spirit, and its plan. 
SCHOOL CREDITS. 
Among the things found worthy of special commendation are: 
I. A school board which has given, free of charge, much time and thought to school 
matters. 
II. An unusually fine school building—the Broadway School. 
III. Well-kept buildings, showing efficient janitor service. 
IV. But little class overcrowding, save in the academy. 
V. A well-equipped manual-training school. 
VI. The promise of installation of courses in domestic science. 
VII. A teaching force apparently devoted to its work. 
VIII. Good cooperation with parochial schools in the enforcement of the compulsory 
education law. 
SCHOOL NEEDS. 
I. Improvement of the physical provisions for children in the way of lighting, 
pence ventilation, cloak rooms, toilet facilities, and fire protection in old 
uildings. 
II. Placing the detailed work of school administration more largely in the hands of 
the superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-167
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, io 
III. More frequent and adequate advising with the teachers regarding textbooks, 
changes in the curriculum, daily and term programs, etc., and at the same 
time more thorough oversight of their work. 
IV. Increasing teachers’ salaries, and adopting better methods for their selection 
and promotion, and for studying and improving their efficiency. 
V. Making continuous studies of school efficiency for the purpose of locating and 
correcting weaknesses in the system. 
VI. Making special provision for mentally and physically abnormal children. 
VII. Establishing evening schools for foreigners and others who need special oppor- 
tunities. 
VIII. Greater provision for the physical training of children. 
IX. Opening school buildings out of school hours for wider civic and social uses. 
Comparisons are made between the expenditures for schools in Newburgh and other 
neighboring cities of similar size, and ingenious graphic illustrations are used which 
the layman can readily understand. . 
THE NEW YORK SURVEY. 
From time to time during this and the previous year sections of the report of this 
survey prepared by individual investigators have appeared under the title, ‘‘Interim 
Report.” 
The New York survey had its origin in the board of estimate and apportionment, 
through a resolution adopted by that body on October 26, 1910. The investigation 
was begun in June, 1911, under the direction of Dr. Paul H. Hanus, professor of the 
history and art of teaching in Harvard University. The list of assistants and quotations 
from Prof. Hanus’s conclusions of the report as a whole have been given in a previous 
report. (Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1912, Vol. I.) 
In showing what the schools should accomplish, Dr. Hanus suggests the usual pur- 
poses of public school education, and adds the following, which recent changes in our 
economic life have made desirable: 
Public education should strive to render each pupil economically intelligent and 
efficient. It should direct each pupil’s attention to a vocation to which he may 
reasonably aspire—that is, every pupil should be led gradually to realize that a suitable 
vocation, accessible to him and adapted to him, is indispensable to a useful and BEPDY. 
life. As he approaches the end of his school career, whatever his age may be, he 
should come to see that his vocation will be not only the means of satisfying his per- 
sonal wants and ambitions, but because it is the chief means of establishing significant 
relations between himself and his fellow men. It is also the source of such public 
service as he is capable of and may be called upon to render. Public education should, 
therefore, provide for the development of vocational purposes based on vocational 
enlightenment (vocational guidance); and it should offer each pupil appropriate 
training for the vocation of his choice. 
The following is the summary by the committee of school inquiry of the board. of 
estimate of the principal recommendations and constructive suggestions upon which 
the school investigators are generally agreed. This includes the ideas of the Hanus 
commission and Prof. Frank J. Goodnow and Dr. Frederic ©. Howe, who put in a sup- 
plementary report on organization and methods of the board of education. 
1. The course of study in all schools should be organized about human problems and 
made simple and elastic enough to permit differentiation to meet the needs of different 
nationalities and groups. 
2. The content of the course of study should be made as practical as possible, and 
special attention should be given to the development of commercial, industrial, and 
vocational subjects emphasizing the larger and more important aspects of industrial 
and commercial activities. 
3. The board of education should take necessary steps to effect the gradual elimina- 
tion of teachers of special branches. 
4, Each school as a neighborhood center should ally itself with neighborhood inter- 
ests and take cognizance of local needs. 
5. The board of education should make a careful investigation whether cosmopolitan 
or composite high schools offering several different courses of study or small high 
schools with differentiated curricula should be developed.

-P-A-G-E-168
    114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
6. The board of education, through the proposed bureau of investigation and appraisal or other bureau, should establish a fact basis for its educational, administra- 
tive, and financial work. 
7. The board of education’s attendance department should adjust its work so as to 
maintain discipline and control school attendance without resorting to police methods 
in checking truancy. 
8. The educational administrative work of the department of education should be 
reorganized. 
9. The board of education should carefully supervise the operation of heating and 
ventilating systems installed in the different public-school buildings. 
10. A comprehensive plan should be worked out for the wider use of school buildings 
for purposes of recreation, for public assemblage, and for civic and social gatherings. 
ll. The different administrative departments and bureaus of the department of 
education should be reorganized. 
12. The accounting system of the board of education should be so adjusted as to 
make possible the fullest segregation of disbursement accounts along functional lines, 
properly correlated with allied statistics, and their publication at least quarterly. 
13. The board of education should provide for the collection and tabulation of all 
current data needed in order to enable it to know in advance what additional seating 
capacity is actually required throughout the city. 
14. The permanent census board should be utilized by the board of education and 
should eventually be transferred to the board of education. 
15. The board of education should be reorganized and its membership reduced 
from 46 to 8, with 16 votes as now distributed in the board of estimate and apportion- 
ment. 
THE PORTLAND SURVEY. 
On the invitation of the board of directors of the Portland, Oreg., schools, a survey 
of the schools of that city was undertaken in April, 1913, under the general charge of 
Prof. Elwood P. Cubberley, of Leland Stanford University. Others who took respon- 
sible parts in it were: Supt. F. E. Spaulding, of Newton, Mass.; Supt. J. H. Francis, 
of Los Angeles; Dr. L. M. Terman, of Leland Stanford University; Dr. Fletcher B. 
Dresslar, of the United States Bureau of Education; and Prof. E. C. Elliott, of the 
University of Wisconsin. 
The resolution adopted by the Portland school board, under which the survey was 
conducted, is as follows: 
Whereas it is of the utmost un parance that the public schools should be kept at the 
highest point of efficiency, it is hereby declared to be the sense of this meeting that a 
full and complete survey be made of the public school system of this district, com- 
prising the location, type, character, and conditions of existing schoolhouses, and the 
estimated cost and type of future buildings; of the organizaton and method of admin- 
istration; of the form and manner of instruction; the courses of study and quality of 
text-books; the extent and need of school playgrounds and gymnasiums; the develop- 
ment of domestic science, manual training, trade, agricultural schools; the salaries of 
teachers and other employees; the method and system of accounting; the form of 
organization; and the examination of the school laws of the State as applied to this 
district; of the average cost per pupil in comparison with other large cities; and of 
the scientific method of raising the required revenue, either by direct taxation or by 
the issuance of bonds, or by both. 
The report has been completed, but at this date (November) copies are not yet 
available. 
THE KANSAS CITY SURVEY. 
‘An educational survey, with a view to simplifying and revising the entire curriculum 
of the Kansas City, Mo., schools, has been decided upon by the board of education. 
Authority has been given to Supt. I. I. Cammack and his assistants to conduct the 
survey. ; 
The first step was taken at the October meeting of the board, when it was decided 
to employ W. W. Charters, dean of the department of education of the University of 
Missouri, to superintend the revision of the study of language in all the city schools. 
A further survey of the entire course of studies of the schools is to be made by the 
superintendents and, in special instances, by experts employed from the outside.

Surveys Made by the New York Bureau of Municipal Research. 
1, THE SYRACUSE SURVEY. 
The survey of the schools of Syracuse is a part of a double survey of the department 
of health and the department of education made in May, 1912. The report is made 
to the associated charitiés of Syracuse and appeared in a typewritten manuscript of 
52 pages. The report deals with physical conditions, inadequacy of records, over- 
crowding of schoolrooms, and need of higher minimum and maximum salaries for 
teachers, the need of larger playgrounds, the need for more special classes, and the need 
of prevocational and industrial training. 
Purposive publicity is recommended and more extensive cooperation of outside 
civic interests with the schools. The report is organized to show (1) significant facts, 
and (2) constructive suggestions for correcting the defects noted in the preceding 
significant facts. 
2, THE WATERBURY (CONN.) SURVEY. 
The survey of the schools of Waterbury is a part of a survey of the organization and 
business procedure of all city departments made for a committee of business men by 
the New York bureau of municipal research in April, 1913. The three-day survey of 
the schools was made by Dr. Horace L. Brittain. A condensed statement of his 
findings, occupying 14 pages, is printed by the bureau. Four pages are devoted to 
conditions favorable to efficiency. These are discussed under the following heads: 
Administration, construction, and sanitation, textbooks and course of study, and 
outside cooperation. Six pages are devoted to defective conditions easily corrected 
by slight changes in administration. Three pages are devoted to defective conditions 
requiring increased appropriations, such as more adequate physical examination of 
children, remodeling buildings to insure safety and improve sanitary conditions, the 
need of facilities for technical instruction in high schools, clerical assistance to prin- 
cipals, etc. Statutory enactment, to give greater permanency to school board mem- 
bership is recommended. 
3. THE ATLANTA SURVEY. 
The survey of the schools of Atlanta is part of a double survey of the department 
of health and the department of education, made in December, 1912. The report is 
made to the chamber of commerce and appeared in a pamphlet of 44 pages, 24 of which 
refer to schools. The report on schools deals with the physical conditions, with 
administrative organization, and with observations or so-called ‘‘field observations” 
made in the schools. There are several tables on retardation, and examples of record 
sheets which are recommended. 
4, THE ST. PAUL SURVEY. 
The survey of public schools of the city of St. Paul was undertaken in February, 
1918, at the request of a committee of citizens, who defrayed the expenses of the sur- 
vey. The survey falls into three sections: (1) A section dealing with the financial 
records of the board of education and the disbursement of funds; (2) a section dealing 
with the organization of the office of the superintendent; and (3) a section dealing 
with the organization of instruction in the schools. The first section points out the 
difficulty of extracting from the present books of the board of education any accurate 
figures with regard to different types of instruction and the cost of different phases 
of the work of the schools, A series of detailed recommendations for changes in the 
accounting system was made, most of which are features of the system.of accounting 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
recommended by the Bureau of Education, The office of the superintendent is 
severely criticized because it is deficient in clerical assistance and because the physical 
conditions did not seem satisfactory to the surveyor. With regard to instruction, a 
series of concrete examples is given of poor work in the schools. The report after it 
was prepared was submitted to the board of education and was published in sections 
in the public press of the city. The report is an appeal to the citizens of St. Paul 
for very radical changes. 
SPECIAL INDUSTRIAL SURVEYS. 
The following surveys have been made, or are under way, with the purpose of dis- 
covering the relations which exist or which might be established between (a) school 
work, (6) the child or the youth who is about to enter into vocational life or in whom 
the vocational motive is clearly developing, and (c) the possible vocational oppor- 
tunities which are open to such child or youth: 
Cincinnati.—Through the Schmidlapp Bureau and its own system of granting work 
and schooling certificates and of requiring attendance in continuance schools, 
New York.—Through the vocation guidance survey, Miss Alice F. Barrows, director. 
Philadelphia —Through the public educational association, James S. Hiatt, secre- 
tary. See Report 1911-12, ‘‘A Year of Cooperative Service for the Schools,’’ and a 
paper by James 8. Hiatt, ‘The Child, the School, and the Job.” 
_ Cleveland.—The Cleveland chamber of commerce requested the Young Men’s 
Christian Association to establish an experimental vocational bureau. A general 
committee of citizens was formed and this committee determined to organize an “‘ insti- 
tute”’ of 100 members which should make a thorough investigation of the subject. 
Mr. Oscar M. Miller is secretary of the institute. 
At the same time a committee of the Schoolmasters’ Club of Cleveland and vicinity 
was appointed to recommend a plan for vocational guidance. This committe reported 
on April 12, 1913. The report emphasizes the necessity for gathering much more 
detailed information regarding actual needs and conditions. 
Buffalo—The Buffalo chamber of commerce determined to promote some plan for 
vocational guidance in Buffalo, and engaged Mr. Eli W. Weaver, of Brooklyn, N. Y., 
to conduct a survey in that city. 
Minneapolis.—A citizens’ committee representing philanthropic, manufacturing, 
labor, and educational interests, assisted by the Teachers’ Club, made a survey of 
352 boys and girls selected as representative of the children who left school four years 
ago and at that time were between 14 and 16 years of age. A trained investigator 
made a thorough canvass of the home and work conditions of these children, and of the 
personal progress and status of the children themselves. A report embodies the 
information secured and 10 recommendations. It was printed in the daily papers. 
VI. THE CONSULTING PSYCHOLOGIST. 
More than 20 years ago, at a meeting of the National Council of 
Education, Prof. Royce, of Harvard University, made a prediction 
which at the time seemed unlikely to be verified, namely, that the 
time would come when no school system would be regarded as prop- 
erly equipped to do its work without the employment of an officer 
whom he termed a “‘consulting psychologist.” Few who heard Prof. 
Royce on that occasion realized the need which he so clearly por- 
trayed, and his words were not taken overseriously by some of the 
superintendents present. But his prediction has come true, and 
one of the most significant tendencies in school management at the
-P-A-G-E-171
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. ETT 
present time is that toward a scientific inventory of the human 
material with which the teacher has to deal. Prior to 1900, school- 
attendance laws were either nonexistent or indifferently enforced. 
Children not fitted by mental constitution for school work as then 
organized early disappeared from the school enrollment and in that 
way ceased to be a problem to the school management. The school 
was a selective agency; it retained those who were by nature fitted 
to deal with abstractions, and it let the object-minded and .the 
mentally deficient drift away to obtain their preparation for life as 
best they might outside the school. Doubtless the improvement 
in compulsory-attendance laws, and their more rigid enforcement, by 
which varied types of intellect demand courses of study and methods 
of teaching to meet their widely varying needs, is in large measure 
responsible for this comparatively new movement in school admin- 
istration. For some years past, under varying names, this officer, 
termed by Prof. Royce a consulting psychologist, has been an indis- 
pensable assistant to the superintendent wherever employed. His 
work is sometimes organized into a department of child study, as in 
Chicago; a psychologic clinic, as in Salt Lake City and Los Angeles; 
or a psychological laboratory, as in Hartford, Conn., and Spring- 
field, Mass. But under whatever name this department is known, its 
function is practically the same. The head of the department is a 
trained psychologist. He deals with mental deviation from the nor- 
mal as the physician deals with physical deviation from the normal. 
He diagnoses the case and prescribes the remedy. Few school 
reports for the current year, issued in cities of 10,000 or more inhabi- 
tants, omit mention of provision for mentally exceptional children. 
Such children are often physically exceptional as well, and are in 
need of the services of the physician, the nurse, and the dentist. 
Quite generally throughout the United States children who are 
mentally or physically subnormal or morally delinquent are taken 
out of the regular classes and taught in more or less definitely clas- 
sified groups under conditions that promise most for their normal 
development. The names that are applied to these abnormal groups 
are so various as to be confusing. Standardization here is of im- 
portance in order that reports dealing with special classes may be 
understood. 
In September, 1913, the following designations for special classes 
were formulated in Philadelphia, in terms descriptive of the aim of 
the work rather than in terms of the characteristics of the children 
themselves: 
CLASSIFICATION AND GRADING OF PUPILS IN SPECIAL CLASSES IN PHILADELPHIA. 
As a result of the conferences on special class work held during the preceding year, 
it was decided that the designation of the special classes as ‘“‘disciplinary” and  
-P-A-G-E-172
    118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
“backward,” and that the grading of the pupils in terms of the eight elementary 
grades, is not satisfactory. 
Classification. 
In order that the special classes be designated by terms descriptive of the aim of 
the work, rather than in terms of the characteristics of the children themselves, the 
following classification has been adopted: 
Orthogenic (right mental development) classes (heretofore known as “‘Disciplin- 
ary” or ‘‘Backward’’). For pupils who can not proceed with the school work at 
normal pace, or for whom special adaptations of the curriculum must be made. 
Orthopedic (right physical development) classes. For crippled children whose 
physical disability makes special provision for them necessary or desirable. 
Open-window classes (formerly designated as ‘‘Anemic” or ‘‘Fresh air”). For 
pupils whose physical condition is such as to require special attention and treatment. 
Open-air classes (heretofore designated ‘‘Tubercular”). For children who are 
excluded from attendance in regular schools under section 3 of Rule IV of the board 
of public education. 
Grading. 
It has been further recommended that all children in special classes be graded as 
follows: 
Grade A will consist of pupils of low mentality who are held in school pending 
appropriate institutional provision. 
Grade B will contain pupils of a higher mental grade than Grade A, but who probably 
could not, with profit to themselves, be returned to the regular grades. The interests 
of these pupils will be best served by endeavoring to fit them, through manual training, 
for industrial life. 
Grade C will contain—(a) Retarded pupils who are to be restored, if possible, to the 
regular grades. 
(6) Those who are able to do the work of the regular grades, but who, by reason of 
moral delinquency, should not be permitted to return to them. They should remain 
here until better provision can be made for them. 
It must be evident that the proper classification of exceptional 
children requires professional skill of a high order. The very 
terms used in Philadelphia to describe the aim of the work suggest 
the services of a trained psychologist working in cooperation with 
the school physician and the nurse.

tory follows:

VII. THE VISITING TEACHER. 
Given the consulting psychologist with a laboratory properly 
equipped and a file of his records of cases, how shall his recommen- 
dations get carried out? .There are at least three ways, and they 
may all be found in operation, singly or in combination; the written 
or printed communication is not very effective in getting things done 
in any home; the regular teacher has duties that preclude giving 
enough of her time in calls to get results; the visiting teacher is the 
one person who can fully meet the situation. In Rochester, N. Y., 
such a teacher is employed by the school board; and in Hartford, 
Conn., and Springfield, Mass., she works under the direction of the 
superintendent of schools; in Boston under the auspices of the Ellis 
Memorial Settlement. The public education association of New 
York quotes the city superintendent as saying in his last report that 
the board of education was so impressed with the work of the visit- 
ing teachers furnished by the association that it asked the board of 
estimate and apportionment to appropriate $25,000 to take over and 
extend the service. The appropriation was refused, but the work is 
continued. In Rochester the function of the visiting teacher is thus 
defined: 
The appointment of a visiting teacher is an attempt on the part of the school to 
meet its responsibility for the whole welfare of the child. There are few of the chil- 
dren in our schools who are suffering through the willful neglect and abuse of parents. 
Whatever suffering comes for which the home is responsible, comes largely through 
ignorance or necessity. It will be the function of the visiting teacher to enlighten 
and to aid in relieving. Her field will be restricted to the girls. Her aim will be to 
secure the maximum cooperation between the home and the school. Through such 
a teacher the school is by no means usurping, but it is rather stimulating and encourag- 
ing the home to meet to the limit of its power its full share of the responsibility for 
the welfare of the child. 
  
1 Miss Studley is the visiting teacher.
-P-A-G-E-174
  120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In New York the services of the visiting teacher are summarized 
thus: 
The visiting teacher, carefully selected for her qualities of tact, judgment, and 
social training, stands at the teacher’s right hand with the time and the equip- 
ment to work out adjustments between home and school. She completes the school 
staff and is an important factor in insuring to each little child in New York the full 
opportunities of education. 
In Springfield the visiting teacher works in close cooperation with 
Dr. George E. Dawson, the director of the psychological laboratory. 
Thus far her work has been fourfold: The consideration of candi- 
dates for examination by Dr. Dawson; the following up of such candi- 
dates after examination according to recommendations made; the 
study of cases not properly needing Dr. Dawson’s examination, yet 
in which the child is a problem that belongs neither to the attendance 
officer nor the school nurse; and the preparation of a system of record 
keeping. Notification of cases needing the attention of the visiting 
teacher is made by means of this blank:

Vill. THE HEALTH OF SCHOOL CHILDREN, 
Late reports indicate the almost universal existence of health 
supervision in the school systems of the country. Mere inspection 
to guard against the spread of communicable disease, while regarded 
as highly important, is no longer the sole aim of the school physician.
-P-A-G-E-176
    122 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The school nurse is not everywhere employed, but the school sys- 
tems in which both physician and nurse are found are too numerous 
to be listed in a report of this kind. Many cities provide a dental 
~ clinic; some on the basis of volunteer services of dentists, and others 
on a more certain and permanent basis. Sacramento, Cal., is the 
only city heard from in which the employment of the school dentist 
preceded that of the school physician and the school nurse. The 
employment of dental nurses is now advocated in connection with 
the clinic as a less expensive scheme for a city and more effective 
than the clinic alone, because more children can be reached, and if 
children’s teeth are always kept clean, decay does not set in. The 
board of education of Bridgeport, Conn., has made provision for an 
experimental dental clinic on advanced preventive and educational 
lines. The plan involves actual surface treatment of children’s 
teeth once a month by a dental nurse. An appropriation of $5,000 
has been made, by means of which the plan is to be tried in one 
school. In this one school the teeth of those children in the first 
five grades whose parents are too poor to pay for dental service 
will be filled by the graduate dentist in charge. No doubt bad 
health, due in part to bad teeth, is responsible to a large extent for 
the slow progress of many children in their studies. The human 
mechanism can not reach its full efficiency unless all of the parts are 
in good working order, and more and more are school boards plan- 
ning to give the child’s body the first consideration instead of the 
last. This is seen also in the wide vogue of the open-air school for 
children of low vitality, and the partially heated open-window room 
for the less pronounced cases as well as for children in a normal state 
of health. As generally managed, the only difference between the 
ordinary classroom and the open-window room is that in the latter 
the windows are kept open in all weathers. There is no modifica- 
tion of the school program in the case of the open-window room; 
it is merely a successful attempt to improve school conditions for 
the normal child. 
The open-air school, on the other hand, is practically the same 
everywhere. It is designed for children handicapped by physical 
weakness, children whose needs are greater than those of normal 
children. The successful treatment of the anemic child, predis- 
posed to tuberculosis, depends on more than fresh air, though that 
is a vital factor. He must have during the school day plenty of 
nourishing food, a period of absolute relaxation, and a freedom from 
restraint that is incompatible with large classes in indoor school- 
rooms. In the open-air schools, therefore, each teacher has charge 
of about half as many children as are assigned to the ordinary school- 
room, and three meals are served to the pupils daily between the 
hours of 8.45 a.m. and 4 p.m. Each child is supplied with a cot,
-P-A-G-E-177
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 123 
upon which he takes his noonday rest, two army blankets, and felt 
boots for use in very cold weather. Shower baths are administered 
under the direction of the visiting physician. The program makes 
liberal provision for physical exercise and free play, and in general 
the children enjoy a greater degree of freedom than is possible under 
the ordinary school conditions. 
The objection is offered that feeding school children is not a legiti- 
mate tax upon the State. In Massachusetts, public sentiment is so 
far in favor of the movement for open-air schools that a referendum 
was provided for by legislative enactment last winter by which any 
community may decide to furnish food to children at public expense. 
This sort of school is expensive, but not many open-air schools are 
needed in any city. <A city of 100,000 inhabitants might to advan- 
tage maintain two or possibly three. The open-window school, on 
the other hand, may be multiplied indefinitely without added ex- 
pense, for it is a neighborhood school. The children are within 
walking distance of it, and they go home to their meals. Usually 
some heat is supplied in the coldest weather, enough to maintain a 
temperature of 50° or 60°. Rain or snow may be kept out by 
means of cheesecloth tacked over the open upper half of the window 
frame. The chief obstacle to the wider use of the open-window 
plan seems to be the objection of the few. It is not a question that 
can be decided by majorities. If 39 parents approve and one 
objects, the windows must remain closed unless the child of the 
objector can be transferred without loss of grade, an adjustment 
not always easy to make. The utility of our expensive heating 
systems, with their elaborate provision for forced ventilation, is 
being seriously questioned in these days by not a few architects and 
engineers of repute, yet the average parent hesitates to give his 
assent when the teacher proposes to throw open the windows and 
let the air in. 
HOME STUDY. 
It is reported that Boston has lengthened the school day for the 
grades below the high school one-half hour, this extra period to be 
devoted to the preparation of lessons for the next day, the purpose 
being to reduce home study to a minimum. In Newark, N. J., all 
required study is done at school. In the schools of Bridgeport, 
Conn., there is no required home study. The period devoted to a 
given study is systematically divided between preparation and 
recitation. During the first half of the period the children study 
the lesson for the following day, and during the second half of the 
period they recite the lesson learned the day before. 
Many of the reports which have been received speak of the empha- 
sis now placed on teaching children to study and the growing tendency
-P-A-G-E-178
  124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
to have more work done by the children within school hours. It is 
pointed out that the requirement of school study at home has highly 
magnified the difference in home conditions of young people. Stu- 
dents from cultured homes, supplied with books of reference and 
with opportunity to be alone during the home-study period, have a 
great advantage over young people from homes in which there are 
no such aids. In study periods at school, all students are on an 
equal footing as to conditions for work. Of course no one forbids 
home study. The extent of the movement in question seems to be 
to teach how to study, to encourage the preparation of all lessons 
in school time, and not to make home study a requirement. The 
general reduction in the number of pupils assigned to a single teacher 
favors the climination of home study or at least a reduction in the 
amount required. 
The school board of Boston has fixed the appointment of teachers 
on the basis of one teacher for every 42 pupils in the first grade 
and 44 in other grades. A few years ago the usual number of children 
assigned to a single room in that city was 56. The reduction of the 
size of classes in elementary schools elsewhere has exceeded that in 
Boston. Out of 182 cities reporting, 35 have made a reduction in 
the size of classes within the year. 
There is no marked tendency toward lengthening the school year. 
Kankakee reports an increase from 38 weeks to 40 weeks, while 
Richmond, Ind., reports a reduction from 38 weeks to 36. Other 
cities of the 182 reporting say ‘‘no change.” The all-year school is 
advocated in educational meetings and may become a regular feature, 
but at present Newark, N. J., appears to furnish the only example. 
Newark’s favorable experience with the all-year school was a feature 
of the commissioner’s report for the year 1912. In these days 
when the wider use of school buildings is being advocated, it would 
not seem too great an innovation to provide regular schooling for 
those who want it during the summer months. In Massachusetts 
and some other States the labor laws enforce idleness in July and 
August, when in the opinion of many thoughtful people either 
remunerative employment or school attendance would improve both 
health and habits. 
Supt. Poland writes: 
Iam still of the opinion that our school year is altogether too short for a large number 
ot children, who are better off in school than on the streets of a crowded city with no 
other employment than the street affords. The school year of 40 weeks is long enough, 
perhaps, for the majority of boys and girls who do not need to make haste to get into 
harness, but for others who should begin the work of bread winning as early as their 
strength and health will permit, the all-year school is a Godsend. 
The two all-year schools which were established in the Seventh Avenue and Bel- 
mont Avenue school buildings in 1912 have been successfully maintained during 
the past year. Started as an experiment, almost if not the first of the kind in the
-P-A-G-E-179

country, their success was watched with considerable interest by educators else- 
where as well as at home. 
The difficulties encountered, so far, in adjusting the all-year plan to schools of the 
usual type have not been found to be insuperable. On the contrary, it is quite 
plain that the administration of both types of school, the old and the new, in the 
same building, by the same teachers, can be readily accomplished. 
In general, the second year’s experience in the organization and operation of these 
schools has been highly satisfactory and warrants their increase in number as soon 
as possible, especially in the congested districts of the city, where there is a large 
foreign population. The additional two months of schooling made possible in the ~ 
all-year school appeal strongly to these people who are unable to keep their children 
in school for many years. 
IX. INSTRUCTION IN HYGIENE. 
The Fourth International Congress on School Hygiene, held in 
Buffalo in August, revealed the fact that we are only at the beginning 
of the movement for safeguarding the health of school children. 
The program of the congress divided itself up into six general 
sections, each of which held from two to five sessions. Roughly 
these were: (1) School buildings and their sanitation, including 
design and equipment, ventilation, heating and cleaning, and open-air 
schools; (2) The status and methods of instruction in hygiene; (3) 
The hygiene of instruction, including mental hygiene and the treat- 
ment of mentally abnormal children; (4) Medical, hygienic, and 
sanitary supervision in schools, including medical inspection, school 
nurses and clinics, causes and handling of physical defects and disease, 
conservation of vision, oral hygiene, school feeding, tuberculosis; (5) 
Physical education; and (6) Special aspects of school hygiene, 
especially relations to home and community, school lunches, child 
labor, club women’s cooperation, etc. 
In view of the movement toward the teaching of sex hygiene.in the 
schools, the discussion of this subject was of more than ordinary 
interest, but no solution of the problem proposed at the congress met 
with general approval. Opinion was sharply divided. Prof. Tierney 
argued that the details of sex instruction should be eliminated from 
school instruction, and that the entire emphasis be placed on purity 
by definite character training. ‘The appeal is to the wrong faculty, 
the emphasis in the wrong place.’ ‘Sex instruction is apt to put 
forward by some years the time of suggestion and temptation. Safety 
lies in diverting the attention from sex details.’ His conclusions 
were that the home is the proper place for sex instruction. It is 
along this line that several cities have moved. The Cleveland plan 
is simple and workable, but it does not reach all homes. In the 
evening, at certain public-school buildings, a woman physician, 
tactful and well qualified, presents the subject to such mothers as are 
interested; and at the same buildings at other evenings, a male 
physician speaks to the fathers. These meetings have been largely
-P-A-G-E-180
  126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
attended. They constitute a part of the public lecture system. The 
same plan, is in operation in New Orleans and Chicago. In addition 
to providing lectures on sex hygiene for adults, the board of educa- 
tion of Chicago now provides instruction on this subject for boys and 
girls in the high schools. On July 9, 1913, the board appropriated 
$10,000 to be used in payment for a course of three lectures on 
“personal purity,” to be delivered to boys and girls in the high 
. schools of Chicago. These lectures were begun on October 27 and 
will be completed in all of the high schools by November 26. Men 
physicians are delivering the lectures to the boys, women physicians 
to the girls. These physicians were selected by the superintendent 
of schools, and their names are submitted to the board of education 
for approval. The possibility of introducing the work in the upper 
grammar grades is under consideration. 
XK. THE COURSE OF STUDY. 
According to reports at hand, courses of study are this year receiv- 
ing more than usual attention. Some revision seems to be in progress 
everywhere. After the perusal of the paragraphs referring to 
revision, either made or contemplated, certain impressions stand 
out prominently: First, the teaching force is contributing toward 
the working out of the course of study; second, the revision 
in the elementary field, now often limited to six grades, involves 
much elimination of nonessential material; and third, the additions 
to the course appear chiefly in the upper grades and are more largely 
vocational than cultural. 
Several reports speak of the help rendered by committees of 
teachers in revising the course of study. The foreword of the Minne- 
apolis course, issued in 1913, may serve as a type: 
In the spring of 1911, a committee of 20 principals was appointed by the superin- 
tendents to make suggestions as to a new course of study and the organization and 
administration of the city schools. After a year’s work, courses in the various sub- 
jects were agreed upon and recommended to the superintendent with suggesied 
changes in textbooks. These courses were referred by the superintendent to his 
assistant and the supervisor of primary work for editing. With such correlation as 
the courses permitted and such modifications as were necessary and desirable and 
agreed to by the subcommittees of the committee of 20, this course of study was 
reported by the superintendent to the board and adopted June 11, 1912. 
The aim constantly in mind in the preparation of this course has been to recognize 
the new social values of the subject matter and the psychological development of the 
child. 
In June, 1913, teachers and principals were asked to make written comments based 
upon the year’s trial of the course. These criticisms and suggestions were discussed 
at conferences with various groups of teachers. As a result such substitutions, 
eliminations, and rearrangements were made as to adapt better the course to the 
needs of the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-181
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 127 
Other typical statements are: 
Grand Rapids, Mich.: A new course of study has been prepared through the coopera- 
tion of the principals and teachers of the school system. The elaboration of the course 
of study was intrusted to five committees. These reports will be printed as reports 
of the committees on the several subjects. These reports are not yet printed, but 
will be ready for distribution within a few months. 
Jackson, Mich.: A general revision of the course of study has been begun. Super- 
visors and teachers are called upon by the superintendent for assistance. 
Canton, Iil.: Course of study now being revised by committees of teachers working 
with superintendent. 
Paterson, N. J.: The course of study in history was revised by a committee of prin- 
cipals following the plan laid down by the committee of eight. 
VOCATIONAL STUDIES. 
The strongest tendency in education to-day is that toward voca- 
tional training. This has been pushed by all classes, especially by 
business men and social workers outside the schools, and many 
within the schools, to meet two urgent needs—the demand for more 
skilled workers and to save the human waste in the industrial world. 
That which was supported by private charity, by private philan- 
thropy, by some business houses and manufacturing concerns, and 
by some public-school systems has begun to receive the support of 
many of the States. As a result, vocational schools, part-time 
arrangements with local industries, and industrial departments in 
the regular schools have been established. New Orleans has just 
opened a trade school for girls and Saginaw one for both sexes. The 
following notes on the Saginaw school are taken from the minutes of 
the May meeting of the Saginaw school board: 
In order to be of the greatest service to this community there will be: 
(1) A day school—To prepare youth of both sexes for efficient industrial citizenship 
through the teaching of a definite trade. 
(2) A continuation school—To give boys and girls between 14 al 18 years of age, 
who are already engaged in a trade, an opportunity to complete their general school 
education and also to improve their theoretical and practical knowledge of their trade. 
(3) A night school—To help men and women engaged in a vocation to better their 
conditions by increasing their knowledge and skill. 
In order to meet these conditions the school will be open all the year round and 
every day from 8 to 11.30 a. m., from 1 to 3.30, from 4 to 6, and from 7 to 9 p. m.; 
holidays will be observed according to law, and Saturdays the school will close at 12 m. 
Sixteen communities in Massachusetts are now maintaining day 
industrial or vocational schools under the supervision of the State 
board of education. They are Beverly, Boston, Hadley, Harwich, 
Lawrence, Lowell, New Bedford, Newton, Northampton, North- 
boro, Petersham, Quincy, Somerville, Springfield, Westfield, and 
Worcester. The State pays one-half the running expenses of these 
schools,
-P-A-G-E-182
  
128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In Holyoke an all-day industrial school was begun September 2, 
1918, and a cooperative industrial course (Fitchburg plan) added in 
the high school. 
Among the States giving aid to vocational schools New York is 
prominent. Under the new law signed by the governor May 26, 1913, 
public vocational schools are under the management and control of 
the local school authorities. However, since the State contributes 
very liberally to the support of such schools (paying two-thirds of 
the salary of the first teacher and one-third of the salary of every 
additional teacher in each school for day, evening, and part-time 
classes), it reserves large authority for itself in certification of teachers, 
specification and approval of accommodations, equipment, courses 
of study, and size of classes. 
Under the provisions of this law Buffalo is operating a large number 
of vocational and prevocational schools for boys and girls in prepara- 
tion for the great variety of occupations open to them in that city. 
What is true of Buffalo is true in a measure of all large industrial 
cities throughout the country, though not all have State cooperation 
as in Massachusetts and New York. 
It would be highly interesting to compare the Wisconsin scheme 
of vocational education under the plan of separate administrative 
control with the State cooperation plan of New York and Massa- 
chusetts, but it is yet too early to make the comparison. 
DIFFERENTIATION OF COURSES. 
The movement toward differentiation of courses at the close of 
the sixth grade has been greatly accelerated by the general interest 
in industrial education. Reports indicate that, the number of cities 
in which the elementary course, alike for all, ends with the sixth 
grade is increasing rapidly year by year. This is a return to the 
older ideas in effect as far back as 1860. In that year in an address 
to the teachers and citizens of New Haven, Conn., as superintendent 
of schools, Dr. Daniel C. Gilman refers to the period of elementary 
education as covering about six years. He speaks of it as a fact that 
no one questions that the child will pursue elementary studies from 
the age of 6 or 7 to the age of 12 and 13, and that he will then either 
begin his preparation to enter upon a trade or will take up secondary 
school studies at this point. 
In the years intervening since 1860, the elementary curriculum 
has been greatly extended, two years’ work having been added. We 
are now cutting through the grades at the place of differentiation 
established over 50 years ago, and from the sixth grade on are offer- 
ing three lines of work—the old-line academic, the commercial, and 
industrial. In these days children are not wanted in the trades till 
they are 16 years of age; hence we establish prevocational and
-P-A-G-E-183
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. : 129 
vocational schools in which boys and girls who must early become 
wage earners may learn the elements of occupations and trades while 
continuing their academic education. Such schools also serve as 
agencies for vocational guidance. In the prevocational school the 
boy gains experience in the use of a variety of tools which he uses in 
manipulating material of various sorts. Thus he gains an industrial 
experience that helps him to find out for what line of work he has 
the greatest aptitude. The vocational school will give him further 
training in his chosen occupation and enable him to enter upon the 
trade of his choice with the best possible prospect of advancement. 
The Tacoma plan of preparing children of elementary school age 
for industrial efficiency is applicable to— 
Those pupils who are likely to be compelled to earn their own way as soon as they 
become 15 years of age. 
Those who are mechanically inclined; that is, those who are planning to follow a 
trade. 
Those whose needs seem not to have been met by the grade work and who desire a 
course of study which will give them more manual training or home economics. 
These courses are open to any boy or girl who has completed successfully the work 
of the sixth A class and whose parent or guardian makes a written request that the 
pupil be permitted to take the prevocational courses, provided that the principal of 
_ the school last attended recommends the pupil for this work. 
Membership in these courses is limited to 50 pupils in each center, 25 boys and 25 
girls. Pupils will be admitted in the order in which their applications are received. 
If more than 50 applicants are received for work in either center, they will be placed 
on file, and pupils will be admitted in the order of their applications. 
These courses provide separate classes for boys and girls. The school day begins 
at 9 and closes at 11.45 for the morning session, and begins at 1 and closes at 3.25 for 
the afternoon session. One-half of each day will be devoted to manual training or 
home economics. The other half of the day will be devoted to the following com- 
mon branches: Arithmetic, language, penmanship, spelling, hygiene, history, or 
geography. 
The work covered in the common branches will correspond somewhat to the seventh 
and eighth grades of the regular grammar-school course and will require two years 
for its completing. Pupils who wish to continue their school work may enter the 
Tacoma high schools upon an equal footing with pupils entering from the regular 
school course. 
The type of vocational school maintained in Massachusetts may 
_ be understood by reference to the following description of the Spring- 
field Vocational School. However, not all the vocational schools in 
Massachusetts are alike, as much latitude is left to the local authori- 
ties in fashioning the school curriculum; and while the State agents 
have definite recommendations to give, if the school as established 
meets their approval it will receive State aid. 
The Springfield Vocational School is designed for boys over 14 years of age enrolled 
in the upper grammar grades. The local school board is the administrative head of 
the school, but in addition it is required by the State that an advisory board, com- 
posed of men engaged in the industries that are represented in the school, be ap- 
17726°—xp 1913—voL 1——9
-P-A-G-E-184
  
130 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
pointed to confer and advise with the school board, the principal, and teachers of 
the school. : 
Instead of giving each boy a half day of shopwork and a half day of class work in 
succession, the work is carried on in what is called the “job” or “project” plan. 
The boys of each group are given one day a week of special classroom work that is 
related tothe shopwork. Fortheremainder of the week their workis confined entirely 
tothe ‘‘job.’”” Each job requires an assigned amount of estimating, drawing, writing 
of specifications, shop notes, and cost records, as well as shopwork. Each step is 
taken up in order and is carried through until it is finished. Instead of dividing 
the day up into periods for each type of work, as is true in the other schools, the boy 
continues at each required step until it is finished. This is typical of the conditions 
the boys will meet in the industries, where they must continue all day without a 
very great change in the type of activity. Before a boy can go to the shop to execute 
the job, he must complete all written work, drawing, and estimating. This require- 
ment is an incentive for serious application, and gives conditions so real that this 
part of the school work has shown very great improvement over results under the 
former half-day plan. 
All of the shopwork is of the industrial type. No exercises have been used. The 
work has consisted of orders for the shop equipment or for other school departments. 
Now the school is allowed to take orders for standard articles, charging market rates 
for the product, and sharing the proceeds with the boys on an equitable basis. The 
aim has been to give present-day industrial practice. 
The boys get their instruction in formal work from a man who is experienced as a 
class teacher; their work in specifications, drawing, and estimating, from men who 
in training are midway between the shop man and the class teacher; their shop in- | 
struction from a thoroughly practical mechanic. 
THE TEACHING OF THRIFT. 
The collecting and accounting of the penny savings of school 
children has come to be an important feature in many schools. As 
conducted in some school systems, however, it requires an expendi- 
ture of time on the part of the teacher out of proportion to the good 
results achieved; and the principal’s part in the work often requires 
time that can ill be spared from supervision. Three plans have been 
received that have much to commend them on the score of simplicity 
and pupil responsibility. They have elements of decided educa- 
tional value. 
In the high school of Hutchinson, Kans., a “Student Activity 
Bank” has been organized. 
Two principal purposes were in view in the establishment of this bank. One was 
to have a convenient and satisfactory method of handling the funds of the various 
student organizations, and the other was to make the work of the department conform 
as nearly as possible to actual business conditions and problems as the students will 
meet them when out of school. A voucher system was devised and put into use the 
requirements of which provide that all purchases made for any student organization 
using this bank must be approved by the student manager of the organization and 
also by the faculty adviser or manager of that organization, the check for the payment 
of the purchases being kept by the bank, and the bank also keeping a careful account 
of the funds of the organization. By resolution of the board of education the funds 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 131 
of all high-school student activities are in the future to be handled through this bank 
by the voucher system. It is believed that this will result in a more satisfactory 
accounting of the funds of the various organizations. As students in the department 
do the most of the actual work of keeping the books and accounts, but under the 
supervision of the head of the department, the students are given training in actual 
business transactions involving the handling of cash and various business papers. 
Thus actual experience of the most practical kind possible is given the students as a 
part of their regular school work, an experience and training in exactly the kind of 
work these people expect to do after finishing their high-school course. 
In 1912, by recommendation of the superintendent, the board of 
education in Leavenworth, Kans., made bank savings a part of the 
course of study. The recommendation made by the superintendent 
to the board, and adopted by it, was: 
(1) That a banking transaction must take place between the bank and the child, 
if the greatest good was to be obtained from the endeavor. 
(2) The teacher should noé enter into the transaction. 
(3) An organized effort made by principals and teachers in teaching savings. Out- 
lined matter sent out by superintendent. Taught in regular class work. 
(4) Bank opened in each building in the hall or in the principal’s office. Hour, 
8.30 a.m. Bank clerk present with deposit slips, etc. 
(5) A regular schedule for each bank. No advertising. 
The Ann Arbor, Mich., public schools have two unique features 
in connection with their school savings system. The stamp plan, 
with folders, is in use. The students in the commercial department 
of the high school act as messengers for-collection of savings in the 
various schools. They are assigned to duty for specified periods by 
the head of the commercial department and are required to count 
and record the savings of the schools to which they are sent and to 
bring them to the high school. 
When the system was established, the board of education could 
not agree on a bank that would have control of all the deposits and 
an arrangement was agreed upon so that a folder filled with stamps 
(50 one-cent stamps) might be deposited in any local savings bank 
and accepted in the local clearing house as a check on the savings 
deposits which were in a separate account in the bank that held 
other school moneys. In this way pupils may open a savings account 
in the bank of their choice, and the banks find it wise to be agree- 
able to their young patrons who are to be the business men and 
women of the community in a few years. 
XI. VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
As yet the prevocational school and the vocational school, as 
agencies for vocational guidance, reach only the few. Various plans 
for reaching all who need guidance have been proposed, but the 
work is new and large results can not be claimed with assurance.   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
What is done in various places may seem crude and awkward, but 
the movement has great possibilities and already it has done the 
important thing of drawing some attention from the subjects of the 
curriculum to direct attention toward the boy and girl, with the 
excellent result that the need of considering their individualities is 
felt. 
The Middletown (Conn.) high school endeavors to aid its students 
in finding suitable employment. The card to be filled by the pupil 
applying for work is here reproduced:

Grand Rapids is the only city known to the writer in which a sys- 
tematized scheme of vocational guidance is worked out under the 
control of the board of education. This guidance is given, beginning 
with the seventh grade and extending through the high school, and 
is developed in connection with the work in English: 
GRAND RAPIDS. 
A brief statement of the aim of the work in each grade is given, beginning with the 
seventh and extending through the twelfth. 
Seventh grade: 
Theme: Vocational Ambition. 
Purpose: To arouse within the pupil a desire to be somebody and something 
worth while in the world. 
Eighth grade: 
Theme: The Value of an Education. 
Purpose: To impress upon the pupil the need and means of obtaining some 
further preparations for life than that of the grammar grades of the 
public schools.
-P-A-G-E-187
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 133 
Ninth grade: 
First semester— 
Theme: The Elements of Character That Make for Success in Life. 
Purpose: To draw out an understanding of real success in life and how it is 
obtained, and to apply the fundamental lessons of character 
building to the needs of each pupil. 
Second semester— 
Theme: Vocational Biography. 
Purpose: To continue the same lessons from the lives of successful men and 
women in varied fields of endeavor. 
Tenth grade: 
First semester— 
Theme: The World’s Work. 
Purpose: To study vocation in general in order that the pupil’s vision of the 
call to service may be as broad as possible. 
Second semester— 
Theme: Choosing a Vocation. 
Purpose: To attempt to select that vocation or general field of occupation 
for which the pupil by self-analysis seems best fitted. 
Eleventh grade: 
First semester— 
Theme: Preparation for Life’s Work. 
Purpose: To plan out a definite course of study and conduct to meet the 
special requirements of the profession, business, or industry 
chosen. 
Second semester— 
Theme: Vocational Ethics. 
Purpose: To study the moral problems peculiar to the chosen business, pro- 
fession, or occupation. : 
Twelfth grade: 
First semester— 
Theme: Social Ethics. 
Purpose: To study the relation of the individual in his future vocation to 
society. 
Second semester— 
Theme: Civic Ethics. 
Purpose: To study the relation of the individual in his future vocation to 
the State. 
The movement for vocational guidance has attained such propor- 
tions that the propaganda has its own organization known as the 
Vocational Guidance Association. This association met with the 
National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education at Grand 
Rapids, October 19 to 25, 1913. The object of the association accord- 
ing to its constitution is: 
To promote intercourse between those who are interested in vocational guidance; 
to give a stronger and more general impulse and more systematic direction to the 
study and practice of vocational guidance; to establish a center or centers for the dis- 
tribution of information concerning the study and practice of vocational guidance and 
to cooperate with the public schools and other agencies in the furtherance of these 
objects.

  134 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
CREDIT FOR HOME WORK. 
School men have for several years bemoaned the fact that modern 
city conditions make it impossible for boys and girls to receive that 
practical preparation for life which the country home of to-day and 
the urban home of 30 years ago afforded. The city boy, they say, 
has no opportunity for doing ‘‘chores,” which are so effective in 
giving him an insight into everyday duties and which are so fruitful 
in developing his mental faculties and inculeating the spirit of work. 
The modern home has little wood to chop, water to carry, or repairs 
to make. 
The advent of the department store, with its offerings of ready- 
made clothes, and of the bakery, with its ready-made rolls and bread, 
have taken from the modern city girl the opportunity of making 
garments, of baking, and of doing a thousand and one things about 
the home which the girl of a generation ago did so well to her own 
advantage in later life. 
Efforts to correlate the work of the home with that of the school 
have heretofore, for the most part, been confined to the country 
schools. Now several cities have undertaken to give credit for home 
work. Among these cities are West Chester, Pa., Portland, Oreg., 
Leavenworth, Kans., and St. Cloud, Minn. The last three give 
credits in high school only. 
In Oregon any high school in the State may allow a total of 10 
per cent of credits for a university certificate of admission, on good 
life, good spirit, and good work at home. Supt. Alderman, of Portland, 
reports: 
Weare giving credit in school for music work done outside of school, and are in some 
schools giving credit for any work done at home.

RULES GOVERNING CREDIT FOR HOME WORK. 
Every Friday afternoon a Home Work Record Slip will be given to each pupil. 
Beginning with Sunday, all time spent by the pupil in home work should be entered 
in the proper space. : 
Each Monday morning a slip filled during the previous week should be returned 
to the teacher. The slip must be signed by the parent or guardian as an assurance 
that a correct record has been kept. 
Any work not listed but of value to the parents may be counted, and the nature of 
the work specified in the blank spaces. 
At the close of the school month, when the report of school work is made out, in 
the column “Home Work,” the pupil will be marked on the scale of 100 for actual 
work of not less than one-half hour each day, and in the column “Personal Care’’ 
on the scale of 100 for numbers A, B, C, and D, and for attendance at church or Sunday 
school. 
In addition to credit on the report card, reward may be given at the option of the 
principal for a specified amount of time spent in useful work at home. 
For purpose of reward credit of 5 minutes a day will be allowed for each operation 
listed as A, B, C, and D, and 20 minutes for attendance at church or Sunday school. 
In Sioux City the credits are limited to instrumental music; in 
Leavenworth one unit of credit is allowed in the high school for 
work done in any vocation, where the work has been checked up by 
heads of departments and found to be worthy of credit; in St. Cloud 
the credits gained by high-school students in outside work do not 
reduce the number of school credits required for graduation, but are 
extra credits or honors. 
XII. CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION. 
Not only are the vocational needs of individual children looked 
after as never before by the school management, but arrangements 
for the individual child’s progress through the grades unhindered 
and unhurried by others are also a matter of study and experiment 
at the present time, notwithstanding the fact that for 20 years 
promotion of pupils has been a subject for discussion in every school 
system. In systems that have adopted the six-grade elementary 
plan, followed by differentiated courses in the seventh and eighth 
grades, either with or without the designation ‘junior high school,” 
the proper classification of children can be more surely brought 
about, though from the standpoint of program making not more 
easily. One superintendent somewhat naively calls attention to the 
fact that since special classes and sections were formed in his schools, 
there are more questions coming up that he must decide. The old 
lock-step system caused little vexation of spirit in the superintendent; 
much in the children. In these days, happily, conditions are 
becoming reversed. 
Promotion schemes come and go. The celebrated Cambridge 
double-track plan has been modified beyond recognition. The

tively that all school men took notice, but as an exclusive system it 
is no longer found in operation anywhere. The North Denver plan 
is said to have furnished the idea underlying the ‘‘group system” 
now used in some New York schools and elsewhere, but changed 
conditions have superseded all these plans as complete and independ- 
ent schemes. They have made their contributions and nowappear 
only as elements in other plans. 
THE PHYSIOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION. 
Dr. C. Ward Crampton, director of physical training in New York, 
is quoted as saying that children should be classified according to 
their physiological development, rather than according to their 
school age in years. From birth to maturity children develop at 
different rates, some outstripping others in the race, so that at the 
age of 14 about one-third are already men and women, one-third 
are in a transition period, and one-third are quite immature. The 
difference between the mature and immature of the same age is so 
marked that it is astonishing that the idea of separating them for 
educational purposes has not occurred to our school authorities. 
The mature group are 30 to 50 per cent stronger and 10 to 15 per 
cent taller than the immature group of the same age. The mental 
abilities show an even more striking difference. In short, of those 
who are from 12 to 15 years of age, some are young men and others 
are children, regardless of their ages in years or progress in school, 
The young men with their ripened potential abilities sit on the same 
benches, are taught the same lessons, and are subject to the same 
discipline as children, and the results are quite as poor as they would 
naturally be under these circumstances. The fundamental fact that 
the immature and mature are wholly different and should receive 
different educational and social treatment is disregarded. In the 
elementary school the mature do badly; in the high school, frankly 
fitted to their needs, they do 20 to 50 per cent better than the imma- 
ture. While it is at this point that the educational system on the 
inflexible system of scholasticism and chronological age breaks down, 
it suffers also from a lack of rational classification wherever mature 
and immature children are brought together in the same classroom. 
Several years ago Dr. Crampton worked out his plan of classifying 
pupils according to physiological development in one high school and 
two elententary schools. In the high school in which the plan was 
tried Dr. Crampton found that 35 per cent fewer pupils dropped out 
of eight sections than from four sections classified according to 
‘custom. In the two elementary schools this system was tried in the 
last three classes. Equally satisfactory results were reported. The 
plan will be extended throughout the Commercial High School and 
will include four more elementary schools.

  138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
THE NORTH ADAMS PLAN, 
The course of study in the North Adams (Mass.) elementary schools 
makes no reference to years or grades, for the whole work is not 
divided into 9 parts, each part representing one year’s work, but into 
24 equal parts instead. This makes it possible to group the pupils 
according to ability, allowing each to go forward as fast as he can 
without ‘‘skipping.” or instance, many pupils will find it easy to 
take three sections of work each year and thereby complete the 
course in eight years, as represented in diagram 1. 
Bor 8 9G: BeBe 0 eI IS aS 4 1S) B17 18 a9 -20°-21 722) e 2a oe 
Diagram 1. 
Others, on account of ill health or for other good reasons, may 
not be able to cover three sections every year. For all such two. 
sections taken occasionally will enable them to graduate in nine 
years, as shown in diagram 2.

If, on the other hand, certain pupils are able, without undue effort, 
to take four sections occasionally, they will be prepared to graduate 
fromthe grammar school at the end of seven years. See diagram 3.

DiaGRaM 3. 
The work in each school is so planned that in each room there are 
two or three groups of pupils instead of one class. Therefore, the 
number of the room never means grade or year. 
If at any time it is necessary to know how far along in the course 
any boy or girl is, one simply asks, ‘What section of work is he 
doing?” For instance, if a boy is in section 12, he is half through 
the course; if in section 8, one-third through, and so on. 
SPECIAL CLASSES, 
Returns from 182 cities indicate that the special class for excep- 
tional children of one or more types is a feature well-nigh universal. 
Special provisions for the feeble-minded and backward are still far
-P-A-G-E-193
  PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 139 
more common than special provision for the highly gifted, though two 
cities not previously credited with such classes now report them. 
These are Southbridge and Springfield, Mass. Southbridge reports a 
selected eighth-grade class, taking Latin and algebra. In Springfield, 
selected pupils in the last two elementary grades are offered a modern 
foreign language as an extra study with high-school credit and first- 
year high-school English. Subject promotion has been extended 
downward to include the last three grammar grades, making them 
practically, though not in name, the junior high school. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. 
The junior high school consists usually of the last two grades of the 
elementary schools and the first high-school grade, with the teaching 
organized departmentally and with differentiated courses to meet the 
needs of pupils of different: tastes, different aptitudes, and different 
life purposes. Of 182 cities reporting, 17 have either adopted the 
junior high-school plan or are preparing to do so. Doubtless some of 
these, if not all, should be classed as making provision for highly 
gifted children in their differentiated courses. 
THE CITY COLLEGE. 
The city college, or municipal university, organized to carry the 
pupils four years beyond the high school, exists at present only in 
Cincinnati, though Los Angeles is moving in this direction. Akron, 
Ohio, will soon take over Buchtel College and make it a part of the 
city school system. The State legislature, at its session of 1913, 
enacted a law permitting cities to take over universities, the same to 
become city universities, to be maintained under a board of trustees 
appointed by the mayor and approved by the city council. The 
same law also empowers the taxing body of the city to levy a tax, 
not to exceed 5 mills, for the support of the city university. The 
Akron city council recently passed an ordinance to assume control of 
Buchtel College. The college authorities were desirous of making the 
transfer. Just as soon as the tax can be levied, the college, with all 
its endowments, equipments, etc., will become a city university, 
under the control of the board of trustees to be appointed by the 
mayor. 
XIII, DEPARTMENTAL TEACHING IN THE GRADES. 
In order to secure definite information relating to departmental 
teaching in city schools, the United States Bureau of Education 
recently sent a questionnaire upon this subject to superintendents in 
cities of 5,000 population and over. Of 813-replies received, 461 
report departmental teaching, some in all subjects and others in only 
afew. Not many have departmental teaching below the sixth grade 
and few favor it below the seventh, if there are eight grades in the

chiefly by frequent conferences of teachers, close supervision, and 
detailed courses of study. The following is a tabulation by States of

The following are typical of the views expressed by those who 
have experimented with departmental teaching in the grades: 
1. Succeeds with the strong and industrious pupils and fails with the weak and 
lazy. 
2. Tends to develop independence and self-reliance. 
3. Danger of teachers making their subjects of more importance than their pupils. 
4, Have had departmental teaching since 1896-97 and have found that it is more 
economical; that it requires pupils to be independent of the teacher; that they are 
better able to express their ideas, and that promotion can be made by subject. 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 141 
5. English should be distributed among the different teachers so that it may be 
coordinated with other subjects. 
6. Better teaching and discipline; more interest; less loss between grades. 
7. Satisfactory on the whole, but open to faults, such as overtaxing the child. 
8. Efficiency of pupils higher; discipline suffers. 
9. Makes the break between the grades and high school less sudden. 
10. All right if child does not meet too many teachers. 
11. Very superior; teachers more interested; pupils develop broader ideas. 
12. Excellent if teaching force is prepared and in favor of the plan. 
13. If there is a poor teacher in the departmental corps, pupils do not have her all 
the time. 
14. Will abandon the plan, as we secure better results with one teacher to a grade; 
discipline easier, and teachers prefer old method of having a room of their own. 
15. Gave the plan a fair trial, but it proved an absolute failure; perhaps the nov- 
elty of the plan caused some to think it a good scheme. 
16. Difficult to coordinate the work properly; moral hold of teacher not so strong; 
supervision by principal more difficult. 
17. Will abolish or greatly modify it this year; pupils are not taught individually. 
18. Do not care for it; would rather have one-teacher plan in first-year high school 
than extend departmental system to the grades. 
XIV. CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE WORK OF TEACHERS. 
SALARIES. 
Of 182 cities reporting, 83, or 45 per cent, have increased the sala- 
ries of teachers, and 45, or 25 per cent, the salary of the superintend- 
ent. The Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1912 made 
an equally good showing for this item. Many of the reports at hand 
refer to an increased maximum or a special maximum salary at- 
tainable for teachers of superior merit, the question of merit being 
determined by ratings made by supervisory officers. Professional 
progressiveness, evidenced by certificates for summer school work, 
university courses, or other means of professional improvement 
sought by the teacher, is a large factor in the merit system report. 
The extension of agencies for increasing the efficiency and widening 
the outlook of teachers already in service by utilizing these agencies 
in connection with salary schedules is a striking feature of present- 
day tendencies. Not many years ago the few cities in which discrim- 
ination was practiced on any other basis than previous preparation 
and length of service were pioneers, and they experienced all of 
the difficulties inherent in pioneering. They are now members of a 
large and growing company. A few typical statements from reports 
may be quoted: 
Phoenix, Ariz.—Teachers promoted solely on merit shown in schoolroom; attend- 
ance at summer school, and professional reading. 
Sacramento, Cal—aA new salary schedule was adopted. A provision which was 
formerly permissive has been made mandatory; it gives special increments of salary 
to teachers with a rating of good or higher who take advanced professional courses of 
study. We give any teacher a year’s leave of absence, without forfeiture of salary
-P-A-G-E-196
  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
except the pay of a beginning teacher, for study, for educational travel, or for the 
benefit of her health. 
‘Trinidad, Colo.—Superintendent conducts classes, credit for which is given at the 
State university and State teachers’ college; 42 teachers out of 67 took the work. 
Stamford, Conn.—Extension courses have been arranged with Teachers’ College, 
Columbia University, which will meet the educational requirements of the new 
regulations. 
Athens, Ga.—Reading course which teachers are required to take. 
Decatur, Ill.—Salary graded according to quality of service and extent of prepa- 
ration. 
Streator, I1l.—Continued service and promotion in salary will depend upon the 
strength, spirit, and growth shown by the teacher in all her school experiences. To 
this end the board reserves the right to make as a condition of any or all contracts the 
attendance upon an approved summer school or the following of a prescribed course 
of study or reading at home, as the board may elect. 
East Chicago, Ind.—New rule for salary increase according to credits for private or 
university work approved or outlined by superintendent. . Original preparation, per- 
sonality, and quality of teaching form basis. 
Evansville, Ind.—Salaries graded according to success, scholarship, and experience. 
Leave of absence granted to attend school. 
Logansport, Ind.—Salary of teachers increased by attendance at summer terms of 
universities, taking approved courses. 
Muncie, Ind.—Salary graded according to merit. 
Muscatine, Iowa.—Credit is given for full six weeks summer work in a recognized 
normal school and for regular college credits. Teachers having extra college or nor- 
mal work the past summer since records were compiled, or at any time hereafter, may 
have same entered to their credit by filing a certificate showing work done. 
Sioux City, Iowa.—No teacher will be promoted from class A who does not receive 
a rating of good. No teacher will be promoted from class B who does not receive a 
rating of strong. Teachers who do not receive the rating of strong, but who receive 
special commendation for effort may be continued in class B at $600. Teachers of 
classes A and B who receive superior rating may be advanced not more than two 
points in their salary schedule. 
Leavenworth, Kans.—All teachers progress in salary from the minimum, $50, to 
the maximum, $90; but teachers of exceptional ability are advanced by recommen- 
dation of the principal and superintendent, acted upon by the board. This means 
that teachers are advanced so many years, but never above the maximum. 
Topeka, Kans.—Professional reading and study. 
New Orleans, La.—The most significant change is in the matter of salary increase 
on a basis of efficiency. To secure this increase, teachers must be rated ‘superior’ 
in teaching efficiency and pass an examination in certain subjects. In lieu of the 
examination, certificates showing the successful completion of the work required in 
the examination in a summer school of approved standing will be accepted. 
Leominster, Mass.—Increase in salary given to those already receiving maximum 
dependent upon demonstrated efficiency. 
Newton, Mass.—Sabbatical year; university courses; salary graded according to 
quality of service. All in operation. 
Methuen, Mass.—Special increase for certain teachers attending summer schools. 
Westfield, Mass.—Final increase in salary dependent on special recommendation of 
superintendent. 
Jackson, Mich.—Teachers were divided into four classes: First, those who because 
of their poor quality were not reemployed; second, a slightly larger class who were 
reemployed without increase in pay because their work was unsatisfactory and will 
not be reemployed at the end of the following year unless the character of their work 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 143 
is materially improved; third, a still larger class who were reemployed at the mini- 
mum increase in salary; and, fourth, the remainder of the teaching force, constituting 
a large majority, who were reemployed at the maximum increase in salary. 
Duluth, Minn.—Grading salaries according to quality of service. 
Kansas City, Mo.—University courses are carried on, and a system of reading is 
required of all teachers. Advancement of salary depends upon satisfactory growth 
in professional interest and aptitude. 
Orange, N. J.—Salary graded according to merit of teacher. 
Paterson, N. J.—For 10 years Paterson teachers’ association has conducted uni- 
versity courses with the assistance of Teachers College, New York, and New York 
University. 
Kingston, N. Y.—Salary graded according to quality of work. 
Yonkers, N. Y.—An annual increase in salary for meritorious work has been the plan 
for several years. 
Canton, Ohio—Additional $50 given to teachers who take university courses during 
the summer. 
Lima, Ohio—Salary increases according to quality of service. 
Springfield, Ohio—Merit system in vogue for years. 
Newark, Ohio—Regular increase is doubled to teachers attending summer session 
in normal school or teachers’ college. Leave of absence granted. 
Portland, Oreg.—Lecture courses to be followed by reading and notebook work, 
for which college credit will be given. 
Philadelphia, Pa.—Advance salary denied to a teacher who fails to measure up to 
a certain standard of efficiency. 
Norristown, Pa.—Professional study under direction of superintendent’s univer- 
sity extension course. Salary determined by quality of work. 
Williamsport, Pa.—New salary schedule adopted June, 1913, which bases promo- 
tion on kind of certificate, teaching experience, ability to teach and govern, profes- 
sional interest, increased scholarly attainment. 
Erie, Pa.—According to quality of service, grade meetings, and one-half day 
monthly institutes. 
Charleston, 8. C.—Matriculation fees at summer schools paid by school board in 
the case of those teachers who complete successfully three or more courses. 
Houston, Tex.—University extension work accepted in place of institute and study 
circle work. 
Portsmouth, Va.—No teacher’s salary is increased beyond, a certain figure without 
the superintendent’s indorsement for “special efficiency.’’ 
La Crosse, Wis.—Salary graded according to quality of service. 
The latest rules formulated in any large city for regulating the 
advance in salaries of teachers are those now in force in New Orleans. 
They include the following: 
Section 1. Classification of teachers.—Teachers shall be classified into three classes, 
namely, A, B, ©. Class © shall include all teachers during the probationary period, 
including their first three years of service. Class B shall include all regularly ap- 
pointed teachers who have served not less than three years as teachers in the city 
schools and not qualified for class A. Class A shall include those who have com- 
pleted at least four years of service as a probationary and as a regularly appointed 
teacher, and have earned a rating of “superior” in efficiency in teaching, and have 
shown an advance in academic and professional scholarship, either through work 
done in colleges or summer schools during the four years next preceding their appli- 
cation for advancement to class A, or through an examination held under direction 
of the board.
-P-A-G-E-198
144 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Src. 2. Promotional examinations.—The subjects required for the promotional ex- 
amination for grade teachers shall be—Educational psychology, the psychology and 
pedagogy of three subjects taught in the elementary schools, and one of the following 
subjects of college grade: English and American literature, algebra, modern history, 
physics, chemistry, botany, or zoology. For high-school teachers the examination 
shall consist of the history and principles of secondary education, psychology and 
pedagogy of the special subject taught by the teacher, adolescent psychology, and 
the subject matter of the third or fourth year in college in the subject taught by the 
teacher. 
The promotional examination of class A for all special teachers shall include 
educational psychology, psychology and pedagogy of the special subject, the sub- 
ject matter of a complete college course in the special subject taught by the teacher, 
and the subject matter of a first year’s college course in a subject auxiliary to the 
special subject. 
Src. 3. Exemptions from promotional examinations.—Certificates from a college or 
summer school of recognized standing, showing the successful completion of not less 
than 90 class hours in any of the subjects named above, may be accepted in lieu of an 
examination in said subject: Provided, That teachers submitting certificates showing 
the completion of 12 courses in summer schools or colleges of recognized standing be- 
fore October 1, 1914, may have said certificates accepted in lieu of examination in 
four of the subjects required for promotional examinations to class A. 
Teachers in the elementary schools having received a bachelor’s degree from a college 
of recognized standing during the four years next preceding their application for 
advancement to class A will be excused from the promotional examination, provided 
that not less than 300 class hours were devoted in their college course to psychological 
and pedagogical subjects. 
Female teachers in the high schools who have received a bachelor’s degree from a 
college of recognized standing during the four years next preceding their application 
for advancement to class A may be excused from thc examination for promotion to 
class A, provided the subjects included in the promotional examination for high- 
school teachers have been pursued by them in their college course. 
Men teachers in the high schools who have received a master’s degree from a uni- 
versity of recognized standing during the four years next preceding their application 
for advancement to class A may be excused from the examination required for advance- 
ment to class A, provided a course of not less than 90 class hours in the psychology 
and pedagogy of the subject taught by the teacher was successfully completed among 
the requirements for the master’s degree. 
Sxc. 4. Application for promotional examination.—Applicants for promotion to 
class A who have been graded as ‘‘superior’’ under the provisions of these rules shall 
signify in writing their desire to stand promotional examination, and such examina- 
tions shall be held annually on a date to be fixed by the superintendent between 
August 15 and September 15. 
The rules state in detail the salaries of teachers of the three classes 
described in section 1. Following is the part referring to teachers of 
class A: 
Class A teachers shall receive a salary of $75 per month for the first year, and if they 
receive and maintain a rating of ‘‘superior’’ in efficiency, shall receive $80 per month 
the second, third, and fourth years, $85 per month the fifth, sixth, and seventh years, 
and $90 per month the eighth and subsequent years. 
Class A teachers who fail to receive a rating of ‘‘superior’’ in efficiency shall not be 
advanced in salary the following year, and those who fall below the rating of ‘‘good”” 
in efficiency shall be assigned to class B and receive such salary as they are entitled 
to under that class.

PROGRESS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 145 
TEACHERS’ COUNCILS. 
The recommendation made in the course of the New York survey 
that a supervisory council be organized and legalized, and the favor- 
able action of the school board thereon, calls attention again to a 
scheme for enlisting the active cooperation of teachers in school 
management that has had trial in a few cities. The recommendation 
was: 
That appropriate steps be taken to secure the creation of a supervisory council to 
be composed of the city superintendent, all of the district superintendents, and a 
selected number of directors, principals of training schools, principals of high schools 
principals of elementary schools, and representatives from the teaching staff in the 
various types and grades of schools. s 
To this supervisory council should be given general powers and directions with 
regard to programs of study and all other essential matters relating to the methods 
and standards of instruction. 
The organization of an advisory council is proceeding in New York 
along the lines of this recommendation. 
Boston’s council for the high schools ‘and committees for the ele- 
mentary schools are described in the superintendent’s annual report 
for 1909. 3 
New Britain, Conn., maintains a school council whose by-laws 
provide the following membership: 
(1) All principals, ex officio. 
(2) All supervisory officers and special teachers, ex officio. 
(3) One representative from each elementary grade, including kindergarten, to 
be elected by ballot by the teachers of the grade. 
(4) Representatives from the high school to be elected by the teachers of the high 
school. 
Supt. Alderman, of Portland, Oreg., is asking for an advisory 
council of principals and teachers. A teachers’ round table has been 
organized in Los Angeles by Supt. J. H. Francis for the discussion of 
school administrative problems and policies. The round table con- 
sists of a kindergartner, eight primary and eight grammar grade 
teachers, and a representative from each of the intermediate and the 
high schools and from each of the teachers’ organizations. The 
supervisors of special studies are also members of the round table. 
‘It is proposed to discuss from time to time such problems as salaries, 
books, teaching methods, special activities, etc. 
In Boston, New Britain, and Los Angeles the councils derive no 
power or responsibility from the board of education. They exist and 
operate on the initiative and under the authority of the superintend- 
ent of schools. 
On the recommendation of the superintendent, the Chicago board 
of education has authorized the organization of 14 group councils and 
17726°—xp 1913—vor 1——_10
-P-A-G-E-200
  146 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
1 general council of teachers. The aim and purpose of the group coun- 
cils and the general council are: To give full and free expression or 
voice to the different attitudes and judgments of the teaching force 
on questions pertaining to courses of study, textbooks, departmental 
work, duties and advancement of teachers; the general study of edu- 
cational questions by the entire public-school teaching corps; and to 
enable the superintendent to become conversant at first hand with 
these attitudes and judgments. 
In Dallas, Tex., a teachers’ advisory council was organized in 1909 
on the recommendation of Supt. Lefevre. It was recognized by a 
rule of the board of education and it made reports directly to the 
board. Instead of bringing about a greater degree of cooperation, 
it divided, instead of united, the teachers and the superintendent. 
This council is not now in existence. The present superintendent is 
quoted as saying: 
We find that we have no earthly use for such an institution. It was the source of 
more political broils, more prejudices and disputes, and more political activity op 
the part of teachers than anything ever instituted before in our schools. Certain 
teachers who were candidates for members of the council were so politically active 
that they had campaign managers who assisted in pulling the wires, soliciting votes 
among teachers, and thus securing their election. This one thing got the teachers 
and the schools into trouble that it will take 10 years to eradicate. 
The Dallas council seems to have been organized on a wrong basis. 
Those now advocating the formation of councils with legal standing 
in the school system recognize the fact that the superintendent must 
be at least ex officio at the head in order that the kind of cooperation 
sought may be possible.

  CHAPTER VII. 
FIVE YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 
By Nina C. VANDEWALKER, 
ContTEeNtS.—A subject of university study—A demonstration of education by develop- 
ment—Status of the training schools—Extension of kindergarten activity—Causes 
of growth—The national kindergarten association—Cooperation of the Bureau of 
Education. 
A SUBJECT OF UNIVERSITY STUDY. 
The fact that the kindergarten has made progress in the few 
years since the history of the movement was written is sufficiently 
evident to be beyond question.!. The extent of that progress is diffi- 
cult to measure with precision, because there has been no compilation 
and comparison of statistics at stated periods, but the fact of its 
progress is clearly observable nevertheless. Among the manifesta- 
tions are an increase of interest in and a study of the kindergarten 
on the part of primary teachers and supervisors; a more comprehen- 
sive study of the kindergarten in its relation to general education 
on the part of kindergartners themselves; the raising of the standard 
of kindergarten training schools; and a marked increase in the 
number of kindergartens throughout the country. 
The fact that the kindergarten is receiving more attention from 
primary teachers and those engaged in school administration than 
it has in the past is apparent in many directions, but perhaps in none 
more so than in the increased number of these who take courses bear- 
ing upon the kindergarten in such institutions as the University of 
Chicago and Teachers College, New York City. In the first-named 
institution the registration in the kindergarten department the past 
summer was 50 per cent greater than the summer before, and fully 
half of those taking the kindergarten courses were primary teachers. 
A corresponding increase is observable also in the courses at Teach- 
ers College. This increased study is due in part to the fact that the 
necessity for the knowledge in question has been thrust upon both 
primary teachers and school principals by the demand for a greater 
number of kindergartens. It is due no less to the tendencies of 
present-day education. The principle of development is dominant 
in current educational thought, and the kindergarten which embodies

that principle is rich in suggestion for the work of the grades. So 
largely, in fact, have the spirit and methods of the kindergarten 
been adopted in the grades that a present-day course in primary 
methods which made no reference to the kindergarten would be con- 
sidered as lacking its most essential factor. Primary teachers under- 
take the study of the kindergarten because they recognize that the 
Inowledge contributes to their success, since it enables them to uti- 
lize the foundation which the kindergarten has laid. These and 
similar reasons have impelled school principals and supervisors to 
take the courses in question. In New Jersey those who aspire to 
leadership have no choice, since a kindergarten examination is re- 
quired of all who aspire to principalships. 
Courses bearing upon every phase of kindergarten work are now 
offered at Teachers College, New York. Some of these are intended 
_for kindergartners and those qualifying for kindergarten training 
and supervision; some are organized with the needs of the primary 
teacher in mind; and others are intended primarily for those who 
are preparing for administrative work. There is a course bearing 
upon “The Relation between the Kindergarten and the Primary 
School” and another entitled “ Educational Theorists of the Nine- 
teenth Century.” These are electives; but that none should escape 
without some knowledge, a discussion of the kindergarten is included 
in two at least of the required courses, namely, in “ Theory and Prac- 
tice of Teaching in the Elementary Schools” and in “ Elementary 
Supervision.” Such courses have been organized in response to ex- 
pressed needs, and they are taken by those who will occupy strategic 
positions in the near future. 
Other evidence that the kindergarten is gaining in influence is 
found in the fact that kindergartners themselves are studying their 
work and its relation to general education in these same universities 
side by side with primary teachers and school principals. How new 
this is, only kindergartners themselves can realize. Kindergartners 
of the past studied Froebel and the kindergarten while in training, 
to be sure, but that study had too often tended to make them consider 
the kindergarten as isolated from the school, instead of a part of it. 
The former kindergarten training courses did not, therefore, furnish 
an incentive to the larger study of education, such as the courses 
the universities now offer. Less than a decade ago a kindergartner 
with a degree could hardly be found, but within the past half dozen 
years Teachers College and the University of Chicago have granted 
degrees to scores of kindergartners for which courses in education 
were a requisite. What has caused this change of attitude, and what 
does it signify for the kindergarten movement? The answer to these 
questions calls for a brief glance at the history of kindergarten 
training.

  FIVE YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 149 
A DEMONSTRATION OF EDUCATION BY DEVELOPMENT. 
When the kindergarten first came to the United States the doc- 
trine of education by development had received but little considera- 
tion, and it was because the kindergarten furnished a practical 
demonstration of that doctrine that it attracted much attention. 
The training courses that were organized naturally placed their 
emphasis upon the exposition of the Froebelian doctrines and the 
technique of kindergarten procedure.t Since the Froebelian con- 
ception of education was recognized by all as higher than that upon 
which prevailing education was based, kindergartners came to think 
of kindergarten education as of a higher order than school education 
and of general educational theory as having little value for them. 
The training given, therefore, concerned itself with the kinder- 
garten as such only, and gave little heed to educational procedure 
in general. Because it considered the exposition of the kindergarten 
as its chief purpose, and lost sight of the whole of which the kinder- 
garten is a part, it gave students a one-sided conception of Froebelian 
doctrines. Kindergarten training, therefore, became narrow, and 
the procedure of the kindergarten was stereotyped and out of har- 
mony with the principle of development which it, supposedly, 
exemplified. 
THE COMMITTEE OF NINETEEN. 
While kindergarten training and procedure were thus tending 
toward isolation from the school, an awakening was taking place in 
general education which was to counteract this tendency.? Re- 
searches in biology and psychology showed the principle of develop- 
ment to be the principle upon which true education must be based, 
and as a result of the clearer insight into the nature of education a 
reorganization of the aims and methods of general education was 
undertaken. In this reorganization the kindergarten was recognized 
as a type of the education desired, and it furnished many suggestions 
for the work immediately following. Because the facts of the child’s 
development were but imperfectly known when the kindergarten 
was organized, however, it also was shown to have defects which 
needed remedying in order to make it an organic part of the school 
system. Some kindergartners accepted the criticisms made and 
endeavored to free kindergarten procedure from its defects. Others 
did not consider the criticisms valid, and adhered to the established 
forms. In consequence diversity of procedure began to appear and the

  150 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
public was at a loss to know what constituted true kindergartening. 
It was to discuss questions of this character that the International 
Kindergarten Union in 1903 appointed a committee, eventually 
known as the Committee of Nineteen, composed of those who 
held opposing views as to where the authority determining kinder- 
garten procedure lay—whether in Froebel alone or in Froebel’s 
views only so far as they are sanctioned by present-day scientific 
knowledge. Through the deliberations of this committee, which 
have extended over nine years and have been but recently completed, 
kindergartners have been made aware that present-day educational 
theory furnishes a different basis for kindergarten methods than the 
traditional one, and that the results to be obtained upon this basis 
are of a higher order. This has created an attitude toward general 
education, and even toward the kindergarten itself, that is new to 
many—the attitude of inquiry. 
Kindergartners are beginning to realize that if the kindergarten 
is to fulfill the function in the educational system which recent edu- 
cational theory has assigned to it, both kindergarten and school alike 
must take the present-day knowledge of the child’s development and 
the present-day interpretation of life as the basis of their procedure. 
On this basis, however, a knowledge of Froebel alone will not be a 
sufficient equipment. It is because of this realization that kinder- 
gartners in such numbers are taking university courses in education. 
The kindergartner and the primary teacher alike realize that neither 
can do her part fully in furthering the child’s development without a 
knowledge of the work of the other, and both have enrolled in uni- 
versity courses. The openness of mind that now characterizes many 
kindergartners is one of the most gratifying evidences of kinder- 
garten progress. It is this attitude which will make further growth 
possible. 
STATUS OF THE TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
The fact that kindergarten instruction is now given in the largest 
university in the United States and in several smaller ones means 
much to kindergarten training. It can not be doubted that the 
quality of the kindergarten work throughout the country will be 
materially improved by such instruction. The improvement will be 
slow, however, unless the training given in the 150 institutions of 
narrower aim is good also.t Had the training in these been better 
during the past 20 years, the kindergarten would now occupy a much 
larger place in public favor. The training is still meager in many 
schools, but the standard has been raised materially during the past 
five years. In this respect, as in others, it is difficult to measure

FIVE YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 151 
progress, because of the lack of adequate statistics. The committee 
of investigation, appointed by the International Kindergarten Union, 
has secured fairly complete data concerning the training schools of 
the present as to character, entrance requirements, length of course, 
and number of students. By comparing the facts thus obtained with 
those collected by Miss Clara L, Anderson in 1903 marked progress 
is observable in certain directions. Neither of these inquiries at- 
tempted to secure data concerning the curricula and method of the 
training schools, however, and no definite information can therefore 
be given concerning progress along these lines, 
A comparison of the statistics of 1903 with those of 1913 shows 
that the number of institutions that give kindergarten instruction 
has not been greatly increased during that period, but that there 
has been a marked change in the character of the institutions. In 
1903 there were over 90 training schools that were private or chari- 
table in character and only about 50 that were supported by State 
or city funds. In 1913 there were fewer than 70 private and chari- 
table training schools and nearly 90 supported by public funds. 
During the decade 20 of the smaller private schools and 2 or 3 of 
the larger ones, including Mrs, Putnam’s in Chicago and Mrs, Phoebe 
Hearst’s in Washington, have been discontinued. The kindergarten 
departments in from 15 to 20 of the State or city normal schools 
have been discontinued likewise. This loss has been fully compen- 
sated, however, by the establishment of others of even greater 
importance. Of the 40 new training schools or departments estab- 
lished, but 12 are private. Among these the most important are the 
training schools established by the New York Kindergarten Asso- 
ciation and the Froebel League in New York City, and the one at 
South Bend, Ind. Among the most important of the 28 public insti- 
tutions that have added kindergarten departments are the normal 
schools of the State of Washington; the Illinois Normal University; 
the normal school at Montclair, N. J.; the Western Michigan Nor- 
mal; the normal school at Superior, Wis.; the normal schools at 
Farmville and Harrisonburg, Va.; and the city training schools of 
New York and Brooklyn. This list does not include the kinder- 
garten departments in the normal schools that are used for pur- 
poses of observation only—about 18 or 20 in all. 
The decrease in the number of small private training schools and 
the increase of those supported by public funds are in themselves 
a proof that the kindergarten is gaining in favor among school 
authorities. The kindergartners who have exchanged private for 
public work have become more vital factors in the progress of the 
kindergarten because of that fact. No kindergartner can work in 
a normal school where problems of general education are constantly 
considered without getting some conception, if only by absorption,
-P-A-G-E-206
    
  152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of present-day educational theory and practice, and her views of 
her own work are thus greatly enlarged. No one worthy of a posi- 
tion in such an institution can help realizing that standards of 
scholarship prevail in the training of grade teachers that should 
prevail’ in the training of kindergartners likewise, but those stand- 
ards have been ignored in the past in the kindergarten training 
schools. The increase in public training schools has therefore meant 
an increase in the number of kindergarten training teachers who 
have adopted a broader view of kindergarten education and who 
see the necessity for higher standards, 
It has been stated already that no statistics have been collected 
concerning the curricula and methods of the kindergarten training 
schools, and, in consequence, no statement based upon figures can be 
presented to show that improvement has been made along these 
lines. There is much evidence of such improvement, however. The 
kindergartners with advanced training have evidently succeeded, 
as they are increasingly sought by school superintendents and normal- 
school presidents. The demand for them, in fact, is far in excess 
of the supply. 
From the observation of the work of some of the schools and 
from reports concerning that of others, it is apparent that courses of 
kindergarten instruction are under reorganization in many training 
schools, both public and private, and that the methods have a better 
pedagogical basis. 
EXTENSION OF KINDERGARTEN ACTIVITY. 
The most noticeable evidence of kindergarten advancement is 
found in increased numbers. On this point, too, the International 
Union has fairly complete statistics concerning the present status 
of the kindergarten, but the corresponding statistics of earlier periods 
are not full enough for thoroughly satisfactory comparisons. A 
comparison of the statistics of 1913 with those collected in 1903 
shows the progress made during a decade as follows: In 1903 there 
were in the United States over 4,000 kindergartens in about 900 
cities and villages. Of this number, nearly 900 were private, 600 
charitable, and 2,500 public. Together they enrolled about 200,000 
children. In 1913 there were 8,880 kindergartens reported in 1,105 
cities. Of these, nearly 700 are private, 567 charitable, and 7,600 
public. The enrollment in the private and charitable kindergartens 
is not quite 30,000, and that in the public ones 276,000. The total 
kindergarten enrollment is therefore 306,000. 
Tt is interesting to note the growth in the different groups of 
States. In New England the kindergarten has but little more than 
held its own. The number of cities reported as having kindergartens
-P-A-G-E-207
FIVE YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 153 
in 1913 is, in fact, slightly smaller than the number in 1903.° This 
is true also of the number of private and charitable kindergartens. 
In the public kindergartens there has been a fair increase, however— 
from 416 to 597. In the group containing New York, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, and Delaware the number of cities with kindergartens 
and the number of private and charitable kindergartens has also 
decreased, but the number of public kindergartens has risen from 
1,432 to 3,618. In the 16 Southern States there is an increase all 
around. The number of cities has increased from 150 to 173; the 
number of kindergartens other than public from 260 to 324. The 
number of public kindergartens has increased more than threefold, 
having risen from 192 to 681. In the 7 States of the Central West, 
namely, Ohio, Indiana, Mlinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
and Jowa, the growth has been equally marked, with the exception 
of the number of kindergartens not public, which has decreased from 
380 to 299. The number of cities has risen from 246 to 460, however, 
and the public kindergartens have more than trebled here also, hav- 
ing increased from 793 to 2,650. In the remaining 15 States—the 
two Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, and those still farther west—the 
kindergarten has secured but a slight foothold, excepting in Nebraska, 
Colorado, and California. Progress has been made there also, though 
the number of private and charitable kindergartens has decreased 
from 157 to 125. The number of cities having kindergartens has 
risen from 117 to 145 and- the number of public kindergartens from 
214 to 508. 
- The figures for the whole United States furnish evidence of prog- 
ress that can not be doubted. It is significant that though the num- 
ber of private and charitable kindergartens has decreased during 
the decade, the public kindergartens have trebled in number. ; 
It is interesting to note how the States rank in this accounting. 
In the number of cities having kindergartens, Wisconsin leads with 
142; Michigan is second with 128; and New York third, with 92. 
In the number of kindergartens, New York leads; Ohio is second; 
and Wisconsin is third. In the number of children enrolled New 
York again leads; Illinois is second; and Michigan is third. 
CAUSES OF GROWTH. 
The causes for the progress recorded are complex, but, broadly 
speaking, they may be reduced to two. The first of these is found in 
the tendencies of present-day education and the standards of kinder- 
garten work which have been set by public-school authorities. How 
these have operated to bring about kindergarten progress has already 
been discussed. The second reason is to be found in the faith of 
kindergartners in the inherent value of the fundamental doctrines 
on which their work is based and in their concerted efforts to win  
-P-A-G-E-208
  154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
for those doctrines a larger influence in American education. It was 
to create an agency by means of which that influence might be ex- 
erted that the International Kindergarten Union was organized 21 
years ago, and it is to the cumulative efforts of that body, in no small 
degree, that the growth of kindergarten activity has been brought 
about. The meetings which it has held in the largest cities of the 
country, the work that has been done by the committees it has ap- 
pointed, and the cooperation in the direction of kindergarten ex- 
tension which it has effected with the National Congress of Mothers, 
the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, and the National Educa- 
tion Association—all these have been means to the ends, whose 
results have become apparent in the past five or more years. It was 
because the leaders in the International Kindergarten Union saw 
the need of definite knowledge concerning the status of the kinder- 
garten that the organization appointed a committee of investigation 
in 1911 to make the inquiry whose results are recorded in this paper. 
That inquiry was recognized as but a part of a systematic campaign 
of propagation. It is in such a campaign, which has hardly more 
than begun, that the National Kindergarten Association, of which 
more will be said, has rendered invaluable service. Equally vital 
to the movement has been the work done by the committee on train- 
ing and supervision. The committee has conducted each year in 
connection with the meeting of the International Kindergarten Union 
a conference of training teachers, at which topics of vital importance 
in the training of kindergartens have been discussed. These con- 
ferences have been devoted largely to reports of studies made during 
the year of some phase of training work, such as the training school 
curriculum, the method of teaching a given subject, or the organiza- 
tion of the practice teaching. Sometimes they have been given to a 
discussion of topics upon which there were legitimate differences of 
opinion, akin to those of the committee of nineteen. It has been in 
the training teachers’ conferences, arranged by the committee on 
training, that kindergarten thought and practice have, in great 
measure, been shaped. During the past five years the International 
Kindergarten Union leaders have seemed to sense the needs of the 
kindergarten in a marked degree, and the present growth is in part 
a result of that fact. 
THE NATIONAL KINDERGARTEN ASSOCIATION. 
The National Kindergarten Association, which has but recently 
come into the field, has also done effective work in furthering kinder- 
garten progress. This organization has confined itself chiefly to the 
awakening of public interest in the kindergarten and to establishing 
kindergartens where they had not yet been adopted; but it has set 
many agencies into operation to effect these purposes, and its results
-P-A-G-E-209
FIVE YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN PROGRESS. 155 
have been far-reaching. The story of its origin is thus told in one of 
its reports: 
The National Kindergarten Association sprang into being as the direct result 
of the fact that a young mother was unable to find good kindergartens for her 
little boys in either of two large cities in which they lived in Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey. In 1906, she suggested that a national society was greatly needed: 
to arouse interest in the kindergarten and to help establish good kindergartens 
after the interest had been awakened. During three years considerable time and 
thought were expended in investigation, and it was found that such societies 
existed in other parts of the world, and that there was in the United States a 
large amount of most important work which could and should be done. 
After much preliminary work, two meetings were held in New 
York City in 1909, and as a result the association was formally or- 
ganized. The active work of the association began in January, 1910. 
The admirable work which this association has been able to accom- 
plish for the kindergarten cause has been made possible by contribu- 
tions from persons in different parts of the country who are interested 
in kindergarten education and able to give financial assistance. The 
association assumed in the beginning that such assistance would be 
willingly given if the value of the kindergarten to the 4,000,000 
children between 4 and 6 years of age in the United States could be 
made clear. The fact that millions of dollars are contributed an- 
nually to the colleges of the country justified that assumption. In its 
anticipations the association has not been disappointed. The contri- 
butions received have enabled it to collect much needed information 
concerning the kindergarten movement and to carry out important 
lines of work tending to kindergarten propagation. Among these 
have been: (1) Preparing leaflets containing information about the 
kindergarten and distributing them at meetings of women’s clubs and 
teachers’ associations; (2) furnishing speakers on kindergarten sub- 
jects at such meetings without expense to the organizations them- 
selves; (8) sending out loan libraries on kindergarten subjects and 
exhibits of kindergarten work and materials; and (4) establishing, in 
a few instances, demonstration kindergartens in strategic localities 
for short periods. In addition to this, the association has worked 
with the educational and other authorities of certain States for the 
enactment of legislation making the establishment of kindergartens 
possible. The association has already been a large factor in the 
development of interest in the kindergarten, and the results of its 
efforts will become increasingly apparent as the years pass. 4 
COOPERATION OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
One of the most gratifying occurrences of recent years is the estab- 
lishment of a division of kindergarten statistics in the bureau of 
education. This is the outgrowth of the commissioner’s conviction 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
    156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
that the kindergarten has a value for American education, and that 
it should form an organic part of the school system. This division 
is designed to collect important information at stated periods for the 
purpose of determining the needs of the movement and of measuring 
its progress. Such information will aid intelligent and comprehen- 
sive constructive work. As a means to the constructive work in 
question a committee has been designated, composed of leading kin- 
dergartners, to cooperate with the Bureau of Education in gaining 
needed information concerning the kindergarten training schools, and 
later to work toward their unification and standardization. The 
committee has organized subcommittees to give assistance in other 
lines. One of these is to furnish expert advice on questions of kinder- 
garten policy as it may be needed, and another is to arrange for a 
series of bulletins for publication by the bureau. 
It is because of the .evidences of progress enumerated that the 
friends of the kindergarten are encouraged over the outlook. They 
realize, however, that although much has been done, the work to be 
accomplished has hardly more than begun. To secure for the 
4,000,000 children of kindergarten age in the United States the privi- 
leges which have thus far been secured for but 300,000 is the great 
task that remains. But were this accomplished there would still be 
need of effort. The spirit which the kindergarten embodies must be 
infused into the school, for that spirit is too often stifled by formalism 
when the kindergarten becomes a part of the school. When the ideals 
of the kindergarten have become the ideals of the school, then, and 
not until then, will the school be able to render its truest service to 
‘the children of America; and not until that condition has been 
reached should the friends of the kindergarten cease in their efforts 
for its advancement.

    WORK OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. 
The Division of Rural Education.—The Division of Rural Education 
of the bureau as now organized is made up of four specialists in rural 
education, three of whom occupy positions created for the first time 
in the middle of the school year, and of approximately 60 special 
collaborators, each paid a nominal sum as a field agent to keep the 
office informed of important developments in rural education. Dur- 
ing the year the attention of three of the specialists has been engaged 
largely in field studies in rural education, one in the South, one in 
the Northwest, and one in the Middle West and the East. The fourth 
spent three months in Denmark, studying the rural schools and folk 
high schools of that country. 
Much yaluable work has been done by special collaborators in 
reporting developments in the parts of the United States in which 
they are located. Several of them are engaged in special studies. 
As the majority of them have been appointed during the year, time 
enough has not elapsed for much completed work in these special 
studies. Up to date the bureau has published but one bulletin pre- 
pared by arural collaborator. This is Bulletin 1913, No. 23, prepared 
by E. C. Branson, entitled The Georgia Club at the State Normal 
School, Athens, Ga., for the Study of Rural Sociology. Acknowledg- 
ment is due for special reports used in preparing this chapter from 
the following collaborators: L. J. Hanifan, West Virginia; M. J.

RURAL SCHOOL MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION. 
Evidence of the increased interest in rural education is found in the 
movement for a more efficient management of the schools. This 
relates particularly to the adoption of a better unit of organization 
and administration than exists in many States, especially in those 
organized on the “district” basis—the “single district”’ basis as it is 
sometimes called to distinguish it from the township and county unit 
basis.!. In five States—Colorado, Ohio, Wisconsin, North Dakota, 
and Texas—measures were before the legislatures during the 1913 
session proposing to abandon the present systems of organization 
and to adopt the county as a unit. Colorado, Texas, and Wisconsin 
are now on the district basis, and Ohio and North Dakota are on the 
township basis. In each of these States it was proposed to establish a 
strong county board in charge of all schools of the county and a 
county superintendent to be appointed by the board as the executive 
officer of the board and the supervisor of the schools. In three of 
these States the measures failed, largely for a lack of general informa- 
tion regarding the merits of the various systems of organization. In 
Ohio action was postponed on any bill changing the present organiza- 
tion until the special commission mentioned elsewhere in this chapter 
shall report with recommendations concerning the public-school sys- 
tem of the State.

RURAL EDUCATION. 159 
A bill passed the Wisconsin Legislature, approved in August, 1913, 
providing for a county board of education in every county to share 
the responsibility of the school management with the local district 
school trustees. The remaining power in the management of the 
schools will continue with the local trustees, but the county board of 
education will have charge of the work of the county superintendent, 
and the individual schools will have supervision both in their instruc- 
tional work and their management such as they never had before. 
The movement is a long step forward toward the adoption of the 
county unit plan. 
From all parts of the United States comes evidence of increased 
realization of the need for more and better supervision. State depart- 
ments of education are appointing officers to give their entire time to 
stimulating interest in rural education and constructive State-wide 
work for better rural schools. The actual supervision of the work of 
teachers and the management of pupils must rest with local super- 
visors. In New England rural schools are, comparatively speaking, 
well supervised. Townships employ superintendents, either indi- 
vidually or in groups of two or more, called “union districts.” Prac- 
tically all parts of New England are now organized in supervision dis- 
tricts small enough for the schools to be visited by the superintendent 
many times during the year. In Ohio township supervision is author- 
ized, but only about one-fourth of the townships have supervisors. 
The others have no supervision except from the local school board. 
The number with professional supervision has increased during the 
year. Many new townships have consolidated their schools and now 
employ a principal for a centralized school who supervises the work of 
all teachers employed in the township. In the other States, generally 
speaking, county superintendents are employed, who with their 
assistants, in the comparatively few counties where assistants are 
employed, exercise all the supervision that is provided for rural 
schools.! It is more generally realized that in the average county the 
county superintendent alone can do little effectual supervisory work. 
Several ways in which assistance is given to the county superin- 
tendent are discussed later in this chapter. 
State supervisors of rural schools.—-Since the publication of the 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1912, which contains a 
list of the States employing special State agents to devote their entire 
time to rural schools, the number has increased to 24. Several other 
States which formerly employed one supervisor each now have two 
or more. 
  
‘Information regarding the unit of supervision is contained in bulletin of the Bureau of Education, 1913, No. 8.

  160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Jowa-is now one of the States with such an officer, and his appoint- 
ment is one of the results of recommendations of the Iowa Better 
Schools Commission. The 1913 legislature provided for an official in 
the State department of education to be known as the ‘Rural school 
inspector.” The Montana Legislature has also provided an officer 
with the same title. Florida has two State rural school supervisors, 
one of whom was formerly employed by the State with financial 
assistance from the Southern Education Board. Both are now paid 
from State funds. Georgia, where a State supervisor of rural schools 
has been employed for several years with financial assistance from the 
Southern Education Board, now has three such supervisors, paid 
entirely from State funds. With money furnished by the General 
Education Board a supervisor is employed who is devoting his entire 
time to the negro rural schools of the State. North Carolina, Ala- 
bama, and Arkansas have each added during the year a State super- 
visor for negro rural schools. Supervisors for rural negro schools are 
now employed in six States: Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama, 
North Carolina, and Georgia. 
Ohio employs no State rural supervisors, but it does employ district 
supervisors of agricultural education in elementary and secondary 
schools, each of whom has approximately one-fourth of the State. 
They were appointed in 1911 under the provision of the Cahill Act. 
This act gives to the State commissioner of schools* the duty of super- 
intending the agricultural work in the schools and also the power of 
selecting the four supervisors as assistants. The supervisors have 
necessarily concerned themselves with all phases of the rural school 
work and have been a great power in establishing better facilities for 
rural education. 
The table following gives the States employing rural supervisors or 
rural school inspectors. The Ohio agricultural supervisors are 
included.

State officers in charge of agricultural club work.—In several States 
there are employed agents as supervisors of boys’ agricultural clubs 
and girls’ household science clubs and other organizations doing 
similar work. In some instances they are employed by the State 
departments of education, in others by the State university or the 
State college of agriculture. Their work is with and through rural 
schools, but they exercise no supervision of general school work. 
The 1913 Legislature of Oregon authorized the State superintend- 
ent of public instruction to employ two assistants to give their entire 
time to supervising industrial work in the public schools. The men 
employed are under the direction of the State superintendent, but 
are affiliated with the State Agricultural College. The industrial 
work is largely agricultural. 
In Idaho a supervisor of agricultural club work is employed, his 
salary and traveling expenses being paid from a private contribution. 
His work, however, is under the full direction of the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction. 
In Utah a ‘‘field expert in industrial education” is employed by 
the State university. His work consists of the supervision of city 
17726°—xp 1918—vor 1——11 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
    162 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
school gardens and rural agricultural clubs, domestic science clubs, 
and school improvement associations. The president of the univer- 
sity is a member of the State board of education, and through this 
connection a close relationship of the work of the industrial 
supervisor is maintained with the State superintendent of public 
instruction. The work is not closely correlated with that of the 
State College of Agriculture. 
A cooperative arrangement exists in several States between the 
State colleges of agriculture and the Office of Farm Management of 
the United States Department of Agriculture, which unite in employ- 
ing State agents for boys’ agricultural club work done under the 
auspices of the State colleges and the United States Department of 
Agriculture. In certain instances these agents are working in close 
cooperation with the State departments of education; in others they 
are not. The work is new, and it is impossible to say what the final 
adjustment will be. The States in which such agents are employed 
are Massachusetts, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, West Virginia, 
Kentucky, and Wyoming. In the cotton States the State agents in 
charge of the farm demonstration work of the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture have charge also of the boys’ agricultural 
clubs. In the South the girls’ clubs are in the hands of the State 
organizers of school improvement associations in most of the States 
in which such officers are employed. 
Increased county rural school supervision —Rural supervision sup- 
plementary to that given by county superintendents has assumed sev- 
eral forms. Assistant county superintendents are employed in many 
States, but as a rule only in the larger counties. They are some- 
times called rural school supervisors. They work with the county 
superintendent and under his direction in whatever part of the 
county they may be most needed. In West Virginia and Oregon 
these assistants are ‘‘district superintendents,’ and confine their 
work to special districts. They are, however, under the authority 
of the county superintendents. In West Virginia this district is the 
magisterial district; in Oregon it is an arbitrary school supervisory 
district determined by the county board of education. In other 
States assistant superintendents or supervisors confine themselves 
to some particular phase of the educational work of the county. 
These are the primary supervisors, industrial supervisors, supervisors 
of instruction in agriculture or in the household arts and sciences, 
etc. In a few States there are rural school supervising principals; 
that is, principal teachers in country buildings with two or more 
rooms who devote part of their time to supervising groups of sur- 
rounding smaller schools.
-P-A-G-E-217
       RURAL EDUCATION. 163 
This supplementary supervision is therefore given by the follow- 
ing officers: 
(a) Assistant county superintendents. 
(6) Rural school or county supervisors. 
(c) District superintendents or supervisors. 
(d) Supervisors of special subjects. 
(e) Supervising principals over a group of schools. 
Probably in every State with the county unit of supervision assist- 
ant superintendents or rural school supervisors are employed in a 
few of the large and progressive counties. Much progress has been 
made during the past year or two in providing such officers, partic- 
ularly in the Southern States. Until 1911 practically no assistants 
were provided in any Southern State; in 1912-13 over 100 were em- 
ployed. This includes about 70 employed in the State of Kentucky, 
all of whom began work in the fall of 1912. In addition to this, West 
Virginia now has 64 district superintendents. This is an increase of 
22 over the previous year. It means that now practically 18 per 
cent of the magisterial districts of the State employ district superin- 
tendents; that in one-half of the counties one or more superintendents 
are employed, and that 2,000, or nearly one-third of all of the rural 
teachers in the State, are teaching in supervised magisterial districts, 
Oregon has the same number of district supervisors as last year, as 
the law providing district supervisors in that State is mandatory, 
and not merely permissive as in West Virginia. An attempt was 
made during the 1913 session of the legislature to repeal the super- 
vision law passed in 1911, on the ground that district supervision is 
unnecessary and expensive. A measure allowing each county to 
decide for itself whether or not it should have district supervision 
passed the lower house, but was defeated in the upper house by an 
overwhelming vote. 
Several States without previous legislation for the purpose have 
recently passed laws providing for assistant county superintendents 
or rural school supervisors. The new Wisconsin law providing for 
county boards of education, mentioned before, gives to those boards 
the authority to appoint assistant county superintendents in all 
counties with more than 100 teachers, The 1913 Legislature of 
Tennessee authorized county boards of education to employ county 
supervisors and to pay them from county funds. In the weaker 
counties a part of the State equalization fund may be used to pay 
one-half of the salary of supervisors. 
County rural school industrial supervisors are employed principally 
in the Southern States, both in schools for white pupils and for negro 
pupils. In schools for white pupils such supervisors are found in 
approximately 25 counties in Virginia, Georgia, and Louisiana. The 
movement has made more headway among negro schools than among   
-P-A-G-E-218
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
white schools, because of the fact that the Jeanes Foundation, a fund 
for the benefit of negro education, has been used to assist in the em- 
ployment of negro industrial supervisors. Such officers are paid 
from the Jeanes Foundation in nearly 125 counties in 12 Southern 
States. 
In a comparatively few counties scattered throughout the United 
States there are supervisors of special subjects, such as agriculture, 
household arts, science, music, drawing, ete. In widely separated 
States supervisors of primary work are employed. Counties in 
Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, and Minnesota are among those report- 
ing primary supervisors. The agricultural supervisors and domestic 
science supervisors in some instances are in charge of boys’ and girls’ 
agricultural and household science club work; in other instances, 
they actually supervise the teaching of these subjects as regular 
school studies in all schools of the county. For example, Box Elder 
County, Utah, organized with the entire county as one school dis- 
trict, employs a county superintendent and four assistants—a pri- 
mary supervisor, a supervisor of music, a supervisor of art and sewing, 
and a supervisor of nature study and agriculture. The agricultural 
supervisor is employed for the entire year, the other assistants for the 
school year only. The supervisor of agriculture has oversight of 
instruction in agriculture in the schools and spends his summer 
months in the field with the various boys’ and girls’ agricultural clubs. 
As additional examples, several instances in Tennessee may be 
cited. The Knox County board of education has made the principal 
of the county agricultural high school supervisor of all agricultural 
instruction in the county. He receives $1,800 a year, a house in 
which to live, and a horse with which to travel about the county. 
His work outside of the principalship of the high school is in large 
measure with the grammar grades of the county and with three agri- 
cultural high schools recently established. 
Madison County has a supervisor of agriculture, at a salary of 
$1,200 per year, who supervises science teaching in all of the schools 
and has charge of the agricultural demonstration plots maintained 
at the large schools in the county. His appointment has met with 
great favor among the farmers in the county and the patrons of the 
school. 
Bradley County has a rural school supervisor at a salary of $55 per 
month and expenses. Her work is confined largely to the organiza- 
tion of school-improvement leagues and to work through them for 
the betterment of school buildings. The leagues are raising funds 
for new school buildings and to beautify and make more sanitary the 
old buildings. The supervisor is of great assistance to the schools in 
securing supplies. She also visits as many of the homes of the pupils 
as possible, particularly those who have dropped out of school or
-P-A-G-E-219

whose attendance is irregular, to induce them to attend. She also 
has charge of the girls’ tomato and canning clubs in the county. 
Davidson County has a supervisor of primary work at a salary of 
$70 per month, She is the regular teacher of the primary grades in 
one of the large schools in the county. An assistant is provided for 
her at the school, who teaches the primary grades during her absence. 
She outlines the primary work for all of the schools of the county, 
attends the monthly institutes, and instructs primary teachers in 
methods and subject matter for the next month. She also visits 
schools where her services are most needed. and does what she can to 
improve the instructional work. 
The principal of a central school supervises the surrounding schools 
in several places. In Wabash County, Ind., there is in each town- 
ship a principal, who is required to teach but one-half of his time; 
the other half is devoted to supervising the other schools in the town- 
ship. The principal of a school with two or more teachers is always 
selected. The plan has been in operation for several years and, 
according to the county superintendent, it is giving satisfactory 
results. 
Franklin County, Ky., is divided into four “ educational divisions,” 
each containing from 9 to 14 school districts. Near the center of 
each division is located a school doing seventh and eighth grade 
work and the first two years of high-school work. The principals of 
the central schools are supervising principals of the schools of the 
division and are required to visit them and to assist the teachers. 
In addition, they hold regular meetings for all teachers in the division. 
In Walla Walla County, Wash., the county superintendent in 1909 
divided the county into 12 arbitrary divisions, with one of the larger 
schools at the center of each division. The principals of these central 
schools were made supervising principals of the other schools in the 
division. The principal in each case has very little time to visit the 
other schools, but the teachers meet regularly at the central school for 
discussions under his leadership. The plan has been in operation 
three years, and the results seem to be very satisfactory. 
In Arkansas, three schools, two located in Faulkner County and one 
across the line in Van Buren County, have employed a district super- 
intendent for the past three years. He gives one-third of his time to 
each school, all of which are graded schools with two years of high- 
school work, employing altogether 11 teachers. The superintendent 
spends Monday and Tuesday at one school, Wednesday and Thursday 
at the next, and Friday at the third, returning to his home Friday 
evening. ‘The second week, he spends but one day at the first, two 
at the second, and then two days at the third school. 
In addition to these methods of assisting the county superintendent, 
several plans have been tried to increase the efficiency of the county
-P-A-G-E-220
  166 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
superintendents themselves. In Iowa, a law passed in 1913 provides 
for the appointment of the county superintendents by the school 
directors, instead of election by the people, as formerly. Beginning 
in 1915, the county superintendents will be elected for a three-year term 
by the ‘presidents of the boards of education of each “school town- 
ship, city, town, or village independent district, and each independent 
consolidated district in the county.” Townships divided into inde- 
pendent rural districts have but one vote. The boards of directors 
of the several independent school districts meet and appoint one dele- 
gate to represent the entire township to attend the meeting held for 
the purpose of electing a county superintendent. To be eligible for 
election, candidates must hold a five-year State teacher’s license and 
must have had at least five years’ experience in teaching or super- 
vision. 
A new law in North Dakota providing for the election of county 
superintendents and of the State superintendent directs that the names 
of the candidates be placed on a separate ballot without anything to 
designate the political party to which they belong. In this way it is 
expected to remove the election of school officers from political in- 
fluence. 
Wisconsin, while not materially changing the method of election 
or the powers and duties of the county superintendents, has provided 
a county board of education to oversee the work of the county super- 
intendent. The board fixes the superintendent’s salary, engages and 
fixes the salary of an assistant county superintendent and of an office 
clerk. The county board are therefore in position to require of the 
superintendent a higher grade of efficiency than ever before. 
Until the present year the county superintendents of Alabama have 
never been required to visit and supervise their schools. A new law 
in effect in 1913 requires them to spend their entire time in supervis- 
ing their schools. 
In Arkansas but few county superintendents have been employed 
in the past, but a great effort is making to have each county adopt 
county supervision. Fifteen are now engaged and nine others will 
be elected in 1914. c 
The Texas Legislature considered a bill requiring the employment 
of county superintendents in all counties of the State. In approxi- 
mately 60, or one-fourth of the counties, the county judge is now 
ex officio superintendent of schools. The bill failed to pass. The 
discussion created by the introduction of the bill caused several 
counties to obtain superintendents. 
The State Board of Education of Louisiana held, during the past 
year, a one-week summer school for her parish superintendents. It 
was held at the State University at Baton Rouge, under the immediate 
direction of the State superintendent of public instruction and. the .
-P-A-G-E-221
RURAL EDUCATION. 167 
State supervisor of rural schools. In addition to the parish superin- 
tendents, all assistant superintendents were present, and also the 
teachers of agriculture in the 28 agricultural high schools of the State. 
These teachers have charge of the boys’ agricultural clubs in their 
counties. There were also present the teachers of domestic science 
in the same schools, who are required to supervise the girls’ canning 
clubs in their respective counties, in addition to their high-school 
work. <A feature of the summer school was the instruction given 
in rural education by the State rural-school supervisor, and by the 
State agent in charge of agricultural-club work. A representative of 
the Jeanes fund, part of which is expended in the State for negro 
education, discussed the problem of negro education; and a specialist 
in rural education from the United States Bureau of Education pre- 
sented some of the phases of rural supervision in its broader aspects. 
This idea of a summer school for county superintendents is new. 
Several other States are holding one, two, or three day meetings of 
their county superintendents. They are conferences, however, and 
not schools in which definite instruction is given. A school one week 
in extent, similar to that of Louisiana, was held during the summer 
of 1913 for the county inspectors in the Province of Ontario, Canada, 
by the provincial department of education. The State Teachers’ 
College at Greeley, Colo., gave special work for county superin- 
tendents on rural problems in the summer school during the 1913 
session. A program covering one week was arranged, to which 
county superintendents not enrolled in the regular summer school 
were invited. For four years past the Massachusetts Agricultural 
College has been offering special work in elementary agriculture and 
in rural economics and sociology for rural school superintendents in 
regular summer school courses. In addition, the institution has 
held each year a country-life conference at which much time has 
been devoted to rural-school problems. A special effort has been 
made each year to secure the attendance of rural-school superin- 
tendents. The State normal school at Kirksville, Mo., held during 
the summer of 1913, a conference for county superintendents, to 
which the superintendents of the 25 counties composing the normal 
school district were especially invited. The week consumed by the 
conference was devoted principally to a discussion of ways and means 
of making the work of the county superintendent more efficient. 
County school board conventions.—In several States organized on 
the district or township basis the school trustees are required to 
meet once a year as a county school board convention for the purpose 
of discussing ways and means of improving schools. In every county 
in Pennsylvania the township directors meet in annual convention. 
For this they are allowed a per diem and mileage. The directors 
elect their own officers, who, together with the county superin-
-P-A-G-E-222
  168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
tendent, prepare a program for the day. At each county directors’ 
meeting delegates are appointed to attend the State directors’ meet- 
ing. The effect of these county meetings has been of considerable 
importance in making progress uniform throughout each county. 
The school trustees in Indiana have had meetings somewhat 
similar in purpose. The Legislature of Wisconsin in the 1911 session 
provided for county school board meetings in that State. During the 
past year they were held in every county. Representatives of the 
State department of education attended the meetings. The meetings 
did much to stimulate activities for better rural schools. The 
teachers of the several counties will attend the meetings during the 
present year. 
Each county superintendent in Missouri was authorized by the 
legislature at the 1913 session to call together every year the presi- 
dents and clerks of the district school boards as a county school 
board convention. The delegates to these conventions will receive 
a per diem of $1.50 and mileage (5 cents per mile one way) which will 
be paid from the incidental fund of each school district. 
Several counties in Illinois have county board conventions. Kane 
County has an organization known as the Kane County School 
Officers’ Association. It is open to all school officers of Kane County, 
but the larger number of the active members come from rural and 
village schools, rather than from the city scheols. This organiza- 
tion has been very helpful in increasing interest in school matters 
throughout the county, particularly in the improvements in physical 
conditions. . 
STANDARD RURAL SCHOOLS. 
There is considerable activity in the movement for the improvement 
of the physical conditions of the country and village schools in 
regard to both general appearance and suitability for school pur- 
poses. In several instances the activity was inaugurated and fos- 
tered by State departments of education. In other instances it is 
under the leadership of county boards of education or of county 
superintendents. 
One plan in general use, which has been successfully tried by several 
State departments and by several county superintendents is as 
follows: First, the authorities fix a definition of a ‘‘standard,” 
“superior,” or ‘‘improved’’ school. They then prepare score cards 
on which the schools may be rated; and a banner, diploma, or plate 
is awarded to each school whose score is sufficiently high. In many 
cases the scheme concerns itself not alone with the physical condi- 
tions of the school, but also with the teacher, the course of study, the 
program, and with special features of instructional work. 
The Illinois plan.—In Illinois, where such a plan was put into 
operation by the State department of education in 1911, two grades
-P-A-G-E-223
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 169 
of rural schools and village schools are recognized, ‘‘standard”’ and 
“superior.” A plate bearing the words ‘‘Standard School’’ or 
“Superior School,” is given by the State department to the school 
reaching the required standard. The plate is installed on the front 
of the building, where it may easily be seen by passers-by. A school 
’ is approved and the plate is awarded only after a personal inspection 
by a representative of the,State department of education; and a 
plate may be recalled at any time if the school falls below the fixed 
standard. 
The manner of procedure is as follows: One of the State super- 
visors of rural and village schools, upon the invitation of the county 
superintendent, accompanies him to schools in his county. The 
State official and the county superintendent meet the school direc- 
tors at each school and inspect together the grounds, house, fur- 
nishings, heating, ventilating, library, water supply, outhouses, 
qualifications of the teacher, and the teaching and conduct of the 
school. If the inspection shows satisfactory conditions the diploma 
is awarded; if not, the unsatisfactory conditions are pointed out. 
Of more than 700 schools standardized up to the present time, less 
than one-fifth were up to standard when first inspected. 
The requirements for “standard” schools are as follows:

STANDARD OF WORK. 
1. The work outlined by the State course of study must be well done. 
2. The discipline must make good school work possible and tend to establish sound 
character. 
The Alabama plan.—Alabama has adopted a scheme similar to the 
Illinois plan. Schools there also are approved as ‘‘standard’’ or 
“superior.” They are scored, however, on a percentage basis, a 
maximum of 20 per cent being allowed on buildings and grounds, 
24 per cent on equipment, 26 per cent on ‘‘vitalizing agencies,’ and 
30 per cent on administration. It will be noted from the score card 
reproduced below that special points are offered. Any school scoring 
100 per cent is designated ‘‘standard” and is awarded a special 
diploma by the State department of education. Should a school 
make a total of 120 points, by grading on any or all of the items 
considered on the score card, it is entitled to a diploma as a ‘‘superior 
school.’”’ Schools graded below 100 per cent on the standard school 
basis are ranked as grade A, B, or C, and as ‘‘scrub”’ schools if their 
rank is below 60 per cent. The scoring is done by the State super- 
visor of rural schools if practicable; otherwise by a local committee 
appointed by the State superintendent of public instruction. As the 
points differ somewhat from those given on the Illinois requirements 
above, a copy is included here.

schools upon the same basis. The ‘‘efficiency score card,” as it is

Schools scoring between 90 and 100 points are rated as class A; 
between 80 and 90 as class B; between 70 and 80 as class C; between 
60 and 70 as class D; and below 60 as class E. 
The State department of education has tried also to encourage 
improved physical conditions by designating certain days as ‘‘clean- 
up and beautify days,” and has issued a special score card on which 
the teachers are asked to score their building and grounds after the 
day’s work. A maximum of 15 points is allowed on the card for clean 
yards, 20 for clean floors and walls, 20 for proper decoration, 15 for 
clean windows and suitable conditions of sanitation, 10 for a sanitary 
water supply, and 20 for other general conditions of cleanliness. 
Schools were rated grades A, B, or C, and lists are published showing 
the standing of each school. 
County standardization—The county superintendent of Berks 
County, Pa., Mr. E. M. Rapp, began standardizing his one-room 
country schools some years ago. There are 350 one-teacher schools 
in the county. The standard set is high. The scoring is done by 
the superintendent. A four-page circular is put into the hands of 
each teacher, setting forth 50 minimum requirements for the standard 
school. The teacher and the organization count 75 points, the 
physical equipment, including building, grounds, sanitary arrange- 
ments, etc., 25 points. Approximately 150 of the 350 one-teacher 
schools have come up to the requirements and have received diplo- 
mas. The names of these schools are published in a monthly bulletin 
issued by the county superintendent. Mr. Rapp has the following 
to say concerning the success of the plan: 
Nearly every one of the 350 single-room schools made effort to qualify in some of 
the specified conditions in order eventually to reach the desired goal. Directors are 
vitally interested in the project, and in several instances this resulted in the erection 
of first-class buildings with all modern improvements. It was largely instrumental 
in the installation of 150 sanitary room furnaces, combining a system of heating and 
ventilating, and also in the installation of a number of sanitary bubbling fountains  
-P-A-G-E-228
  174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
for one-room schools. The school code making mandatory the display of the flag, 
planting of trees, and improvements of outbuildings greatly facilitated this movement. 
Similar plans are followed by probably three-fourths of the county 
superintendents of Oregon. Polk County may be taken as a type. 
There wall posters are supplied to the schools, containing a list of 
standard school points. The list is as follows: 
Polk County, Oreg.—Standard school points. 
Flag—Must be flying in good weather. 
Schoolhouse—Properly lighted and ventilated. 
Conditions of schoolroom—Attractive. 
One standard picture—One new picture during the year unless four good ones are 
already in room. 
Drinking water—Hither fountain or tank and individual cups. 
Outbuildings—Sanitary all the time. 
Walks—From road to house; from house to outbuildings. 
Grounds—Drained; attractive; flowers on grounds or in rooms, 
Spelling contests—Every pupil entered. 
’ Discipline—Good order at all times. 
Satisfactory work—On part of both teacher and pupils. 
Attendance—A verage, 95 per cent for year. 
School board—Teacher’s monthly reports must show at least one hour’s visit by 
one or more members of the board each month. 
Teacher—Attending at least 50 per cent of teacher’s institutes and subscribing to 
at least one educational paper. 
When the county superintendent visits the schools he determines 
in what points the school is satisfactory and places a silver star on 
the poster before the point. When the school has been awarded a 
star for each point on the poster, it is given a pennant bearing the 
words, ‘‘Standard School.” 
THE RURAL-SCHOOL TERM. 
Considerable activity has been manifested during the year in 
efforts to increase the length of the rural-school term. In all the 
States the rural term is less than the term for urban schools; in the 
majority of States it is much less. In 1910, the only recent year for 
which data are available concerning the lengths of the term for 
urban schools and for rural schools separately, the average number 
of days in the year for urban schools was 184.3 and for rural schools 
137.7. For the United States as a whole the urban schools were in 
session 46.6 days more than the rural schools. In Rhode Island 
and Connecticut the difference between the urban and rural session 
was 3.8 days, while in South Carolina it was 88.5 days. The aver- 
age number of days in the rural term in the several States ranges 
from 90 in New Mexico to 190 in Rhode Island. Four States—New 
Mexico, North and South Carolina, and Arkansas—had a rural term 
in that year of less than 100 days, while Florida had a term of just
-P-A-G-E-229
  RURAL EDUCATION. 175 
100 days. These averages, however, do not tell the whole story. 
There is much variation above and below the average, and there are 
many school districts, and even many counties, where the school 
term for the past year was not over 60 days. 
During the year 1913 several State legislatures passed enactments 
requiring a longer rural-school term. North Carolina has increased 
the minimum legal school term from four to six months and has pro- 
vided a State equalizing school fund to assist counties in maintaining 
asix months’ term. It has passed also a law compelling every child 
from 8 to 12 years of age to attend continuously for at least four 
months out of the six. New Mexico has increased the minimum 
term to five months by legislative action. Missouri has increased 
the minimum term to eight months and has provided special State 
aid up to $100 per school to assist in carrying out the law. Such aid 
is provided only when the school district is raising by taxation the 
maximum levy permitted by law and is paying a teacher at least $40 
per month. In South Carolina a 1-mill State tax was levied, the 
income of which will constitute the State school fund. Part of this 
fund, the balance after certain specified appropriations are made, 
will be used by the State board of education for lengthening school 
terms. 
In North Dakota a law was passed providing State aid to rural 
schools, the amount of which depends upon the length of term. 
To receive the highest amount, $150, a nine-months’ term is required, 
among other conditions; to receive the next amount, $100, an eight- 
months’ term. Schools maintained less than eight months may not 
receive any of the benefits of the act. A law providing aid for con- 
- solidated schools requires the schools to be maintained nine months 
in order to be eligible to aid from the fund. 
CONSOLIDATION OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
There has been during the year much activity in consolidating one- 
teacher rural schools into single central schools to which the children 
are transported at public expense. In nearly one-third of the States 
recent bulletins have been published by the State department of public 
instruction or by the State universities giving information for those 
working for consolidation. They are an indication of a prevailing 
opinion that consolidation will do much to remedy the present 
unsatisfactory conditions in rural education. 
The extent of the consolidation movement in any locality depends 
in large measure upon the rural-school unit of organization. States 
whose schools are organized with the county basis or the township 
basis are consolidating much more rapidly than those upon the 
district basis. Louisiana, for instance, which is organized on the 
county basis, reports many schools abandoned during the year and  
-P-A-G-E-230
  176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
replaced by consolidated schools. Probably more consolidation has 
been effected there during the past two years than in any other State. 
Lafayette Parish has few one-teacher schools left, and they will soon 
be abandoned, for no child in the county lives now at a greater distance 
than 5 miles from a consolidated school. St. John the Baptist Parish 
reports that now it has no schools with less than three teachers. 
Tennessee, also on the county basis, reports that 150 small schools 
were closed during the year and grouped into approximately 50 
larger units; in but few cases are the children transported at public 
expense. In several other counties, however, consolidated schools 
have been established with public transportation. 
Mississippi has. organized 75 consolidated schools during the year, 
whose children are transported in 100 wagons. The average area 
of the 75 consolidated districts is 30 square miles; the 75 buildings 
erected cost approximately $140,000. In three years there have been 
organized in the State 175 consolidated schools, in connection with 
which 240 school wagons are used. In the past year Pearl River 
County replaced 31 schools with 6 consolidated schools, to which 
children are transported in 21 school wagons; Harrison County, one 
of the largest in the State, has 15 consolidated schools, and only 
30 one-teacher schools are left. 
The county board of education of Box Elder County, Utah, has 
during the past year erected 11 new school buildings, ata total cost of 
$205,000, which take the place of over 30 old buildings. Twenty 
wagons have been put into operation to carry the children from the 
abandoned schools. The high-school work is all concentrated in one 
large school at Brigham City. Transportation to a maximum of 
$2 a week is allowed students outside of Brigham City, thus equalizing ° 
in part the cost of high-school education throughout the county. 
West Virginia, which is organized on the magisterial district basis, 
corresponding very closely to the township basis, reports over 100 
schools abandoned and replaced by consolidated schools. 
Progress in consolidation in States organized on the single district 
plan has been necessarily slow. In Colorado, as an example, although 
great effort has been made to consolidate schools, only six consolida- 
tions have been effected during the year. Minnesota, however, has 
made considerable progress, in spite of the district organization. 
This has been due largely to special State aid for consolidated schools 
provided by an act of the legislature, known as the Holmberg Act, 
which became effective April 18, 1911. 
Some of the provisions of this act are the following: 
(a) It requires on the petition for election the signatures of only 25 per cent of the 
resident freeholders in each district to be included in the consolidation.
-P-A-G-E-231
  RURAL EDUCATION. 1G 
(b) Consolidation shall be effected by a majority vote of all districts involved to 
be cast at one central meeting, whereas the former law left the districts to vote sepa- 
rately on the question. 
(c) The standard for teachers in consolidated schools is as high as for those of any 
school in the State. 
(d) The principals must have the special indorsement of the State superintendent 
of public instruction. 
(e) The State superintendent has the authority to set standards for school buildings 
and for equipment, as a condition for State aid. 
({) The State superintendent may make regulations for the transportation of children. 
(g) Finally, generous State aid is provided for the consolidated schools which meet 
the approval of the State department of education. 
Schools in consolidated districts are classified as A, B, and C. 
Each must maintain a session at least eight months in the year, 
must be well organized, and suitable buildings and equipment must 
be furnished. Class A schools must have at least four departments; 
that is, four teachers; class B schools, three departments, and class C 
schools, two departments. The principal of a class A school must 
hold a diploma from an advanced course of a State normal school and 
be qualified to teach the elements of agriculture as determined by 
such directions as are made by the superintendent of public in- 
struction. A school of this class must have room and equipment for 
industrial work. The principal of a class B or a class C school must 
hold at least a State first-grade certificate and possess such qualifica- 
tions as are required for teachers in the State graded schools. Class 
A schools receive annually from the State $1,500, class B schools 
$1,000, class C schools $750; and in addition to such annual aid a 
school in any of the above classes may receive, to aid in the construe- 
tion of a building, 25 per cent of the cost of the building up to $1,500. 
The efficacy of the law may be judged by the number of consolida- 
tions effected. From 1900 to 1911, before the Holmberg Act was in 
effect, only 9 consolidations were effected in the State. In the first 
year after the passage of the act 60 communities organized under 
its provisions; 30 of these met the requirements in time to secure 
State aid for the school year 1911-12; the remaining 30 received aid 
for the school year 1912-13. These 60 districts were formed by 
the consolidation of 141 old districts. Twenty-one of the new 
districts, however, became consolidated school districts under the 
provisions of the Holmberg Act without increasing in any way the 
size of the school district. They already contained more than the 12 
sections of land required for consolidated schools of class C and were 
employing two or more teachers. This means, therefore, that 39 
districts now replace 120. 
The Missouri Legislature in 1913 passed a measure intended to 
promote consolidation, following the Minnesota plan. The Missouri 
17726°—xp 19138-——vor 1——12 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
178 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
law provides that the consolidated district must contain at least 12 
square miles of territory and 200 children of school age. Consolida- 
tion is effected on the majority vote of the qualified voters of the 
proposed consolidated district at one central meeting. This meeting 
may decide also whether or not public transportation will be fur- 
nished. However, if transportation is not provided, a school must 
be maintained within 2} miles by road from the home of every child 
of school age. The consolidated school must have a site of at least 
5 acres of land and a school building with a general assembly room, 
which may be used for public meetings of the citizens of the district. 
The State will pay one-fourth of the cost of the building up to $2,000 
and also will pay annually toward the maintenance of the school $25 
for each square mile in the consolidated district. This is with the 
provision, however, that the consolidated school maintain at least a 
third-grade high school giving one year’s work in agriculture. 
The 1913 Legislature of Iowa, to encourage the consolidation of 
rural schools, voted to give $250 for equipment and $200 annually 
for each consolidated school of two rooms teaching agriculture, home 
economics, or other industrial or vocational subjects and approved 
by, the State superintendent of public instruction. Consolidated 
schools of three rooms will receive from the State $350 for equipment 
and $500 annually; those with four or more rooms, $500 for equip- 
ment and $500 annually. 
The Tennessee Legislature of 1913 gave each county board of edu- 
cation full power and authority to consolidate schools and to provide 
public transportation. Ten per cent of the general educational fund 
of the State may be used to aid industrial work in country schools 
and to assist the establishment of consolidated schools with three or 
more teachers. 
LIMITING THE NUMBER OF GRADES IN RURAL SCHOOLS. 
The movement for consolidated schools goes hand in hand with the 
movement to limit the number of grades in accordance with the num- 
ber of teachers. This is largely because the principal argument for 
consolidation is to obtain more efficient schools than is possible in 
the one-teacher school system. The one-teacher school is inefficient 
in comparison with the consolidated school, other things being equal, 
because the teacher has pupils in too many grades and is required to 
conduct more classes during the day than there is sufficient time for, 
When the number of grades is limited to four or five, the one-teacher 
school, if in a suitable building with a qualified teacher, may be effi- 
cient. When the number of grades is limited, the school authorities 
must make provision for the children after they have completed the 
grades given. The question of limiting the number of grades has 
been considered very seriously in several parts of the country during  
-P-A-G-E-233
RURAL EDUCATION. 179 
the past year or two, but particularly in Louisiana. Several parish 
boards of education have taken up the question and have passed 
suitable regulations. The usual limit for the one-teacher school in 
Louisiana, wherever a limit is set, is five grades, and for the two- 
teacher schools seven or eight grades. St. Johns Parish, with no 
schools with less than three teachers, limits the three-teacher schools 
to seven grades. Other parishes which have already adopted grade 
limits are St. Martin, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Ascension, St. 
James, Winn, West Feliciana, Lafayette, Terrebonne, and Union. 
Tn all of these parishes provisions have been made for accommodating 
advanced pupils at some central point in the parish. 
The State of North Carolina, while not limiting the number of 
grades in the one-teacher schools, provides that high-school branches 
may not be taught in one-teacher schools, and that they may be 
taught in schools having more than one teacher only after adequate 
provision has been made for the thorough teaching of the elementary 
branches. This, in effect, prohibits any one-teacher school from 
maintaining more than seven grades of work. 
Franklin County, Ky., in practice limits the number of grades in 
the rural schools to six. The county is divided into four educational 
divisions, each division containing from 9 to 14 subdistrict schools. 
In each division there has been established a central school for all the 
children in the division in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. 
For the last two years of high-school work the children go to the high 
school at Frankfort. 
In Lavaca County, Tex., the rural schools have been classified by a 
board of five members, of which the county superintendent is secre- 
tary. No teacher is permitted to teach more than six grades. 
Schools with seven or eight grades are required to employ two teach- 
ers. If the attendance is above 100 pupils, three teachers must be 
employed. Districts with a large census enrollment, employing but 
one teacher, are limited to five grades. Children above the fifth 
grade are transferred at public expense to some other district with 
higher grades. 
THE CLASSIFICATION OF RURAL SCHOOLS. 
The Legislature of North Dakota in the 1913 session made pro- 
vision for classifying rural schools into three classes by providing 
special State aid for those who have reached the requirements of what 
are designated as ‘Class one” and “Class two.” The schools not 
meeting the requirements of class one or class two constitute a third 
class. A first-class rural school is one maintained nine months during 
the school year, taught by an experienced teacher holding a first-grade 
certificate; the school building must be suitable and the State 
course of study, which includes agriculture, must be used. These
-P-A-G-E-234
  180 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
schools receive annual State aid of $150. A second-class rural school 
must meet the same requirements as far as the building and course 
of study are concerned, but it may employ a teacher holding a 
second-grade certificate and school may be maintained only eight 
months. Such schools receive $100 annually from the State. 
This plan is similar to that adopted in Minnesota by act of the 
legislature in 1905 and amended in 1909 and 1911. The Minnesota 
schools are classed as A, B, or C, as follows: 
Class A.—Districts employing a teacher holding at least a first-grade 
certificate and maintaining school not less than eight months in the 
school year. 
Class B.—Districts employing a teacher holding at least a second- 
grade certificate and maintaining school not less than eight months 
jn the school year. 
Class C.—Districts employing a teacher holding at least a second- 
grade certificate and maintaining school not less than seven months 
in the school year. 
Provided the schools have suitable buildings, libraries, and other 
apparatus and conveniences, and comply with such rules as may be 
fixed by the State superintendent of public instruction for maintain- 
ing an efficient school, those in class A receive annually from the 
State $150, class B, $100, and class C, $75. The plan has worked 
well, and school trustees are providing better buildings and equip- 
ment, better teachers, and a longer term in order that their schools 
may be rated as high as possible and receive the greater State aid 
coming with the higher classification. The tendency is shown by the 
following table, giving the number of schools in 1911 and in 1912, in 
class A and class B, and in 1912 in class C.

  RURAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The movement for the establishment of high schools in the smaller 
villages or in the open country is making rapid progress. Utah 
reports that over 40 rural and town high schools were organized 
during the year. Previously most of the high-school work outside 
of the larger cities has been done by church academies. The activity 
in establishing high schools in that State is the result largely of a 
special legislative grant passed in the 1911 session of the legislature. 
A high-school inspector has been appointed who is also a member of 
the faculty of the State university.
-P-A-G-E-235
        RURAL EDUCATION. 181 
Special State aid for rural high schools was provided in 1913 by the 
Legislature of Missouri. In order to receive this aid a school district 
must be organized as a town, city, or consolidated school district, 
and have six school directors. It must levy for school purposes the 
maximum levy provided by law, which is 100 cents on $100. The 
school must do at least two years of approved high-school work and 
employ a competent principal. Each of its teachers must receive at . 
least $40 a month for eight months in the year, and the school must 
have maintained an average daily attendance of 15 pupils during the 
past year. The course must include one year in agriculture. Any 
high school meeting these conditions on June 30 of any year may 
make application for State aid. If the work is approved, the State 
aid may be given as follows: A district whose assessed valuation 
is less than $300,000 may receive $800 per year; if its valuation is - 
between $300,000 and $400,000, $600 per year; if between $400,000 
and $600,000, $400 per year; if over $600,000, $200 per year. For 
any county in which there is no school district with a valuation of 
over $300,000 and, no high school with an average attendance of 15 
pupils or more, the State has made special provision. One district 
in the county with a village or consolidated organization with six 
school directors may receive $800 annually, provided the maximum 
local tax levy is assessed and the school employs a competent 
principal. 
The State of Louisiana is encouraging high schools located in rural 
sections to become rural schools in fact as well as in name by teaching 
country-life subjects. There are now in operation 28 high schools 
with departments of agriculture, each of which receives from the 
State $1,000 annually for this department. Double that number of 
schools have filed application with the State department for State 
aid for the coming year, certifying that they have the land, equip- 
ment, and facilities for instruction specified by the State department. 
There are 20 country high schools with departments of household 
science. Each of these departments receives from the State treas- 
urer $500 per year. Many additional schools have applied for aid 
for the coming year. Each teacher of agriculture in these agricul- 
tural departments is required, in addition to his work in the high 
schools, to supervise the boys’ corn and hog clubs in the parish under 
the general direction of the parish superintendent of schools. The 
teachers of domestic science supervise the girls’ tomato and canning 
clubs. 
A new type of State-aided agricultural departments in public high 
schools has been inaugurated in Louisiana. Ten schools, with from 
three to five teachers each, located in different parts of the State, 
have been selected. Each school will receive from the State $100 
annually. Each must employ a teacher of agriculture, who shall
-P-A-G-E-236

spend part of his time, including Saturdays, in supervising agricul- 
tural home-project work and club work done at the homes of the 
pupils as a part of regular school work. These agricultural schools 
have no school farms, but depend upon the home farm. The schools 
have hotbeds, from which the pupils may be supplied with early plants 
for their home-project gardens. 
Mississippi has invested in agricultural high schools during the 
past three years approximately $1,000,000. This money has been 
raised by bonds, taxes, and subseription. 
TRAINING TEACHERS FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Throughout the country there has been a marked interest in pro- 
viding better means for giving professional training to young men 
and women preparing to teach in the country schools. The training 
courses for country teachers offered in 1912 by the State normal 
schools were described in a recent bulletin of the Bureau of Educa- 
tion Since that time many State normal schools have introduced 
such courses. Among them might be mentioned the six State nor- 
mal schools of Oklahoma, which have adopted a uniform course for 
rural teachers, and the State normal school at Natchitoches, La., 
which has established a special course for country teachers of equal 
length and value with other normal courses. Two hundred pupils 
were enrolled in this course during the year ended in June, 1913, the 
first year of the course. The new normal school at Hattiesburg, 
Miss., has adopted courses intended to fit particularly for rural teach- 
ing, and the new normal school opened during the year at Valdosta, 
Ga., has done likewise. 
The State of Wisconsin, which assists in maintaining county train- 
ing schools in 27 counties for training rural teachers, has authorized 
the establishment of similar schools in six additional counties. A 
county training school may not be established in a county in which 
a State normal school is located. However, five of the State normal 
schools are conducting special classes for preparing rural teachers, 
which are of the same grade and operate under the same general 
regulations as the county training schools. 
Training courses for rural-school teachers may be established in 
high schools in counties of Wisconsin in which no county training 
school exists. The establishment of training courses, both in special 
schools and in high schools, has been stimulated by the action of the 
legislature of 1913, which provided that after July 1, 1915, no per- 
son shall be allowed to teach in the State of Wisconsin who has not 
had at least two years’ instruction beyond the elementary school 
course, one year of which shal! include professional preparation for

RUBAL EDUCATION. 183 
teaching. The county training schools for rural teachers in Wiscon- 
sin will be in the future under the management of the county board 
of education provided by an act of the legislature approved in August, 
1913. As this board of education will have general oversight of the 
schools of the county and of the county superintendent, a closer 
articulation between the county training schools and the public 
schools may be expected. 
Following the example of 13 other States which have ‘been in the 
past conducting teacher-training departments either in connection 
with or in public high schools, the State of Missouri, by action of the 
legislature of 1913, provided for similar work in that State. The 
professional courses will be given in the eleventh and twelfth grades 
of certain first-class approved high schools. State aid will be given, 
amounting to $750 annually for each school. If more than one school 
is approved in the same county, $1,200 annually will be divided 
between them. The law requires that there must be at least 10 
pupils in the training class. The management of the training depart- 
ments is given to the State superintendent. He is empowered to 
prescribe the entrance requirements, outline the course, dictate the 
methods of instruction, and fix the requirements for graduation. 
Upon the satisfactory completion of the course he may grant a cer- 
tificate, which is a valid license to teach in any public elementary or 
rural school for two years. A State inspector of teacher training in 
high schools has been appointed, who will have immediate oversight 
of the schools introducing these professional courses. 
Teacher-training courses in public high schools were established in 
Towa in 1911 and have graduated two classes. The legislature of 
1913, apparently feeling that the State is now in the position to live 
up to the law, provided that after July 1, 1915, every applicant for 
a teacher’s certificate must have had at least 12 weeks of normal 
training, either in a college, normal school, summer school, or in the 
professional department of a public high school. In order to encour- 
age better-trained teachers, a minimum wage has been fixed by the 
legislature, as follows: (1) Any teacher holding a first-grade county 
certificate shall receive a daily wage of not less than 3 cents multi- 
plied by the general average shown on the certificate. (2) Any 
teacher holding a second-grade county certificate shall receive not 
less than 2?-cents multiplied by the general average shown on her 
certificate up to 85 per cent. (3) Any teacher holding a third-grade 
county certificate shall receive a daily wage of not less than 24 cents 
multiplied by the general average shown on her certificate. 
Tennessee, with its facilities for training teachers, increased by the 
opening of the three State normal schools for white teachers and one 
for negro teachers, now requires that all certificates to teach shall be  
-P-A-G-E-238
  184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
granted by the State superintendent, and that candidates must be 
at least 18 years of age. 
Summer schools—One of the most important agencies in the im- 
provement of teachers already in service is the summer school. In 
the summer of 1912 there were held in the United States 569 sum- 
mer schools, with an enrollment of 142,217 students. The great 
majority of these students were in teachers’ training courses, and 
were engaged either in the study of subjects which they were teach- 
ing, or expected to teach, or in professional work in education and 
methods. A large number were rural teachers. Many summer 
schools, especially those of State normal schools and State colleges 
of agriculture, are giving courses particularly for preparation for 
rural teaching. The Teachers’ College of Columbia University con- 
ducts a special department of rural education, which has been during 
the past year under the direction of Dr. Ernest Burnham, director 
of the department of rural education of the State Normal School at 
Kalamazoo, Mich. Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore, dur- 
ing the summer of 1913 conducted a department of rural education. 
The State Teachers’ College, of Greeley, Colo., gave during the past 
summer a six weeks’ course especially for rural teachers and for county 
superintendents. : 
Considerable attention to the question of training rural teachers 
has been given the past few years by the Conference for Education 
in the South. A section on the training and certification of teachers 
after careful study, recommended, at the meeting held in Richmond 
in April, 1913, that the Southern States make wider use of the high- 
school teacher-training department. The plan has been tried in high 
schools in three Southern States. Virginia has had such courses in 
24 schools since 1908, and the plan has been successful. Arkansas 
introduced professional courses for preparation for teaching in 11 
schools in September, 1911; North Carolina, in a few schools the 
same year. The section recommends that every Southern State 
enact legislation providing that certain strong country high schools 
be selected by the State department of education to give these 
courses in preparation for rural teaching under the management and 
control of the State department and supported in part from State 
funds. The recommendations relative to the conditions governing 
the courses are as follows: Em 
It is the belief of the majority of the conference of high-school inspectors that if spe- 
cific teacher training for rural teachers is to be undertaken by the high schools of the 
South it should be done somewhat under the following conditions: 
First. It should be done in a distinct class, following the high-school course, and. 
open to pupils of sufficient age and experience after the second year of high-school 
training. 
Second. It should be under the immediate charge of an expert elementary teacher 
and the principal.
-P-A-G-E-239
  RURAL EDUCATION. 185 
Third. The year’s work should cover the subject matter of the rural school and the 
State syllabus. 
Fourth. Observation and practice should be given in the grades and neighboring 
rural schools, with criticism, bringing in the principles of education, laws of psychol- 
ogy, methods and management in the doing, with supplementary texts. 
Fifth. The high-school equipment in laboratories, vocational departments, library, 
or other equipment should be utilized fully as needed. 
Sixth. Cooperation with the boys’ and girls’ clubs in agriculture and domestic 
science through the supervisors of these should be secured, developing capacity for 
outdoor life and outdoor studies. 
Seventh. The State should appropriate additional funds or set aside from the pres- 
ent school funds at least $500 a school for a limited number of training classes in 
different sections of the State, the town and county together duplicating the State 
appropriation, and providing the necessary accommodations. 
Eighth. These departments must be supervised by the State and meet definite 
requirements to receive the appropriation. 
Ninth. Graduates of the training classes are to be given elementary certificates good 
for two years and renewable under certain conditions. 
Tenth. Teachers in the field may attend the classes for any period of the year 
when not engaged in teaching and elect additional work in the high school.    
THE ELIMINATION OF RURAL ILLITERACY. 
Figures from the 1910 Census concerning the number of illiterates 
10 years of age and over in the United States show that the rural rate 
of illiteracy is practically twice as great as the urban rate of illiter- 
acy, the figures being 10.1 and 5,2 per cent, respectively. The rate 
of rural illiteracy is greater than the urban in 34 States and less in 
14. In the 34 States the rural illiteracy is from one to three and a 
half times as great as the urban. The 14 States where the rural 
illiteracy is less than the urban illiteracy are the New England States 
and New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Nebraska, 
and Kansas. 
Tho higher rate of rural illiteracy is due in large measure to the 
lack of proper school facilities in the rural districts. The higher rate 
of rural illiteracy in the Southern States can not be laid to the negro 
population, because for the entire group of Southern States the rate 
of illiteracy among rural whites is three times the rate among urban 
whites, and the rate among rural whites is greater in every individual 
Southern State than among urban whites. The rate of illiteracy 
among rural negroes in the same States, while nearly seven times the 
rate for the rural whites, is only one and one-half times the rate of 
illiteracy among urban negroes. 
These facts, brought out by the last Federal Census, have resulted 
in several movements for the elimination of at least a part of tne 
rural illiteracy. These movements include special schools for adults 
and for boys and girls either too old or unable for any reason to 
attend regular school. Night schools have been common in cities in
-P-A-G-E-240
    186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
all parts of the United States for many years. Rural night schools, 
however, are comparatively new and exist in only a few sections. 
The extension service of the Massachusetts Agricultural College 
. began in 1910 a movement to teach the illiterate immigrant farm 
hands, especially those employed on the tobacco and onion farms in 
the Connecticut Valley, to read and write. The work is done in 
cooperation with local school authorities, who give the use of the 
school building and furnish books and supplies. The college furnishes 
the teachers, who in all cases are volunteers from the student body 
and teach without pay. The schools are in session, as a rule, two 
nights during the week, as the student-teachers are required to keep 
up their regular college studies. The schools are necessarily within 
a radius of 10 or 15 miles from the college, so that they are easily 
accessible to the student-teachers. In four schools, attended by 
Polish pupils during the past year, nine teachers gave instruction. 
The average attendance was 80. 
Another notable and successful experiment in rural night schools 
was in Rowan County, Ky. In September, 1911, night schools were 
opened in every rural school in the county, through the efforts and 
inspiration of Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart, the county superintendent. 
About 1,200 persons, from 18 to 86 years of age, or nearly one-third 
of the total population of the county between those ages, attended 
the first year. Schools were in session the first four nights every 
week during the school year. The regular teachers gave their services 
for this extra work without additional pay. Reading, writing, arith- 
metic, and spelling were taught. The second year 1,600 persons 
were enrolled. The plan has been adopted by about 10 of the counties 
in Kentucky.! ; 
The State superintendent of Tennessee inaugurated a campaign 
for the eradication of illiteracy immediately after the census figures 
became available. He asked his county superintendents to assist 
in this undertaking and suggested to them the plan followed by Mrs. 
Stewart in Kentucky. While more or less was done throughout the 
State, only two counties—Bradley in east Tennessee and Sumner in 
middle Tennessee—entered upon the task in real earnestness. In 
Bradley County during the past year approximately 20 night schools, 
composed exclusively of illiterate adults, were held. The attendance 
ranged from 4 to 23. The men and women taking the course were 
very enthusiastic and spoke in highest terms of benefits they re- 
ceived and of the consecration and zeal of their teachers. 
In Sumner County about 30 special schools for illiterates were held 
during the year. Some of them were night schools; others met on 
Saturday afternoons; and some were held in connection with the 
regular Sunday schools. Church people and ieading citizens came

-P-A-G-E-241
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 187 
to the aid of the teachers, and the work was successful, not only in 
eliminating part of the illiteracy, but also in bringing the school into 
more favorable attention on the part of the community than ever 
before. During the past year a few special schools were held in 
Anderson County, and many other county superintendents have de- 
clared their intention of doing likewise during the next year. 
An. interesting experiment was made in Virginia during the past 
two years which has been successful and will undoubtedly be adopted 
in many other places. Irish Creek Hollow is in a mountain valley in 
Rockbridge County and is inhabited by mountaineers of original stock 
who have intermarried as much as the law permits. The valley is 
inaccessible and is sparsely settled. The homes are log cabins, whose 
chief fault lies in their cramped quarters. With plenty of woodland 
all around, log houses of sufficient size may be easily built. The 
need is not so much the means as the will to do better things. The 
community has had a school building for several years, but no school. 
After the building was erected it was used as a schoolhouse for only 
a very few years, because no teacher could be found who would 
endure the discomforts and isolation of the region. Three years ago 
the school board offered the place successively to 21 teachers in a 
desperate effort to do something for the community. Their efforts 
were unavailing. Then they adopted another plan. 
In the summer of 1911 two of the best teachers of the county were 
induced by the school board and the county superintendent to go to 
this valley and establish a summer school upon closing their regular 
schools. Taking with them a 12-year-old boy as an assistant, they 
earried provisions, cooking utensils, and tents in which to live. 
School was opened in the old school building. The attendance far 
exceeded the expectations of the teachers, and a neighboring church 
was also used. There were approximately 80 children enrolled in 
morning classes and from 30 to 40 adults in the afternoon and evening 
classes. Among the children enrolled in the morning school all but 
six were beginners or in the first reader. The interest in the school 
on the part of the residents of the valley was very great. They built 
an additional schoolroom and two comfortable living rooms for the 
teachers. A church near by had been begun several years before, 
but was not completed until the establishment of the summer school, 
when it was completed and used both for religious services and as a 
schoolroom. Money was raised in the community, and an organ was 
purchased for the church, which was used for the school also. 
The secretary of the Virginia Cooperative Education Association 
visited the school during the 1912 session and organized a school and 
civic league and an athletic association, both of which were open to 
all residents of the community. Practically all the people in the 
community of school age and over joined the civic league. Only 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
188 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
one person among the members had ever gone far enough in school 
to study common fractions. 
At one session the teachers were accompanied by a theological 
student, who conducted religious services in the church and assisted 
in the social welfare work of the school. A Sunday-school class was 
organized and taught by the regular teachers. The result of the 
entire experiment after three years has been satisfactory. The credit 
for beginning the work belongs to the county superintendent and the 
school trustees. 
The State department of public instruction of Virginia is making a 
survey of the mountain sections of Virginia at the present time and 
proposes to conduct many summer schools during the coming year 
like the one which has been held at Irish Creek Hollow. 
PUPILS’ READING CIRCLES. 
In order to encourage wider and more general reading on the part 
of rural children, including those both in and out of school, in several 
States pupils’ reading circles have been organized. As an example 
of this the Alabama reading circle may be described. In that State 
the pupils’ reading circle is a part of the teachers’ reading circle and 
was inaugurated as a result of the action of the State educational 
association in 1909. The work is under the direction of the board 
of directors who have the teachers’ circle incharge. It is composed 
of six persons elected by the association and the State superintend- 
ent of public instruction. A law which became operative in March, 
1912, provides State aid for libraries in rural, town, and village 
schools not located in towns of 1,000 population or more. The State 
contributes $10 to each school, providing the county and the local 
school district contribute $10 each, the $30 to be used for the pur- 
chase of a rural-school library. This money must be expended for 
books from an approved list prepared by the State superintendent 
of public instruction. Since the adoption of the law 754 libraries 
have been established. 
The young people’s course contemplates the use of the library so 
obtained. Teachers are encouraged to organize their schools into 
reading clubs. The State department has published a list containing 
nine complete sets of books, each containing books suited to the 
various grades. Each complete set costs $10. Each pupil in the 
reading circle is expected to read three books from those of his own 
grade. A certificate is granted to each one who does so. Kansas 
and Ohio have similar reading circles. Books may be obtained in 
Ohio from the State librarian for the use of the reading circles. They 
are shipped to reading circles in any part of the State without expense, 
except for express charges. In this way the rural children have good 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
RURAL EDUCATION. 189 
books accessible at a very low cost, and the circles encourage them to 
read. 
As examples of similar work, local, rather than State-wide in ex- 
tent, the following instances may be mentioned: 
The superintendent of schools of the township of Warren, Mass., 
to encourage pupils to read has arranged a list of 450 books in the 
public library suitable for the various grades. The grades are in- 
dicated for which each book is suited. The teachers in the schools 
located away from the public library assist the children in getting the 
books. 
The county superintendent of Brown County, S. Dak., has secured 
800 supplementary readers for grades 1 to 6, which are sent to rural 
teachers for the use of the children. 
“Literary diplomas” are issued by the district superintendent of 
District No. 1, Montgomery County, N. Y., to every child ‘in the 
supervisory district who reads 10 books during the year from a list 
compiled by the superintendent, commits to memory 6 poems 
required for the English work of the grade, and writes a letter to the 
district superintendent describing the book which he likes best. 
SCHOOL FUNDS. 
Some of the important changes in methods of raising and dis- 
tributing State and county school funds are noted below: 
One-third of the gross revenue of the State of Tennessee now con- 
stitutes the general education fund. Until the present year it was 
25 per cent of the total revenue of the State. Ten per cent of the 
general education fund is now set aside for encouraging the introduc- 
tion of industrial work, including agriculture, household sciences, and 
manual training in county elementary schools and for providing 
adequate supervision of the same. It may also be used for encourag- 
ing the establishment of consolidated sehools, with transportation 
at public expense. No part of this money, however, may be used 
in a county whose levy is less than 40 cents on the $100 and which* 
does not collect a $2 poll tax and all of the special taxes which the 
State laws permit. The State will pay to such counties one-half of 
the salary of a county industrial supervisor. Also it will pay part 
of the cost of maintenance of consolidated schools with three teachers 
or more. 
South Carolina has provided for a 1-mill tax on all real and per- 
sonal property, to be used for school purposes. This constitutes 
the State school fund. One-half of it is retained in the counties 
in which it is raised and may be used by the county boards of educa- 
tion for school purposes ‘‘in the discretion of the board.” The other 
half is paid to the State treasurer and is used by him to cover 
warrants of the State board of education. The law provides that 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  190 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
$60,000 a year shall be used for high schools in the State, $60,000 for 
the extension of public schools, $20,000 for consolidated graded 
schools, $5,000 for rural libraries, and the remainder shall be used by 
the State board of education in lengthening school terms. 
In order to inerease the rural school term to a minimum of six 
months, North Carolina has provided a “State equalizing school 
fund.” There is set aside annually 5 per cent of the annual tax 
levied and collected for State purposes on all real and personal 
property in the State. This will be distributed among the counties 
of the State which have complied with all of the requirements of a 
previous law providing a school term of four months in’ each school 
district It is to be disbursed so as to equalize the school terms in 
these counties and bring the term in each legal school district to a 
minimum of six months. The money may be used only for the salaries 
of teachers, and the amount paid from this fund shall not exceed $40 
per month for any first-grade teacher, $30 for any second-grade 
teacher, and $20 for any third-grade teacher. 
A movement is gaining headway in Louisiana to make the parish 
(county) the unit of taxation for the maintenance of public schools. 
At present the State distributes the State funds to the parishes on 
the basis of the school population. The State appropriation is the 
income from a 1}-mill tax. The parishes must levy a 3-mill tax. 
Supplementary funds have been raised by local school-district taxes. 
Eleven parishes during the year have voted additional parish taxes 
for the purposes of maintenance, and will use the local district as a 
unit of taxation only for special purposes. 
In West Virginia a new law makes the county superintendent the 
county financial secretary. It requires that all orders of whatever 
sort issued by the magisterial boards of education must be counter- 
signed by the county superintendents before payments are made. 
This virtually makes the county the controlling unit in the adminis- 
tration of rural school affairs. 
THE SOCIAL AND CIVIC CENTER MOVEMENT. 
The various organizations mentioned in the following paragraphs, 
most of which meet at the schoolhouses, are all-important factors in 
making the rural school the social and civic center of the school 
district. Considerable agitation for the use of rural schoolhouses for 
such purposes is apparent in all parts of the United States. In 
Wisconsin especially the rural schoolhouse has come into use for 
public meetings very generally. This has been due in part to the 
work of the bureau of social and civic center development of the State 
University, but perhaps more directly to the work of the State depart- 
ment of education, whose representatives to the county school-board 
conventions during the past year made a special point of discussing  
-P-A-G-E-245
  RURAL EDUCATION. 191 
the wider use of the school plant. The department also has published 
a bulletin which it is putting into the hands of the rural school teachers 
and school trustees, containing suggestions for using the schoolhouse 
for public meetings. 
The West Virginia State department of education has issued a 
similar publication. It was prepared especially for the use of teachers 
and contains 25 special programs which may be used in arranging 
community meetings at schoolhouses. The programs are for adults, 
not school children. They are on such subjects as local history, good 
roads, sanitation, etc. 
There has been considerable activity in this social-center movement 
in the States of the Northwest, particularly in Washington, Oregon, 
and Idaho. One plan of creating rural community centers in Wash- 
ington is worthy of note. In 1909 Walla Walla County was divided 
by the county superintendent into 12 groups or districts, with one of 
the larger schoolhouses at the center of each district. This school 
was made the community center as far as possible. The movement 
began by aseries of contests in spelling and declamations. All the 
patrons in the group were invited to the meetings at the central school. 
Next the contests in spelling and declamations were supplemented by 
contests in sewing and cooking, and then by other programs, includ- 
ing lecture courses and discussions by local people on subjects of 
interest in the community. One outgrowth of the work has been a 
large number of school fairs held at the central schools in which the 
children from the surrounding schools took part. It has resulted also 
in uniting the school districts in spirit and sympathy, and will prob- 
ably result in many cases in consolidating the smaller one-room schools 
with the central school. : 
In Newton County, Mo., three days are recognized as school 
community days: Parents’ day, school day, and graduation day. 
On “‘parents’ day” the people gather at the schoolhouse for a picnic 
and a general social gathering, and also to discuss educational affairs 
and things needed for the improvement of school. For educational 
purposes the county is divided into seven districts; each of these 
centers around a village, and it is here that the “‘school-day” exercises 
are held. The day’s program includes a teachers’ institute in the 
morning, followed by public contests in declamation and spelling and 
in athletics later in the day. Many exhibits are displayed of the 
work of the schools. A feature of the program is the school parade, 
in which the children in the various schools march. On “ graduation 
day ”’ the pupils finishing the work of the eighth grade gather at the 
county seat to receive their diplomas in the presence of a large 
gathering of parents and other interested persons.

  192 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
SCHOOL FAIRS. 
From all over the United States come reports of school fairs held 
in individual school districts, in township districts, and in county 
districts. In many cases they are institutions separate and distinct; 
in other cases they are departments of agricultural fairs. Virginia 
probably holds more school fairs separate from other gatherings than 
any other State. In that State the fairs are held with the county as 
the unit. There were during the past summer approximately 50 
county school fairs in 50 counties out of the 100 in the State. 
The movement in Virginia originated in 1907 with the Federation 
of Women’s Clubs of the State. The superintendent of Campbell 
County took up the suggestion and held the first county school fair 
of the State at Rustburg, the county seat of Campbell County, on 
October 28, 1908. The event was not a large one, but it proved such 
a success that it was decided immediately to hold another the next 
year. The number of exhibits sent to the second fair was too large 
for the county courthouse and they were transferred to the largest 
building in town. In 1910, the third year, the fair was a greater 
success still. No building could be found large enough to hold the 
exhibits, and a tent was pitched upon the green in front of the court- 
house. At the close of this fair a movement was started by the people 
of the county to provide a permanent school-fair hall. Funds were 
raised by contribution, by entertainments given in the schools, and 
by a supplemental appropriation by the county. A building was 
erected which was ready for use in 1911. It is a two-story building, 
44 by 884 feet. The lower story is an exhibit hall; the upper story 
an auditorium for public exercises. The total cost was $3,100. The 
county school board appropriated $1,000, the county board of super- 
visors $500, and $1,600 was raised in other ways. 
The Campbell County school fair of 1911, the first held in the new 
building, was in keeping with the new quarters. In 1908, 24 prizes 
had been offered, with a total valuation of $70, while in 1911, 301 
prizes were given, valued at $827. There were 1,529 pieces of work 
exhibited, all prepared by school children. They were divided 
among the various departments as follows: Literary, 340; agricul- 
tural, 114; floral, 105; domestic science, 587; domestic art, 226; 
manual training, 226; poultry, 45. In addition to these exhibits 
there were 150 entries in the spelling matches and 111 in athletic 
events. Four thousand persons attended. The next year was even 
a greater success. Prizes to the value of $1,200 were awarded, nearly 
5,000 people attended, and 1,500 school children marched in the school 
parade. : : 
Beginning with the Campbell County fair in 1908, the movement 
has spread throughout the State. In 1910 there were several suc-
-P-A-G-E-247
  RURAL EDUCATION. 193 
cessful fairs. In 1911, 20 were held, in 1912, 44, and in 1913, approxi- 
mately 50. A few of these were in connection with the county 
agricultural fairs, but most of them were held independently. They 
are held usually at the county seat and last one day only. People 
from all over the county, including the school children with their 
teachers, assemble by 9 or 10 o’clock in the morning. The first fae 
of the day is spent in the hall examining the exhibits of the work of 
the school children. The exhibits include bread, biscuits, cakes, pies, 
butter, jellies, canned fruits, etc., all prepared by school girls; also 
shirt waists, aprons, handkerchiefs, and other articles as evidence of 
the value of the sewing taught in the schools. Another section con- 
tains exhibits of flowers, a third section the products of the agri- 
cultural clubs, and a fourth section, the manual-training exhibit, 
containing bookeases, writing tables, brooms, farm rakes, ax handles, 
shuck doormats, etc. 
‘As a literary exhibit a large number of compositions are displayed 
on such subjects as good roads, the value of scientific methods of 
farming, how to make a country home comfortable and attractive, 
and the cause and prevention of consumption. In addition there 
are many specimens of writing and drawing, and of maps made by 
school children of their local communities, their county, and the 
State. Nothing is exhibited except the work of children. 
Following the inspection of the exhibit are a few short addresses 
on topics of special interest, usually on some phase of education. 
Following this is an old-fashioned spelling match, in which pupils 
from every school compete. After lunch there comes the annual 
school-fair parade, in which the school children march, grouped by 
individual schools and school districts. Each school is led by its 
teachers; the pupils wear the school colors; many carry pennants, and 
in each group is a large banner bearing the name of theschool. The 
parade is headed by a brass band and is reviewed by the county school 
board and other county officials. Following the parade are the 
athletic contests, in which children from the various schools take part. 
These include events for both boys and girls. 
The county school fair has proved a valuable institution as a social- 
izing agent and as a means of increasing educational sentiment 
throughout the county. It brings together large numbers of children 
from different schools, and their parents. They mingle together in a 
social way, becoming acquainted better than before. Through the 
exhibits and the general atmosphere of the meeting their interest in 
educational work is increased, and any movement for better schools 
meets with a heartier response as a result. 
The State of Oregon has been particularly active during the past 
two years in the encouragement of school fairs. The 1911 legislature 
17726°—xp 19183—vor 1——18
-P-A-G-E-248
  194 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
authorized the State superintendent of public instruction to employ 
two assistants to supervise industrial work in the schools. These 
supervisors are affiliated with the State agricultural college and devote 
most of their time to agricultural activities. The fair movement is 
regarded in the State as important in the development of the public 
schools, as it tends to bring about a more practical education. It isa 
direct result of the introduction of agriculture and animal husbandry 
into the public schools. The fairs are known officially as “school 
children’s industrial fairs.” They are held either as independent 
institutions or in connection with agricultural fairs. In some coun- 
ties local school fairs are held by six or eight adjacent school districts 
combining together for this purpose. The best materials from the 
local fairs are taken to the county agricultural fair and exhibited 
there. The best of the school exhibits at the county fairs are selected 
and exhibited at the State agricultural fair. Prizes are awarded in 
the local, county, and State fairs, amounting during the past year to 
approximately $20,000. The total number of children exhibiting 
was about 75,000, or nearly one-half of the school children of the 
State. The materials exhibited include garden products, flowers, 
work in cooking, preserving, sewing, manual training, poultry and 
hogs raised by pupils. 
These two instances are sufficitnt to show the character of the work 
of the school fair. Reports received from the majority of States show 
that fairs, either local or county, have been held. The older States 
in the East have for many years devoted a part of the exhibit at the 
regular county agricultural fairs to an exhibition of work of the pub- 
lic schools and in many instances have designated one day of the fair 
as educational day. 
COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. 
It is becoming more generally recognized that school conditions 
depend upon both general economic and general social conditions. 
Communities that are poor financially or those of low moral stand- 
ing may maintain good schools, but as a rule they do not. Rural- 
school improvement is a part of general rural-life improvement and 
comes or fails to come with a rural forward movement along all lines. 
This forward movement is coming most rapidly where country com- 
munities are organized for the betterment of themselves and the 
conditions under which they are living. It would seem that such 
organization is imperative. The individualistic life of the farmer of 
two generations ago no longer exists. The self-sufficing farm of 
former days remains only in very remote and sparsely settled regions. 
The farm of to-day is a commercial institution on which the energies 
of the farmer are given to one or two special products. These are
-P-A-G-E-249
  RURAL EDUCATION. 195 
sold, not consumed by the family, and the money obtained is used 
to satisfy the family’s needs. 
The farmer has become a part of the community, and his individual 
progress depends upon the community progress. Formerly he was 
not a part of any community; later a part in educational and religious 
affairs only; now he is a part of a community in commercial affairs as 
well, and his progress in commercial affairs demands that he unite 
his interests with those of other people in the community, both farm- 
ers and tradesmen. i 
It is not enough that the rural population realize that they are a 
part of a community. They must appreciate that if progress in 
economic, social, and educational affairs is to take place, the communi- 
ties must organize. Progress follows continued stimulation, and in- 
terest will be continued only when it is the business of some one or of 
some group to keep up the interest. A few illustrations will be given 
in the following pages of rural organizations, some of which have for 
their primary purpose the general community interests; others 
school improvement alone. As a rule, it is found that the associa- 
tions, whether organized for community betterment or for school 
improvement, must concern themselves with the entire community. 
The school is a part of the community and as such must receive the 
consideration of the general improvement associations, and school- 
improvement associations can do little for the school without indi- 
rectly doing much for the community. 
THE BENNINGTON COUNTY (VT.) IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION, 
This association will serve as an example of a general improvement 
association organized with the county as the unit. It was organized 
in March, 1912, by over 100 prominent business men of the county, 
including men engaged in manufacturing, trading, and farming. It 
concerns itself with anything that is for the betterment of the county. 
It was formed to stimulate activities for economic, educational, social, 
and moral improvement, and to furnish leaders for such betterment 
work. It provides the machinery for putting into operation policies 
generally regarded as desirable which individuals or individual com- 
munities could not put into operation. The county was selected as a 
unit because of the inter-community aspect of the improvement 
work. The association is committed to the following principal lines 
of activities: 
(1) Better and more profitable agriculture. 
(2) Better roads, with a more efficient system of road administration. 
(3) A more adequate system of public schools, which will lead the small isolated 
rural school to a higher plane of efficiency. 
(4) The development of home industries. 
(5) The improvement of sanitary. and hygienic conditions. 
(6) The promotion of adequate play and recreation facilities.  
-P-A-G-E-250
    
196. EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
(7) The fostering of a more evenly distributed social life. 
(8) The furtherance of all plans for civic betterment and county beautification. 
An idea of the activities of the association may be obtained from 
a statement of the definite accomplishments in the first year and a 
half of its existence. 
Agriculture.—A county farm agent was obtained through the 
cooperation of the United States Department of Agriculture and the 
Soil Fertility League of Chicago. This agent is furnished an automo- 
bile by the association. He has visited approximately 200 farms in 
the county, some of them several times. He has addressed 30 farm- 
ers’ meetings and has secured the cooperation of 60 farmers in under- 
taking several forms of demonstration work. They are cultivating 
various crops under his direction. With the cooperation of the State 
college of agriculture, he is taking a farm financial-record survey for 
the purpose of obtaining data to determine what forms of farming 
pay best in that county. 
Through his activities, the Bennington Farmers’ League has been or- 
ganized, and by the end of the.year it is expected that a local associa- 
tion will be formed in every township. The purpose of the league and 
the local branches is to enable the farmer to buy and sell cooper- 
atively. During the year over 100 farmers bought their fertilizers 
through the county league. 
With the cooperation of the school superintendents and teachers, 
a beginning has been made in establishing boys’ agricultural clubs in 
connection with the schools. Much work has also been done in seed 
testing in the schools, under directions furnished by the county farm 
agent. 
Public roads.—A selectmen’s and roadmasters’ association was 
formed as one of the first activities of the county improvement asso- 
ciation. An expert from the Federal Office of Good Roads was 
obtained, who spent in the county the summer and fall of 1912 and 
the entire season when road construction was possible in 1913. This 
agent assumed advisory charge of the construction and maintenance 
of certain selected roads in the several townships of the county, on 
which the work was paid for by the towns and the State. He had 
21 split-log road drags built and demonstrated the effectiveness and 
economy of their use. His work is creating a desire for better roads 
and is demonstrating how good roads may be built and old roads made 
good and maintained at the lowest cost. 
Schools—The association was instrumental in forming two new 
school-supervisory unions, including three townships each, and in 
the establishment of a teacher-training course in an academy in the 
county. As aresult of the services of the new union superintendents, 
better methods of teaching were adopted, teachers’ meetings were 
held at which instruction was given in subjects pertaining to rural
-P-A-G-E-251
  
RURAL EDUCATION. 197 
teaching, courses of study were prepared and furnished to the teacher, 
and school children were reclassified to eliminate unnecessary classes. 
New equipment was obtained, buildings were repaired and painted 
both inside and outside, and school grounds were improved. In 
these two union districts, six schools were abandoned during the year, 
and the children were transported to other buildings. Three more 
will be closed in the present year. In one union graduation exer- 
cises were held for pupils who had completed the eighth grade. 
The teacher-training course established was in the Burr and Burton 
Seminary and in its first year had 12 pupils, of whom 5 were in the 
senior class of the seminary and 7 had previously graduated. The 
seminary course is at least equivalent to that of the standard high 
school. The teacher-training course aims to fit the pupils for rural 
school work. It includes not only methods of teaching subjects 
usually included in the elementary school curriculum, but also some- 
thing about the problems of rural life. Country schools in the 
county were used for observation and practice teaching. 
District nursing.—A graduate nurse, employed by the county-im- 
provement association, made a house-to-house survey of part of the 
county, covering economic, social, moral, religious, sanitary, and 
hygienic conditions. This gave valuable information regarding the 
needs of the county, particularly in relation to sanitation, the facili- 
ties for caring for the sick, the things necessary for the prevention of 
disease, and the sort of instruction in sanitation and hygiene needed 
in the public schools. The nurse took care of several cases of critical 
illness and did considerable social service work in improving con- 
ditions in many homes, in having certain children properly clothed 
and fed, and in other similar ways. A tuberculosis and educational 
motion-picture exhibit prepared by the State department of health 
was secured for the county by the district nurse, and 13 entertain- 
ments were given, which were attended by 2,500 people. 
Affiliated organizations.—Local community-improvement associa- 
tions were organized in every village, wherever possible. They have’ 
been very active in securing physical improvements, such as cement 
-and stone sidewalks, electric lighting, village parks, playgrounds, 
clean streets, new school buildings, ete. Through these local asso- 
ciations, intervillage cooperation was made possible by the county 
improvement association in arranging for a county lyceum lecture 
and entertainment course. Advantageous rates were obtained and 
five numbers of high order were given at several different places in 
the county at a low rate for each course. 
The Bennington County Improvement Association is financed by 
annual dues from its members, and by contributions from certain 
members who constitute the “roll of honor,” and by others called 
“sustaining members.” Nearly 600 regular members pay a fee of    
-P-A-G-E-252
  198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
$1 per year each. Ten sustaining members each contributed $100; 
one on the roll of honor gave $250, the nine others $1,000 each. In 
addition to the activities instituted and supported by the organiza- 
tion, the association employs a secretary to devote his entire time 
to the general management of the association’s affairs and to direct 
a complete survey of economic, social, educational, and religious 
conditions of the county. A man has been employed who has had 
long experience in this sort of work. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY (MD.) COUNTRY LIFE COMMISSION. 
An organization formed in Montgomery County, Md., in 1911, 
under the title of the ‘Montgomery County Country Life Commis- 
sion,” is in many ways similar to the Bennington County association. 
Its aim was to make Montgomery County ‘‘the model rural county 
of the United States,” and it is concerned with anything that relates 
to the welfare of the county, particularly the educational, social, 
moral, and economic factors. 
The principal work done by the commission has been a sociological 
survey of the county, through which facts are now available for a 
basis of the constructive work proposed by the association. The 
commission invited and secured the services of the department of 
ehurch and country life of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions 
in making the survey. This board had made similar surveys in other 
States and had trained investigators in its employ. The field work 
was done by two of them who spent four months in the county. 
They concerned themselves with general economic conditions, the 
character of the population, social welfare, recreation, social life, and 
educational and religious conditions and activities. In the educa- 
tional survey, the investigators were assisted by the United States 
Bureau of Education. As complete information as possible was 
obtained concerning the physical conditions of the school grounds, 
buildings, equipment, etc.; the school enrollment, attendance, rea- 
‘sons for leaving school; the cost of the schools, their instructional 
work, the general educational training and experience of teachers; 
and the social work of the schools. The opinions of about 1,200 
school patrons were obtained regarding the individual schools and 
the school system. The private schools of the county were included 
in the investigation. 
The results of the general survey were published by the Presby- 
terian Board of Home Missions and copies are distributed free, upon 
request addressed to the New York City office of the board. The 
results of the educational survey have been published by the Bureau 
of Education and may be obtained upon application.’

THE MARYLAND COUNTRY LIFE COMMISSION. 
The existence of the Maryland county commission just mentioned 
is responsible in part at least for the introduction in the State legis- 
lature of a bill instructing the governor to appoint a State country 
life commission. This measure was passed by the general assembly 
in April, 1912, and the following persons were named by the gover- 
nor as members of the commission: Henry J. Bowdoin, Robert 
Crain, Jerome A. Davis, E. E. Osborn, Edward Reindollar, W. Irv- 
ing Walker. 
No appropriation was made by the legislature, but the commission 
secured a small fund from private contributions and secured the 
services of an investigator who made a personal, but hasty, survey 
of the conditions surrounding rural life in Maryland. A report has 
been issued containing the results of this survey. It deals with such 
questions as “The rural population,” “The agricultural wealth,” 
“Rural education,” including the State College of Agriculture, the 
State board of agriculture, labor on the farm, the grange, and the 
country church. It contains many recommendations of value. 
PRESCOTT (WIS.) PEOPLE’S CLUB. 
As an example of an improvement organization of a more local 
character than those already mentioned, the Prescott People’s Club 
may be cited. Prescott is a town of less than 1,000 population, 
and is the trading center for a community of farmers. The People’s 
Club is composed of men, women, and children from all occupations 
and professions. Its purpose is the betterment of the people of the 
town and the surrounding territory. It aims to create and maintain 
a friendly spirit between the village people and the neighboring 
farmers, to make the village attractive and the village and farm 
homes as beautiful as possible. 
Its work is carried on through committees, each of which includes 
people from the village and from the farms. For instance, a social 
committee has charge of amusements and entertainments for old 
and young people. A legislative committee keeps in touch with 
the State legislation affecting the community or of particular interest 
to its people. <A publicity committee has done much to advertise 
the town as a place of business and of residence and to advertise 
the surrounding country as desirable for farming. An improvement 
committee is in charge of the work of beautifying the unsightly places 
about the village by turning them into parks and gardens. Vacant 
lots have’been cleaned up, billboards removed, filth and rubbish 
of all kinds disposed of, and trees, shrubs, and flowers have been 
planted. 
The schoolhouse is the meeting place for the organization and also 
for entertainments furnished by the social committee, except when
-P-A-G-E-254
  200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
the attendance requires the use of a larger hall. Bringing the people 
together in the schoolhouse in this way is resulting in an increased 
interest in school affairs and also in many improvements to the school- 
house and school grounds. The village park has been converted 
into a public playground for the benefit of the school children; 
apparatus for play has been provided, and a trained instructor is 
employed. 
The result of all of this work has been the development of a good 
community spirit among the townspeople and of cordial relations 
between them and the farmers surrounding the town. The feeling of 
antagonism and distrust so often found between villagers and farmers 
is wholly absent. The village: people of Prescott and the farm 
people know that in these days of modern farming they are dependent 
upon each other. The association is bringing them together in social, 
religious, and educational affairs, greatly to tHe benefit of both. 
AMENIA (N. Y.) FIELD DAY. 
The village of Amenia, in Dutchess County, N. Y., has had, for the 
past four years, a ‘‘field-day organization,” for the purpose of getting 
all of the people together for a common frolic—a playday in which 
everybody takes part and no one merely stands and looks on. It was 
started as an experiment in cooperative recreation, and is in part a 
substitute for the commercial fair. It is operated by the united 
efforts of the entire community, and people of the whole countryside 
are invited to join with the inhabitants of the village in a day of 
wholesome enjoyment, without the presence of fakers, liquors, side 
shows, and similar amusements found so often in places of community 
gatherings. 
The fundamental ideas underlying the movement in the minds of 
the leaders are: (1) That the country will have to be made more 
attractive socially in order to keep the young folk on the farm; 
(2) that the farm boys and girls should not have so much regular 
work that they will forget how to play; (8) that boys and girls and 
men and women should not only be interested in honest and healthy 
sports, but they should take an active part in them; (4) that people 
who are interested and actively engaged in athletic sports are relieved 
of much of the temptation for strong drink and evil associations; 
and (5) that community progress will be forwarded by getting the 
people together for recreations in which all may take part. 
The usual program contains athletic events for everyone in the 
morning and afternoon, with a short period in the afternoon for 
speechmaking. The evening is usually given over to a band concert. 
The idea has become more popular with each succeeding year. 
A large number of people attend from the surrounding country as 
well as from the village. A community spirit has developed which
-P-A-G-E-255
RURAL EDUCATION. 201 
has brought about many improvements along all lines of local 
progress. STATE AND COUNTY SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS, 
Organizations for the improvement of schools, particularly rural 
schools, exist in many States under the name of school improvement 
associations or leagues. They are sometimes county and sometimes 
local organizations. In the Southern States, especially, many of them 
have been formed. In Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, 
Arkansas, and Virginia, there are State organizers of school improve- 
ment associations employed in the State departments of education. 
In general, their work is that of assisting in organizing county associa- 
tions and school district associations; furnishing suggestions and 
instructions for the association, both county and local, concerning 
the possibilities of their work; outlining suggestive programs for 
school improvement association meetings; and conducting through 
published bulletins, the newspapers of the State, and in any other 
way a publicity campaign for improved rural schools. That it is 
clearly regarded that school improvement must go hand in hand with 
general community improvement is evident from the work the asso- 
ciations are doing. The associations make the schoolhouse the gath- 
ering point for their general meetings, at which there are discussions 
of all phases of rural life. The Mississippi improvement associations 
in all parts of the State observe several special days, at which programs 
in keeping with the day are presented. In November a “public health 
day” is observed, and reports are made on the sanitary conditions of 
the community, and ways and means are discussed of freeing the 
neighborhood of disease. In December “library day” is observed. 
The desirability of rural libraries is discussed, and steps are taken to 
secure libraries for the school and community. In January “arbor 
day” is observed by planting trees on the school grounds and in the 
village parks, on the road sides, and about the homes. ‘This is followed 
by a special meeting where reports are made relative to the plantings. 
In February “club day’ is observed, at which the concerns of the boys’ 
and girls’ agricultural clubs are discussed by parents whose children 
have been enrolled in the clubs. In March a “field day” is held for 
the children of the school and the community, and all sorts of athletic 
sports are indulged.° 
The name of the organizations does not indicate the whole work. 
They exist for the purpose of helping to maintain an efficient school 
in a suitable building, but they also aim to make the school a social 
and civic center, and through this a means of helping the entire 
community. That they are community-improvement associations 
rather than school improvement associations alone is indicated in the 
name adopted in the State of Virginia. There they are called “school 
and civic leagues”; and the State department of education, in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
   
   202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
pamphlet of instructions to local organizers of leagues, says: “Let the 
schoolhouse be the rallying point and the school league the 
institution.” 
The Virginia school league is distinctively a social organization 
holding regular meetings in the school buildings for the discussion of 
special topics concerning community improvements, such as, “How 
farm women can secure some leisure for reading and recreation;” 
“Machinery and conveniences in the home, barn, and on the farm;” 
“The health of the home;” ‘Cooperation between school and home;” 
“Good roads;” and “Compulsory education.” In addition, the 
league does general work for the benefit of the schools and assists in 
keeping the school building and grounds in condition, in securing 
supplies, apparatus, and equipment, and in raising money, in some 
instances, for increasing the salary of the teachers. However, popu- 
larizing education and the school through civic meetings in the 
schoolhouse is at least as important as any other result which is 
achieved. 
One definite result of the school leagues in Virginia, apart from the 
creation of sentiment favoring education, is shown in the work in 
behalf of negro schools. Twenty-five counties of Virginia have 
industrial supervisors of negro schools. These supervisors, in addi- 
tion to introducing industrial subjects into the curriculum, have 
organized, wherever possible, school improvement associations. The 
supervisors, with the assistance of the associations, have during the 
past year raised money to extend the term an average of one month 
each in 198 schools. New buildings (19) were erected at a cost of 
$24,000; 15 buildings were enlarged at a cost of $23,000; 46 were 
painted; 81 whitewashed; and 102 sanitary outhouses were built. 
There are approximately 425 school improvement leagues. 
Alabama now has school improvement associations in every county. 
An indication of their activities for school betterment is the amount of 
money raised through them to supplement the regular school funds 
and expended for physical improvements. During the past year this 
amounted to approximately $100,000. The previous year they 
raised about $60,000. 
Arkansas has nearly 400 active organizations, with approximately 
20,000 members enrolled. In 1912, with only-three-fourths of the 
number of associations, more than $40,000 was raised. 
Reports from other States indicate that similar results are being 
obtained. 
RURAL EDUCATION SURVEYS AND INVESTIGATIONS. 
The work of the several county and State organizations for commu- 
nity and school improvement has been greatly handicapped by the 
lack of definite information concerning the conditions which they are     
 
-P-A-G-E-257
RURAL EDUCATION, 203 
trying to remedy. In almost every instance where an effective 
organization has been formed, the need has been felt of a thorough 
study of the territory served by the organization. The Montgomery 
County (Md.) organization began by having made a thorough socio- 
logical survey of the county. The Bennington (Vt.) association did 
not do this at the beginning, but after an existence of a year and a 
half it is found that such a survey is necessary before thoroughly 
efficient work can be done. It is becoming generally recognized that 
the most effective work in school improvement must be based upon a 
complete knowledge of the exact status of the school, with definite 
data concerning the economic, social, and moral status of the commu- 
nity at large. This is the sort of information that rural education 
surveys and investigations bring out. : 
The Maryland educational survey, as mentioned in another para- 
graph, was made by field investigators of the country life department 
of the Presbyterian board of home missions, with the assistance of 
the Bureau of Education. This same organization has made similar 
county surveys in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, 
Kentucky, and Tennessee. Its survey work was begun to determine 
the status of the Presbyterian Church in the rural portions of the 
States studied. It was found necessary, however, to study the 
status of other churches at the same time, in order to compare the 
work of the Presbyterian Church with that of other denominations; 
and it was found necessary to study, as well, economic, educational, 
and social conditions, as all of these conditions affect the church, 
both directly and indirectly. Therefore the earlier surveys by the 
Presbyterian board of home missions were confined largely to church 
conditions, but their more recent surveys are general in scope and 
concern themselves with all phases of the lives of the people. The 
work has been done in each case by investigators who have spent 
considerable time in the territory studied and obtained data and 
information from all authentic sources possible. 
Another notable series of county surveys has been made by the 
students in the State Normal School of Athens, Ga., under the direc- 
tion of Mr. E. C. Branson, professor of rural sociology, through an 
organization known as the Georgia Club. The survey work is done 
as a practical feature of the course in rural sociology. The students 
are studying Georgia, as a whole, and county by county. They com- 
pare Georgia with other States and with herself a decade ago. Each 
county is studied in comparison with other counties and with itself 
at the last census. The inquiry is concerned with the people, agri- 
culture, manufactures, wealth and taxation, public roads, cooperative 
enterprises, sanitation, the schools, and the church. Information 
is taken from census reports and from official State, county, and 
church records.

The results of the surveys are published and used in each county in 
county-improvement work by local affiliated members of the Georgia 
Club, composed of business and professional men occapying promi- 
nent places in their counties. The primary purpose of the survey, 
however, is for its educational value for the prospective rural-school 
teacher. It is coming to be generally believed that the teacher, in 
order to teach successfully, must know the conditions under which — 
the pupils are living; and, in order to make the school serve in the 
fullest measure the community for which it exists, the teacher must 
know the economic and social conditions of that community. The 
survey, as made in the normal school, shows the young teacher how 
to get information relative to these conditions. The study of the 
facts brought out in the survey in the school inspires students with 
the desire to become as nearly as possible ideal teachers and en- 
courages them to serve their communities outside of the school with 
intelligence based on a scientific study of the surrounding conditions.! 
Several other institutions in the country are undertaking similar 
work. Since the work at Athens has become known, and particularly 
since the publication by the bureau of a bulletin outlining the organi- 
zation of the Georgia Club, several colleges and normal schools are 
trying the plan. 
Educational surveys similar to those made in Maryland and Georgia 
have been made and are making in many States throughout the 
Union. Progressive county superintendents are “ taking inventory” 
by conducting surveys in their respective counties. Educational 
institutions are increasing the scope of their activities by studying 
the territory surrounding them. This is true particularly of State 
normal schools and of State colleges of agriculture. The agricultural 
colleges, of course, concern themselves especially with the agriculture 
of the territories studied, but they have also investigated educational 
facilities. The most notable of the agricultural college surveys was 
that made of several townships in Tompkins County by Dr. G. F. 
Warren, of New York State College of Agriculture. This was an agri- 
cultural survey, but much valuable information was obtained concern- 
ing the education of farmers, and particularly concerning the value 
of education in increasing their earning capacity as farmers. The 
Massachusetts Agricultural College, through its department of social 
science, is making similar studies. 
THE WISCONSIN SURVEY. 
Several studies have been made recently of the rural schools of 
entire States by certain State commissions with a view to obtaining 
information for use in revising school laws so that a more rapid 
improvement of the rural schools might follow. The ‘‘North Da-

kota Rural School Commission,” the ‘‘Better Iowa Schools Com- 
mission,” and the ‘‘Wisconsin Committee of Fifteen”.may be cited 
as examples of such commissions. The studies made by these three, 
and by the majority of similar committees, were general in character. 
None of these commissions made a detailed inquiry into the manage- 
ment of individual schools, nor of their instructional work. During 
the past year, however, an investigation was made in Wisconsin 
under the auspices of the Wisconsin State board of public affairs, 
which did go into the details of management and of the instruction 
given in the rural schools. The board secured the cooperation of 
the Training School for Public Service, an institution affiliated with 
the New York Bureau of Municipal Research. The study was con- 
ducted for the purpose of obtaining facts and information for con- 
structive legislation for the improvement of the rural schools. The 
investigation was made with the cooperation of the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction and of the county superintendents. It 
was concerned with the following points: 
(1) The business management of the schools. 
(2) The sanitary and physical conditions. 
(3) The qualifications of the teachers. 
(4) The character and the conduct of the instruction. 
(5) The quantity and quality of county and State supervision. 
A general examination was made of school conditions in 27 widely 
distributed counties and a detailed investigation of 131 schools in 
13 counties. A report was issued giving the findings of the study. - 
It includes recommendations suggested to remedy some of the con- 
ditions which were found to be unsatisfactory. The report of the 
investigation has created much interest, not only in Wisconsin, but 
in other States, because of the findings of the investigators. School 
authorities and others realize that the unsatisfactory conditions 
brought to light in Wisconsin are not confined to that State alone, 
but probably prevail in other States where the organization for 
rural school management and supervision is similar to that existing 
in Wisconsin at the time of the investigation. That is the ‘‘single 
district” organization, in which practically each separate school has 
a local board of trustees in full control of the school and its affairs. 
More than one-half of the States in the United States are organized 
on this basis. 
The field study in Wisconsin shows, in general: 
(1) That the business management of the rural school is uneconomical and often 
unintelligent. 
(2) That the financial accounts of the schools are very often not accurate, and in 
several instances show irregularities which suggest dishonesty on the part of school 
treasurers or boards of trustees. 
(83) That school buildings, grounds, and equipment are unsuited to school purposes, 
unattractive, and often unsanitary. 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
(4) That school trustees have no ‘‘standard” by which to judge the prospective 
teacher whom they are about to engage. 
(5) That few professionally trained teachers are employed in rural schools, and 
methods of teaching are crude. 
(6) That there is practically no supervision on the part of the county superintend- 
ents. 
The findings were a surprise to the great majority of the people 
in the State—even to those who considered themselves somewhat 
familiar with rural education. It resulted in the introduction of 
many bills in the legislature to remedy the unsatisfactory conditions 
found. 
The most important measure passed by the legislature is one 
providing for a county board of education in every county in the 
State. This board is to be a continuing board of five members, 
one elected each year for a term of five years. The county superin- 
tendent is elected, as formerly, by the people, but his salary is fixed 
by the county board. The county board is empowered to appoint 
one assistant superintendent from a list of three persons submitted 
by the county superintendent, in all cases where there are more 
than 100 schools in the county, not including those in the city school 
districts. The county board may also appoint a clerk to assist the 
superintendent in his office work. Further powers given to the 
board include the authority to organize, alter, or consolidate school 
districts, to appoint a board to examine pupils for common-school 
diplomas, and to require of the county superintendent such reports 
as it may desire. It also is given the full management of the county 
training schools for rural teachers. 
THE OHIO INVESTIGATION. 
An investigation was made in Ohio, in the summer and fall of 1912, 
which was similar to the Wisconsin investigation. It was called the 
Ohio Rural Life Survey, and was conducted by an organization com- 
posed of representatives of 40 Ohio educational institutions. The 
field work was done under the direction of the department of church 
and country life of the Presbyterian board of home missions. The 
survey covered 21 counties. Over 60 men were engaged in the inves- 
tigation. The inquiry was concerned with all phases of rural life, 
particularly economic, social, recreational, religious, and educational. 
The results were given wide publicity through the press and country 
life institutes. An appreciation of the condition of affairs in the 
rural schools was created in the State among the leaders in public 
affairs, and the result was the introduction into the legislature of 
several measures proposing to remedy conditions. As a substitute, 
however, for the proposed measures, the legislature provided, upon 
the recommendation of the governor, a special commission to make
-P-A-G-E-261
RURAL EDUCATION. 207 
a more detailed study than had already been made by the Ohio Rural 
Life Survey.* 
Common schools, normal schools, and agricultural schools are in- 
cluded in its scope. 
In accordance with the provisions of the act of the legislature, the 
governor selected a commission of three members, Miss Edith Camp- 
bell, William L. Allendorf, and O. J. Thatcher. These persons 
served without pay, but were provided with a State appropriation 
of $10,000 to employ a secretary and investigator, and to pay in part 
the expenses of the survey. To this amount was added a much 
larger sum provided by the Training School for Public Service of the 
New York Bureau of Municipal Research. Also Mr. Horace L. 
Brittain of the training school was secured as secretary of the com- 
mission and director of the survey. 
The inadequacy of the appropriation made it necessary to use vol- 
unteer workers in the field. These included 1 dean of a college, 2 
deans of normal schools, 18 professors in normal schools and colleges 
of education (including 5 critic teachers), 59 senior students of edu- 
cation, all but 1 of whom had had experience in rural-school teaching 
varying from 1 to 18 years, and 3 members of the legislature, 1 of 
whom was a member of the survey commission. The field workers 
spent an aggregate of 340 days in the field and inspected 340 one- 
room rural schools. Each worker spent at least one day in each 
school inspected, no matter how small; in most cases at least eight 
hours were spent in the school, in interviewing teachers and school 
patrons, in making the tests and filling out reports. 
In addition to field work of this nature, a study of the business 
procedure of boards of education was made, and an investigation was 
made of the management of school lands. Other material was ob- 
tained by a study of records already in existence, by a questionnaire 
sent. to 25,000 teachers, by 2 questionnaires each to 88 county audi- 
tors, and by three questionnaires each to 419 superintendents of 
schools. : 
As the work of the survey neared completion the governor of the 
State issued a proclamation suggesting that Friday, November 14, 
be observed as School Survey Day and that a meeting be held in every 
schoolhouse in the State on the afternoon or evening of that day. 
More than 6,000 such meetings were held. A pamphlet issued by 
the State department of public instruction sent to each school con- 
tained a suggestive program for the evening. It contained also the 
governor’s proclamation, a brief history of education in Ohio, and a 
statement relating to the survey. These three subjects were dis- 
cussed at the meetings, and delegates were appointed to a State 
educational congress called by the governor and held at Columbus 
  
1 Act approved Mar. 11, 1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
on December 5 and 6. At this meeting a preliminary report-of the 
commission was given, and tentative suggestions were made for the 
improvement of the unsatisfactory conditions brought to light by 
the survey. A digest of these suggestions, prepared by the State 
superintendent of public instruction, is presented below: 
Digest of the Constructive Suggestions of the Ohio State School Survey Commission. 
The constructive suggestions with regard to the supervision of rural and village 
schools will call for compulsory supervision along the same general lines as have been 
in existence for many years, in cities with only such modifications as are made 
necessary by rural conditions. As in the case of cities, the rural communities will 
have absolute charge of the supervision of their own schools and the home-rule prin- 
ciple for the rural and village districts has been maintained entirely intact. 
The following are the chief features of the plan: 
1. A county board of education elected at large on a nonpartisan ballot by all voters 
of the county outside of cities, which already have full time supervision. This will 
not disturb the local boards of education in any sense, but will leave them in full 
control of their own schools. 
2..A county superintendent of schools elected by the county board of education 
entirely without outside dictation. This county superintendent shall be a professional 
man and may be selected from any part of the State. The State shall pay half the 
salary of the county superintendent up to a maximum payment by the State of $1,000. 
3. Division of the county into supervision districts by the county board of education, 
these supervision districts to be made up of rural and village school districts according 
to the number of teachers employed. The minimum number of teachers per district 
superintendent shall be 20 and the maximum 80. In case any township or village 
district or union of school districts for supervision purposes is already employing a 
superintendent who gives his full time to the work, even if the number of teachers 
employed fall below 20, the county board of education, on application from such 
district or union of districts, shall erect the district or union of districts into a super- 
vision district on the following conditions: (a) That the superintendent continue to 
give his full time to supervision; (b) that instead of receiving full county aid the 
supervision district constituted as above shall receive a pro rata amount determined 
by the ratio of the number of teachers actually employed to 40—a proposed average 
number of teachers per superintendent as a basis. 
4. The election of the district superintendent—(a) By the board of education in 
case there be but one school district in the supervision district; (6) by a joint meeting 
of the boards of education in districts where there are either two or three school dis- 
tricts in the supervision district; (¢) by the presidents of the various boards of educa- 
tion in all supervision districts which contain more than three school districts. 
5. The nomination, but not appointment, of the district superintendent by the 
county superintendent, the boards or presidents of boards, as the case may be, having 
the power to elect over this nomination on a three-fourths vote as in the city. 
6. That local boards of education remain exactly as at present, with the right to 
elect the teacher on the nomination of the district superintendent and with the right 
to elect over his nomination by a three-fourth vote, as is the case in the cities. 
7. The protection of all efficient supervisors now in the service by a provision in the 
law that three years’ successful experience in supervision places a man automatically 
on the eligible list. 
8. The payment of half the salary of each district superintendent by the county 
up to a maximum payment by the county of $750. 
9. The requirement of professional training of superintendents not now in service 
by a provision which will enable young men to enter the profession if they have had
-P-A-G-E-263
  RURAL EDUCATION. 209 
three years’ successful teaching experience, and if they are willing to take a one-year 
graduate or senior course in the principles of school administration and supervision— 
such course to be taken in some reputable professional school. 
It will be seen at the first glance that this plan of supervision maintains the rights 
of local communities, thus preserving to the schools the wonderful value of local loyalty 
while at the same time providing professional supervision for every school building 
in the State, large or small. This plan of supervision makes entirely impossible the 
least degree of State centralization. 
Training of rural teachers. 
The commission proposes— 
1. That from one to three rural and small village high schools in each county shall 
be subsidized by the State to establish one-year training course for rural teachers 
with the certainty that the only way of properly preparing rural teachers is under 
rural conditions and that the only way of effectively keeping rural teachers is to 
keep them in sympathy with rural conditions throughout their school course. 
2. The establishment of more summer courses for the training of teachers and the 
enlargement of those courses already existing. 
3. The very gradual increase of the professional requirements of teachers so that 
there will be no undersupply of teachers from year to year, until by the year 1920 
every teacher in Ohio who has entered the profession since 1913 will have had the 
equivalent of one year’s professional training. 
4. The revision of the examination system by which the 58 varieties of teachers’ 
certificates now in existence will be reduced to 32 and by which one-half of each 
examination will consist of a practical test in classroom instruction, so that it will no 
longer be possible for a boy or girl of 18 successfully to cram up for examination and 
get a teacher’s certificate no matter how unfit he or she may be for work in a school. 
room; and so that a young man or woman who shows the ability actually to instruct 
can not be deprived of a teacher’s certificate simply because he or she is not a mind 
reader and can not guess what is in the heads of the examiners. 
Continuation of survey work. 
The commission believes that the survey as a survey must close its work by the Ist 
of January, but it also believes that there must be some provision made for the actual 
working out of details and follow-up-work in getting the legislation to be passed in 
January and February into actual operation. In place of a temporary survey it is 
proposed to form an efficiency organization in the State, made up of a director in the 
office of the State superintendent of publi¢ instruction and a department of survey 
in each normal college and normal school in the State so that with hardly any expense 
to the State men already in its service and who have already participated in this 
survey shall continue the work not for one year nor for two years, but as long as prog- 
ress in education is necessary in the State of Ohio. This plan of calling in already 
existing institutions to do the work of survey is not only economical, but it will bring 
these various institutions more closely into touch with their constituencies and will 
give the students at these institutions a clearer practical knowledge of what efficiency 
in school work means. 
Jn fine, this plan provides at a nominal cost for a continuous survey which shall be 
always up to date.! 
1Since this section was placed in type the Ohio State Legislature has met in special session and adopted a new school code. Many of ihe recommendations of the commission were adopted as offered; others were adopted with minor changes.

THE VERMONT SURVEY. 
Previous to the establishment of the Ohio commission, Vermont 
had provided, by an act of the legislature, a commission to investigate 
the educational system of the State. This commission was appointed 
by the governor and is also more than a rural school commission. It 
is instructed te inquire into the work of the colleges of the State, 
and also to recommend such reorganization of the public elementary 
and secondary schools and of the entire educational system of the 
State as “in their judgment will promote the ends of unity, harmony, 
economy, and efficiency.” The commission has secured the coopera- 
tion of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
in making the investigation. 
Three experts were placed in the field by the Foundation and a 
thorough study of the educational system of the State made. The 
recommendations affecting directly rural education are as follows: 
1. The recognition by the State of the reorganization of elementary and secondary 
education, including vocational training, as its immediate and supreme duty. 
2. The organization of the office of a commissioner of education upon a basis 
competent to furnish expert supervision for the public school system. This involves 
asmall lay board serving without salary, and salaries for educational experts of a 
character to secure the ablest men and women. 
3. The problem of revision of the course of study, the establishment of agencies 
for training teachers, and other administrative details to be worked out by this 
board and its experts. 
4, The State Agricultural College to receive a larger proportion of the generous 
annual appropriation of the State from the Federal Government and to be developed 
along lines calculated to make a fruitful connection between the agricultural college 
and. the industries of farming, dairying, gardening, stock and poultry raising, and 
fruit culture. 
The recommendations in detail have been published by the Foun- 
dation in its report on the investigation, entitled ‘(Education in 
Vermont.”

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
During the past year discussions concerning agricultural education 
have been as to what and how to teach in the elementary schools, 
the secondary schools, and the colleges, rather than concerning the 
need of such education. Both educators and laymen are coming to’ 
a more definite understanding of the whole movement. 
The similarity in definition of terms, as adopted recently by the 
Legislatures of Massachusetts, Indiana, and New Jersey, is very 
marked. There is.yet wide difference in opinions as to the organiza- 
tions, methods, and terminology, but the tendency is strongly toward 
uniformity. 
In general usage the term “agriculture” includes all forms of 
farming, horticulture, forestry, and animal husbandry. As applied 
to the public schools, it indicates a study of the elementary principles 
of the science of agriculture and a training in the art of agriculture. 
In the lower grades it takes the form of school gardening and that 
portion of nature study which deals with plants and with soils, in- 
sects, birds, and weather, in their relation to plant growth and de- 
velopment. The chief aim of agricultural instruction in the primary 
grades is neither scientific nor commercial; it is designed rather to 
interest the child in the general field of agriculture, to develop a love 
for plants and animals, to enable him to see and to appreciate the 
beauties of nature—in other words, to foster a healthy attitude «i

toward country life. In the upper grades and in the high school 
it becomes, to a limited degree, both commercial and scientific, but 
in all cases it must be primarily educational, to remain a permanent 
part of the public-school curriculum. 
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES. 
The increase in the number of students in the agricultural col- 
leges was greater in 1912-13 than ever before, and the increase was 
well distributed throughout the United States. A large part of this 
increase is due to the demand for teachers of agriculture and for 
county demonstration agents. 
Kansas State Agricultural College has established a secondary — 
school of agriculture in connection with the college, which will be 
used as a model school in the teacher’s training courses. 
At the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College a 
department of extension has been established in accordance with 
an act of the legislature of 1913, which appropriated $8,000 for the 
biennium for that purpose. A department of agricultural education 
has also been established, and a course in the teaching of agriculture 
is offered in 1913-14 to senior students of the agricultural college who 
expect to teach. It is planned to establish a 4-year teacher’s train- 
ing course, with secondary practice schools. 
In Indiana a State supervisor of agricultural education has been 
appointed and departments of agriculture are to be established in 
a number of high schools in the State under the direction of the 
supervisor. All this is in accordance with the conditions named in the 
vocational education bill passed by the last legislature, which author- 
ized State aid to all departments and special schools conforming to 
the rules and regulations of the State board of education. 
In New Jersey, by an act of the legislature in 1913— 
the State will give money for the equipment and maintenance of approved 
vocational schools on a dollar-for-dollar basis in proportion to the amount spent 
by the local community out of funds raised by local taxation to the amount of 
$10,000 annually. 
The following rules and regulations, adopted by the State board of 
education, apply to agricultural schools: 
1. Advisory committee must be appointed. 
2. A separate vocational school must be in a separate building and have a 
separate organization of curricula, equipment, pupils, and teachers. 
8. A vocational department of another school must have a separate organi- 
zation of curricula, pupils, and teachers, as far as the vocational work is 
concerned. 
4. The State board of education will not approve for any district State aid 
for more than $10,000 unless the applications from all the districts amount to 
less than $80,000.

5. To receive State aid in any given year, application must be made before 
January 1. 
6. In an all-day vocational school (@) not less than one-half of the time must 
be given to shop or farm work; * * * (c) instruction must tend to become 
individual; * * * (f) the school day must not be less than six nor more 
than seyen hours in length; (g) the agricultural vocational school must have 
-its courses arranged as a series of projects. 
7. The part-time class must give instruction of direct value to the pupil for 
the work in which he is engaged. 
8. To secure approval, the part-time or continuation work must (@) deal 
with a specific group of workers; (0) add to the technical knowledge and me- 
chanical skill of the workers; (¢) provide eflicient instruction; (d) provide 
adequate amount of time. 
9. An evening industrial or agricultural or household arts school must give 
short unit courses. 
10. All vocational schools must provide for (a) shop or farm or household 
experience; (0) instruction in related subjects; (c) instruction in academic 
subjects. 
11. Schools must be convenient of location and access. 
12. Schools must have an adequate general and mechanical equipment. 
13. Tuition may be paid by a district sending pupils to vocational schools and 
be reimbursed to the amount of $25 per annum for each pupil. 
14, Districts may transport pupils either within the district or to other dis- 
tricts and be reimbursed by the State for 75 per cent of the amount expended. 
A limited agricultural vocational certificate may be issued to an applicant to 
teach agriculture in a State-aided vocational school, provided the applicant pre- 
sents evidence (a) that he has had adequate and successful farm experience; 
(b) that he is a graduate of an approved agricultural college; (c¢) that he is 
at least 21 years old; (d) that he has filed testimonials as to moral character 
and a physician’s certificate of heaith. In lieu of (b) the State board of 
examiners will accept evidence of an academic training of at least two years 
beyond the usual four-year high-school course in an approved college or normal 
school or the equivalent thereof and at least four “short courses” in an 
approved agricultural college. 
The limited certificate is valid for one year, at the end of which it may be 
renewed for two years upon the recommendations of both the superintendent of 
schools having jurisdiction and the commissioner of education. A limited agri- 
cultural vocational certificate may be made permanent after three years of 
successful teaching upon the recommendations of both the superintendent of 
schools having jurisdiction and the commissioner of education. An agricultural 
yocational certificate shall entitle the holder to teach agriculture and the allied 
academic subjects in a State-aided vocational school. 
  Certificates are required of all teachers and supervisors of voca- 
tional subjects in State-aided vocational schools. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
According to the most reliable information obtainable, there were 
about 2,300 high schools in the United States teaching agriculture 
in 1912-13. This indicates an increase of about 300 over the previous 
year. This number includes 47 State agricultural schools, 40 district 
agricultural schools, 67 county agricultural schools, 18 agricultural  
-P-A-G-E-268
  214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
departments of high schools, and the remaining 2,128 ordinary schools 
giving courses in agriculture. 
One hundred and three normal schools reported courses in agri- 
culture. Several special agricultural schools authorized by acts of 
legislature have not yet been organized. 
The growth in the number of secondary schools teaching agricul- 
ture, while not as great as in some former years, was undoubtedly a 
more normal growth, and as great as the available supply of teachers 
qualified for the work would warrant. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The greatest activity along the lines of agricultural instruction in 
the elementary schools is that of the boys’ and girls’ club work, which 
had a remarkable growth during the past year. The correlation of 
this work and the agricultural nature study with the regular work of 
the school has added very materially to the value of the curricula. 
Data are not available for a report of the number of elementary 
schools attempting to teach agriculture, but it is safe to say that the 
tendency is toward improvement in the quality of teaching in other 
subjects and toward adapting them to the home life of the child 
rather than the wholesale introduction of agriculture into schools 
taught by teachers ill prepared for the work either by experience, 
training, or temperament. 
Agriculture is more and more coming to be considered a fit subject 
of study for the elementary school, but at the same time the need of 
trained teachers is widely recognized as a serious hindrance. 
TEACHERS’ TRAINING COURSES. 
Forty of the land-grant institutions offered, during the past year, 
special work for the preparation of teachers of agriculture; 15 offer 
courses for teachers covering 4 years; 2 offer 2-year courses; and 3 
give 1-year courses. Thirty-one of these institutions reported sum- 
mer schools, and 20 gave summer courses in agricultural pedagogy. 
Four institutions ‘also offered a course for college graduates who ex- 
pect to teach agriculture. 
A great many institutions besides land-grant colleges offer agri- 
culture in summer courses. Summer schools teaching agriculture in 
1913 were reported to the Bureau of Education as follows: Alabama, 
6; Arkansas, 3; California, 83; Colorado, 1; Connecticut, 1; Delaware, 
2; Florida, 1; Georgia, 1; Idaho, 3; Illinois, 2; Indiana, 4; Iowa, 2; 
Kansas, 1; Kentucky, 2; Louisiana, 3; Maine, 2; Massachusetts, 2;

THE SUMMER GRADUATE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
The fifth session of the graduate school of agriculture was held at 
the Michigan Agricultural College, East Lansing, Mich., July 1-26, 
1918. As heretofore, the school was under the general management 
of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experi- 
ment Stations, through its standing committee on graduate study. 
The financial support of the school was derived from the contribu- 
tions of many of the colleges represented in the association, the 
matriculation fees of the students, and the funds of the Michigan 
Agricultural College. This institution, through its president and 
trustees, generously assumed responsibility for the maintenance of 
the school. 
Courses of study were offered in the following lines: Soils and 
plant physiology, animal physiology, agronomy, horticulture, beef 
and dairy cattle, swine and poultry, rural engineering and rural 
economics, including farm management. As at previous sessions, the 
hours were so arranged that all interested in plants could attend the 
course in soils and plant physiology, and those interested in animals 
could attend the course in animal physiology. Both courses dealt 
more particularly with fundamental topics considered from the stand- 
point of both pure and applied science. The other courses were so 
arranged that the students naturally divided into smaller groups 
along the lines of their special interests. 
The faculty numbered 48, and, in addition, there were 6 speakers 
at special conferences on general questions relating to agricultural 
education and research. : 
The total enrollment of students was 180, including 41 women, 
who were also enrolled in the graduate school of home economics. 
This latter school was under the general management of the American 
Home Economics Association, and for the first time prolonged its 
session to cover four weeks. As heretofore, it was conducted in close 
affiliation with the graduate school of agriculture. The students in 
the schools came from 34 States, and Porto Rico, Canada, Russia, 
China, and Japan. 
Dean True, of the graduate school of agriculture, gave a brief 
summary of the history of the school during the decade of its exist- 
ence, and pointed out in a general way the development of American 
agriculture and agricultural education and research during that 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
  216 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
period. The substance of his remarks on the latter topic were as 
follows: ° 
The main objects of the school have been to arouse interest in graduate 
study and to stimulate a keener sense of the needs and requirements of such 
work by bringing graduate students for a brief time under the direct: influ- 
ence and inspiration of leading teachers and investigators in different branches 
of agricultural and related sciences. There can be no doubt that this school 
has exerted considerable influence in promoting the establishment of graduate 
courses in agriculture in a number of institutions. It is also believed that it 
has done much toward creating more favorable conditions for serious study 
and research along agricultural lines in our whole system of agricultural col- 
Jeges and experiment stations. And through its conferences on pedagogical 
and other questions relating to the broader aspects of agricultural education it 
has aided in the wider diffusion of agricultural knowledge through the lower 
schools and extension agencies. 
In the decade during which the graduate school of agriculture has been in 
eperation the movement for agricultural education in the United States has 
been greatly broadened and strengthened. Comparing very briefly the statistics 
of 1901 with those of 1911 (the latest available), we may get some indication of 
the growth of our agricultural institutions during this period. The per- 
manent funds and equipment of the land-grant colleges have increased from 
$67,000,000 to $120,000,000, and their income from $7,000,000 to $22,000,000. 
The total number of students has increased from 42,000 to 84,000, and of agri- 
cultural students from 7,000 to 16,000. 
In 1901, 2,000 farmers’ institutes were held in the United States, with an 
attendance of 500,000; in 1911 there were 6,000 institutes, with an attendance 
of 2,500,000, to which may be added 1,000,000 persons who attended the lectures 
given in connection with special railroad trains and other forms of extension 
work. 
Meanwhile there has been a remarkably rapid introduction of agriculture 
into the secondary schools. Within the past two years the number of institu- 
tions of secondary grade giving courses in agriculture has risen from 700 to 
2,300. 
Within the past 10 years experimental and research work in agricultural 
lines has also greatly increased. In 1901 the experiment stations had an in- 
come of $1,232,000, as compared with $3,615,000 in 1911, and the membership 
of their staffs increased from 688 to 1,587. In the middle of this period the 
. Adams Act was passed, which has already done very much to set in operation 
higher researches on agricultural problems. 
It is interesting to note the increase in some lines of research—the number of 
chemists increasing from 146 to 293, botanists from 49 to 84, mycologists and 
pacteriologists from 21 to 60, entomologists from 48 to 108, horticulturists from 
78 to 181, animal husbandmen from 14 to 101, and dairymen from 31 to T7. 
Great advance in specialization is also shown in the following, who did not 
appear at all in the 1901 statistics of the stations, but were given in 1911: 
Agronomists, 189; plant breeders, 12; soil specialists, 34; plant pathologists, 54; 
foresters, 22; poultrymen, 32; and agricultural engineers, 21. 
Meanwhile the financial interests involved in American agriculture have 
grown enormously. Land values have more than doubled, and aggregate nearly 
thirty billions of dollars; total values of farm property have also doubled, and 
aggregate over forty billions of dollars. The total value of the agricultural 
products of the United States for the 12 years ending in 1910 was seventy-nine 
billions of dollars.
-P-A-G-E-271
PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13. 217 
The number of our farms has increased only 10.5 per cent, but they aggregate 
6,340,000; the farm population has increased very slowly, but there are 30,- 
000,000 people on our farms. 
We are just awakening to the vast significance of the human and material 
problems involved in the development of our agriculture. Attention is just now 
focused on the rapid spread of the movement for popular education in agricul- 
ture. But those who stand closest to this great movement, and realize most 
fully what it means, know also that there never was a time when wise leader- 
ship and sound and deep knowledge in agricultural matters were so much to be 
desired as to-day. The period of propaganda to convince the rural people 
of the desirability of agricultural education and research is nearly over. What 
is especially needed now is wise and well-educated leadership, in order that 
the great movements under way may be efficiently organized and guided in 
right channels. Thoroughly trained investigators, teachers, and administrators 
are needed in constantly increasing numbers, and the supply is far below the 
demand. 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 
The educational work of the department has been continued along 
the same general lines, but has grown considerably in extent. As 
in former years, the Office of Experiment Stations has represented 
the department in its relations with educational agencies, but several 
of the other bureaus and divisions have continued educational work 
closely related to their respective lines of investigation. 
At the close of the cropping season of 1912, the Office of Farm 
Management of the Bureau of Plant Industry had a total enrollment 
of 22,000 boys and girls in the Northern, Central, and Western States. 
At the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1913, the same office had 
a total enrollment of 60,000, about 25,000 of these being handled 
directly from the Office of Farm Management. The remainder were 
handled through the State leaders and through the extension de- 
partments of the colleges of agriculture. 
The following club activities have been systematically organized 
and promoted during the fiscal year: Boys’ corn clubs on the acre 
basis, girls’ garden and canning clubs based upon one-tenth of an 
acre of tomatoes and the canning of the surplus products, potato 
clubs, vacation canning and marketing clubs, sugar-beet clubs, poul- 
try clubs, vegetable-garden clubs, and good-roads clubs, 
A club of 1,000 members, consisting of 500 boys and their fathers, 
constitute the father-son club in the State of Kentucky for the pres- 
ent cropping season. This is a special effort to demonstrate the 
possibilities of teamwork in the home and upon the farm by enroll- 
ing the father and son in the same club and requiring the father to 
take 10 acres of cqrn in cooperation with the boy and his 1 acre, and 
follow the same instructions. The champion team records (father-son 
combination) of Kentucky are as follows: Edward C. Gallrein, of 
Jefferson County, grew 146 bushels and 36 pounds of Johnson County 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
   
   218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
corn on his acre. The average cost per bushel was 14 cents, and the 
net profit on his acre was $67.32. His father, Herman Gallrein, 
grew the same kind of corn and followed the same corn club instruc- 
tions on 10 acres adjoining the boy’s acre, and made an average yield 
of 139 bushels and 43 pounds per acre, at an average cost of 10 cents 
per bushel, showing a net profit per acre of $69.91. 
Wherever the garden and canning club interests are promoted, an 
effort is made always to interest the mother with the daughter in 
the canning activities. At one course of instruction in Colorado in 
the interest of garden and canning club work, 880 women were 
present, to take the instruction with the girls. 
During the winter months, in connection with the public schools 
of several States, special seed-testing campaigns were inaugurated, 
and some liberal premiums were awarded to the rural schools whose 
pupils would test the largest number of seed-corn ears for the farm- 
ers of the school district. In many school districts all the seed corn 
is tested by the children, and tabulated results of the tests were fur- 
nished to farmers and local papers. It may be said in this connec- 
tion that a seed-corn label is used exclusively in corn-club work for 
marking hand-selected seed, 
In the boys’ corn clubs of the Southern States 91,196 boys each 
planted an acre of corn in 1913. The Office of Farmers’ Cooperative 
Demonstration Work of the Bureau of Plant Industry, with whom 
these boys are enrolled, is now making a systematic campaign 
throughout the whole South to show the corn-club boys the impor- 
tance of legumes and winter cover crops. In this new work the boys 
will learn the fundamental principles of proper crop rotation. 
In the girls’ canning clubs there are 33,060 members distributed 
over 12 Southern States. Each one of these girls had a garden of 
one-tenth of an acre of tomatoes. In her study of plant life she 
specializes the first year on the tomato plant. She learns a good 
deal of botany and horticulture before she actually takes up canning 
work. In most sections of the South the girls grow other vegetables 
in their gardens at the same time the tomatoes are growing. In 
addition they are encouraged to can and preserve all the surplus 
fruits and vegetables about their homes. Thousands of cans of 
peaches, berries, and beans are in pantries in the South where none 
existed a few years ago. A trade-mark, brand, and motto have 
been adopted for general use by the girls’ clubs. 
Three traveling exhibits, consisting of 44 photographs each, were 
used continuously during the year by the Forest Service. They were 
displayed at 48 schools and libraries, an increase of 3 over last year. 
There was a marked increase in the number of duplicate photographs 
furnished as gifts. The lantern-slide collection of the office of edu- 
cational cooperation of the Forest Service now contains 8,812 slides. 
These slides have been used more for teachers’ training schools  
-P-A-G-E-273
   
  PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13, 219 
throughout the country this year than ever before. The special 
sets of slides with lecture outlines accompanying them have been 
in constant use. 
A farmers’ bulletin on “ Forestry in agriculture” was prepared, 
and preparation was begun on a farmers’ bulletin on “ Forestry in 
geography,” in cooperation with the Office of Experiment Stations. 
During the past fiscal year the Bureau of Animal Industry has 
taken up the organization of boys’ pig clubs in an experimental way. 
The work is being done in cooperation with the farmers’ cooperative 
demonstration work of the Bureau of Plant Industry and the State. 
agricultural colleges. The State of Louisiana was the pioneer in this 
‘work, and the bureau is paying part of the salary of the agent in 
barge in that State.. An agent has also been placed in Alabama to 
supervise the organization of the boys of that State. There are 1,507 
boys in the Louisiana clubs. An exhibit of 97 hogs owned by pig- 
club boys was made at the State fair. Some of these hogs were 
shipped over 250 miles to the fair and af least 50 of them would have 
made a creditable exhibit anywhere. There are 30 agricultural 
schools in Louisiana, and pig clubs have been organized at most of 
them. In Alabama the pig-club work was started late, but 10 counties 
have been organized and the work is proving popular. 
When the girls’ canning clubs were first organized by the agents of 
the farmers’ cooperative demonstration work, it was proposed to make 
them poultry clubs as well. In fact, the official name is “ Girls’ can- 
ning and poultry clubs.” For various reasons the poultry side of their 
work was neglected, largely on account of the lack of poultry experts. 
The bureau was asked to supply such experts, and a beginning has 
been made by stationing a poultryman in Virginia whose duty is to 
organize the clubs and instruct the demonstration agents in the prin- 
ciples of poultry raising. Twelve clubs have been organized in three 
counties in that State, and the movement promises to spread with re- 
markable activity. : 
Many exhibitions and demonstrations were made at expositions and 
on educational trains by members of the staff of the Office of Public 
Roads. Representatives of this office delivered 504 lectures, addresses, 
and papers in 39 States, including the District of Columbia. One 
new feature of this class of work consists in the lectures delivered be- 
fore graded schools and summer schools. Three lecturers gave 51 
addresses before school children in 13 States and the District of 
Columbia, and five. other representatives of the oflice gave 21 lectures 
before educational institutions of college rank in various parts of 
the country. 
The office has continued its policy of appointing graduates in civil 
engineering from the leading engineering institutions in the United 
States to the position of engineer student. During the fiscal year  
-P-A-G-E-274
  220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
1918 three highway engineers took furloughs from their positions in 
the Office of Public Roads to accept service in connection with road 
work in different parts of the country. 
The same course of training as in former years has been given to 
the scientific appointees, and promotions are controlled by merit as 
before. The making of models of road and bridge work for use in 
educational institutions and exhibits is pushed more than ever before. 
More models are constructed and more extensive use is make of them, 
EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS. 
The educational work of the Office of Experiment Stations has 
included the following lines of work: 
1. Studies of agricultural schools with reference to the agricul 
tural subjects which are or should be taught therein and the require- 
ments of such schools as regards the subject matter of agricultural 
instruction and the facilities for such instruction, including text- 
books, manuals, bulletins, apparatus, and illustrative material. 
2. The preparation of publications for use in schools where agri- 
culture is taught. These publications are chiefly based on the publi- 
cations of the Department of Agriculture and the State experiment 
stations. 
3. Special sets of lantern slides with lecture outlines accompany- 
ing them have been prepared. Of the special sets the following are 
prepared especially for school use: (1) The preparation and use of 
illustrative material for elementary agriculture, (2) agricultural 
education for negroes, (3) community work in the rural high school, 
(4) some types of children’s gardens in the United States, (5) some 
features of high-school instruction in agriculture, and (6) the de- 
velopment of children’s gardens in cities in the United States. 
4. Continuance of the review of the world’s literature of agricul- 
tural education in the Experiment Station Record. 
5.-A card directory of American teachers and investigators in 
agriculture has been revised and now contains about 2,500 names. 
This directory is maintained for the convenience of agricultural 
colleges and other institutions seeking trained teachers and investi- 
gators. s 
OCCURRENCES IN OTHER LANDS. 
THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF AGRICULTURE. 
A section of the Tenth International Congress of Agriculture, 
which was held at Ghent, Belgium, June 8-11, dealt with agricul- 
tural science and education. A detailed summary as to the status 
of agricultural research in various countries was presented by M. 
Toussaint, and an extended discussion followed. Among the con- 
   
-P-A-G-E-275
PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13, 221 
clusions ratified by the section were the following: Researeh ‘in- 
stitutions should be directed by scientists trained in experimental 
work; educational institutions should provide special facilities for 
research workers; the work of research should be separated, both 
as to location and supervision, from disciplinary duties, and absolute 
freedom from dictation of results should be guaranteed; research 
workers should keep in touch with original work elsewhere, and 
they should be assisted in this as follows: (1) Each publication re- 
lating to original work should be accompanied by a short summary; 
(2) each nation should issue an abstract journal summarizing its 
work, and (3) the publications of the International Institute of 
Agriculture at Rome should be extended to include abstracts of all 
research work. Each national department of agriculture should 
also provide a section for the dissemination and popularization of 
results of research. 
It was agreed that each agricultural educational institution, irre- 
spective of grade, should have available a tract of land for its work. 
No decision was reached as to the question of restricting stations 
attached to colleges to purely research work. Further consideration 
of a new system of classifying experiments on the basis of altitude 
instead of latitude was favored. 
One session of the section was devoted to the subject of agricul- 
tural instruction. Following a discussion by M. Pasteur, the section 
voted that the organization of professional agricultural education 
is highly desirable in every country and that instruction methods 
should be used which develop the child’s powers of observation and 
reflection. This section also favored beginning agricultural train- 
ing at 12 years of age, and holding special courses arranged on a 
part-time basis for those engaged in farm work. It was the prevail- 
ing opinion that the agricultural work in special schools should be 
given by specialists and that normal courses should embody in their 
fourth year a large amount of practical work.    
AFRICA, 
The South African Union has offered five Government scholar- 
ships to sons of permanent residents of South Africa for study in 
agriculture abroad. The holders of the scholarships will receive $750 
per annum for a period of from three to four years, and will be 
pledged then to enter the service of the Union for not less than three 
years at a salary of at least $1,500 per annum. 
LATIN AMERICA, 
A large number of candidates have this year presented themselves 
for matriculation at the agricultural coileges and apprentice schools 
of Brazil. The intermediate or theoretical-practical school at Bahia, 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
   
   222. EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
with which an apprentice school is connected, now has an attendance 
of 56 pupils, and a similar school attached to the Federal stud farm 
at Pinheiro has been opened with an enrollment of 35 students for 
the first year’s course. 
Additional apprentice schools have been established at Tubarao, 
on ground given by the State of Santa Catharina; at Satuba, in the 
former agronomic station and stud farm at Santa Luzia de Norte, 
given by the State of Alagoas; at Igarape, on the former Augusto 
Montenegro Experimental Farm, given by the State of Para; and 
at Guimaraes, in Maranhao. Measures are also in progress for the 
installation of an apprentice school at Sao Simao, in the State of 
Sao Paulo. Technical agricultural instruction is given by traveling 
professors and instructors apportioned to different zones in accord- 
ance with their respective productions. 
Two permanent dairy schools have been opened, one at Sao Joao 
del Rey, and the other at Barbacena, and the Government is con- 
sidering the establishment of a school of horticulture im some suit- 
able locality. A bill was approved December 17, 1912, authorizing 
the establishment of schools of practical plowing and stations for 
the experimental culture of tobacco, cotton, and cereals at Angatuba, 
Porto Feliz, Capao Bonito do Paranapanema, Guarehy, and Sara- 
puhy. 
The agricultural normal school at Santiago; Chile, is under re- 
organization, and its activities will be devoted entirely to agricul- 
tural subjects under rules and regulations to be issued by executive 
authority. The agricultural schools at Chillan, Concepcion, and 
Cauquenes will also be reorganized; and $10,950 has been appro- 
priated for each of two agricultural schools to be established at 
Aconcagua and Rancagua, respectively. An agricultural congress, 
an exposition of agricultural machinery, and a stock show will be 
held in Concepcion during the latter part of October, 1913. 
The Government of Colombia has accepted eight scholarships, 
including four in the school of agriculture and one in the veterinary 
school of the University of Santiago, offered to Colombian students 
by the Government of Chile. 
The Haitian Government has made an appropriation for the estab- 
lishment of an agricultural school, and negotiations are under way 
to engage professors from abroad to give instruction in the latest 
scientific agricultural methods. In the meantime, the secretary of 
agriculture proposes the organization of a traveling school of agri- 
culture and that instructors be sent from place to place in the 
coffee-producing regions to teach the producers how to improve their 
plantations, etc. He proposes also the establishment of experimental 
agricultural fields in the coffee and cacao producing regions, to teach 
the farmers the rudiments of scientific farming. A bill was passed  
-P-A-G-E-277
  PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13. 223 
last July establishing an agricultural school in the Department of 
the West. 
Rafael Bustillo has been appointed assistant director of the school 
for the cultivation of tobacco at Danli, Honduras. This school has 
a considerable number of students, and under its influence the culti- 
vation of tobacco in the Republic has greatly increased during the 
past few years. 
BRITISH ISLANDS. 
Prof. Bryner Jones, principal of the agricultural department of 
the University College of Wales, at Aberystwith, has been selected 
as the first commissioner of agriculture for Wales. His primary 
duty is to advise the board of agriculture and fisheries as to pros- 
pective grants from the development fund to Wales and on the 
agricultural work of the country generally. There will also be an 
agricultural council for Wales, which will meet every six months for 
the discussion of agricultural questions. 
Steps are in progress at the University of Bristol to increase mate- 
rially its activities in agricultural education and research. The uni- 
versity has recently become associated with the National Fruit and 
Cider Institution, established near Bristol in 1903 to carry on inves- 
tigations in fruit culture and cider making, and it will receive an 
annual grant of $12,500 from the development commission for re- 
search in fruit growing and fruit diseases. The university will also 
obtain $25,000 additional from the development commission for the 
purchase of and and the erection of laboratories and other buildings; 
it has raised a like amount from other sources for these purposes. 
The foundation stone of a new agricultural college, provided for 
in a bequest of the late C. S. Hayne, was laid on an estate of over 
200 acres, near Newton Abbott, Devonshire. About $500,000 is avail- 
able for the institution, of which $100,000 will be utilized for build- 
ings, and the remainder will be held as a fund for administrative 
purposes. The institution will provide agricultural instruction and 
will also become a research center for the region. 
An Imperial Bureau of Entomology has been definitely organized 
under the financial support of the British Government and _ its 
various dominions and colonies. It supersedes the entomological 
research committee appointed in 1909, that body now becoming an 
honorary committee of management of the new bureau, with the Earl 
of Cromer as its president and scientific secretary. Guy A. K. 
Marshall has been appointed director of the bureau and editor of 
the Review of Applied Entomology. That journal was established 
in January, 1913, and is published monthly in two parts—Series A 
dealing with agricultural entomology and Series B with medical and 
veterinary entomology. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  
  224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
In addition to the publication of this journal, the functions of the 
bureau are announced as including the making of a general survey 
of the noxious insects of the world, the collection and coordination of 
information relating thereto, and the authoritative identification of 
insects of economic importance when submitted by the departments 
of agriculture and public health of the British Empire. It will also 
continue the publication of the Bulletin of Entomological Research. 
CANADA, 
The Government of Canada has appropriated $10,000,000 to cover 
a period of 10 years beginning with the year ending March 31, 
1914, for instruction and research in agriculture. This fund is to 
be distributed among the Provinces according to population. The 
sum of $700,000 will be allotted the first year and this amount will 
be increased by $100,000 annually until 1917, from which year, until 
1923, $1,100,000 will be provided annually. 
The work of the Federal department of agriculture is to be aided 
by assisting and developing the live stock, dairying, fruit growing, 
and other industries along lines of investigation, research, improve- 
ment in transportation, markets, etc. The assistance to be given to 
agricultural education will include increasing the facilities and 
equipment of the agricultural colleges, the establishment of agri- 
cultural, dairy, and horticultural schools and short courses, the 
introduction of agricultural teaching into the public schools, and agri- 
cultural extension work. The sum of $20,000 a year will be divided 
between veterinary colleges which grant degrees and come up to a 
required standard, and an additional sum of $20,000 annually will 
be allotted to each Province regardless of population. Federal super- 
vision over the expenditures by the Provinces is provided, and there 
will be Federal inspection of the work done and a detailed annual 
report will be made to Parliament. 
The Manitoba Provincial Department of Education is endeavor- 
ing to introduce agricultural teaching into the secondary schools of 
the Province. As a result of its efforts, two townships have agreed 
to appoint an agricultural instructor, and the Stonewall High School 
began instruction last year. The Government is to pay one-half the 
salaries and otherwise assist in making the course successful. Regu- 
Jar short courses were scheduled from November 1 to April 1, cov- 
ering work as nearly as possible in line with that done in the first 
two years of an agricultural college course. Experimental or demon- 
stration work will also be carried on by students on their own farms 
under the supervision of the instructor. 
Since the opening of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College at 
Truro about eight years ago the attendance on the regular and short 
courses has increased from 85 to 450. The main building has been
-P-A-G-E-279
  PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13, 225 
doubled in capacity, and a horticultural building, with greenhouses 
and provision for the entomological department, and a modern horse 
barn have been erected, and about 40 acres have been added to the 
farm. 
Ten-day courses were held for the first time on Prince Edward 
Island, at Charlottetown, from January 27 to February 8. These 
courses included instruction in live stock, poultry, horticulture, soil 
cultivation, seed selection, dairying, and home economics for women. 
Half-fare railway rates were secured for all who attended, and 
scholarships valued at $5, together with free transportation, were 
furnished those completing the course satisfactorily. 
FRANCE. 
A law of August 21, 1912, reorganizes the departmental and eom- 
munal agricultural instruction in France. It establishes in each 
Department a bureau of agricultural services, to replace the depart- 
mental professors of agriculture previously authorized. This bureau 
is to have charge of the dissemination of agricultural knowledge, 
agricultural instruction in public educational institutions, economic 
and social aspects of agriculture, including agricultural insurance 
and rural hygiene, agricultural information, statistics, direction of 
experiment fields, technical researches and commissions, and in a 
general way of all agricultural interests, with the exception of the 
veterinary and forestry services in the agricultural stations. 
The departmental professors of agriculture will be known here- 
after as the directors of the agricultural services and will be as- 
sisted by special professors in charge of certain local districts. Both 
the special professors and directors will be subject to the general 
supervision of the Minister of Agriculture. 
INDIA, 
A scheme for the establishment of a staff of district vernacular 
agriculturists in Burma has been sanctioned as an experimental 
measure, and six men have been selected for a nine months’ course 
of training as district agriculturists, which ended March 1. Special 
emphasis was laid on practical agriculture, but instruction was given 
also in the theory of agriculture, chemistry, the elements of botany 
and entomology, principles of cooperation, and the general duties of 
district agriculturists. Twenty students not applicants for the posi- 
tion of district agriculturist were also admitted to the course. 
Under the scheme for the development of technical education, 
school gardening and nature study will be introduced into the schools 
of the large Christian Karen community. The local government

made a grant of $1,600 for equipment at Shwegyin and Ngaunglebin, 
where school gardens have been started, and instruction in agriculture 
and nature study is given by two Karens, who were trained at Man- 
dalay. The Karen National Association has offered substantial 
financial assistance, and the Department of Agriculture is also giving 
its support. A book on school gardening has been prepared by C. 
Thomstone, deputy director of agriculture. 
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. 
Under a law enacted by the Philippine Legislature February 7, 
1918, the director of agriculture is authorized to establish and main- 
tain stations for practical agricultural instruction and to organize 
and develop a system of cooperative agricultural instruction in such 
branches as soil selection and culture, the growing of vegetables, 
fruits, cereals, and other crops, the production of improved seeds and 
plants for distribution, and animal husbandry. The administration 
of these stations will rest with the director of agriculture, and with 
the approval of the secretary of public instruction he may appoint 
superintendents and all other employees, obtain lands, buildings, etc., 
and in general supervise the work of the stations. If deemed desir- 
able, stations may be established by the bureau of agriculture in 
cooperation with any province, municipality, or agricultural asso- 
ciation of the islands. The act became effective July 1, 1913, and 
carried an appropriation of 150,000 pesos ($75,000). 
Twenty additional scholarships in the Forest School, at Los Banos, 
Laguna, have been established, apportioned among the various prov- 
inces and awarded on a competitive basis. Holders of these scholar- 
ships are to be employed by the bureau of forestry for a period equal 
to that occupied by the courses of instruction. 
SPAIN, 
A royal decree of April 11, 1918, provides for introducing instruc- 
tion for the training of agricultural experts (Perites agricolas) into 
the regional practical schools of agriculture at Valladolid and Zara- 
goza and the agricultural station at Albacete. The instruction will 
be given in three courses, the first two to continue from October 1 
to May 31, respectively, and the third, during the summer months, 
will be devoted to farm practice. Students obtaining the title Perito 
agricola will be eligible to the position of assistant in the agricultural 
service.

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN EDUCATIONAL CONVENTIONS. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT STATIONS, 
The twenty-sixth annual convention of the Association of Ameri- 
can Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations was held at At- 
Janta, Ga., November 13-15, 1912. Four very interesting historical 
papers read at this meeting described the growth and development of 
the land-grant colleges, the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture, and the Experiment Stations. This part of the program cele- 
brated the fiftieth anniversary of the Morrill Act, approved July 2, 
1862, in accordance with which the land-grant colleges have been es- 
tablished, and the organization of the United States Department of 
Agriculture under the act of May 15, 1862. It also marked the 
twenty-fifth anniversary of the Hatch Act, which gave us the Experi- 
ment Stations. 
Dr. A. C. True, Director of Office of Experiment Stations, chairman 
of the committee on instruction in agriculture, made a report on 
the work of the agricultural colleges in the training of teachers of 
agriculture for secondary schools, which included the following 
recommendations: 
Teachers of agriculture in secondary schools should have not less than 20 
semester hours of professional training, including instruction in educational 
psychology, history of education, pedagogy, and special school methods appli- 
eable to agriculture in the secondary schools, supplemented by practice 
teaching. 
In all- sections of the convention where the matter of courses of 
study was discussed there was an expression of a desire for differen- 
tiation, and for a broad general course in undergraduate work with 
specialization in graduate work. Agricultural colleges must now 
prepare the practical farmer, the technical man for experiment sta- 
tion work, teachers of agriculture, and extension workers. It was 
the prevailing opinion that the same course would not do for all four 
classes, but that there is danger in differentiation until after the 
foundation is laid in general subjects, 
In the extension-service session of the meeting some time was spent 
in discussion of the relation of the extension service to the public 
schools, of leaflets and bulletins, of teachers’ institute, boys’ and girls’ 
club work, ete. 
The work of the land-grant colleges was well summed up by Dr. 
W. A. Thompson, president of Ohio State University. In speaking 
of the influence of the Morrill Act upon American higher education, 
he said in part: 
The influences of the land-grant colleges upon higher education would, among 
other things, include the following:
-P-A-G-E-282
  228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
First, they have greatly stimulated the interest of the people in higher educa- 
tion as manifested by unparalleled appropriations. I shall not trouble you with 
the figures, since it is a matter of common observation that the revenues pro- 
vided for higher education in the several States have already passed the fondest 
hopes and the most vivid imagination of the men who organized these colleges. 
‘They have been limited only by the State’s ability to provide. They have rarely, 
if ever, been the occasion of popular discontent, political overthrow, or corrupt 
management. The young men and young women enjoying the benefits of these 
institutions have in a large majority of instances justified the expenditures. 
Second, the debates clustering about the passage of the land-grant act, 
coupled with the experience of the colleges, have set a precedent aud proved the 
wisdom of Federal aid to education.. The fact that certain limitations have 
been put upon the expenditure of money provided by the Federal Government is 
to be interpreted as directive and not as setting a limit to the Federal Govern- 
ment’s activities. I am out of sympathy with the theory that the Federal 
Government may promote industrial or vocational education exclusively. 
Third, the experience and history of these colleges"have brought industrial 
education to its rightful place in the esteem of the American people and have 
forced its recognition by all institutions for higher education. 
Fifth, these institutions have stimulated investigation and research in many 
fields. I shall not assume that the only investigations in applied science are 
to be found within the walls of the land-grant colleges, but it is safe to say 
that these same colleges have stimulated other institutions to carry their inves- 
tigations into fields that might have been neglected but for the sympathetic 
interest aroused in agricultural colleges and experiment stations. 
Sixth, while not specifically related to the topic of this paper, I can not re- 
frain from suggesting that the influence of these colleges upon:the Government 
itself has had something to do with the cause of higher education. 
I am disposed, therefore, to believe that the Government’s entrance into the 
cause of education has resulted in making it more humane, more just, less to 
be feared, and more to be loved. I know of no agency that has done more to 
unite the North and the South, the East and the West, in a bond of common 
patriotism than the activities of the Government arising out of the organization 
of the Department of Agriculture, the. land-grant colleges, and the experiment 
stations, 
The semicentennial and the quarto centennial of these institutions seem, 
therefore, an appropriate time to express our appreciation of what these insti- 
tutions have been, of what they are becoming, of what they have done, and to 
renew our patriotic devotion to the agencies that have done so much for the 
uplifting and inspiration of the common people. 
THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL TEACHING. 
The third annual meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Agricultural Teaching convened at Atlanta, Ga., 
November 12, 1912. The program was devoted principally to a dis- 
cussion of the method of teaching agriculture in the high school and 
the preparation of teachers for this work. 
The opportunity and responsibilities of agricultural colleges for 
the preparation of teachers of agriculture were discussed from two 
standpoints, viz: (a) In the regular courses and classes, by Dean 
H. L. Russell, University of Wisconsin, and (4) in special courses 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13, 229 
and classes by Dr. Kenyon L. Butterfield, president of Massachusetts 
Agricultural College. In discussing these papers D. J. Crosby, of 
the United States Department of Agriculture, emphasized the im- 
portance of giving attention to the professional side of the teacher’s 
training course, while R. W. Stimson, of the Massachusetts Board of 
Education, thought that not enough time is given to agricultural 
subjects. 
W. G. Hummel, of California, discussed the content of the first 
year’s work in high-school agriculture. He suggested the need of a 
general course to give the student the proper foundation: for the 
science he will study later. His course, as outlined, called for prac- 
tical exercises both in the laboratory and the field, which include the 
elementary principles of the various sciences. This plan Mr. Hum- 
mel has found to succeed in high schools where he has tried it. 
F. B. Jenks, of the Bureau of Education, leading the discussion of 
this paper, suggested that the course should be adapted to the needs 
of the community and designed to encourage more boys to enter high 
school by offering subjects that would appeal to them as being of 
practical value. 
R. W. Stimson presented an interesting report on the use of land 
in connection with the teaching of agriculture. 
The principal papers read at this meeting were published as Bulle- 
tin, 1918, No. 14, of the Bureau of Education. 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE. 
The annual meeting of the Department of Superintendence of the 
National Education Association was held in Philadelphia, Febru- 
ary 24-28, 1913. The emphasis of this meeting was placed very 
largely upon industrial and vocational education, agricultural educa- 
tion receiving its full share in the discussions. 
The committee on agriculture held two sessions. The first was 
devoted principally to the methods of introducing agriculture and 
manual training into schools without special teachers or supervisors. 
At the second session the boys’ and girls’ club movement was dis- 
cussed. Suggestions were made as to the advisability of holding 
State and National exhibits upon a systematic and uniform basis, 
but no definite action was taken in the matter. 
At the session of the School Garden Association of America it was. 
urged that use be made of vacant lots in cities and towns for school 
gardens and agricultural teaching of pupils having no available land 
at home and thet wherever possible the pupils should be encouraged 
to carry on this garden work and agricultural project at home. 
School credit for home work was advocated by several speakers, 
notably L. R. Alderman, State superintendent of public instruction 
of Oregon.

   230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The tenor of the whole meeting was a plea for a better under- 
standing between educator and layman and for closer cooperation 
between all educational forces. 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
Rural betterment was the central theme of the sixteenth annual 
conference for education in the South, held at Richmond, Va., April 
15-18, 1913. There were sessions devoted to cooperation, farm dem- 
onstrations, the country church, education of women, problems of the 
rural school, training and certification of teachers, college extension, 
the trend of negro education, ete. 
Cooperation was the keynote of the conference, which was com- 
posed of farmers, business men, clergymen, school-teachers, superin- 
tendents, supervisors, and representatives from normal schools, 
colleges, and universities. 
There was no theorizing nor painting of ideal pictures, but a 
thoroughgoing discussion of present-day topics, all viewed from the 
practical standpoint of everyday life and conditions which exist in 
the Southern States. 
Abstracts of the principal papers read at this meeting were pub- 
lished as Bulletin, 1913, No. 30, Bureau of Education. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AT OTHER CONY 
  TIONS. 
The seventeenth annual meeting of the American Association of 
Farmers’ Institute Workers was held November 11-13, at Atlanta, 
Ga., with representatives from 36 States, 2 Provinces of Canada, 
Porto Rico, and the District of Columbia. 
The address of the president, Franklin Dye, was a discussion of 
the general agricultural situation in the United States and specifically 
of some of the problems with which the farmers’ institutes must deal. 
Among these were waste through improper farming, lack of method 
in marketing, and waste of food in the kitchen and of plant food on 
the farms and through the maintenance of unprofitable animals. 
The committee upon institute organization and methods recom- 
mended a change of the organization unit, holding that the county 
is too large an area in most of the States, and that with the township 
or community unit, all farmers could attend, and monthly meetings 
could be held in many localities. The committee on cooperation with 
other educational agencies recommended the appointment of a na- 
tional commission on agricultural education, whose duty it should be 
to map out the fundamental functions of the different types of educa- 
tional institutions, and to recommend ways in which a balanced 
system of agricultural education can be developed with the greatest 
efficiency and a minimum of duplication. This matter was referred to      
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13, 231 
the executive committee for action. Reports were received from the 
committees on institute lecturers, movable schools of agriculture, and 
women’s institutes. 
The first topic in the general program. was the special province of 
the farmers’ institute. The conclusions reached were that there should 
be in the modern institute meeting a well-defined purpose to make it 
prepare for more specialized and advanced kinds of extension. The 
field of the institute is distinctive, but not exclusive, and lies chiefly 
in new territory where there are no facilities for such undertakings as 
farmers’ short courses and the like. The institute also has a place in 
organized territory where the short course has come, the agricultural 
train has passed, and the movable school of agriculture has been held. 
As regards the relative value to the farmers of the one-day and two 
or three day institutes, it was concluded that one-day institutes, 
although requiring the maximum expense in time and travel, are use- 
ful and economical in communities where the families are widely 
scattered or where the institute habit has not been established. Two- 
day institutes are a logical sequence to the one-day institute, and 
more economical of time in the field. The three-day institute enables 
the workers to do a higher grade of instruction work so far as the 
individual is concerned, but reaches fewer persons. All three types 
are deemed necessary, according to the special needs of each 
community. 
THE AMERICAN FARM MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. 
The third annual meeting of the American Farm Management 
Association was held at Washington, D. C., January 21-23. The 
presidential address was delivered by W. J. Spillman, of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, on “The new point of view.” It discussed in 
detail some of the fundamental principles of farm management work. 
The initial session of the meeting discussed the subject of the teach- 
ing of farm management. A report from the standing committee was 
presented by G. F. Warren, of Cornell University, and “The qualifi- 
cations of the teacher of farm management” were discussed by H. 
Hayward, of the Delaware College and Station. An address on 
“Teaching farm management in the consolidated rural school” was 
given by Assistant Secretary Hays of the Department of Agricul- 
ture, in which he spoke optimistically of the possibilities in this 
direction. 
A. Boss described the pian now on trial at the University of Minne- 
sota, by which a few selected senior students in farm management are 
put in charge of private farms leased to the university. Each student 
manages a farm for one year under the close supervision of the insti- 
tution. A special certificate in addition to the bachelor’s degree is 
awarded upon the successful completion of this work, and the student

232 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1913. 
is also entitled to any profits up to $50 a month which he may be 
able to obtain. 
D. Hi. Otis explained a vacation course offered at the University of 
Wisconsin, in which about six boys are taken for an inspection trip 
of from. three to six weeks. During this trip they live in tents, 
making preliminary surveys and maps of the localities visited, and 
otherwise familiarize themselves with local details. A general dis- 
cussion of teaching methods followed, much interest being manifested 
in ways of increasing a student’s efficiency along practical lines. 
NATIONAL CORN EXPOSITION. 
The Fifth Annual Corn Exposition, which was held at Columbia, 
S. C., January 27 to February 8, was of large educational-significance. 
A. total of 67,000 square feet of floor space, with a liberal annex, was 
filled with exhibits from about 25 agricultural colleges and experi- 
ment stations and from the Department of Agriculture. One feature 
of the exhibit of the Department of Agriculture which attracted 
much attention was a cattle-dipping tank, with which daily demon- 
strations in tick eradication were given. 
Some very striking exhibits were also made by many of the 
agricultural colleges and experiment stations, as well as by other 
educational institutions. The station exhibits for the most part dealt 
especially with some one important phase of their work. Thus, 
Cornell gave special prominence to plant breeding, Kansas to animal 
husbandry, Rhode Island to the use of lime and other fertilizers, and 
Ohio to soil fertility. A model rural community. center from Illinois 
-attracted much attention, as did an exhibit by Winthrop College of 
three model farms for southern conditions. Much prominence was 
also accorded the boys’ corn clubs and girls’ tomato clubs. 
NEW YORK CHILD-WELFARE COMMITTEE. 
Under the auspices of the New York child-welfare committee the 
second conference dealing with problems relating to the education of 
dependent and delinquent boys and girls was held in New York City 
March 7-8, 1913. 
This conference was devoted particularly to instruction and train- 
ing in the trades, but there were numerous incidental references to 
agricultural education. An evening session was devoted to an illus- 
trated lecture dealing with agricultural education at the Lincoln 
Agricultural School, Lincolndale, N. Y., and at the Berkshire Farm 
School, Canaan, N. Y. On the afternoon of the second day there 
were round-table conferences on home economics, agricultural educa- 
tien, equipment for industrial departments, and industries for crip- 
pled children.
-P-A-G-E-287
PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN 1912-13, 233 
The conference on agricultural education dealt particularly with 
individual projects for boys in institutions and the remuneration of 
boys for their services in such institutions. It was the consensus of 
opinion that, so far as possible, individual projects should be pro- 
vided for, and the boys should be given some pecuniary interest in 
the yields from these projects. However, it was pointed out that in 
State institutions it is practically impossible to secure funds to pay 
students or inmates for their services, and a resolution was adopted 
by the conference looking to the correction of this difficulty in New 
York.     
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF POULTRY INSTRUCTORS AND INVESTIGATORS. 
The first conference of the International Association of Poultry 
Instructors and Investigators took place in London, England, July 
18-24, with 27 countries represented. Lord Lucas, parliamentary 
secretary of the board of agriculture and fisheries, welcomed the 
delegates on the part of the British Government. He stated that the 
establishment of a national poultry institute is under consideration 
for the scientific study of questions related to poultry husbandry 
and for training instructors for the county work. 
A permanent organization was effected, E. Brown, of London, 
England, being chosen president, and Dr. Raymond Pearl, of the 
Maine Experiment Station, secretary. 
A resolution was adopted providing for holding in 1914 a world’s 
poultry congress, representing all sections of the industry. The 
association voted to institute fellowships to be conferred on such 
persons as shall have rendered service of the highest distinction to 
the advancement of the poultry industry. These fellowships are to 
be conferred by vote of the entire association, and are restricted in 
number to five every three years. 
A central bureau of information will be established, located for the 
present in London. Tt will contain an historical section, iHustrative 
material, ete. ‘The publication of a journal is also contemplated. 
ILLINOIS FEDERATION FOR COUNTRY-LIFE PROGRESS. 
A State conference on country life was held at De Kalb, IIL, 
August 1 and 2, which called together representatives of every type 
of rural organization and discussed all phases of country life. A 
unique and helpful feature of this conference was a country-life 
exhibit, to which many local and national organizations contributed. 
The Datcccuce was the second annual meeting of the Ilinois federa- 
tion for country-life progress, a State-wide organization designed 
to unite all rural-progress agencies of Illinois in one large, compre- 
hensive campaign for the improvement of country life.

CHAPTER X. 
TENDENCIES IN COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
By Joszrn Frencx Jounson, 
Dean of the School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance, New York University. 
CoNnTENTS.—Life experience of workmen’s sons—Three conspicuous movements—German continuation 
schools—Coordination schools—University schools of commerce—Commerc:al education fostered by 
private corporations—Extension work in commercial subjects—Conclusion. 
LIFE EXPERIENCE OF WORKMEN’S SONS. 
The most important tendency in commercial education in the past 
year is the growing desire to place stress on vocational guidance. 
Out of the mass of statistics that have been compiled the life experi- 
rience of the average child of the workingman of the Nation can be 
seen to run somewhat like this: The parent desires to give his child 
the advantages of education. He realizes, however, that the child 
will soon have to be an economic factor in his family, and with the 
rising cost of living the change from student to wage earner is immi- 
nent. He, therefore, tries to crowd in as much vocational education 
as possible. The average teacher of the child is anxious to spell suc- 
cess out of the success of his student, and everywhere we find the 
school reaching out to the industry to get it to recognize the value of 
the school’s service by buying the school’s product. The employer 
realizes the value of the training and comes to the school for service. 
He is well pleased with the graduates of the school, and makes fur- 
ther offers, with the result that pressure is brought upon the child, 
first, by economic necessity of the family, and, second, by the economic 
demands of industry, to discontinue his educational process and to 
become a wage earner at an early age. At the time the child’s class- 
mates have graduated he has worked himself up to the place where 
his services are more valuable than those of the graduates just going 
into business life. Gradually the graduates creep up, reach him, and 
pass him; and after this process has gone on for three or four years 
the child, now grown to be a young man, realizes that he has lost 
something, and then looks about for some way to repair the damage. 
He has learned something in the school of experience, he is energetic 
235
-P-A-G-E-290
  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
and ambitious, and he is the typical man who secks to enter upon 
the extension work of universities. 
It is unnecessary to quote from any of the many reports of educa- 
tional experts on the subject. The general consensus of opinion 
seems to be that some way out of the present difficulty must be found, 
and that the high mortality in the commercial high schools must be 
offset either by some form of inducement to keep the student in the 
school or by some form of education for those who withdraw. Un- 
doubtedly we are looking to Germany to solve the problem. Edu- 
cational experts are expecting to find in that country the means as 
well as the experience. 
THREE CONSPICUOUS MOVEMENTS. 
Three distinct movements are on foot to make commercial educa- 
tion serve the purpose of helping students in the conditions in which 
they find themselves: (1) Continuation schools; (2) coordination 
schools; (3) university schools of commerce. 
The work of the German continuation schools has not been very 
widely tried in America. Possibly the best example is in Wisconsin. 
The following report of the work is taken from the bulletin No. 34, 
Report of the Committee on Industrial Education, H. E. Miles, 
Chairman, at the Eighteenth Annual Convention of the National 
Association of Manufacturers, Detroit, Mich., May 21, 1913: 
Wisconsin two years hence will have from 20,000 to 40,000 who are or have been in 
her industrial continuation schools, many of them splendid in promise, ability, and 
enthusiasm. Indeed to-day enough students could be found to make several trade 
schools larger than any now in America, and every one an extra good man. 
The trade school of the future will be far less on the order of a close corporation, far 
less for the favored few only—favored financially, not intellectually. 
It will give the utmost of opportunity to the bright fellow who can come nights 
only, or only a few hours of daytime per week, also to the half-time “cooperative” 
students, who by special arrangement between school and factory take “a week 
about’’ between school and factory, as in the Cincinnati College of Engineering, where 
under natural selection factory workers are being lifted from the lower levels to the 
top places in American engineering, earning their way splendidly as they go. And, 
lastly, those who can spend all the time in study will be cared for somewhat as at 
present, but with greater care for the individual as such and less of pressure into 
classes and squads as such. 
We may well be grateful to the directors of trade schools for doing what the country 
has permitted them to do these long years. None will rejoice more than they in the 
coming new industrial continuation schools and the new trade schools, and none are 
doing more to hasten the day of general trade education of the masses with their mil- 
lions of pupils to attend the trade schools of the future. 
Compulsory attendance from the fourteenth to the sixteenth year (better the seven- 
teenth or eighteenth) is necessary for children in employment, and for that 50 per 
cent of the children of the Nation who leave school by the end of the sixth grade. 
Anything else is a continued playing and compromising with right and necessity. 
This education is not a boon nor a privilege. On the part of the child it is a birth-
-P-A-G-E-291
  TENDENCIES IN COMMERCIAL EDUCATION, 237 
right. On the part of the State it is absolutely necessary for the safety and advance- 
ment of society. To leave attendance optional is to substitute for necessity and right 
personal preferences, good nature, and more or less cheap persuasion. It is to have 
some employers and some parents do right because they are willing, and others sacri- 
fice the children intrusted to them for any one of a thousand cheap excuses. When 
any State, notably one like Massachusetts, seeing the right, so legislates, argument 
and cavil cease, and the public in short order happily conforms. 
There is no chance that Wisconsin will be overproud or overconfident in her work. 
She will have to demonstrate continually that her industrial continuation schools are 
real industrial continuation schools and not merely general continuation schools with 
a smattering of the industrial. She is simply doing the altogether common-sense and 
ordinary thing, as previously done for 100 years in countries more enlightened educa- 
tionally. The last figures from Wisconsin are, however, a demonstration. 
Her laws were passed too late in 1911 for much to be accomplished in the school year 
1911-12. Only two schools were started with 700 pupils. Last fall about 30 schools 
were opened with from 3,000 to 5,000 pupils. In November the enrollment was 
10,000, and by February it had risen to 16,000. Half of the pupils, those between 14 
and 16, are enrolled under the compulsory attendance law; the others or the older ones 
are in voluntary attendance, mostly in the evening schools. The State limits its aid 
to 30 schools and $3,000 to any one school. The number of schools will be increased 
to 45 by the legislature now in session. The number of students next year will not be 
less than 25,000; it may be much more than that. 
The compulsory attendance is for only five hours a week, and the aid is limited to 
one-half the actual maintenance cost. Except in Milwaukee, the $3,000 limit will 
meet half the expense of each school, This expense per student year proves to be 
about $10. The students continue in employment and almost invariably, by grace of 
the employers, without loss of wages for the hours spent in school. Contrast this $10 
per year per student with the $30 average cost in the elementary schools of the country, 
$75 in the high schools, $100 to $250 in the so-called trade high schools, and $250 or 
more in trade schools, An additional $250 or $450 or more must be added to the latter 
figures, as the student’s loss of wages. 
It would seem that such figures as these should act as closure on debate, and cause 
everyone to turn his back upon the old attempts and give speedy and even-handed 
justice to the great body of the working people and their children through continuation 
schools. Too long haye Americans measured accomplishment by money expendi- 
ture and felt that big money appropriations are the surest way tq success. The wisdom 
of those who framed the Wisconsin laws on industrial education enables and requires 
her State and the local boards to make shrewd social engineering and cooperative 
effort take their proper place as infinitely better than great money expenditure. 
To care for her 16,000 students not a single building was erected; in only one city 
was there any outlay worth mentioning for rent, and the expenditure for equipment 
was very slight. 
While the continuation school gives practical. industrial training to the industrial 
worker after he has left the common schools, and usually gives him a total of only a half 
day’s or a day’s instruction per week, he being excused from employment for that time, 
it is by no means limited to this. In Fond du Lac two domestic servants are going from 
10 to 20 hours per week; two boys, working for their father, are going 10 and 15 hours. 
In Racine a boy of 16 who had worked only two days in two years was compelled to 
attend school five hours per week. After a few days he inquired: *‘Can’t I stay more 
than five hours?” He then went continually till he got a good job and then again for 
five hours.

GERMAN CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
We are still, however, in the research period, and are seeking infor- 
mation. One of the best statements of the work of the German 
continuation schools is that recently published under the auspices 
of the special committee on commercial education of the Chamber 
of Commerce of the State of New York, written by Dr. Kurt E. 
Richter. His conclusions are as follows: 
The question may finally be asked, Have these commercial institutions justified their 
existence? The factsthat they are so well patronized, that the number of them isslowly 
but constantly increasing, that the special training given in these institutions is more 
and more in demand, give a sufficiently satisfactory answer. 
Prof. Dr. M. J. Bonn, director of the Munich Commercial College, has pointedly 
stated the aim of these institutions by declaring that the student should acquire “‘the 
commercial spirit,” viz, he should be able to see the commercial situation in its true 
light, he should then possess the initiative to utilize this knowledge of the situation 
to his advantage, and finally he should have business sagacity enough to predict with 
fair accuracy the future trend of his own particular chosen business. This commercial 
spirit is the basis of all success. But it can not be emphasized too strongly that this 
commercial spirit must be counterbalanced by a broad and liberal education to prevent 
the business man from running into a rut and being reduced to a calculating mechan- 
ism. He should be not only an efficient business man, but also a thoroughly educated 
gentleman, broad minded, with liberal ideas, conversant on all topies, and thoroughly 
abreast and in sympathy with the times. He should be sufficiently conservative to 
appreciate the good in the old and sufficiently progressive to see and adopt the advan- 
tages of the new. Above all, he should be able to think and think rapidly, accurately, 
and deeply. Such men will necessarily meet with success in life. The man who can 
prove that he possesses “‘capital-producing” abilities is sought by capital more than 
anything else. Carnegie once declared that every large firm or organization is con- 
stantly searching for able and trained men; no article in the world’s market is so much 
in demand; none is so high in price. 
In 1904 Prof. Herrick, formerly of Philadelphia, stated that the entire system of 
German commercial education “‘may be charged with the defects of its virtues; those 
trained in it are well disciplined, but they are mechanical and sadly lacking in the 
individuality and initiative so characteristic of those trained in the schools of England 
and America.” This charge was based upon observations made prior to the estab- 
lishment of the last three colleges named and when the first three were still in their 
infancy and could not have any appreciable effect upon contemporary business life. 
* This criticism may in a measure be verified with reference to the commercial ‘middle 
schools” (similar to our ‘‘high schools”), but it lacks all justification when made in 
regard to these colleges. Even the ‘‘middle schools” have been constantly improved 
since the above criticism was made, so that Dr. William Maxwell, one of the advanced 
educational thinkers of the present time, in an address made December, 1912, in 
Cooper Union, New York City, could compliment the Leipzig Commercial School by 
stating that New York City’s High School of Commerce was modeled closely after that 
excellent institution. 
In conclusion, let us note some expressions of opinion upon higher commercial edu- 
cation in Germany by several leading American educators, who, through years of study 
and close observation, have become authorities on such matters. 
Tn an address before the Chamber of Commerce of California, President Wheeler, 
who spent years of study in Germany and who some time ago was exchange professor 
in Berlin, stated, in part: ‘Germany led the way in applying what the university had
-P-A-G-E-293

to teach to commerce and commercial problems. It has preeminence in production 
of dyestuffs, as it was the first to experiment with beet-root culture. Men said of 
both that they were vagaries of university men. You go out to-day into the nearer 
East and find in Asia Minor, in Turkey, in Greece—find everywhere—the German 
consul as a trade agent. He can speak the language of the country, read its news- 
papers, in short, isan integral part of the community. It is this ‘practical’ diplomacy 
as much as political diplomacy, that has made Germany what it is to-day. But never 
yet was a German consul appointed because he was ‘somebody’s man,’ but because 
he was ‘the’ man for the position.” 
Showing the need for a higher training of our own business men, he continued: 
“American merchants have found that we have become an exporting nation. Our 
politicians have exerted all efforts to devise means to keep other people’s wares out of _ 
the market, but now we ought to exert all efforts to trade with the whole world.” 
Dr. Edmund James, president of the State University of Illinois, recently said: 
“We Americans can learn more from Germany than from any other country. A land 
not as large as Texas which nevertheless supports a population two-thirds as large as 
that of the United States deserves to be studied more closely. Asan industrial State, 
Germany to-day stands in the front rank; German science occupies the first place, 
and also German literature and art can favorably be compared with any other art and 
literature.” 
Prof. Richard T. Ely, of the University of Wisconsin, just returning from a year of 
study spent in Germany, published the following interesting observations: ‘The 
progress which Germany has made during the past 20 years is eminent in every respect. 
Like a father, the State cares for its people. Every German who has not a definite 
income, as well as every official, must insure himself against accidents, sickness, etc. 
The State expends large sums annually in order to establish continuation schools, in 
which young laborers receive free instruction.” 
The commercial colleges of Germany, however, are not only training the leaders in 
business life, but are also destined to be the real training schools for the men of public 
affairs, for city and State officials, for domestic and diplomatic service. In performing 
this function these commercial colleges will exert the greatest influence upon both 
the commercial and the political development of the country and will thus become 
important factors in maintaining Germany in the present prominent place which it 
occupies in the council of the world’s great commercial powers. 
COORDINATION SCHOOLS. 
Much credit undoubtedly is due to Cincinnati for being a pioneer 
in coordination work in the United States. It has been most 
active in pushing its work and in collecting data upon which organ- 
ized coordinating work can be done in other cities. Already the idea 
has found favor in the high schools of Boston and some of the western 
cities. The following excerpt from a paper by Helen Thompson 
Woolley, director of child labor division, Cincinnati public schools, 
gives the method of coordination: * 
The second application I wish to make deals with a problem also previously dis- 
cussed in The Survey—the question as to whether vocational and industrial schools 
shall be organized from within our present school system and kept in organic relation 
withit, or shall be organized under a separate board made up not from the leaders of 
education, but from the leaders in industry. I would like to ask this question: Have 
the dealings of industry with children in the past been such as to warrant the State 
in turning over the training of the children destined for industry to the forces of 
  
1 The Survey, Aug. 9, 1913.

    240 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
industry itself? The report I have given shows t's) status of children under one of 
the best child-labor lawsin the country, wellenforced. There is very little suggestion 
of an educational attitude on the part of industry toward the children.! The un- 
doubted educational possibilities of the industries are left undeveloped, and it is 
exceedingly rare to have an interest in the development of the children prominent 
in the mind of the employer. This is a state of mind which is quite understandable. 
With the best intentions the employer can scarcely avoid viewing the educational 
problem first from the standpoint of the welfare of the industry. He wants more 
efficient workmen, first of all because the industry would profit by them. In his 
mind, the welfare of the worker must be a secondary result of the success of the in- 
dustry, and he has scant patience with any one who suggests moulding the industry 
to fit the needs of the workers. 
Now there is undoubtedly a sense in which the welfare of the worker is secondary 
to the success of the industry. It is an obvious enough fact that the industry must 
be successful enough to exist or the worker can not earn his living by it. But when 
the scale which measures the success of the industry is solely the profits of the em- 
ployer, it ceases to be true that the welfare of the industry and that of the worker 
must be the same. 
It makes a very great difference, then, whether those who mold the system of 
industrial education in this country have as their immediate object the development 
of industries in which the workers are first of all parts of the machine, or the develop- 
ment of well-rounded, intelligent citizens, who shall possess specific industrial ability 
as one phase of their training. The habit of mind of the educator would lead him to 
take the latter attitude, and that of the leader of industry the former. 
But the plan would be objectionable even if industry were so socialized that its 
leaders could be expected to view the problem of industrial education first from the 
standpoint of the development of the individual child. It would mean a sharp separa- 
tion at a comparatively early age of the children destined for industry from those 
destined for academic and professional careers. The decision would inevitably be made 
rather on the basis of the economic status of the family than on that of the child’s fitness. 
The plan would lead us directly toward class distinctions of a thoroughly undemo- 
cratic sort. As John Dewey has declared: ‘‘Those who believe in the continued 
separate existence of what they are pleased to call the lower classes or the laboring 
classes would naturally rejoice to have schools in which those classes would be segre- 
gated. And some employers of labor would doubtless rejoice to have schools supported 
by public taxation supply them with additional food for their mills. All others should 
be united against every proposition, in whatever form advanced, to separate training 
of employees from training for citizenship, training of intelligence and character 
from training for narrow industrial efficiency.” 
UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS OF COMMERCE. 
The third important movement which has made great headway 
in the development of higher education along commercial lines is in 
our universities. This form of education started in 1884 in the 
University of Pennsylvania, and in 1900 New York University estab- 
lished the first evening School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance. 
The schools have grown in number, and each school has largely 
increased its enrollments. During the academic year 1912-13, New 
York University had over 1,800 students on its rolls.   
1 The continuation schools for machine-shop apprentices in Cincinnati, which were started by the 
industries, are important exceptions to this statement, though they apply only to children over 16 years 
of age.

COMMERCIAL EDUCATION FOSTERED BY PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. 
Another form which commercial education has taken, and which 
promises to provide a very large part of all the commercial education 
in the country is that given by the various dustrial enterprises as 
part of their apprentice systems and welfare work. Late in Septem- 
ber, 1912, Dr. Lee Galloway, of New York University, with represen- 
tatives of some of the large: industries, began a movement for the 
formation of the National Association of Corporation Schools. The 
first meeting was held at New York University in January, 1913, and 
a large convention was held in Dayton, Ohio, under the auspices of 
the National Cash Register Co., in September, 1913. The avowed 
purpose of this association is to increase the efficiency of the individual 
employee, to inerease the efficiency im industry, and to influence the 
courses of established educational institutions more favorably toward 
industry. The association consists of about 100: members represent- 
ing all forms of industry in all parts of the country.

EXTENSION WORK IN COMMERCIAL SUBJECTS. 
Finally we must take some notice of the work of correspondence 
school and collegiate extension divisions of universities. 
The University of Wisconsin has established its extension depart- 
ments in every part of the city of Minneapolis, and is doing the 
same thing throughout the State. Even the privately endowed uni- 
versities in the East are establishing branches, which are usually 
known as ‘‘extramural divisions,” in various parts of the country. 
The movement everywhere is to serve the people. Private enterprises 
for teaching commercial subjects by mail have gained great headway, 
one reporting an enrollment of over 15,000 students, including in this 
list men in all ranks of business, from the lowest to the highest. 
CONCLUSION. 
In conclusion we ought to say something of the tendency to make a 
clear distinction between commercial education and industrial educa- 
tion. There has been a confusion of terms in this subject, due largely 
to the fact that manual training schools and commercial departments 
have been established in ordinary high schools. The work in Cin- 
cinnati and the work of the National Association of Corporation 
Schools have done much to make clear the distinction between these 
two lines of educational work. i 
We have made a survey of the work of boards of trade and cham- 
bers of commerce to discover what concise and well-directed support 
is given by these associations to educational institutions. There 
have been some sporadic attempts on the part of chambers of com- 
merce and boards of trade to give assistance, but very little has been 
done on the average. We are still far behind the various chambers 
of commerce in Europe in this respect. In its most recent report the 
London Chamber of Commerce says: 
But the London Chamber of Commerce has been bold enough to educate the edu- 
cators. Prior to 1886 there did not exist in this country any organized and specialized 
system for teaching youth destined to adopt a commercial career. The greatest com- 
mercial center in the world was doing nothing by way of education to correspond with 
what for years had been done in almost every competitive city on the Continent. 
The first step was a small one. In 1886 the textile trade section of the chamber 
initiated special classes, prizes, and certificates to encourage youths already engaged 
in the textile trades to render themselves efficient in modern foreign languages, in 
bookkeeping and in shorthand. This was followed by conferences with headmasters 
and educationists—a notable one being held at the Guildhall, under the presidency 
of Sir Albert K. Rollit, who was and is now the chairman of the commercial education 
committee—the appointment of a representative committee of pedagogues and public 
men, which in turn consulted with the Oxford and Cambridge examinations board, 
the College of Preceptors, the City and Guilds of London Institute, and others. A 
scheme for junior commercial education resulted, which was roundly condemned by 
many schoolmasters as calling for too high a standard, although falling below the level,
-P-A-G-E-302
248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
in its requirements, of the curricula common on the Continent. It would be too 
tedious a task to follow subsequent developments step by step, but in 1890 the chamber 
held its first examination for junior commercial certificates. Only 67 candidates pre- 
sented themselves, and only 17 secured a pass. Notwithstanding this meager result, 
all temptations to lower the standard of proficiency were resisted. In 1894 a senior 
commercial certificate examination was instituted, which attracted only 17 candidates, 
of whom 4 only were successful. Results fluctuated greatly for the next six years. 
With the introduction of examinations for junior commercial certificates in separate 
subjects in 1901, however, an extraordinary progressive movement set in. In 1910, 
107 full junior and 443 senior commercial certificates had been awarded; by 1904 the 
junior passes had risen to 1,350 and the senior to 1,198; whilst at the examinations held 
in the spring of 1910, 7,230 junior and 3,976 senior candidates presented themselves. 
When the movement started, commercial textbooks were rare—now they are plenti- 
ful—and there was no such encouragement as is new afforded by scholarships for pro- 
longing study in modern foreign languages. Last, but not least, there did not exist, 
as there do now, lists of employers and companies who are willing to give a preference 
in filling up vacancies in their establishments to holders of commercial certificates. 
This means that within the spheres of the 233 centers in which examinations are now 
held, the holders of the chamber’s certificates, numbering 34,572 to date, are privi- 
leged in obtaining employment. I opened my reference to this subject by stating 
that the chamber was bold enough to educate the educators. Classes in branches of 
commercial knowledge are now spread throughout the primary and secondary schools 
of the Kingdom, and the chamber examines for teacher’s diplomas, 985 having been 
awarded from 1905 to date. 
  Business men in the large cities are wide-awake to the oppor- 
tunities, and probably next year will be marked by fuller cooperation 
between business associations and local commercial educational 
institutions. 
Two important conventions were held during the year on the 
subject of commercial education, one under the auspices of the 
Efficiency Society in Boston, and the other under the auspices of the 
Western Economic Society. A complete account of the former con- 
vention will be found in volume 1 of the Transactions of the Efficiency 
Society, and of the latter in the Journal of Political Economy for 
January and February, 1913.

CHAPTER XI. 
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
By Wiutram T. Bawpen. 
Managing Editor of * Vocational Education.” 
ConTENTS.— Vocational education surveys—National society for the promotion of industrial education-— 
ional guidance—National education association—National association of corporation schools— 
Training of teachers for vocational education—Legislation—State systems of vocational educa- 
tion—Industrial education under State supervision in Pennsylvania. 
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION SURVEYS. 
One of the first things to be noted in a review of recent progress in 
vocational education in the United States is the gradual subsidence 
of the clamor for immediate action based on the experience of other 
countries, or for launching ambitious educational enterprises preceded 
by nothing but office study and paper preparation. The programs of 
educational conventions continue to give unmistakable evidence of 
the widespread interest in vocational education, but they are less 
and less cumbered with the details of schemes that have been 
developed to meet the special problems of some environment other 
than that in which the conferees are interested or with which they 
are acquainted. 
On the contrary, Commonwealths and communities in increasing 
numbers are turning their attention and their energies to self-study. 
Survey is rapidly usurping the place of efficiency as the most popular 
word of the hour, and in its turn bids fair to be associated with ex- 
cesses of various kinds in the characteristic American way. Never- 
theless an immense amount of good is accomplished in many places 
through this community study, and as a method of arriving at results 
it is so vastly superior to the plan of appropriating bodily a system 
that has been evolved to meet foreign conditions, that it is probably 
not too much to characterize it as the most significant phase of the 
vocational education movement during the past year. 
The importance of the survey as a factor in recent progress in 
vocational education may be suggested by noting briefly a few of 
those that have been undertaken or are projected. 
New Orleans.—An investigation has been undertaken by the depart- 
ment of educational research, recently created by the board of 
249
-P-A-G-E-304
Ne Tn eT Me OT SE eee eee te 
250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
education, for the purpose of developing plans for vocational educa- 
tion for that city. The immediate occasion for the study is an 
appropriation for this purpose of $2,000 from the funds made avail- 
able by the bequest of Isaac Delgado, who left $1,000,000 for founding 
a trade school for boys. Dr. David Spence Hill, of Tulane Uni- 
versity, is in charge of the investigation. The board of education 
has already established a trade school for girls, providing a new 
building at an expense of approximately $80,000. It is expected that 
the Delgado fund will provide $250,000 for buildings and equipment. 
New York City—The New York school inquiry, which has 
attracted attention all over the country, included in its scope some 
attention to the problems of vocational education. The constructive 
suggestions, if carried out, would greatly increase the opportunities 
for training available to children in that city. 
The New York City board of education has appointed a special 
committee to arrange with the permanent census board for an inves- 
tigation which will reveal the exact number of employed children in 
the city, and the nature and advantages of their occupations. 
Bridgeport, Conn.—During the past year an educational survey 
has been made by the board of education, under the direction of 
Supt. J. H. Van Sickle, of Springfield, Mass. The report includes. 
recommendations providing for a comprehensive scheme of industrial 
and household arts education suited to the needs of the community. 
Rochester, N. Y.—-The chamber of commerce and the board of 
education, in cooperation, have instituted a study of local industries, 
under the direction of George Keople, for the purpose of determining 
the lines along which further developments in vocational education 
shall take place. 
Buffalo, N. Y.—Plans are developing, and considerable field work 
has been actually done, looking toward a comprehensive industrial 
| education survey. It is to involve a careful study of the problem of 
vocational guidance, as well as that of vocational training. The 
| cooperating interests are the chamber of commerce, the board of 
| education, and the Young Men’s Christian Association. Numerous 
| conferences have been held, in consultation with E. W. Weaver, of 
| Brooklyn, N. Y., and others. 
| Duquesne, Pa.—The local Young Men’s Christian Association, 
| in cooperation with the central department, Pittsburgh, conducted 
| an investigation during the summer of 1913 for the purpose of de- 
veloping courses for workers and apprentices. 
| Cineinnati—The chamber of commerce has taken the initiative 
| in planning for a thorough educational and industrial investigation 
in that city. The United States Department of Labor has been   
requested to send a representative to counsel with the local authori- 
ties. The following agencies have been invited to cooperate: Board
-P-A-G-E-305
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 25h 
of education, Schmidlapp bureau, bureau of municipal research, and 
bureau of vocational guidance. The work is to be proseeuted under 
the direction of a general committee, which is to contain representa- 
tives of all of these interested organizations as well as representatives 
of employers and workingmen. 
Grand Rapids, Mich—As one of the practical outcomes of the 
eonvention of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial 
Education, a survey is making of the conditions of employment of 
women and girls in local industries. This study is under the direc- 
tion of Miss Cleo Murtland, assistant secretary of the society. 
Richmond, Va.—The board of education is planning an industriak 
education survey, to be carried out under the direction of Supt. 
J. A. ©. Chandler. 
Topeka, Kans—The board of education and the chamber of 
commerce are planning to cooperate im a survey of the industries of 
the city, under the direction of Supt. H. B. Wilson. 
St. Louis.—At the suggestion of Supt. Ben Blewett, the business 
men’s league is considering the advisability of an industrial and 
educational survey. 
New York City—The public education association, in cooperation 
with the board of education, has been conducting a thorough in- 
vestigation into the conditions of employment in the building trades 
in the city, under the direction of Miss Alice Barrows. Attention 
is given to the problems of both vocational guidance and vocational 
training. 
Boston.—One of the most complete studies that has yet been made 
in any city is that undertaken by the committee on opportunities 
for vocational training of the Women’s Municipal League. The plan 
included: (1) A series of maps showing the distribution of educa- 
tional agencies and resources; (2) a directory of these agencies for 
individual and community use, which should be kept constantly 
revised and up to date; (3) reports upon the character and scope of 
the work offered by these institutions; (4) constructive suggestions 
looking toward effective cooperation. The investigation resulted in 
the publication of a valuable “Handbook of Opportunities for 
Vocational Training in Boston.” 
Sioua City, Iowa.—The preliminary steps have been taken to secure 
the cooperation of as many interests as possible in an investigation 
to determine the educational needs of young people employed in the 
local industries. 
Minneapolis —A fund contributed by a citizen whose identity has 
not been made public is used to defray the expenses of a commission 
which is making a special study of vocational education in this 
country and Europe. The commission is made up of three members 
of the board of education and the assistant superintendent of 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
schools. It is expected that the commission will draw up plans for 
an adequate system of vocational. schools. 
NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
Through its board of managers and executive committee the 
National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education is con- 
tinuing to make itself felt as a positive force in the movement. It is 
without doubt a very strong factor in the progress of vocational 
education. By means of the publication and distribution of valuable 
bulletins, an extensive correspondence, and the personal efforts of 
representatives, it is conducting a propaganda of far-reaching 
influence. 
In ways that are not apparent to the casual observer the society 
has been of great usefulness in the preliminary shaping of legis- 
lation, and in the matter of counsel and suggestion in the numerous 
investigations, referred to elsewhere, that are now being conducted 
by‘communities in various parts of the United States. 
The society’s latest convention was held at Grand Rapids, Mich., 
in October, 1913. It was notable in at least three respects: First, 
for a new emphasis upon and a new impetus to the discussion of © 
the kinds of vocational training that should be provided for women 
and girls; second, it was the occasion of the distribution of three 
important bulletins; and, third, the program included a summary of 
the progressive work that is accomplished in a number of typical 
centers. 
VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. 
Two dominant notes characterized the program of the session 
devoted to this phase of the work; the first was the importance of 
the home and the need of specific training for its management, and 
the other was the dignity of labor and the need of the training of 
women and girls for efficiency in the industrial world. 
The discussion covered the entire field of housekeeping and the 
home, on the one side, taking in its relation to the commercial, 
industrial, economic, hygienic, educational, moral, and ethical de- 
partments of life, Housekeeping was presented as a big, vital, 
progressive enterprise, requiring as much skill in the administration 
of its affairs as a manufacturing plant or a business undertaking. On 
the other side, there was a very comprehensive treatment of plans 
for women’s work in preparation for self-supporting occupation in 
industry and the home:

SPECIAL SECRETARY FOR WOMEN’S WORK. 
Much enthusiasm was manifested at the first public appearance of 
a secretary whose special interest is to be the development of work 
for women and girls. More than a year ago the board of managers 
of the society created a committee whose duty it was'to devise ways 
and means to further the interests of women and girls in this field, 
and thus to round out and complete the work of the society, which 
hitherto had been giving attention more particularly to the problems 
of vocational training for boys. This committee held several im- 
portant and protracted conferences at the time of the Philadelphia 
convention in 1912, and presented to the board of managers a plan 
and recommendations calling for the appointment of a secretary 
who should give her entire time to these questions. 
The executive committee, in its report to the board of managers, 
February 8, 1913, recommended the appointment of an assistant 
secretary ‘‘to make a special study of vocational training for women 
who are wishing to prepare for self-support and women who are 
already self-supporting, and to carry out the plans of a committee 
on women’s work.” The creation of a committee was also recom- 
mended, as well as steps to secure adequate representation of women 
on the board of managers. The recommendations were adopted, 
and a committee of nine members was appointed under the chair- 
manship of Miss Virginia Potter, former president of the board of 
managers that organized the Manhattan Trade School for Girls, 
New York, and maintained it for seven years before it became a part 
of the public-school system of the city. 
THE SHORT, UNIT COURSE, 
The first of the three bulletins distributed at the Grand Rapids 
convention is one entitled ‘‘ The Short Unit Course for Evening Trade 
Extension and Part-Time Trade Extension Schools.” It is a pam- 
phlet of 116 pages issued as Bulletin No. 17, consisting of three 
parts: I. Organization and administration of the short unit course; 
II. List of courses; III. Analysis of courses. 
The bulletin was made the basis of the discussion on the topic: 
“How can the evening school best meet the needs of the wage 
worker?’’ The idea of the short unit course is by no means a recent 
discovery, as is indicated by the rather imposing list of teachers and 
directors upon whom the authors were able to draw in the compilation 
of this report. Nevertheless, the report is one of the most significant 
contributions of the past year in its analysis of the problems of the 
evening school and the adaptation of means to ends.

254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
THE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS. 
Probably the most significant event of the Grand Rapids conven- 
tion was the presentation on Saturday morning of the preliminary 
report of the “Committee on the selection and training of teachers 
for State-aided industrial schools for boys and men.” The report 
is in the form of an 86-page bulletin. The following features attract 
attention: 
The sole object of certification is to insure a wise selection of teachers for the service 
of the State. The present practice of selecting teachers by means of the written 
examination does not adequately measure the qualifications which vocational schools 
are demanding of their teachers. Methods involving more practical tests must be 
devised to supplement the written examination. Such tests should include creden- 
tials of various kinds'as to trade ability and technical knowledge, supplemented by 
personal interviews and practical demonstrations. Examinations should be in the 
hands of the State, working in close cooperation with the local community. Cer- 
tificates should be-issued by the State and should be valid for one year, to be renewed 
only when the teacher is able to demonstrate his ability to teach his chosen subject 
efficiently. 
The power of certification should lie with the State board of educational control 
as’ a. part. of its responsibility in the supervision: of State-aided schools. The work 
of examination and certification should be conducted by the special committee to 
which the control of vocational schools is committed. Such examinations require 
entirely new machinery or radical modification of present machinery. 
There is an increasing demand for vocational teachers. Existing institutions do not 
adequately train teachers for industrial work. Vocational teachers must have expe- 
rience im the trades they teach. Colleges and normal schools can not give adequate 
trade training. Trade experience must be obtained by working in the trade before 
entering the training school. To give training for vocational teaching, new schemes 
are necessary. 
Special evening training classes designed to deal with the problems of the industrial 
school and the application of the principles of teaching to such a school, limited in 
their membership to selected men in the trade and directed by men experienced in 
industrial school work, give promise of being the best source of immediate supply. 
The intermediate technical school is one source to which we may look for teachers. 
Such schools should establish adequate training courses designed to train the student 
who has trade experience in the art. of teaching his trade. Where normal schools 
attempt to train vocational teachers, special departments should be established for 
the purpose. Tradesmen will not forego earning power to take such training. As 
an aid to this work, scholarships should be granted by the State. Training classes in 
the various industrial and trade schools maintained by the State and taught by a 
traveling instructor especially equipped for the work offer a feasible plan. In every 
case, training in teaching and trade contact should continue after the teacher gains 
employment, through special training classes, and renewal of certificates to teach in 
State-aided schools should depend in part upon participation in such training., 
CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The third of the three bulletins to be distributed at the Grand 
Rapids convention is entitled, “What chambers of commerce can do 
for vocational education.” Following is an outline of the definite 
suggestions presented in the 54-page pamphlet:
-P-A-G-E-309
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 255 
The following steps may be taken to further local effort in promoting vocational 
education: 
(1) Establish a committee on vocational education as a part of the chamber of 
commerce organization; (2) arrange meetings to stir up local interest in vocational 
education; (3) preparation and publication of statements showing in detail the facili- 
ties for industrial and commercial education in the locality; (4) initiation and support 
of investigations as to the need of vocational schools; (5) aid in establishing advisory 
committees of business men; (6) aid in providing scholarships and rewards for further 
industrial or commercial work and experience outside of the schools; (7) establish a 
placement bureau for vocational school pupils; (8) interest young people in vocational 
efliciency through the formation of a younger division of the chamber of commerce. 
The following ways are suggested of furthering State effort in promoting vocational 
education: (1) Keep track of proposed legislation; (2) conferences with various 
organizations that may or should be interested in vocational education; (3) obtain the 
establishment of a commission to study problems of vocational education as applied 
to the State; (4) urge the passage of laws making possible a State system of vocational 
education. 
The bulletin also contains a summary of what chambers of com- 
merce have done and are now doing for vocational education in 
different parts of the United States in the direction of influencing 
legislation, raising funds, supporting educational surveys, etc. 
RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS IN TYPICAL CENTERS. 
The third very real contribution of the national society consists in 
focusing attention at its annual conventions upon actual achieve- 
ments, thus making the experience of one center available over as 
wide an area as possible. Reference may be made here to two of 
the addresses presented at Grand Rapids. 
The problems of the development of schemes for industrial educa- 
tion in the small city were very well brought out in one of the dis- 
cussions. While in certain respects these problems are easier to 
handle in the small city, there are certain difficulties that are due 
to the very fact of the limitations of size. Ina city as large as Detroit, 
for example, after some months of planning and effort, there has been 
developed a scheme of part-time education involving the coopera- 
tion of about 20 manufacturers. At that rate Kalamazoo might 
expect to be able to enlist the cooperation of two concerns. It can be 
readily seen that, under such conditions, it would not be easy to bring 
together in the smaller city prospective pupils in large enough groups 
to secure anything like the maximum of efficiency. 
On the other hand, there are many problems encountered in the 
large city that do not arise in the small one. The results of the 
Chicago experiments are especially suggestive to other cities because 
of the working agreements which have been brought about between 
the labor unions and employers in the effort to solve the problem of 
apprentice training. One illustration must suffice: 
After experimenting with evening classes for two seasons, and 
demonstrating that that plan can not fully meet the situation, plans 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  256 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
were developed through conferences for the organization of day 
classes designed to provide the kinds of instruction needed by appren- 
tices in certain selected occupations. In September, 1912, for exam- 
ple, an agreement was effected between the union and the officers of 
the Electrical Contractors’ Association, whereby the union passed 
an order requiring the attendance of all apprentices at the day classes 
provided for one-half day of each week, while the employers agree 
that apprentices should be paid for the time spent in school at their 
regular rate of pay, provided that this amount did not exceed $1. 
Following is the agreement ratified by the union and by the Electrical 
Contractors’ Association: 
It shall be compulsory upon apprentices to attend school at least one-half day each 
week during the school term, and the employer will pay apprentice for such time up 
to $1 per week. The union shall furnish the apprentices with necessary textbooks 
free of charge, and shall also provide each apprentice with a card which must be pre- 
sented to the instructor at the school and signed by him each week, to show that 
apprentice was in attendance; and this must be shown by the apprentice to the fore- 
man or employer on request. 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE. 
No discussion of progress in vocational education would be com- 
plete without consideration of the intimately related subject of 
vocational guidance. In this field of effort events have moved more 
swiftly, if that be possible, than in industrial education. A short 
time ago it could hardly be said that there was any such thing as 
vocational guidance as a conscious social aim. At least, it did not 
exist in any organized and efficient form. To-day, however, voca- 
tional education and vocational guidance are rapidly coming to be 
recognized as two phases of one vast problem. 
The present status of the movement may, perhaps, be briefly 
summarized as follows: Not-so very long ago vocational guidance 
meant finding a job for the individual in some industry, and it was 
regarded as a comparatively simple matter. 
As men and women have studied these problems, however, they 
have discovered that here is an immense field, challenging the most 
thorough investigation, and offering almost unlimited opportunities 
for the application of scientific method and skill. The effort. to find 
employment for boys and girls has been largely transformed into an 
effort to keep the boys and girls out of the industries, by convincing 
them and their parents of the value of further schooling, at least until 
there is available a fund of more definite knowledge of the industries 
into which it is proposed to send the children. 
There are several distinct problems recognized in this general field 
of vocational guidance: (1) There are still those who believe the 
problem to be one mainly of guiding individual boys and girls into
-P-A-G-E-311
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 257 
suitable employment. (2) There are those who believe that, in the 
present state of general ignorance, those most in need of vocational 
guidance are the teachers and parents, who are themselves supposed 
to be the sources of advice. (8) There can be no doubt that the 
industries need to be carefully and systematically studied, to the end 
that vocational counselors may know as accurately and fully as pos- 
sible the conditions into which they send the boys and girls. It is 
believed that many industries must be greatly modified before any 
organized agency can assume responsibility for the employment of 
children in them. (4) Many believe that employers, as a class, are 
as much in need of vocational enlightenment as any of the others 
involved. (5) Finally, there are those to whom vocational guidance 
means the impartial distribution of advice and suggestion to children, 
parents, teachers, employers, and the industries. 
The Grand Rapids convention contributed an important step 
forward in perfecting the organization of the National Vocational 
Guidance Association. A meeting for this purpose was held during 
the three days immediately preceding the convention of the National 
Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education. 
A practical object lesson that proved to be of great constructive 
assistance to the delegates present was afforded by a conference on 
vocational guidance, held in the auditorium of the Central High 
School, followed by an organized inspection of the work in vocational 
guidance in this school and in the junior high school. The topics on 
the program, presented by high-school pupils, included: ‘The work 
of the junior association of commerce,” ‘‘Student activities and 
social efficiency,’ and ‘‘Training for leadership.” The subjects for 
discussion in the classes visited included: ‘‘Vocational ambition,” 
“The value of education,’ ‘‘Study of vocations,” ‘Vocational 
biography,” ‘‘Choosing a vocation,” ‘‘Preparation for vocation,” 
“Vocational ethics,” ete. 
The present trend of vocational guidance was summarized from 
another point of view by one of the speakers on the convention pro- 
gram as follows: (1) The work began originally with the attention 
given to various types of misfits in the social settlements. It was 
based on what might be characterized as a “niche” theory of society, 
which states the problem as that of finding the particular place or 
station in life that exists somewhere for each individual. (2) In the 
second stage it was held to be the duty of society vo tinker with, and 
in some way to patch up, individuals that are defective. (8) The idea 
was conceived of working through the public schools to prevent indi- 
viduals from being spoiled in the making. (4) Next came a shift in 
emphasis to the necessity of vocational training. (5) And finally we 
have come to a recognition of the necessity for an educational survey 
17726° —xp 1913—vor 1——17   
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  258 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
of the community in order to determine and to make known the 
facilities and opportunities that are already available, and for a survey 
of the industries in order to determine what the real needs are. The 
present tendency undoubtedly is to seek to utilize the public school 
system as the agency for the prosecution of the work, looking toward 
the solution of these great problems. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
For several years past the National Education Association has mani- 
fested a lively interest in the problems of vocational education, as 
may be seen from the amount of space in its programs devoted to the 
discussion of related topics and from the number of committees which 
have been at work under the direction of various departments. The 
importance of these problems was recognized in a more definite and 
official way at the Chicago meeting, July, 1912, by the appointment 
of a committee on vocational education and vocational guidance, with 
a preliminary appropriation of $500. The chairman of this committee 
is Robert J. Fuller, superintendent of public schools, North Attleboro, 
Mass. 
A preliminary report in the form of a 32-page pamphlet was pre- 
sented at the 1913 convention in Salt Lake City, which contained 
suggestions as to the field to be covered by the work of the commit- 
tee, a series of questions and issues to be discussed, and an outline 
indicating the scope and possibilities of the work involved in any 
comprehensive study of the questions of vocational education and 
vocational guidance for persons between the ages of 14 and 18 years. 
It is proposed that the final report shall take the form of a hand- 
book of information for the use of those who are interested in adopt- 
ing some plan of vocational education and vocational guidance; that 
it shall contain also a discussion and presentation of plans for the cer- 
tification and training of teachers for vocational education; that it 
shall include an acceptance of principles and policies already pre- 
pared upon vocational education and vocational guidance, together 
with a statement of such additional principles and policies as new 
conditions and needs may demand; and that it shall add warnings, 
as well as constructive suggestions, concerning what needs to be done 
and what needs to be avoided to make the work successful in any given 
community. 
A subcommittee was created, under the chairmanship of Meyer 
Bloomfield, secretary of the Boston Vocational Bureau, to make a 
special study of the problems of vocational guidance. This sub- 
committee is to prepare a report which will become a part of the 
report made to the association by the general committee.
-P-A-G-E-313
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 259 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATION SCHOOLS. 
Another important factor in the progress of the movement is the 
National Association of Corporation Schools, which held its first 
annual convention at Dayton, Ohio, in September, 1913. A large 
attendance, a vigorous executive committee, an aggressive policy, 
and a four days’ program crowded with live discussions, attest the 
high hopes for vocational education as one means of contributing to 
the amelioration of conditions and to the solution of certain perplex- 
ing social problems. The avowed purpose of this organization is to 
provide a means for the interchange of ideas and experience, and 
through this interchange to prevent, if possible, costly mistakes in 
the planning and administration of new schools. 
The demand for skilled labor is becoming more insistent every day. 
In attempting to meet that demand employers of labor have them- 
selves established apprenticeship schools and cooperative courses, the 
latter arranged in connection with schools of general education. 
From the manufacturing and trade point of view the apprenticeship 
school is almost ideal, but such schools are as a rule possible only 
for concerns operating on a large scale. It is possible that one of 
these two forms of vocational education will prove to be that ideal 
form which the public is seeking—the form which shall conserve the 
best interests of each individual and of all classes of people. 
Although the much-lamented old-time apprenticeship system, by 
which an apprentice learned a trade from top to bottom in a com- 
paratively small shop, has become a thing of the past, apprenticeship 
has never entirely died out. It has become almost a dead letter in 
many occupations, however, since apprentices in actual practice, if 
not in theory, have been restricted to work involving only one or two 
operations for long periods instead of learning a trade as a whole. 
This condition has been due, of course, to the rapid development of 
industry in an era of specialization. Now manufacturers are finding 
that the young men of the new generation are not prepared for 
advancement in their trade, and are not prepared to become foremen. 
They are therefore considering the necessity of changing their policy 
of extreme specialization, and are beginning to revise their appren- 
ticeship system so that the apprentice may receive a complete trade 
training, and with it such academic instruction as will further his 
advancement and, in addition, promote higher ideals of citizenship. 
In planning systems of instruction it has been found that evening 
continuation classes, while practicable for the older men, are not advis- 
able for the younger employees from the health standpoint. For 
them day schools are looked upon as the best solution. The appren- 
ticeship schools differ in time allowances, in supervision and methods 
of instruction, in subject matter, and in compensation for class time.

  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
THE BROWN & SHARPE SCHOOL, PROVIDENCE, 
The vocational school maintained by the Browne & Sharpe Manu- 
facturing Company, Providence, R. I., may be considered as typical of 
the plans which are developed by the companies which make up the 
membership of the National Association of Corporation Schools. This 
concern has had an apprenticeship system in its shops for over 50 
years, and considers it “one of the very corner stones on which its 
prosperity and permanence rest.’”’ The aim of this apprenticeship 
system, with its school of instruction, is to make skilled machinists, 
and while the course fits also for foremanships and other lines of 
advancement, the company feels that the greatest need of to-day is 
for skilled workmen, and that any course of instruction leading away 
from supplying this need is not rightly directed. Many officials of the 
company, however, have risen from the ranks of the apprentices. It 
is stated that in 1904 there were 40 officials of the company who had 
begun as apprentices. 
A foreman, or supervisor, of apprentices gives the school instruction 
and assists the shop foremen in giving the shop practice. In addition, 
he looks after the general welfare of the boys in a very intimate and 
personal way. He keeps in touch with the apprentices outside of 
working hours, and takes an interest in their social and moral life. 
Lectures, clubs, evening classes, and social features are arranged for 
their benefit. 
The company’s requirements of candidates for apprenticeship are 
higher than those which prevail in some other establishments. The 
boys must be grammar-school graduates, and must be at least 16 
years of age. They must pay $50 to the company at the beginning 
of their period of apprenticeship for the privilege of learning the trade. 
At the close of the period, however, in consideration of faithful 
service, the apprentices receive a cash bonus of $150 each. 
The apprenticeship school has been in operation for five years. The 
150 apprentices in attendance are divided into groups of 18 for class 
work. The instruction is conducted mainly without textbooks and by 
direct means, working from the particular problem and its solution 
up to the principle. Practical problems are taken up as they would 
occur in the shop. Such reference books and tables are at hand as 
any progressive mechanic should have, and the students are taught to 
use them in solving the problems. These problems are worked out in 
blue-print form, and the sheets are preserved by the boys in suitable 
covers. At the close of the course this collection of sheets forms a 
valuable reference book for future use. The blue prints follow a 
careful gradation in the difficulty of the problems, and the directions 
given are explicit.

OTHER CORPORATION SCHOOLS. 
There are a number of other important schools that ought to receive 
attention under this heading, but lack of space forbids more than the 
briefest mention. One of the pioneers in this field is the firm of R. 
Hoe & Co., New York, manufacturers of printing presses and machin- 
ery, which has had a school for apprentices in continuous operation for 
over 40 years. The apprenticeship school of the Lakeside Press, 
Chicago, and the course of instruction maintained by the Interna- 
tional Typographical Union, with headquarters at Chicago, are types 
of progressive schools in this industry. In the field of electricity 
there are schools in connection with the plants of the General Electric 
Co., the Western Electric Co., the Westinghouse interests, and others. 
The International Harvester Co., the Fore River Shipbuilding Co., the 
American Locomotive Co., the Cadillac Motor Car Co., the Pennsyl- 
vania Railroad system, are instances selected to indicate the wide 
range of the industries that are drawn into the movement in a vital 
way. 
’ TRAINING OF TEACHERS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
One of the chief obstacles in the way of the rapid development of 
vocational education at the present time is the total inadequacy of 
the supply of teachers having the necessary training and qualifica- 
tions. This lack of teachers has been apparent for some time, and; 
indeed, it was foreseen and predicted long before it manifested itself, 
but the efforts to prepare to meet it have not thus far developed on 
a scale large enough to exert much influence on the situation. The 
unusual combination of expert knowledge of the craft and teaching 
skill is not easy to secure. The traditional salaries assumed to be 
ample compensation for the school-teacher do not offer any induce- 
ment to the high-grade mechanic, who can hardly be expected to 
undergo a period of special training and preparation in order to enter 
as a missionary upon a field of work at a lower wage than he can earn 
in the shop. Theré are indications, however, that the necessary 
readjustment in salaries is already under way. The example already 
set by numerous boards of education, in determining to pay whatever 
is necessary in order to insure fully qualified leadership, will exert 
more real influence than hours of discussion and many pages of 
theorizing. 
In response to these evidences of the demand already existing for 
properly qualified teachers at a fair remuneration, a number of insti- 
tutions have organized special classes for the accommodation of men 
who are regularly employed at the trades which it is proposed to 
train them to teach. By holding these classes in the evenings, it is 
possible for the men to avail themselves of the training without sacri- 
ficing their status as wage earners; and by arranging for a limited
-P-A-G-E-316
  262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
amount of practice teaching in the same way, it is possible to facili- 
tate the transition from the shop position to the school position, and 
to arrange for the elimination without violence or shock of those who 
are manifestly unfitted for the work of teaching. 
During the past year special classes of the kind referred to have 
been organized in the following institutions: Teachers College, Colum- 
bia University, New York; Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, N. Y.; State 
Normal College, Albany, N. Y.; State Normal School, Buffalo, N. Y., 
and others. <A brief account of the work at Albany must suffice as 
an illustration of the methods employed in these classes. 
For two years this school had received calls for men trained to 
teach specific trades. A one-year course had been maintained for 
this purpose, but only one man each year had availed himself of the 
opportunity. In the light of this experience it was determined to 
establish a night school to care for the demand. The number was 
limited to 15 men and to four trades: Patternmakers, cabinetmakers 
or carpenters, machinists, and general metal workers. Not less than 
five years’ experience at the trade, in addition to apprenticeship, was 
required of candidates for admission to the training course. <A full 
number for the class was soon selected from a large number of appli- 
cants, each after a personal interview with the director of the work, 
after having been recommended by the superintendents or managers 
of the various shops interested. The members of the class proved 
to be of a rather superior class of shop men, with an average trade 
experience of 12 years. 
The class met on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, from 7 to 9.30, 
the term being 40 weeks in length. The work was divided into four 
subjects: Shopwork, drawing, shop mathematics, and the principles 
of teaching. In the shopwork the only general information given in 
the trades was in the direction of some special classes of work which 
the men had not been able to get in their trade experience. For 
example, a machinist may have worked many years in a shop and 
never have used a milling machine. Such a man was put on the 
milling machine and thoroughly taught its principles and uses. 
The main object of the shopwork was to show the men by example 
how to treat students in a trade school. The men assumed the atti- 
tude of green apprentices, and the instructors presented the work by 
the same methods that would be used with classes of boys. In general 
the idea was to create for the men the atmosphere of a trade school, 
with their own skill as a background on which to work, and in this 
way to allow them to absorb, as far as possible, the spirit of a good 
teacher. 
The only academic work introduced was that in the principles of 
teaching. In this course were discussed the necessity for careful 
outlines, the principles of laying out work, courses of study, equip-
-P-A-G-E-317
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 263 
ment, the correlation between the different parts of a school, prices 
of materials, class recitations and examinations, records and effi- 
ciency cards, and other practical details of the teacher’s work. No 
attempt was made to go deeply into the philosophy of the subject, 
only such facts being studied as are necessary for any man who 
expects to impart information. 
LEGISLATION. 
The subject of legislation for vocational education for the current 
year was fully treated in the last report in the form of a forecast.! 
In Washington, D. C., in connection with the so-called Page bill and 
Lever bill passed by the Senate and House, respectively, and in the 
Illinois State Legislature, the situation resulted in a deadlock, chiefly 
because of the inability of the zealous friends of vocational education 
to agree on the fundamental principles that should be embodied in 
the laws. With these exceptions, practically all of the legislation 
referred to was subsequently enacted, and as the proposed laws have 
been outlined in detail with respect to their main provisions, they 
are not repeated here. 
California.—A State board of education has been established and 
authorized to appoint three deputies to assist the State superin- 
tendent. One of these deputies is to have charge of industrial and 
household arts education. The law does not provide for State aid for 
vocational education. 
Connecticut.—The act of 1909, establishing a system of State trade 
schools, has been modified so as to provide State aid up to a limit of 
$10,000 for vocational schools organized and maintained under local 
initiative. A trade school at New Haven has already been organized 
under the provisions of the new law. 
STATE SYSTEMS OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
Six States now have in operation definite systems for organizing 
and supervising vocational schools and for assisting local communities 
in the maintenance of such schools through grants of State aid. 
Specific machinery for the administration of these systems has been 
established, in each case under the direction of a special deputy, or 
expert assistant, attached to the staff of the State superintendent or 
commissioner of education. These States are Massachusetts, New 
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Indiana. 
The following summary, based on reports received from the offices 
of the State departments of public instruction, is a brief review of the 
progress that has been made during the past year in the administra- 
tion of State aid for vocational education.

282-287.
-P-A-G-E-318
  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
New legislation.—Continuation-school law, chapter 805 of the acts 
of 1913. 
The salient features of this law are: This act is permissive; commu- 
nities may establish these schools, but are not required to do so. 
Schools are for minors between 14 and 16 years of age who are regu- 
larly employed not less than six hours per day. With the consent of 
the State board of education school committees may require attend- 
ance in these schools of all minors securing employment certificates 
who are not otherwise receiving instruction approved by them as 
equivalent to that provided in the continuation schools established. 
Attendance at these schools shall be at the rate of not less than 
four hours per week and shall be between the hours of 8 o’clock in the 
morning and 6 o’clock in the afternoon of any working day. The 
time spent in the continuation school or class shall be reckoned as a 
part of the number of hours that minors are permitted by law to work. 
So long as continuation schools are approved by the State board of 
education the municipalities maintaining them shall be reimbursed 
to the extent of one-half the cost of maintaining them. 
. Employers of minors of the group affected are required to permit 
attendance upon and may not employ minors who do not attend these 
schools. A penalty is attached to violation of this requirement. 
Chapter 779, acts of 1913, requires children 14 to 16 years of age to 
be either in school or at work. It is in this respect supplementary to 
chapter 805. 
Chapter 832, acts of 1913, places teachers in State-aided vocational 
schools in list of teachers who may avail themselves of the State 
pension law for teachers. 
By chapters 566 and 587 of the acts of 1912 two county agricultural 
schools were established, one in Essex County, at Danvers, and the 
other in Bristol County, at Segreganset. 
New appointment.—Robert Orange Small was appointed deputy 
commissioner of education in charge of vocational education, August 
1, 1913. : 
New work.—The greatest development of the year in new work has 
been that of the evening courses in practical arts and homemaking for 
women authorized under chapter 106 of the asts of 1912. During the 
past year courses have been opened in this work in 17 cities and towns 
in over 40 centers. 
Tn the classes in day schools for instruction of girls in home making, 
cooperative work between the home and the school, in which the 
practical home work has been definitely correlated with the school, 
has been a feature developed to some extent.
-P-A-G-E-319
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 265 
The short unit’course, designed to serve the specific needs of a small 
group of skilled workers and limited to a period of 5 to 10 weeks, has 
been a feature in the trade extension work of the evening schools. 
At Hyannis during the first week of July, 1913, there was held a 
summer institute organized and conducted by the agent in charge of 
vocational work for men and boys, with the cooperation of committees 
from the principals and teachers. This institute was for the benefit 
of teachers employed in the State-aided vocational schools and was 
attended by 150 persons. It was a very profitable affair and will be 
continued as an annual institute. 
The whole trend of industrial schools in this State is toward more 
definite and direct vocational education. The measure of the success 
of the schools is their ability to train for skilled industries and for 
citizenship. 
NEW YORK. 
The progress of vocational education in the State of New York dur- 
ing the past year has demonstrated that vocational instruction is not 
only a question of establishing a new branch in the old-school system, 
but it involves the whole purpose of our public-school system. The 
demand of the hour is no longer solely that the children shall be 
taught craftsmanship, but that the entire theory and practice of 
public education shall be overhauled with a view of fitting it to the 
needs of the democracy. 
New legislation.—During the past year New York amended its edu- 
cation law to provide for State-aided evening vocational schools, and 
part-time or continuation schools, as well as to extend the amount of 
aid given to vocational instruction. The agitation for this increased 
aid was based upon the proposition that the need for vocational 
instruction within the State was great and imminent, that in view of 
the expense involved and the problems to be solved State support 
and cooperation were necessary. Furthermore, in view of the issues 
at stake and difficulties to be encountered, allotments of State money 
should be made under conditions which prevent it being wasted or 
misapplied and yet guarantee local rather than State control and 
administration. : 
Bulletin.—An important bulletin was issued dealing with the rules 
and regulations of the commissioner of education with reference to 
certain fundamental principles which must underlie the establishment 
and operation of State-aided vocational education. The spirit and 
purpose behind these definite plans and policies were based upon the 
theory that the local community and the State had entered into a 
joint partnership for the purpose of securing an effective scheme for 
vocational training such as would justify State aid under the law.  
-P-A-G-E-320
    
266 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
It has been determined that in order to give State aid to part-time 
continuation schools, the pupils must be regularly and lawfully em- 
ployed during part of the day in useful employment or service, and 
the subject taught must be supplementary to the practical work 
earried on in such employment or service. 
In the case of evening vocational schools, it has been determined that 
State-aided vocational instruction shall include that which is given 
in the trades and in industrial, agricultural, and home-making sub- 
jects which are open to pupils over 16 years of age who are regularly 
and lawfully employed during the day, the said instruction to be in 
subjects related to the practical work carried on in such employment. 
However, such evening vocational school providing instruction in 
home making shall be open to all women over 16 years of age who 
are employed in any capacity during the day. The State has drawn 
a sharp distinction between the general evening school supported 
entirely by the local community and the State-aided evening voca- 
tional school supported jointly by the community and the State. 
The year has been marked by actual developments, not only by new 
types of instruction, but by increased efficiency in all types of voca- 
tional instruction. The beginning has been made in placing on a 
firmer foundation the selection and training of teachers for State- 
aided vocational schools. Pratt Institute has established a course for 
training, through evening instruction, mechanics who are employed 
during the day, fitting them for the special demands of vocational 
schools. The State Normal College at Albany, and the Buffalo Nor- 
mal School have evening courses fitting employed men to become 
teachers. The idea of giving short unit courses in evening trade 
extension and part-time trade extension schools, in place of the more 
general industrial work as formerly conducted by these schools, has 
made great progress. 
Trade cooperation.—An interesting agreement has been drawn up 
between the Rochester Typothete and the Rochester Shop School 
whereby the term of apprenticeship in the printing trade shall be 
four years. Three months shall consist of a preliminary or try-out 
course at the public printing school, and upon completing this pre- 
liminary course the pupil may enter the employ of some printing plant 
as an apprentice. The apprentice shall alternate weekly between 
the shop school and the printing plant and receive from the employer 
a weekly wage, the employer to pay wages for the school time as well 
as the shop time 
NEW JERSEY. 
Legislation.—The legislature of 1913 passed a law known as the 
vocational school law, which provides State aid for districts setting up 
vocational schools or departments in (1) industrial, (2) agricultural,
-P-A-G-E-321
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 267 
or (3) household arts education. These schools may be all-day, part- 
time, or continuation schools, or evening schools. The amount of 
State aid given may be a maximum of $10,000 for each school. Under 
the provisions of this law vocational schools have already been estab- 
lished in Newark, Jersey City, Bayonne, Passaic, and Atlantic City. 
There are now in operation in New Jersey the following types of indus- 
trial schools organized under this law: 
(1) All-day industrial schools for boys over 14. 
(2) All-day household arts schools for girls over 14. 
(3) Part-time or continuation day schools for boys over 14, regu- 
larly employed as apprentices. 
(4) Evening industrial classes for boys or girls over 16, employed 
as apprentices. 
(5) Evening household arts classes for girls over 17. 
(6) Short unit courses. These courses offer in a few lessons in- 
struction to workers who wish some specific help. For ex- 
ample, Passaic is offering several short unit courses for 
textile workers. One of these is a course in textile calcula- 
tions in cloth analysis, and is given for a period of six nights. 
Appointment.—The general school law of New Jersey provides that 
four assistant commissioners of education shall be appointed, one of 
whom shall have charge of vocational education, including agricul- 
ture. In January, 1913, Dr. Calvin N. Kendall, commissioner of 
education, appointed Lewis H. Carris to have charge of the industrial 
department. ; 
Bulletin —The State department of public instruction has issued 
two bulletins during the year. Bulletin No. 1, State-Aided Vocational 
Schools, gives a brief description of how these schools can be organized, 
the kinds of schools possible, the classifications of teachers, and the 
text of the law. Bulletin No. 2, The Short Unit Course, is a reprint 
of a bulletin of similar title recently issued by the National Society 
for the Promotion of Industrial Education. 
The fact that New Jersey has had State aid for manual training 
for so many years, and that any district may receive State aid to the 
amount of $5,000 in the introduction and maintenance of any form 
of manual training, has brought about in many places work under 
this designation which approximates vocational education. The 
amount of State aid given to manual training during the past school 
year was $190,000. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Legislation —The general assembly in May, 1913, passed a voca- 
tional education law. Prior to this time no provisions had been 
made for vocational education, except in a very general way by the 
school code of 1911, and no money had been appropriated to aid the 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
    
268 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
districts maintaining vocational schools. The act of 1913 set up a 
definite State system of vocational education which is fundamentally 
the same as the New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Massachusetts 
systems. 
The general assembly also appropriated $140,000 to assist the 
various districts which would establish and maintain vocational 
schools. This money was divided as follows: $52,000 for agricul- 
tural education, $50,000 for industrial education, $18,000 for house- 
hold arts, and $15,000 for the part payment of the tuition of pupils 
in vocational schools maintained by districts other than their own. 
The State board of education is charged with administering this 
act, and the State superintendent of public instruction is made the 
executive official of the State board. 
Bulletins. —Bulletins have been prepared by the vocational division 
of the department of public instruction covering ‘‘Vocational educa- 
tion in Pennsylvania,’ ‘‘Agricultural schools and departments,” 
“Evening industrial classes,” and ‘‘Household arts schools and 
departments.’ These bulletins are issued with the purpose of setting 
forth the plan of organization and conditions which must be met by 
the various schools in order to receive State aid. 
Evening industrial schools for machinists, carpenters, bricklayers, 
plumbers, mine workers, electricians, tinsmiths, and printers are 
maintained in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Williamsport, Wilkes-Barre, 
Nanticoke, Wamanie, Shamokin, Ellsworth, and Cokesburg. The 
mine industry, although one of the greatest industries in the State 
of Pennsylvania, has in the past received little or no attention in the 
way of adapting the schools to its particular needs. Last year schools 
for mine workers were very successfully maintained in Nanticoke, 
Wamanie, Glenlyon, and Shamokin. The success attending these 
schools is shown by the fact that from the Nanticoke and Glenlyon 
schools 28 men took the State examination for assistant mine fore- 
man’s certificate, 24 of whom passed; 6 took the examination for 
mine foreman’s certificate, 4 of whom passed. From the Mount 
Carmel and Shamokin schools, 2 men passed the examination for 
mine foreman’s certificate, and_6 men received the assistant mine 
foreman’s certificate. At Ellsworth 3 men took the examination 
and passed for assistant mine foreman’s certificate. In the Nanti- 
coke and Glenlyon districts there was a total enrollment of 657 for 
1912-13, an increase of 529 over the previous year. The average 
attendance for the year 1912 was 30 per cent. The Mount Carmel 
and Shamokin districts had an enrollment of 763, with an average 
attendance of 34 per cent. Mount Carmel conducted a class for non- 
English speaking adults, which was a great success. 
The above-mentioned cities have opened mining schools for the 
year 1913-14. Nesquehoning and Shickshinny, Lykens, Wisconisco,
-P-A-G-E-323
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 269 
and Williamstown have organized evening industrial schools for 
miners. Wilkes-Barre has organized an evening school for machin- 
ists. Williamsport, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh are conducting 
evening industrial classes. The teachers for the evening industrial 
schools are recruited from the ranks of the men employed in the 
industries. So far it has been possible to secure men with anywhere 
from 6 to 21 years’ experience. It is true they lack the teaching 
experience, yet with organized lessons in their hands they are doing 
remarkably well at the present time. 
Rural schools—Several experiments have been conducted in 
connection with rural schools, and an attempt has been made to 
make the work more practical, so as to meet the needs of the com- 
munity. While this work is not vocational when interpreted in 
terms of the law, yet it approximates that type of work as closely 
as any that can be given in such schools. The work consists mainly 
in construction of potato crates, repairing harness, and various other 
activities connected with rural life. 
WISCONSIN. 
In June, 1911, Wisconsin passed the law providing for industrial 
and continuation schools. During the year 1911-12 two schools 
were established and maintained, one at Racine and one at Manitowoc. 
The law provides for a State board of industrial education composed 
of nine members, and for each city of 5,000 inhabitants an industrial 
board of five members appointed by the regular board of education. 
The State reimburses each city one-half of its expenditures in main- 
taining these schools. 
Schools—There are four classes of schools: (1) For apprentices; 
(2) for persons over 14 and under 16 employed for wages; (8) all- 
day industrial or commercial school for persons under 16 temporarily 
unemployed and for exceptional pupils transferred from established 
schools; (4) evening classes for persons over 16 years of age. 
During the year 1912-13 local industrial boards were appointed 
in 35 of the 39 cities having 5,000 or more inhabitants. Schools 
were maintained in the following cities during that year: Beaver 
Dam, Beloit, Chippewa Falls, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Green Bay, 
Janesville, Kenosha, La Crosse, Milwaukee, Marinette, Madison, 
Manitowoe, Oshkosh, Racine, Superior, Sheboygan, South Milwaukee, 
Two Rivers, Wausau, and West Allis. 
The number of persons served in the day classes during that year 
is approximately 6,000, and about the same number in the evening 
classes. 
The legislature of 1913 amended the law of 1911 by increasing the 
State aid from $35,000 annually to $150,000 annually, and it increased  
-P-A-G-E-324
  
  270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
the number of schools to be established from 30 to 45. By November 
1, 1913, the 45 schools had been located. The maximum amount of 
State aid to be paid any one city is $10,000. Milwaukee will spend 
$150,000 in these schools the coming year, and the rest of the State 
will spend approximately $300,000. This makes a total of $450,000 
available for these part-time schools during the year 1913-14. 
Contracts with apprentices have been executed at Beloit, West 
Allis, Kenosha, South Milwaukee, Fond du Lac, Madison, Superior, 
Milwaukee, Two Rivers, La Crosse, and Eau Claire. The number of 
pupils over 14 and under 16 who are working on labor permits has 
not materially decreased since the organization of these schools. 
Buildings are being equipped for all-day industrial schools at Eau 
Claire, La Crosse, Janesville, Milwaukee, Superior, Wausau, Sheboy- 
gan, Oshkosh, Fond du Lac, Green Bay, Racine, Kenosha, West 
Allis, and Beloit. 
Subjects taught.—The law specifies what instruction shall be given 
in these schools in the following language: 
For apprentices, two hours a week, instruction in English, citizenship, business 
practice, physiology, hygiene, and the use of safety devices. Three hours, such 
other branches as may be approved by the State board of industrial education. 
The State board has approved shop mathematics and drawing. 
For permit pupils the instruction shall include English citizenship, sanitation and 
hygiene, and the use of safety devices, and such other branches as the State author- 
ities shall approve. 
The authorities have approved applied mathematics, drawing, 
homemaking, sewing, cooking, and applied art. 
For all-day industrial or commercial school, six hours per day, five days per week; 
three hours of the six are devoted to shop and home activities and three hours to 
related academic instruction. The evening continuation classes study machine 
drawing, gasoline ‘engine practice, architectural drawing, applied design, pattern- 
making, plumbing, free-hand drawing, shop mathematics, cabinetwork, forging, 
millinery, dressmaking, sewing, household arts, retail selling, telegraphy, shorthand, 
typewriting, bookkeeping, electricity, citizenship, English, English for foreigners, 
hygiene, and interior decorating. 
INDIANA. 
Legislation.—V ocational education in Indiana has been put upon a 
firm and comprehensive basis by the new Indiana vocational educa- 
tion law, passed February 22, 1913. This law provides: 
1. That school cities, towns, and townships are authorized to 
maintain and carry on instruction in elementary domestic science, 
elementary industrial work, elementary agriculture, as a part of 
their regular course of instruction, and that regular courses in agri- 
culture, domestic science, and in industrial subjects must be offered 
in all commissioned and certified high schools of the State. This 
work has been designated by the State board as prevocational work,
-P-A-G-E-325
  PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 271 
to distinguish it from the vocational work, to be done in the special 
vocational departments and schools. No State aid is provided for 
prevocational work. 
2. The law also provides: that vocational departments and schools— 
all-day, part-time and evening vocational schools for domestic science, 
agriculture, and the industrial arts—may be established as a regular 
part of the public-school system of the State. The controlling pur- 
pose of these vocational departments and schools must be ‘‘to fit for 
profitable employment,” and if organized and conducted according 
to the definitions contained in the law and the rules and regulations 
adopted by the State board of education for the organization and 
conduct of the vocational departments and schools the State will 
pay two-thirds the cost of instruction. 
3. The law further provides that a county agricultural agent may 
be appointed for each county in the State who shall, under the super- 
vision of Purdue University— 
cooperate with farmers’ institutes, farmers’ clubs, and. other organizations, conduct 
practical farm demonstrations, boys’ and girls’ clubs, contest work, and other move- 
ments for the advancement of agriculture and country life, and to give advice to 
farmers on practical farm problems, and aid the county superintendents of schools 
and teachers in giving practical education in agriculture and domestic science. 
One-half the salary of these agents is paid by the State. 
4. The law further provides for the enlargement and reorganization. 
of the State board of education, which is authorized and directed to 
investigate and aid in the introduction of vocational education in 
the State; for the appointment of a local advisory committee repre- 
senting local trades, industries, and occupations, ‘‘to counsel and 
advise with the local school boards having charge of the management 
and supervision of the vocational departments and schools;” for the 
appointment of a deputy State superintendent of public instruction 
in charge of vocational education, and an ‘‘agent for supervising 
agricultural education,” ete. 
Appointments.—On June 1, 1918, Dr. William Frederick Book, of 
Indiana State University, was appointed State director of vocational 
education, and Z. M. Smith, of Purdue University, was appointed 
supervisor of agriculture. 
Bulletins —Three bulletins have thus far been issued by the depart- 
ment: (1) A letter of information regarding the vocational law and 
work, directed to superintendents and teachers, July, 1913. (2) A 
tentative course of study in industrial subjects for the public schools of 
Indiana, August, 1913. This bulletin gives detailed courses of study 
in agriculture, manual training, and domestic science for the seventh 
and eighth grades, and a two years’ course in these subjects in the 
high school. It sets forth the aim and purpose of the prevocational 
work in the regular schools, its relation to the vocational work to be

done in the special vocational departments and schools that are to 
be added, and gives general suggestions and helps to teachers for the 
prevocational work. (8) Present status of industrial and vocational 
work in Indiana, containing information for superintendents and 
school boards, presented at the State superintendents’ meeting, 
November 7, 1913. 
Problems considered.—The following problems are at present under 
consideration by special committees and the department: (1) More 
specific and concrete helps for the teachers engaged in teaching the 
prevocational work in the regular schools. (2) The final scope or 
limits of this prevocational work. (3) An effective plan for training 
teachers to do this compulsory prevocational work. (4) Listing and 
arranging projects in domestic science, manual training, and agricul- 
ture that can be taken up to advantage in-a county, city, or town 
school. (5) The preparation of a bulletin describing the most suc- 
cessful ways that have been used to correlate the instruction in indus- 
trial subjects in the regular schools with the teaching of English, 
mathematics, geography, and history. 
Investigations.—The following investigations are being made: (1) 
A vocational survey of the State to ascertain the vocations and pro- 
fessions that are open to the young people of Indiana. (a) The op- 
portunities presented by each as to wages, hours of labor, chances for 
promotion, etc. (b) The nature and character of the work. Its 
effect on health of worker, dangers, moral condition of occupation, 
degree of transiency or permanency of work, etc. (c) Kind and 
amount of preparation needed, and cost of same in time and money. 
(d) Opportunities for receiving the necessary training for these sey- 
eral vocations and professions, etc. (e) The facilities for vocational 
education and guidance in the State. 
(2) A standard card is in preparation upon. which may be kept a 
record of a pupil’s special interests, his success with different types of 
school work, and such other facts about his home conditions, mental 
and emotional characteristics or traits, special talents and interests, 
as would enable teachers and parents to give valuable help in advis- 
ing a boy or girl, in his later school career, in the choice of an occupa- 
tion or life career. 
(3) Arrangements are also making for an expert to devise, verify, 
and standardize tests that might be used by superintendents and 
principals to detect marked ability in the brighter pupils, in the field 
of art, music, mechanical manipulation, constructive work, science, 
business, invention, etc., so that these gifted pupils might early be 
given the opportunity of conserving and developing their special tal- 
ents and capacities. 
As the provisions of the law pertaining to State-aided vocational 
schools do not take effect until September, 1914, the department of

public instruction and State board are devoting the present year to a 
study of the problems involved in the organization and administra- 
tion of vocational work and to thé introduction of the prevocational 
work in the regular schools, and the work in vocational guidance 
indicated above. Regular vocational work has been begun in a 
number of cities, but the rules and regulations which are te govern 
the organization and conduct of State-aided vocational departments 
and schools in Indiana will not be published before February, 1914. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION UNDER STATE SUPERVISION IN PENNSYL- 
VANIA. 
The foregomg summary of recent activities in those States which 
have established State systems of industrial education may be sup- 
plemented by the following more extended statement, prepared by 
Roy Mason, of conditions in Pennsylvania. It is interesting to note 
some of the typical local problems that present themselves, and the 
ways and means that have been devised thus far to solve them. 
It has not been possible to tabulate results in the comparatively short time that the 
State department of public instruction has had charge of vocational education, but 
detached instances of excellent work accomplished are numerous. In addition to the 
statements made on another page concerning the practical results achieved in prepar- 
ing men to pass the State examinations for positions as mine foremen, assistant fore- 
men, inspectors, etc., it is to be noted that over 70 men were promoted to more lucra- 
tive positions in the collieries of the Lehigh Valley Coal Co. as the result of their 
studies during the past year in the Lehigh Valley mine schools at Centralia and Lost 
Creek. 
Dr. Nathan C. Schaeffer, State superintendent of public instruction, gets at the 
question of results in a different but equally convincing way. 
‘You will find the value of a boy’s time at school by subtracting the earnings of a life 
of uneducated labor from those of a life of educated labor. 
If an uneducated man earns $1.50 a day for 300 days a year, he does very well. If 
he keeps it up for 40 years, he will earn $18,000. An educated man is not usually paid 
by the day, but by the month or year; you will admit that $1,000 a year is a low 
average for the earnings of educated labor. 
For 40 years you have $40,000 as the earnings of the educated man. Subtract 
$18,000 from $40,000 and the difference of $22,000 must represent the value of a boy’s 
time spent at school getting an education. 
The same method of calculation can be applied to the workman who has acquired 
enough knowledge to master the details of the job ahead, and the resulting increase 
in wages multiplied into years amounts to a goodly figure. 
The Pennsylvania law designates the State superintendent of public instruction as 
the executive officer of the State board of education and confers on him authority to 
employ expert assistants; and it provides that any school district may, through its 
board of school directors, establish and maintain schools or departments of industrial, 
agricultural, and household arts education. 
SCHOOLS FOR MINE WORKERS. 
The most important of the several movements which led up to this legislation was 
the establishment of schools for the anthracite mine workers of Pennsylvania. Five 
years ago mine schools were established by the Young Men’s Christian Association 
in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. They held evening courses for the mine workers, to 
17726°—xp 1918—vot 1-18 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  274 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the support of which the coal operators contributed, one of them (the Pennsylvania 
Coal Co.) contributing as much as $10,000 in 1910. Realizing the value of these 
sporadic efforts, certain operators decided three years ago to contribute to the Mining 
Institute and to improve, if possible, and broaden the courses. Joseph J. Walsh, a 
State mine inspector, planned the courses free of charge. The schools thus established 
were helped out by the Mining Institutes, Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., Delaware, 
Lackawanna & Western Railroad Co., Susquehanna Coal Co., and Mineral Railroad & 
Mining Co. Big meetings of mine workers were held at which ideas were exchanged 
and papers read on many aspects of anthracite mining. These meetings have been 
described as partaking of the nature of a lecture course and an old-time debating 
society, with all of the merits and none of the defects of each. 
In 1911 the school laws of Pennsylvania were codified and provision was made for 
vocational education, both agricultural and industrial. In the spring of that year 
the institutes passed resolutions commending the action of the legislature. The ele- 
ment which was then lacking in the success of the growing schools was the supervising 
and guiding hand of the public-school authorities. In the spring of 1912 the insti- 
tutes petitioned the public school boards to take over the schools and administer 
them, which they did. 
In addition to the schools mentioned, for which the instructors were employed and 
the rooms furnished by the public-school authorities, and which were open to workmen 
employed by any and all of the coal operators, some of the opérators were maintaining 
private schools of a similar nature, open to all mine workers, but not under public- 
school supervision. The Lehigh Valley Coal Co. has had schools at Lost Creek and. 
Centralia since 1910; and their apprentice school at Drifton, where attendance is 
compulsory, but the apprentices are paid at their regular rate for the time, has com- 
pleted its sixth successful year. The Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co. main- 
tains schools for its miners at Mahanoy City, Shenandoah, Minersville, and Pottsville. 
So enthusiastic are the miners over the possibilities for advancement which these 
schools open to them that the foreman of one of the mines of the Scranton Coal Co. 
had the unselfish devotion to teach, single handed, 40 men all last winter in addition 
to his regular work. But the State department of public instruction is directly 
interested only in those schools which are conducted under the eegis of the public-school 
authorities. 
The subjects taught in the mine schools are mine gases, mine ventilation, mine 
law, mine surveying, electricity and magnetism, mechanics, air compression, the cor- 
related arithmetic, and general instruction in such subjects as timbering, trackwork, 
hoisting, hauling, pumping, drainage, steam and steam boilers, and the preparation 
of anthracite. There are classes for non-English-speaking adults and elementary 
classes for boys. It is not generally understood that there are nearly a hundred 
different positions in and about the mines for which special training is not only 
advisable, but often indispensable. 
The classes are held in the public-school buildings, as centrally located as possible 
for the accommodation of the largest possible number. It has been found the best 
practice to conduct these classes only three nights a week, but in some places the 
miners have insisted upon having the classes five nights a week. Under the provisions 
of the vocational-education laws by which they are to benefit, no session must be less 
than two hours, and there must be a total of 80 sessions, or 160 hours. The present plan 
is to have the schools continue 27 weeks, three sessions each week, beginning in 
October each year. Former experience has shown that grown men should not enter 
elementary classes along with children, and so the present method is to have the 
classes at night for men only. 
A large part of the instruction has been given hitherto by public-school teachers 
who were not thoroughly equipped for the particular subjects and work. The insti- 
tutes employed a director to look after the men at Nanticoke and Shamokin, who 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
  
PROGRESS IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 275 
spent one week a month visiting the men. He was employed by the coal companies. 
After the public-school authorities saw the value of the movement and that the schools 
were in their control, they gave their hearty and enthusiastic support. More and 
better work is prognosticated for the season of 1913-14. 
The tendency has been to limit the instruction to the men workers underground, but 
the curriculum is to be broadened to include the foreman and the engineer. Some 
work is even contemplated for driver boys and some to educate door boys to become 
driver boys. A practical school organizer will be in charge, and the mine foremen, 
assistant mine foremen, and the younger engineers will be asked to officiate as teachers 
and pass along their knowledge. This means a great sacrifice of time and effort, but 
no more than that of the men who are making the effort to profit by their sacrifice. 
ASSISTANCE OF ADVISORY BOARDS. 
One point upon which the State department of public instruction lays great stress 
in the development of plans is that there shall be advisory committees representing 
both the employers and the employed to cooperate with the public-school authorities 
in the proper conduct of the schools. This will unite the three necessary elements, 
the knowledge of the needs of the employer and of the employee and the knowledge 
and experience of the public-school authorities—which is the strongest combination 
possible. 
In the bituminous mining region of Pennsylvania less work has been done. There 
are mine schools at Ellsworth and Cokesburg, 95 per cent of whose aggregate popula- 
tion of 3,000 persons consists of foreigners or the children of foreign-born parents. At 
these schools the courses vary to some extent from those of the anthracite mine schools 
on account of the different requirements of the bituminous mines, but they are essen- 
tially the same. All of the men from these schools who took the State examination 
this year for mine foremen’s certificates passed and secured their certificates. They 
were six in number. There were also cooking classes for foreign women at Ellsworth 
last year. 
SCHOOLS FOR MECHANICAL TRADES. 
At Williamsport there has been an industrial night school conducted by the public- 
school authorities for about three years. It was established to give courses in con- 
nection with the Pennsylvania State College engineering department, and gives 
instruction in electricity, mechanical drawing, materials of construction, mathematics 
adapted to the various local trades, arithmetic, geometry, and algebra—all as applied 
to the problems confronting the students in their daily work. There are lumber 
mills, rubber works, silk mills, furniture factories, tanneries, many machine shops, 
and other manufacturing plants in this town. 
The city of Scranton conducts two night classes in cooking and sewing and millinery 
for both men and women. The classes are held in the public-school buildings and 
supported by the public-school district. These are two of the few graded night 
schools in the country. Drawing, both architectural and commercial, is also taught. 
The curriculum of such a night school depends upon the dominant industry of the 
community. 
In Philadelphia is one of the oldest trade schools in the East, founded in 1906 in-one 
of the elementary public schools, which conducts both day and night classes. Last 
year over 1,000 apprentices attended the night classes, where instruction is given in 
electricity, the sheet-metal trades, carpentry, patternmaking, plumbing, and other 
subjects with a definite application to the industries of that city. In the day classes 
instruction is given in patternmaking, electrical instruction, carpentry, printing, 
sheet-metal work, mechanical and architectural drawing, and sign painting. It is a 
significant fact that several of the trade-unions require their apprentices to attend the 
night schools.  
-P-A-G-E-330
  
  276 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In the Altoona high school there is a day course in which machine-shop practice 
and patternmaking are taught. The aim of this school is primarily to prepare boys 
for employment in the local mechanical industries, particularly the shops of the 
Pennsylvania Railroad, which contributed $25,000 for the equipment for trade 
instruction. 
In York an interesting cooperative plan of teaching was instituted in 1911. Forty 
boys from the local machinery manufacturing industries were paired off so that one 
of each couple could attend the courses every alternate week. They were taught 
the mechanics of machinery, physics, and geometry. After the courses were started 
the rate of pay of apprentices was increased and at graduation they are classed prac- 
tically as journeymen. 
Pittsburgh boasts two elementary industrial schools which are prevocational— 
that is, they give each student a variety of experience in order to enable him to make 
a selection of a trade for his life work. The courses include the metal trades, car- 
pentry, patternmaking, the machine trades, and electrical construction. : 
CONCLUSION. 
The foregoing is a brief summary of what is done in Pennsylvania in industrial 
education with the cooperation and assistance of the public schools. It refers only 
incidentally to the private or philanthropic industrial schools in which the tuition 
is also free. Under an act passed May 1, 1913, the appropriation of $140,000 can be 
used to reimburse these schools to the extent of two-thirds of the cost of teaching the 
practical and related technical and academic subjects of the previous year, up to a 
maximum of $5,000, provided that the State board of education through the super- 
intendent of public instruction has approved their organization, control, location, 
equipment, courses of study, qualifications of teachers, methods of instruction, con- 
ditions of admission, employment of pupils, and expenditures of money.

Vv. CULTURE, 
   
  The appreciation of fine art is what is called “culture.” 
Tack and need of culture in the United States. Responses to this need. 
Final ambiguity in the word education. Instruction in culture does not insure education in it. Let 
patience have her perfect work. 
I, EDUCATION. 
The word “education” is a very ambiguous one, and the parent of 
much misunderstanding. It conveys the general idea of a modifica- 
tion of personality in three senses, which may be called respectively a 
loose, a broad, and a narrow sense. In the loose sense education is 
synonymous with influence, in the broad sense with improvement, 
and in the narrow sense with teaching. 
277
-P-A-G-E-332
  278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The loose sense was thus defined by John Stuart Mill in his rectorial 
address at the University of St. Andrews in 1867: “ Whatever helps 
to shape the human being—to make the individual what he is, or 
hinder him from being what he is not—is part of his education.” 
Now every one of our experiences in life helps to shape us. Some 
trace is left upon us by each. We are somewhat different afterward 
from what we should have been had this particular event not hap- 
pened. Hence, using the word in the loose sense, nothing short of 
the whole life history of any one constitutes his education. “ Educa- 
tion is life.” 1 The alcohol that contributes to make the European 
what he is, and the opium that contributes to prevent the Asiatic 
from being what he might be, are educational forces. Most readers 
will meet this claim with a mental revolt which is proof that the 
loose sense of the word “education” is not the customary one, but an 
extravagance of speech. Those who, like most of us, believe in and 
wish to forward education, will refuse to admit that it includes all 
influences, the bad as well as the good, the demoralizing as well as the 
elevating. We shall demand that when people talk about education 
in our hearing they shall mean something good by the word. They 
shall not mean such influences as a fascinating scoundrel may exert 
upon a weak-willed companion, or such as a mental shock exerts 
over the reason it dethrones. Nothing shall be education for us 
which is not an improving influence. 
This second, or broad sense of the word “education” has been 
analyzed with admirable clarity by President Hadley. “In the 
broad sense it [education] includes every exercise of activity which 
is valued, not for its direct results, but for its indirect effects upon 
the capacity of the man who is engaged therein.’ Every experience 
in whose result upon the personality we can see the promise of, 
future good; every event whose ineluctable trace upon us is formative, 
and neither indifferent nor deformative, is part of our education; 
and only such events are. Using the word in this broad sense, 
Richard Steele said of Lady Hastings that to know her was a liberal 
education. Here was a vivid and gallant recognition of a perpetual 
outflow of humanizing influences from a lovely woman. The remark 
is quoted also as a tribute of Chateaubriand to Madame Récamier. 
Yet we should not speak of Lady Hastings as an educator, nor 
treat of Madame Récamier in a history of educationin France. There 
is a narrow sense in which the word is most commonly used. Although 
North American vim has been traced to the dry air of our continent, 
the latest achievements of the United States to the impulse given 
by the freeing of Cuba, and no greater formative influences have ever 
existed in this country than the examples of Washington and Lincoln, 
the United States Bureau of Education does not observe and record   
1 Symposium on Education. The Brooklyn Eagle, 1903. 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 279 
such factors of national progress as climate, crises of history, or 
commanding personalities. Education as most commonly understood 
means more than influence, more even than formative influence. 
It means intentional formative influence—the purposed molding of 
one personality by another. This is the common, everyday root 
meaning that runs through the words education, educator, educa- 
tional effort, educational appliances and the like; and this root 
meaning Mill expressly ‘recognizes in the address at St. Andrews. 
After defining education in the loose sense in his opening paragraph 
he devotes the rest of his discussion to that ‘which each generation 
purposely gives to those who are to be its successors, in order to 
qualify them for at least keeping up, and if possible for raising, 
the level of improvement which has been attained.”” Emerson uses 
the term in this customary sense, alluding also to a possible broader 
meaning when he writes: ‘What we do not call education is more 
precious than that which we call so.” * The most elevating influences 
of all, he thinks, are those which are not intentionally applied and 
so not customarily spoken of as a part of education. People are 
molded to better effect without formal means than by any of the 
apparatus we call didactic. 
These three senses—the loose, the broad, and the narrow—do not 
exhaust the ambiguities of the word education. Each of the three 
has a primary and secondary meaning duly set forth in the dictionary. 
The primary meaning is that of a process; the secondary that of its 
product. Education means at once the imparting of capacity 
and the capacity imparted; the communication of knowledge or skill 
and the knowledge or skill communicated. In one sense it means 
an operation of which the mind or body is the subject; in the other 
a mental or bodily condition at which the operation aims. When 
we say ‘‘The control of education should be entrusted to the State,” 
we are using the word in its primary sense of a process which the 
State should apply to its citizens. When we say ‘‘Popular education 
is vital to a democracy,” we are using the word in its secondary sense 
of a product which a democracy needs to develop within itself. 
This manifold ambiguity affords ample room for misconception. 
A confusion between the loose sense, in which education means 
influence of any kind exerted upon the individual, and the broad 
sense, in which it means formative influence only, lends itself to a 
fatalistic optimism. If every experience is part of our education, 
then whatever is, is in the right direction. If the world is all a school, 
then all’s well with it literally. A resolute faith that the world 
may be made better gives place to the enervating persuasion that its 
every detail is for the best. We dare not prevent anything lest 
we lose its lesson; nor dare we bring about anything, ignorant as we

  280 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
are whether we can better what is already for our good. So old- 
time doctors forbade ether in childbirth lest the lesson of its pains 
be lost. Through the use of one word for both improvement and 
influence, the glamour of the one envelops the other also. We take 
up our abode on the borderland of a fool’s paradise. ‘ 
A confusion between education in the broad sense of formative 
influence and education in the narrow sense of intentional formative 
influence tends to an opposite error. We are misled into thinking 
educational effort the panacea for all the ills of society. In particular, 
we exalt educational effort in its narrowest sense—that of the in- 
fluences directed exclusively upon the young en masse. If education— 
meaning formative influence—includes, as in this sense it does, 
every agency of personal advance, then all that need be done to 
insure the indefinite improvement of the individual is to look to 
our system of education—meaning the formal training given by 
each generation to the next. The glamour of the idea of the better- 
- ment of character concentrates itself upon one of the means to this 
end—and, as Emerson notes, one of the less precious means. Our 
faith in the machinery of instruction becomes unconsciously inflated 
beyond all reason. The school becomes a fetich. We overlook 
chronic failings of schooling at its best; its development of the 
memory at the expense of the intelligence, its comparative impotence 
to perfect the will. ‘‘Sir,” said Wellington to his highly instructed 
aide, ‘‘you have too much knowledge for your comprehension.” 
Of some royal children Henry Crabb Robinson writes: ‘‘These 
children are overcrammed; they know all the sciences and languages, 
and are in danger of losing all personal character and power of thought 
in the profusion of knowledge they possess.”+ Again, furnishing 
the mind does not in itself direct the will. In technical language, 
judgments of fact and judgments of worth are mutually irreducible. 
There is no mental chemistry by which J see can be transmuted into 
I choose. However we train the mind, unless the heart be independ- 
ently disposed, we are but fashioning an instrument of futility or a 
weapon of evil. But these criticisms of education in the narrow 
and narrowest senses have the ring of lése-majesté to those whose 
enthusiasm is fed by the broad meaning of the term. 
Finally, a confusion between education in the sense of process and 
education in the sense of product helps toward a fictitious valuation 
of preparatory agencies. We come to cherish training mistakenly for 
its ownsake. It is a common human failing to forget the end for the 
means. Mr. Chesterton has said that practical men generally know 
everything about the matter they have to deal with except what it is 
for; inclined, as Terence wrote, propter vitam, vivendi perdere causas. 
The use of one vocable for both means and end favors this shortsight-   
1 Diary IL, p. 104.
-P-A-G-E-335
  POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 281 
edness. If education—in the sense of developed capacity—is the 
ideal for humanity, then education—in the sense of the development 
of capacity—is the greatest thing in the world. Yet this is a conclu- 
sion impossible to thinking beings. If the development of capacity 
is the greatest thing in the world, then developed capacity is secondary, 
and since an end takes precedence over its means, the development 
of capacity is tertiary. Nevertheless we have just asserted it primary. 
The way out of this self-stultifying tangle is resolutely to hold the two 
ideas of process and product apart, in spite of their common name, 
and clearly to acknowledge that it is the exercise of capacity that 
gives its development worth. Schooling was made for man and not 
man for schooling. As President Hadley has said, an educational 
process is one which is valued for the capacity it engenders. Only in 
so far as the built character emerges, as its capacities show their 
development in action, do our efforts in character building prove their 
merit. The good life, and not the business of preparing for it, is the 
greatest thing in the world. 
For the purposes of the present discussion of popular education in 
fine art, it will be convenient to use education in the sense of process, 
not of product, and in its narrow but not its narrowest sense. So 
choosing among the ambiguities of the term, it will signify intentional 
formative influence, whatever its appliances and whoever its subjects. 
Artistic education will denote all training in fine art, whether given 
in school or out, to adolescents or adults. 
II. FINE ART. 
Works of fine art are commonly called creations of the imagination. 
The definition is simple, clear, and unequivocal, but not satisfying. 
Is not asteam engine also a creation of the imagination, or a coal mine, 
or an intrigue, since all exist in the fancy of their projectors before 
existing in fact? Wherein does a work of fine art differ from any 
other plan brought to pass? 
In that it is finished when it is imagined, and is put into external 
form only to preserve it. Dante writes: ‘Who paints a figure, if he 
can not be it, can not draw it; that is to say, no painter could draw a 
figure unless he previously made it in his mind as it ought to be.’ 
But a steam engine, a coal mine, an intrigue, are intended to be more 
than they are in advance in the mind. They are only begun when 
they are designed and are not done until the design is executed. They 
who execute them, not being “of imagination all compact” aim 
beyond giving ‘‘to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.” An 
artificer in embodying his fancy may be inspired by either of two pur- 
poses—that it should exist permanently or that it should bring about 
something else. In the first case, the work of his hand is a work of 
  
1 Canzone XVI: as interpreted by himself in the Convito: IV. Cap. 10.
-P-A-G-E-336
    
282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
fine art; in the second, a work of useful art. The aim of a work of 
useful art—a steam engine, a coal mine, an intrigue—lies beyond itself, 
in the flight of trains, the payment of dividends, personal fates. The 
aim of a work of fine art lies within itself{—that it should be perceived 
as it has been imagined. However an artist may be governed in 
embodying his visions by what he aims to have them accomplish— 
whether to reconcile himself with Heaven, to turn his fellows to good 
courses, to impart to them information outside the work itself, to win 
himself fame, or buy himself bread—it is that in them which he puts 
there solely not to let it die that constitutes its substance as a work 
of fine art. Its artistic content is comprised within what it is and 
does not extend to what it does. 
The avowal is met everywhere among artists and their critics. 
Goethe wrote: ‘‘I sing as the bird sings that lives in the branches. 
The song that must from the throat is a reward that richly pays.’ 
Again, ‘“‘The wish for applause which the writer feels is an impulse 
that nature has implanted in him to entice him on to something 
higher,’”? that something higher being the sharing of his happiest 
thought. To a strongly religious nature like Cowper poetic genius 
was— 
The gift 
To trace Him in His words, His works, His ways, 
Then spread the rich discovery, and invite 
Mankind to share in the divine delight.* 
The motive of expression, essential to fine art, has been stated in 
sober and modest prose by our own William M. Hunt: Artists 
“expose their work to the public, not for the sake of praise, but with 
a feeling and hope that some human being may see in it the feeling 
that has passed through their own mind, in their poor and necessa- 
rily crippled statement.” * Of Shakespeare, Lowell writes: ‘‘I have 
said it was doubtful if Shakespeare had any conscious moral inten- 
tion in his writings. I meant only that he was purely and primarily 
poet.” > Again, ‘‘The question of common sense is always, What is 
it good for’—a question which would abolish the rose and be an- 
swered triumphantly by the cabbage” °—the cabbage being good to 
destroy for bodily support, the rose only to enjoy while it lasts. 
A work of fine art, according to these avowals, is something of 
which the simple contemplation is worth while; and the artist cre- 
ates it that this contemplation may take place. His purpose—that 
the work shall be perceived as it has been imagined—conveys two 
implications.

POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ABT. 283 
First, there is involved in the conception artist—or poet in the 
wide meaning of zoentic, or maker—the idea of a public. Creation, 
in the artistic sense, implies contemplation. The maker can not be 
thought without the beholder. Goethe wrote: ‘‘The artist is not 
conceivable alone, moreover does not want to be alone. The work 
of art challenges men to delight in it, and to share their delight in it.” + 
Alphonse Daudet has written: ‘The artist is not a hermit. How- 
ever one may seek to retire from or lift oneself above the public, it is 
always in the last analysis for the public that one writes.’ ? 
Second, a work of fine art is an open letter, addressed not to 
particular individuals, but to any who can read it. With an 
outlook as wide as humanity, its aim is reached, not by every inspec- 
tion of it, but only when it is perceived as it has been imagined. 
The artist is a half-being whose complement is the beholder who so 
perceives his work. This perception by the one which duplicates the 
imagination of the other is what is called the appreciation of fine art. 
In printing, when the outlines of one impression are exactly super- 
posed upon those of another, the two are said to ‘‘register.” In like 
manner, in order that a work of fine art should exist, the mind of the 
beholder must ‘‘register”’ with that of the artist. It is the scientific 
fashion nowadays to think of every activity of mind as having its 
counterpart in some special activity of brain—a current, or explosion, 
or however else we may conceive it, of a particular kind. Using 
this convenient theory, appreciation may be said to consist in the 
exact reproduction in another brain of certain currents or explosions 
that once took place in one perhaps long since molderea into dust. 
It is in this perpetual reperformance of a strain that once beguiled a 
single fancy that fine art has its being. 
The appreciation of fine art is therefore at once an integral part 
of it and a definite form of response to its creations, namely, the 
precise echo of the voice that bade them live. A work of art does 
not exist for a beholder who simply enjoys himself over it; he must 
enjoy it. He must make himself over in the image of the artist, 
penetrate his intention, think with his thoughts, feel with his feel- 
ings. Okakura-Kakuzo writes: ‘‘An eminent Sung critic once made 
a charming confession. Said he, ‘In my young days I praised the 
master whose pictures I liked, but as my judgment matured I praised 
myself for liking what the masters had chosen to have me like.’” 
Again, ‘‘The tea master, Kobori-Enshiu, himself a daimyo, has left 
to us these memorable words: ‘Approach a great painting as thou 
wouldst approach a great prince.’” * The same comparison has been 
used by Schopenhauer: ‘‘One should look at a picture as one meets 
a monarch, waiting for the moment when it will please him to speak

and for the subject of conversation which it will suit him to choose. 
One should not be the first to address either the one or the other, for 
thereby one runs the risk of hearing only one’s own voice.”’+ This 
attitude is that of the understanding of fine art in the capital accepta- 
tion of that word. The picture, the statue, the building, is a sign 
that something once existed in the fancy of another which he was 
unwilling to let die. What was that something? When we have 
answered this question aright—always a searching question, often 
difficult, sometimes insoluble—we comprehend the work, and not 
until then. Then, and not until then, do we perceive it as it was 
imagined. 
The testimony of those who know is unequivocal on this point 
also. Luther’s estimate of the extent to which a reader who would 
understand literature needs to duplicate his author appears in the 
last writing from his hand. ‘‘Virgil, in his Bucolics, can be under- 
stood by no one who has not been five years a shepherd. Virgil, in 
his Georgics, can be understood by no one who has not been five years 
afarmer. Cicero, in his Letters, can be understood by no one who 
has not shared in a large public life for five and twenty years. The 
Holy Scriptures let no one think he has thoroughly digested unless 
with prophets like Elijah and Elisha, with John the Baptist, with 
Christ and the Apostles, he has ruled religious communities for a 
hundred years together.’ ? The genuine lover of art, Goethe tells 
us, ‘‘feels that he must lift himself up to the artist in order to enjoy 
his work.2 In a comment on another remark of Goethe’s, M. Paul 
Bourget thus describes the temper of appreciation: ‘‘Goethe ex- 
pressed the principle with his accustomed depth in saying, ‘If one 
have not studied things with a partiality full of love, what one 
thinks about them is not worth saying.’ * * * ‘To be partial in 
the sense in which the Altmeister of Weimar used the expression 
means to have given the artist due credit, to have placed oneself at 
his standpoint, to have associated oneself with his purpose, to have 
demanded from him nothing that he did not intend. * * * This 
power of sympathy marks the true lovers of literature, those to whom 
it is really a living thing.”’* Saint-Saens notes that the present 
generation can neither comprehend nor love the music of Gounod, 
“regarding it in a false light and giving it a significance altogether 
different from what the composer intended.® The appreciation of 
poetry seemed almost an impossible task to Oliver Wendell Holmes. 
“Hardly anyone ever understands a poem but the poet. * * *

It fits the mental mold in which it was cast, and it will hardly fit any 
other.”* How fleeting and uncontrollable our sympathy with plastic 
and pictorial art may be is vividly revealed in Hawthorne’s Notebooks. 
Of the Vatican sculptures he writes: ‘‘It is as if the statues kept, for 
the most part, a veil about them, which they sometimes withdraw, 
and let their beauty gleam upon my sight; only a glimpse, or two or 
three glimpses, or a little space of calm enjoyment, and then I see 
nothing but a discolored marble again. The Minerva Medica re- 
vealed herself to-day.” Again, of Guido’s Hope, ‘‘If you try to 
analyze it, or even look too intently at it, it vanishes, until you look 
at it with more trusting simplicity.” ? Of the Preludes and Fugues 
of Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavichord, Moritz Hauptmann wrote: 
“They are as difficult to hear 4s to play; and even hearing is not all 
of it. One must know them so perfectly that one can, as it were, 
create them oneself.”* Writing of pictures, John La Farge notes 
that ‘‘they are excusable who feel as if they had made the work 
which they admire. They become, for an instant, the man who 
made it.” 4 
Two corollaries of interest result. The power of appreciation in 
everyone is limited to those artists of whose natures he partakes. 
Those artists alone rise into prominence who reflect the spirit of a 
time. Of the limits of appreciation Sainte-Beuve writes: ‘‘Accord- 
ing to a very acute and just remark of Pére Tournemine, one admires 
only those qualities in an author of which one has the germ and root 
in oneself.” > Okakura-Kakuzo makes the same observation. ‘‘We 
must remember that art is of value only to the extent that it speaks 
to us. It might be a universal language if we ourselves were uni- 
versal in our sympathies. Our finite nature, the power of tradition. 
and conventionality, as well as our hereditary instincts, restrict the 
scope of our capacity for artistic enjoyment. Our very individuality 
establishes in one sense a limit to our understanding; and our esthetic 
personality seeks its own affinities in the creations of the past.” ° 
Of the artist as the interpreter of his age, Joubert writes: ‘‘The 
writers who possess influence are those who express perfectly what 
others think and who awaken in others ideas or sentiments on the 
point of being born. It is at the bottom of the heart of peoples that 
literatures exist.” 7 Renan concludes negatively: ‘‘Wherever there 
is no public to nourish and inspire genius, it comes to nothing.” *

In the terse saying of the Chinese sage Lao-tse: ‘‘If a noble man finds 
his time, he rises; if he does not find his time, he drifts.” 4 
A last question transfers the discussion of fine art to a wholly 
different order of ideas. Defining it as fancy brought into being for 
its own sake, is its existence justified independently of other results ? 
We have here left the sphere of what is, and entered that of what 
should be. The transition is obscured in the familiar contention 
over “art for art’s sake,’ which like most disputes, owes its diffi- 
culty to its complexity. Besides confusing the nature of fine art with 
its value, the phrase compresses at least four questions regarding its 
value into one debate. Should men devote time and labor simply 
to immortalizing happy thoughts? Yes. Are the charming aspects 
of evil things fit subjects of fine art? “Sometimes; tragedy, for exam- 
ple. Should an artist embody his conceptions without regard to 
their influence? He can not. Are not the most captivating fancies 
and the most consummate utterances always the indirect result of 
useful aims? Not always. But however these and other questions 
of worth may be answered, the truth remains that the sole factors 
of artistic creation are a moment too good to lose and a hand cun- 
ning enough to hold it. Its essence is expressed in the exclamation 
of Faust: Verbleibe doch! Du bist so schén! “Remain! Thou art 
so beautiful!” ? The artistic motive, mixed though it always is with 
others, is in itself the impulse to impart imaginative joy for its own 
sake. 
III. EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 
The content of a work of fine art is the imaginative joy to which 
it owes its being; and in the apprehension of this content by a be- 
holder the work is consummated. Fine art, being in its entirety the 
union of creating and beholding, offers to education a two-fold oppor- 
tunity. Formative influence may be applied by intention either to 
develop creators or to develop beholders. The purpose to develop 
creators is narrowly special. Poets are born, not made, and their 
ratio to the total of births is always small. Nor could a large pro- 
portion of the community be spared from the realities of life to 
devote themselves to imaging its ideals. As a matter of actual sta- 
tistics, those who make fine art in any form their profession, whether 
as artists or so-called artisans, are but a minute fraction of the whole 
population. But the purpose to develop beholders is widely general. 
Everyone can be, and in greater or less measure is, a beholder of 
works of art.

IV. POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 
Hence, popular education in fine art, meaning by this phrase an 
artistic education which is owed to every one, consists in forming 
beholders. The phrases “education in appreciation,” ‘teaching the 
enjoyment of works of fancy,” express its appropriate sphere. The 
advice of Aristotle regarding training in music was “Lei the young 
pursue their studies until they are able to feel delight in noble melo- 
dies and rhythms.” + They were to be trained not to make but to 
like; not as poets but as lovers of poetry. The injunction still 
demands emphasis. Fenollosa writes: ‘| * * * We find pre- 
valent discussions and experiments concerning the teaching of art 
in schools so permeated with the tacit assumption that its main 
purpose is to provide an incipient training for possible painters and 
sculptors, that warning seems necessary. This is to lose sight of the 
great public value of art. Is it for this that we teach so widely the 
other fine arts—music and literature? Do we aim, by our musical 
instruction in schools, in time to train up a nation of eighty million 
composers? Are our courses in literature devised to transform us 
into a community of poets? Public education in art does not look 
so much toward creation as to comprehension.” ? In another sphere 
Aristotle’s counsel has been lately voiced by President Wilson. “A 
university is a place where the many are trained to a love of science 
and letters, and a few only to their successful pursuit.” 
That the many should have their share in the life of the imagina- 
tion, and hence have the right to receive aid therein, admits of no 
serious doubt. The real experience of no one is so rich that he can 
afford to dispense with imaginative experience; nor so poor that he 
can not take advantage of it. Uhland writes: “Who sees alone what 
is, has lived his life.’ * Yet what is fine art, it may be asked, but a 
copy of nature? Were it not better to study the original rather 
than reproductions that never can equal it? The objection betrays 
a radical misunderstanding of the relation between art and nature. 
Fine art is to be compared, not to a mirror, giving back as close a 
copy as may be of the scenes before it, but to a sky in which new 
counterparts of earth eternally appear. It is an exhaustless firma- 
ment about the real world, incredible as may sometimes seem the 
endless birth of new luminaries therein. John Stuart Mill relates 
that at one period of his early life “I was seriously tormented by the 
thought of the exhaustibility of musical combinations. The octave 
consists only of five tones and two semitones, which can be put 
together in only a limited number of ways, of which but a small pro- 
portion are beautiful; most of these, it seemed to me, must have

been already discovered, and there could not be room for a long suc- 
cession of Mozarts and Webers, to strike out, as these had done, 
entirely new, and surpassingly rich veins of musical beauty. This 
source of anxiety may perhaps be thought to resemble that of the 
philosophers of Laputa, who feared lest the sun should be burnt out.”? 
It is indeed hard for us now to share in the fear. For we look back 
upon the immense development of music since Mill wrote, upon 
Verdi, upon Wagner, upon Debussy; and out upon the musics of 
other continents, with their unheard-of complexities of rhythm, their 
differing tones and semitones, their alien keys and modes, their inde- 
pendence of the octave itself. As each true servant of the imagina- 
tion is born, a new type of ideal existence adds itself to real lifo for 
every kindred soul. When we turn from nature to art we take our 
way into happy worlds which gifted men have formed and are ever 
forming anew from the materials of this sorrowful earth, as the 
kaleidoscope forms figures from its bits of glass. 
Popular education in fine art, if directed as it should be upon the 
development of comprehension, will include but a modicum of technical 
instruction. More would be useless, and even defeat the aim pursued. 
The problems and methods through which an artist struggles form 
no part of the imaginative joy he seeks to impart. They are but 
means to that end. The scaffolding is not a part of the building, 
nor the stage-machinery of the spectacle. Technica! knowledge aids 
a beholder only if it bring to his attention elements in a work for 
which his eyes are too dull. It is at the same time a hindrance 
by diverting his mind from the work itself. Francesco d’Ollanda 
reports Michel Angelo as saying, ‘‘What one has most to work and 
struggle for in painting is to do the work with a great amount of 
labor and study in such a way that it may afterward appear, how- 
ever much it was labored, to have been done almost quickly and 
almost without any labor, and very easily, although it was not.’’? 
Unless the Latin maxim Ars est celare artem is mistaken in demand- 
ing that a beholder should not follow the poet at work, pedagogic 
theory is mistaken in demanding that he should. Not artists, im- 
mersed as they must be in technique, are the best critics, but ‘‘those 
who have failed in literature and art” as Lord Beaconsfield wrote in 
Lothair; or, as it may be added, those who would have failed had 
they not known better than to try. The true beholder, in the words 
of Herr von Seydlitz is he ‘‘who can partake in the joy of creation, 
while sparing himself its travail pains.” *

POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 289 
Neither will education in appreciation assign a large place to the 
history of art. Its study is a study of the relations between the 
artistic monuments of different times. The comprehension of art 
is the study of these monuments themselves. No two objects of 
attention can well be more different than a relation and the objects 
between which it holds. It will be said, different as they are, 
knowledge of the one helps to a grasp of the other. True, to the. 
abstract recognition of one or other perhaps unessential point. 
Like technical knowledge, historical knowledge offers a crutch to 
observation. It may direct the eyes that need directing; and it may 
also direct them to no material advantage. Professor Adolf Philippi 
writes: ‘‘First see, then read—for those who need reading, and 
many never need it at all.’’ Professor Carl Neumann advises to the 
same effect. ‘‘The historical understanding of a work of art is 
advanced when we look at it in connection with other works of the 
same master and time, and of earlier and later times; its artistic 
understanding is advanced hardly a step by the process—at most 
in that the comparison and contrast of different works sharpens and 
trains the eye.” And again, ‘‘How often is one asked— * * * 
‘What art history is to be recommended in order to awaken an under- 
standing of art?’ But one answer can be given. ‘No art history 
at all, The way to art lies though the individual artist.’” + Com- 
paring the content of a work of art with the influences it represents, 
Professor Justi writes: ‘“The more one grasps this worth—incompa- 
rable, and independent of all historical connections—the further are 
removed these side issues.” ? Of the dependence of Leonardo on 
Verrocchio, Mr. Berenson writes: ‘Would the full realization of this 
dependence help us to appreciate and enjoy Leonardo as an artist? 
No, for the term ‘‘artist’’ from the aesthetit, the only point of view 
we may admit, signifies nothing more nor less than a summation of 
works of art; and unless we have enjoyed and appreciated these, 
much though we may know about the man, his manners, his environ- 
ment, his temperament, his anything you please, we shall know nothing 
of the artist.” ® For we shall know only things related to his work, 
not the work itself; and in the process of relating them to it, joy in 
the work—the essence of its comprehension—evaporates. Théophile 
Gautier wrote: ‘The necessity of analyzing everything has made me 
necessarily and irremediably sad.”* As the history of art is actually 
taught in books and lectures, its only serious value for the under- 
standing of art begins when it ceases to be art history and becomes

comment on one or another individual work by one or another 
master—in a word, criticism. 
For instruction by criticism is the essential element in the teaching 
of artistic understanding, and should be the predominating element 
in popular education in fine art. Criticism in no degree hostile, be it 
said; for in reality there is no such thing as hostile criticism. A 
hostile critic is a contradiction in terms; as if one should speak of 
bloody ermine. The sentence of Goethe just quoted from M. Paul 
Bourget is an unassuming rendering of the magnificent words of St. 
Paul, “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and 
have not love, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.” 
Sainte-Beuve, the master critic of the France of a generation ago, 
often quoted with approval a sentence of Joubert: ‘‘The charm of 
criticism is the penetration into other spirits.”! The true critic is an 
alter ego of the artist; loving his work as the artist himself loves it, 
if no less conscious of its imperfections. He is the ideal beholder, 
and it is from him that all effective training in beholding must come. 
On him the whole fabric of popular education in art must rest. To 
amplify the problem of Aristotle, How can we win the people to 
delight in noble art of every kind? Not by technical training beyond 
the rudiments, nor by the history of art; but by leading them into 
the presence of noble art in the company of those who themselves 
delight in it. M. Anatole France describes the rare joy of “visiting 
some old and magnificent monument in company with a savant who 
happens at the same time to be a man of taste and intelligence, 
capable of thinking, seeing, feeling, and imagining.’ Prof. Licht- 
wark, recounting his experiments with school children in the study 
of pictures, writes: ‘ Whoever does not heartily enjoy art had better 
leave this kind of insttuction for others. As well might a person 
who does not care for music give music lessons.’’? M. Emile Faguet 
has this type of education in mind when he writes: ‘‘Taste can not 
be imparted, I repeat. * * * Nevertheless, if one can not instruct 
others to have taste, one can show taste in the presence of others and 
incite them to give proof of it. * * * Only incite them, it is true, 
but strongly incite them. * * * Contact with, and even shock, 
from a man of taste, rouses, stimulates, vivifies, sets in motion those 
capable of taste. .* * *° This is not instruction, but intercourse; 
an intercourse not giving taste, but accustoming and inspiring others 
to have it.”* No better instances of what M. Faguet proposes could 
be given than his own studies in literature. They illustrate in per- 
fection what Matthew Arnold has called the highest office of the

critic. ‘‘Surely the critic who does most for his author is the critic 
who gains readers for his author himself; gains more readers for him, 
and enables those readers to read him with more admiration.’”’* So 
Stapfer compares the critic to Mercury—‘‘the gods’ interpreter to 
men.”? 
Chosen companionship in beholding is the corner stone of an 
effective popular education in fine art; a corner stone as yet left 
aside in our educational system. Its accredited surrogates are still, 
in the main, instruction in the technique and history of art; plainly 
because of two great practical difficulties in the way of instruction in 
its understanding. The capacity of appreciation is limited in every 
one, among teachers by profession no less than others; and—in part 
for physiological reasons—narrowly limited among the young. 
Those who instruct in the technique and history of art throughout 
the land would be more than human could they warmly respond to 
more than a fraction of the creations of the arts they represent. 
Again, works of fine art are the product of brains full grown and 
fully furnished, while the nerve centers of adolescents are but partly 
developed, nor has experience of life cut the nervous channels where 
are stored the materials of fancy, and through whose excitation alone 
the beholder becomes an alter ego of the artist. The fire is insufficient 
in the teaching body and the materials to create a blaze in the body 
taught. A wide training in the comprehension of fine art calls for 
teachers far beyond the ranks of the profession; and for disciples far 
beyond the roll of our schools and colleges—in every age and occu- 
pation. To be really popular, education in fine art must be organ 
ized mainly as an addition to our existing machinery of instruction. 
Its task will be to offer to the whole population, old and young, the 
opportunity to contemplate works of art in the companionship of 
persons to whom these particular creations make special appeal. 
Such a system would proceed by the formation of classes for the 
study of public monuments of art, of the works of literature in our 
public libraries, of the pictures and sculptures in our public galleries 
and museums of art, of current concert programs, or operatic and 
dramatic performances. It would act through a corps of amateurs 
of art, in the true and etymologic sense, each choosing the sphere of 
his predilectior, and held to no service beyond. So organized, the 
whole available culture of the nation would be enlisted in the cause 
of its own extension. 
Vv. CULTURE. 
What is the meaning of this often-used and often-abused word 
“culture”? Lord Rosebery has just called culture ‘the intelligent

292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
enjoyment of literature,” or, as we may interpret him, such an enjoy- 
ment as corresponds to the intention of the writer. He was speaking 
in a library, or would, we may believe, have included fine art in any 
of its manifestations. So ‘amplified, the phrase would run “ the intel- 
ligent enjoyment of works of the imagination.” The definition given 
by Matthew Arnold implied a similar limitation and conveyed the 
like idea. Culture is “to know the best that has been thought and 
said in the world’’;* not to know it abstractly, but “to feel and en- 
joy” it “as deeply as ever we can”;? tasting its sweetness as well as 
opening our eyes to its light, in the two words of Swift made famous 
by Arnold himself a generation ago. In culture we cross the line 
between the real and the ideal; between our fortunes and our pref- 
erences. We cross the line also between the formation of capacity 
and its exercise; passing from preparation to fruition, from life for 
the sake of something else to life for its own sake. Returning to 
President Hadley’s definition of education in the broad sense—‘“ any 
activity which we value not for its direct results, but for its indirect 
effects upon the capacity of the man who is engaged therein,” cul- 
ture appears as its complementary opposite—an activity which we 
value not for its indirect effects upon capacity, but for its direct 
results. It is the acceptance of an imaginative joy given us for its 
own sake by a man endowed with the rare power to offer it. It is 
that activity of the spirit which we have here learned to call the ideal 
beholding of a work of art. 
Of this ideal beholding some of our latest visitors from Europe tell 
us we of the United States do exceedingly little. Concerning his 
American students in French literature Professor Lanson writes: 
“Whenever I offered them a subject of study, they said to me at 
once ‘What must we read?’ and when I answered ‘The text of your 
author’ I could notice that they were a little surprised, that the 
direction seemed meager to them”—an attitude due, as Professor 
Lanson finds, at once to “an unskillful application of erudition”’ 
and a complete absence in American instruction of the exercise 
called in France “the interpretation of texts.”® Mr. Lowes Dick- 
inson writes: “In America there is, broadly speaking, no culture. 
There is instruction; there is research; there is technical and profes- 
sional training; there is specialism in science and in industry; there 
is every possible application of life to purposes and ends, but there 
_ is no life for its own sake.” * The indictment is true. It is only in 
speaking narrowly and having regard to sporadic instances, largely 
unacknowledged, that life in the imagination for its own sake can 
be said to exist in the United States. What commonly passes for

culture among us is at best only instruction; not the activity of 
apprehending and feeling ideals, but the activity of trying to pre- 
pare for such an apprehension and feeling. Since it is possible to 
try to enjoy all types of creative fancy, though wholly impossible 
for any one to succeed in more than the appearance of enjoying them 
all, a single narrow interest—that of appearing interested in things 
of the spirit—has usurped the place of the infinite variety of in- 
terests which the spirit can genuinely nourish. Instructed, the classes 
which represent culture among us are; but not, as classes, culti- 
vated. Lowell called the people of this country “the most common- 
schooled [it might now perhaps be added, the most college-bred] and 
the least cultivated people in the world.” As a people we sorely need 
to realize that culture is not a making ready for life in the future 
but a practice of life in the present; not work but play; not tepid and 
supercilious but warm and gracious; not the issue of spiritual notes 
ostensibly payable on demand, though always in the event extended, 
but the payment of a specie of the soul, as occasion calls. The world 
position which the United States has assumed within recent years 
makes the duty of an international culture—of a penetration of the 
spirit of other peoples, a‘recognition of their ideals, and as far as may 
be a sharing in them—our instant duty. This patriotic obligation 
will be sooner met, we shall sooner take our place with intelligence 
and sympathy at the council table of the powers, if we clearly realize 
that it is of a piece with the real significance of the common phrase— 
the appreciation of fine art. 
The efforts which hitherto in the United States have represented 
popular education in fine art in the sense of a training of the public 
have been, in large measure, individual and difficult to follow like 
the culture which they presuppose. In our colleges and universities 
men honored in American letters have sought by special courses of 
instruction devoted to masterpieces of literature to impart to students 
a vital understanding of these works. The lectures on Dante given 
by Lowell at Harvard taught many receptive minds what the com- 
prehension of a great poem really involves in thought and feeling; 
and not a few among living writers and critics are accomplishing like 
results for the present generation. There has also existed in schools 
during recent years a marked tendency to lay stress on the study of 
individual works of literature with a view to their understanding. 
A truly popular education in two other fine arts has been under- 
taken by organized effort within recent years, also originating within 
Harvard University. A series of chamber music concerts is given 
each year at Cambridge, the performances being accompanied by 
explanatory comments. The Drama League of Boston seeks by 
various means to develop an appreciative public for good plays 
performed in that city. These and similar movements elsewhere 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
    294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
constitute a new factor in public instruction aiming directly at 
intelligent enjoyment. 
Within the field of art, narrowly so-called—meaning painting, 
sculpture, architecture, and their minor derivatives—the public- 
school art leagues formed within recent years in various cities repre- 
sent a kindred purpose. Besides promoting artistic decoration of 
school buildings, they often provide instruction looking to the appre- 
ciation of art. The department of visual instruction. of the New 
York State Education Department illustrates another form of the 
like endeavor. An important branch of the activity of women’s 
clubs, as well as of many private classes, aims at instruction, largely 
mutual, to the same end. The widespread present movement to 
promote civic art, in aiming to utilize the opportunities for imagina- 
tive creation presented in our public buildings and parks, promises 
to contribute effectively to the artistic education of the people. The 
gift of the Ferguson and Samuel funds for the plastic decoration of 
public places in Chicago and Philadelphia are benefactions marking 
an epoch in this country—its first conspicuous foundations wholly 
devoted to the general culture. The recent creation of municipal, 
State, and National art commissions tends in like manner to foster 
the interest of the whole people in the tangible arts, and offers the 
occasion for effort to make this interest more intelligent. 
Within a few years museums of art throughout the country have 
begun active efforts to forward the popular understanding of their 
contents. In 1903 there was held at Mannheim in Germany a 
congress of museum officials to deal with the question: How shall 
our museums be made more useful to the people at large? An impor- 
tant section of the proceedings was devoted to reports from classes 
held in German museums in previous years. These were in the main 
unofficial, the lecturers acting by the consent but not with the 
authority of the museum administration. Such a volunteer effort 
had several years previously been permitted at the Museum of Fine 
Arts in Boston. During several months of 1896 representatives of 
the Twentieth Century Club of that city, acting under the supervi- 
sion of an officer of the museum assigned to the duty, met visitors to 
the museum on Sunday afternoons for the purpose of giving them 
information about the collection of plaster casts shown. It remained 
for the museum to make the effort official, and this step was later 
taken. In 1907 the museum itself began a similar service covering 
all its collections—the first museum of art, as it appears, to offer its 
visitors the personal aid of its officers in the appreciation of its 
exhibits. The new opportunity was called the Docent service of the 
museum and was made free to all. Its aim was not to give random 
information but interpretative information about the collections— 
information which should help the spectator toward getting from a  
-P-A-G-E-349
  POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 295 
picture, statue, or work of minor art the full impression the artist 
intended it should make. Docent service thus illustrates popular 
education in fine art in the exact sense already advocated above. 
Its presupposition is a sympathetic understanding of the work shown 
on the part of the speaker about it; and to insure this all the specialists 
at the Boston Museum and many other selected persons have borne 
their share in the instruction, each within the limits of his choice. 
The visitors, old and young, individuals, groups, and school classes, 
annually met in this way in the galleries have rapidly increased in 
number since the service was established and are now counted by 
thousands. Personal guidance of some kind may be said to have 
since become a recognized duty of American museums of art. The 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute in 
Chicago, and others of our chief museums later offered their visitors 
the services of a representative specially assigned to the instruction 
of visitors, and the newer museums are accepting the duty of guidance 
as an indispensable means of influence. In England, in pursuance 
of a suggestion offered in 1910 by Lord Sudeley, an official ‘ guide- 
demonstrator” was in 1911 appointed at the British Museum, and the 
system is at present under consideration at the National Gallery and 
other museums of art in London. A press notice of the suggestion 
remarks upon “the fact that for the past two years such a system 
has been in operation at the Metropolitan Museum in New York and 
for a longer time at the Boston Museum.” Professor Réau, in France, 
writes that it is their “constant attention to popular education that 
forms the chief originality of American art museums,” the official 
recognition of the duty “being almost wholly unknown in the 
museums of France and Germany.’ It would be vain to hope, he 
writes again, that the words of a Docent “however eloquent, could 
transmit the sense of beauty to those who have not been endowed 
with it. But he will be able in analyzing a work of art to train the 
eyes of the people and teach them to see betiter.” ? 
The question presents itself—why may not a similar effort be made 
by public libraries? Like museums they are guardians of a treasury 
of the imagination, although, unlike museums, they do not display 
their treasures. Yet why should they not—mutatis mutandis— 
interpret books to the public as museums are beginning to interpret 
exhibits? Why must people always read books to themselves? 
Why should not public libraries read books to them? President 
Wilson has written: ‘“‘The chief and most characteristic object of 
library endeavor is to get men to read the best books and into the 
habit of reading.” * The direct means to this end is to offer the

  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
public interpretative readings from these books. This our public 
libraries should do through official representatives just as our 
museums are offering official companionship in seeing their pictures 
and statues. The Docent system demands to be extended to libraries. 
The names of many famous men who have said things better than 
they have ever been said since are inscribed on many library walls. 
There is Taylor, ‘‘the Shakespeare of divines.” Who ever reads a 
page of him? Who ever reads nowadays even the most conspicuous 
English classics like Utopia or Amelia or Dr. Johnson’s Tour in the 
Hebrides? How many even among college graduates read a play of 
Shakespeare once a year? Poetry does not exist as the poet intended 
until read aloud, until the actual sounds he fancied strike upon the ear. 
To most people it always remains a wraith of its real self. No imprac- 
ticable talent is needed, no Fanny Kemble or Charles Dickens, but 
simply an intelligent man or woman with a pleasant voice such as every 
educated circle can show; and no large lecture hall, but an apartment 
or alcove where a small group could gather without disturbing others. 
An enjoyable and profitable acquaintance with a book can in many 
cases be given on a single occasion by appropriate extracts connected 
by comment; and for larger works a series of readings might be ar- 
ranged. A special reading-room or special reading-rooms might be a 
part of the plan of the library building, and a special corps of official 
readers—Docents in literatue—made an adjunct of the library force. 
The schedule of readings might be duly laid out as a part of the library 
work and duly advertised as a part of its facilities. The entering 
wedge has already been provided in the story-telling courses for 
children now arranged by many of our libraries; but these courses 
do not give literature itself but only paraphrases of literature, and 
are not for adults but for the very young. We need to return to 
the ancient method by which the Iliad and the Sagas passed from 
mouth to mouth, before the art of printing had made the enjoyment 
of literature solitary and voiceless. To their original function as 
custodians of the written word, our public libraries have within a 
generation added that of its active advocates. Let them now add 
another—that of organs of its public utterance. 
A final ambiguity in the use of the over-burdened word education 
brings the number of its familiar meanings to ten. The modification 
of personality either pure and simple (the loose sense) by improve- 
ment (the broad sense) by teaching (the narrow sense) or by schooling 
(the narrowest sense); either as process or product, make up eight 
meanings; and the processes of teaching and schooling in their two 
acceptations of the contribution of the pupil on one side and the 
teacher on the other, complete the ten. Professor Gildersleeve warns 
us that ‘Education is the normal development of the powers that 
lie in man’s nature, and is not to be confounded with instruction,
-P-A-G-E-351
  
POPULAR EDUCATION IN FINE ART. 297 
which merely furnishes the means and appliances of education.” 1 
There is on the one hand the actual development of capacity in the 
taught, and on the other simply the use of means toward this aim, 
apart from success or failure. In the one sense education means 
the activity of learning, in the other the activity of teaching. The 
question ‘Does education really educate?” signifies by the noun the 
share of the instructor, and by the verb the share of the pupil. The 
distinction has been wittily expressed in a new rendering of an old 
proverb: ‘‘You may send a boy to college, but you can not make 
him think.’”’ The sending of our whole people to a college of culture 
added to our present educational system might still do little to 
make them think. Let it suffice us to be assured that what little it 
should do would be well worth the pains. Professor Nash has said: 
“We men and women of to-day are standing on the verge of a future 
whose course it is impossible to foresee. If we are to play our part 
through, if we are to follow our duty home, we need both a cool 
head and a warm heart. The geologian deals with acons as an 
oriental monarch with his people’s gold. To the impassioned re- 
former a year is an age. The need of our time is a manhood that 
shall gain a little—just a little—of the geologian’s time-sense.” ?

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS.

Secretary of the American Association of Museums; Director of the Charleston (S. 0.) 
Museum.

learned societies—Public museums—Museum cooperation with public schools—Travel-

ing—Conclusion. 
  NUMBER OF MUSEUMS. 
There are in the United States approximately 600 museums,’ of 
which about 50 per cent are devoted exclusively or chiefly to natural 
science, about 25 per cent to history, and about 10 per cent to art. 
The remaining 15 per cent are devoted to special or to miscellaneous 
subjects. 
Approximately 88 per cent of these museums derive their financial 
support from schools, colleges, or universities; 35 per cent from 
societies or associations; 15 per cent from city governments; 7 per 
cent from private individuals or endowments exclusively; 4 per cent 
from State governments; and 1 per cent from the National Govern- 
ment. 
These statistics do not indicate the relative importance at the pres- 
ent time of the subjects treated by museums or the importance at- 
tached to museums by the various organizations which support them. 
The value of museums depends, not upon numbers, but upon the effi- 
ciency with which they serve the purposes of the supporting organi- 
zation. This is a matter of judgment in every case and can not be 
determined mathematically, but the amount of money appropriated 
annually for the museum is the best indication of the value placed 
upon it by those who support it. Financial statistics are difficult to 
obtain, especially from institutiens which give inadequate support to 
their museums, but such as are available indicate certain significant 
conditions. Thus, 27 academies, colleges, and universities reported in 
1910 total appropriations of $14,671 for museums, while the same 
number of municipal? museums received a total of $980,900. Only   
1These statistics are based upon the Directory of American Museums, published for 
the American Association of Museums by the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences in 1910. 
2The term “ municipal museum” is here applied to museums which receive all or most 
of their maintenance from city governments, even though not actually owned by the city. 
299
-P-A-G-E-354
300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
five colleges or universities gave more than $1,000 to museums, while 
only one municipal museum received less than $1,000. Ten societies 
and associations reported museum appropriations from general funds 
to the amount of $38,309, but only five of these gave more than 
$1,000. Fifteen State museums received $138,650, and 16 privately 
endowed museums had an aggregate income of $778,727. 
Comparing the number of museums of each class which reported 
their income with the total number in the country, we find that 
reports were received from more than half of the State museums, 
nearly half of the endowed museums, one-third of the municipal 
museums, and only one-eighth of the college and university museums. 
In the last class the most common report was “Maintained from the 
general funds of the college,” or “ Variable and irregular appropri- 
ations from college funds.” It is probably safe to say that very few 
of the college museums which did not report their income receive 
more than $500 a year. Although a few museums under control of 
colleges or universities or of societies or associations have endow- 
ments sufficient to insure their maintenance, the great majority are 
inactive and deteriorating, while the municipal and State museums 
are growing in numbers, size, and usefulness, and are receiving 
increasing appropriations of public moneys and contributions from 
private sources. The contrast is shown in a summary of the average 
incomes of the museums whose statistics are available. Thus, col- 
lege and university museums receive appropriations averaging about 
$500, and an average income from all sources amounting to a. little 
over $6,000; museums supported by learned societies receive appro- 
priations averaging $383, and incomes of a little over $8,000 from 
all sources; State museums, from appropriations almost exclusively, 
$9,330; museums dependent upon endowment and miscellaneous 
sources, $48,670; and municipal museums, from city funds, $41,515, 
and from all sources, $51,878. These figures would be very much 
smaller were it not for the large incomes of a very small number of 
very wealthy museums. 
GENESIS OF MUSEUMS. 
A further important aspect of the classification used above is 
revealed by the dates of founding of museums of the various classes. 
The two oldest museums, that at Charleston, S. C. (1773), and the 
East India Marine Society Museum (now a part of the Peabody 
Museum), at Salem, Mass. (1799), were both founded by societies. 
The former was designed to afford a complete representation of the 
natural resources of the Province of South Carolina and their rela- 
tion to commerce and industry. The latter was a repository for the 
curiosities gathered by the ship captains of Salem from distant parts 
of the world.
-P-A-G-E-355
  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 801 
The first half of the nineteenth century gave rise to a number of 
museums in connection with both learned societies and colleges. 
Among these may be mentioned the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine 
Arts (1805), the Bowdoin College Art Museum (1811), the Academy 
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (1812), the Allegheny College 
Museum (1820), the Boston Society of Natural History (1830), the 
Wesleyan University Museum (1831), and the Portland Society of 
Natural History (1843). The beginning of the United States Na- 
tional Museum, in 1846, marks the culmination of the museum de- 
velopment of the period. 
COLLEGE MUSEUMS. 
The founding of science museums by colleges and learned societies 
was a natural expression of the interest of the time in descriptive 
natural history. The displacement of that interest by the biology 
of the succeeding half century, with its emphasis upon laboratory 
studies in morphology and embryology, is the fundamental reason 
for the large number of neglected and inactive college museums 
to-day. The teacher of biology under present conditions requires 
small synoptic series of specimens for demonstration, but seldom has 
either time or inclination for the care and increase of general sys- 
tematic collections, while the elaborate technique of the large pub- 
lic museums is entirely beyond his power. In a few large universities 
great museums of the highest value to research are firmly estab- 
lished, but the security of their foundation consists in endowment 
funds. A conspicuous example of this type is the great Museum of 
Comparative Zoology at Harvard, founded by Louis Agassiz in 1852. 
In 1858 the corporation of Harvard University began to make a 
small monthly allowance for the care of the collection, but its devel- 
opment has been chiefly due to a grant of $100,000 obtained by Prof. 
Agassiz from the Legislature of Massachusetts in 1859, to subsequent 
State appropriations amounting to $193,500, and to private endow- 
ment. It is now supported by the income from an endowment of 
about $600,000. The Fogg Art Museum at Harvard is also supported 
solely by the income from private endowment. 
From the deplorable condition of the great majority of college 
museums of natural history, from the small amounts of money appro- 
priated by the colleges for their maintenance, and from the high 
quality of work in natural science done by colleges which have no 
extensive museums, we are forced to conclude that a large scientific 
museum is not essential to college work as at present conceived, and 
that the proper maintenance of such a museum is a burden which few 
colleges will carry. Where other funds can be utilized these museums 
may do valuable educational work under the general auspices of the 
college, but the demand for such work must usually come from out-
-P-A-G-E-356
302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
side the college. It is not questioned that some use of museums is 
made by college instructors in their class work, but equal results could 
usually be attained by comparatively small study collections, and the 
maintenance of extensive display collections is a luxury. On the 
other hand, large endowed museums in association with universities 
undoubtedly constitute an important aid to research, and as such are 
highly valued. 
College art museums are frequently nothing more than miscella- 
neous collections of portraits and objects of art valued for decorative 
purposes rather than as a basis for instruction. They seldom have 
any regular income, and more rarely a curator. The Farnsworth 
Museum of Art is a notable exception, receiving its support from the 
general funds of Wellesley College, supplemented by an endowment 
for the chair of art. It is extensively used by students in the art 
department. The Fogg Art Museum, already mentioned, is enabled 
by its endowment to carry on highly organized instruction in con- 
nection with the art courses in Harvard University. The relation 
of the art museum to university instruction has been discussed by. 
the director of the Fogg Art Museum in a paper before the American 
Association of Museums! The art museums at Beloit, Bowdoin, 
and Smith Colleges are also adequately maintained by reason of 
endowment and are actively utilized. 
MUSEUMS OF LEARNED SOCIETIES. 
The status of the museums supported by scientific societies differs 
somewhat from that of college museums. It has already been stated 
that both these classes of museums were an expression of the interest 
in descriptive natural history which characterized the first half of 
the last century and continued until about 1870. After that date 
comparatively few of these museums were established. Scientific 
interest passed to problems of structure and function, and we have 
traced the disastrous effect of this change upon the support of col- 
lege museums. The scientific societies, however, retained in their 
membership a large proportion of systematists, whose work has been 
invaluable in extending and arranging descriptive biological in- 
formation, and whose collections have enriched the museums of their 
societies. It is only necessary to mention the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia and the Boston Society of Natural History, 
whose publications and collections are the indispensable record of 
the progress of American science. The most successful of these 
museums derive their support in about equal proportions from the 
general income of the society and from endowment. Generally

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 803 
speaking, the maintenance of their publications and study collec- 
tions absorbs most of the regular income and renders difficult the 
educational work necessary to make a great popular museum. 
The neglected condition of college museums and the restriction of 
society museums to highly technical work combined to create in the 
popular mind the still prevalent conception of a scientific museum 
as a more or less dusty storehouse of interminable rows of bugs and 
rocks and “stuffed” animals as far removed from real life as the 
mummies it contains. The first century of American museums 
(1773-1873) was thus marked by the flood and ebb of a great popu- 
lar interest in museums as centers of recreation and instruction. 
There was at the end, however, a rejuvenation of the museum idea 
already discernible. 
PUBLIC MUSEUMS. 
The greatest and most active museums of America to-day, with 
few exceptions, have originated within the past 50 years and have 
had their phenomenal development within 25 years. A few ex- 
amples may be given: American Museum of Natural History (1869) ; 
Metropolitan Museum of Art (1869); Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 
(1870); New York State Museum (1870); Pennsylvania Museum 
(1876) ; Art Institute of Chicago (1879); Milwaukee Public Mu- 
seum (1882); Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (1889) ; 
Field Museum of Natural History (1894); Worcester Art Museum 
(1896) ; John Herron Art Institute (1896) ; Carnegie Institute Mu- 
seums (1896). Most of these museums are of a new type, being 
founded and supported either by private endowments or by munic- 
ipal or State funds. There is a marked decrease in the number of 
new museums founded by colleges or by technical societies, and 
museums are henceforth significant as public institutions. 
The conception of museums as storehouses of technical material, 
of interest principally to specialists, has been broadened until the 
primary object has become visual instruction. Many researches are 
best conducted in museums, but the expenditure of public funds is 
justified only by making the institution of practical benefit to the 
general public for recreation and instruction. To this end an aston- 
ishing degree of technical skill has been applied, and the success 
of the result is evidenced by the continually increasing amount 
of public and private money devoted to the extension of museum 
work. The motto of the American Museum of Natural History, 
“For the people, for education, for science,” expresses the ideal of 
the modern museum. 
A similar change of policy on the part of art museums may be 
noted. Until recently these museums have been content to exhibit 
objects of art in as harmonious settings as possible. It was assumed
-P-A-G-E-358
  804 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
that the significance of these objects would be evident to the visitor in 
proportion to his degree of artistic perception. The function of the 
museum was not conceived to include the education of the artistic 
sense of the visitor. To-day art museums are endeavoring to diffuse 
information about art and to develop appreciation of art in the 
general public. 
The introduction of the educational function into museums is the 
keynote of their phenomenal development in the past quarter century. 
They are now democratic in the highest sense, responsible directly 
to the people and developing in proportion as they satisfy the needs 
of the people. 
No account of this great change in the purposes and methods of 
museums would be complete without a tribute to the genius and clear 
vision of G. Brown Goode, assistant secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution in charge of the National Museum from 1887 until his 
death in 1896. Through both his administration of the National 
Museum and his peculiarly trenchant papers on museum subjects he 
exerted the influence of a great pioneer in the creation of the modern 
conception of public museums.’ His paper on “ The Principles of 
Museum Administration,” read before the Museums Association of 
Great Britain in 1895, is the first formulation of a general theory 
of administration, while his lecture on “ The Museums of the Future,” 
delivered before the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1889, 
is a prophecy already abundantly realized. He says: 
The museum of the past must be set aside, reconstructed, transformed from 
a cemetery of bric-a-brac into a nursery of living thoughts. The museum of 
the future must stand side by side with the library and laboratory, as a part 
of the teaching equipment of the college and university, and in great cities 
cooperate with the public library as one of the principal agencies for the enlight- 
enment of the people. 
Among other aphorisms which we owe to Dr. Goode, and which 
have been frequently quoted, we may cite the following: 
The public museum is, first of all, for the benefit of the public. 
An efficient educational museum may be described as a collection of instructive 
labels, each illustrated by a well-selected specimen. 
A finished museum is a dead museum, and a dead museum is a useless 
museum. 
Broad as was Dr. Goode’s view of the educational functions of the 
museum, he was more interested in the instruction of the general 
public than in cooperation with schools. He says: 
I should not organize a museum primarily for the use of the people in their 
larval or school-going stage of existence. The public-school teacher, with the 
illustrated textbook, diagrams, and other appliances, is in these days a profes-

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 305 
School days last, at the most, only from 5 to 15 years, and they end with the 
majority of mankind before their minds have reached the stage of growth most 
favorable for the reception and assimilation of the best and most useful thought. 
Why should we be crammed in the times of infancy and kept in a state of 
mental starvation during the period which follows—from maturity to old age— 
a state which is disheartening and unnatural, all the more because of the intel- 
lectual tastes which have been stimulated and partially formed by school life. 
SUPPORT OF PUBLIC MUSEUMS. 
Of the various methods of museum maintenance the most successful 
at the present time are those which depend upon public funds and 
private endowment. The organization of the American Museum of 
Natural History in New York City embodies principles which are 
being generally adopted in municipal museums. The clearest state- 
ment of these is contained in an address before the American Associa- 
tion of Museums by Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the 
American Museum.’ He says: 
The radical feature of our organization, which has been demonstrated to be 
almost ideal, is this: The city intrusts the government of the museum entirely 
to a board of self-perpetuating trustees. It provides the building and contributes 
a certain proportion of the maintenance. The trustees obligate themselves to 
present to the museum all the collections, to conduct all the scientific work, the 
publications, explorations, and everything of that kind. Thus, the heating, 
lighting, and actual care of the collections is supported by the municipality, 
but the collections themselves are the gift of the citizens of New York. 
You will see at once that this insures an interest on the part of the individual 
citizens in the growth of the museum which can not be secured in an institution 
governed wholly by the city. 
As a result of this plan of organization, many museums which re- 
ceive their maintenance chiefly from municipalities have large and 
increasing endowments and obtain contributions from private citizens 
for many of their activities. 
Museums supported exclusively from private endowment have no 
responsibility to the public, and are obligated only to administer their 
trust funds in accordance with the conditions imposed by the donor. 
The endowment of museums, however, is evidence of broad culture 
and a desire to benefit the public. Such endowments, therefore, are 
seldom so restricted as to prevent their use for educational work 
through the museum. 
MUSEUM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The most distinctively modern educational activity of museums is 
to be found in cooperation with the public schools. Probably no 
other subject has attracted such enthusiastic attention on the part of 
museum workers or yielded such large results.

  306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The Davenport Academy of Sciences and the Buffalo Society of 
Natural Sciences were among the first to organize definite coopera- 
tion with public schools. Mr. Edward K. Putnam states' that as 
early as 1877 Mr. Pratt, curator of the Davenport Museum, was 
endeavoring to establish a vital connection between the museum and 
the public schools. From 1878 to 1889 school children and classes 
from the public schools of the city and county came to the museum 
informally for lectures and demonstrations. Voluntary classes in 
botany and other subjects were conducted by the museum. In 1889 
a formal arrangement was made with the superintendent and princi- 
pals by which classes from the eighth and ninth grades came regu- 
larly to the museum for instruction by the curator. Mr. Pratt’s 
removal from Davenport the following year resulted in a suspension 
of formal instruction of this character until 1902, when it was re- 
sumed and extended to include all the public schools of the city, and 
in addition a regular class in nature study for teachers. Since 1904 
the school board has paid for half the time of the curator for this 
work. 
Mr, Henry R. Howland states? that in 1872 the weekly field ex- 
cursions of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences were composed 
largely of pupils from the high schools, and that when elementary 
science work was introduced into the grammar schools of Buffalo in 
1878 the science teachers were encouraged to bring their classes to 
the museum and to utilize its collections and rooms for instruction. 
This work continued and expanded until 1905, when lectures at the 
museum were made compulsory. In 1908, 234 lectures were given 
during the school year and were attended by about 20,000 children 
from the fifth to the ninth grades. An additional series of evening 
lectures on physiology was given for grammar-school teachers and 
advanced pupils from the high schools. This work is in charge of 
Dr. Carlos E. Cummings, secretary of the society, whose time, when 
not lecturing, is largely occupied in preparing lantern slides and 
specimens for illustration. In partial recognition of this work, the 
city appropriates $1,000 annually to the museum. 
Most of the active museums throughout the country now offer 
special facilities to classes from the schools. These commonly in- 
clude special guides or demonstrators in the exhibition halls and the 
use of classrooms and material, with lectures by members of the 
staff on request. In art museums it is becoming customary to assign 
members of the curatorial staff to act as docents in the exhibition 
halls. These docents do not give set lectures, but endeavor to assist 
small groups of visitors in the study of such objects as are of interest 
to them. The title “docent” was first given to an official public in-

  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 307 
terpreter of museum exhibits by the Museum of Fine Arts at Boston, 
in April, 1907. All the officers of that museum have upon occasion 
acted as docents, and the opportunity has been largely used, as well 
by the general public as by teachers and students. 
The most elaborate scheme of educational exhibits is undoubtedly 
that in course of development in the department of invertebrate 
zoology at the American Museum of Natural History. Here an 
alcove is devoted to each phylum of animals. At the end of the 
alcove the lower portion of the window space is utilized for a life- 
size ecological group showing the habitat of the animals whose mor- 
phology and embryology are illustrated in the neighboring cases. 
Thus, at the end of the Annulate alcove is shown a section of the sea 
bottom, with the worms and associated animals as they occur in the 
harbor at Woods Hole, Mass. Above the sand and mud the effect of 
water is produced by skillfully painted sheets of glass, through 
which the light filters dimly from the window. Above the water 
line a transparency 6 feet long shows the further side of the harbor. 
The animals in these groups are modeled in wax, glass, and cellu- 
loid, and every detail of the group is perfectly natural. The pre- 
liminary studies at the shore required the services of the curator, an 
artist, and a modeler. The construction of the exhibit occupied more 
than a year, and the cost was approximately $2,600. 
These reproductions of animal habitats are intended to bring 
vividly before the city child the natural world of which he may have 
no direct experience. From this glimpse of the life of the sea he 
turns to the adjacent cases and finds not only alcoholic specimens, 
but enlarged models of both the external and internal structure of 
typical members of the phylum, with abundant descriptive labels. 
Even university students in zoology find the study of these exhibits 
profitable, while to school-teachers and their classes they afford fa- 
cilities never before available. 
Such elaborate exhibits as those of the American Museum of 
Natural History, requiring a large staff of highly trained artists and 
the expenditure of large amounts of money, are obviously far beyond 
the resources of the smaller museums. The true measure of efficiency, 
however, is the ratio of results to resources, and in this respect the 
achievements of some very small museums are significant of the pos- 
sibilities of museum work. 
The Fairbanks Museum of Natural Science is a small, but very 
attractive, museum in St. Johnsbury, Vt. It is supported solely by 
endowment, and it is the policy of the trustees to maintain it as nearly 
as possible in the condition in which it was left by its founder. By 
virtue of its educational activity it has become an exception to the

  308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
general truth that “a finished museum is a dead museum.” Under 
the leadership of Miss Delia I. Griffin, director of the museum until 
June, 1913, it has adopted most of the successful methods of public 
instruction and has improved upon some of them. One of its best 
features is the “flower table.” The following description is given 
by Miss Griffin in her paper on “ The educational work of a small 
museum ”:+ 
The last large item of educational work to be mentioned is the flower table, 
From the time the first arbutus blossoms on a southern hillside until the witch- 
hazel lets fall its crinkled yellow petals late in the autumn a procession of wild 
flowers is to be seen in the museum. The specimens are arranged in clear glass 
vases, on tables in a prominent part of the hall. Frequently 50 specimens are 
displayed at a time, and often all the varieties of one flower are to be seen the 
same day. Last week the violet table held 12 varieties, all found within a 5-mile 
radius of the museum, and each September our 15 goldenrods are exhibited at 
the same time. 
In the case of rare flowers, some of the orchids for instance, only two or three 
flowers are displayed, often with a note warning the public of the danger of 
gathering them in quantity and so aiding in their extermination. The literature 
of the Wild Flower Preservation Society has a place on this table, and many 
of its leaflets are taken by visitors. 
All the flowers are labeled with both common and scientific names, and if a 
child prings a specimen, his name also appears. A large number of the flowers 
are brought by the children; many are gathered on the bird walks, and by the 
museum force when searching for herbarium specimens; and some of the rare 
contributions come from ladies, who, in their leisurely drives over the country 
roads of this vicinity, find these beautiful specimens. 
This flower display is easily the most popular feature of the museum work. 
Visitors come to it first and linger by it longer than by any other exhibit; sev- 
eral invalids watch eagerly for the reports of it in the weekly papers; and the 
children, competing with each other to see which shall bring the largest number 
of flowers, gain a familiarity with the specimens and the fields and woods in 
which they grow. More valuable yet is the healthy influence which absorbs the 
children’s minds and the love of nature to which they unconsciously grow. 
TRAVELING SCHOOL EXHIBITS, 
In order to obviate the loss of time and difficulties of transporta- 
tion involved in bringing large numbers of classes to the museum, it 
is now customary to send traveling exhibits from the museum to the 
schools. This work is done on an exceptionally large scale by the 
Philadelphia Museums. Under a State appropriation of $25,000 for 
two years, this institution prepares a large number of portable ex- 
hibits, illustrating geography, commerce, industries, and natural his- 
tory, for free distribution to more than 1,200 schools in Pennsylvania.*

EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 309 
The value of such exhibits in stimulating the interest of students 
and in conveying information has led to their very general use 
throughout the country. Their preparation requires expert knowl- 
edge and extensive facilities for collecting material, and these the 
museum usually possesses, while the schools do not. 
In one notable instance the board of education has established a 
museum, under the care of the assistant superintendent of schools, 
for the purpose of providing exhibits of this character for use in its 
schools. This is the Educational Museum of the Public Schools of 
St. Louis, which has been fully described by the curator, Mr. C. G. 
Rathmann.t There was no museum in St. Louis to which the board 
of education could apply for assistance of this character, and the 
exposition of 1904 afforded an opportunity of acquiring large amounts 
of material of the highest educational value. With this as a nucleus, 
supplemented by donations from other museums, the present extensive 
collection has been built up. The exhibits are arranged in direct 
relation to the courses in natural science, geography, history, reading, 
and art, and are grouped under the following general heads: (1) 
Food products; (2) materials for clothing; (3) other natural prod- 
ucts; (4) industrial products; (5) articles and models illustrating 
the life and occupations of the different peoples of the world; (6) 
plants and models and charts of plants; (7) the animal world; (8) 
minerals, rocks, and ores; (9) apparatus for illustration of physics 
and physical geography; (10) charts, colored pictures, maps, and 
objects illustrating history; (11) collections of art objects and models 
used by the classes in drawing; and (12) photographs, stereoscopic 
pictures, and lantern slides to accompany the preceding groups. 
The many collections under these heads are listed in a catalogue, 
from which each teacher makes requisitions once a week. The 
museum maintains its own delivery system for distributing and col- 
lecting the exhibits. Duplicate exhibits are prepared in sufficient 
numbers to supply the demand. In 1908 the curator reported that 
the museum had 1,000 different collections and 3,200 duplicates. In 
the first year 5,000 collections were sent to the schools; in the second 
year, 11,500; and in the first half of the third year, 10,000. In addi- 
tion to the loan collections, which are the chief feature of the 
museum, it maintains (1) study exhibits for teachers, (2) an exhibit 
of educational material from foreign countries, (8) an exhibit. of 
school work in St. Louis, and (4) a teachers’ library of 7,000 volumes. 
Further details of this work are contained in Mr. Rathmann’s paper, 
already mentioned.

CHILDREN’S MUSEUMS. 
The first museum organized solely for children is the Children’s 
Museum, established in 1899 as a branch of the Central Museum of 
the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. The trustees— 
expressed their purpose to form an attractive resort for children, with influences 
tending to refine their tastes and elevate their interests; to create an attrac- 
tive center of daily assistance to pupils and teachers in connection with school 
work; and to offer new subjects of thought for pursuit in leisure hours.* 
Miss Anna Billings Gallup, the curator under whose direction this 
interesting experiment has been so successfully developed, describes 
the plan of the museum as including (1) the preparation of collec- 
tions which children can enjoy, understand, and use; (2) an arrange- 
ment of material pleasing to the eye and expressive of a funda- 
mental truth; (3) briefly descriptive labels expressed in simple 
language and printed in clear, readable type; and (4) a system of 
instruction which children will voluntarily employ. Space forbids 
detailed description of the many unique and suggestive exhibits and 
activities of this remarkable museum, but the successful appeal which 
it makes to children is abundantly indicated by the statistics of 
attendance. The average annual attendance is 102,000, including an 
attendance of 18,700 on lectures. As many as 500 children have pre- 
sented themselves for admission to a lecture room with seating 
capacity for only 60. At such times the lecture is repeated again and 
again, while children wait patiently in line for admission. A new 
building, to cost approximately $175,000, is about to be erected by the 
city for the accommodation of this museum. 
A new children’s museum is now being organized in Boston, in 
charge of Miss Delia I. Griffin, whose work at St. Johnsbury has 
already been referred to. 
In addition to these museums established solely for children, men- 
tion should be made of the children’s room in the Smithsonian In- 
stitution at Washington. This room was set apart and equipped 
under the immediate supervision of the Secretary in 1900 or 1901 
“ for the benefit of very young people, their entertainment rather than 
instruction, as an attractive means of inculcating a love for nature.” 
The exhibits comprise: 
(1) A series of familiar American birds; (2) common European birds; (3) 
large birds of prey; (4) interesting water birds; (5) curious birds, such as the 
crocodile bird, kiwi, etc.; (6) some brilliant-colored birds; (7) curious nests 
and eggs; (8) a series of specimens with accessories representing protective 
mimicry, under the caption, ‘ How creatures hide”; (9) remarkable insects; 
(10) bright-colored shells; (11) other interesting invertebrates; (12) remark- 
able minerals.

  EDUCATIONAL WORK OF AMERICAN MUSEUMS. 811 
MUSEUM COOPERATION IN INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The rapid increase of vocational training and industrial work in 
public schools is already creating a demand for further assistance 
from museums, which they are meeting by lectures on the relation of 
natural resources to commerce and industry and by exhibits illus- 
trating processes of manufacture. It is altogether probable that this 
is but the beginning of a phase of museum work which will ultimately 
occupy a large place in the activities of general museums and lead to 
the establishment of special industrial museums. The need of indus- 
trial museums was urged before the American Association of Mu- 
seums in June, 1913, by Prof. Franklin W. Hooper, director of the 
Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.* 
CONCLUSION. 
The history of American museums during 140 years shows that 
four sources of support have been generally used: (1) Learned 
societies; (2) schools, colleges, and universities; (3) private endow- 
ment; and (4) municipal, State, or National funds. The first of 
these leads to museums of high technical value, but requires supple- 
mentary endowment for the best results. These museums are seldom 
able to compete with municipal museums in public instruction or in 
cooperation with public schools. The second source of support is 
responsible for the largest number of existing museums. They are 
valued less in college instruction to-day than they were in the first 
half of the last century, and rarely receive adequate support unless 
aided by endowment. Their condition is seldom satisfactory, and 
often pitiable. The third source of support is the foundation of some 
of the largest and most influential modern museums. It also supple- 
ments in a very valuable way the income of museums primarily de- 
pendent upon other funds. The fourth method produces the most 
active and progressive museums of the present time, because the con- 
tinuance of appropriations is contingent upon work of such broad 
scope and practical nature as to maintain the interest and approval 
of the general public. The most successful element of this work, and 
the one which has been most effective in obtaining both public and 
private funds, is the educational feature. This is the fundamental 
idea in modern exhibition, and it is supplemented, first, by organized 
public instruction through lectures, publications, and field excur- 
sions; and, second, by cooperation with schools. The latter includes 
the provision of special facilities in the museum for teachers and 
students, and the circulation of a great variety of portable exhibits 
among the schools in direct relation to their courses of study.

CHAPTER XIV. 
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1912-13.

ernment—Publications—Special collections opened to the public in 1912-13—School libraries—

Within the past year there has been a steady growth in all direc- 
tions of library endeavor and a perceptible widening of the knowl- 
edge of the library as an important factor in solving the problems of 
education of every variety, as well as a definite aid in the various 
forms of business and Government activity. The year covered by 
the months July, 1912, to June, 1913, shows a continuance of interest 
in the extension of library service on the part of private donors and 
public officials, unceasing effort on the part of library administrators, 
and a truer recognition of the value of books on the part of those who 
come in contact with good library service. 
On the whole the year has seen satisfactory progress. There still 
remain some parts of the country, happily growing fewer and less 
extended, where library service has not received the intelligent 
support that makes it productive, but every day sees the deadly hold 
of political favoritism growing slighter and an increase in appreciation 
of the opportunity of enlightenment offered by an efficient library. 
Buildings planned for service as well as beauty, trustees chosen for 
fitness and ability, administrators chosen for professional standing and 
equipment—of all these there are inspiring examples in the activities 
of the past year. 
NATIONAL AID. 
Deep disappointment over the failure to include books in the parcel 
post privileges (act of Aug. 24, 1912) has caused library organization 
of every kind to express formal resolutions asking for remedial legis- 
lation from Congress. The American Library Association, the League 
of Library Commissions, and the various State and local associations 
313
-P-A-G-E-368
  314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
have asked that books in transit between libraries be admitted to the 
privilege of parcel post rate.! 
The Library of Congress has continued to be of great assistance in 
general library service in issuing from time to time bibliographies on 
timely subjects of public interest, references on immigration, tariff, 
initiative, referendum, and recall. 
The Library of Congress has quietly built up the valuable collec- 
tions on its shelves untilit has approached in value and extent many 
of the famous collections in Europe. Its greatest handicap con- 
tinues to be lack of funds. While no large groups of printed books 
were presented this year, the aggregate of books and pamphlets 
received by private gift from many individuals and unofficial bodies 
was 11,256. 
The following collections were acquired during the fiscal year, 
though not by gift: The Hoe’s collection of books on the Spanish- 
American War; the library of the Tariff Board; the library of the 
National Monetary Commission; the records and books of the Ameri- 
can Colonization Society. : 
Lists of references on the following subjects have been compiled 
under the direction of the chief bibliographer: Capital punishment; 
commission government for cities; conservation of natural resources 
in the United States; the cost of living and prices; Federal control of 
commerce and corporations; impeachment; the monetary question. 
Other important publications of the library issued during the past 
fiscal year have been as follows: 
The bibliography of international law and continental law. By E. M. Borchard, law 
librarian. 1913. 93p. 26cm.

Prepared under the direction of O. G. Sonneck, chief of division of music, 1913.

The Navy Department spends $30,000 every year in libraries for 
its ships. Each “ship’s library” includes 300 books, usually tech- 
nical and more or less expensive. A “crew’s library” is usually 
made up of about 500 books of fiction, suitable for entertainment. 
About one-third of the books are replaced each year. The books are 
recommended by those in charge of the ships. An effort will be 
made to standardize the libraries. 
The Federal prison libraries have been subject to investigation in 
the past year by a committee from the league of library commissions. 
Recommendations for better organization of these libraries have been

presented to those in authority and were courteously received. A 
lack of funds prevents action at present. 
STATE AID. 
State aid to library service continues to be applied in 37 States, 
either through the State libraries or through the library commissions 
of the several States. The extent and value of the State’s aid-varies 
according to the effectiveness of these agencies. West Virginia, 
South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, 
Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming are still without official State aid. 
The State library associations in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and 
Montana are supplying the lack somewhat and are building up a 
sentiment in favor of State library service. 
An honorary library commission was appointed by the governor of 
Arkansas as an initial step toward securing library legislation for the 
State. 
The legislature changed the name of the Oregon library commission 
to State library and transferred to it 45,000 books belonging to the 
then existing State library, whose title was changed to Supreme Court 
law library. 
A free library commission for the State was authorized by the 
legislature of South Dakota, with an appropriation of $3,000 for 
traveling libraries. 
The Vermont commission secured legislation changing its name to 
Free public library commission. The legislature increased the appro- 
priation for the commission’s work $1,000. For general expenses the 
. commission now has $3,000 and the traveling libraries $1,500. Office 
expenses of the commission are hereafter to be paid outside of the 
appropriation. 
State aid through these agencies is conveyed by means of traveling 
libraries, library organizers, direct appropriation of money, and 
library schools. 
TRAVELING LIBRARIES. 
The traveling libraries movement of the past year has shown 
increased vitality and justified the expenditure made in its behalf. 
Traveling library work is shaped very materially by the county- 
library idea. California has led in this perhaps. On account of the 
accidental curtailment of the funds for the State library activities in 
1911, few traveling libraries were sent from the State library, and as 
the county library developed it was found more economical and 
successful as a means of book distribution. Now the books that 
formerly made up the traveling libraries are loaned in groups up to 
1,000 volumes to counties starting free libraries. Laws permitting 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
county libraries are in force in California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, 
Wisconsin, Tennessee, Ohio, Iowa, Oregon, and New York. 
An increase of $2,500 was voted by the legislature for traveling 
libraries in North Dakota, but was vetoed by the governor. 
The traveling-library commission of Idaho has $8,)00 for its work 
this year. Especial attention is given to books for juvenile readers, 
and special cases on agricultural subjects are in great demand. 
The Massachusetts Agricultural College sends traveling libraries 
consisting of books and pamphlets on related subjects. About 1,000 
of these books and pamphlets were loaned to 33 public libraries on 
request, in the form of small collections relating to harvesting, mowing, 
poultry, seed selecting, testing, etc. The books are primarily 
intended for libraries whose book funds are meager. 
Missouri has an increase of 40 traveling libraries and 1,737 volumes 
sent out. The following statistics show the scope: Libraries sent to 
groups of taxpayers, 69, with 3,575 volumes; public libraries, 14, with 
365 volumes; school and college libraries, 135, with 5,098 volumes; 
study clubs, 35, with 1,759 volumes; other organizations, 15, with 729 
volumes; individual loans, 5, with 11 volumes; charitable institutions, 
6, with 300 volumes. ‘Total, 280 libraries and 11,829 volumes. The 
books stocked at the commission now number 11,300 volumes. 
Expenses: Salaries, $3,500; books and cases, $2,501; traveling and 
contingent, $184. There are but six counties in Missouri that have 
not yet received traveling libraries. 
There are about 10,000 volumes in the traveling library collection 
of Indiana, which had a circulation of 60,171; 320 different organi- 
zations were served, and 1,261 requests were filled. Of these, 136 
were schools; 232, public libraries; 409, rural associations; 257, special — 
clubs; 114, clubs for general use; 113, groups of persons. Outlines 
which may be used as a basis in the preparation of club programs 
were sent throughout the State, accompanied by lists of books on the 
outlines. Twenty-one outlines were prepared on request. 
In the State of New York there are now 49,897 volumes in the 
traveling-library collection. There are 5,706 volumes in the fixed 
route, the remainder are in the flexible open-shelf collection. There 
are 77 sets of 25 volumes each especially for children. There are 483 
books for foreigners, printed in Italian, Polish, German, French, and 
Hungarian. The greatest demand has been for the Italian and 
Polish books, and next to these, the German. There were sent in 
response to application the following:

The largest number of libraries has been used by study clubs. 
There has been a steady increase in demand from groups of taxpayers. 
A reduction in fee has served to increase the demands from places 
without libraries. : 
Field work has been carried on mainly by the inspector and two 
library organizers. There are 500 libraries entitled to visitation. 
The number of visits has been less than 300. 
There are 4,421,901 books in free libraries, and of these 71 per cent 
are in cities, and of the latter 44 per cent are in New York City. The 
free circulation in cities was 87 per cent of that of the State. 
The Louisiana State Library Association, with the help of the 
Louisiana Teachers’ Association, has undertaken to provide traveling 
libraries for the rural communities. There is no library commission 
in Louisiana. 
There are 16 libraries in North Carolina supported in whole or part 
by town or county; 3 new library buildings were erected during the 
year, making 27 libraries now in homes of their own. The traveling 
library must be the largest factor in library work for the State, as the 
population of North Carolina is over 85 per cent rural. Libraries 
were sent last year to 66 counties, to schools or debating societies, on 
application signed by the principal of the school or the president and 
secretary of the debating society. The package library for the 
debating societies contains pamphlets, magazine articles, and several 
books on a single subject, dealing with both sides of the question. 
Two institutions appointed trained librarians last year, making a 
total of 11 in the State. Every month articles concerning libraries 
and library work have appeared in papers and magazines over the 
State. The traveling-library system will go into effect October 1, 
from which great things are expected. 
Vermont has gained 9 town libraries and 2 association libraries, 
making a total of 120 libraries of all sizes. There are 246 towns in 
the State, some of which have two or even three libraries in their 
different villages. Number of towns without libraries, 56. Most of 
these are supplied with the commission’s traveling libraries. More 
branch libraries than ever are doing branch work in the surrounding
-P-A-G-E-372
318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
district schools. More libraries are buying books for the younger 
children. 
An encouraging increase of circulation and appropriation is reported 
throughout the State. The commission now does its work on $6,200 
a year, of which $1,800 is given in books as annual aid to libraries in 
small towns and $200 in books is given to four State institutions. 
Towns that vote to establish town libraries may receive $100 worth 
of books. That appropriation this year amounts to $900. Sixteen 
rural schools and teachers’ training classes were visited with an 
exhibit of the school traveling libraries and a set of pictures. 
The Wisconsin Free Library Commission is organized and adminis- 
tered through four departments; one department engaged in establish- 
ing, organizing and maintaining public libraries; one conducting the 
traveling library work of the State; one an instructional department, 
including the Library School of Wisconsin and the legislative reference 
department. The library commission prepares and issues publica- 
tions of special value. These include the library bulletin, book lists, 
and legislative reference library bulletins. The subjects covered by 
some of the lists recently issued are: Children’s books, sociological 
material free or easily obtained, farm bulletins, civic advance and 
improvement, the monetary question, use of the library in schools, 
anthologies, home economics, income tax, etc. Six hundred and nine 
communities are served by the traveling libraries. There are 100 
small communities not yet in touch with the traveling libraries. 
In addition to the traveling library and the summer schools, 
Michigan has provided instructors for various teachers’ meetings 
and library clubs. Exhibits of reproductions of paintings and stat- 
uary have been sent throughout the State. A traveling exhibit was 
taken by the State librarian on the educational train that traversed 
the southern peninsula, showing the exhibit through the various 
colleges, technical and agricultural. The library commission reports 
that 105,000 books were sent out in two years by traveling libraries. 
During the past year 125,000 books have been circulated in this State 
through the traveling libraries to rural schools, granges, farmers’ 
clubs, and other associations, 900 framed pictures were loaned to 
schools, and 3,000 unframed pictures to women’s clubs. 
PACKAGE LIBRARIES. 
Package libraries are the most recent development of traveling 
libraries. They are designed to meet the demands of students and 
investigators distant from a large collection of books. They contain 
material on serious topics only and are sent to schools, colleges, clubs, 
and debating societies. The subjects are usually social science, 
economics, good roads, conservation, morality and ethics in all phases. 
Package libraries are operated either through the extension division  
-P-A-G-E-373
LIBRARY ACTIVITIBS DURING 1912-13. 319 
of the library commissions or through the traveling-library depart- 
ments of State libraries. Wisconsin, New York, Oregon, and North 
Carolina have introduced them freely. 
LIBRARY LEGISLATION. 
Alabama.—By the consolidation of several small municipalities 
with the city of Birmingham, the question of the library systems for 
the greater Birmingham presented itself. Several free public libraries 
already i in operation were brought within the new city limits. In 
April, 1913, a comprehensive ordinance was adopted by the board of 
city commissioners, organizing a complete library system. This is 
not yet in operation (October, 1913). 
Arizona.—Arizona established a system of district. libraries to be 
under the control of the school trustees and to be free to all pupils of 
school age; 3 per cent of the school funds will be set aside for library 
purposes, and special donations may be made in addition to this. 
Arkansas.—An effort to have a library commission established in 
Arkansas, at the last session of the legislature, did not carry. The 
governor, however, appointed an honorary board of library commis- 
sioners which will undertake the work of traveling libraries, furnish 
advice and direction in establishing public libraries, and strive to 
create a sentiment in favor of State supervision of library extension. 
California.—The bond issue for the proposed State library building, 
which is to cost about $1,500,000, was approved by the legislature of 
1913 and will be voted on by the people in November, 1914. The 
notable feature of the work in California has been the cooperation 
with the schools. Very largely the rural districts in the counties are 
becoming branches of the county free library, receiving complete 
library service; 55 school districts joined the county free library 
during the past year. The appropriation for county libraries was 
$176,239. Since June, 1912, four counties have established libraries. 
In Los Angeles County 6,600 books are sent out in the county through 
about ten different branches. There are now 21 county free libraries, 
1 district library, 3 high-school district libraries, 127 city tax-sup- 
ported libraries, 66 law libraries, 326 libraries in educational institu- 
tions. In addition there are 608 branches and deposit stations in 
connection with the above libraries. 
Delaware-—The appropriation for the State library commission 
was doubled. A large part of the increase will be devoted to book- 
wagon routes in rural Delaware. This is a part of the traveling 
library work. 
Indiana.—An important bill which failed to pass the legislature 
provided for the organization of the libraries in the State under one 
general law. The legislative reference bureau was separated from 
the State library. An appropriation of $13,500 was made for salaries 
   
-P-A-G-E-374
320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
and expenses for the new bureau in addition to the appropriation 
previously made to the legislative reference department of the State 
library. The State library appropriation was increased by $4,280. 
The appropriation of the State library commission was increased 
$2,500; it will now have $12,500 annually. The library provision in 
the law for a commission form of government was found, indefinite 
and unsatisfactory, and a bill was passed by the legislature fixing the 
number of library trustees in commission-governed cities at five and 
giving to them all the powers given to library trustees under the 
general library law of the State. The maximum of the library tax 
levy was raised to 5 mills for all towns. The township library-exten- 
sion law was amended and now extends the benefit of free public 
libraries not only to townships and small towns, but to counties and 
school corporations. It authorizes a levy tax by any of these to 
carry out the provision of a contract which may be made with the 
nearest public library. Such contract must be for a period of five 
years. When a majority of the taxpayers in either county, town, 
small town or school corporation vote in favor of such a contract 
it must be made. A tax was authorized for library purposes on un- 
platted lands within city limits. 
Indiana has 106 library buildings, of which 17 were erected in the 
past two years. Of 1,443,099 people who live in cities and incorpo- 
rated towns, 1,005,097 are served from public or traveling libraries. 
Of the 1,257,700 people who live outside of incorporated towns, only 
106,965 have public or traveling library service. 
Kansas.—The legislature passed an act providing for the establish- 
ment of a public library in any city. Upon the written request of 50 
taxpayers, the matter shall be submitted to the legal voters. The 
library shall be established if the majority of votes are in favor. 
Massachusetts.—A bill was passed authorizing the library commis- 
sion to appoint a director of library work for aliens. The commission 
selected Miss J. Maud Campbell, who had already been active in edu- 
cational work with foreigners. The appropriation for library aid to 
small towns was increased from $2,000 to $4,000. State publications 
will no longer be sent to libraries unless requested. 
Michigan.—A law was passed which requires district school officers 
to select books for township and district libraries from a list prepared 
by the State superintendent of public instruction and the State 
librarian. 
Minnesota.—An appropriation of $500,000 was made by the legisla- 
ture for the erection of a building to house the Historical Society, 
State law library, and the Supreme Court. The library commission 
will be quartered in the new building. 
A law was passed authorizing any county, town, city, or village 
board to make a working contract with any existing public library.
-P-A-G-E-375
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1912-13, 821 
The limit of tax levy was raised. Any school board may agree with 
the board of the nearest approved library to become a branch of said 
library, and shall, in case of such agreement, pay to such public 
library a stipulated sum for the library aid to which the school district 
is entitled. 
Montana.—The legislature of 1913 failed to pass an act estab- 
lishing a State library commission, and also a bill for county exten- 
sion by city libraries. However, the larger libraries do loan books 
to teachers in rural schools, ranchers, and responsible peoplé who 
comply with the library rules. All discarded books and such books 
as can be obtained by gift are given to small struggling libraries by 
the large libraries. The libraries in the larger towns cooperate with 
county workers, and books required by the teachers’ reading circles 
are kept in most of them. 
Nebraska.—A law was enacted providing for a retirement fund for 
librarians in cities of the metropolitan class. The establishment of 
township and county libraries was authorized. Several counties 
have already organized libraries; Lancaster County was the first. 
Nevada.—A new law provides that the State board of education 
shall adopt lists of books for district libraries. 
New Jersey —The administration of the public school libraries of 
the State was transferred to the public library commission. The 
commissioner of education was added to that commission. One copy 
of every publication of the State shall be sent to each public library, 
including historical societies. Two foreign investigators employed 
by the New Jersey immigration commission are assisting the public 
library commission by reviewing lists, discussing the conditions and 
methods of the foreign population of the State, and making recom- 
mendations for future service. 
North, Carolina.—The State library received an increase in its ap- 
propriation, which is now $3,000 a year. 
North Dakota.—The legislature placed the library commission in 
the budget along with the elective State offices, an act which shows 
the growing appreciation of the library commission. Depository sta- 
tions in State institutions make the books of the commission 
available. 
South Carolina.—School districts may use 3 per cent of the annual 
school tax for the provision and maintenance of libraries. 
South Dakota.—An act establishing a free-library commission was 
passed. The State library is placed in the custody of the commis- 
sion, and it is made the headquarters for the library work of the 
State. An appropriation of $4,000 a year was made for the com- 
mission. An act was passed providing that public libraries may be 
established by a majority of those voting on the question, to be 
17726°—xp 1918—voL 1——21

supported by a tax, not to exceed 2 mills, levied by the trustees 
appointed. 
Tennessee.—The State board of education supersedes the State 
board of library commissioners, assuming all its powers and duties, 
except its system of traveling libraries, which has been placed under 
the direction of the State library. Free public libraries, as well as 
public school libraries, are now under the general supervision of the 
State board of education. State financial aid will be granted to 
public school libraries. 
Texas.—An. act providing for the creation of farmers’ county pub- 
lic libraries was passed. Upon the petition of 100 or more legal 
voters, the proposition for such a library shall be submitted to the 
voters in the county. If the majority are in favor, libraries shall 
be established and organized for the purpose of gathering informa- 
tion on agricultural, horticultural, and kindred subjects and shall 
make such information available for use. 
COOPERATION. 
Nearly 40 of the States have library clubs which meet at Jeast 
once a year; some of them meet more frequently. In addition, 
there are local library clubs in the large cities. These are conducted 
for the mutual interest of the members and for a careful study of the 
environments of the libraries concerned, with a view to better 
service and for the prevention of duplication of effort. Among 
those doing the most active work are the New York Library club, 
the Long Island Library club, Pennsylvania Library club of Phila- 
delphia, Library club of the District of Columbia, the Rochester 
Library club, the Chicago Library club, the Milwaukee Library club, 
and the Twin Cities Library club. 
The library associations, and librarians in general, are attempting 
to found a basis of friendly and proper cooperation between book- 
sellers and library service. To this end, booksellers of standing are 
invited to address library meetings in order that libraries may under- 
stand the point of view of the bookseller; and in May, 1913, George 
F. Bowerman, librarian of the Carnegie Library, in the District of 
Columbia, gave a very comprehensive address before the American 
Booksellers’ Association. 
The organization of the Boston Cooperative Information Bureau 
has undertaken to bring together as complete information as possible 
in regard to libraries of Boston and vicinity, especially those which 
are noted for special collections. It is understood that this work 
will take on national scope if success attends the initial effort. 
It is the object of the library department of the National Educa- 
tion Association to bring about cooperation between libraries and 
schools. Both in 1912 and in 1913 comprehensive and illuminating
-P-A-G-E-377
  
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DUBING 1912-18. 823 
collections of library material calculated to be helpful to the grades, 
to the high schools, to the normal schools, and to the colleges were 
exhibited at the annual meetings of the National Education Associa- 
tion. 
The Women’s Educational Association cooperates with the public 
library commission of Massachusetts in sending out traveling libra- 
rians. It also cooperates with the commission and the various 
library clubs in Massachusetts to the end that each may make its 
work more effective in its particular field. 
The New York Public Library actively cooperates with local 
educational, library, and welfare associations by allowing those organi- 
zations to use the assembly and club rooms in its branch buildings for 
their regular meetings. This is particularly helpful to classes for the 
study of English by foreigners and for the meeting of foreign societies. 
An important phase of cooperation is the system of interlibrary 
loans between universities, colleges, and public libraries in the 
Middle West. The universities of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minne- 
sota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, 
and Wisconsin; and Northwestern, Ohio State, and Purdue Univer- 
sities, Adelbert College, the public libraries of Chicago, St. Louis, 
Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Grand Rapids, and the John 
Crerar and Newberry Libraries of Chicago reported effective work 
in 1912-13. The number of volumes handled in these ‘interlibrary 
loans last year was 1,748. In St. Louis the City Art Museum sent 
a small collection of its best recent acquisitions for exhibition in the 
art room of the public library. 
The Drama League in various parts of the country is in close touch 
with the public libraries; over 73 libraries are represented in its 
membership and keep on file the league literature. The league has 
been particularly helpful in recommending plays for children and in 
assisting in their production locally. 
Business and professional workers demand high efficiency in library 
service. To secure technical information with a minimum of expen- 
diture of time and effort is a need which the library must meet. It is, 
therefore, the librarian’s duty to place the necessary books and other 
material within easy access of professional and business men and yet 
insure the safety of all books purchased with public money. Some 
public libraries, in order to meet these demands, have instituted 
municipal reference and technical departments and collections of 
special material. In the municipal reference department the material 
is of interest to the various departments of municipalities showing 
what has been done in other places in the administration of municipal 
affairs, streets, lighting, relation of public utilities, etc. Sometimes 
this collection is placed in the city hall with a trained worker in 
charge, and sometimes it is in the library building. The following
-P-A-G-E-378
824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
cities have municipal reference departments in their public libraries: 
Brooklyn, Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, Fort Wayne, Kansas City, 
Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland (Oreg.), 
Seattle. In New York City there is a municipal reference library, which 
is not a part of the public library proper; it was established in 1913. 
Special technical departments are usually for the use of the manu- 
facturers and mechanical workers. Periodicals, reports, etc., of the 
various industries are collected, catalogued, and made available. 
Special material, dealing with civic and social problems of every kind 
and degree, is in many cases made available also for the use for 
students, teachers, investigators, etc. 
In State libraries legislative reference departments are growing in 
numbers and usefulness. As an important division of this work, 
a bill-drafting department is sometimes provided, in which legislators 
may find assistance and information concerning the experience of 
other States and countries along similar lines. 
Legislative reference departments have been established in Ala- 
bama, California, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North 
Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Wash- 
ington, and Wisconsin. Their aim is to put within convenient reach 
of the legislator, in classified and condensed form, information 
relating to the economic conditions in the other States, to the laws 
there in force, and to the manner in which those laws meet the condi- 
tions that called for their enactment. Their work has had a decided 
effect upon the legislation of the States in which they have been 
established. 
The smaller public libraries are becoming social centers in their 
respective communities, particularly in industrial communities. If 
the library has an auditorium its influence is greatly enhanced. 
Reading clubs, debating clubs, or other organizations with a serious 
purpose are invited to utilize the library for their meetings, and are 
assisted as far as practicable in attaining their objects. Branch 
libraries in large cities are effective in bringing books into the lives 
of many people who otherwise would not come in contact with them. 
Many college libraries are buying special collections in this country 
and Europe to supplement their general collections and to contribute 
more effectively to study and research. 
Many commercial houses have established business libraries, not 
so much of books as of printed reports, pamphlets, etc., together 
with graphic material. The important part in such work is per- 
formed by the trained librarian who is able effectively to use the 
collection under his charge and to supplement it with special infor- 
mation from the technical and special collections of larger libraries. 
Jn this way the book is becoming an everyday tool for the everyday 
   
-P-A-G-E-379

man. The past year saw great advancement along this line in 
Boston, Chicago, New York, and other cities. _ 
EFFICIENCY RECORDS AND PENSIONS. 
  Two important factors in the success of library service are effi- 
ciency records and pensions. It is the consensus of opinion among 
library administrators that municipal civil-service rules as applied 
to libraries are detrimental, rather than helpful. The conduct of 
libraries on the basis of efficiency records gives better satisfaction. 
In this way good service is recognized. Commensurate salaries are 
stimulants in securing adequately skilled service. 
Pensions for librarians have been widely discussed, and some progress 
has been made. Chicago and Buffalo have library pension systems, 
and the Nebraska Legislature in 1913 provided a retirement fund for 
librarians, which is the first legislative action taken in regard to the 
matter. 
The New York Public Library, through recommendations of its 
medical officer, last year made rules looking to the protection and 
development of the health of its employees. These are mainly as 
follows:   
The daily recess period for meals shall be one hour. Every employee is required 
to take the full hour off duty. No employee shall be permitted to make up lost 
time or do library work during the recess hour. The librarians and assistant librarians 
will be required to work but 40 hours each week, exclusive of the recess period. The 
same schedule will be in force summer and winter. 
INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES. 
The use of books as remedial agencies in institutions for defectives 
and delinquents is a work that is gaining approval. The New York 
State Library Association is in close touch with the penal and reform 
institutions of the State, and is rendering effective service. The 
New York Library Club, in connection with the libraries of Greater 
New York and the School of Civics and Philanthropy, is doing 
effective work for that community. 
The institutional libraries of the State of Oregon are under the 
advisory care of the State library. During the year a new library 
has been bought for the industrial school and the prison library was 
extended. 
In New Jersey the library commission has supervision of all insti- 
tutional libraries. 
In Nebraska, the institutional libraries were given to the care of 
the Nebraska library commission by an act of the legislature in 1911. 
The report of 1912 shows a splendid organization, with results that 
are much appreciated by all concerned, especially by those in the 
penal institutions.
-P-A-G-E-380
  326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In Indiana, the library commission on its own initiative is gradually 
organizing and developing the libraries in a dozen or more State 
institutions. 
In Minnesota, the board of control has but recently taken up the 
work for the State institutions, and has again secured the services of 
Miriam E. Carey, to further develop it for the entire State. Similar 
work has been conducted for several years in Iowa. 
“X list of a thousand books for hospitals” has been issued by the 
American Library Association publishing board. The list was 
originally prepared by Edith K. Jones; additions and annotations 
have been made by Miriam E. Carey, supervisor of institutional 
libraries in Minnesota; Florence Waugh, librarian of institutional 
libraries for Nebraska; and Julia Robinson, supervisor of institu- 
tional library work for Iowa. 
LIBRARY SCHOOLS. 
Efficient library schools are maintained by the following institu- 
tions: 
Simmons College, Boston, June R. Donnelly, director. 
New York Public Library, New York City, Mary Wright Plummer, principal. 
Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, N. Y., Edward F. Stevens, director; Josephine A. Rath- 
bone, vice director, in charge of school. 
Drexel Institute, Philadelphia, Pa., Corinne Bacon, director. 
New York State Library, Albany, N. Y., James I. Wyer, jr., director. 
Carnegie Library, Pittsburgh, Pa., Susan ©. N. Bogle, director (for children’s libra- 
rians). 
Carnegie Library, Atlanta, Ga., Mrs. Percival Sneed, director. 
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, Alice 8. Tyler, director. 
University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., Mary E. Hazeltine, director. 
University of Illinois, Urbana, Ill., P. L. Windsor, director. 
Syracuse University, Syracuse, N. Y., E. E. Sperry, director. 
In addition to these there are training classes in many of the large 
libraries, intended primarily to train their own employees. Such 
classes are maintained by the libraries of Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago, 
St. Louis, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia. 
Many of the State library commissions hold summer terms for library 
training, to which only those already in library service are admitted. 
The demand for well-trained assistants exceeds the supply. 
The New York State Library, as a result of the demand for its own 
workers in that line, has instituted a course in. law and legislative 
reference. 
Wisconsin’s experience has been similar, and the Wisconsin Library 
School now offers to graduates of accredited colleges and universities 
a full year’s course in library administration and public service. 
The course is offered to meet the demands for sociological libraries, 
workers in law, municipal affairs, and libraries connected with indus-
-P-A-G-E-381
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1912-13. 327 
trial commissions, boards of public utilities, commercial houses, 
manufacturing plants, etc. About one-third of the course will be 
given to bibliographic and technical training and two-thirds to 
library technique. 
The course for school librarians offered for several years by the 
School of Education, University of Chicago, was discontinued in 
1913; 
Pratt Institute School of Library Science offers a normal course for 
graduates of standard library schools who may wish to prepare for 
teaching library economy and administration. 
A recent report on bibliographic instruction in colleges, made by 
Mr. Willard Austen, of Cornell University, to the New York State 
Library Association, contains the following: 
Out of about 200 institutions to whom inquiries were sent, 165 replied. Most of 
these, ag to be expected, reported that students were given individual help in using 
the library wherever opportunity offered; 84 reported that no courses of instruction 
are offered in any of these subjects; 38 reported introductory lectures given at the 
beginning of the college year, chiefly to introduce freshmen to the use of the library; 
36 reported some courses running through the half year, sometimes the whole year; 
23 reported instruction in the technical subjects, such as classification, cataloging, 
etc.; 37 offer courses dealing with general reference books. At 11 institutions instruc- 
tion in paleography may be had, and the same number give courses in the history of 
printing, bookmaking, etc. At only one place could it be figured out that courses 
were offered in the literature of special subjects, and this was probably due to the 
fact that instruction at that place was largely of a special-subject character. At none 
of our collegiate institutions, except at those where library school courses were open 
to the general student body, can a student get instruction in all the subjects that go 
to make up a well-rounded course in bibliography for the general literary worker. 
Even the large universities, where nearly everything else is included in the curricu- 
lum, signally fail in offering instruction in most of these subjects. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. 
The 1913 conference of the Anterican Library Association was held 
at Kaaterskill, N. Y., June 23-28. There were 892 persons regis- 
tered. 
President Legler’s address on the subject “The world of print 
and the world’s work” reviewed the evolution of the book and traced 
its influence in the unfoldment of human, rights. 
Mr. Carnegie, in response to a request to name what he considered 
the most valuable accomplishment of the public-library movement in 
the past decade, replied: ‘The spread of the truth that the public 
library, free to all the people, gives nothing for nothing; that the 
reader must himself climb the ladder, and in climbing gain knowl- 
edge how to live this life well.” 
The Library Association of Great Britain, at the request of the 
American Library Association, sent an official delegate in the person 
of Mr. L. Stanley Jast, librarian of the Croydon Public Libraries and 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  328 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
honorary secretary of the British association. Mr. Jast addressed 
the American Library Association on ‘Present conditions and ten- 
dencies in library work in Great Britain.” 
Among other speakers from outside the ranks of the association 
were Mary Antin, the author of ‘The Promised Land,’ who spoke 
on “The immigrant in the library”; and the Hon. George McAneny, 
president of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, who gave an 
address on ‘“‘The municipal reference library as an aid in city ad- 
ministration.” 
The general theme of the conference was ‘Specialization in library 
work,” and among the topics grouped under this head and discussed 
in papers were the following: Work with foreigners and colored races; 
work among artisans and craftsmen; work among rural communities, 
especially dealing with woman on the farm; dependents and defec- 
tives in penal and charitable institutions; work with children and 
young people in the home, in the school, and in the library; munici- 
pal and legislative reference library work; library work for business 
men in the public libraries and in libraries of business organizations. 
One of the most significant papers at section meetings was that on 
_ “Tnstruction in the use of a college library,” by Miss Lucy M. Sal- 
mon, professor of history at Vassar; significant, not only in the 
address itself, but also in the selection of the topic by the college 
and reference section, as a hopeful indication that eyes are turning 
toward this vital subject and that the importance of teaching college 
students how to use the resources of their library is to receive the 
consideration it most assuredly merits. 
Mr. E. H. Anderson, director of the New York Public Library, 
was elected president for the coming year, and Mr. Hiller C. Well- 
man, librarian of Springfield, Mass., and Miss Gratia A. Country- 
man, librarian of Minneapolis, first and second vice presidents, 
respectively. : 
The committee on library administration has continued its studies 
of methods used in certain libraries in accessioning and charging 
books. This study is being conducted with.a view to eliminate any 
possible unnecessary steps and perform the entire process with 
greater efficiency and less expense. 
The committee appointed in 1912 to investigate the cost and meth- 
ods of cataloging is attempting to render a similar service in this 
department of library technique. A preliminary report was pre- 
sented at the Kaaterskill conference. 
The committee appointed about 18 months ago to investigate the 
relations that should exist between the municipal authorities and the 
public library made a further report at Kaaterskill, in which they 
reiterated their former conviction that the public library is an edu- 
cational institution and that education is a matter of State rather

than local concern. This view received strong official support in a 
decision recently rendered by the Supreme Court of Michigan to the 
effect that, while municipalities are recognized under the local- 
government article, the public schools, libraries, etc., are under the 
educational article. The Supreme Court of Michigan, having under 
consideration the right of the city of Detroit to issue bonds for library 
purposes to an amount over and above the limit applying to bond 
issue for general municipal purposes, held that no such, restriction 
applies in case of the library bond issues, as they properly fall in the 
same class as school bonds. 
The committee’s report emphasized, among other positions which 
the public library should hold, the following: 
(1) The right by simple and easy methods for any public taxing or governing body 
to establish a free public library and to tax the community for its support; (2) admin- 
istration of the library by an independent board of trustees rather than a single com- 
missioner, and in particular not by a commissioner who has other matters on his hands. 
with other educational agencies, and in no case treated as a group of buildings, or as In case, however, such ene of affairs is necessary, the library should be placed 
a mere agency of recreation; 3) the disposition of all funds of the library, including 
those from taxation, by the ene of the library untrammeled by other authorities 
of the municipality; (4) oper: tion of the library on the merit system, in the same way 
that the schools are operated—not by placing the selection of library employees in 
the hands of the same board. 
ments, but by requiring that 
system of service satisfactory that selects clerks and mechanics for the cityy depart- 
the library board establish and carry out an efficient 
o the proper authorities. 
For the help of ae in States which have no adequate library 
laws the committee fra: ed a series of provisions that could, after 
adaptation to local conditions, be incorporated in a city charter to 
form part of the section dealing with the government of the public 
library. These are printed in the proceedings of the Kaaterskill 
meeting. 
A committee headed by Mr. Frank P. Hill, librarian of the Brook- 
lyn Public Library, has been for nearly three years engaged in a study 
of a better quality of ne ‘ws-print paper and possible remedies. The 
recommendations of this committee, presented at the January, 1913, 
  meeting of the council 
printed inthe January bu of the American Library Association and 
letin of the association, include the following: 
(1) Volumes of newspapers printed since 1880 should be painted on the edges with 
“Gellit,”? an American product prepared by the Chemical Product Co., of Boston, or 
a similar preparation. 
(2) The volumes should be kept flat, with air space around them, and should not be 
exposed to sunlight. 
(3) Current numbers should be bound as soon as the volume is completed. 
(4) Librarians should endeavor to induce local newspaper publishers to print a 
special library edition on a 75 per cent rag paper. 
Several newspapers have already undertaken the printing of a 
special library edition on a better quality of paper.

330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Cooperation with the National Education Association was empha- 
sized and furthered by that organization’s invitation to the American 
Library Association to appoint an official delegate to appear on their 
main program at the Chicago meeting in July, 1912. Dr. Arthur E. 
Bostwick, librarian of the St. Louis Public Library, was appointed 
and delivered an address on ‘‘The public school and the social center 
movement.” 
The policy has been continued of encouraging State library asso- 
ciations to place representatives of the American Library Association, 
on the program of their annual meetings. President Legler was the 
official representative of the association at the Ohio meeting, the 
Ilinois-Missouri joint meeting, and the South Dakota State meeting. 
Secretary Utley represented the association at the Illinois-Missouri 
meeting and at the Oklahoma State meeting. Dr. Arthur E. Bost- 
wick, an ex-president of the association, was its representative at the 
State meetings in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. Mr. T. W. 
Koch, a member of the executive board, represented the association 
at the Indiana State meeting. 
With the June number of the Booklist, the association’s official 
magazine devoted to the subject of book selection, Miss Elva L. 
Bascom severed her five years’ connection as editor, and Miss May 
Massee, of the Buffalo Public Library, was elected editor. A further 
change in the editorial work of the Booklist has been effected by the 
transfer of the editorial offices from Madison, Wis., to Chicago, near 
the headquarters office of the American Library Association. The 
advantages of this change of base are already apparent in the increased 
number of books which publishers send to the Booklist office for 
review and in the larger corps of expert collaborators found in a 
large city. 
Activities at the headquarters office in Chicago have continued 
steadily to increase, correspondence being conducted with librarians, 
library commissions, and library trustees in all sections of the United 
States and Canada, and to a lesser extent in all parts of the world. 
The membership of the association has been increased during the last 
year by a net gain of 168, the present total membership being now 
2,533. 
AMERICAN LIBRARY INSTITUTE. 
The American Library Institute held its regular meeting at the 
Hotel Kaaterskill, N. Y., June 25, 1913. 
The cost of administration came before the institute for informal 
discussion. It was held by the committee that the conditions in 
different libraries are so unlike, and conditions in the same library 
are so different at different times, that it is not possible to say how 
much of the library income any of the different demands should 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1912-13. 331 
absorb. It was held by some that there is a basis somewhere on 
which might be obtained uniformity of statistics. 
Mr. William Dawson Johnston, of New York City, gave an address 
on “The Need of Specialization in Library Service.” 
Mr. Johnston’s thesis held that there should be a distinction be- 
tween bibliographers and clerks in library service, and that there 
should also be differentiation of function among bibliographers. He 
advocated, also, securing the service of experts from allied institu- 
tions or from independent scholars resident in the community. ° 
Dr. John Thomson, of Philadelphia, presented an address on 
“The Pleasures of being a Librarian.” .He illustrated his topic by 
pointing out curious, humorous, and impossible entries in various 
standard indexes. 
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT. 
An investigation of this subject by Charles S. Greene shows the 
whole matter of the relation to the municipality to be an extremely 
important subject in view of the number of towns and cities that are 
adopting new charters of this sort. 
The earliest commission charters were adopted in southern cities 
and in smaller towns, where the library had not assumed the relative 
importance assigned to it in other places, so that the first commission 
charters gave scant consideration to the question. Those charters 
have been followed, often rather blindly, by many larger cities. In 
some charters the library is under the complete control of one com- 
missioner. In other cities library boards have been discontinued and 
the librarian reports directly to the commission or to some one com- 
missioner. In some the effective control of the staff is put in the 
hands of a civil-service commission. In most the method of library 
support is left uncertain and generally inadequate.

SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
The number of public high-school libraries in the United States is 
10,329, containing 6,185,937 volumes. Number of private high 
schools, 1,405, containing 2,443,880 volumes. 
WIDENER MEMORIAL LIBRARY. 
Perhaps the greatest interest in university libraries for the year 
centers around the proposed new library for Harvard, the Widener 
Memorial Library. The cornerstone was laid June, 1913, and the 
plans for the future library are full of promise. The splendid col- 
lections of Harvard will have ample room, and the special collections 
will be made available in a way not possible heretofore. There will 
be provided throughout the greater part of the stacks small stalls for 
individual readers where one may keep his books and papers and 
work continuously from day to day in close proximity to the general 
collections on the subject in which he is interested. The card cata- 
logue is being transferred from the old standard size to the present 
standard size of card, and something like 162,000 printed cards have 
been placed in the catalogue. The shelf capacity is estimated at 
2,500,000 volumes, about five times the capacity of the old library. 
The libraries of Harvard University now contain about one million 
books, and a half million pamphlets. 
NECROLOGY. 
‘Death claimed during the year several who had made distinct con- 
tributions to the development of library service. Foremost among 
these were: 
Dr. John Shaw Billings, librarian of the New York Public Library, who died March 11, 
1913. 
Charles Carroll Soule, library trustee of Brookline, Mass., and an authority on library 
architecture, January 7, 1913. 
Walter Kendall Jewett, librarian of the University of Nebraska, March 3, 1913. 
Charles A. Larson, editor of the publications of the Chicago Public Library, August 
19, 1913. 
Clarence W. Ayer, librarian of the public library of Cambridge, Mass., April 12, 1913. 
Bertha S. Wildman, of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, February 19, 1913. 
EXPANSION IN LARGE CITIES.' 
Atlanta.—This library turns into the city treasury the fines and fees 
of the library, which last year amounted to $1,577.20. Small depos- 
its of books have been placed in associations and commercial insti-   
1 From reports of the libraries, unless otherwise noted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-388
  334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
tutions, and 1,000 books have been loaned to the schools; a number 
of free lectures and attractive exhibits were held at the building 
during the year. 
Baltimore.—The Enoch:Pratt Free Library, of Baltimore, records a 
circulation for the year of 706,222. There are 17 branches in the 
city, with 300,000 volumes on the shelves. The administration of 
the library cost the past year $88,932.13. A new departure has been 
an attempt to have good literature read aloud to the public in the 
branch libraries. 
Boston.—Boston Public Library has occupied one new branch build- 
ing, costing, with its site, $86,000—a model branch building. Two 
other branch buildings are approaching completion. One in Charles- 
town will cost $72,200, and the other, in East Boston, $100,000, 
including in each case the cost of the site and equipment. Branch 
reading rooms in municipal buildings in different parts of the city are 
being provided. Two noteworthy groups of statuary flanking the 
principal entrance to the main library building, one representing art 
and the other science, the work of Bela L. Pratt, sculptor, have been 
put into position during the year. 
The number of volumes sent on deposit from the central library 
through the branch system was 42,587, of which 11,432 were sent to 
schools. There were also sent from the branches themselves and 
from two of the largest reading rooms 25,654 volumes on deposit, 
distributed among 153 places. Of these, 20,056 were sent to schools. 
Not only is the collection of the central library used as a reservoir 
from which books may be drawn for use in the branches and reading 
rooms, but each of the branches and reading rooms is in itself a res- 
ervoir from which books are drawn for use by teachers in schools in 
its immediate vicinity. Books were supplied the public through 28 
branches and reading rooms, deposits in 31 public and parochial 
schools, 61 engine houses, and 31 other institutions. 
Brooklyn —The Brooklyn public library consists of 28 branches, 
3 stations, 9 deposit stations, 11 factory stations, 3 stations in depart- 
ment stores, and 275 institutions to which traveling libraries are 
issued; 17 of the branches are housed in buildings erected from money 
given by Mr. Carnegie. So rapid has been the development of the 
communities where most of these branches have been erected that 
several are taxed to their utmost capacity. 
Ground was broken for the new central library building of Brooklyn, 
and several new deposit stations were opened. 
The library work with children is one of the most important activi- 
ties undertaken. The ‘Books for boys and girls” and “The child’s 
own library” are in the second edition, and requests for copies come 
from all parts of the country and often from abroad. A system of 
traveling libraries was organized for active service to all Brooklyn
-P-A-G-E-389
  LIBRARY ACTIVITIES DURING 1912-13, 335 
police stations, fire departments, railroad terminals, and a large 
number of commercial and manufacturing institutions. Schools, 
both public and private, are in close connection with the children’s 
department. 
Buffalo, N. Y.—A plan of cooperation between the Public Library, 
Academy of Science, Art Museum, Historical Society, the public 
schools, and the Grosvenor Library, entered upon the last year, has 
resulted in a better understanding of and a greater improvement in 
the field of work common to these institutions. 
A bequest in the will of a former citizen was “given to the Buffalo 
public library in acknowledgement of many happy hours spent there.” 
The libraries for the keepers of lighthouses in the Buffalo district 
have been supervised by request made by the lighthouse inspector. 
A pamphlet was issued describing the Buffalo system of public 
school and public library cooperation, by Mrs. H. L. Elmendorf, and 
it was found extremely useful. : 
Printed lists were sent to the pupils of the graduating class of the 
grammar schools, urging their continued use of the library, and to 
10,000 students of the night schools, calling attention to the oppor- 
tunities offered by the public library. Direct results were observed 
in demands for books upon the trades. 
The library took part in the child’s welfare exhibit, and by means of 
display cards and photographs, on exhibition of books for children, 
classroom libraries used in the public schools, the work of the library 
with the children of Buffalo made a most interesting showing. 
Chicago. Chicago Public Library—During the year, the twenty- 
sixth circulating branch was opened at Holstein Park. A civics 
room, covering every phase of social and political activity, was opened 
in the main library. The municipal reference library in the city hall 
passed under the control of the public library. The library service 
was maintained through 487 agencies, including 26 branches, 87 
delivery stations, 23 deposit stations in business houses, and 342 
schools. : 
Chicago. The John Crerar Library—The principal event of the 
year was the acquisition of property, 135 feet on Michigan Avenue 
and 128 feet on Randolph Street, as a site for a new building. This 
will provide a central location which the directors are convinced will 
develop the greatest usefulness of the institution. As 1916 is the 
earliest date at which the building can be ready for occupancy, the 
library has made arrangements to continue in their present quarters 
until then. 
Chicago. Newberry Library.—The board has lost one of its charter 
members, Gen. E. C. Newberry, who died July 20,1912. The library 
was the recipient of a number of valuable gifts during the year. A 
number of exhibitions of material have been held during the year.  
-P-A-G-E-390
    336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Two special publications, the Asiatic and Turkish manuscripts 
described by Duncan B. McDonald, D. D., and a list of books and 
manuscripts on “Captivity among the Indians in North America,” 
in the E. E. Ayer collection. 
Cincinnati—A teachers’ room was opened in the public library, 
having on its shelves a collection of the best children’s books, arranged 
by grades, material on children’s literature, courses of study in pub- 
lic school systems of various cities, books on story telling, and subjects 
of interest to teachers. 
Courses of lectures have been given on children’s literature and 
library work with children, in the college for teachers and in the 
kindergarten training school. : 
Two new branches in Carnegie buildings were opened. The issue 
of books through the branch department showed an increase of 
104,000 over the preceding year, with increased growth in registra- 
tion figures. In the municipal benefit exhibit the work was brought 
to the attention of the public by a large wall map and a collection 
of 60 pictures. 
A city civics room was opened, where special attention will be given 
to students of social questions of the day. The collection in this 
room consists of books, current periodicals, clippings, classified and 
arranged on shelves in boxes. The number of letters translated for 
patrons was doubled. 
Cleveland, Ohio.—The Cleveland public library’s collection numbers 
over half a million volumes, which were used by a million and a half 
visitors who came to the library to read or do reference work. The 
circulation for reference work was over two and a half million vol- 
umes. A bond issue of $2,000,000 for a new library building, which 
will form part of the civic center, was voted in May, 1913. For the 
purpose of furthering the usefulness of the branches, a representative 
committee of citizens was organized. 
In 1913, for the first time, a special plan of work was inaugurated 
with public night schools and with all other regularly organized 
evening classes and it met with great success. A training class for 
children’s librarians was established January, 1913. 
Denver.—The report of the Denver public library records 135,263 
volumes in the library, with a circulation of 184,397 volumes through 
the main library, 4 branches, and 20 distributing stations. Number 
of cards in force, 28,905; total appropriation for the year, $83,562. 
An open shelf for the use of teachers was started during the year. 
Four new branch buildings were opened in the spring of 1913. 
Detroit, Mich.—The abolishment of the requirement of a guarantor 
and the extension of privileges to persons living outside the city 
resulted in an addition of 20,973 card holders, giving a total of 73,026. 
An open-shelf room, with 6,000 volumes, was inaugurated. Hight 
 
-P-A-G-E-391

new stations were opened, mostly in commercial institutions, with 
a total circulation from them of 80,674 volumes. Six Carnegie 
branches were arranged for, and five of them were completed, making 
ten branch libraries for the cities. 
A competition for plans for a new main building led to the employ- 
ment of Mr. Cass Gilbert. Plans and contracts for the $1,000,000 
building are under way. The building will be of sufficient dimensions 
and general arrangement to serve for 50 years at least. 
Mr. Henry M. Utley, who had been librarian since 1895, retired 
from active service November 1, 1912, and was made librarian 
emeritus. Mr. Adam Strohm, who had been first assistant librarian 
and acting librarian, was made librarian. 
Houston, Tex.—The Carnegie library contains 35,406 volumes and 
has 13,464 borrowers. A children’s department was opened under a 
trained librarian. Lists of important new books, lists of subjects of 
timely interest—on municipal affairs, technical books, house building 
and furnishing, the best fiction—have been distributed. A special 
service for the various school buildings was started by Miss Calhoun, 
children’s librarian. A lecture course was held during the year. A 
colored branch was opened in April, 1913, from which, in the first. 
month, 3,000 books were loaned. 
Indianapolis.—The general assembly of 1913 passed a law permit- 
ting the issue of bonds for $500,000 by the school board which controls 
the library to erect a library building on the site given by James 
Whitcomb Riley, valued at $100,000. The building will be begun 
within the year. The fifth of the six branch buildings given by Mr. 
Andrew Carnegie was opened during the year. An important change 
in administration is the shortening of the number of hours per week 
from an average of 47 to 40}. This was done by reorganizing the 
working time, with night work and time off to compensate. The 
result is much better service and better feeling among the staff. 
Kansas City—The public library is in process of reorganization, 
being thoroughly reclassified and recatalogued. A new branch build- 
ing was opened March, 1913. Bonds were voted for an addition to 
the central library building and 13 additional branches. Deposit 
stations were established throughout the city and a commercial 
department opened. 
Los Angeles—The number of volumes in the public library is 
224,349. The new city charter which would have abolished the board 
of directors and taken away the assured income of 4-mill assessment 
was defeated. 
A number of exhibits of books have been held in the library through 
the courtesy of the dealers, and talks on children’s books have been 
given before parents’ and teachers’ associations throughout the city.

338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
A series of story hours have been given by the students of the Uni- 
versity of California. Good results on both sides have come from the 
cooperation. A training class of 10 women was prepared for the 
service of the public library. 
A new branch library building, the gift of Mr. Carnegie, was opened. 
About half the circulation was from the branches and deposit stations. 
Minneapolis.—Minneapolis public library opened a new building 
for the Seven Corners branch library; cost, $32,000; added 14 libra- 
ries during 1912, 3 branches, 5 factory libraries, 6 settlement libra- 
ries; received $125,000 from Carnegie Corporation for erection of 4 
branches. 
Nashville, Tenn.—The Carnegie library reports a gift from Mr. 
Carnegie of $50,000 for two branches, one for white people and one 
for colored people. 
New York public library.—There are 1,002 persons on the staff of 
the New York public library. The number of readers registered was 
7,969,664. An average of 1,112 persons made use of the reference 
room daily during the year. The reference department was con- 
ducted during the year at an expense of $433,579, and the circulation 
department at an expense of $661,322. There are 40 persons in the 
circulation department. 
Edwin H. Anderson was appointed director to succeed Dr. John 
Shaw Billings, deceased. 
Newark, N. J.—In Newark the public library has a business branch 
in a building erected for the purpose and leased for five years. The 
library occupies the whole building—two floors, each 37 by 90 feet; 
the first floor on the level with the street, the upper floor with sky- 
lights, 
The library has now no reference department, as the same is ordi- 
narily understood. The lending department includes reference work. 
This plan proves very satisfactory. All fiction has been moved to a 
special room on the first floor; all registration work for the whole 
system has also been removed to a special room on the same floor. 
This relieves the lending room proper of many visitors and much con- 
sequent confusion and makes the general library an admirable place 
for students. 
Most of the upper classes of the grammar grades about to pass into 
the high school are given one lesson, in the library, on the library and 
the use of books. The lessons given by the high-school librarian to 
all high-school classes, as they go through their course, will be modi- 
fied and extended. : 
The library publishes a monthly journal called the “Newarker.” 
Its purpose is to advertise the library in Newark and to make the 
library more useful in its community. The museums of art and 
science owned by the Newark museum association are still housed

in the library building. This association and its collections are both 
outgrowths of the activities of the library in the fields of art and 
science and the work of broadening the interests of Newark citizens. 
One hundred lists of books and seventy stories about collections in 
the department were printed in the local papers, while 300 meetings 
were held in the library building. 
Philadelphia.—The number of volumes in the free library is 415,802, 
with a total circulation of 2,060,499. There-are 4,322 embossed vol- 
umes for the blind, divided among the five types. Cooperation along 
these lines is carried on by the Pennsylvania Home Teaching Society 
and the Pennsylvania Institution for the Blind. A municipal refer- 
ence library was established. A lecture course including 44 lectures, 
with a total attendance of 11,477 and an average attendance of 260, 
was given. 
Pittsburgh.—The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh had its appropria- 
tion increased from $250,000 to $260,000. Seventeen students 
entered the library school, four of whom were graduates of other 
library schools and eight were college graduates. The total number 
of regular students in both classes was 39. The students were from 
14 States. 
Portland, Oreg—The efficiency of the public library has been 
increased by the extension of the hours of opening on Sunday and 
holiday evenings, the organization of the high-school libraries under 
trained assistants, traveling libraries to Sunday schools and clubs, 
and the enlargement of subbranches. 
Over 11,000 persons attended lectures in the auditorium; 1,500 
people used the committee rooms. Two lantern slides were provided 
for the 11 moving-picture theaters. One slide stated that the stories 
of the pictures might be obtained at the central library and the other 
slide gave the location of the central library and branches. The 
slides were shown at performances which included literary films. 
The opening of the new central library building of Portland took 
place September 8, 1913. This is a most important fact in the his- 
tory of the library, in that it is a library building for Multnomah 
County. 
The North Portland branch, costing $35,000, the gift of Mr. Car- 
negie, opened in February; the Gresham branch, costing $12,000, 
also the gift of Mr. Carnegie, was opened March 1; four subbranches, 
at a cost of $60,000, also the gift of Mr. Carnegie, are to form part of 
the system. One at Vernon is opened and work on another has 
begun. Gifts amounting to $30,320 were received from citizens of 
Portland and Multnomah County for branch libraries. The municipal 
reference library was opened in the city hall on April 1. 
Providence, R. I—The work of the public library is handicapped by 
inadequate equipment, both of quarters and appropriation. The 
   
-P-A-G-E-394
    
340 + EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
work with foreign readers has received a notable impetus with the 
important series of lectures at the public library under the direction 
of the immigration education bureau. They were planned for the 
various sections of foreign readers, and covered such subjects as “Our 
political institutions and the demands of the citizen,” “The relations 
of the emigrant to the United States and to his people,” with lectures 
also on prevention of contagious diseases and other sanitary measures, 
child welfare, history of American institutions, National, State, and 
municipal. Many of these were illustrated by stereopticon views. 
St. Joseph, Mo.—At the public library special efforts were made 
during the year to emphasize the practical value of the library for 
professional, business, and employed men of the entire city. Addresses 
before commercial clubs, posters for factories and stations, blotters 
for business men, circulars for advertising men, newspaper stories 
and lists, printed book lists, personal letters, and post card announce- 
ments of the new books, electrical booth display in pure food exhibit, 
home circulars addressed to school children, library slides in moving 
picture theaters, school visits, etc., illustrate some of the year’s ad- 
vertising efforts. 
A circular addressed to each school child more than doubled the 
juvenile registration in one month, and it is believed increased the 
adult registration. An Edison home kinetoscope, for use in the story 
hour, has been a good investment. A new department, called the 
creative department, is given the supervision of compiling reading 
lists, newspaper stories, printed library publicity, bulletins, picture 
collections, and special exhibits. 
An interesting addition during the year was the special’ Eugene 
Field collection of special and rare editions, containing some 125 rare 
items of books, pamphlets, and magazine articles. The Buchanan 
County medical society presented to the library subscriptions for 
20 leading current medical journals. 
St. Louis, Mo.—One night in each month, the public library has 
made a special effort to show the building and the operation of its 
departments to interested citizens. The average attendance has been 
about 100. Use of the assembly rooms by organizations of all sorts 
reached 192 organizations, holding 2,454 meetings, in the central 
library and the six branches. 
Traveling libraries have gone to school stations, classrooms, set- 
tlements, evening schools, homes, playgrounds, commercial and 
industrial institutions, engine houses, etc. An hourly delivery was 
begun in the down town stations in November, and is a part of the 
regular work. 
In November, 1912, a station was opened in a department store 
down town, and an hourly delivery of books was begun. Shoppers

may order books by telephone. This frequency of delivery between 
library and station is a new departure. 
The report of the efficiency engineer employed by the city council 
to investigate the city departments stated that the   
management of the Seattle public library as a whole is admirable, and a return to 
civil service methods would not bring any better results. The library department at 
30 per cent less rates of pay, has built up an organization, distinctly more efficient than 
that of any department under civil service rules. 
Springfield, Mass—The first full year of the new library building 
justified the highest hopes of its usefulness. Its arrangement has 
been found practical; pleasure and comfort are afforded by the 
commodious quarters, and it is praised for its beauty. The grounds 
around the building have been improved and the setting is both 
appropriate and sightly. 
More than one-quarter of the population of Springfield is foreign- 
born. Few classes of books in the library are so largely circulated 
as the foreign books. More than 25,000 books were deposited in the 
various classrooms for the use of the pupils. Systematic instruction 
in use of the library has been given the ninth grade pupils at the 
main building. A special attempt was made last year to increase the 
use of the best books in the library with gratifying results. An in- 
vestigation of the processes and results showed that under normal 
conditions a display of the classics circulated on the average seven 
times as frequently as other books of non-fiction. Other special 
groups of books in the library have been exhibited, and lists of the 
best books of various kinds have been distributed, with gratifying 
success. The number of distributing stations is 334, including 298 
school classrooms and a number of manufacturing and commercial 
concerns. Exhibits of pictures, birds, minerals, plants, and drawings 
have been placed in the branches far off from the main library and 
museum at various times during the year. 
Washington, D. C——The free public library of Washington City 
utilizes 161 agencies for the distribution of books, the central library, 
1 branch, 5 social settlement stations conducted by volunteers, 2 
stations conducted by persons paid by cooperating institutions, the 
District building, 7 public high-school libraries, 3 stations in public 
school buildings, 82 grammar schools, 1 parochial school, 5 private 
schools, the library of Howard University, 6 playground libraries, 
35 home libraries, 4 parents’ associations, 11 fire stations, 1 Camp 
Fire Girls’ group, 3 summer camps, 2 Sunday schools, and 1 mission. 
There are in addition 24 charitable and correctional institutions for 
children and adults to which withdrawn books are sent. Work with 
the schools made a high record and an exhibition of the work with 
the schools held in the fall was an effective help. It attracted much 
attention beyond the local borders. .

The parochial school constitutes the foundation of the Catholic 
educational system in the United States. It was the first of the 
schools established by the church in this country, and now ranks of 
unquestionable importance, for on it depends the organized religious 
education of the people and, in large measure, the success of the 
higher institutions of learning. Its maintenance at present repre- 
sents an annual expenditure conservatively estimated at $11,000,000, 
which is raised by voluntary contributions. 
HISTORICAL SKETCH. 
The parochial school is one of the early forms of Christian schools 
which flourished extensively during the middle ages. In this country 
it is an outgrowth of the mission schools, the earliest of which were 
those of the Spanish Franciscans in Florida and New Mexico, which 
were in existence in 1629, ‘‘four years before the establishment of the 
oldest school in the 13 eastern colonies.” These latter were, conse- 
quently, in the order of foundation, the first elementary schools in 
the present territory of the United States. In the colonial period 
the growth of the parochial schools was commensurate with that of 
the church itself. Dr. Burns, the historian of the Catholic school 
system, says of this period: 
As a matter of fact, the foundation of the Catholic parish-school system in the United 
States dates from the early years of the Maryland colony. It represents, therefore, a 
development covering a period of over 250 years. Broadly speaking, we can distin- 
guish two great periods in its development—the first, extending down to the time of the 
Revolution, and the second, from that epoch-making event to our own day. The 
salient feature of its growth throughout the whole time is its dependence upon the 
growth of the church in general. A direct relation existed between the development

Commis. of Ed., 1903, I, 555. 
343
-P-A-G-E-398
344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of the church and the development of Catholic schools. We can see the proof of 
the existence of this relation during the first period in the fact that wherever Cath- 
olic settlements were formed and Catholic life reached any degree of maturity Catholic 
schools were set up and a corresponding educational development took place. In 
settlements where Catholic life was weak or short-lived, either no schools were estab- 
lished, or those that were had only a short or desultory existence. In the post- 
Revolutionary period the relation is even more clearly illustrated.! 
In the early days of the Republic they were opened as free schools. 
in large cities like Baltimore and New York wherever the parish funds 
allowed. ‘ 
The bishops discussed the parochial school in the First Synod of 
Baltimore, in 1791, and in the First Provincial Council of Baltimore, 
in 1829, they decreed as follows: 
Since it is evident that very many of the young, the children of Catholic parents, 
especially the poor, have been exposed and are still exposed, in many places of this 
province, to great danger of the loss of faith or the corruption of morals, on account cf 
the lack of such teachers as could safely be intrusted with so great an office, we judge 
it absolutely necessary that schools should be established in which the young may he 
taught the principles of faith and morality while being instructed in letters.” 
For a struggling Catholic population it was a tremendous problem 
to provide schools as well as churches, and one of the chief difficulties 
was to obtain Catholic teachers. The introduction of the teaching 
orders, those of men and of women, met this demand, and during the 
immigration period when thousands of Catholics came to America 
from Europe, Ireland and Germany especially, the Sisters and 
Brothers were engaged for the work of the elementary schools. At 
the time of the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, in 1853, despite 
the difficulty of obtaining all the teachers necessary, the bishops were 
exhorted by the council as follows: 
We exhort the bishops, and in view of the grave evils which usually result from the 
defective education of youth, we beseech them through the bowels of the mercy of 
God to see that schools be established in connection with all of the churches of their 
dioceses; and, if it be necessary and circumstances permit, to provide, from the 
revenues of the church to which the school is attached, for the support of competent 
teachers.’ 
In the Second Provincial Council of Cincinnati, held in 1858 (the 
province of Cincinnati extended at that time from the Alleghanies 
to the Mississippi), it was decreed: 
It is the judgment of the Fathers that all pastors of souls are bound, under pain of 
mortal sin, to provide a Catholic school in every parish or congregation subject to them, 
where this can be done; and in order that each Ordinary may know what are the 
parishes in which this obligation exists, they decree that the Tridentine Law, s. xxii, 
c. ix, is to be practically enforced, by which the rectors of churches are required each 
year to render an exact account to their Ordinaries of all the revenues accruing to their

churches in any way, which they therefore strictly enjoin as to be observed by the 
aforesaid rectors.1 
In 1875 the Congregation of the Propaganda, then in charge of 
American affairs, issued an “Instruction to the Bishops of the United 
States concerning the Public Schools,” in which the Catholics, both 
for their own sake and the vital interests of the American Republic, 
were directed to establish their own schools. The Instruction read: 
All are agreed that there is nothing so needful to this end as the establishment of 
Catholic schools in every -:place—and schools in no way inferior to the public ones. 
Every effort, then, must be directed toward starting Catholic schools where they are 
not, and, where they are, toward enlarging them and providing them with better 
accommodations and equipment until they have nothing to suffer, as regards teach- 
ers or furniture, by comparison with the public schools.? 
The next important ecclesiastical law for this country was promul- 
gated by the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, 1884, which has 
been the directing force during the period of the greatest develop- 
ment of the parochial schools. Therein Catholic parents were not 
only exhorted to send their children to Catholic schools, but com- 
manded to do so. 
Therefore we not only exhort Catholic parents with paternal love, but we also com- 
mand them with all of the authority in our power, to procure for their beloved off- 
spring, given to them by God, reborn in Christ in baptism, and destined for heaven, a 
truly Christian and Catholic education, and to defend and safeguard them from the 
dangers of an education merely secular during the entire period of childhood and 
youth; and therefore to send them to parochial schools or others truly Catholic, unless 
perchance the Ordinary, in a particular case,,should judge that it might be permitted 
otherwise. 
Due consideration was made for those parents who for a sufficient 
cause did not send their children to the parish schools. A decree of 
far-reaching importance was the following: 
Near each church, where it does not yet exist, a parochial school is to be erected 
within two years from the promulgation of this council, and is to be maintained in 
perpetuum, unless the bishop, on account of grave difficulties, judge that a postpone- 
ment beallowed * * *. 
All Catholic parents are bound to send their children to the parochial schools, 
unless either at home or in other Catholic schools they may sufficiently provide for 
the Christian education of their children, or unless it be lawful to send them to other 
schools on account of a sufficient cause, approved by the bishop, and with opportune 
cautions and remedies. As to what is a Catholic school, it is left to the judgment of 
the Ordinary to define.* 
This council, furthermore, by its decrees touching upon the super- 
vision of the schools by the pastor, the training of teachers in the 
normal schools of their novitiates, the certification of teachers, 
both religious and secular, laid the foundation for that development

in organization and administration which in the past 25 years has 
been remarkable. 
PRESENT ORGANIZATION. 
The parochial schools, like the parish churches, are organized in 
diocesan systems. They come immediately under the jurisdiction 
of the bishop of the diocese. In ecclesiastical law the elementary 
school always enjoys this peculiar relation to episcopal authority, 
even when it is conducted by a community of teachers who might 
not in other things be subject to the bishop. 
The administration of schools in the dioceses of this country is 
usually confided to a school board consisting of priests of the diocese 
appointed by the bishop, and of which the bishop and his vicar 
general are often ex-officio members.'! Considering the conditions 
prevailing in certain dioceses where it has been impossible to estab- 
lish many schools these boards are very numerous. In the 99 dioceses 
of the United States (including Alaska), 58 had school boards in 
1912-13. There is no uniformity in the constitution nor in the 
functions of this board. In some of the dioceses the boards are 
subdivided into sectional boards for the limited jurisdiction of 
counties, deaneries, etc. All actually constitute one board for the 
diocese. In recent years some of the school boards have been abol- 
ished, and others limited in their powers because of the appointments 
of diocesan superintendents of schools. The ordinary functions of 
the board in dioceses not having a superintendent of schools are: 
Issuing school regulations, inspection, and conducting examinations. 
The special functions are: The formation and maintenance of the 
course of studies, the adoption and change of textbooks, and the 
certification of teachers. There are in the United States 41 dioceses 
having the school board alone and no other officers of supervision. 
In dioceses having a superintendent of schools and a board for ex- 
amination of teachers, the functions of the school board are naturally 
more restricted. Representing episcopal authority in educational 
affairs, the board receives the annual report of the superintendent, 
acts on his recommendations and the larger questions of admin- 
istration. Their actions are mostly of a legislative nature. In many 
dioceses, however, the board forms, as it were, the council of the 
bishop on educational matters, and school regulations are issued 
directly by the bishop or the superintendent of schools. 
The chief officers of supervision are the diocesan superintendents 
or supervisors of schools, the school visitors or examiners, and the 
community inspectors. The superintendents are and have been the 
most potent forces in organizing diocesan systems. The first to hold   
     1 The school board of the archdiocese of N' Drleans, called the Catholic Board of Education, offers an 
exception to the above statement. It consists of 11 priests and 5laymen. The archbishop is president and 
his vicar general vice president. 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
  
ROMAN CATHOLIC PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 847 
the office was appointed in the archdiocese of New York in 1888. 
Similar appointments followed in Omaha and Philadelphia in 1891 
and 1894, respectively, and at present (1913) 23 dioceses employ 
priests in that capacity. Table 1 presents a list of supervisory offi- 
cers of this rank for 1912-13. Two changes are noted for the year, 
’ viz, the appointment of a superintendent in the diocese of Cleveland, 
where the office was created and the Rev. William A. Kane placed 
in charge, and the appointment of the Rev. Joseph A. Dunney to 
succeed the Rev. William R. Charles as inspector of schools of the 
diocese of Albany. 
The diocesan superintendents of the United States are organized 
under the auspices of the Catholic Educational Association and con- 
stitute the main element in the superintendents’ section of the parish 
school department. They meet annually at the time of the conven- 
tion of the Catholic Educational Association to discuss problems 
peculiar to their work. Only duly appointed diocesan superintend- 
ents, community inspectors, and representatives of bishops and 
school boards are allowed to participate in the proceedings of the 
section. At the last convention of the association held in New 
Orleans, June 30-July 3, the topics discussed were: ‘‘The Superin- 
tendents’ Visit to the School,” by the Rev. John A. Dillon, superin- 
tendent of parish schools, diocese of Newark, N. J.; “Industrial and 
Vocational Training,’’ by the Rey. Michael J. Larkin, superintendent 
of parish schools, archdiocese of New York. In meetings held jointly 
with pastors of schools two topics discussed were: “The Need of 
Men Teachers in Educational Work,” by the Rev. Bede Horsa, 
O. S. B., of St. Joseph’s Seminary and College, St. Benedict, La.; 
and ‘The Priest’s Adaptability for School Work,” by the Rev. 
John Ryan, pastor of St. Paul’s Church, Cambridge, Mass.* 
Special meetings of the diocesan superintendents may be called at 
other times during the school year. In March, 1913, the superin- 
tendents of eastern dioceses met in New York City, and one of the 
important topics discussed was the curriculum. 
The ordinary functions of the superintendent are the collection of 
statistics, inspection of schools, conducting of examinations, control 
of course of study and textbooks, and whatever else of a special nature 
may be necessary or suggested by diocesan authorities for the stand- 
ardization of the schools. He renders an annual report to the bishop 
or school board, and this in many instances is printed for general 
distribution. In 1913 the diocesan superintendents of New York, 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, and St. Louis issued such reports. 
They circulate principally in the respective dioceses, and in a few 
instances appear in the form of yearbooks, which contain, in addition 
1 Rep, of Pie and ene of Tenth Annual Meeting of Cath. Ed. Reon (colin Ohio).  
-P-A-G-E-402
    
348 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
to a tabulated report, much information and direction of value to 
principals and teachers. 
A supervisory officer whose name does not appear in the Official 
Catholic Directory, nor in ordinary sources of information on schools, 
but whose work is of far-reaching importance is the Community 
Inspector, so called because he is a member of a religious community, 
or congregation, who inspects the schools of his community. At 
times when the community conducts schools in many dioceses the 
inspector’s jurisdiction is extended to an ecclesiastical province, like, 
for example, the province of New York, which embraces the arch- 
diocese of New York and the dioceses of Albany, Brooklyn, Buffalo, 
Newark, Ogdensburg, Rochester, Syracuse, and Trenton, or the 
States of New York and New Jersey, but usually the inspector’s 
duties are confined to the schools of his community or congregation 
in a single diocese. These he visits and examines regularly, under 
the direction of the diocesan superintendent. _He uses the sugges- 
tions of the superintendent, acts upon the results of the latter’s tests 
or inspection and endeavors to keep the schools of his charge up to 
the required standard. 
The community inspector, as in the case of teaching Sisters, is 
able with a limited number of schools under her care to give more 
time and attention to them than would be possible for the general 
or diocesan superintendent of a large system. She is expected to 
spend the school year visiting her schools, and as she resides with the 
teachers during her visits, has a rare opportunity of addressing them 
collectively and directing them individually. 
The inspectors of a diocese are organized under a board of inspectors 
and their activities are unified and controlled by the diocesan superin- 
tendent who is ex officio chairman or president. He calls regular 
meetings of the board and is throughout the year in constant com- 
munication with individual inspectors on the affairs of thecommunity’s 
schools. He quite properly regards the inspectors as his most 
efficient auxiliaries. During recent years, since the movement for 
the appointment of diocesan superintendents has taken hold, the 
number of community inspectors has also increased. Lists of these 
officials are published in reports of superintendents of schools, e. g., 
Report of Superintendent of Archdiocese of Philadelphia, of the 
Diocese of Newark, etc. In 1912-13, the diocese of Hartford, Conn., 
followed the example of other dioéeses like St. Louis, Cincinnati, 
Newark, and Pittsburgh, by appointing three community inspectors 
for the Sisters of Mercy, the largest teaching community in the 
diocese. Each inspector has a section of the diocese under her charge. 
The supervisory official who is placed in immediate charge of the 
individual parochial school is the pastor of the parish. He may and 
often does delegate his office to an assistant priest, or to a member
-P-A-G-E-403
  ROMAN CATHOLIC PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 849 
of the teaching community in charge of the school. The pastor is 
held responsible by the bishop for the standing of the school, and 
he is obliged by ecclesiastical law to visit it regularly, supervise the 
teaching, especially of religion and sacred history, and personally 
or by delegate to perform the functions which we associate with the 
work of school principal. 
EXTENT OF SCHOOLS. 
Parochial schools are found in all of the dioceses of the United 
States, varying in number according to the extent and condition of 
the Catholic population. In the larger dioceses they have been 
increasing every year. From 3,812 in 1900 the system expanded to 
4,972 in 1910, an increase of 30 per cent. Since 1910 284 new 
schools have been added to the list. The latest enumeration, sup- 
plied by the Official Catholic Directory, the only source at present 
for general statistics of the Catholic Church in this country, gives 
5,256 schools, an increase of 137 over the number recorded for 1912. 
There has been also a proportionate increase in the number of 
pupils enrolled. From 1900 to 1910, while the Catholic population 
increased 35 per cent, there was an increase of 40 per cent in the 
number of pupils in parochial schools. In 1912 the enrollment was 
1,333,786 which increased to 1,360,761 in 1913. 
The average attendance is not recorded for the schools of the 
entire country, but according to the reports of diocesan superintendents 
for various cities and dioceses it is found to be high. For example, 
in the last report of the superintendent of the archdiocese of Cin- 
cinnati, being that of 1908-9, the average daily attendance of pupils 
in 36 schools of the city of Cincinnati was 96 per cent; that of 57 
schools outside the city, 97 per cent—a general average of 96.5 for 
96 schools. From a similar source we learn that the average atten- 
dance for 1912 was 91 per cent in the city of St. Louis and 92.4 per 
cent in the archdiocese of New York. In 1912-13 the ratio of daily 
attendance to total enrollment was 84 per cent for the archdiocese 
of Philadelphia and 87 per cent for the diocese of Newark. These 
dioceses are merely selected as examples of what may be asserted of 
most of the diocesan systems. They are the only ones whose figures 
are available. 
The total annual expenditure for the maintenance of parochial 
schools can at best be only estimated. No official statistics on this 
point are gathered for the entiresystem. The superintendents of the 
archdiocese of New York record the cost of maintenance for each 
year, as for example in 1912-13, it was $745,000, or an average of $9 
per pupil enrolled. No other superintendents make it an item in 
their reports. Catholics know that the cost is much lower than in
-P-A-G-E-404
  350 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
public schools; how much lower is a question. The superintendent 
of St. Louis says on this point, in his report for 1912: i 
We are generally of the opinion that the cost of educating a child in the parochial 
schools amounts to only one-half the sum expended for the education of the public- 
school child. This is, however, a gratuitous assertion. We have no statistics to sub- 
stantiate it. The superintendent ought, therefore, to be in possession of the requisite 
data that would enable him to compute the per capita cost of educating the children 
of our schools. This would include simply the cost of maintenance; the cost of ground 
and school buildings could be estimated separately. 
The most reasonable estimate so far made of the per capita cost 
of education in the parochial schools is that of Dr. Burns, in his 
“Growth and Development of the Catholic School System of the 
United States.” On this point he says (pp. 292-293): 
What is now the average cost of Catholic parish-school maintenance per pupil 
throughout the country? The amount can not be stated with any degree of accuracy. 
At best no more than a probable estimate can be made at present. The cost appears 
to vary within almost as wide limits as the cost of public-school education. There 
are numerous schools in which the total annual per capita cost of maintenance is not 
more than $5, while in the archdiocese of New York, as has been seen, it is slightly 
over $11. In particular schools in the large cities the cost runs up to even a much 
higher figure than this; and in some schools, too, the cost is considerably under $5. 
But only conditions that are more or less general need be considered, and the above 
figures may be taken as representing the ordinary extremes. It may therefore be 
said that the average cost of maintenance per pupil, based upon enrollment, ranges 
from $5 to $11. The mean of the range is $8, and this may accordingly be taken as 
the most probable common average of the annual cost of education per capita in the 
parish schools the country over. 
Adopting Dr. Burns’s method of calculation, the total expenditure 
for the maintenance of parochial schools in 1912-13 was about 
$10,886,088. This is felt to be a conservative estimate, for the sta- 
tistics of school enrollment recorded for certain dioceses are too low 
and bear evidence of having been raised not annually, but at most 
every two or three years. The estimate, however, gives some idea 
of the fund voluntarily raised each year by Catholics for the kind of 
elementary education they desire for their children. It is borne in 
addition to their pro rata tax as citizens for the support of the public 
schools, but it by no means represents what the State is saved annu- 
ally by this system of parochial schools. 
According to the last Report of the United States Commissioner 
of Education (1912) the average per capita cost of maintenance in 
State common schools for 1910-11 was $34.71. This represented 
the outlay for elementary and high schools, and as our parochial 
high schools are comparatively few in number it is more equitable 
to form an estimate according to the cost of elementary education 
alone. In the Commissioner’s Report for 1911 an estimate is found 
for the elementary, viz, $22.67. Now, Catholic parochial schools

are established in greatest numbers in the North Atlantic, Central, 
and Western Divisions of our country, and the averages there for 
State common schools are invariably higher than in the South 
Atlantic and South Central Divisions. The actual cost to the State 
of educating the children of parochial schools were they to present 
themselves as pupils in the public schools would consequently be 
much higher than this general average of $22.67. Accepting that, 
however, as a very conservative basis, and estimating according to 
the average attendance for common schools in 1911-12, 71.4 per 
cent, the annual cost of instructing the 1,360,088 children in paro- 
chial schools would be $21,902,400, and the total annual saving to 
the State would include interest at 4 per cent on such an outlay, or 
$22,778,496. 
The accommodaiion of these children in school buildings and 
equipment would, of course, be a much larger consideration. In 
1910 the estimated value of property in State common-school systems 
was $1,100,007,512, or about $62 per pupil.t At this rate the outlay 
to accommodate the pupils of parochial schools, apart from the cost 
of maintenance, would be at least $84,325,450. 
THE CURRICULUM AND GRADING. 
The question of the curriculum for elementary schools was most 
frequently discussed during the year 1912-13. In the various dio- 
ceses there is at present no strict uniformity in the curriculum nor 
in the grading of the parochial elementary schools. Generally 
speaking, the eight-grade system prevails and the curriculum is 
ordinarily determined so as to meet the requirements for entrance 
into the public high schools, or so as to give a child what is considered 
a complete elementary education before he attains the working age. 
In consequence the parochial schools are very similar in grading and 
curriculum to the public schools. With the increase of parish high 
schools, which have been established less extensively than elementary 
schools, more autonomy has resulted, and with it a sense of freedom 
and confidence for the attainment of better coordination of elemen- 
tary and secondary work without determination of method or plan by 
outside influences. There is, however, no general nor fixed convic- 
tion that the present system is entirely satisfactory. It has been 
found inefficient in many respects, and during the past few years the 
reorganization of curriculum and grading has ranked as one of the 
leading and most widely discussed questions. In the meeting of the 
Catholic Educational Association held in Pittsburgh, 1912, it was one 
of the most seriously, although informally, discussed topics, and 
again in the recent convention held in New Orleans, 1913. It has

-P-A-G-E-406
  
    352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
been taken up by superintendents in their recent reports, and evi- 
dently has been a question of deliberation at the meetings of teachers 
and school boards. 
In the discussion there are clearly two contending parties—one 
urging the reduction of the eight grades to six and a readjustment of 
the curriculum so that the elementary course will be completed in 
six years, and the other maintaining that the present system must, for 
the present at least, be retained. The first class, curiously enough, 
does not comprise those engaged in the management of the elemen- 
tary schools but, for the most part, those whose field is college and 
high-school work, and their contribution to the discussion is not held 
to be an impartial nor disinterested view. They maintain usually 
that the present arrangement of studies and grades in the elementary 
school is not based on any sound pedagogical principles, but is rather 
the outgrowth of circumstances; that the course is too elaborate and | 
lengthy; that it is without definite purpose and aim and hence is 
wasteful of time and energy; that by not admitting differentiation 
until after eight years, it unduly retards the prospective college 
student by preventing his early beginning of classical studies, and 
ultimately his entrance into professional life at a reasonable age. 
At the last meeting of the Catholic Educational Association, held 
in New Orleans, June 29 to July 8, the curriculum was the leading 
topic of papers and discussions in all departments and sections. 
The paper read by Rey. Dr. Francis W. Howard, secretary general 
of the association, formed the basis of much of the discussion. As 
it gave occasion for the expression of opinion on the side of the sec- 
ondary and college education departments, we quote the following: 
The curriculum, therefore, is a subject which educators will ever discuss, and on 
which the last word will never be said. American educators freely acknowledge the 
evils that exist to-day and are insistent in the demand for reform. Out of this ferment 
will come some rational plan of education, or at least more order than now prevails; 
and if this surmise be correct, then the present time is fraught with great importance 
and significance for Catholic educators, * * * 
In dealing with the problem of the curriculum from the standpoint of Catholic edu- 
cators, we are confronted with several different lines of action. 
(1) Shall we conform to the secular system in subjects, textbooks, management of 
courses, grading and adjustment of the various departments of the system, with the 
addition of religious instruction, and Catholic philosophy? 
(2) Shall we endeavor to arrange our work in entire independence of the State 
system? 
(3) Shall we endeavor to make a systematic study of present conditions, inquire 
into the causes of present confusion, and endeavor to formulate the principles of some 
sound system of Christian education that will be in substantial accord with the reason- 
able features of the secular education of the day, and at the same time insure us a 
moderate and reasonable measire of independence? 
Time does not permit a discussion of these various lines of action, and we pass them 
over with the statement that by adopting the first we face gradual extinction; the 
second is impossible for us, and the most prudent thing for us to do is to adopt the
-P-A-G-E-407
  
ROMAN CATHOLIC PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 855 
third plan outlined. The time has come in this country when we should decide 
whether we can have a plan of our own or whether we shall be content to imitate the 
experiments and follow the changes of secular education.! 
Brother John Waldron, S. M., of Clayton, Mo., upheld Dr. Howard’s 
view that elementary work should be completed in six grades, main- 
taining that— 
pedagogical, psychological, and physiological motives urge us to introduce a change 
in the aim, nature, and methods of instruction when the boy enters the adolescent 
stage of his life. Administrational demands alone may urge a delay, but even from 
the administrator’s point of view the wisdom of differentiation at this age is becoming 
more generally recognized. 
I believe the majority of college men will agree with me that it is better for the boy 
to pass directly into the preparatory class of the secondary department after a thorough 
six-year course of elementary training in correct habits of study and discipline than 
have him linger along during two additional years to do what will bring him no gain 
for college purposes. 
It was stated in the discussion that the arguments advanced for 
the change in curriculum did not imply that the present program of 
eight grades should be done in six years, ‘‘nor that the present paro- 
chial system of eight grades should be cut down to six.” It was 
contended rather that— 
the first six years of school should be devoted to elementary work, with insistence on 
thoroughness and intensity, and then instruction should become secondary in charac- 
ter; whether the boy passes over to high school or college control, or, as will happen 
with the vast majority, he remains for at least two years longer in the parochial system. 
In the college department of the association the discussion reached 
the point where the following resolution was passed, not as a general 
resolution of the association, but as a departmental one. 
As there seems to be a general agreement among educators that pupils entering the 
secondary schools from the eighth grade are too far advanced in age and that secondary 
education should begin at or about the age of 12, we favor an arrangement whereby 
pupils may be able to begin their high-school course after the completion of 6 years 
of elementary work.? 
The party in opposition to the proposed change numbers a large 
and influential body of teachers, pastors, and many superintendents 
of diecesan-school systems—those who are immediately in control of 
elementary education and actively concerned with its peculiar prob- 
lems. They are not convinced that the prevailing arrangement is 
perfect or entirely satisfactory, but neither are they favorably 
impressed by the remedies suggested for improvement. Whereas 
those interested in college and secondary education have deplored the 
length of the elementary course in years, this party has found one of 
its chief difficulties in the fact that great numbers of children depart

from their influence and care too early, i. e., to enter the public high 
school or to work, and this at a time in their lives when for many 
reasons the influence of the Catholic school is considered necessary. 
The shortening of the course in years would not help the situation, 
but rather, so it is thought, aggravate it. Whatever may favorably 
be said of the early beginning of secondary work in the parochial 
school, the fact is alleged that the pupil would then be ready for the 
preparatory college or for secondary work under other auspices, as 
well as under the auspices of the parochial school. Furthermore, it 
is shown that the elementary school is to-day maintained with hard- 
ship and many sacrifices by great numbers of parishes. For them 
the organization of the high-school department in equipment and 
teachers would be an impossibility if the school were to give courses 
equal or superior to those offered by the public high schools to which 
the children have ready access. 
On this matter, Rev. John A. Dillon, superintendent of schools, 
diocese of Newark, N. J., writes in his report for 1912-13: 
The committee of the Catholic Educational Association (committee on the reform 
of the curriculum) seemed to feel that a change at this time would be inexpedient, 
because, unfortunately, we are almost entirely dependent on the State school system; 
and if we alone abridged the curriculum in our elementary schools our graduates might 
be refused the privileges which are granted to the graduates of the public elementary 
schools, thus not only handicapping our children but also probably bringing about a 
depreciation of the splendid work done in our schools. It is to be regretted that this 
dependence is mainly due to the fact that we have so few free Catholic high schools 
as a part of our diocesan-school system. Their absence makes us dependent, much as 
we dislike it, even where the opinion seems to be general that time could be saved or 
at least put to better use.! 
PAROCHIAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The Catholic high-school movement grows stronger each successive 
year; and in that phase which concerns us here, the parochial high 
school, there is noticeable at present an interesting development. 
When the committee on high schools of the Catholic Educational 
Association reported in 1911, it was estimated that there were between 
four and five hundred parochial schools doing high-school work.? 
No general statistics of a trustworthy nature have been compiled 
since that time, but there are many evidences of the spread of the 
movement. The committee reported on 295 and found that each of 
252 was directly connected with a single parish school, while only 15 
of them were directly connected with several parish schools. The 
report stated: 
Nearly all of the schools are the offshoots of single parish schools. Even in towns 
and cities which boast of a number of large and well-equipped parish schools, with

ROMAN CATHOLIC PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 855 
thousands of pupils, no attempt is made, as a rule, to build up a central high school 
with which all the existing parish schools would be made to fit in.' 
In the most conspicuous examples of high-school foundations 
which have taken place since that report was rendered, the central 
high school, rather than the single parish high school, was adopted 
and apparently with good results. In 1911 three high-school 
centers were opened in the city of St. Louis and in the report of the 
superintendent for that year it is stated: 
On the whole we have reason to feel highly pleased with our success in the past year. 
* * Our financial support was more than could be expected from the outset. 
* * * We had expected to remain at least two years in our present quarters. Ow- 
ing, however, to our extraordinary membership, we shall be constrained to seek more 
commodious schools for the continuance of our work so auspiciously inaugurated.? 
In the city of Philadelphia the new Catholic Girls’ High School, 
which was opened September, 1912, to be the crowning element in 
the parish school system for the education of girls, and to emulate in 
efficiency the Catholic Boys’ High School, successfully operated since 
1890, has after one year fully realized the hopes of its founders. 
Monsignor P. R. McDevitt, superintendent of schools for Philadelphia, 
says of it in his latest report (1913): : 
The most notable event in our scholastic year was the opening of the Catholic Girls’ 
High School on the 18th of September, 1912. This new high school is the logical 
development of the high school centers for girls, which were organized in September, 
1909, to provide a two-year course for the graduates of the parish schools. The high 
school will continue in broader lines the work of the high school centers, and will for 
the present provide two courses, viz: General course, four years—courses determined 
upon in order to meet what are considered the special needs of the great body of our 
Catholic girls. * * * The graduates of the eighth grade of the parish schools who 
entered the high school in September, 1912, numbered 326, all of whom followed the 
uniform schedule prescribed for the first year.* 
This Catholic high school is not owned by a single parish, nor by 
several parishes. It is a diocesan institution, under the immediate 
direction of the archbishop. It marks a new departure in Catholic 
education, for the high school is usually owned by the parish or 
teaching community in charge of it. A detail of administration of 
special interest concerns the teaching staff, which is formed from the 
members of four different religious communities of nuns. Hach 
separate community is given charge of a department, and the roster 
of studies is so arranged that one community does not encroach upon 
another community’s province. At present the faculty consists of 
16 nuns, 1 lay teacher, and the superintendent of parish schools, who 
is acting as principal. The latter writes of the arrangement: 
Although one year, perhaps, is too short a time to form a final judgment of the value 
of this experiment in the administration of the Catholic high school, its present success *

warrants the hope and the belief that a plan which has so many points in its favor will 
ultimately prove its feasibility and efficiency. 
STANDARDIZATION OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The report of the committee on high schools of the Catholic Educa- 
tional Association, referred to above, showed that only 19 of the 
parochial high schools were affiliated with Catholic colleges, while 56 
were affiliated or in some way connected with non-Catholic colleges, 
normal schools, and State universities. The committee pleaded for 
a more general recognition of them on the part of Catholic colleges in 
order to promote a closer organization of the educational system. 
Here, surely, is a situation that is full of significance [the committee reported]. For 
it means that our secondary schools, which ought to form 2 natural and easy passageway 
from the parish schools to the Catholic colleges, are, in steadily increasing numbers, 
being drawn into such academic relationships as will make ita most easy, if not an in- 
evitable thing, for the Catholic boy, on finishing his course in our schools, to pass up 
to a non-Catholic college.? 
A significant movement looking to a better articulation of all the 
elements in the Catholic educational system, and especially tending 
toward the standardization of secondary schools, was inaugurated 
by the Catholic University of America on April 17, 1912, when the 
trustees agreed to affiliate with the university all secondary schools 
which could comply with its conditions. The trustees thus announced 
their action: 
Pope Leo XIII, the founder of the Catholic University, says in his apostolic letter, 
“Magna Nobis Gaudia,”’ of March 7, 1887: ‘‘We exhort you all that you shall take care 
to affiliate with your university your seminaries, colleges, and other Catholic institu- 
tions according to the plan suggested in the constitutions, in such a manner as not to 
destroy their autonomy.” The Pope in these words seems to have realized what has 
since become an urgent need in our educational system and to have anticipated a 
movement that is now quite general among our teaching communities. The establish- 
ment of the schools of philosophy, letters, and science, offering courses of special 
interest and utility to lay students, naturally suggested some sort of articulation between 
the university and the colleges. On the other hand, the Sisters who attended the first 
session of the university summer school in 1911 have frequently expressed their desire 
for affiliation with the university, in preference to any arrangement that might be 
offered by other universities, and some of our institutions have already applied for 
affiliation. 
Any Catholic high school may be affiliated on the following conditions: 
(1) The high school must give a course extending over four years and including a 
total of 15 units, of which at least 3 must be devoted to English and 3 to some other 
subject. (Meaning of a unit: A subject, e. g., English, pursued four or five hours 
a week for a school year of from 36 to 40 weeks.) 
(2) The subjects required, with their respective values, are: Religion, 2 units; 
English, 3 units; some other language, 2 units; mathematics, 2 units; social science 
(including history), 1 unit; natural science, 1 unit. Four units to be elective. They 
must be selected in such a way, however, as to give another course of 3 units, i. e., 
one or more units must be advanced work in one of the subjects, other than English,

enumerated above. Where Latin is to be pursued in college, at least 2 units of Latin 
must be taken in the high school. 
In case of affiliation the university agrees to furnish the institution 
with an assignment of the matter for each subject offered in the 
curriculum, and to send at the end of the year a set of examination 
questions sealed, which are to be opened in the class when assembled 
for examination. The papers are then to be sealed in the presence of 
the class and forwarded to the university, where they will be exam- 
ined and marked according to a certain scale. All students who 
successfully pass the examinations held during the four years in the 
high school shall be admitted without further examination in these 
subjects to any college affiliated by the university. 
The invitation of the university was eagerly accepted by many 
Catholic secondary schools. Some were ready to comply with its 
requirements immediately, and others signified their intention of 
rearranging their curriculum and seeking affiliation as soon as possi- 
ble. During the year 1912-13, 47 high schools and academies were 
duly affiliated, accepting the common standard offered by the uni- 
veisity, and the prospects are that many more will be placed on the 
list of affiliated schools during the year 1913-14. This movement 
undertaken by the university is the first organized effort made by 
any Catholic institution for the standardization of the secondary 
schools of the system, and its influence on the future parochial high 
schools is bound to be great. Something of its extent and repre- 
sentative nature will appear from the following list of high schools 
already affiliated, grouped under their respective States:

IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS. 
Agencies for the improvement of teachers both during the period 
of preparation and while in service are increasing in number and 
efficiency. In recent years the novitiates of religious communities, 
which are the normal schools of teaching brotherhoods and sister- 
hoods, have been better able to follow the injunctions of the Third 
Plenary Council of Baltimore regarding the pedagogical training of 
the future teachers, and instances are becoming yearly less common 
of the young novices being sent out to the schools before the com- 
pletion of their religious and pedagogical training. 
The mother houses are also active in conducting summer schools 
for teachers in the field. The services of university and college 
professors, and of special instructors in addition to some of their own 
experienced teachers, are annually enlisted for courses of five and 
six weeks’ duration. Some communities have for years followed 
the custom of recalling to the mother house each summer all of their 
teachers to participate in the summer school; others recall teachers 
of certain departments or grades alternately, so that all teachers 
have the advantage of this summer course every second or third 
year. In the summer schools the courses usually followed embrace 
educational psychology, methods of teaching and management, and, 
where the communities are engaged in secondary work, some of the 
academic as well as the professional subjects. In certain recent 
summer schools a number of courses have been given in the methods 
of teaching religion. 
Teachers’ institutes are also held for the especial benefit of teachers 
in the service. These usually last four or five days and, while single 
and combined communities have often conducted them, the usual 
plan at present is to hold them under diocesan auspices. During 
the year 1913 such institutes were reported in the dioceses of Boston, 
Mass.; Hartford, Conn. (where a summer school was also held); 
Portland, Oreg.; and Los Angeles, Cal.
-P-A-G-E-413
ROMAN CATHOLIC PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 859 
Summer schools under university and collegiate auspices, offering 
educational courses, were successfully conducted in 1913 at Mar- 
quette University, Milwaukee, Wis.; De Paul University, Chicago, 
Tll.; Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pa.; Creighton University, 
Omaha, Nebr.; and at the Catholic University of America, Wash- 
ington, D.C. The last-named, being the summer session of teachers’ 
college, had the largest and most representative attendance; 383 
students were enrolled, all of whom except 22 were teaching nuns 
who belonged to 75 distinct branches of religious communities. 
They came from 29 States of this country and from Canada, and 
represented 48 American dioceses. 
The teachers’ college of the Catholic University, which was 
founded in 1911 for the higher education of Catholic women teachers, 
is regarded as the most potent agency of its kind ever established by 
the Catholic Church in this country. In its regular and summer 
sessions it has thus far (1913) enrolled 1,111 students. Besides the 
preparation of teachers for the colleges and secondary schools, a 
special phase of its work is the training of teachers for the community 
normal schools, or novitiates, who will later be intrusted with the 
professional formation of the general body of teachers for the paro- 
chial schools. 
Table 2 gives the general statistics for parochial schools in all of 
the dioceses of the United States for the school years 1911-1912 and 
1912-1913. The Catholic population for each diocese is also given. 
The figures are taken from the Official Catholic Directory and from 
the reports of diocesan superintendents of schools. Since 1911 the 
Official Catholic Directory, issued usually in February or March, has 
gathered the school statistics in October; the figures consequently 
in the 1913 directory represent the enrollment for the school year 
1912-1913.

HISTORY AND COMPOSITION OF AMERIC 
  JEWRY. 
The first systematic attempt to deal with the problem of Jewish 
education in America in its various phases is of recent origin. 
In order to realize the magnitude of the problem and the peculiar 
difficulties which constantly present themselves in coping with it, it 
is necessary to take a larger view of our topic and to inquire into the 
general historic and cultural conditions which have brought about 
the present educational situation in American Jewry and the remark- 
able complications connected with it. 
Our inquiry must naturally begin with the history and composition 
of American Jewry as it is constituted at present. The Jewry of 
America is the product of three successive waves of immigration, 
which may be designated as the Spanish, the German, and the 
Russian. 
THE SPANISH JEWS. 
The first Jews who came to this country were descendants of those 
who had been exiled from the Iberian Peninsula in 1492, the year 
in which America was discovered. They came to this country prin- 
cipally by way of central and southern America. For reasons which 
  
1The significance of the title is apparent. The paper relates to Jewish education, not 
the education of the Jews. The schools fostered by the Bureau of Education of the Jew- 
ish community are designed to impart a knowledge of Judaism and its religious institu- 
tions. The children who attend them are also pupils of the public schools. The work 
described is unique in American educational history. The author writes from abundant 
knowledge of the conditions, for he is chairman of the board of trustees of the bureau,

need not detain us here, their numbers-have gradually decreased; 
and, while there still exist, as a monument to their past glory, a few 
of their congregations with attached schools, and though a number of 
them still take an active and honorable part in American Jewish af- 
fairs, they have yielded the predominant influence to the more recent 
settlers and represent no distinct phase of the Jewish problem. 
Very recently a new immigration of so-called Spanish Jews, pro- 
ceeding from the Turkish Empire and the Balkans, has been wending 
its course to this country and is slowly forcing itself upon the atten- 
tion of Jewish workers and educators, but it is not yet of sufficient 
importance to affect the general aspect of Jewish life or Jewish 
education. 
THE GERMAN JEWS. 
The second wave of Jewish immigration came from Germany, prin- 
cipally from south Germany, and, apart from a number of individuals 
who came early in colonial times, it fell between the years 1830 and 
1870. It began as a result of the distress caused by the Napoleonic 
wars and reached its climax in consequence of the revolutionary 
upheavals in central Europe in 1848. 
To appreciate the educational standards and ideas which these 
settlers brought with them, and which they subsequently tried to 
adapt to their new environment, we must bear in mind that the 
majority of these immigrants came from rural communities, for 
the Jews of Germany of that period lived to a far greater extent 
on the land than they do at present. The great cultural reform in- 
augurated by Moses Mendelsohn (1729-1786), which in a surpris- 
ingly short time had pushed the German Jews from the isolated 
recesses of their ghettos to the forefront of European civilization, 
did not have the same revolutionizing and frequently disintegrating 
effect upon the smaller communities. Yet it succeeded in conquering 
their deep-seated prejudice against secular education. The Jews 
even in the smaller communities spoke the same language (though 
often with a slight dialectic modification), wore the same dress, and 
were, above all, molded by the same education as their fellow Ger- 
mans; and they lived, on the whole, on friendly terms with their non- 
Jewish neighbors. As far as Judaism is concerned, they were, with 
rare exceptions, strictly orthodox, loyal to the teachings of their 
ancestral religion and staunch in the observance of its practices. 
Their Jewish educational standards were simple, like their conditions 
of life. The reading of the Hebrew prayers, a fair acquaintance with 
the Five Books of Moses in the original, with a few selections from 
the other books of the Bible, a working knowledge of the Jewish 
ritual, and, as a token of particular excellence, a glimpse into post-
-P-A-G-E-421
  Bs THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 367 
biblical Hebrew literature, exhausted the educational ambitions of 
these simple-minded, but staunch-hearted, Jewish immigrants. 
The impetus which drove the German Jews to these shores was not 
a sudden outbreak, but a slow and steady process, and their immigra- 
tion proceeded in a similar manner. Settling at a time when the 
opportunities in this country were many, the German Jewish immi- 
grants, who combined German industry and love of discipline with 
Jewish sobriety and intelligence, made rapid strides and attained 
influence and prosperity. They found it comparatively easy to 
reproduce their religious and educational institutions in the new 
environment. Their religious life centered around their newly estab- 
lished congregations, which, as a result of their love of order and 
their marked organizing ability, soon became flourishing institutions. 
Their educational demands were supplied by the so-called congrega- 
tional school which was connected with the congregation and was 
generally under the supervision of its rabbi.t 
Sunday schools—Another educational factor was soon added in 
the form of the Sunday school, so called because the instruction 
there was limited to Sunday mornings. The Sunday school was 
originally independent of the congregation, although this changed 
considerably in the later course of development.? Such a school was 
founded as early as 1838 in Philadelphia, largely in cooperation 
with the Spanish Jewish element; and the progress of this type of 
educational institution may fairly be gauged from the fact that the 
school just mentioned has.gradually grown into an association which, 
at its recent seventy-fifth anniversary (March 2, 1913), maintained 
in that city 13 schools, with more than 4,000 ¢hildren. 
Simplification due to the reform movement.—The problem of 
Jewish education as affecting this section of American Jewry was 
still more simplified by the advent of the so-called Jewish reform 
movement, which was introduced from Germany after 1850. Under 
its influence most of the Jewish religious ceremonies were abolished 
and the rdle of Hebrew as a religious medium was considerably 
diminished. Jewish education, thus freed from its heaviest burden, 
was confined practically to a general acquaintance with the Hebrew 
prayers still retained in the reformed liturgy, an exposition of the 
Jewish principles of faith and a smattering of Jewish history. 
1 Some of the earliest Jewish schools established in this country supplied at the same 
time a secular education. A few schools founded subsequently by Russian Jews on a 
similar parochial p. are still in existence to-day. But as they are too few to affect 
the problem of Jewish education as a whole, they have been left out of account in the 
present sketch. 
2At present most Jewish Sunday schools are connected with congregations, mostly of 
the reform type. ‘“ Congregational schools’ are now usually those which are connected 
with congregations of a more conservative type and hold more than one session a week. 
     
-P-A-G-E-422
  368 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. . 
The generosity and spirit of organization which, aided by greater 
prosperity, are so admirably displayed in the philanthropic institu- 
tions of this section of the American Jewish community have also, 
though to a less extent, manifested themselves in their educational 
endeavors. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the 
Central Conference of American Rabbis, the two largest organiza- 
tions of Reform Judaism, have given, particularly in the last few 
years, a great deal of attention to the problem of Jewish education. 
The former organization has established a synagogue and school 
extension department, under the direction of Rabbi George Zepin. 
It is also interested, in conjunction with the latter organization, in 
the publication of Jewish textbooks. 
An attempt to organize the Jewish Sunday schools in the eastern 
States was recently made in New York. The Jewish Chautauqua 
Society, founded in 1893 by Dr. Henry Berkowitz, for the dissemi- 
nation of Jewish religious knowledge is developing a widespread 
activity, which includes schoolwork, though its emphasis is directed 
toward the Jewish youth of a more mature age. In 1905 a field- 
secretary department was created, and in 1912 a correspondence 
school for religious school teachers was established by the Chautauqua 
society under the direction of Dr. Rosenau in Baltimore. 
Institutions for higher education—In this connection mention 
should also be made of other educational institutions, which, though 
largely called forth by the later influx of the Russian immigrants and 
primarily designed for their benefit, yet owe their origin to the gen- 
erosity and organizing ability of the German Jews. Such institu- 
tions, serving partly other purposes than those of primary Jewish 
education, are the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati (founded in 
1875) and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New 
York (founded in 1886, reorganized in 1902) for the training of 
rabbis, the two teacher’s institutes subsequently founded under their 
respective auspices, the Gratz College of Philadelphia founded pre- 
viously (in 1875) also for the training of Jewish teachers, the Dropsie 
College for Hebrew and Cognate Learning (founded in 1907) for 
postgraduate studies and a few other agencies for the propagation 
of Jewish knowlege, which may be left out of consideration in this 
account. 
THE RUSSIAN MIGRATION, 
Fundamentally different both in its causes and consequences was 
the third wave of Jewish immigration. It is generally designated as 
the Russian, because the majority of the immigrants of this class 
came from the Russian Empire, including Poland. It must, however, 
be added that this wave includes, as well, the large Jewish centers 
bordering on Russia, such as Galicia, Roumania, and, to a lesser ex-
-P-A-G-E-423

tent, Hungary—in short, that part of Europe which, on account of 
its cultural status, was cleverly dubbed semi-Asia. 
In spite of the slow and grinding pressure of economic misery and 
political discrimination, to which the Russian Jews had long been 
subjected, the Jewish immigration from Russia, with a few excep- 
tions, started only after 1882, as an immediate result of the massacres, 
which have been often described, and of the anti-Jewish restrictions 
adopted by Czar Alexander III. When the immigration did come, it 
came, in contradistinction from the German-Jewish immigration, 
with the force of a volcanic eruption. It was also volcanic as regards 
its numbers, for, while the German-Jewish immigration affected but 
a part of German Jewry, which altogether amounts to half a million, 
the immigration from Russia and the adjoining countries drew on a 
population of no less than eight millions. The vastness and sudden- 
ness of this exodus determined to a large extent the fate of the new 
settlers, for they naturally drifted toward large centers, and in con- 
sequence, both the problem of Judaism and the problem of Jewish 
education assumed an essentially different and a far more complicated 
character. : 
Make-up of Russian Jews——But much more even than by these 
external factors was the problem of Jewish education among these 
newcomers determined by their religious and cultural make-up, which 
was vastly different from that of the German Jews. The complete 
cultural and social isolation in which the Jews of Poland and Russia 
had lived for centuries continued practically undisturbed till very 
recently. The influence of the Mendelsohnian movement in Germany, 
which penetrated even into Russia, affected but a thin layer of Russian 
Jewry, and the far more extensive and far more radical disturbances 
in present-day Russian Jewry have not as yet asserted themselves 
sufficiently to affect seriously the problem of Jewish education in this 
country. 
The strict isolation in which, owing to a variety of historic causes, 
the Jews of the Polish Kingdom had lived for centuries was even - 
moré accentuated when Poland came under the Russian régime, for 
by confining the Jews to the pale of settlement and excluding them 
from the villages the Russian Government drove them into congested 
towns and cities, in which they often formed the overwhelming ma- 
jority of the population. They lived in complete segregation from 
their neighbors, and the non-Jews were as much of a puzzle to the 
Jews as the latter were to the non-Jews. The terrible economic and 
_ political misery to which the Russian Jews were condemned made

enemies, which in reality they were; and in their despair they clung 
more fondly than ever to the soothing comfort and uplifting influ-

ence of Jewish life and doctrine. General secular education was at 
a low ebb in Russia; it was certainly far inferior both in extent and 
intensity to Jewish educational requirements. Yet even these meager 
educational advantages were withbeld from the Jews; and when in 
a whim of despotic generosity, as it occasionally happened, the Rus- 
sian Government decided to draw, or rather to drag, the Jews to 
secular education, it was suspected by them as an effort to land the 
Russian Jews in the fold of the Greek Orthodox Church. No won- 
der, therefore, that the Jews anxiously shunned all general education 
and lived their own life. They spoke their own language (Yiddish) ; 
they wore their own dress, and were in every manifestation of life 
Jews, and nothing but Jews. 
The intellectual character of their religion—The cap and corner 
stone of Russian Jewish life was religion—religion as taught by 
the Bible and interpreted and embodied in definite practices and 
institutions by post-biblical or rabbinical Judaism. To rabbinical 
Judaism, however, even more than to biblical Judaism, religion is 
inseparable from two fundamental aspects. It is, on the one hand, 
not merely a matter of faith, forming a set of abstract beliefs, but a 
complete system of living which embraces the most significant and 
the least significant functions in practical life. It is, on the other 
hand, a matter of knowledge and intellectual endeavor. Hence, prac- 
tical piety and religious knowledge or scholarship formed and still 
form the Boaz and Jachin of old-fashioned Russian Jewish life. 
In this connection we are particularly interested in the second factor, 
and it may be said without exaggeration that at no time during the 
long duration of Jewish history and in no place throughout the 
world-wide extent of the Jewish Diaspora has this great intellectual 
ideal of rabbinical Judaism, which nearly 2,000 years ago crystallized 
itself in a comprehensive system of primary and secondary education, 
been so intensely developed and so completely realized as in Russian 
Jewish life. 
To those who can not fall back upon their own personal experience 
it is difficult even remotely to convey the tremendous importance of 
this intellectual or educational factor among the Jews of Russia. 
Russian Jewry presented the unique spectacle of a community in 
which the social stratification was solely determined by knowledge 
or intellectual achievement, whose whole energy, unaffected by eco- 
nomic considerations and undiverted by the need of recreation or 
even solicitude for physical well-being, was so fiercely concentrated 
on the acquisition of knowledge for the sake of knowledge. The 
ideal type of Russian Jewish life was the Lamden, the scholar. The 
highest ambition of the Russian Jew was that his sons, and if he had 
only daughters, that his sons-in-law should be scholars, and the 
greatest achievement of a man’s life was his ability to provide sufli-

ciently for them, so that, relieved from economic cares, they might 
devote themselves unrestrictedly to Jewish learning. As a well- 
known scholar thoughtfully puts it, among the Jews of Poland and 
Russia there was no learned estate, not because there were no scholars, 
but because the people itself was a nation of students. To be sure, 
this learning was one-sided. Yet it was both wide and deep, for it 
embraced the almost boundless domains of religious Hebrew litera- 
ture and involved the knowledge of one of the most complicated sys- 
tems of law and profound theological doctrines. The knowledge of 
the Hebrew prayers and of the Five Books of Moses, which, as we 
have seen, was the objective of German Jewish education, would not 
have been sufficient to save the Russian Jew from the most terrible 
opprobrium—that of being an Am-Haaretz, an ignoramus. The 
ability to understand a Talmudic text, which demands years of prepa- 
ration, was the minimum requirement for one who wanted to be of 
any consequence in the community.? It is obvious, therefore, that 
these religious ideals and educational standards of Russian Jewish 
life were bound to call forth a distinct set of educational institutions 
designed to preserve and advance these ideals and standards. 
Educational agencies—We shall now proceed to describe in brief 
the educational agencies of Russian Jewry, for the difficulty of the 
problem of American Jewish education largely consists in the fact 
that it is determined and hampered by these models. Before describ- 
ing them, however, we wish to call attention to four general char- 
acteristics which attach to all of them and have left their impress 
upon the educational reproductions in this country, 
First, general education being completely neglected, the Jewish 
religious education in Russia took, as far as time and attention are 
concerned, the place of general education. Second, Russian Jewish 
life being completely barred from a normal physical and economical 
development, these institutions paid no attention whatsoever to hy- 
gienic requirements or the demands of economic life. Third, on 
account of the marked individualism of the Russian Jew and the 
lack of organizing ability produced by the life in the ghetto, these 
educational institutions were never formed into a system, but re-- 
mained almost entirely disconnected, individual undertakings. Fourth,

1The educational standards of Russian Jewish life may perhaps be best illustrated by 
an anecdote which was told to the writer by a friend. The latter, a native of southern 
Russia, in which Jewish education is less developed, was traveling through Lithuania, 
which is, on the contrary, known for its high educational level. A Jewish coachman by 
whom this gentleman was driven was muttering something in Hebrew. On being asked 
whether he was reciting the Psalms (which are generally recited. by the lower Jewish 
classes in Russia), the coachman indignantly retorted: “In your country they may be 
satisfied with knowing the Psalms; I am reciting the Mishnah!” The Mishnah is a code 
of law (civil, criminal, and ritual) upon which the Talmud is based. Imagine in any 
other country or nation a driver reciting by heart, let us say, the Justinian Code,

owing to a variety of historic causes, the Jewish woman was expected 
to limit herself to the religious life of the home and was almost 
entirely barred from the domain of Jewish religious knowledge. 
The first and most important of educational factors in Russian 
Jewish life was, as it is and should be everywhere—the home. From 
the very dawn of its consciousness, the child was made familiar with 
the Jewish religious practices and taught to pronounce, or, more cor- 
rectly, to prattle the short Hebrew prayers and benedictions which 
Judaism prescribes for drink and food and all occasions of life. 
Perhaps, more than by all descriptions this tendency may be illus- 
trated by the fact that Russian Jewish legend admiringly narrates of 
some of its saints, that, while still being nursed (children in Russia 
used to be nursed very late), they were able to pronounce the Hebrew 
blessing over the milk which they drew from their mothers’ breasts. 
When the boy was 5 years old (sometimes even earlier) he was 
sent to the heder (a Hebrew word designating “ room,” in all prob- 
ability originally the room in which the teacher lived). The heder, 
which is a very ancient Jewish institution, was, at least as far as 
Russia is concerned, not a communal institution, but a private school 
with a comparatively small number of children, ranging from 50 to 
as few as 4. 
The heder may be subdivided into two kinds: 
First, the elementary heder in which the following subjects were 
taught: Ivre, or Hebrew reading, for which the prayer book served 
as a textbook, and Humesh, or the Five Books of Moses ‘(later with 
commentaries). Characteristically enough, the child began with 
the Third Book of Moses, dealing with the complicated system of 
Jewish sacrifices and laws. 
Second, the advanced heder, in which the study of the Talmud 
(with only an occasional reading of the Bible) formed the main 
object of instruction. Jewish history, or even Biblical history, or 
the systematic teaching of religion and ethics was neglected, largely 
because the Talmudic literature, though in a disconnected manner, 
was thought to offer sufficient material for both. 
The hygienic condition of the heder which consisted, as indi- 
cated by the name, of a single room in which the teacher lived, often 
with a large family, was harassing. The hours of study were in- 
conceivably long, from 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening in the 
elementary heder, and from 7 in the morning to 9 or even 10 in the 
evening in the advanced heder. In the latter, in addition, a part or 
the whole of Thursday night was devoted to reviewing the ground 
covered during the week. There were neither examinations nor 
graduations nor prizes, such stimuli being unnecessary, because of 
the universal reverence for Jewish knowledge and its representatives.
-P-A-G-E-427
  THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 378 
The heder, in which the boy remained till about his fifteenth 
year,) was supplemented by two higher institutions of learning. 
First was the beth hamidrash (house of interpretation, or study), a 
curious institution which probably has no parallel in the life of any 
other nation. It was a building, such as was found even in the 
smallest Jewish community, which served not only as a house of 
prayer, but also as a sort of public library in which the Jewish 
residents spent daily a few hours of study and pious meditation 
and which was at the same-time a place of recreation, such as 
recreation was in Russian Jewish life. Above all, it was a place 
in which the Russian Jewish youths, without any guidance and left 
completely to themselves, continued in literal fulfillment of the 
Biblical injunction (Joshua i, 8) to meditate in the Law day and 
night, for they often spent there their scanty hours of rest. 
The other alternate institution of higher learning was the yeshibah 
or Talmudic academy. This type of institution, which was particu- 
larly prevalent in Lithuania, was generally founded by some famous 
rabbinical authority and was maintained, as were also its students 
who were counted by hundreds and even by thousands, by the gen- 
erous donations of the whole community. There the Jewish youths, 
under some sort of systematic guidance, which, however, made full 
allowance for Russian Jewish individualism, explored no less assidu- 
ously the vast domains of Jewish lore. 
Neither in the beth hamidrash nor in the yeshibah was there a 
definite system of promotion or graduation. Those who were par- 
ticularly successful in their advanced studies received from some 
celebrated authority the rabbinical diploma, the most coveted dis- 
tinction in Russian Jewish life, which, however, was by no means 
always put to practical use. Those who were less successful were 
satisfied to be educated laymen. From his status as a student, the 
Russian Jewish youth passed directly into the state of matrimony, at 
the age of 17 or 18, and without the slightest knowledge of life or’ 
business went to swell the mass of struggling humanity. 
One more institution which in Russian Jewish life was least im- 
portant, but when transferred to American soil became of unexpected 
significance, must be mentioned in this connection. The heder, as 
was pointed out above, was a private school, and the teacher who 
kept it depended on the tuition fee for his livelihood. For, poor as 
the Russian Jews were, they seldom considered themselves poor 
enough to forego the privilege of paying for the religious instruc- 
tion of their children. “Though you have to secure the means by 
begging, be sure to provide for the instruction of your children in   
1The age of attendance at the various Jewish schools differed somewhat in the dif- 
ferent parts of Russia. The difference in this as well as in other points was greatest 
between Lithuania and Poland.

  874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the Torah,” is a dying father’s admonition to his children. But for 
those children who were fatherless, or whose parents could under no 
circumstances afford the tuition fee, every community maintained a 
public school called Talmud Torah (study of the law) in which the 
elements of Judaism were imparted. In spite of the fact, or perhaps 
owing to the fact, that these schools were under the supervision of the 
Jewish community, they were the least successful and least esteemed 
type of educational institution. Only the poorest of the poor and 
those that formed the very dregs of Russian Jewish society availed 
themselves of this educational agency. 
The educational institutions, as outlined above, suffered no doubt 
from many serious, nay fundamental, defects and they have often 
been subjected, particularly by those who passed over to secu- 
lar education, to violent and even passionate criticism. Yet, 
on cool reflection, one must admit that they were thoroughly 
successful, for they fulfilled the purpose for which they were created, 
which was to perpetuate the peculiar ideals of the Russian Jewish 
community. And much as we may feel inclined and, indeed, are 
forced to condemn them when applying modern standards, we must 
not overlook the great fact that, largely through their instrumen- 
tality, one of the most unfortunate sections of humanity, ground by 
indescribable poverty and crushed by the heavy hand of an un- 
friendly Government, has become and still remains one of the most 
intellectually alert and one of the most anxious, nay greedy, for the 
light of knowledge and intellectual advancement. 
A world new in every manifestation—No particular penetration 
or study is necessary to realize the terrible chaos in which the Rus- 
sian Jewish immigrants found themselves when, on touching these 
hospitable shores, they were confronted by the completely different, 
nay diametrically opposite conditions of American life. The whole 
elaborate structure of Russian Jewish life seemed to tumble like a 
card house on the first touch with American reality. Everything 
in the new environment, the radically different standards and ideals 
of a highly industrialized community, the political, freedom, the 
utterly different attitude of the neighboring population, the demands 
of general education which characteristically enough the Russian 
Jew immediately accepted as a matter of course, although in his 
native land he had shunned them, and at the top, and perhaps at the 
bottom of it all, the fierce economic struggle of the newcomers with 
the infinitely greater prospects of success which it held forth for 
them—all these circumstances were equally bound to revolutionize 
their time-honored ideas and ideals. America was to them, in the 
literal sense of the word, a new world, new not only geographically,

-P-A-G-E-429
THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 875 
but also economically, socially, politically, and religiously, new in 
every manifestation of life; and it is no exaggeration to say that in 
no other class of immigrants, not even among those from the Far 
East, has the painful process of adaptation assumed such tragic 
proportions as among the Russian Jews. For, having no land or 
Government to fall back upon, they come to this country with the in- 
tention to stay, and with the genuine desire to become part and parcel 
of this Republic. No wonder, therefore, that many of the immi- 
grants, realizing the hopelessness of adapting Judaism (the Judaism 
such as they knew it) to the new environment, threw up their hands 
in despair and left the growing generation to their fate. The result 
was that within a few years there was created a gulf between parents 
and children which could no more be bridged, and which is undoubt- 
edly the source of the innumerable tragedies in the inner life of the 
Russian Jews in this country. 
There were others, however, who, with heavy hearts and hoping 
against hope, decided to make a stand for what they rightly consid- 
ered to be their most sacred duty as Jews. But not knowing how 
to modify their old traditional standards in accordance with the new 
conditions, they proceeded to reproduce the religious and educational 
institutions of Russian Jewish life exactly in the same form which 
they had had in the “old country.” This disastrous policy was, in 
part, encouraged by the attempts made by the earlier Jewish settlers, 
by the so-called German Jews, to Americanize the newcomers. Well- 
meant and prompted by generous motives as these attempts no doubt 
were, they probably did more harm than good. For, instead of try- 
ing to preserve all that was valuable in the mental make-up of the 
Russian Jew—and much of it was of high and lasting value, even 
in the new environment—and, instead of adapting it gently and 
cautiously to the new conditions, these attempts, rudely ignoring the 
peculiar individuality of the Russian Jew, proceeded to hammer it 
by force into the mould of American life. No wonder that they some- 
times resulted in making the Russian Jew reject all that was valuable 
in his own culture and adopt that which was superficial and least 
valuable in the new culture. As a consequence, the Russian Jews as a 
whole learned to look askance at all these attempts at Americaniza- 
tion, much as they favored Americanization in itself, and they re- 
fused to accept even those modifications of Jewish life which might 
have proved beneficial for the preservation of Judaism in this country. 
Transplanted agencies fail to thrive—tLeft then to their own 
resources, the Russian Jewish immigrants endeavored to reproduce 
the religious, and what interests us here particularly, the educational 
agencies of Russian Jewish life. But, with all their loyalty to their 
traditions, it was obvious that a complete reproduction was impossible. 
The downfall of the central pillar that had supported the structure
-P-A-G-E-430
    376 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of Russian Jewish life, the ideal of religious knowledge or scholar- 
ship, involved the downfall of all those institutions which had served 
it. Hence the beth hamidrash and the yeshibah were doomed from 
the beginning, and, though attempts at reproducing them have been 
made, they did not yield any tangible results. Even the advanced 
heder, which had for its purpose the difficult study of the Talmud, 
had no place in the new surroundings, in which the best energy of the’ 
growing generation was requisitioned either for general education or 
for the economic struggle. Asa result only the elementary heder and 
the Talmud torah, the two institutions which limited themselves to im- 
parting the fundamentals of Judaism came to the forefront, and these 
institutions became the more important, since, on account of the 
economic struggle and other causes, the Jewish home which had 
always been the power house of the Jewish religion lost much of its 
influence as an educational factor among the Jewish people. 
‘We now understand the reason why the heder became, and indeed 
has remained, a favorite institution among the Russian Jewish immi- 
grants. According to recent calculations there are about 1,000 heders 
in this country, with an annual budget of about $600,000; half of 
them are in New York City. Yet, no one, not even among the most 
optimistic or most orthodox, doubts that the heder is a complete 
failure in this country. Its inherent defects, which in the atmosphere 
of Russian Jewish life were already noticeable but bearable, are .a 
terrible anomaly in the new environment. The long hours of study 
which were an indispensable condition of their success in Russia 
are impossible in this country in which the public school claims the 
best time and energy of the child. The unhygienic and even repul- 
sive external condition of the heder, which was scarcely felt in 
Russia, has had the inevitable result to make the instruction imparted 
in it repulsive to the American child, who judges it by the standards 
of the public school. From these facts alone, not to speak of other 
numerous causes, it is obvious and is indeed admitted on all hands 
that the heder has no chance whatsoever and does not even offer the 
possibility of improvement. 
An unexpected development was in store for the last type of 
Russian Jewish educational agencies—the Talmud torah. This insti- 
tution which occupied the lowest rung in the educational ladder is 
gradually climbing to the top. The success of the Talmud torah 
is mainly due to the fact that it is a large school and as such is better 
fitted to cope with the large numbers in the congested Jewish centers, 
and is at least potentially able to adopt and adapt the methods and 
externalities of the American public school. The first Talmud torah 
in New York City was founded in the early eighties, but with all 
its potentialities this type of school has not yet fully worked out. 
The Talmud torah in this country was originally designed, as had
-P-A-G-E-431
THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 377 
been the case in Russia, to accommodate the poor children who ean 
not pay, and it has not yet fully emancipated itself from this objec- 
tionable character as a charitable institution. Demanding, as they 
do, a large budget, which can only be obtained by organized effort, : | 
they are far from meeting the educational situation, not to speak | 
of the numerous internal evils to which reference will be made later. 
It is enough to point out the dry fact that of the 200,000 Jewish 
school children at present in New York, only 11,000 are taught in 
Talmud torahs. 
After what was said of the position of woman in Jewish education 
in Russia it will scarcely be necessary to add that until very recently 
practically no provision was made for the religious instruction of 
the girls, although it is conceded by all that in this country the 
Jewish woman is destined to play an important role in Jewish re- 
ligious life. 
JEWISH EDUCATION NOW A COMPLICATED PROBLEM.   The above facts clearly show that, in spite of all educational en- 
deavors, which in view of the extraordinary difficulties confronting 
them rather deserve our praise than our criticism, the problem of 
Jewish education which has been enormously complicated by the 
third and largest Jewish immigration to America is further from its 
solution than it had ever been before. A few figures will illustrate 
the magnitude of the problem. The last census of Jewish institu- 
tions was made in 1908, and was presented in the “American Jewish 
Year Book” for that year. Analyzing the data bearing on Jewish 
education, Dr. S. Benderly, of whom more will be said hereafter, 
arrived at the following figures which, of course, will have to be | 
modified according to the steady increase in the numbers of the | 
Jewish populations Counting the Jewish population of the United 
States as 1,800,000, he estimated at 360,000 the number of Jewish 
school children in 1908. Of these, 26,560 received instruction in 
235 Sunday schools with one session weekly; 9,551 were taught in 
92 congregational schools with two, very seldom three, sessions 
weekly ; and 26,216 attended 236 daily schools (Talmud torahs). The 
number of boys taught in heders (for which no data were available), 
including those who received private instruction at home, was com- 
puted roughly by Dr. Benderly to be 40,000. The total number of 
children, then, who in 1908 received Jewish religious instruction, 
amounted altogether to about 100,000; so that fully 260,000, among 
them probably 170.000 girls, were left without any religious instruc- 
tion whatsoever. Taking into consideration that none of these types 
of schools admittedly came up to the educational standards. even as

58.  
-P-A-G-E-432
  878 EDUCATION REPORT, 191, 
modified in this country, the terrible significance of these figures 
from the religious point of view becomes apparent. 
But not only from the religious point of view. The lack of all 
religious instruction and consequently of all religious idealism, the 
inevitable weakening of moral self-restraint which threatens to result 
from it, the terrible cleavage between parents and children, and the 
consequent loss of parental authority which has thus been brought 
about, the materialization of Jewish life, which is in crying contrast 
to all Jewish traditions and is particularly dangerous in an enyiron- 
mert with a highly developed industrial life, all these facts, added to 
the natural solicitude for the preservation of Judaism, could not fail 
to arrest the attention of all those who were seriously interested in 
the welfare of the Jewish community in America. 
Numerous symptoms heralded this awakening of American Jews 
to one of the prime necessities of Jewish life. For the first time, in 
several large cities systematic endeavors were made to collect educa- 
tional statistics as the first step to cope with the problem. A number 
of new Talmud torahs were established. At the graduation exercises 
of the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1905, its president, Prof. 
Solomon Shechter, emphasized the fact that, while several higher 
institutions of learning had been provided for the education of the 
few (for one out of one thousand), no adequate provision was made 
for the nine hundred and ninety-nine remaining; and the same point 
was dwelt upon on the same occasion by Dr. Cyrus Adler. Shortly 
afterwards, through the munificence of Mr. Jacob H. Schiff, the 
Teachers’ Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary, and a sim- 
ilar institution, under the auspices of the Hebrew Union College in 
Cincinnati, were established. In New York City the various Talmud 
torahs, among which there had been no cooperation whatsoever, made 
an attempt, though it remained a platonic one, to organize a central 
board of Talmud torahs. 
DIFFICULTIES PECULIAR TO NEW YORK CITY. 
It goes without saying that difficult and extensive as the problem 
of Jewish education was throughout the country, it was nowhere 
more difficult and more extensive than in New York City. For New 
York City contains almost a half of American Jewry and forms the 
port of entry where the immigrant comes face to face with the con- 
ditions of the new environment. The Jewry of New York, indeed, 
presents, on account of its vast-and congested population, unique 
problems of religious organization. The religious and educational 
chaos which, as was indicated above, was the inevitable result of a 
chaotic immigration, was greater here than elsewhere. It was, there- 
fore, natural that the first attempt to cope with this situation should 
be made in New York. In 1909 a large number of Jewish organiza-
-P-A-G-E-433
  THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 879 
tions formed the Jewish community (Kehillah) of New York City 
for the purpose of religious organization, under the chairmanship of 
Dr. J. L. Magnes. It is a significant fact that one of the very first 
steps of the new organization was to investigate the status of re- 
ligious education in New York City. Already at the first convention 
of the community (February 26 and 27, 1910) Prof. Mordecai M. 
Kaplan, the then chairman of the committee on education, presented 
a report of this investigation, which made a deep impression. He 
showed that, out of a computed Jewish school population of 170,000 
(in 1909), only 41,404 were taught in some kind of Jewish educa- 
tional institution—of these almost a third (13,532) went to heders— 
while, even if we make allowance for those taught privately at home, 
two-thirds were left without a knowledge of Judaism and its re- 
ligious institutions. Prof, Kaplan summed up his report in the 
following discouraging sentences : 
1. The demand for Jewish education is comparatively small." 2. Small as 
the demand is, the means and equipment which we possess at present are far 
too inadequate to meet it. 8. Wherever that demand is met, there is a lack 
of system or of content. 
MEANS FOR IMPROVEMENT. 
Fortunately this educational inquiry aroused more than fruitless 
apprehensions. At the same convention of the Jewish community the 
chairman, Dr. J. L. Magnes, was able to announce that Mr. Jacob H. 
Schiff had donated the sum of $50,000 to be distributed over five years 
for the purpose of improving and promoting Jewish religious pri- 
mary education in New York City; and soon afterwards a sum of 
$25,000 was added by the New York Foundation? for the same 
purpose. 
Having obtained these gifts, Dr. Magnes addressed himself to 
Dr. S. Benderly, a Jewish pedagogue in Baltimore, for an expres- 
sion of opinion as to the best use of these funds. 
The inquiry of Dr. Magnes was answered by Dr. Benderly in a 
statement which subsequently appeared as Bulletin No. I of the 
Jewish Community of New York City. Since the ideas contained in 
this statement became afterwards the guiding principles of the Jewish 
Bureau of Education, the following sentences may be quoted as 
illustrating the attitude of this organization toward the problem 
from the very beginning: 
  Never before in Jewish history has so large a Jewish community as we 
form in this country had both the opportunity and the responsibility of proy- 
ing that the essentials of Judaism, so far from being in contradiction to the

in the hitherto established educational institutions.

educational and social purposes.

   380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
cardinal elements of modern civilization, are complementary to them, the two 
sides being mutually indispensable to each other. Constituting an integral 
part of the Republic, we are under obligation to demonstrate that the prin- 
ciples for which Israel fought and bled over two thousand years are perfectly 
compatible with and essential to the fundamental principles upon which the 
American nation is building a wonderful structure of human liberty and 
happiness. Our obligation is twofold. On the one hand, we must Americanize, 
in the higher sense, every Jew in this country, infusing into him the spirit of 
self-reliance, fair play, and social cooperation; and, on the other hand, we 
must build up the structure of Jewish life, so as not only to enable ourselves 
to hold our own, Jewishly speaking, but also to become an indispensable ele- 
ment in the progress of the country. 
As the great public school system is the rock bottom upon which this country 
is rearing its institutions, so we Jews must evolve here a system of Jewish 
education that shall be complementary to and harmonious with the public 
system. 
Speaking of the practical difficulties of the problem, Dr. Benderly 
continues: 
First looms up what I would call the hygienic phase of Jewish religious edu- 
cation. We have to deal with children that spend practically the entire day 
in the public schools, and come to the Hebrew school fatigued both in body 
and mind. This is the fact that has given birth to the Jewish Sunday school, 
and now the more serious students and well-wishers of the Sunday school 
system realize that, because of the limited time at its disposal, it has no 
future. On the other hand, the Talmud torahs and chadarim [heders] confine 
weary children for two hours or more daily, which is undoubtedly detrimental 
to the health of the children; and the Jews living in congested areas, in New 
York in particular, can ill afford to invite a curtailing of vitality. The ques- 
tion at once arises: Is it possible to work out a course of religious instruction 
that shall enable us to reduce the number of hours needed for Hebrew instruc- 
tion by half, and that shall at the same time be exhilarating enough to evoke 
a response from tired children? 
  Discussing the financial phase of the problem, Dr. Benderly 
pointed out+ that to provide school buildings for the Jewish school 
population of New York would demand an investment of $16,000,000, 
an annual expenditure of $3,000,000 for teaching, an army of 3,000 
teachers, not to speak of the annual increase of 8,000 children, who 
would demand an additional annual investment in school buildings 
of $640,000, an additional annual outlay of $120,000 for teaching, and 
an additional annual supply of 200 teachers. The mere magnitude of 
this phase of the educational problem makes it clear that our hope 
lies with the people themselves, and that the parents must support 
the schools. Dr. Benderly, therefore, suggested that the fund placed 
at the disposal of the Jewish community should not be spent in prop- 
ping up certain existing institutions, but should be used as a lever 
for the study and improvement of primary Jewish education in New

York City as a whole. He proposed the establishment of a bureau 
for Jewish education having the following objects: 
1. To study the Jewish educational forces in New York City with a view to 
cooperation and the elimination of waste and overlapping. 
2. To get in touch with the best teachers and workers and to organize them 
for their material and spiritual advancement. 
3. To carry on a propaganda in order to acquaint the Jews of New York with 
the problem of Jewish education and with the means of solving it. 
4. To operate one or two model schools for elementary pupils for the purpose 
of working out in practice the various phases of primary Jewish education. 
THE JEWISH BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
The plan formulated by Dr. Benderly was submitted, through Dr. 
Magnes, to the executive committee of the Jewish community of New 
York City, which adopted it and elected a board of five trustees to 
take charge of the new organization for a period of five years. The 
trustees, in turn, appointed Dr. Benderly director. The bureau was 
formally opened October 1, 1910. 
From what was said and quoted in the foregoing, the general 
tendency of the bureau will have become clear. With the limited 
sum at its disposal and the enormous problem before it, the bureau 
realized from the very beginning that it could not cope singlehanded 
with it and could not even dream of filling the enormous void which 
had been created in Jewish education. Its primary function was to 
reawaken the inherent love of Judaism and Jewish education which 
had been so typical of old-fashioned Jewish life, and after calling 
forth the dormant energies of the community to direct and to sys- 
tematize them. It also saw the necessity of making wise and cau- 
tious use of the educational factors already in existence, as far as 
they were sound and offered possibilities of improvement, and alto- 
gether to seek the sympathy and cooperation of the community. 
This policy of the bureau, which consciously placed itself at the 
service of the whole Jewry of New York, also determined its attitude 
toward the religious and other numerous questions which must natu- 
rally divide a community of such vast magnitude and such hetero- 
geneous composition. While planting itself firmly on the broad 
basis of the perpetuation of Judaism, without which the bureau, as 
indeed all Jewish education, would have no reason for existence, it 
concentrated its attention on the pedagogic and financial improye- 
ment of Jewish education and decided to leave to the various schools 
and elements with which cooperation might be established the work- 
ing out of their own particular religious or other policies. 
The first step of the bureau was to get into personal touch with the 
Jewish educational agencies in New York City. In examining the 
various types of these institutions the bureau soon realized that the   
   
-P-A-G-E-436
    382 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
heder offered no possibility of improvement and that the task to 
adapt it to the new environment was hopeless. It therefore, without 
any attempt at reform or criticism, quietly abandoned it to its fate. 
The congregational schools, including the Sunday schools, did not 
lend themselves as the first objects of systematization, owing to their 
dependence upon their congregational organizations and the un- 
avoidable congregational policies. An important educational factor 
was represented in New York City by the so-called “ institutional 
schools,” the most important among them being the Religious School 
of the Educational Alliance, an institution for the improvement of 
immigrants, with an enrollment of 2,000 pupils, and that of the 
Hebrew Orphan Asylum, with an enrollment of 1,200, both institu- 
tions pursuing broader educational purposes. . These schools could 
not form the prop of an educational system, as they were only the 
adjuncts of separate and entirely distinct institutions. 
THE TALMUD TORAHS SELECTED FOR PERPETUATION. 
The attention of the bureau was gradually drawn toward the 
Talmud torahs, which, with all their inherent defects, offered the 
best available means for the systematization of Jewish education. 
Again, of the 24 Talmud torahs which were found in New York, the 
majority were by their number of pupils and their external condi- 
tions more in the nature of a heder, and shared with it most of its 
defects. Hence, in casting about for the building material for the 
future structure of Jewish education, the attention of the bureau 
was riveted on the large Talmud torahs. 
The most striking defect of these institutions, considered as a class, 
was their lack of uniformity. Every Talmud torah was an inde- 
pendent institution and pursued its own methods, or lack of methods, 
without the slightest regard to the efforts of its sister institutions. 
In view of the constant shifting of the Jewish population in New 
York, their lack of uniformity was fatal, as very few children stayed 
throughout the entire course in one Talmud torah, and, when moving 
to a different section, even if they were fortunate enough to find there 
another Talmud torah, they had to start all over again. <A central 
board of Talmud torahs had indeed been formed, but, hampered by 
the complete lack of means and without authority, it accomplished 
nothing. At the suggestion and with the constant cooperation of the 
bureau, the principals of the largest Talmud torahs came together 
for the first time, and in a long series of conferences elaborated a 
uniform curriculum. The results of these conferences, which were 
the first attempt at systematic cooperation in the field of Jewish edu- 
cation, were subsequently published by the bureaus ~

THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 883 
THE PLAN OF THE CURRICULUM. 
Of the numerous resolutions passed by the principals, the follow- 
ing may be of more general interest. The aim of Jewish education 
was formulated to be “the preservation of the Jews as a distinct 
people, existing and developing in the spirit of the Jewish religion.” 
The plan of parochial Jewish schools was rejected, on the ground 
that it was undesirable for the Jews from the civic point of view and 
was surrounded by insurmountable practical difficulti 
The curriculum of the Talmud torahs was planned to extend over 
seven years and to pursue the following subjects: . 
  A sufficient knowledge of Hebrew, which should enable the children to under- 
stand the prayers, the Pentateuch, the historical portions of the Bible, selections 
from the Prophets and Hagiographa, selections from the Mishnah, the exsier 
Midrashim [religious homiletic works], some portions of the Talmud, and some 
specimens of medizeval Jewish poetry; Jewish history, ancient and modern, and 
an acquaintance with Jewish religious observances. 
It can be seen at a glance that this curriculum stands midway be- 
tween the high and, in this country, unapproachable standards of 
Jewish education in Russia, on the one hand, and the meager require- 
ments of the Jewish Sunday school on the other. 
Greater emphasis than before was laid on the hygienic phase of 
the problem, which was particularly difficult owing to the supple- 
mentary character of Jewish education, and a number of improve- 
ments were suggested to make Jewish instruction more wholesome 
and attractive to the children taxed by the public school. Definite 
requirements were laid down for the Jewish teachers, and in many 
other respects an agreement was reached for a united course of action. 
But it soon became apparent that the plan thus worked out would 
remain without practical effect as long as there was no external 
pressure or inducement which would make the principals and di- 
rectors of the institutions comply with the standards formulated. 
As a matter of fact, the precarious financial condition of the Talmud 
torahs made in many cases a compliance with these standards im- 
possible. Thus, to mention but one factor, the average pay of the   
1It may be of interest to add here a few further details of the curriculum as worked 
out in the series of textbooks prepared by the bureau for the Talmud torahs and schools 
with a similar program. The curriculum, which extends over seven years (between the 
ages of 7 and 14), is divided into three parts. Part I (first and second year) is merely 
of a preparatory nature. The aim is to give the children a sufficient knowledge of 
Hebrew to take up the Bible in the original; to acquaint them with the stories of Jewish 
heroes and to teach them the simple prayers and Jewish melodies. Part II (third, fourth, 
and fifth year) is mainly devoted to the study of the Bible in the original, the rest of the 
time being given to the study of the prayers. Part III (sixth and seventh year) deals 
mainly with post-biblical literature and history. During the last five years the cur- 
riculum is supplemented by a course of collateral reading which is correlated with the 
lessons in the classroom, The material for the collateral reading is bound with the text- 
books. The whole ground is divided into 2,800 recitations of 30 minutes each (400 
recitations, or 200 hours per year). The school year consists of 40 weeks; so that the 
curriculum calls for 5 hours a week, besides children’s Sabbath service (one hour).
-P-A-G-E-438
    384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Talmud torah teachers, many of whom were married and had large 
families, was found to be $38.33 per month. They were, in con- 
sequence, forced to look out for an additional livelihood, which 
paralyzed their pedagogic usefulness. It was obvious, then, that no 
satisfactory curriculum could be adopted and carried out as long as 
the financial status of the Talmud torah was not placed on a sounder 
basis. Hence the bureau very soon turned its attention in this 
direction. 
FINANCIAL COOPERATION. 
The financial survey subsequently made by the bureau? brought 
out, among others, the following interesting facts: In the 24 Talmud 
torahs existing in New York City 10,710 children were taught. The 
eight largest, with an enrollment of 7,050 pupils, spent a little over 
$100,000 per annum. ‘This sum is derived from various sources, the 
most important being regular membership dues yielding 23.9 per 
cent of the income, occasional donations amounting to 15.6 per cent, 
and tuition fees from the less poor children to the extent of 28.4 per 
cent. On analyzing these figures it was found that, although the 
Talmud torahs had originally been charity schools and were designed 
as such even when transferred to this country, the largest part of 
that burden was carried by the poor. Of the 6,641 members, whose 
" dues amounted to $27,059, fully 4,963 paid only from $1 to $3 per 
annum, and the low financial condition of these contributors may be 
gauged from the fact that no less than 4,507 of this number paid 
their dues in small, often weekly, installments. Only 61 paid be- 
tween $11 and $25, and not more than 13 contributed over $25 an- 
nually. The peculiar character of this source of income had also 
other disadvantages. Thus the cost of collecting the membership 
dues was as high as 20 per cent, while the collection of the tuition 
fees, which was made by the teachers in the school through the 
medium of the children, had a demoralizing effect on both pupils 
and teachers and on the instruction. In one of the Talmud torahs 
it has been calculated that the amount of time involved in this pe- 
culiar method of collection represented a larger financial loss than 
the sum collected. Thus it was found that practically all the Talmud 
torahs were in a struggling financial condition, which made their 
existence precarious and their progress impossible. 
It needed no penetration to realize that, in order to remedy the 
pedagogic evils of the Talmud torahs, it was necessary first to remedy 
their financial shortcomings. This, however, could only be accom- 
plished by means of a fund to be applied to purposes of standardiza- 
tion.

THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 885 
The need of such a fund had already forced itself upon the attention 
of the bureau as a result of its other activities. The bureau, in con- 
sequence, proposed the collection of an education fund, which, begin- 
ning with $50,000, should within 10 years rise to $300,000 per annum. 
Tt was obvious that this money could only come from the better situ- 
ated classes. Dr. Magnes, the chairman of the community, took the 
matter in hand and met with rapid success. For the first time in 
American-Jewish history was such a fund started in such a fashion, 
and the result showed that the Jewish community needed only to be 
awakened to the importance of the educational problem before it. 
The bureau was now able to enter upon a more permanent form of 
cooperation with the Talmud torahs. 
The per capita cost of Jewish teaching had been found to be $15 
per annum. Accordingly, the pupils of the Talmud torahs were 
divided into three groups: Those that paid the full tuition fee ($1.25 
per month) and were no drain on the financial resources of the 
school, those who paid half (65 cents per month), and those who 
could pay nothing. The last-named class represented the crux of the 
problem, and the bureau, therefore, undertook to shoulder the bur- 
den by paying the tuition for these free pupils, provided they did 
not exceed, as they ought not to, a third of the entire school popu- 
lation of a given school. In this way, the bureau hoped to combat 
the deep-seated prejudice against the Talmud torahs as charity in- 
stitutions; and by bringing the poor and better-off children together, 
to infuse into the schools the democratic spirit of the public school. 
  PROVISIONS FOR STANDARDIZATION. 
In return for its assistance the bureau, with a view to the attain- 
ment of greater efficiency and uniformity, imposed the following 
conditions: 1. The pupils are to be investigated by the bureau in 
their homes, to determine the financial group to which they belong. 
2. The tuition fee is to be collected by the bureau in the homes of the 
children in monthly installments and the objectionable methods of 
collection hitherto practiced are to be discontinued. 3. The curric- 
ulum above referred to, which shortly before had been worked out _ 
by the principals, is to be adopted uniformly in all the schools, pro- 
vision being made for future necessary modifications, in accordance 
with a definite method of procedure. 4. No teacher shall be em- 
ployed by the Talmud torahs unless he obtain a temporary certificate 
from the board of license instituted by the bureau, this temporary 
certificate to be exchanged for a permanent license at the end of three 
years. 5. The initial salary of the teachers to be $60 per month 
($720 per annum), and to rise gradually within a period of four 
years to $80 per month ($960 per annum).

  386 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Tt has already been pointed out that from the very beginning the 
Bureau of Education centered its attention on the larger schools, 
which in its opinion were best adapted to the conditions of this coun- 
try, and particularly of New York City. The same point of view 
guided the bureau in its application of the new fund. It was forced 
to disregard the cry of assistance which came from the smaller 
schools whose financial condition was distressing, but hopeless. Three 
prerequisites were fixed for its grant of financial aid: A minimum 
school enrollment of 500, a separate building, and a stable organi- 
zation. 
At present all the educational institutions in New York City con- 
sidered by the bureau to be fit for standardization are affiliated with 
it. In addition, a number of schools outside of New York cooperate 
with the bureau in various ways, and a still larger number in differ- 
ent parts of the country profit by its advice and experience. 
RESULTS ACHIEVED, 
The results of this activity were not slow’to show themselves. 
The success of the endeavor of the bureau to change the status of 
Talmud torahs from charity schools to self-supporting institutions 
may be gauged from the following facts: Six of these institutions 
with which the bureau cooperates collected $20,107.01 in tuition fees 
during the scholastic year 1910-11, prior to the advent of the 
bureau. The same institutions, in which the number of children has 
increased only 2 per cent, have collected $35,962.80 through the 
medium of the bureau during the present scholastic year (1912-13), 
an increase of 79 per cent. The new method of collecting the tuition 
fees in the homes of the children has had no less substantial spir- 
itual advantages, for not only has it put a stop to the obnoxious 
methods formerly in vogue, but the monthly collection in the homes 
carried on by a carefully selected corps of college men has also 
offered an excellent medium of educational propaganda among the 
Jews of New York. 
In this connection it may also be mentioned that, in addition to its 
department of collection, the bureau has worked out a complete 
truancy system, which carefully follows up the attendance of the 
children in the schools cooperating with it and endeavors to locate 
and reduce the sources of the enormous leakage from which these 
institutions formerly suffered. The investigators employed for this 
purpose are distinct from the collectors, but they likewise serve as an 
effective medium of educational propaganda by keeping the parents 
in touch with the schools attended by their children. The greater 
interest and sympathy which are to be observed recently in the field 
of Jewish education are, at least in New York, due largely to these 
endeavors of the bureau.
-P-A-G-E-441
      THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 387 
The pedagogic results of this policy of the bureau can not, of 
course, be put down in figures, but they are no less substantial. 
There is a tendency toward cooperation and mutual helpfulness 
among the various educational factors which was formerly lacking. 
The status, and with it the self-respect and the efficiency, of the 
teachers has been considerably raised, and this new spirit of hope- 
fulness and enthusiasm must naturally exert a beneficent effect upon 
all the phases of educational endeavor. 
Of course, encouraging as these results undoubtedly are, they have 
succeeded in affecting the status of the Talmud torahs qualitatively 
but not quantitively. Only a little over 5 per cent of the Jewish 
school population of New York has thus far found accommodation 
in this type of school. The necessity of a vast number of additional 
Talmud torahs is obvious. But the Jewish community seems to be 
awake to this need, and the bureau has worked out a plan which will 
tend not only to stimulate, but also to organize the efforts of the 
community in this direction. 
“ PREPARATORY SCHOOLS.” 
One of the aims formulated in the program of the bureau was to 
create, in addition to the standardization of existing institutions, a 
few model schools in which the various phases of the problem, as 
affecting New York City, were to be elaborated, and to place the 
results of these experiments at the disposal of all other schools. 
Three such schools, to which the name of “ preparatory school” was 
given, have been established by the bureau, with an enrollment of 
1,200 children. Owing to the fact that the girls were practically 
barred from the Talmud torahs and from a number of other schools 
and that Jewish female education had been sorely neglected, the 
bureau has gradually limited these schools to girls. In addition to 
their serving as places of observation and practice, the preparatory 
schools, as will be pointed out later, were also designed with a view 
to helping in the solution of the difficult problem of Jewish teachers. 
The pupils of these institutions were selected, with this purpose in 
mind, from the higher grades in public schools, and in this selection 
the bureau was fortunate enough to benefit by the sympathetic co- 
operation of the public-school system. The program of these schools 
was practically placed on the same level as that of the Talmud 
torahs—an unheard-of innovation in Jewish education, which had 
hitherto paid little or no attention to girls—except that on account 
of the more advanced age of the children (from 12 to 16) they are 
expected to cover the ground in almost half the time. 
One of the conspicuous features of these schools is the distribution 
of the hours of instruction by utilizing not only Sunday, but also 
Saturday, when the children are free from public school. The six   
-P-A-G-E-442
   
   388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
hours of weekly instruction are equally divided over Saturday, 
Sunday, and one week-day afternoon. This arrangement avoids 
one of the most serious drawbacks of Jewish education, the conflict 
with the public school, and by utilizing for the first time the Jewish 
Sabbath, restores to it its old traditional character as a day of 
religious study and meditation. This arrangement is also of vital 
importance from a financial point of view, for it enables the teacher 
to handle four classes in the same classroom in rotation, and thus to 
take charge of about 100 children. Moreover, a considerable saving 
is effected by the greater use of the classrooms thus made possible. 
Finally, this arrangement is important for the solution of the teach- 
ers’ problem, for it gives the Jewish teacher sufficient scope to make 
Jewish instruction his profession and life work. 
TEXTBOOKS AND METHODS. 
A regular curriculum is impossible without textbooks. Yet, 
strange as it seems, Jewish education until very recently was without 
them. The prayer book, the Bible, and the Talmud, exactly in the 
same form in which they were used by the adults, were placed before 
the children. At an age when the modern child still depends on 
primers the Jewish boy was made familiar with the theological con- 
ceptions of the prophets or the subtleties of civil and even marital 
law as contained in the Talmud. In recent years, however, owing 
to certain tendencies in Jewish life, a marked change has taken place 
which has resulted in the production of a vast number of textbooks, 
particularly in Russia. But being the outcome of individual en- 
deavor, they are disconnected and offer no graded or systematic 
series. Moreover, having been written abroad and designed for 
g@astly different conditions, practically none of these books fits in 
completely with the requirements as they have arisen in this country. 
An additional difficulty, which is by no means insignificant, is found 
in the fact that the make-up of these books is far below the American 
standards of book production to which the child is accustomed in the 
public school. Hence the need of a graded, well-printed, properly 
bound, and adequately illustrated series of textbooks, which should 
adapt itself to the limited time at the disposal of the child and keep 
pace with its mental progress in the general school, was early for- 
mulated by the bureau. The projected textbook series, which is to 
cover a curriculum of seven years, is to consist of 28 books for the 
pupils, accompanied by a corresponding number of guides for the 
teachers. The former are so arranged that each book is to be coy- 
ered in three months; the latter contain supplementary material, 
bibliography, suggestions, and model lessons. Particular attention 
is given to the appearance of the books. It may be mentioned as a 
detail that every year is marked by a separate color of the binding.    
-P-A-G-E-443
THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 389 
The work in this direction has progressed systematically, until 
now (October, 1913) the bureau has worked out the textbooks for 
. the first three years of the curriculum. 
It would lead us too far to dwell on a number of other experi- 
ments of the bureau in the field of textbook and general juvenile 
literature, but one aspect of this work may be of interest to the gen- 
eral reader. : 
The most important, and at the same time the most difficult, sub- 
ject of instruction in a Jewish school is the Hebrew language. The 
overwhelming majority of Jews look upon Hebrew as inseparable 
from the Jewish religion. It is the language in which the prayers 
are recited and the Bible is read weekly in the synagogues, not to 
speak of the immeasurable post-Biblical literature to which Hebrew 
alone can provide the key. It is not a spoken language, the ver- 
nacular of the majority of Jews being the Yiddish dialect; neither is 
it a dead language. For, apart from its primary function as a re- 
ligious medium, it has been, and in Russia still is, the language of 
culture and literature; it is vastly used as a medium of correspond- 
ence, and has produced in the past century a considerable secular 
literature and press. The intensiveness of Jewish education in Rus- 
sia brought it about that, although studied like every ancient lan- 
guage by the translation method (translating the Hebrew original 
into Yiddish, a method still followed in the heders in this country), 
it is widely understood in the various functions referred to. 
In recent times, under the influence of Zionism, the Hebrew lan- 
guage, which had ceased to be spoken nearly 2,000 years ago, has 
been restored as a vernacular’in Palestine. In consequence the at- 
tempt was made to teach Hebrew by the so-called natural or Berlitz 
method, generally designated by Jewish pedagogues as Ibrith be- 
Ibrith (Hebrew in Hebrew). This method has been largely followed 
by modern pedagogues in Russia, and in some cases in this country. 
At the conferences of the principals of the Talmud torahs mentioned 
above, the natural method was elaborately discussed and finally 
adopted, not only on its general pedagogic merits but also on the 
ground that, by obviating the terribly fatiguing mechanical reading 
and translating of Hebrew and by arousing the interest of the child 
by means of concrete objects and actions, it was particularly appli- 
cable to this country, where the Jewish school can count only on 
the leavings of the children’s time and energy. This method is now 
used in all the schools affiliated with the bureau and forms the basis 
of its textbooks. There is naturally no intention whatsoever to 
make Hebrew a spoken language in this country—such a task would 
be impossible and, if possible, scarcely desirable—but the natural 
method is preferred on the ground that it lightens and considerably 
shortens the difficult road to the understanding of Hebrew as the
-P-A-G-E-444
  
890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
medium of the Jewish religion. The results of the method are care- 
fully watched and will ultimately determine the question of method 
in Jewish education, 
THE PROBLEM OF TEACHERS. 
No phase of Jewish education is more complicated and more serious 
than the problem of teachers. The root of the evil goes back to the 
old-fashioned system of Jewish education in Russia, in which ele- 
mentary teaching, in spite of the boundless passion of the Jews for 
higher Jewish learning, had no status. Instead of being a profes- 
sion with definite training and standards, it was, as formerly in other 
countries and among other nations, merely a makeshift resorted to by 
those who had proved failures in other walks of life. This evil, which 
was minimized by the general religious enthusiasm of Russian Jewish 
life, has been considerably accentuated in this country. What makes 
this problem particularly complicated is the fact that Jewish educa- 
tion in America imperatively demands the combination of a thorough 
English and pedagogic training with an adequate knowledge of 
Hebrew and love of Judaism, a combination which can not be ex- 
pected from an immigrant population. .Furthermore, the higher eco- 
nomic standards in this country offer young men almost everywhere 
better prospects of material success. The demand for Jewish teachers 
is very considerable. In New York alone it amounts to 3,000, with an 
annual increase of 200; and against this demand there is only one 
training school, the Teacher’s Institute of the Jewish Theological 
Seminary, with an enrollment of about 200. While in the Sunday 
schools, with their simplified standards and their comparative neglect 
of Hebrew, Jewish teaching can still depend on volunteers or on 
Jewish public school teachers who treat it as a side issue, the instruc- 
tion of the more intensive type, such as is demanded (at least in 
theory) by the bulk of the Jews, needs the preparation and aptitude 
of a full-fledged calling. Hence the problem arose of making Jewish 
teaching a profession sufficiently remunerative, both morally and 
financially, to attract the capable and ambitious. 
It is a vast problem which can scarcely be handled and still less 
solved by a single organization. The bureau, however, took the ini- 
tiative, indicating the direction in which a solution is to be sought. 
As a first step it insisted on raising considerably the salary of the 
teachers. Prompted by the same motive, it established a board of 
license so as to create definite standards for Jewish teachers, which 
had hitherto been missing, and to keep off the unworthy and inca- 
pable. More important was the task to locate and to increase the 
sources of supply. The bureau found two types of Jewish teachers, 
the immigrant young man, whose only equipment was a thorough 
Jewish education, and the American or Americanized college man,
-P-A-G-E-445
  
THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 391 
whose Hebrew knowledge was inadequate. The bureau endeavored 
to work the problem at both ends. For the former type courses 
in English and pedagogy were instituted; for the latter, classes 
in Hebrew and pedagogy were established as a preparation for 
the teachers’ institute, where they will receive a more systematic 
training. It would be an enormous gain for Jewish education if it 
could systematically draw on the large number of Jewish college 
graduates who often enter professions already overcrowded and who 
might be attracted to Jewish teaching if given adequate preparation 
and encouragement. : : 
With all this, the Bureau of Education early realized that the 
Jewish teacher problem, as the teacher problem in general, could not 
be solved without drawing largely on the female element. While con- 
siderably represented on the staffs of the Sunday schools, the female 
teacher is practically barred from the traditional type of school. 
For to the Jews, who are still dominated by Russian Jewish associa- 
tions, the idea of a woman as a teacher of Judaism seems preposterous. 
But a gradual change is taking place, and there is no doubt that the 
near future will produce a large demand for female teachers, par- 
ticularly in the schools for girls and in the lower grades of the boys’ 
schools. This aspect of the problem had already been a determining 
factor in the establishment of the preparatory schools referred to 
above. While serving primarily as places of observation and prac- 
tice, these schools were so designed as to enable the pupils, at least 
the best and ablest, to pursue an additional course of study in a 
training school. 
More recently an experiment in this direction was made on a 
larger scale. To spread Jewish female education and to increase the 
number of Jewish female teachers, about 500 girls between the ages 
of 14 and 18, attending the high schools of Greater New York, have 
been carefully selected with regard to both their physical and their 
mental fitness and are given an intensive course of study in Jewish 
subjects, with a view to prepare them more efficiently for the tech- 
nical training they are to receive afterwards. 
Of course, the solution of the problem could only be indicated 
by the bureau. Its ultimate solution will have to come from the 
training schools with a vastly increased capacity and perfected 
organization. 
EXTENSION TEACHING. 
The reader who may recollect the figures of the number of Jewish 
children receiving Jewish instruction in New York City will easily 
realize that, in spite ofall efforts, a great number of children for 
many years to come will be unable to receive a regular Jewish 
school education. Here, to a certain extent, lies the gravity of the  
-P-A-G-E-446
    392 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
problem, for it is this unschooled generation which runs the risk not 
only of drifting away from Judaism, but also of becoming a prey to 
the destructive influences of a cosmopolitan street life. To provide 
school buildings for the nearly 150,000 children still barred from 
Jewish schools would alone cost some $10,000,000, not to speak of the 
cost of teaching and maintenance. While, therefore, systematic in- 
struction was out of the question, the bureau has been conducting 
experiments to teach these children in a less comprehensive manner 
the essentials of Judaism. The bureau has been maintaining three 
such centers in large halls in which the children were gathered on 
Sunday mornings for this form of religious lessons. The instruction 
was given by means of slides, which by an ingenious combination of 
type and color were designed to acquaint the children with the most 
important Hebrew responses in the synagogue service. Biblical his- 
tory was taught in a similar fashion. The extension work is still in 
the stage of experiment, but it has no doubt large inherent possi- 
bilities. 
CONCLUSION. 
We have limited ourselves in this sketch to the more important 
aspects of the work of the bureau. But they will suffice to show the 
general trend of its policies and activities. The problem of Jewish 
education will undoubtedly appear insignificant when judged by the 
huge proportions of the general problem of American education. 
Yet it will appear less so, when judged by its own standards as vitally 
affecting a definite section of the population. Similarly, the endeavor 
on the part of the Jewish community to solve the problem, inadequate 
as it is, will be more justly appreciated when it is considered that it 
is merely grafted upon the admittedly keen pursuit of the Jews after 
general education. As far as the work of the bureau is concerned, its 
difficulty lay in the fact that, in coping with the problem, it could 
not fall back on any precedents or models. It was pioneer work, and, 
like every other pioneer work, had to overcome skepticism, hostility, 
and indifference. The bureau has been in existence for only three 
years and is only at the very beginning, but it feels that the beginning 
has been made in the right direction. It is now ready to venture upon 
larger fields. While until recently it was primarily occupied with 
the type of education demanded by the bulk of New York Jewry; 
which consists largely of immigrants, the bureau is now ready to turn 
its attention also to the other types of school created by the earlier 
settlers. For the bureau, looking toward the future, can not desire 
to preserve the existing distinctions among Jews, which are a product 
of the past, and is anxious to help in the perfection and perpetuation 
of the only type possible in this country, that of the American Jew. 
Again, while originally restricted to New York City, the influence
-P-A-G-E-447
  
THE PROBLEM OF JEWISH EDUCATION IN AMERICA. 393 
of the bureau, in the absence of similar educational agencies, is felt 
and will be felt more and more in other Jewish centers. Only very 
recently the bureau has made an attempt, with encouraging results, 
to come into personal contact with a considerable number of outside 
communities, as far west as Kansas City, in which the problem of 
Jewish education, though smaller in extent, is no less serious than in 
New York. The road before the bureau is clear. Its pace will be 
determined by the assistance and encouragement given to it by the 
Jewish community. 
Tn conclusion, it may be said that, while as a Jewish institution the 
bureau is primarily interested in Judaism and in its future and 
progress, it may claim at the same time to serve the broader interests 
of the community at large. For it can not be indifferent to this com- 
munity, whether its Jewish population, by preserving and cherishing 
the great traditions of its past, shall add a distinct contribution to 
the spiritual treasury of the American Nation, or whether, by losing 
its identity, it shall merely become a colorless and hence valueless 
addition to the number of its inhabitants.

  CHAPTER XVII. 
PROGRESS AND CONDITION OF LUTHERAN PAROCHIAL 
SCHOOLS DURING THE CURRENT YEAR. 
By We Ef. DAv, 
Professor, Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Mo. 
The progress of the Lutheran parochial schools during the year 
1912-13 has been normal, and no change has occurred to alter their 
condition in any essential point. 
The fundamental! ideas that enter into a definition of the Lutheran 
parochial school were expressed two generations ago by Prof. Lin- 
dermann, who was at that time principal of the largest Lutheran 
teachers’ seminary in the United States (at Addison, Ill.). He 
helped to educate hundreds of Lutheran parochial school-teachers, 
and his book “ Amerikanisch-Lutherische Schulpraxis” is still the 
standard book on pedagogy in the Lutheran Missouri Synod, which 
conducts 2,216 out of a total of 5,883 Lutheran parochial schools in 
the United States and Canada. He says on page 3 of the second 
edition of his book: 
An Evangelical Lutheran congregational school is formed by the voluntary 
agreement and resolution of a Lutheran parish, or local church organization, to 
gather its children of a prescribed age in a locality, properly fitted up for the 
purpose, to the end of having tliem thoroughly instructed, within certain pre- 
scribed hours, by a common teacher, chiefly and primarily, in the wholesome 
doctrine of the Divine Word according to the Lutheran Confessions, and to 
advance them in true godliness; next, to give them instruction and training, as 
far as practicable, in such knowledge and accomplishments as are necesssary 
for all men in their civil status. 
This definition has become somewhat cumbersome, because the 
author, struggling to embrace every necessary feature in one state- 
ment, had to resort to the involved sentence. The definition, however, 
being genetic and descriptive, is quite serviceable for conveying a 
correct idea of what, in the judgment of Lutherans, constitutes a 
parochial school. Nothing has occurred during the current year that 
would necessitate a revision of this definition. 
The Lutheran parochial school, wherever it exists in our country, 
is still regarded as a voluntary enterprise of a Lutheran congregation. 
The favorite name applied to this school by the church bodies which 
chiefly foster it in the United States is “ congregational school ” (Ger- 
395
-P-A-G-E-450
  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
man, “ Gemeindeschule ”; Norwegian, “ Menigheds skole ”; Swedish, 
“ Forsamlings skola”), There is no constraint practiced in the erec- 
tion and maintenance of these Lutheran congregational schools outside 
of that which the personal religious convictions of the members of 
a Lutheran congregation exercise on them individually. The origin 
of the schools, in nearly every case, is as follows: The members of a 
congregation vote to establish a congregational school, agree to send 
their children to it, appoint a teacher or teachers, and assess them- 
selves for the support of the school. In some cases congregational 
schools have been organized, not by the entire congregation, but by 
a “school society ” within the congregation. There have also been 
instances where several congregations have united in maintaining a 
parochial school, or certain grades of it. Thus, e. g., the Lutheran 
congregations of Oakland, Cal., and vicinity have combined their 
school interests and provide for the teaching of the lower grades in 
cach of the cooperating congregations, while the higher grades are 
taught at a school that is centrally located. The Lutheran congrega- 
tions of Milwaukee some time ago began to discuss a plan by which 
the entire city was to be divided into Lutheran school districts, regard- 
less of parish boundaries, and a school for the teaching of the lower 
grades was to be provided in each school district, while the higher 
grades were to be taught in centrally located schools commanding a 
wider territory. The plan has not yet been put into practice. In 
some of the larger Lutheran communities another plan is being con- 
sidered, viz, to induce the various congregations in the community 
to unite in the erection of. Lutheran high schools, to be conducted 
either in connection with the leading Lutheran school of the commu- 
nity or as a separate cooperative enterprise of the various congrega- 
tions. These efforts also are voluntary in the sense indicated above. 
The means for maintaining the congregational school used to 
be and in many instances still are secured by tuition fees, payable 
monthly as a rule. This fee may be graded according to the class 
or grade which the child enters. The tuition fees, usually very low, 
have hardly ever sufficed to defray the expenses of the school, and 
the deficit is made up by the members of the congregation through 
voluntary contributions. There is a growing tendency, however, 
to abolish all tuition fees and conduct the congregational school as 
a “ free school.” During the present year this tendency has continued 
to strongly assert itself. The cost of maintaining a congregational 
free school is borne by all members of the congregation alike, 
whether they send children to the school or not. The congregational 
school is open also to children whose parents are not members of 
the congregation. Such children, even where the school is a free 
school, may be required to pay a tuition fee, at the discretion of the 
congregation or its officers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-451
  LUTHERAN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 397 
The members of a Lutheran congregation conducting a congrega- 
tional school are expected to send their children to that school in 
preference to any other school; or if for sufficient reasons they do not 
do so, to provide for the religious instruction of their children in a 
private way. It is granted by all Lutherans that the Lutheran con- 
gregational school does not exist by divine right, but is a human 
device to meet an acknowledged need of the church. As such, how- 
ever, it is declared the best means to the proposed end that has 
yet been discovered. Instances have occurred—none during the 
current year—where attendance at the congregational school was 
made compulsory upon children of members, but such attempts have 
always been abandoned after a short time. Moral suasion is the 
only recognized method for dealing with indifferent members to 
induce them to send their children to the congregational school. 
The same method is employed to secure the means for the main- 
tenance of the school. Interest in the congregational school is kept 
alive by special sermons, usually preached about.the time of the 
opening of the schools in fall, by papers on the subject which are 
read before teachers’ and pastors’ conferences, and by articles in 
the official organs of the church. The present year has ‘witnessed 
a strong literary campaign in behalf of congregational schools 
among the Norwegians. An epochal event in the history of congre- 
gational school enterprise is the erection, at a cost of over $200,000, 
of a new teachers’ seminary at River Forest, Ill, by the German 
Missouri Synod. The dedication and opening of this institution is 
set for October 12, 1913. 
The Lutheran congregational schools are popularly known as 
“German schools,” or “ Swedish schools,” or “ Norwegian schools,” 
etc. It is plain from the definition cited above that the use of the 
German language—and this applies with equal force to the Nor- 
wegian, Swedish, Finnish, or any other foreign language—is not 
considered essential, while the teaching of the Lutheran faith is. As 
a matter of fact, there have been, and still are, Lutheran congrega- 
tional schools in which the English language is the sole medium of 
instruction. True, these English congregational schools are pro- 
portionately few in number. But even in German schools English 
is the language. used by teachers and pupils in nine-tenths of the 
studies pursued. In fact, the German language is used only in 
teaching German reading, grammar, and composition, and Bible 
history and Luther’s Small Catechism. Even in religious study, 
which really forms the raison d’etre of these schools, the use of 
English as the medium of instruction is increasing, as the German 
(or Norwegian, Swedish, etc.) congregations are becoming English. 
So-called “ parallel catechisms,” e. g., have been prepared which 
contain the German (or other) text and its English equivalent on
-P-A-G-E-452
    
898 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
opposite pages, and thus facilitate the understanding of the cate- 
chism by children who are better versed in the vernacular of the 
country than in the native tongue of their parents. 
The statement at the head of this article, viz, that the progress 
of the Lutheran parochial schools in the country during the year 
1912-13 has been normal, takes into consideration the working of 
certain natural causes which have always operated in the direction 
of retarding that progress. As long as Lutheran immigrants still 
speak their native language at their homes and in their churches, 
they naturally have a stronger interest in a school which teaches 
that language to their children. Their interest in the parochial 
school frequently wanes when they begin to limit or discard the use 
of their native language in their domestic and churchly relations. 
Sunday schools, which provide only religious instruction, Saturday 
schools, or afternoon schools, which provide for religious instruction 
and instruction in the mother tongue of the children’s parents, are 
then usually substituted for the regular congregational school. 
Another cause that sometimes cuts down attendance at Lutheran 
congregational schools is the double tax that Lutherans pay for 
school purposes: First, the tax levied by the State; and, second, the 
amount with which they have to assess themselves for the support 
of their own congregational school. A movement was begun within 
the German Missouri Synod two years ago to attempt to amend the 
school-tax laws so as to make it possible for Lutheran taxpayers to 
divert the amount, or a part of the amount, which they pay into the 
State treasury to their own schools. The plan is still under discus- 
sion. The manifest purpose of this plan is to relieve Lutheran tax- 
payers. 
Lastly, the general retrogression of the birth rate throughout the 
country has begun to affect the numerical strength of Lutheran con- 
gregational schools. Upon the whole it can be said, however, that the 
Lutheran Church of our country still cherishes the congregational 
school. Applying the motto, “ Our fathers’ faith in our children’s 
language,” the Lutherans who have heretofore maintained congrega- 
tional schools are making strenuous efforts to take these schools over 
into their English future, as they are gradually moving away from 
their German, Norwegian, or Swedish past. 
At an exhibit of the work of the various schools in the city of St. 
Louis, in 1912, a pamphlet inscribed “ Why Lutheran schools?” was 
distributed to visitors. For several reasons this pamphlet is valuable 
to the historian and the sociologist. It shows that the old definition 
of the Lutheran congregational school, which we cited near the head 
of this article, has not been lost sight of in two generations; it ex- 
hibits well the spirit that is back of the Lutheran congregational 
schools; it sets forth the cardinal feature of these schools which was
-P-A-G-E-453
  LUTHERAN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 399 
emphasized in the definition of Prof. Lindemann; and there is in this 
pamphlet a fine apologetic spirit, which reveals the determination of 
Lutherans to repel an attack upon their congregational schools by 
raising the charge that they are an un-American and unpatriotic 
institution. The pamphlet says: 
Many people, misunderstanding the policy of the Lutherans in this direction, 
consider it an unnecessary expenditure of money. They notice that the Luther- 
ans, too, are annually paying high taxes for the maintenance of the public 
schools, and yet they make little or no use of them, but rather erect their own 
schoolhouses and support their own educators. Why is this? Is it because of 
stubborn opposition and hostility to the public-school system? No. The Luther- 
ans are not enemies of the public school; no American citizen can be an enemy 
of the common schools. They are a necessity. Without them our Republic 
would be in great danger of losing its capability for self-government, and the 
lapse into ignorance and barbarism would be only a question of time. The 
public schools are an important factor for good, rendering splendid assistance 
toward the perpetuation of our governmental institutions, the advancement of 
national life, and the progress of society. 
Or is it perhaps the propagation of the German language that accounts for 
the existence of these schools? Not exactly; the study of German is, however, 
emphasized, because this language up to the present time affords the best 
medium in order to reach the Lutherans, who are largely German, in a religious 
way. There is indeed a far weightier reason that induces Lutherans to support 
their own schools. The parochial school system is based on the principle that 
religion is the most important object of human interest and concern. And true 
religion has a special application to children. They are endowed with immortal 
souls and created for eternity. It is of the highest importance, therefore, that 
they be given a thorough and complete religious training. Children with im- 
mortal souls must not be educated for this world only, but especially and prin- 
cipally for eternity. In view of this, they must be daily and diligently instructed 
in the saving truths of Christianity. That is the foremost aim of the Lutheran 
parish schools. In these schools the fear of God, which is the beginning of 
wisdom, is daily imparted to the children. The Lutherans believe that every 
education making any claim to completeness must include religious training; 
that education without religion is like a ship without a compass. A mere moral 
training will not suffice them. Moral education, dealing with the theories of 
right and wrong, considers personal conduct in its effects upon the welfare of 
self and others, whether good or evil. But moral teaching, apart from religion, 
is like a tree separated from its roots. The moral education, therefore, must be 
founded on and issue out of a religious training, because the latter supplies the 
only real basis for true morality. Religious instruction is the only safe and 
solid foundation of an education, because it trains the child to know when its 
behavior is beneficial or harmful to himself and his neighbor. The public 
schools do not and can not offer a religious education. Indeed, they must be 
kept from all religious influence and be entirely independent of it. The Goy- 
- ernment of our country should do all in its power to inculcate and promote a 
high standard of civic righteousness, but the subject of Christian righteousness 
is clearly outside of its sphere and beyond its ability. Because of the peculiar 
religious complexion of our people, the State can not be commissioned with the 
religious instruction of our youth. As loyal citizens of our country we must keep 
church and state distinctly separate. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to the Dan- 
bury Baptist Association, wrote: “ Believing with you that religion is a matter   
-P-A-G-E-454
  400 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
which lies solely between man and his God; that he owes account to none 
other for his faith or his worship; that the legislative powers of government 
reach actions only, not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act 
of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make 
no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between church and state.” The 
principle of American democracy as here declared guarantees all its citizens 
religious liberty and the separation of church and state. Since it is impossible 
to bring any kind of religious training into our public schools under a com- 
mon head (because of the peculiar religious characteristics of the various church 
denominations), it is the solemn duty of the home and the church to provide 
for the religious training necessary for our youth. This, then, is the true situa- 
tion: The public-school system must not meddle with religion in any form. It 
is the exclusive duty of the church to teach religion. This conviction has im- 
pelled Lutherans to establish their own school system and support it with their 
own money, without any financial support of the State. The Lutherans believe 
and know that if they succeed in making their children true citizens of the 
kingdom of Christ, they will at the same time have made them good citizens of 
the United States. Daniel Webster said in his famous Plymouth oration: 
“Whatever makes men good Christians makes them also good citizens.” Glad- 
stone often said: ‘Try to make good, conscientious Christians out of your chil- 
dren, and Great Britain will be well satisfied with them as citizens.” Patrick 
Henry said in his last will and testament: “I have now disposed of all my 
worldly property to my family. There is one more thing I wish I could give 
them, and that is the Christian religion. If they had this and I had not given 
them a shilling, they would be rich; but if they have not the Christian religion 
and I had given them all the world, they would be poor.” Lutherans want their 
children to live happily in Christian homes, to be and remain faithful members 
of their church, and to be the best American citizens, who can be trusted in 
every walk of life because they fear and love God. The Lutheran schools are 
therefore not a menace but a blessing to the liberty of our country. 
The Lutheran congregational schools, as defined by Prof. Linde- 
mann, are religious day schools conducted on the five customary school 
days of the week. The majority of the Lutheran congregational 
schools now in operation in the United States are conducted as regu- 
lar day schools; but in mission parishes, sometimes embracing many 
miles of territory and thinly populated, or in congregations which 
for one reason or another have never installed a parochial school in 
their church work, the children of a congregation may be taught on 
four, three, two, or even one day of the week only, in the last case 
usually on Saturday. There are even schools of this kind to which 
the children come only for certain hours each week, and for the pur- 
pose of receiving religious instruction only, or this and instruction in 
reading and writing the mothér tongue of their parents. It is neces- 
sary to note this fact, because these schools, though few in number 
compared with the rest, are still regarded as congregational schools, 
distinct from the Sunday school, and are numbered in the statistical 
tables which the various Lutheran church bodies publish from time 
to time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-455
  LUTHERAN PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 401 
The Lutheran congregational school, wherever it is fully consti- 
tuted in all its branches of study, embraces both secular and religious 
studies. The former class of studies engross the greater portion of the 
schooltime of each day. Religious studies are confined to the first 
hour in the morning. The rest of the day is devoted to the studies 
which are pursued at our public schools, and to the study of the lan- 
guage of the children’s parents, if these are immigrants from foreign 
countries. The larger Lutheran synods publish their own textbooks, 
prepared by their own pedagogues. In arithmetic, geography, and 
United States history the textbooks in use in the public schools of the 
States have been adopted in many instances. Many of the pupils 
of Lutheran congregational schools, after completing their courses 
at these schools, enter the eighth grade of the public grammar schools, 
or even the high schools. 
The teachers at Lutheran congregational schools are mostly males, 
though nearly 500 females are employed as teachers. With few ex- 
ceptions the teachers are college-bred men, or have had a special 
course of training at a normal school or teachers’ seminary. At the 
beginning of 1913 the following schools which train teachers for 
congregational schools were reported in operation: Evangelical Luth- 
eran Normal School, at Woodville, Ohio (Ohio Synod), with 5 teach- 
ers and 65 students; Evangelical Lutheran Teachers’ Seminary, at 
Addison, Til., now at River Forest, Ill. (operated by the Missouri 
Synod), with 10 teachers and 172 students; Immanuel Lutheran 
Normal, at Greensboro, N. C. (colored; operated by the Synodical 
Conference), with 3 teachers and 8 students; Lutheran Normal 
School, at Sioux Falls, S. Dak. (Norwegian Synod), with 9 teachers 
and 203 students; Lutheran Normal School, at Madison, Minn. 
(United Norwegian Church), with 7 teachers and 150 students; 
Lutheran Teachers’ Seminary, at Seward, Nebr. (Missouri Synod), 
with 8 teachers and 123 students; Wartburg Teachers’ Seminary, at 
Waverly, Iowa (Iowa Synod), with 7 teachers and 117 students. 
There are, however, many students preparing for parochial school 
work at the many Lutheran colleges, academies, and theological semi- 
naries of the country. 
In small and poor congregations the pastor often assumes charge 
  of the school if he can arrange his other work in the parish so as to . 
permit him to do so. There are probably 2,000 Lutheran pastors in 
our country engaged in congregational school work. But the aim of 
Lutheran congregations that have become firmly wedded to the prin- 
ciples outlined before is to obtain a special teacher for their children, 
though the teacher is frequently aided in his work by the pastor. 
Larger congregations grade their schools and appoint two, three, 
four, and even as many as eight teachers.

  402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The school buildings are governed by the same natural laws that 
govern the appointment of teachers. There are instances in which 
the church building serves also as a school. As a rule, however, there 
is a separate school building, and some of the Lutheran congrega- 
tional schools of the country are well-appointed modern structures, 
affording every convenience found in the best schools of the land. 
St. Paul Lutheran congregation of Fort Wayne has a school under 
construction now which will cost about $75,000. 
It remains now to exhibit the progress and condition of the 
Lutheran congregational school statistically. The figures available 
for this purpose are deficient in a few cases, and we have refrained 
from substituting an arbitrary figure gained by estimating the prob- 
able progress or condition. From all the larger bodies statistics are 
at hand up to, and in one case inclusive of, the year 1912. The figures 
for 1913 will not be published until March, 1914, and later. A few 
of the smaller synods have not since 1911 published in accessible form 
the statistics of their school work. 
Beginning with the poorest showing, there are still portions of the 
Lutheran Church of our country where the congregational school is 
unknown or of rare occurrence. The United Synod in the South, a 
federation of smaller Lutheran synods that was effected in 1886, 
did not report any parochial schools at the beginning of the present 
year. This body is entirely English and numbers among its con- 
stituent parts some of the oldest Lutheran synods in the country, such 
as the North Carolina synod, founded in 1820; the South Carolina 
synod, founded in 1824; the Virginia synod, founded in 1829; the 
synod of southwest Virginia, founded in 1842; the Mississippi synod, 
founded in 1855; the Georgia synod, founded in 1860; and the Hol- 
ston synod (operating in eastern Tennessee), founded in 1861. The 
official names of these synods sufficiently indicate the territories to 
which their labors are confined. They are the Southeastern States, 
south of Pennsylvania and Maryland and east of the Mississippi 
River. The synods above named reported at the beginning of the 
current year a baptized membership of 69,196 souls and a confirmed 
or communicant membership of 50,354 persons above the age of 15 
years. 
In another large federation of synods, the General Synod, founded 
in 1820, the parochial school is likewise an almost unknown insti- 
tution. Only the German Wartburg Synod, founded in 1876, and 
affiliated with this body, reports 30 parochial schools, with 500 pupils 
and only 2 teachers. It is not stated how many pastors serve as 
teachers. The General Synod is overwhelmingly English. It has 
its strongest representation in the Eastern and Central States, but 
extends its operations into the Western States, even as far as the 
Pacific coast. It embraces, besides the one synod already named,
-P-A-G-E-457

the Maryland synod, founded in 1820; the West Pennsylvania synod, 
founded in 1825; the East Ohio synod, founded in 1836; the Alle- 
gheny synod and the East Pennsylvania synods, both founded in 
1842; the Miami synod, founded in 1844; the Pittsburgh synod, 
founded in 1845; the Wittenberg syned, founded in 1847; the Olive 
Branch synod, founded in 1848; the Northern Llinois synod, founded 
in 1850; the Central Pennsylvania synod, founded in 1853; the Iowa 
synod and the Northern Indiana synod, both founded in 1855; the 
Central Illinois and the Susquehanna synods, both founded in 1867; 
the Kansas synod, founded in 1868; the Nebraska synod, founded in 
1873; the California synod, the Rocky Mountain synod, and the 
Nebraska German synod, all founded in 1891; the Southern Illinois 
synod, founded in 1901, and the New York synod, the latest addition 
since 1908. There is, then, a large contingent of Lutherans, with 
representation in a majority of the States in the Union, that does 
not conduct congregational schools. This body reported at the 
beginning of 1913 a baptized membership of 405,939 and a communi- 
cant membership of 307,679. 
The third large federation of Lutheran synods, the General Coun- 
cil, founded in 1867, was at the beginning of the current year com- 
posed of 13 synods. Of these, 6 reported no parochial schools, viz, 
the Pittsburgh synod, founded in 1843; the District synod of Ohio, 
founded in 1857; the Chicago synod, founded in 1871; the English 
synod of the northwest, founded in 1891; and the Nova Scotia synod, 
founded in 1903. The last-named synod, and the Central Canada 
synod, founded in 1909, operate outside the United States. Theseven 
synods in this body which reported congregational schools were: 
The Ministerium of Pennsylvania, the oldest Lutheran body in the 
United States, founded in 1748, which reported 36 schools, with 75 
teachers and 2,170 pupils; the Ministerium of New York, the second 
oldest Lutheran society in the Union, founded in 1773, which re- 
ported 84 schools, with 45 teachers and 3,471 pupils; the Swedish 
Augustana synod, founded in 1860, which is credited with 444 schools, 
594 teachers, and 18,602 pupils; the Pacific synod, founded in 1901, 
reporting 2 schools, 2 teachers, and 35 pupils; and the synod of New 
York and New England, founded in 1902, which reports 3 schools, 
19 teachers, and 143 pupils. Two synods reporting parochial schools 
and affiliated with this body operate outside the United States, 
namely, the Lutheran synod of Canada, founded in 1861, with 34 
schools, 21 teachers, and 954 pupils, and the Manitoba synod, founded 
in 1897, with 20 schools and 781 teachers. The General Council is 
largely an English body, operating in the Eastern, Northern, and 
Northwestern States, and in the Canadian Provinces. The larger 
representation, proportionately, of the parochial school in this body 
is due partly to the Swedes and partly to the fact that the two
-P-A-G-E-458

oldest synods have maintained parochial schools probably from the 
time that those synods were organized. The sum total of congre- 
gational schools in the General Council at the beginning of the eur- 
rent year was 623, with 756 teachers and 26,136 pupils. Deducting 
the schools located outside of the United States we obtain for this 
body 579 schools, 735 teachers, and 24,421 pupils. The baptized 
membership of this body at the same date was 751,373, and the com- 
municant membership 495,468. 
There are in the United States 14 independent Lutheran synods— 
i. e., synods which are not federated with any of the general bodies 
already named and yet to be named. Two of these report no par- 
echial schools, viz, the Norwegian synod, founded in 1853, and the 
Icelandic synod, founded in 1885, As regards the former.of these 
it is known to the writer that, notwithstanding the negative report, it 
zealously fosters the congregational school, and even conducts a 
seminary for the training of parochial school-teachers. The baptized - 
membership of this body at the beginning of the current year was 
154,017, and the communicant membership 94,751. It is estimated by 
others that there are in this synod nearly 200 parochial schools. This 
synod is represented in nearly all parts of the United States from 
New York to California and from Minnesota to Texas. This synod 
also carries on work in the northwestern Provinces of Canada. The 
Icelandic synod is represented in the United States only in the States 
of North Dakota and Minnesota. Its work is done chiefly in the 
Canadian Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Its 
baptized membership is 5,112, and its communicant membership 
3,454, 
Of the remaining 12 independent Lutheran synods the Ohio synod, 
founded in 1818, and operating in most of the States of the Union 
and in Canada and Australia, is credited with 265 schools, 116 
teachers, and 9,354 pupils. This synod numbers 191,460 baptized or 
131,923 communicant members. 
The Buffalo synod, founded in 1845, and consisting of a small num- 
ber of isolated congregations in New York, Michigan, Ohio, and 
Canada, reports 20 schools and 7 teachers. The baptized membership 
of this body is 8,600, the communicant membership 5,200. 
The Norwegian Eielson synod, founded in 1846, and consisting of 
only six congregations in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and North 
Dakota, reports 6 schools and 4 teachers. This synod numbers 1,500 
baptized or 1,100 communicant members. 
Hauge’s Norwegian synod, founded. in 1846, and operating in 11 
Central States, reports 181 parochial schools, and 6,000 pupils. Its 
membership is given at 50,000 baptized, or 36,200 communicant 
members.

Texas, reports 12 schools, 12 teachers, and 250 pupils. It numbers 
6,000 baptized or 4,500 communicant members. 
The German Towa synod, founded in 1854, has most of its con- 
gregations in 14 Central, 3 Western States, and a few in Canada. It 
is credited with 731 parochial schools, 36 teachers, and 11,910 pupils. 
Its baptized membership iS 183,121, its communicant membership

The Danish Lutheran Church, a synod founded in 1871 and having 
a scattered membership all over the United States, reports 84 schools, | 
96 teachers, and 2,498 pupils. Its membership is 20,519 baptized and | 
13,098 communicant members. . 
The German Immanuel Synod, founded in 1886 and operating in 
the Eastern and Middle States, is credited with 7 schools, 7 teachers, 
and 160 pupils. It numbers 5,027 baptized, or 3,390 communiecant 
members, 
The Finnish Suomi Synod, founded in 1890, is represented in 
Michigan, Minnesota, Massachusetts, [linois, Ohio, and Pennsyl- 
vania. It reports 47 schools, 52 teachers, 2,537 pupils, and has a mem- 
bership of 27,460 baptized, or 13,660 communicant members. | 
The United Norwegian Church, a synod founded in 1890 and oper- | 
ating in the United States and in western Canada, reports 1,000 2 
schools, 987 teachers, and 50,584 pupils. Its membership is 275,970 
baptized and 169,710 communicant members. 
The United Danish Church, founded in 1896 and represented in 
the United States and Canada, reports 111 schools and 5,000 pupils. 
Its membership is 19,610 baptized and 10,823 communicant members. 
The Norwegian Lutheran Free Church, founded in 1897 and oper- | 
ating in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michi- 
gan, Illinois, Iowa, Washington, Oregon, and Canada, reports 118 
schools, 210 teachers, and 9,575 pupils, with a membership of 39,000 
baptized and 18,500 communicant members. 
In all these independent synods the sum total of congregational 
schools, inclusive of any located in Canada, is 2,644, of teachers 1,524, 
and of pupils 97,868. 
Ninety Lutheran pastors in the United States, who are without 
synodical connection and serve approximately 205 congregations with 
a baptized membership of 50,000, or a communicant membership of | 
27,500, report no parochial schools. 
The best showing for parochial schools is made by a federation of 
synods overwhelmingly German, which bears the official name of the ! 
Synodical Conference of North America. It was founded in 1872 | 
and consists of six synods. Excepting the larger bodies among the |

independent synods named above, the Lutheran parochial school may 
be said to be in the most flourishing condition in the Synodical Con- 
ference. Here, too, more elaborate statistics are available than else- 
where. 
The Missouri synod, founded in 1847 and represented in nearly 
every State of the Union, in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, reports 
2,216 schools, with a teaching force of 11,069 male and 252 female 
teachers and 1,166 pastors teaching in these schools. The number of 
pupils was 94,167, in a baptized membership of 934,199, and a com- 
municant membership of 565,129. 
The Wisconsin synod, founded in 1850, and operating in Wis- 
consin, Michigan, Washington, Illinois, and Alabama, reports 290 
schools, 118 teachers, and 32,825 pupils. It numbers 185,311 bap- 
tized and 165,821 communicant members. 
The Minnesota synod, founded in 1860, and represented in Minne- 
sota, North and South Dakota, and Wisconsin, reports 155 schools, 
26 teachers, and 15,940 pupils, in a baptized membership of 92,185, 
and a communicant membership of 46,213. 
The District Synod of Michigan, founded in 1895, and represented 
in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, reports 75 schools, 7 teachers, and 
2,933 pupils. It numbers 21,224 baptized and 15,211 communicant 
members. 
The District Synod of Nebraska, founded in 1904, and represented 
in Nebraska and South Dakota, reports 25 schools, 4 teachers, and 
995 pupils. Its baptized membership is 17,202, and its communicant 
membership 10,978. 
The Lutheran Slovak synod, founded in 1902, and represented in 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
and Wisconsin, reports 25 schools and 1,530 pupils in a baptized 
membership of 19,275 and a communicant membership of 13,631. 
For the entire Synodical Conference the sum total of schools is 
2,786; of teachers, 1,476; of pupils, 148,390. 
The grand total for the Lutheran Church in the United States is 
5,883 schools, 3,758 teachers, and 272,914 pupils. The baptized 
membership of the Lutheran Church in the United States is given at 
8,533,410, and the communicant membership at 2,317,177. Deduct- 
ing the communicant from the baptized membership we obtain 
1,216,023, which is approximately the number of Lutheran children 
from infancy to the age of 14 or 15, when they leave the congrega- 
tional school. Accordingly, the 272,914 pupils of the Lutheran con- 
gregational school represent 22.44 per cent of the child population 
of the Lutheran Church; or, in other words, out of 100 Lutheran 
children, 22 attend a parochial school, or for every 22 children that 
go to school there are 78, including infants and children up to the 
age of 6, that do not go to a parochial school.

CHAPTER XVIII. 
THE SCHOOLS OF THE MORMON CHURCH. 
By Osgorne J. P. Wiprsor, 
Principal of Latter-Day Saints High School, Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Contents.—-Early history—Administration and revenues—School buildings and fur- 
niture—Grades of schools—Attendance—Teachers.   
EARLY HISTORY. 
The school system of the Mormon Church began with the establish- 
ment of the church at Fayette, N. Y., on the 6th day of April, 1830. 
Among the earliest utterances of the founder, Joseph Smith, were 
declarations that the glory of God is intelligence; that men can not 
be saved in ignorance; that a man can be saved no faster than he 
gains knowledge; and that “whatever principles of intelligence we 
attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection; and 
if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through 
his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the 
advantage in the world to come.” In June, 1831, a committee was 
appointed to select and to prepare textbooks for use in church schools. 
A so-called “elders” school was organized in 1832. In 1833, 1834, 
and 1835 Mormon schools were maintained at Kirtland, Ohio, and at 
Independence, Mo. Besides, there are mentioned in the early history 
of the Mormon Church a Hebrew school, a singing school, and the 
School of the Prophets. On December 16, 1840, the Mormon leader 
with his followers, then located in the remodeled and rechristened 
town of Nauvoo, on the banks of the Mississippi, was granted a 
charter to “establish and organize an institution of learning within 
the limits of the city [of Nauvoo] for the teaching of the arts, sciences, 
and learned professions, to be called the University of the City of 
Nauvoo.” Unfortunately, however, there remains little reliable in- 
formation concerning these early ventures in the field of education. 
What may be termed the second period in the history of education 
in the Mormon Church begins with the settlement of the Mormon 
pioneers in the Territory of Utah, and led to the establishment of the 
public-school system. The pioneers entered the valley of the Great 
Salt Lake July 22, 1847. The first school in Utah was opened only 
three months later, in October, 1847. The first schoolhouse in Utah 
consisted of an old military tent, “shaped,” we are told, “like an 
409
-P-A-G-E-464
  
  410 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
ordinary Indian wigwam.” The first school-teacher in Utah was 
Mary Jane Dilworth, a worthy Quakeress who had joined the Mor- 
mon Church early in the forties. Miss Dilworth conducted a school 
for the smaller children. When the rigorous winter weather stopped 
the outdoor work of the men, Julian Moses opened a school for the 
older children. Before Christmas time of the pioneer year there were 
thus two schools in active operation in the newly founded Great Salt 
Lake City. On November 27, 1850, three years after the Mormon 
pioneers had settled in Utah, the Deseret Evening News contained 
the following correspondence: 
Common schools were beginning in all parts of the city for the winter; and 
plans for the construction of schoolhouses in every ward were being made, with 
a view for a general system of schoolhouses throughout the city. One plan had 
already been submitted, which comprised three large schoolrooms, a large hall 
for lecturing, a private study, reading room, and library. 
In the same year (1850) was founded in Salt Lake City the first 
university west of the Missouri River, the University of Deseret, now 
the University of Utah. It is needless to follow further this period 
of Mormon education. The early population of Utah was wholly 
Mormon; these early schools were founded by the Mormons in their 
desire for knowledge and were maintained by them. In time, how- 
ever, the many schools, elementary and advanced, that followed the 
humble beginning made by Miss Dilworth were officially recognized 
by the Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Utah, and have since 
grown into the very efficient public-school system of the State of 
Utah. 
The third period in the history of education in the Mormon Church 
has evolved the system of schools now in operation in the church. 
This system includes schools conducted in the United States of 
America, in Canada, in Mexico, in New Zealand, on the Pacific 
islands, and in various missions of the church throughout the world. 
It will be proper, however, to mention briefly here only those con- 
ducted in the United States of America. On October 16, 1875, 25 
years after the incorporation of the University of Deseret, President 
Brigham Young founded in Provo, Utah, the Brigham Young 
Academy. Two years later he established in Logan, Utah, the Brig- 
ham Young College. Both of these schools grew out of President 
Young’s conviction that the day school should teach the heart and 
the hand, as well as the head. Religion had been excluded from the 
curricula of the public schools. The instruction then given in the 
schools was mainly theoretical. There seemed to be need, therefore, 
for a new system of schools in which religious and industrial train- 
ing might be given. The deeds of trust to these schools provided that 
“students who take a full course shall be taught, if their physical 
ability will permit, some branch of mechanism that shall be suitable
-P-A-G-E-465
  THE SCHOOLS OF THE MORMON CHURCH. 411, 
  to their taste and capacity.” This was the beginning of industrial | 
education in Utah. It was further declared that it should be the, 
purpose of the church schools to— 
make of the students and graduates worthy citizens and true followers of Jesus | 
Christ, by fitting them for some useful pursuit, by strengthening in their minds 
a pure attachment to the Constitution of the United States, and to our repub- 
lican institutions by teaching them the lessons of purity, morality, and upright , 
conduct. 
The church schools at Provo and Logan proved of such great worth 
to the people that during the next 10 to 20 years a system of schools 
developed. Academies, or high schools, were established in the 
larger and more populous divisions of the church, and seminaries, 
or elementary schools, in the larger and wealthier wards. By 1890 
the church schools had become so numerous and the school work so 
extensive that Dr. Karl G. Maeser, who had been principal of the 
Brigham Young Academy since its establishment, was appointed 
general superintendent of church schools. Under his direction and 
supervision the church schools grew in importance and efficiency. 
ADMINISTRATION AND REVENUES. 
For the advancement of its educational interests, the Mormon 
Church has developed a splendidly organized system. First, to super- 
intend and control the educational policy of the church there is a 
general church board of education. The authority of this board 
extends in matters educational throughout the entire church. Sec- 
ondly, as the immediate agent of the general board and supervisor of 
the schools there is a general superintendent. Thirdly, to consider 
all matters pertaining to courses of study and to certification of 
teachers there is a board of examiners consisting of the general super- 
intendent and the principals of the largest three schools. Finally, . 
each school has its own board of trustees to supervise all matters 
purely local. ' 
The revenues of the church school system are derived almost wholly 
from the tithes voluntarily paid by the members of the church. Dur- 
ing the school year 1911-12 the Mormon Church expended for the 
maintenance of its American schools alone $405,180. For 1912-13 
the expenditure amounted to $410,634. 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND FURNITURE. 
The Mormon Church maintains in the United States of America 
20 schools of secondary and college grade. Each one of these schools 
has an educational plant and equipment fully adequate to care for 
the community in which it is located. In some cases the school 
buildings have cost upward of $100,000 each. The financial report 
for 1911-12 shows that in that year the value of American school
-P-A-G-E-466
  412 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
} 
buildings and real estate owned by the church was $1,512,589, while 
the value of furniture was $176,432. For 1912-13 the land and build- 
ing value is $1,525,579, while the furniture value is $205,992. 
GRADES OF SCHOOLS, 
' The seminaries, or elementary schools, begun in the late seventies 
and the eighties, were discontinued after a few years. This was 
for two reasons. First, it was found to be too expensive an under- 
taking to educate the great number of children of elementary school 
age. Secondly, the public schools had themselves been very much 
improved, and, moreover, they had been made free. In the United 
States, therefore, the Mormon Church concluded to maintain schools 
of secondary and higher grade only. There is at present a school 
located at Provo, Utah, the Church Teachers’ College of the Brig- 
ham Young University. The Brigham Young University gives 
also a two-year normal course, open to high-school graduates, 
to prepare teachers for elementary schools. Two other church 
schools, the Brigham Young College, at Logan, and the Snow Acad- 
emy at Ephraim, Utah, offer the same two-year normal course. The 
other church schools in the United States offer only the standard 
high-school courses. 
ATTENDANCE. 
The total attendance for the year 1912-13 in the church schools lo- 
cated in the United States was 6,292. Of this number 3,423 were 
males; 2,869 females, All but 301 were of high-school grade. Boys 
to the number of 1,314 and girls numbering 1,835 were pursuing 
industrial courses. At the end of the year there were 600 graduates 
from standard high-school courses. 
TEACHERS. 
Tt has been found to be true in the church schools, as in the public 
schools, that buildings and equipment are of less importance than 
the character and qualifications of the teacher. Recently, therefore, 
the standards required of teachers have been considerably raised. 
In the first place, every teacher in a church school must give satis- 
factory evidence of high moral character and of faithful activity in 
the church. In the second place, every teacher must meet the re- 
quirements of scholarship prescribed by the law of the State in which 
he is teaching. In this way there has been assembled in the Mormon 
Church schools a corps of teachers unexcelled in integrity and in 
scholarly accomplishments. The total number of teachers is 309— 
males, ; females, 87.

CHAPTER XIX. 
THE METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH-TEACHING IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
By Fietcuer B. Dresstar, 
Special Agent of the Bureau of Education, Peabody College for Teachers. 
ConrENts.—Origin and purpose of this chapter—Methods of health instruction—Federal health 
service—State boards of health—City health departments—Schools and colleges—The campaign 
against tuberculosis— Cleanliness — Sex hygiene— School hygiene—Mouth hygiene—Hygiene of 
infancy—Health teaching through nurses—Rural sanitation—Hookworm disease. 
ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER. 
In reply to a general request sent out about the middle of August 
by the Commissioner of Education a splendid amount of material in 
both printed and typewritten form was received from the various 
voluntary societies and organizations which are engaged throughout 
the country in general health propaganda. In his request for infor- 
mation the Commissioner stated that the material was desired for a 
chapter on health teaching in his Annual Report. When the material 
was gathered, digested, and organized it was found that there was a 
great deal more of it than could be included within the bounds of an 
ordinary chapter. It was decided, therefore, that instead of detract- 
ing from this material by reducing it to the limits of a chapter, it 
should be published separately, and that a general analysis of the 
methods employed and the topics presented should be prepared for 
this Report. This statement seems desirable to reassure those who 
kindly gave their time and service to preparing special reports and to 
sending material. Therefore it seems only fair to say to those who 
read this review that a completer and fuller account of the health- 
teaching work of the societies reporting will be found in a bulletin 
which will be published by the bureau for distribution at an early 
date. 
The main purpose of this chapter, therefore, will be to set forth in 
a general way the methods and means employed by these societies 
and organizations to educate the people along the specific lines for 
which each was organized. For example, the various societies 
organized for the purpose of helping to rid the country of tuberculosis 
415
-P-A-G-E-470
  416 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
have naturally developed their plans and prepared their campaigns 
for this specific purpose. Those which have given their chief atten- 
tion to the dangers threatening from venereal diseases have gathered 
information and prepared material to educate the people in matters 
of sex hygiene. Likewise societies for the prevention of blindness 
have devoted their energies to teaching mothers and nurses the 
proper care and treatment of the newborn, as well as the dangers due 
to contagious troubles, such as trachoma and other diseases affecting 
the eyes. 
METHODS OF HEALTH INSTRUCTION. 
The most universally used means of spreading the gospel of good 
health to the general public has been the preparation, publication, 
and distribution of printed matter setting forth in a clear and simple 
way the facts to be promulgated. This printed matter has appeared 
in many forms, but in general it may be classified as follows: 
Books.—Many books have appeared undertaking to set forth health 
requirements in a popular form. For the most part these have been 
written on special topics, and as most of them are on the market 
nothing further need be said here, save to say they cover such topics 
as medical inspection, sex hygiene, open-air schools and camps, con- 
servation of health, rural sanitation, municipal sanitation, tubercu- 
losis, disinfection, national vitality, mouth hygiene, home hygiene, 
school hygiene, infectious diseases, the care of children, etc. The 
interesting feature about these books from our point of view is the 
fact that a great number have been written not for physicians or 
health specialists, but for the general public. Hence, in most of them 
a simple and interesting style has been used. Their authors have 
undertaken to state the results of scientific work without the use of 
technical language, and more especially they have undertaken to 
outline some constructive policy or to detail some line of procedure 
which looks toward the preservation of health and the eradication 
of disease. So far as I know, with the exception of cyclopedias, text- 
books, and books on agriculture, these new books on various topics 
of health work are the most successful attempts to popularize scien- 
tific knowledge. 
Bulletins and pamphlets —-By far the greater amount of the pub- 
lished material has come out in the form of bulletins or tracts for 
free distribution. Some of these are models of popular writing, but 
some of them have exhibited somewhat crude methods of didactics. 
For example, many use the ‘‘don’t” method. That is to say, they 
have tried to protect people by telling them what they should not 
do. Without doubt there will always be need of warning people of 
danger; but all who have learned to teach most successfully know 
that far more effective training and much more purposeful education

  METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING. 417 
will come through a positive statement of facts and reasons than 
through the mere negation of action. Most people know by expe- 
rience that a temptation to do a thing often develops because they 
have been forbidden without knowing reasons for such interdiction. 
The psychology of this form of disobedience deserves the attention 
of those who prepare these publications. These bulletins have, as a 
usual thing, been written to meet special conditions, and hence treat 
either a single topic or afew related topics. Each society or organiza- 
tion has published matter relating to its special line of work, and 
thus in the total a very wide range of health topics has been empha- 
sized. When these are brought together, they make a considerable 
literature on health teaching. Many of the publications are illus- 
trated with suggestive cuts and graphic representation of facts, and 
figures so as to impress the memory most forcibly. In general, there 
is a commendable degree of conservatism shown by the writers of 
these pamphlets; but sometimes enthusiasm outruns the facts, and 
overstatements result. Some writers need to learn the lesson that 
the safest and wisest method of teaching is to evaluate a fact for its 
exact worth and to remember that in the long run an overstatement 
is always an untruth. Enthusiasm and earnestness are necessary ele- 
ments in all successful teaching, but honesty and fairness are still 
more important. If unquestioned faith on the part of the people is 
desired, scrupulous honesty, as well as authenticated facts, must be 
used in teaching them. The almost universal habit of a specialist 
in any line of work is to look upon his special field as the most impor- 
tant within the range of human knowledge; hence he is prone to 
overstate the value of the facts with which he deals, and therefore 
to mislead the common mind for whose sake in the long run the work 
was done. Absolute and persistent loyalty to a cause depends on 
an unshaken faith, and in the final analysis this faith must be built 
on the solid foundations of truth. One can frighten people into a 
temporary belief, but he can not terrify them into a real education. 
These principles apply to popular education with more validity than 
to scientific workers. 
Lectures.—Throughout this whole spontaneous campaigning for 
good health, the lecture method has been a dominant factor. With 
scarcely an exception all the societies engaged in any way with health 
teaching have depended on public lectures and ‘‘talks” to start the 
work and kindle enthusiasm. The appeal of the human voice and 
the direct contact of spirit with spirit in popular teaching is still the 
most potent ‘authority over the popular audience. However, the 
illustrated lecture and the motion-picture method are gradually being 
more and more introduced. When an audience can see the house 
fly deposit its eggs in a mass of rubbish, the maggots emerge, and 
17726°—rp 1913—voi 1——27
-P-A-G-E-472
  418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the whole chain of developments, from the egg to the full-grown fly, 
take place within a minute or two, a tremendous impression is made, 
and much time is saved. Mere talk about germs makes a far greater 
demand on the credulity of an audience than is made when they see 
these things highly magnified and projected upon a screen. With 
the masses, seeing makes for immediate belief. Hence, greater and 
greater use is made of the stereopticon and the moving-picture film. 
Iam sure that this method holds in store for us much greater things, 
for we are just entering on an era of greater scientific use of this won- 
derful adaptation of the microscope to photography. By and by 
chemical reactions and physiological functions will be rendered visible, 
and the dangers to life will stalk in the fields of clear vision. 
Newspaper work in health propaganda.—The press of the country 
has been exceedingly liberal during the year in publishing general 
articles on various phases of public health and reporting the work 
of the numerous societies which have devoted their time and atten- 
tion to this work. The ‘“news-letter” is a comparatively modern 
method of getting before the public all kinds of information. Many 
of the National and State societies have prepared great numbers 
of special articles on different phases of public health, have dupli- 
cated these, and have sent them broadcast to the newspapers. By 
reason of the fact that they are written in a popular style and contain. 
useful information that makes good reading, the press of the coun- 
try has been not only willing, but glad, to publish them. Some 
societies have reported that they have thus put before the people 
through hundreds of newspapers a great many articles designed 
to teach the people how to develop their health as well as to prevent 
illness. Thus country newspapers have been furnished acceptable 
copy without expense, and multitudes of people have had a chance 
‘to learn many valuable lessons. The popular magazines have also 
done a large share of educational work by presenting to their readers 
much important matter relative to public health and hygiene. The 
extension of the rural mail delivery has greatly aided in scattering 
this material to all parts of the country. 
Exhibitions.—Of recent years exhibitions have increased at a very 
rapid rate until scarcely a city or school has not held, sometime during 
the year, a series of exhibitions illustrative of the various phases of 
educational work. In these. exhibitions the attempt is made to 
present in an instructive form the facts and conditions of the subject 
toward which the public mind is directed. The various organiza- 
tions which have undertaken health work have not been slow to take 
advantage of this method of popular education. Perhaps it is not 
far from the truth to say that we are yet in a somewhat crude stage 
of development with reference to our exhibition work. Just as in 
all methods of procedure, a new movement is usually at the mercy
-P-A-G-E-473
  METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING, 419 
of enthusiasts who are not always in a proper spirit to distinguish 
clearly between the value of truth and the value of the unusual. 
It is exceedingly difficult to prepare material for a popular exhibition 
and at the same time to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
At best only isolated groups of facts can be presented, and often they 
are so dissociated from their true setting that they give an erroneous 
perspective. In addition to various forms of graphic illustrations, 
photographs, and many kinds of charts, the tendency is more toward 
introducing models illustrating better methods of procedure rather 
than calling attention to the conditions that now exist. In America 
competent model-makers are comparatively scarce and especially 
those who are at the same time capable of appreciating the value of 
truthful representation. The period of model-making with us is 
just beginning and without doubt will become a much more potent 
factor in popular education than it is at present. Many societies 
are calling for aid in preparing exhibitions, and they need guidance 
and help, if this form of educational endeavor is to meet popular 
expectation. I believe it would be a splendid departure for some of 
our higher teacher training schools and universities to make special 
provision to assist the people in arranging local exhibitions and guid- 
ing them so that the impressions gained from such exhibitions will 
be truthful and at the same time cogent and forceful. There is no 
doubt concerning the method of this form of education, but many 
of those who are using it are working more or less blindly, without 
any guiding principles, and are more interested in presenting novel 
material than they are in its comparative value. Universities and 
normal schools that are especially interested in furthering education 
among the masses are losing a splendid opportunity for service by 
neglecting to offer expert help and guidance in this direction. There 
ought to bea professor of popular education in such institutions whose 
business it would be to gather and evaluate material, arrange it, and 
plan to help the people present it in the most effective way. Thou- 
sands of people are daily studying exhibits in the cities and towns 
of our country, and a great opportunity for social service and popular 
education is more or less unintelligently managed and unrelated. 
To be of most use these exhibitions should be closely related to local 
conditions and developed in such a way as to insure active better- 
ment of conditions. Hence, not only the mere facts but constructive 
policies and plans should be outlined or developed into models to 
guide and instruct the people. For example, if country people could 
see an exact duplicate in miniature of a well-ordered and a properly 
constructed sanitary system for rural homes, and in addition could 
have it explained by one who understands from both points of view, 
not only information but guidance in construction would result.
-P-A-G-E-474
  420 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Due to the almost limitless use of electricity in producing striking 
results with automatic devices, another kind of illustrative material 
is more and more largely used. For example, it is a well-known fact 
that those babies who are nursed by their mothers, other things 
equal, are much more liable to live than are those brought up with 
artificial foods. But if 100 lights representing 100 babies on one side 
and the same number on another side are put out at the same rate 
as the death of the babies in each group this fact is more favorably 
brought to the attention of the average onlooker. In a similar way 
a device showing the rate of death from tuberculosis in our country 
will express the truth to the people more quickly and will produce a 
more lasting impression than mere statistics will ever do. 
One who reads the general accounts given by these societies of 
their health work will not fail to see how they are groping in the dark 
for better methods for illustrative teaching and also the dangers of 
possible overstatements and incorrect emphasis. The specialist in 
exhibition material needs also to be a person of scientific acumen and 
sufficient self-control to prevent the subordination of truth to striking 
methods of appeal. 
Clinics—Another mode of appeal has developed through what is 
now popularly known as clinics. This word in its original meaning 
more nearly described instruction given in hospitals at the bedside of 
a patient. The word comes from the Greek «ivy, meaning bed. 
It is now used for any sort of public meeting place where people are 
treated for diseases or defects, or even where people teach mothers 
how to feed children in a scientific manner and to prepare the proper 
sorts of food. Thus many so-called clinics are chiefly voluntary 
schools of a very definite sort to teach the people better methods of 
earing for their health. : 
Congresses and meetings—With the development of rapid transit 
and the habit of traveling, which is perhaps more marked in the 
American people than in any other nation on the globe, an astonish- 
ing number of associational gatherings and meetings are held all over 
the country. A large majority of these introduce into their program 
discussions bearing on topics touching public health. However, a 
great many organizations whose chief purpose is directed to other 
fields of work have indirectly been of service in presenting to popular 
audiences the gospel of good health and the doctrines of public 
hygiene. A large number of meetings of women’s clubs, congresses, 
and conventions, local, State, and National, are held each year. 
Most of these give large space on their programs to matters of public 
health. One is almost tempted to say that such gatherings have 
multiplied almost to the limit of usefulness. Scarcely a profession or 
a trade is without its organization and its annual or semiannual 
gathering. There are associations for teachers, doctors, lawyers,
-P-A-G-E-475
METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING. 421 
tailors, bankers, merchants, manufacturers, barbers, janitors, and 
possibly gravediggers. One can scarcely go through the programs 
prepared for these gatherings without finding something in the 
nature of public health discussion. There are literally hundreds of 
such organizations, and no one can deny to them certain values in this 
all-prevailing health revival. Naturally the doctrines preached vary 
with the point of view, but after all they are on the whole more nearly 
in accord than any other doctrine preached. so generally. 
Those who have arranged the programs for these gatherings have 
been wise enough to ask for the help of those who have given special 
attention to public health and hygiene, and hence, in general, such 
topics have been carefully and wisely presented. Many of the larger 
associations, such as the National Education Association, the Ameri- 
ean Medical Association, the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, 
and others of ranking importance, have special committees whose 
business it is to devote their time and attention to health propaganda. 
The same method of organization has been used in many local and 
State societies, so that in their public meetings attention is given to 
this phase of work. 
FEDERAL HEALTH SERVICE. 
The National Government does its chief educational work along 
the lines of health, through its Public Health Service, the Bureau of 
Edueation, and the Department of Agriculture, though the War 
Department has indirectly done a splendid service in taking the lead 
in sanitary measures especially against yellow fever, malaria, typhoid 
fever, and bubonic plague. The Public Health Service, the Bureau 
of Education, and the Department of Agriculture have served the 
cause of health chiefly through published documents and lectures. 
The scientific investigations of the Public Health Service have also 
been of much direct and indirect service to State boards of health 
and to the cause of preventive medicine in general. The Federal 
Departments are all showing an increased interest in the health move- 
ment as a part of the larger task of national conservation, and it is 
only a question of time, I believe, till a Department of Health, coor- 
dinate with the other Cabinet offices, will be established and work 
in this direction correlated and extended. 
STATE BOARDS OF HEALTH. 
The various States through their State boards or commissions of 
health are rapidly extending their work to include more of preventive 
measures and more direct educational work. They are all engaged 
in publishing some form of bulletin or document which they distribute 
to the people of the State without cost. These bulletins, in addition 
to statistics relating to the various health conditions of the State,
-P-A-G-E-476
  422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
especially regarding contagious diseases, contain much information 
relative to the prevention of the spread of disease and to the general 
problems of sanitation. 
Most of the State boards in the Southern States are closely affili- 
ated with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the eradication 
of the hookworm disease, and more or less directly with the boards 
of education of other States. Some of the States in the North, 
notably Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Wis- 
eonsin, have given their State boards of health larger authority and 
more money for their work. In addition to the ordinary bulletins 
which are issued regularly, most of the State boards of health are 
publishing special brochures on specifie topics such as tuberculosis, 
typhoid fever, diphtheria, the house fly, and many other topics. It 
is notable that these publications have been written for the public, 
rather than for the medical profession. They are in the main 
expressed in untechnical language, are often well illustrated, and are 
serving a splendid purpose. One of the best illustrations of educa- 
tional work in this line is furnished by the State of Indiana. The 
board of health of that State has for a number of years been sending 
out lecturers and exhibits to instruct the people with reference to the 
prevention of disease, especially tuberculosis and typhoid fever. 
This board works through the various local organizations of a com- 
munity, through the public schools, and through health officers, 
studying local conditions, speaking to the people in public mass meet- 
ings, lecturing to children in the public schools and exhibiting to 
them modern methods of sanitation, and preaching the doctrine of 
health preservation. In this way they come into contact with thou- 
sands of people annually and strive to make their duty as quaran- 
tine officers as unnecessary as possible. 
Several health boards, notably those of California and Louisiana, 
have health cars equipped with an exhibition on sanitation. These 
ears are carried all through the State, stopping at towns, villages, 
and cities, showing the people better modes of living, and interesting 
them in the general problems of health. These peripatetic messen- 
gers of health have created a public conscience for cleanliness and 
wholesomeness which perhaps could not have been brought about in 
any other way. They have shown the people how to have sanitary 
water supply, build comfortable sanitary homes, take care of milk, 
care for children, and protect their homes from the dangers of con- 
tagion and infection. 
The health board of Minnesota employed a special agent to visit 
the various towns and villages throughout the State to interest the 
school people and general public in the problems of school hygiene. 
By lack of the necessary appropriation from the legislature, this work 
will not be carried on the coming year.
-P-A-G-E-477
METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING, 423 
Many State boards of health are joining with universities and col- 
leges in delivering series of lectures to students on various problems 
of public health, and in this way dealing with those who will be 
especially influential in the years to come. In the aggregate the 
State boards have in the past year made commendable progress in 
devoting more of their time to the general education of the masses 
concerning the conservation of health and the prevention of diseases 
than they have in any year heretofore. Special attention has been 
given to protecting the people against infected water supply, to 
securing better sanitation in public carriers and public buildings and 
more stringent supervision of the laws regarding vital statistics and 
similar matters. In practically all of the States the machinery now 
exists for making State boards of health far more effective as public 
teachers of health than they have been. What is needed most of all 
is better financial support on the part of the legislatures. The aver- 
age legislator does not fully realize that the preservation of the health 
of the people is one of the best means of investment for financial wel- 
fare as well as moral welfare. Without doubt the future will call for 
more service from all the State boards of health and will demand of 
legislatures better support. ‘ 
If I may dare to suggest where the need is greatest and where the 
help is least frequently given, I would say that State boards of health 
should give more of their time to the country districts. By properly 
cooperating with various county boards of health or local associa- 
tions, voluntary or public, each State ought to be organized into a 
unit, so that wherever there is need, help could be quickly furnished. 
The public schools are vitally concerned in all matters of health 
teaching, and the State boards of health, as well as county and city 
boards of health, can well afford to cooperate with them and bring to 
their help needed information and plans for work. In the main, this 
is the direction in which progress is making, and it argues for more 
effective educational work. 
As an illustration of what may be done to bring health teaching 
more definitely and quickly to rural communities the method used in 
Porto Rico may be cited. 
A specially built wagon is fitted out with moving-picture apparatus, supplied with 
the proper educational films designed to illustrate the dangers of mosquitoes, flies, 
and other pests, and is sent from town to town to give a free moving-picture show, so 
that the masses of the people can see and hear. 
Some of our State boards of health should profit by this suggestion 
and, in cooperation with each county board of health, equip a wagon 
to meet the needs of the county and send it out to all the people and 
interest them in health matters. This would carry the work of the 
health train to the country, where, it seems to me, the need is greatest. 
   
-P-A-G-E-478
  424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, 
I believe it will express very nearly the truth if I say that during 
the past year city health departments have given far more attention 
than ever before to searching out serious sources of infection and 
urging people to take precaution against disease. Of course, there are 
always exceptions. It is generally true, however, that the public 
water supply is more carefully guarded and more frequently tested, 
the public milk supply has been put under stricter rules, and better 
obedience to these rules is demanded. The matter of housing has 
received increased attention, but not as much as it demands. In 
most cities special precaution has been taken with reference to 
ophthalmia neonatorum, exposure to tuberculous patients, public 
drinking fountains, the prevention of dust and smoke, more stringent 
rules against use of unguarded machinery, and general recommenda- 
tions with reference to the use of antityphoid serum; and larger num- 
bers of people than ever before have been reached through public 
lectures and published material. 
A number of the city boards of health have charge of the medical 
examinations of the public-school children, and through this work 
they have come into immediate contact with the whole population. 
The health boards of a few of the larger cities of the country have 
divided their work into various departments, and have in this way 
been able to set aside certain helpers whose business it is to work with 
the people and teach them the care of the health of both children and 
adults. The department of child hygiene of the New York City health 
board is a good illustration of how a city may, through its general 
health department, extend its work to the care of its children. 
In reports presented this year many city boards of health have 
stated that their chief work consists in education of the public in 
matters of preventive medicine and hygiene. This is a new attitude, 
and it is going to be more marked in the future than it is in the pres- 
ent, for it can not be other than sane and sensible to try to anticipate 
difficulties and prevent them, rather than to wait until they overtake 
us and then try to overcome them. 
SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. 
There have been comparatively few marked advances in health 
teaching in the various schools and colleges during the year over 
that of previous years. Probably the most noticeable advances are 
those made by Harvard College in cooperation with the Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology, by the University of Wisconsin, and 
the University of Virginia through its department of education. 
Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have 
in cooperation established a school for health officers, in which courses 
 
-P-A-G-E-479
  
METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING, 425 
are given leading to the degree of doctor of public health. The prin- 
cipal purpose of this school is the preparation of young men for public- 
health work, especially to fit them for administrative positions, as 
officers or members of boards of health, or of various organizations 
looking toward the public welfare. The University of Wisconsin has 
organized a number of its schools and colleges into what is known 
as a “health instruction bureau.’’ This bureau is connected with 
the extension division of the university. It offers help through 
lectures, various publications, expert consultations, and a general 
bureau of information on all matters touching the health of a com- 
munity. The whole purpose of the bureau seems to be to serve the 
people by bringing to them the latest and most helpful knowledge 
pertaining to the health and comfort of the people and to show them 
how to apply this knowledge in practical affairs, 
The University of Virginia, through its professor of education, Dr. 
Heck, has been engaged in a special health campaign in Virginia 
during the past year. Prof. Heck spends four or five days every 
week in the field, and lectures at the university on Saturdays only. 
It is his business to go out among the people, especially to teachers’ 
gatherings, mothers’ clubs, and to all organizations which have a 
special interest in school work, and to spend his time teaching the 
teachers and the pupils in the public schools the doctrines of health 
and sanitation, especially in those things which have to do with 
school life. In this way he has. been able to cover a considerable 
part of the State in a complete way and has not only served to teach 
the people, but he has learned to know the conditions and needs of the 
State better than could possibly have been known in any other way. 
I know of no other university in the country which attempts to do 
the same sort of field work. 
Possibly the most urgent need of better courses of general hygiene 
is shown by the normal schools of the country. Comparatively few 
of them appear to have awakened to the need of teaching rural 
hygiene. By the very nature of their organization they are giving 
their chief time and attention to the preparation of teachers for the 
rural sckools. No more vital knowledge is needed on the part of 
such teachers than that which relates to the welfare of the child in 
school and out of school. So far as I can determine, very little advance 
has been made in the normal schools during the past year in vital- 
izing and transforming the old subjects of physiology and hygiene. 
THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS. 
In addition to the national societies whose efforts are directed 
toward preventing the great loss of life and the untold economic 
waste caused by tuberculosis, practically all the States and larger
-P-A-G-E-480
  426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
cities have antituberculosis leagues or societies organized for a simi- 
lar purpose. Besides these there are many local societies whose 
work consists largely in efforts against the spread of this disease. 
The main work of these organizations may be summarized as follows: 
(1) They are teaching the people through printed matter, exhibi- 
tions, and lectures that tuberculosis is a contagious disease and that 
those who are seriously afflicted are menaces to the public health 
unless they are prevented from mingling with the people in the cus- 
tomary way. They are pointing out the fact that during the process 
of coughing and spitting great numbers of the bacilli are thrown from 
the mouth, and that when these are dried and lifted into the air they 
are liable to infect others, especially those whose physical condition 
exhibits a low degree of resisting power. As a result of this agita- 
tion some States are establishing county tuberculosis sanitariums. 
Wisconsin is a conspicuous instance. 
(2) They are teaching the people that tuberculosis is a curable 
disease if taken in its early stages. The treatment advocated in- 
cludes living and sleeping in the open air, cessation from fatiguing 
toil, and abundance of nourishing food. Many societies and business 
organizations are going further and in a more or less cooperative way 
are undertaking to make it possible for patients of slender means to 
quit work and give their time and energy to overcoming the disease 
before it is too late. Furthermore, they are teaching the people that 
the best time to fight is before they are attacked. Hence there has 
been prepared especially valuable literature on the great need of 
fresh air and on open-air sleeping apartments for all. Some of these 
publications contain not only a statement of needs, but specific and 
detailed information of how to meet them. In this regard they have 
done better service than the average textbooks on hygiene, and 
should be in the hands of all teachers, especially rural-school teachers. 
(8) They are acquainting the people with the fact that many 
children suffering with what hitherto has been, considered mere skin 
diseases are in reality tuberculous; and thus they have paved the 
way for more rational treatment of such children. 
(4) Bad housing in congested centers has been a fertile source of 
contagion, and hence people have to be taught that it is in the long 
run more economical to prevent illness by living under wholesome 
conditions than it is to economize on rent at the risk of health. 
Many organizations are working for legislation which will force the 
construction of more sanitary apartment and tenement houses and 
will condemn those now in existence which are insanitary and gener- 
ally unwholesome. People must be protected not only from their 
own. ignorance but also from the avarice of landlords. 
(5) Boards of education have been importuned by these societies 
to make greater provision for open-air schools into which may be

METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING. 427 
gathered those children who are anemic, and whose inheritance and 
home conditions predispose to tuberculous infection. A number of 
cities owe their open-air schools to the influence these societies have 
brought to bear in a legitimate way upon the general public. 
CLEANLINESS. 
A great number of societies, notably the charity organizations, 
have found it necessary and valuable to direct their work toward 
teaching the poorer classes of people in a definite way the dangers 
due to personal uncleanliness and dirty methods of handling food 
supplies. They have followed up this line of work by inaugurating 
a movement for public bathing facilities and opportunities for laun- 
dry work. Such work has brought to the attention of the general 
public the utter lack among the very poor of facilities for bathing 
and the absence of decent oppertenitiss for washing garments and 
bedclothes. Unless people have the means of keeping clean, it is 
more or less a waste of time and energy to preach to them the value 
of cleanliness. If the laws of a State and the ordinances of a city 
permit families to occupy a single room in a tenement house where 
not even running water is furnished, not to mention room for a bath- 
tub or a laundry, it is a foregone conclusion that the health of such 
people and of those with whom they come in contact will be jeopard- 
ized. Surely no more fundamental health teaching for such people 
ean be undertaken than to insist that better sanitary conditions be 
provided in tenements, and then that those whe occupy them shall 
live accordingly. Otherwise, it is a hopeless task to instruct them 
in wholesome living and the hygienic care of their children. Many 
poverty-stricken people from foreign lands are willing and ready to 
hear the gospel of cleanliness, but they can not obey its doctrines 
for lack of the necessary means. 
SEX HYGIENE, 
Perhaps no health topic now before the general public has received 
more attention from the various voluntary societies during the past 
year than that of sex hygiene. The nature of the subject has unfor- 
tunately attracted a good many people to its consideration out of 
mere curiosity, but in fairness it must be said that the novelty of 
the subject has been largely due to the general ignorance of the 
public regarding such matters. In practically every State and city 
in the country societies have been organized for the prevention of 
venereal diseases, and most of them have published a large amount of 
material calling attention to conditions and suggesting various 
remedies. Perhaps the most extensive method of work used has 
been that of lectures before organizations of all kinds, such as  
-P-A-G-E-482
  428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
women’s clubs, men’s clubs, churches, Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tions, Young Women’s Christian Associations, civic organizations, 
teachers’ associations, clubs and societies of manufacturing plants, 
etc. The secretary of one of the State societies organized for the 
prevention of social diseases states that— 
as a result of a two years’ campaign by this method the whole State has been aroused 
to the importance of the subject, so that every association and club in the State is 
undertaking as a part of its work to instruct the people to develop means of eradicating 
these diseases. 
Many societies have secured permission from school boards to 
present. this subject to the high-school children of cities and to the 
patrons of the school. A number of prominent cities throughout 
the country are preparing to organize courses of instruction in 
this subject to be presented to the pupils of the upper grades and to 
those of the high schools. A large number of books have been 
written to guide teachers and parents in the instruction of children 
in the subject, but no thoroughly satisfactory plan has yet been 
formulated, and possibly it will take a number of years of experience 
and consideration to develop an acceptable course of study on this 
subject for the public schools. 
A committee has been appointed in connection with the depart- 
ment of school patrons of the National Education Association to 
prepare a course in sex hygiene for use in normal schools. Mr. 
W. B. Owen, of the Chicago Teachers’ College, is chairman of this 
committee. A report on this work will be presented at the February 
meeting of the department of superintendence at Richmond, Va. 
One method of general education along the line of sex hygiene 
which has been used with marked influence during the past year 
has been that of exhibits. Starting with the remarkable exhibit 
which was made in connection with the Fifteenth International Con- 
gress on Hygiene and Demography in Washington in September, 1912, 
the use of such exhibits has grown enormously during the past year, 
and they have invariably attracted a notable amount of attention. 
A thousand copies of Brieux’s play, Damaged Goods, have been 
scattered throughout the country. Some cities, notably Syracuse, 
N. Y., have made what they designate “moral surveys” and have 
published detailed studies of results of their investigations. The 
Syracuse society for the prevention of social diseases recommended 
to the bureau of health the advisability of introducing the teaching 
of sex hygiene in the public schools. Throughout the length and 
breadth of the country the results of various investigations into 
the extent of social diseases have been studied and the people have 
been aroused in an unusual way. 
Possibly no topic presented at the Fourth International Congress on 
School Hygiene at Buffalo, held in August, created so much interest
-P-A-G-E-483
  METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING, 429 
and attracted so much attention as the addresses on sex hygiene. 
There has been some fear expressed in various quarters that the 
general teaching of facts relative to this topic might in many cases 
be unwise and harmful. If I may judge from the evidence I have 
gathered from looking through the reports and-examining the results 
of the work of the various organizations throughout the country, 
I would say that thus far the discussion and agitation of this subject 
have not passed the bounds of reason and have been, on the whole, 
conducted in a sane and safe way. Of course any new subject has 
to be delivered from overzealous enthusiasts who are ready to join 
in any new movement merely for the sake of self-advertisement. 
Fortunately, I think these have been few in number and the general 
movement has been in the hands of well-balanced and morally safe 
people. It would be impossible to estimate the value of the tre- 
mendous amount of teaching, direct or indirect, that has been done 
on this subject during the past year, but truth presented in an 
unselfish and unbiased fashion is always powerful. ‘The main precau- 
tion now: to be taken, if I may be permitted a ‘judgment in this 
connection, is to limit as far as possible the overstatement and 
exaggeration of supposed facts. Certain printed documents ‘have 
been spread broadcast which would tend to lead to the belief that from 
30 to 40 per cent of the people of the country have been or are now 
afflicted with one of the unnamable diseases. What the truth is 
nobody knows, and it would be much safer and better to leave 
estimates of the extent of these diseases until far more authoritative 
information has been collected. 
SCHOOL HYGIENE. 
A great awakening has taken place in the past few years with regard 
to school hygiene and school sanitation. This movement has fur- 
nished a theme for a very large number of women’s clubs, educa- 
tional associations, medical societies, home and school leagues, and 
a host of other organizations. All people are interested in the educa- 
tion and development of the children of the Nation and much good 
has been accomplished by these combined, if not concerted, efforts 
to make our schoolhouses more sanitary and to furnish larger play- 
grounds for the children. Medical inspection of school children 
has grown at a rapid rate, and this growth has been due in no small 
measure to the public sentiment aroused by these local societies. It 
would be impossible to state with exactness what particular measures 
have received the most attention, but among them would be found 
medical inspection, ventilation, the need of open-air schools, school 
lunches, playgrounds, and sanitary drinking fountains. Of course 
a great.many other topics have been considered and emphasized, but 
these topics have doubtless received a larger share of consideration. 
 
-P-A-G-E-484
    
430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The educational work in school hygiene which has been under- 
taken in this voluntary way has proceeded generally through meet- 
ings of mothers and teachers, before whom those who have made a 
special study of school hygiene have discussed matters in a simple 
and untechnical way. The movement for school lunches is due 
largely to the initiative of those home and school leagues and women’s 
clubs which have undertaken to minister to the needs of the anemic 
children in attendance upon the schools. In connection with open- 
air school work, as well as with the regular classes, this service has 
been of great value and promises even larger returns. If I may be 
permitted to suggest one topic which these organizations should 
study with more care and should bring to the attention of local 
authorities in a definite way, it is that of the great need for larger 
school grounds. Despite ali that schoolmen can do, city and county 
boards of education constantly persist in locating school buildings on 
meager plots of ground and often in congested and noisy centers. 
Such locations are far more serious blunders than the average com- 
munity conceives. Dirt and dust, noise and confusion, lack of 
playgrounds, danger from fire, and more serious danger from moral 
contamination must be contended with as the result of such blunders. 
Tam persuaded that if the various civic and social clubs of the smaller 
cities of America were to devote a part of their time and energy 
to teaching the people the seriousness of locating great school build- 
ings in such places a marked improvement for the betterment of these 
conditions would be immediately seen. A multitude of topics is 
considered in this campaign for better health conditions in the school 
and, generally speaking, the work has been wisely, courageously, 
and unselfishly done. The evidence shows, however, that the time 
has come when the societies must depend more upon the guidance 
of those who have special knowledge in these fields in addition to the 
desire to be of service to the children. Commendable progress is 
being made in many cities by introducing departments of hygiene and 
sanitation which not only have to do with the sanitation of school 
buildings and school appliances, but with the physical education 
and development of the child. Many school improvement leagues 
and similar associations have published leaflets and various sorts 
of helps designed to serve the rural school-teachers especially. As 
an example of this, the Alabama School Improvement Association, 
which is affiliated with the State education association, distributed 
last year 2,500 health circulars. These were all sent to the teachers 
of rural schools. When one considers how little these teachers have 
in the way of helps and suggestions outside of the ordinary textbooks, 
one can appreciate more fully the real value of such work. 
The park and playground movement, which is closely related to 
the movement for school hygiene, has received a great impetus during
-P-A-G-E-485
        METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING, 431 
the past year. This has come about through many agencies, but 
back of it all one can see the effects of the gospel preached by the 
various organizations. To cite a single example, the superintendent 
of playgrounds of Oakland, Cal., has 12 supervised playgrounds and 
recreation centers under his supervision ; 10 of these are open through- 
out the whole year. They are equipped with outdoor gymnasia, 
athletic fields, tennis courts, swings, and slides, and are furnished 
with all sorts of opportunities for games. In connection with some 
of the playgrounds there are social halls for recreational purposes, 
shower baths, dressing rooms, lockers, and all the equipment of a 
modern club. These are open and free to the public. While such a 
city as Oakland, with its equable climate, has many advantages 
over those in more severe climates, nevertheless, much more can be 
done than is done to give the children a chance to play and thereby 
develop in a natural way the powers of their bodies. 
MOUTH HYGIENE. 
The oral hygiene committee of the National Dental Association 
has outlined for its year’s work the further education of the dental 
profession regarding prophylactic treatment of the surface of the 
teeth for the prevention of decay, the introduction of questions on 
oral prophylaxis for State examining boards to use in connection 
with applicants for a State license, the establishment of courses in 
prophylaxis in colleges, the extension of popular lectures on mouth 
hygiene, and the further extension of the membership of the organ- 
ization. 
The National Mouth Hygiene Association is proposing to extend 
its work by organizing auxiliaries in various communities throughout 
the whole country, and by extensive publicity campaigns to secure 
a large membership in their organization and to raise funds for the 
establishment and maintenance of dental clinics. This association 
proposes to endow these clinics for the purpose of furnishing dental 
service and treatment without cost to the worthy poor. It also is 
attempting to furnish to the general public full information relative 
to the proper method of caring for the teeth and the kind of food 
especially necessary for children to give the teeth and jaws proper 
exercise and normal development. 
Many local and State organizations affiliated with these national 
societies are rendering their communities special service in teaching 
the people the care of the teeth and in increasing the number of 
dental clinics. This phase of public hygiene has used to good ad- 
vantage exhibits consisting of charts, stereopticon illustrations, and 
even a moving-picture show entitled “The toothache.” The pub- 
lished material sent out by the various societies has been extensive 
and useful.
-P-A-G-E-486
  432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
HYGIENE OF INFANCY. 
The topic of the hygiene of the baby has received increasing 
attention throughout the year. Various organizations have done 
excellent service in their efforts to teach mothers the care of children, 
proper preparation of food, and in the general attempt to reduce infant 
mortality through the extension of visiting nurses, milk stations, 
“Jittle mothers’ leagues,’ recreation camps, and clinics. Out of this 
more careful study of the baby and its needs has grown what is 
termed the “baby show.” By this is meant an organized effort to 
fix the attention of people upon the healthy baby and a study 
of the conditions which produce perfect specimens of the human 
infant. These baby shows have, therefore, incidentally been associ- 
ated with a general awakening along the lines of inheritance and 
eugenics. It puts emphasis upon the health side and serves to 
develop a standard of normal infancy. This phase of the work has 
created a good deal of enthusiasm, and directly or indirectly has 
taught people the great advantage physically and mentally to those 
children whose inheritance and care are all they should be. Many 
women’s clubs have declared that these baby shows have been the 
most helpful means that they have used in emphasizing the value of 
infant hygiene. 
Closely related with this line of work there has developed in many 
cities special attention to the proper and considerate care of expec- 
tant mothers. This work has been especially emphasized in Boston. 
HEALTH TEACHING THROUGH NURSES. 
Medical inspection is never complete in a city until a competent 
body of visiting nurses are associated with the physicians in their 
work. These are sent to the homes and do what is known as “ follow- 
up work.’? Here, coming in contact as they do with the conditions 
under which children live, they have a splendid opportunity of 
teaching nearly all phases of general hygiene and sanitation. But 
the work of public school nurses is only a part of the general oppor- 
tunity offered to trained nurses. Numerous societies, city, State, 
and national, are introducing this work more and more. They 
have found that the best place to teach health and sanitation is in the 
home. There they learn at first-hand the conditions under which 
people live, and in this way know what information is most vital and 
immediately necessary. 
Perhaps the most promising and extensive work of this nature 
is that connected with the American Red Cross rural nursing service. 
This is a national organization of nurses who have had special train- 
ing and experience in publi¢ health work and other forms of social 
service. They are expected to go into the country and organize 
 
-P-A-G-E-487
    
METHODS AND MEANS OF HEALTH TEACHING, 433 
classes in home care of the sick and to instruct the people in the care 
of patients. The Red Cross rural nursing service, it is expected, 
will eventually cover every section of the country. Up to this time 
nurses have been located in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and 
* Michigan. The service is in process of organization and will require 
a good deal of time for its completion; but when the work is thor- 
oughly organized and sufficient nurses are employed, this service 
will constitute one of the most important health bodies in the whole 
country. Miss Fannie C. Clement is superintendent of this part of 
the Red Cross work. 
RURAL SANITATION. 
The need of knowledge of sanitation and of appliances in rural 
districts has not been dealt with adequately as compared with the 
interest these matters have awakened in cities. The chief reason 
for this backwardness is doubtless due to the fact that most organized 
efforts to further the conservation of health have developed in towns 
and cities, and these have been primarily interested in the welfare of 
their own immediate environment. Country people have been slow 
to organize themselves for the purpose of aiding in making country life 
more wholesome and healthful. There are, however, many notable 
exceptions. As an example, the New York State Grange at its 
annual session in February, 1913, recommended a visiting-nurse 
service for the country districts of the State. This movement is a 
very important one, and when such service is established it will 
afford one of the most significant health-teaching agencies possible in 
rural districts; for wherever a well prepared and thoughtful nurse 
goes she will invariably exert a helpful influence by teaching ‘the 
proper care of the sick and better protection against sickness. It is 
astonishing how little country people know of the causes of typhoid 
fever, and of how to protect themselves against it. The special 
needs of rural communities from the hygienic point of view are a 
safe water supply, sanitary toilets, and abatement of the fly nuisance. 
Household ventilation and the proper care of food supplies are 
extremely important also. This knowledge is not brought to the 
attention of country folk as it should be. 
The Negro Organization Society of Virginia undertook during the 
year a splendid line of rural health work in one county of that State. 
Their executive secretary was sent out not only to visit schools and 
help bring about in them better health conditions, but also to work 
with the country people and strive to induce them to construct 
sanitary privies at their homes, to ventilate their churches and their 
bedrooms, and especially to protect their wells and springs from 
contamination. The country churches have been used as the centers 
for this work and commendable and encouraging results have followed.

HOOKWORM DISEASE. 
The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hook- 
worm Disease has done more real teaching in the country districts 
of the Southern States than any other one agency. The men who 
have engaged in this work have gone to the people, talked with them, 
examined them, and studied their home conditions. Best of all, 
they have made them believe through the cures they have wrought, 
and thus hundreds of thousands have learned for the first time that 
diseases have specific causes, and that when those causes are removed 
the diseases disappear. 
Dr. Wickliffe Rose, administrative secretary of the Rockefeller 
Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of the Hookworm Disease, 
states that since the commission was organized in October, 1909, 
and up to June 30, 1913, 491,883 people had been treated for hook- 
worm disease, and that nearly half of the number were treated during 
the year ending June 30, 1913. When it is known that each of the 
11 Southern States is cooperating in this work and that in each State 
a staff of physicians and expert microscopists are giving their entire 
time to it, and all are teaching the people the sanitary measures 
necessary to prevent infection, one realizes the tremendous educa- 
tional achievements of this campaign. 
The poor people of the South have been greatly imposed upon by 
patent-medicine venders; for ailments, such as are introduced by 
these parasitic worms, have furnished the condition for an abundant 
harvest for all sorts of quacks with their make-believe remedies. It 
this campaign has done nothing more than to educate the people to 
the general causes of the disease and the need of proper sanitary 
measures to prevent continued infection, untold good has been 
accomplished. But thousands of weak and anemic children have 
been cured and the good results thereby obtained are lessons for the 
whole community. This work has required a great deal of skill and 
patience in dealing with people who were unwilling to believe, and, 
in a way, unwilling to be taught. However, the change in the atti- 
tude of the masses regarding this disease is a striking proof of how 
truth will prevail when it is presented in a clear and acceptable 
manner.

CHAPTER XX. 
PROGRESS IN EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN 
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS DURING THE YEAR 1912-13. 
By Licurner Witmer. 
Director of the Psychological Laboratory and Clinic, University of Pennsylvania. 
This report is based upon Bulletin, 1911, No. 14, by Drs. Ayres, 
Van Sickle, and Witmer, entitled ‘‘Provision for Exceptional Children 
in Public Schools.” The report therefore naturally divides itself into 
two parts—a consideration of additions made during the year 1912-13 
to the various classes for exceptional children, and a consideration of 
the facilities offered by universities and other educational institutions 
for the training of teachers of exceptional children. 
CLASSES FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. 
To collect material for the first section of this report, questionnaires 
were sent to 52 State and Territorial superintendents of public instruc- 
tion and to 883 city superintendents, a total of 935. The question- 
naire was based upon the classification of work for exceptional chil- 
dren, as previously adopted in Bulletin, 1911, No. 14. It asked what 
progress had been made in the year 1912-13 along these lines, i. e., 
what new provision had been made. The blank questionnaire was 
sent to the superintendent of every town listed in the tables in the 
1911 bulletin, and in addition to every other town large enough to 
figure in the list of the American Book Co. Return envelopes were 
inclosed. To appreciate the full significance of the replies, it is 
necessary to know the form of questionnaire employed. This was as 
follows: 
QUESTIONNAIRE, 
Dzar Sir: The United States Commissioner of Education has requested me to 
prepare a brief report on the progress made in the education of exceptional children 
in this country during the school year 1912-13, Will you be good enough to fill up 
the following questionnaire and return it to me in the inclosed envelope as early as 
possible before September 15? If you feel inclined to add a few words, describing 
just what new features or extensions of the work for exceptional children have been 
introduced in your school system during the year, I should greatly appreciate any 
additional information of this sort. It will be very helpful also if you will send mea 
copy of your latest printed report for purposes of comparison. 
Very truly, yours, 
(Signed) Ligurner Witmer.

What NEW provision has been made in your school system in the year 1912-13 for the 
education of exceptional children? Please tell how many classes have been 
started, how large these classes are, how many teachers, and any other details 
which are important and interesting:

The inquiry was limited to the Sitio systems; private 
schools for backward and defective children, and State institutions 
for the blind and deaf and feeble-minded being omitted for several 
reasons. Most cogent of all is the fact that private schools are no- 
where listed—indeed many of them expressly avoid such listing. It 
would therefore be impossible to obtain a sufficiently complete 
address list of these schools to make it worth while to ask them for a 
report of progress, even if their progress were likely to be of a kind 
that could be reported. As for the newly established private schools, 
the ones most important to an inquiry of this sort, the case is hopeless. 
No one but the few people directly interested knows where they are 
or what they are doing. The reason for excluding State institutions 
was somewhat different. It was expected that they would be reported 
upon by the State superintendents of public instruction, but all except 
three failed to mention anything of the kind in their reports, even 
when they made any report at all. The gratifying exceptions were 
Philippine Islands, Missouri, and Idaho, which will be mentioned later. 
Twenty State superintendents out of a possible 52 made returns, 
about the same proportion as held for the returns of both State and 
city superintendents. In all, 330 questionnaires were returned 
(counting the report for the Philippine Islands as covering also 
Manila), or nearly 35 per cent of the number sent out. This in itself 
is a striking index of the apathy prevailing among administrators of 
public education with respect to a problem which should arouse their 
keenest interest and heartiest cooperation. 
Twelve State superintendents had nothing to report. Two of 
these, the superintendents of Ohio and California, said they had ‘no 
statistics on this subject.” Two others, Maryland and Kentucky, 
were evidently aware of what was done in certain large towns, and 
referred us to the local superintendents for information. Another, 
Maine, remarked that ‘the information ig more readily given for a 
single school rather than the State.’ The superintendent of South
-P-A-G-E-491
  
EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. 437 
Carolina forwarded his report for 1912. Pennsylvania reported 
“nothing new was added to the legislation this year”; Texas, Arkan- 
sas, Iowa, Colorado, and Oregon apparently grasped the meaning of 
the inquiry, but had no progress to report. The returns from city 
superintendents, however, showed that Austin, Tex., and Little Rock, 
Ark., had made provision for exceptional children for the first time, 
and three cities in Iowa and three in Colorado had extended their 
provision. 
Seven States reported progress, as did also the Philippine Islands. 
Satisfactory detailed reports were received from New York, New Jer- 
sey, and Wisconsin. Michigan has passed a law giving the care of 
blind babies to the State board of education, and at the time of writing 
(September, 1913) one child was cared for. Missouri has provided for 
a State reform school for negro girls. Kansas has a new law making 
night schools possible as a part of the regular school organization. 
The Idaho Legislature has made an appropriation for building a school 
for the feeble-minded. In Manila a school for the deaf and blind was 
established, in which were five classes for deaf and three classes for 
blind children. Two other institutions have been established and 
conducted by the Catholic Church. The first of these, the Hospicio 
de San José in Manila, is an orphanage giving academic and industrial 
training to about 250 boys and girls. The second is a reformatory for 
boys at Lolomboy, Bulacan, where industrial as well as academic 
training is given. 
As might have been expected, the reports from city superintend- 
ents, while preserving the same meager proportion of returns, were 
numerically more impressive and were much more satisfying in detail. 
Although information was plainly requested about new provision for 
exceptional children in the year 1912-13, a great many included 
provisions which had been in force for several years past, and this 
necessitated a laborious checking over of all returns by comparing 
them with the tables in the 1911 bulletin. Other superintendents 
anticipated history by setting forth what they were planning to do 
next year, and these data had likewise to be carefully eliminated. 
The greatest progress in organization and the most interesting 
report were made in Philadelphia. Dr. Cornman’s letter inclosing 
the questionnaire is an illuminating example of brains applied to 
educational problems. I quote from Dr. Cornman’s letter at length, 
because it introduces an administrative change in the nomenclature 
of special classes which can be recommended for adoption: 
‘You will see from the inclosed questionnaire that little new provision in the way of 
additional classes and equipment for exceptional children was made during the year 
1912-13. During that year, however, the entire corps of special class teachers, prin- 
cipals having special classes, and district superintendents interested were organized 
in a committee which did effective work in the study of problems connected with 
these classes and in the preparation of suggestive outlines of work, daily programs, etc.   
 
-P-A-G-E-492
    438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
This material will be mimeographed and tried out in the classroom with the idea of 
printing it later with the modifications suggested by experience. 
You will be specially interested, I think, to learn that, as a result of the considera- 
tion of the classification of the children of the so-called ‘‘disciplinary’’and “backward ”’ 
classes, a somewhat different scheme of grading and nomenclature than that heretofore 
used has been worked out. So many of the pupils of the disciplinary classes were 
found to be very backward, or even mentally deficient, and so many of the backward 
classes were of the mixed type, that the distinction did not seem useful enough to 
retain it. It seemed better to lay the emphasis entirely upon the ways and means of 
securing the better development of the pupil. Using the term you use in the psycho- 
logical clinic, the classes may be designated as ‘‘orthogenic,’’ this term superseding 
the terms ‘‘backward’’ and ‘“‘disciplinary’’ heretofore employed. It has the advan- 
tage of characterizing the classes by the aim or method, rather than by terms more or 
less opprobriously descriptive of the children themselves. The same practice can be 
applied to other types of special classes; for example, ‘orthopedic’? for crippled chil- 
dren, “‘open-window’’ for under-nourished and anemic children, ‘‘open-air’’ forthose 
with active tuberculosis who must be by law segregated in separate buildings. 
It has been customary heretofore to designate the grade of the children as nearly as 
possible in the special classes in rough accordance with the grading in the regular 
classes, the special class under such a plan having perhaps several of the eight elemen- 
tary grades represented in its enrollment. This is so inaccurate, and hasso many other 
obvious disadvantages, that it seems better to employ a simpler grading as follows: 
“A”’ designating pupils of low mentality held in special classes pending proper 
institutional provision. 
“B” designating pupils of a grade of mentality above the institutional type, but 
not to be regarded as candidates for return to regular classes. 
“0” designating retarded pupils of higher mentality who ought to be restored, if 
ossible, to regular grades; also pupils able mentally to do work of the regular grades, 
ut who, by reason of moral deficiency, can not be permitted to attend 4 them, these 
pupils to remain in special classes until better provision can be made for them. 
It is believed that these classifications will encourage the teacher to approach the 
problem from other points of view than that of the regular classroom, and assist her in 
escaping from some of the distinctions, ideals, and traditions of regular class work 
which do not properly apply to the special class. 
The greatest contrast to this letter is offered by a superintendent 
whose interest, it is easy to see, is far removed from the education of 
exceptional children. He says: 
Under separate cover we are sending you a copy of the school laws of You 
will see by referring to this book that most of the questions which you have asked in 
your letter of August 13 are taken care of either through the State schools, county 
organizations, or our parochial and vocational schools. 
A letter, which carries with it a rich flavor of the fine old early 
Victorian style in education, comes from a southern city. The super- 
intendent writes:   
Ours is a public-school system; the object and effort is to give the children a practical 
and substantial education, such as will fit them for the practical problems of life. 
We do what we can to fit them for good citizenship; to educate them to understand 
that success in life for each individual depends upon well-directed individual efforts; 
that commercial honor, commercial integrity, is a large factor toward success; to live

relieving the family, father and mother, of all the burden and responsibility of rearing 
their family. 
It is pleasant to note that in spite of this superintendent’s struggles, 
his school system is included in the table of cities making progress, 
on the strength of ungraded classes for backward, late-entering, and 
gifted children, manual training, and vacation schools. 
In compiling the returns, the first table (Table I) was constructed 
to cover cities which were not included in the previous bulletin and 
were therefore regarded as having for the first time made provision 
for exceptional children. The second table (Table II) covers all the 
cities which were included in that bulletin and have since extended 
their provision by adding to the number of their classes or by start- 
ing classes for different kinds of children. Wherever the data per- 
mitted, a quantitative record was made of the number of each kind 
of class which had been organized. Where numbers were not forth- 
coming, a cross in the column indicates a qualitative improvement, 
i. e., something has been done of unknown extent. 
Thirty-six cities in 24 States made provision for exceptional 
children for the first time; while 162 cities in 34 States extended their 
provision. Ninety-three cities which already provided for excep- 
tional children had no progress to report, and 15 cities reported that 
no such provision had ever been made. 
The most interesting from the point of view of this study are 
naturally the 36 cities which have newly come into the ranks of the 
progressive. They are very widely scattered over the country, the 
largest number in one State being 4 in California, followed by 3 in 
Pennsylvania, and 3 in Washington. The distribution by States and 
geographical divisions is summarized in Table I1I. In Table IV is 
summarized the distribution of the 162 cities which extended their 
provision. In addition to the classified returns, four questionnaires 
were received which could not be classified, because they were un- 
signed and the postmarks were obliterated. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. 
Courses in psychology and pedagogy, having the aim to fit teachers 
and other students for professional work with exceptional childrep, 
increased greatly in number during the year 1913. Many of the 
higher institutions of learning do not yet offer courses which either 
directly or indirectly serve to train teachers and professional experts 
with exceptional children, but several have undertaken this task, and 
teachers of exceptional children are now assured satisfactory courses 
at a number of institutions. Many also offered a more or less thorough 
training to students in the college and graduate school. 
Perhaps it is but fair to say that these courses are most fully repre- 
sented in the college, graduate school, and summer session of the  
-P-A-G-E-494
    440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
University of Pennsylvania. This institution was the first to offer 
courses, the direct object of which was to train teachers of backward 
children. As early as the year 1897 such courses were offered and 
a special class for backward children was organized and held daily 
sessions during the summer school. A psychological clinic also was 
first organized at this institution, and has been employed to demon- 
strate to teachers and other students the characteristics of these 
children, as well as to investigate their mental and physical status 
and to suggest approved methods of educational treatment. A 
number of institutions now provide such courses, chiefly at the sum- 
mer session, three offer instruction through a psychological clinic, 
and three conduct one or more classes of exceptional children for 
purposes of student observation. 
Up to the present time, with the exception of one class, the work 
has been confined to the various types of backward and feeble-minded 
children ordinarily to be found in classes for backward children in 
connection with the public schools. At the summer session of 1912 
there was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania a special 
class for exceptionally bright children. There can be little doubt 
that this work in time will be extended to cover other groups of 
exceptional children than the merely backward. During the summer 
session of 1913 five classes for backward children were conducted at 
New York University, and a class was conducted for the first time 
at the University of California. In addition, the Vineland Training 
School (New Jersey) followed its practice of several years and most 
generously opened this institution to teachers of backward children. 
The institution provides board and training for these teachers. The 
types of children to be observed in this institution naturally are 
institutional cases, who properly should not be in public-school 
classes at all, but many of them are of mental grade the equivalent 
of perhaps about 50 per cent of the children to be found in the back- 
ward classes of our larger cities. 
The State of Pennsylvania may justly take pride in the fact that 
two of its universities are offering courses of instruction and providing 
a psychological clinic and a special class for observation. In 1913 
the University of Pittsburgh at its summer session offered four 
courses and presented a special class for observation; moreover, this 
work is continued during the regular academic session, and a circular 
announces that a special class, a Montessori class, will be organized 
this fall. This class, owing to the clinico-psychological methods of 
the Montessori system, falls within the type of educational work to 
be considered in this report. 
Tn addition to the two Pennsylvania institutions, New York Univer- 
sity offered in the summer session of 1913 nine courses and conducted 
five special classes. The University of California offered five courses,
-P-A-G-E-495
  EDUCATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN. 441 
and conducted a special class and clinical examinations; indeed, all 
the courses offered by the department of education at the summer ses- 
sion, with two exceptions, fell within the field of modern clinical psy- 
chology. Colorado State Teachers College demonstrated the position 
which this work has attained by offering a one-week’s course on 
growth and retardation as a part of its general course prescribed for 
all students. In addition, lectures on exceptional children were 
given to special sections by four different instructors. At Columbia 
University a course was offered in pathological psychology and one on 
the psychology of childhood and exceptional children. At Cornell Uni- 
versity a course in mental and physical tests for school children might 
be said to be related to this work. Harvard University offered a 
course on the psychology of the abnormal; the University of Mon- 
tana offered several courses on exceptional children, one of them by 
Miss Morrison, a consulting school psychologist of Hibbing, Minn. 
The University of Washington, Seattle, offered a course on the edu- 
cation of exceptional children; Wittenberg College, Springfield, Ohio, 
offered a course on abnormal, backward, and feeble-minded children. 
The following list of the courses at all institutions of learning in 
this country which offer instruction on the psychology and pedagogy 
of exceptional children has been prepared because of the assistance 
which it may be expected to afford teachers in learning what kind 
of instruction may be secured. As far as possible the effort has been 
made to list all courses by title, indicating the number of hours and 
whether offered to college, graduate, or summer-school students. 
Where it is not otherwise stated, one hour means one hour a week, 
or one hour a day during the summer session of six weeks.

  NEW SCHOOLS AND THEIR FORMS OF ORGANIZATION, 
Nine new schools for the deaf were opened in the United States 
during the year 1912-13. Two of these—the Arizona school, which 
is a department of the University of Arizona, and the Austine Insti- 
tution, an endowed school at Brattleboro, Vt.—are public residential 
schools, providing free education for all the deaf in their respective 
States and deriving their support wholly or in part from State ap- 
propriations. Every State in the Union now has one or more schools 
of this class except Delaware, New Hampshire, Nevada, and 
Wyoming. These four States do not, however, neglect their deaf 
children, but arrange for their education in other States. There are 
64 public residential schools, which contained on November 10, 
1912, 10,837 pupils, who constitute 82 per cent of all the deaf under 
instruction in the United States. These schools offer deaf children 
better care and supervision than the average home, exert a good in- 
fluence out of school as well as during school hours, add to an 
academic education a thorough industrial training, impart moral and 
religious but not sectarian instruction, and at the end of the course 
send them out into -the world upright, intelligent, self-supporting, 
wealth-producing citizens. Home ties during the school period are 
maintained by a long summer vacation, 
Six of the new schools established during the year are public day 
schools. The number of day schools for the deaf in the United 
States (70) is now larger than that of the residential schools, but 
their pupils, numbering 1,773, constitute only 13 per cent of the 
whole number. In California, Michigan, and Wisconsin the day 
schools are supported by per capita appropriations from the State, 
453  
-P-A-G-E-508
  454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
while classrooms are furnished and teachers are employed by the city 
or town in which the school is carried on; in the other States they 
are supported wholly by the city or town. -The day school permits 
the deaf child to live at home, which as a rule is the right place. for 
children, and insures him out of school hours an environment of 
hearing persons. These are real advantages where home conditions 
are favorable, but in many cases the influences of the home and of the 
street are such as to counteract the good influences of the school, 
The children, moreover, are exposed to accidents in going to and from 
school, their education suffers from irregularity of attendance, and 
except in large cities the schools are so small that proper grading and 
classification are impossible. 
One of the schools opened during the past“year is a private estab- 
lishment. There are 20 private and denominational schools for the 
deaf in the United States, containing 583 pupils, which is 4 per cent 
of the whole number under instruction. They have the same reasons 
for existence as similar schools for hearing children; some of them 
offer more luxury and more individual attention than the public 
schools, and others insure the special kind of religious teaching and 
influence that the parents deem essential, 
There has been a marked improvement in the status of schools for 
the deaf within recent years in two directions: First, in the recogni- 
tion more generally accorded them as educational rather than chari- 
table institutions; second, in their greater emancipation from political 
interference and control, 
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF ARE EDUCATIONAL, NOT CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. 
When the first schools for the deaf were established in this country 
nearly a hundred years ago, though their object was educational, they 
were regarded as charitable institutions. They owed their existence 
to the contributions of charitable individuals; they were modeled 
after the European schools, and at that time not only schools for the 
deaf, but all schools in Europe, except those for the wealthy, were 
charitable institutions. In America, however, the duty of the State 
to provide free schools for its children had already been recognized, 
and the supporters of the schools for the deaf were not slow to per- 
ceive that their pupils had the same right as other children to educa- 
tion at public expense. The justice of this claim was recognized and 
appropriations were made by the legislatures for this purpose, 
usually in the form of per capita payments to the incorporated 
schools which had been organized and endowed by benevolent in- 
dividuals or societies. But the old idea of charity, under which the 
schools had been established, persisted for a long time, for it was 
fostered by the unfortunate names of “ asylum ” and “ institution °— 
especially “ asylum ”—given to the early schools, and it was strength-
-P-A-G-E-509
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF, 455 
ened by the circumstance that the pupils received free board and 
lodging. In fact, in the eyes of the law the 19 incorporated schools 
for the deaf possessing some endowment funds—2 in Connecticut, 
1 in the District of Columbia, 1 in Maryland, 3 in Massachusetts, 8 in 
New York,3 in Pennsylvania, and 1 in Vermont—are charitable insti- 
tutions from a legal point of view, as are all endowed schools, colleges, 
and universities. But the legal point of view is not the general point 
of view; our schools, colleges, and universities are educational in 
their purpose, and they are, therefore, universally regarded as educa- 
tional institutions. So also ought our endowed schools for the deaf 
to be regarded, and more and more the public has come to understand 
that. fact. 
As to the 45 public residential schools for the deaf which have 
received no endowment from individuals but were established and 
have always been controlled by the State, there has never been any 
good reason for regarding them as anything but educational; but the 
old nomenclature and the old habit of mind derived from the endowed 
schools still prevailed when the earlier of these strictly State schools 
were established, and it is only slowly that they have taken their 
proper place in the estimation of the public within recent years. At 
the present time only two schools still bear the legal title of “ asylum,” 
and concerning one of these the legislature at its last session, in a 
statute providing for changes in its governing board, used the name 
“school for the deaf” throughout the statute; many formerly called 
“institutions ” have had their titles changed to “schools”; legisla- 
tures are beginning to realize that they have no right to dispense 
charity, and that if the pupils receive food and shelter during the 
school term it is not as a charity, but as a necessary incident of their 
education. A recent inquiry shows that the following public resi- 
dential schools are now classified as educational and not charitable 
institutions: The Alabama, American, Arizona, Austine, California, 
Colorado, Columbia, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Ken- 
tucky, Louisiana, and Maine schools; the two schools in Maryland 
and the three schools in Massachusetts; the Minnesota, Mississippi, 
Montana, New Jersey, and New Mexico schools; the eight schools in 
New York; the North Carolina school at Raleigh; the Ohio school; 
the Oklahoma school at Sulphur; the Oregon, South Carolina, and 
Utah schools; the two schools in Virginia and the West Virginia 
school—in all 42 schools. In 1903 an inquiry similar to this was 
made. At that time the number reporting a purely educational 
classification was 21. We have, therefore, the gratifying intelligence 
that the number of public residential schools classified as educational 
and not charitable has just doubled within the past 10 years. 
A majority of the 22 public residential schools for the deaf not 
named in the above list are legally entitled “schools,” and to that
-P-A-G-E-510
  456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
extent their educational character is recognized; but some of them 
are classified by law as “charitable,” “ eleemosynary,” or “ benevo- 
Tent”; others are included with charitable and penal institutions in 
the acts making appropriations for their support; others are regarded 
as “semieducational and semicharitable”; and from two or three no 
information has been received. Two of the schools now reported as 
“charitable ”—the Texas school and the North Carolina school at 
Morganton—will probably be transferred to the list of purely edu- 
cational institutions during the coming year. 
The 70 public day schools for the deaf are a part of the common- 
school system of the cities and towns where they exist. To them and 
to the 11 private schools that are not denominational in character the 
stigma of charity has never been attached, 
FREEDOM FROM POLITICAL CONTROL. 
The second gratifying progress in the status of public residential 
schools for the deaf is in the direction of freedom from political in- 
terference and control. The endowed schools of the East have never 
had any trouble whatever from this source, but there are few of the 
Western and Southern States that have not at some period of their 
career suffered from it more or less. Many of the schools for the 
deaf have been made the football of political parties; superintendents 
have been changed with every change of administration, and men 
have been appointed who had no training or experience as teachers 
of the deaf. In one school two decades ago the superintendent was 
changed, for no other than political reasons, four times within five 
years. 
At the present time 50 of the 64 public residential schools seem to 
be definitely on a nonpartisan basis. They are the schools in Alabama, 
Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, 
Tilinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, 
New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Ver- 
mont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. In Ohio and Indiana nonpartisan 
government is now insured by very strict laws. 
Fourteen schools are not named in the above list, but it can not be 
said of all or even most of them that they are suffering at present 
from political interference or control. In some of them politics enters 
into the appointment of the governing board only, and not always 
there; but where it does or can enter there is always the possibility 
that it may easily be made to enter into the appointment of the super- 
intendent and other officers also. In others of these schools polities 
affects the position of superintendent and in one school the positions

of steward, matron, and physician. Concerning three schools no in- 
formation has been received. 
COMPULSORY EDUCATION, 
The education of the deaf is even more essential to the welfare of 
the individual and the community than the education of those who 
hear. But from mistaken motives of affection, from ignorance of the 
possibilities and the advantages of education, and sometimes for the 
sake of pecuniary gain many parents of deaf children allow them to 
grow up in ignorance or withdraw them from school before their edu- 
cation is completed. Perhaps the greater offense of the two is the 
withdrawal of children from school when they have learned enough 
to render efficient help at home or to earn wages in shop or factory, 
but not enough to prepare them properly for the duties of life. In 
one State that has an excellent school 34 per cent of the pupils who 
have entered during the past 25 years have dropped out without 
graduation or discharge. The percentage of withdrawals is probably 
equally large in most of the other States. A recent investigation by 
Dr. J. N. Tate, superintendent of the Minnesota School for the Deaf, 
shows that only 12 States at the present time have compulsory attend- 
ance laws for the deaf that are at all satisfactory, and most of these 
he regards as inadequate in some respects. 
A good law was passed by the Legislature of Indiana at its last 
session. By this law the compulsory period for the school attendance 
of the deaf is made to extend over 12 years, from the age of 7 to 19. 
The State School for the Deaf is designated as the place of in- 
struction. 
Any parent, guardian, or other person having charge of a child of school age 
not pl cally or mentally disqualified who refuses to send such child to school 
at any time during the compulsory years shall be fined from $1 to $25, to which 
may be added imprisonment in the county jail for from 2 to 90 days. Any 
parent, guardian, or other person having control of the child who shali permit 
its employment, and the person employing it, between the ages of 7 and 18 years 
(except during the summer yacation) without a certificate of discharge duly 
presented, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined from $10 to $50.    
   
Provision is made for the traveling expenses of pupils, if the 
parents are in indigent circumstances; and severe penalties are im- 
posed upon attendance officers for the neglect of their duties in rela- 
tion to deaf children. 
At the conference of superintendents and principals of American 
schools for the deaf, held at Indianapolis in the summer of 1913, a 
committee, of which Dr. Tate was made chairman, was appointed to 
collate the compulsory-education laws relating to the deaf in all the 
States and to frame a model law to be recommended for general 
adoption. A special meeting of the conference to consider and act
-P-A-G-E-512

upon the report of this committee will be held in 1914 at Staun- 
ton, Va. 
SCHOOL AGE. 
There has been a strong tendency during the past few years to 
begin the instruction of deaf children at an earlier age than formerly. 
Instead of refusing them admission until they are 10 or 12 years old, 
many schools now receive them as young as 5 or 6, and some even at 
3 or 4 years of age. 
There are both advantages and disadvantages in this lowering of 
the age of admission. On one hand, deaf children have so much to 
learn, as compared with hearing children, that their education ought 
to be begun as early as possible; for oral teaching especially it is 
important that instruction begin not later than 5 years of age. On 
the other hand, there are obvious objections to taking children away 
from their homes—as in the great majority of cases it is necessary to 
do in order that they may receive proper instruction—while they are 
still very young. 
The decision as to the proper school age for deaf children depends 
largely upon the circumstances of the individual and the facilities 
offered by the State in which he resides. Where the term of instruc- 
tion afforded by the State is limited to six or seven years, and where 
children are surrounded by favorable influences at home, probably 
10 or 12 is the best age for them to be sent to school, since experience 
has shown that the six or seven years following that age are those 
in which the most can be accomplished for their physical, mental, and 
moral development. 
But where, as in some States, there is no limit to the term of in- 
struction, where proper provision is made for the care and teaching 
of the little children by kindergarten or Montessori methods apart 
from the older pupils, and especially if the home influences are bad, 
it is desirable to receive them as young as 5 or 6 years of age or even 
younger. From 5 or 6 to 10 they will probably make less progress 
at school than from 10 to 14; but if, in addition to those four or five 
years under 10, they remain 6 or 7 years longer,.as they now may 
in some States, they will be able to acquire a much fuller mastery 
of the language of their fellow men, to speak and to read the lips 
better, and to reach a far more advanced stage of education in all 
respects than if their education had not begun until the years of early 
childhood were passed. 
SMALLER CLASSES. 
The teaching of deaf children, especially teaching by the oral 
method, requires much individual work; it is essential therefore that 
the classes should be smaller than is usual in classes for hearing chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-513
    
PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 459 
dren. In this respect there has been much improvement in American 
schools for the deaf within recent years. The size of classes has been 
gradually reduced from an average of 20 pupils in a class until in 
1912 the average number in oral classes was 10, in manual classes 12. 
Ten or even twelve is not an excessive number for an advanced class 
if the pupils are well graded; but for the first two or three years in 
school the number of -children in a class should not be more than 
5 or 6. But few schools have yet reached this ideal limit in the size 
of beginning classes. 
ORAL TEACHING AND THE COMBINED SYSTEM. 
The teaching of speech has continued to grow in favor during the 
past year. Of 13,193 pupils under instruction in the United States 
on the 10th of November, 1912, 9,878, or 75 per cent, were taught 
speech; of these, 8,661, or 66 per cent, were taught wholly or chiefly 
by the oral method, while 179, or 1.36 per cent, were taught wholly 
or chiefly by the auricular method. When we remember that the 
first school for the teaching of speech—Miss Harriet B. Rogers’s 
little school of three pupils at Chelmsford, Mass.—was opened only 
47 years ago, and that at that time the entire body of American 
teachers of the deaf regarded oral teaching as a foolish waste of time, 
the progress shown by the above statistics is remarkable. It is due 
to the strong desire of the parents of deaf children that their children 
should speak, to the vigorous propaganda that has been carried on 
by the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to 
the Deaf and other advocates of oral teaching, and to the open- 
mindedness of the heads of schools, but more than all else to the 
increased skill of teachers, and to the remarkable results that have 
actually been achieved through the constantly growing knowledge 
of the physiological basis of speech and the visible movements upon 
which speech reading depends. 
The greater part of the oral teaching in America is not done in the 
exclusively oral schools, but in the schools following the combined 
system. Of the 9,878 pupils who had been taught speech on the 
10th of November, 1912, 6,450, or 65 per cent, were in combined-sys- 
tem schools; of the 8,661 pupils taught wholly or chiefly by the oral 
method, 5,289, or 61 per cent, were in combined-system schools; of 
the 179 taught wholly or chiefly by the auricular method, 127, or 71 
per cent, were in combined-system schools. The oral schools, which 
in the United States include all the day schools but 2, all the private 
schools but 1, and 12 of the 64 public residential schools, endeavor 
to educate all their pupils by the oral method. Some oralists claim 
that all deaf children who are capable of education by any method 
ean be educated by the oral method, although it is conceded that
-P-A-G-E-514
    
460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
there may be a few who by reason of physical defect in their vocal 
or visual organs can not acquire intelligible speech or are unable to 
learn to read the lips. They admit that the success attained is very 
unsatisfactory in some cases, and many oralists favor the use of other 
means of instruction for children with whom only meager results 
can be achieved by the oral method. Thus Mr. F. W. Booth, super- 
intendent of the Nebraska school, a prominent oralist, said in a paper 
read at the conference of superintendents and principals of Ameri- 
can schools for the deaf held at Indianapolis in 1913: 
I am an oralist, but an oralist with no prejudice against the principles of the 
combined system where the system is applied to give really distinctive treat- 
ment and distinctive classes of pupils; where, in short, each and every pupil 
shall have intensive instruction through the one method fitted to give to him 
the best education of which he may be capable. 
The combined-system schools, which include 52 of the 64 public 
residential schools, all the denominational schools and 2 day schoois, 
endeavor to choose for each child the method best suited to his indi- 
vidual capacity. “Fit the method to the child, not the child to 
the method,” is their motto. At the beginning of the course all the 
children are usually placed in oral classes; but after two or three 
years’ trial those with whom the measure of success in speech and 
speech reading is slight are transferred to manual classes, and their 
education is carried on by manual methods, which include the use of 
signs, the manual alphabet, and writing. 
The methods of instruction in the oral classes of combined-system 
schools are identical with those of the oral schools. But outside the 
schoolroom the language of signs and the manual alphabet are em- 
ployed in chapel exercises and public addresses, for which, on ac- 
count of the difficulty and uncertainty in reading the lips of a public 
speaker, they are better adapted than speech; they are also the usual 
means of communication employed by the children in talking with 
one another out of school. In the oral schools, while the children do 
use signs more or less in communicating with one another, this habit 
is repressed as far as possible by those in authority, and the endeavor 
is made to surround the pupils with an oral atmosphere out of school 
as well as in the schoolroom. 
The free use of signs by deaf children has its advantages and its 
disadvantages. On one hand it quickens and broadens the under- 
standing and conveys much general information at a period when 
the language of words is still unknown; it reaches the mind and heart 
even of the educated deaf as no other means can. On the other hand 
its convenience and facility lead the children to continue its use even 
after they have learned to speak and read the lips; they have little 
practice in oral communication outside the schoolroom; the language 
of signs, the vernacular of the congenital deaf-mute, which in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-515
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 461 
combined-system schools has been highly developed as a means of 
communication, tends to become confirmed as their natural medium 
of thought and expression; speech and speech reading, though they 
may be mastered as a hearing student masters a foreign tongue, re- 
main to them something strange, foreign, artificial, an adjunct of the 
schoolroom rather than a spontaneous instrument of human inter- 
course. 
The best application of the principle of the combined system, 
affording the most scientific and most efficient means of instruction 
for the deaf, is probably to be found in Denmark. All the deaf 
children: of that-country are first sent ‘to a preparatory and testing 
school at Fredericia. At the end of the year there is a sifting out 
of those who have considerable hearing, constituting 28.4 per cent 
of the whole number. These are removed to a school at Nyborg 
and are taught orally. Thus only the totally (or almost totally) 
deaf are left at Fredericia, and at the end of the second year these 
are divided into three classes, called “A,” “B,” and “C” classes. 
The A children are the totally deaf of bright intellect, constituting 
25 per cent of the whole number of the deaf. They are taught 
orally at Fredericia, in a school that is separate and distinct from 
the preparatory school above mentioned. The B children are the 
totally deaf of medium mental capacity, constituting 19 per cent. 
They remain in the preparatory school and are taught orally. The 
C children are the totally deaf who are mentally dull, constituting 
27.6 per cent. They are removed to a school in Copenhagen and are 
taught manually. In the larger American schools, some of which 
contain each more pupils than all the schools of Denmark put 
together, it might be desirable to carry the Danish system of 
classification still further, forming an additional class of “ semi- 
mute ” children—those who have acquired verbal language in the 
natural way through the ear before hearing was lost—to be taught 
orally. Thus each class of the deaf would receive the kind of in- 
struction by which it could profit most and each method would do 
its work to the best advantage. Dr. James Kerr Love, an aural 
surgeon of Glasgow, who has made a careful study of the education 
of the deaf in the various countries of Europe and America, says the 
ideal system would consist of “a combination of the Danish classi- 
fication with American thoroughness.” 
While teachers of the deaf still differ concerning methods of 
instruction, the bitterness of feeling on the subject that formerly 
prevailed has passed away. The adherents of either method now 
acknowledge that excellent work is done by the other. In a recent 
article in the American Annals of the Deaf, Miss Sarah Harvey 
Porter, a prominent advocate of the combined system, while declar- 
ing her “strong belief in the judicious use of signs in the class-
-P-A-G-E-516
    462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
room and in their free use outside,” admitted that “a good oral 
school will forever be able to show better lip reading than any com- 
bined-system school can produce.” On the other hand, Dr. A. L. E. 
Crouter, superintendent of the Pennsylvania Institution—the largest 
and one of the best oral schools in the world—and long president of 
the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the 
Deaf, said at the last convention of American instructors of the deaf: 
We freely concede that great good has resulted and will continue to result 
to the deaf from the honest and sincere application of methods that are not 
oral and heartily rejoice in their success. 
If any bitterness of feeling still remains on the part of the edu- 
cated deaf, the great majority of whom, by whatever method they 
have been instructed, are ardent supporters of the combined system, 
it is not because they are opposed to oral teaching, for they are not, 
but because they can not bear to see deaf children deprived of the 
language of signs, from which they themselves have derived so much 
pleasure and profit and which they appreciate as no hearing person 
can. Their attitude is shown by the following resolutions adopted 
by the National Association of the Deaf at a largely attended con- 
vention held at Colorado Springs in 1910 and reiterated at their 
convention in Cleveland in 1913: 
Whereas the sign language, as introduced in America by Clere and developed 
by Gallaudet and other early educators of the deaf, is a most beautiful language, 
of priceless value to the deaf; 
Resolved, That any policy of education which tends to impair or destroy or 
restrict the use of this beautiful language is opposed to the best interests of 
the deaf; 
Resolved, That we call upon schools for the deaf not only to preserve, but to 
improve this sign language, and to give systematic instruction in the proper 
and correct use thereof. 
Whereas, while we fully recognize and appreciate the value of speech to the 
deaf, we also recognize the difficulty and even the impossibility of acquiring it 
by many of the deaf; 
Resolved, That we favor the best oral instruction for those deaf who can 
profit by it. 
Resolved, That where the attempt to acquire speech results in the sacrifice 
of mental development, we favor the employment of such methods as will secure 
the highest mental development. 
That is what the combined system aims to do, and therefore we indorse the 
combined system. 
Whereas speech reading is practicable only for individual conversation, and 
does not enable the deaf to understand sermons, lectures, debates, and the 
like; and 
Whereas the sign language offers the only practicable and satisfactory 
means by which the deaf may understand sermons and lectures, participate in 
debates and discussion, and enjoy mental recreation and culture; 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this convention that ali the deaf, including 
these taught by the oral method, should have the privilege of using the sign 
language while at school.

PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 463 
AURICULAR INSTRUCTION, 
Few persons are totally deaf, and in nearly all the schools for the 
deaf there are some pupils with a considerable residuum of hearing. 
In some schools such pupils are trained by special teachers who en- 
deavor to educate and, by education, develop the existing hearing 
power so that during the latter part of the course the ear may be 
made the principal means of receiving instruction and the pupils 
may be graduated as hard-of-hearing rather than deaf persons. In 
other schools the same end is sought, but with less success, by means 
of such special training as can be given in connection with other 
teaching. 
Not all the pupils in American schools for the deaf who possess 
sufficient hearing are taught through the hearing, partly on account 
of the expense involved in the employment of special teachers and 
the impossibility of giving the requisite time in connection with 
other teaching, and partly because many heads of schools regard the 
development of imperfect hearing as less valuable on the whole than 
the acquisition of good lip reading, and they deem it best to concen- 
trate all the attention upon the latter. The proportion of pupils 
taught wholly or chiefly by the auricular method, however, while 
fluctuating somewhat from year to year, tends gradually to increase. 
Tt has risen from 0.58 per cent in 1902 to 1.36 per cenit in 1912. 
INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
American teachers of the deaf in residential schools have always 
attached great importance to industrial training. By this is meant 
not merely manual training, such as has been introduced within 
recent years into the common schools, but also what is now called 
vocational training. As Dr. Francis D. Clarke said at the conference 
of superintendents and principals held at Indianapolis in 1913: 
The first trades school ever established in America was established in 1823 
at what was then the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb (now the 
American School for the Deaf, at Hartford), and for years the schools for the 
deaf were the only schools that made any effort to teach trades to their pupils. 
The aim of this industrial training is to give every pupil, pari 
passu with the education acquired in the schoolroom, the mastery 
of some trade by which he may secure independent self-support im- 
mediately after graduation. This ideal is not attained in all the 
schools, but in the best residential schools it is. In those that fall 
short of it through insufficient ~pecuniary resources, the pupils at 
least form habits of industry, learn the use of tools, and acquire 
the rudiments of a trade. The discipline of the shop is every- 
where regarded as no less valuable and important than that of the 
schoolroom. To it may be attributed in large measure the general 
   
-P-A-G-E-518
    
464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
independence, thrift, and success in life of the graduates of the resi- 
dential schools. There are very few deaf beggars or paupers in 
America, and deaf people seldom “trade in their misfortune.” In 
nine cases out of ten, persons who appeal to the sympathy of the pub- 
lic by exhibiting written or printed cards saying “I am deaf and 
dumb” are impostors, with unimpaired hearing and speech. It is 
not always easy for the average citizen to detect the fraud, but an 
educated deaf person or a teacher of the deaf can readily do so. 
At the present time the National Association of the Deaf is making 
a vigorous effort to put a stop to these impositions, which bring 
upon the deaf a discredit that is wholly unmerited. 
More than 70 different industries are taught in American schools 
for the deaf. The occupations generally regarded as most desirable 
and which therefore occupy leading places in the curriculum of the 
schools are, for the boys, farming (including dairying, gardening, 
and poultry raising), carpentry and cabinetmaking, shoemaking and 
repairing, printing, tailoring, baking, painting and glazing, masonry, 
chair caning, weaving, barbering, and blacksmithing; for the girls, 
cooking, housework, sewing and mending, dressmaking, embroidery, 
and millinery. Local conditions lead to the introduction of other 
industries. The deaf do not always follow the occupations they have 
learned in school, but where proper care has been exercised in 
choosing the occupation to be taught, and where the pupil has been 
so thoroughly trained that he has become a master of his trade, he 
usually follows it after graduation. In the cases where he does not, 
the habits of industry he has formed and the practice he has had in 
the use of tools enable him to take up a new occupation with com- 
parative ease. 
The proper division of the day’s work between general education 
and industrial training is a subject that has been much discussed 
by the heads of schools for the deaf. In most of the schools five 
hours are given to work in the schoolroom, with one or two hours 
of study in the evening, and two and a half or three hours are given 
to work in the shops. This arrangement, however, does not always 
allow a sufficient length of time to enable the pupil to become a 
master of a trade. In some schools, as the New York, Illinois, and 
Michigan schools, this difficulty is met by keeping the pupils, during 
the latter part of their course, in the shop for four hours and re- 
ducing the school hours to the same length; in other schools, as 
those of New Jersey and Indiana, postgraduate industrial courses 
are provided to which former pupils are admitted and where they 
are given additional training in the shops for eight hours a day. 
Where the circumstances of the school are such as to render a post- 
graduate course feasible, this plan seems preferable to that of abridg- 
ing the school hours during the undergraduate term of instruction; 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
  PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 465 
for deaf pupils as a rule need for their proper mental development 
five hours a day in the schoolroom. 
MONTESSORI TRAINING. 
Teachers of the deaf were among the first to greet the Montessori 
method when it was brought to the attention of the American public 
two years ago. Believing that it might prove helpful in the educa- 
tion of deaf children, several of them went to Rome last year and 
studied the method at first hand in Dr. Montessori’s training class 
during the winter of 1912-13. Two of them—Mrs. A. Reno Margu- 
lies, of New York, who was Dr. Montessori’s assistant in organizing 
the training school in Rome, and Mrs. J. Scott Anderson, of Phila- 
delphia—on their return to America introduced the method into 
their private schools and established Montessori training classes for 
teachers. Mrs. Edwin G. Hurd, wife of the principal of the Rhode 
Island Institute for the Deaf and head teacher of that school, was 
the first actually to apply the Montessori method to the education of 
the deaf. In January, 1913, she began training by this method eight 
little deaf children from 3% to 5 years of age. 
Dr. Montessori, in her Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica, acknow]l- 
edges her great indebtedness to Dr. Séguin and Dr. Itard, who was 
Dr. Séguin’s instructor. Dr. Itard was the resident physician of the 
National Institution for the Deaf in Paris from 1800 to 1838, and 
there made experiments in the education of deaf children, taught 
“the wild boy of Aveyron,” and established the “ classe d’instruction 
complémentaire,” which later gave an impetus to the formation of 
the “high classes ” in American schools for the deaf. Much of the 
Montessori didactic material for the training of the senses has long 
been in use in schools for the deaf, and when the method was first 
acclaimed in the American magazines it was asserted by some teachers 
of the deaf that there was nothing in it that was new to them. Now, 
however, that the method has been more profoundly studied, it has 
become evident that the sense-training material and the technique, to 
which so much prominence was given in the magazine articles, by no 
means constitute the whole of the method. In applying the princi- 
ples of modern psychology to the education of little children, Dr. 
Montessori has shown better than any of her predecessors the natural 
order in which subjects of study should be introduced, and has taught 
us how to train our children from the beginning in habits of self- 
control and respect for the rights of others; she has shown us how to 
develop their initiative, strengthen their will power, and broaden the 
field of their mental activity. 
Mrs. Hurd’s experiments in the application of the Montessori 
method to the education of little deaf children have already been 
17726°—xrp 1913—vor 1——30  
-P-A-G-E-520
  466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
carried far enough to prove that these children respond to the treat- 
ment as eagerly as hearing children and that the effect upon their 
mental and moral development is equally satisfactory. If it should 
be objected that the amount of language they acquired—the element 
of first importance in the education of the deaf—was less than that of 
deaf children who have been under instruction by other methods for 
the same length of time ,it should be remembered that they were 
younger than the usual age of admission into schools for the deaf. It 
is reasonable to expect that after two years of Montessori training 
they will be able to make more rapid progress in language and other 
subjects than pupils of the same age who have not had the benefit of 
that training. 
MUSICAL VIBRATIONS. 
The idea of musical training for the deaf seems absurd at first 
thought, but experience has shown that it is not only possible, but 
useful, Mr. Enoch Henry Currier, principal of the New York Insti- 
tution, who has given much study and experiment to this subject, said 
at the conference of superintendents and principals held last sum- 
mer (1913) that he regarded music as a more important factor in the 
education of deaf children than of hearing children. 
Mr. Currier’s attention was first attracted to the possibility of musi- 
cal training for the deaf by observing that the children in his school 
liked to beat against a wall or other solid with a club. “A boy would 
stand and pound by the half-hour on a brick wall. It was not done 
once or twice, but was an habitual practice.” Inquiring of the children 
why they did that, he was told that the resultant sensations “ gave 
pleasure and enlivened the body.” He concluded that music might be 
used to advantage in stimulating the deaf to greater activity. 
First he introduced the drum as an aid to the military drill, for the 
New York Institution has been organized upon a military basis for 
many years, and its pupils have attained a high degree of excellence 
in drill. He found that the marching and manual of arms improved 
very much when the drummer was “ hurling sound waves against the 
battalion.” Next he added fifes and then bugles, until now he has a 
trained band of between 40 and 50 members composed entirely of 
pupils of the school. In the band are 16 pieces—5 B-flat cornets, 
3 E-flat alto horns, 1 B-flat tenor, 1 B-flat baritone, 2 E-flat basses, 
1 trombone, 1 snare drum, 1 pair of cymbals, and 1 bass drum. The 
repertoire includes 185 selections. The execution of the band is so 
good that it is often invited to participate in high-grade concerts 
given by hearing musicians in New York City. 
The pupils in the New York school “rise in the morning to the 
call of fife and drum; led by the band they march to their meals and 
to school in perfect step and time.” When the band plays they crowd 
 
-P-A-G-E-521
  
         PROGRESS IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 467 
around it just as hearing persons assemble around a body of musical 
performers. They do not hear the nusic in the ordinary meaning 
of the word; they receive no more sensation through the auditory 
apparatus than through other parts of the body; but, as Mr. Cur- 
rier says, their entire system responds to the series of harmonious 
sound waves. He finds that, as the effect of the sound waves— 
the minds of the pupils become more alert; they become more ready to take 
initiative action; they get out from that dormancy which is peculiar to any 
person who lacks the stirring up that comes from the hurling of sound waves 
against him. 
In some other schools for the deaf the piano is used as an aid in 
teaching speech. With their hands resting upon the piano, the pupils 
note the length of vibrations when chords are struck, the volume of 
tone, and, to a certain degree, the relative pitch. Mrs. Sarah A. 
Jordan Monro, a successful trainer of teachers of the deaf in Bos- 
ton, regards the piano as— 
very valuable in leading deaf pupils so to concentrate thought upon vibrations 
and their meaning that the organs of speech are left as free as those of hear- 
ing children, and are thus in a condition for a natural use. Unfettered muscles 
and their unconscious freedom of action thus give to speech the beauty of defi- 
niteness without force and fluency without laxity. 
Under the leadership of Miss Sarah Harvey Porter, an instructor 
in the normal department of Gallaudet College, a society of teachers 
of the deaf was formed last year for the study of the psychological 
effect of musical vibrations upon the deaf. Miss Porter has an inter- 
esting article on this subject in the American Annals of the Deaf for 
March, 1912. 
HIGHER’ EDUCATION, 
The progress in the higher education of the deaf during the past 
year has consisted especially in the broadening of the work of Gal- 
laudet College, a department of the Columbia Institution at Wash- 
ington, D. C., maintained by the Government of the United States, 
which offers the opportunity of higher education to the deaf. In 
addition to its courses in ancient and modern languages, mathe- 
matics, history, and philosophy, which formerly held the leading 
place in the curriculum, the college now offers courses in electricity, 
chemistry, dairying, and stock raising for young men and in library 
work for young women. 
Hitherto the graduates of the college have engaged in teaching 
more largely than in any other occupation, though there have also 
been among them clergymen, architects, artists, editors, civil-service 
employees, and representatives of many other employments of a 
high grade. The new courses will give them special preparation for 
departments of useful work in which deafness is not a handicap, and     
  
-P-A-G-E-522
  468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
in which some graduates of the college have already achieved suc- 
cess, tliough they have not had the advantages of special preparation 
that are now offered. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The training of teachers of the deaf is a problem that has not yet 
been wholly solved. It is essential that such teachers should possess 
all the qualifications of the best common-school teachers, that they 
should have an equally good general preparation, and in addition 
that they should have a special course of training covering a period 
of at least one year; two years is preferable. 
To meet this need in part, and especially with a view to raising the 
standard of men entering the profession, Gallaudet College since 1891 
has offered normal fellowships to hearing young men who are college 
graduates. It has also admitted a few young women, mostly college 
graduates, to its training class. Some excellent teachers have thus 
been brought into the work and they are now filling prominent posi- 
tions in the schools; but it is difficult to induce men of proper qualifi- 
cations to take the course, since the pecuniary compensation of in- 
structors of the deaf is generally so small that capable young men 
with a college education find other lines of work more attractive. 
Many young women are desirous to become teachers of the deaf, but 
even if Gallaudet College were willing to take them instead of young 
men the limited number that it could receive would be insufficient to 
supply the needs of the country. 
The Clarke School, at Northampton, Mass., has a training class of 
high character which is supported in part by the American Asso- 
ciation to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf; it also main- 
tains a summer school for teachers, which has done much to raise the 
standard of instruction. Several other schools for the deaf, both 
public and private, have training classes in connection with their 
regular work; the course offered at the Indiana school, which covers 
a period of two years, is one of the best. By these classes in the 
various schools many good teachers have been trained within recent . 
years, but the supply is still inadequate. 
A new departure in training teachers of the deaf is about to. be 
undertaken in Wisconsin. The legislature of that State, at its session 
of 1913, passed a bill providing for the training of teachers of the 
_ deaf at the Milwaukee State Normal School. Students in this depart- 
ment will receive instruction in methods of teaching the deaf in addi- 
tion to their regular normal training, and their certificates will he 
countersigned so as to permit them to teach either deaf or hearing 
children in the schools of the State.
-P-A-G-E-523
PROGRESS. IN THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 469 
One reason, perhaps the principal reason, for the present insufficient 
supply of competent teachers of the deaf is the inadequacy of the 
compensation generally offered. The work is arduous, it requires 
superior ability, and demands special training; the salaries paid, 
therefore, ought to be larger than they are in the common schools. 
Asa matter of fact they are mot; probably in the past they have not 
been quite as large as in the best common schools. There has, how- 
ever, recently been gratifying improvement in this direction; the 
salaries paid in the State schools for the deaf have been increased, 
on an average, 25 per cent within the past five years.

CHAPTER XXII. 
PROGRESS OF THE EDUCATION OF THE BLIND IN THE 
UNITED STATES IN THE YEAR 1912-13. 
By Epwarp EH. ALLEN, 
Director Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind, Watertown, Mass, 
ConTENTS.—Evidences of progress-—The work of field agents—New buildings and equip- 
ment—Voeational training—New ‘activities in progressive institutions——Day schools 
for blind children—New publications—New plant of the Perkins Institution. 
  EVIDENCES OF PROGRESS. 
The progress of the education of the blind in the United States is 
encouraging; for the year 1912-13 it is particularly so. While the 
campaign for preventing unnecessary blindness in children has grown 
in strength and persistence, and attention to the needs of the adult 
blind has become more effective, public opinion has caused a larger 
proportion of the blind children to go to school and has begun to meet 
' the special needs of “ defective eyesight” cases; curricula have been 
enriched and made more practical, and the scope of the schools has 
been further extended into the lives and careers of their graduates. 
The superintendents, teachers, and workers have united in large and 
enthusiastic biennial and triennial conventions; their former differ- 
ences are disappearing; in short, progress has been noticeable all 
along the line. 
The old idea that we shall always have the blind with us has given 
way to the saner conviction that there are altogether too many of 
them; in other words, that a large proportion are needlessly blind, 
and that this fact is a public responsibility, as well as a disgrace to 
civilization. An increasing number of oculists are gathering data, 
and they and other writers are publishing disagreeable and startling 
facts. But recently public opinion has been influenced mainly 
through the persistent activities of associations and commissions for 
the blind. These have not only published the truth far and wide, 
through lectures, literature, charts of startling significance, moving- 
picture shows, and the like, but they have also caused laws tending 
to the prevention of blindness to be enacted in one State after an- 
other, and they have improved existing laws. They have haled be- 
fore the court and reprimanded or fined a few negligent midwives 
471
-P-A-G-E-526
  472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
and even physicians. And they have aroused boards of health and 
the medical profession generally. The latest proof of progress is 
the invitation to the field agent for the conservation of eyesight of 
the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind to present a paper be- 
fore the American Medical Association at its session in Minneapolis 
in June, 1913. He accepted, his paper being entitled “ Preventable 
Blindness; a Challenge to the Profession.” This paper has appeared 
both in the journal of the association and in the form of reprints for 
general distribution to physicians, social workers, nurses, ete. 
The schools for the blind also have helped in the campaign of en- 
lightenment by furnishing statistics of the causes of blindness of their 
pupils. But in order to insure future help of this kind the American 
Association of Instructors of the Blind voted in 1910 to recommend 
to its membership the keeping of uniform records, and in 1912 the 
association supplied a form of uniform record card. 
THE WORK OF FIELD AGENTS. 
While many children have been saved from blindness through the 
increased effectiveness of the law and the special agencies for “ fol- 
low-up” work, still the attendance upon schools for the blind has 
constantly grown. In 1912 it was 4,821, the largest it has ever been. 
Compulsory attendance laws have not brought about this growth, 
for as yet such laws, while often including the blind, actually affect 
them but little, save in a few places. The real causes of the increase 
are twofold: First, the employment by one institution after another 
of a field officer to search out the blind in their homes and to persuade 
the parents to send them to school; and, second, the increase in num- 
ber, size, and efficiency of day-school centers for the blind in the 
public-school systems of certain cities. While a few southern insti- 
tutions have long increased their pupil attendance through personal 
visitation, the superintendents usually traveling about for the pur- 
pose in the summer vacations, it is only within the past decade that 
the field-officer idea has spread over the country. Most of the insti- 
tutions’ annual or biennial reports for 1911 or 1912 either tell of 
having such an agent or emphasize the need of one. The convic- 
tion prevails, therefore, and is yearly gaining ground, that it is not 
enough to create the schools, but that it is a duty to bring the pupils 
to them; that, lacking any other agency, the school itself must do it. 
In the cities above referred to, special visitors employed by commis- 
sions or associations, or teachers have gone to the homes of blind 
children and have usually been able to cause them to attend the local 
ds 7 school or to secure their admittance to the State institution.
-P-A-G-E-527
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 473 
NEW BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT. 
The institutions for the blind have collectively spent for buildings 
and lasting improvements nearly a quarter of a million dollars 
($248,932) in the school year 1911-12, but the amount spent by one 
institution was $221,403, and a comparatively small sum was so ex- 
pended by the others. It is known, however, that during 1912-13 
much more than this was put into buildings alone; for, besides the 
fact that one, the Perkins Institution, had then finished the many 
buildings of its new plant, several have preferred to add one or more 
separate buildings rather than to enlarge existing structures. This is 
in accordance with the prevailing conviction that the segregate sys- 
tem of housing is superior to the congregate. 
The only new school for the blind opened in 1912 is the Austine 
Institution for the Deaf and the Blind at Brattleboro, Vt. While 
the establishment of a new school indicates progress, the expe- 
rience of the profession is against educating both the deaf and the 
blind under one roof; or, indeed, within the same grounds. The 
two classes and their interests clash to such an extent that, as soon as 
economic conditions permit, they should be put into separate schools. 
VOCATIONAL TRAINING. 
Among the schools for the blind enumerated in the 1911-12 Report 
of the Commissioner of Education are three schools of trades. These 
represent one of the phases of the recent movement for the purely 
vocational instruction and employment of those blind who are above 
school age. About three-fourths of all the blind in any community 
are over 21 years of age, and this is an important movement alike in 
its effect on the serious problem of the adult blind and on the educa- 
tion of blind boys and girls, increasing the emphasis laid on manual 
and vocational teaching in the schools. Other phases, similar in 
purpose, are carried on and extended by private associations and 
State commissions. These organizations labor alike for the conserva- 
tion of vision and for the alleviation of the lot of those who have lost 
sight, their chief means to the latter being the provision of oppor- 
tunities for employment which shall be partly or wholly self-sus- 
taining. The executive secretary of the Ohio commission for the 
blind writes: 
Emphatically the two phases which have been developed in Ohio that are of 
most importance are home teaching with the industrial employment feature and 
the development of nursing service in the care of sore eyes. During the past 
year (1912-18) we have been giving employment to over 250 workers at their 
homes, and the work is proving to be very helpful. 
A necessary part is instruction in handicraft, with provision for 
the manufacture at home or in small shops of goods for which the 
 
-P-A-G-E-528
    
474 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
commission also provides a market or which it sells. Another part 
is the important one of acquainting the public with what is going on 
by means of public and private lectures, working exhibitions at State 
fairs, advertising, and circularizing. Publicity work of the right 
kind is vital in helping to solve the problem, for it helps to create the 
market without which it were mere charity to employ the blind. The 
social-service movement which is now so widespread thus embraces 
the blind as handicapped citizens. The Minnesota School for the 
Blind in 1911 was the first to extend its service to the blind who are 
beyond the usual age of its pupils by opening a summer school to a 
limited number of men. It did the same in 1912 and 1913. 
Most of the superintendents who are now appointed over the schools 
are chosen because of fitness rathe than, as formerly, because of po- 
litical creed. Changes are still too frequent; but it is pleasant and 
encouraging to find that the new man is often primarily an educator. 
The profession is thus filling up with alert young men who under- 
stand the demands of the time and strive to meet them. 
The schools, while still emphasizing the purely cultural studies, as 
they should do, yet carefully balance these with the vocational; and, 
instead of turning the graduate out to shift for himself as best he 
may, more and more of them are helping him to secure work. One 
institution, that in Philadelphia, undertakes to provide continuation 
schooling for a considerable number of pupils in the vocational or 
professional schools of the city and State. Another provides a nor- 
mal course for its advanced music students, having as pupils boys and 
girls who can see—the kind of pupils the blind teachers must depend 
upon for their living in order to succeed. Business courses, includ- 
ing commercial arithmetic, bookkeeping, typewriting, salesmanship, 
are now to be found in the curricula of many of the schools. One 
school has recently introduced cobbling, another metal working, three 
or four gardening with vocational aspect. The “ Outdoor Employ- 
ment,” pictured in the last report of the Connecticut Institute at 
Hartford, is unique. At least seven schools are teaching poultry 
keeping in a simple way; in one case, the institution at Pittsburgh, 
the boys with their teacher constructed a first-class hen house. At 
a round-table meeting of instructors in piano tuning, held during the 
convention of 1912, the discussion showed it to be the duty of schools 
for the blind to include a course in the tuning and care of piano- 
players. Immediately four schools responded by doing so. Domestic 
science is taught in 10 or more institutions, no fewer than five of 
them requiring of their girls daily household duties. Household arts 
education has been defined as that form of vocational education 
which fits for nonwage-earning occupations connected with the house- 
hold, and as such it is especially adapted to blind girls, most of whom 
are expected to fit themselves while at school for what they can
-P-A-G-E-529
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 475 
contribute to the home. In at least two residential schools, the beau- 
tiful new cottage school at Baltimore being the first, the boys also 
perform daily household tasks. This is required of all, chiefly because 
it is well for a child to feel himself paying something, if only a lit- 
tle, toward his board and schooling. In 1912, in the latest school to 
be rehabilitated, a domestic science cottage was added to the equip- 
ment, where every girl may have the opportunity to live for a time 
and to learn both the theory and the practice of household economy. 
NEW ACTIVITIES IN PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTIONS. 
All these things go hand in hand with the quickening influence 
of dancing, roller skating, shower baths, swimming pools, outdoor- 
play apparatus, supervised sports, competitive athletics, boy scouts, 
camp-fire girls, talks on personal hygiene, etc. Some of the insti- 
tutions have recently introduced most of these activities—a few 
nearly all of them. Who shall say, then, that the institutions for 
the blind in 1912 are not in a healthful, hopeful, state? In 1912 
and 1913 three expert observers made a tour taking in nearly half 
of them. They report a splendid spirit nearly everywhere, and un- 
questionably the most hopeful tone where most is done both in voca- 
tional guidance and in securing positions for pupils as they leave 
school. One school in particular, that at Philadelphia, now employs 
an agent for the sole purpose of placing the blind in remunerative 
work. His success is one of the most encouraging signs of the times 
in the education of the blind. As a direct result of his efforts in 
1910-11 and a part of 1912, 63 blind people, most of them recent 
pupils of the school, earned $8,895. 
DAY SCHOOLS FOR BLIND CHILDREN. 
Nearly everybody in the profession is sympathetically interested 
in the comparatively new movement for teaching blind boys and 
girls in the public schools. Chicago began it in 1900, and by 1912-13 
10 other cities followed. No less than 404 pupils are reported in 
attendance. They recite in the same classes with the seeing children 
of the school and, it is claimed, with mutual benefit. But their prep- 
aration is always made under the care and direction of special 
teachers. Where a city conducts several “ centers ” for blind children 
there is a supervisor who trains the special teachers, visits every grade 
in which a blind child recites, and sees to it’ that all the blind children 
have manual and physical training and some little music. The extra 
expense of this day school instruction of the blind is in some cases 
wholly met by the city; in others, partly by the State. The per 
capita cost is naturally less than that in the residential schools. 
The day school has the advantage over the residential school

that it does not disregard the home as a factor in the child’s 
life nor remove him during growth from his natural environment, 
and it gathers in the children whose parents are unwilling to send 
them away from home. On the other hand, no public-school system 
can alone provide the balanced opportunities and the inspiration 
that come from nine months spent every year at a well-equipped 
institution. However, this may be, where there is a will there is a 
way. We read of splendid cooperation in 1912-13 between private 
associations and public schools for the blind, of the medical clinics 
provided by the New York association, of its gathering the children 
together week day mornings in summer for “ vacation classes” and 
on Saturday mornings in term time for gymnastic games and calis- 
thenics, for lessons in boy scouting and in the duties of camp-fire 
girls, for talks on personal hygiene, for music, for manual training 
and vocational training, in cooking, sloyd, basketry, rush seating, 
and the like. We hear of blind high-school boys in Milwaukee sell- 
ing newspapers every evening from 4 o’clock to 6.30, “ just like other 
boys,” and of the success of graduate girls as masseuses. Supt. 
Pearse, of the Milwaukee public schools, traveled to Pittsburgh in 
the summer of 1912 to tell the American Association of Instructors 
of the Blind, in convention assembled, of how admirably the needs 
of blind children were met in his city public-schools system. No 
previous executive committee of the association had secured such a 
manifestation of cooperation. 
In 1912, too, the “Department of Justice of the United States 
granted the various day schools for the blind their free quota of books 
from the American Printing House for the Blind.” It is clear, then, 
both that these nonresidential schools for the blind have passed the 
experimental stage and that the movement for them is destined to 
grow broader and larger. Even in Germany the compulsory school- 
ing law does not actually force the parent to send his blind child to 
an institution. But it is even more vital for the handicapped child 
to be educated than it is for the unhandicapped; so then, if all blind 
children are to be brought under schooling in the United States, 
must not more and more public schools be open to them? It would 
seem so. This means that residential and day schools will supple- 
ment each other, for both are necessary to accomplish the greatest 
good. 
In 1912-13 the Boston -school committee established a day school 
for children who see too little to remain in the regular grades and too 
much to progress normally in schools for the blind. Similar centers 
for myopic children have been successfully conducted in London for 
several years and would seem to be needed in most cities. This year 
the Massachusetts Legislature made appropriation for a study of the 
needs of all cases of defective eyesight.

PROGRESS OF EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. ATT 
The training of children under school age is carried on in four 
nurseries for blind babies, and a Minnesota law of 1913 authorizes 
provision for the care and education of blind infants. No attempt, 
however, at special provision for the feeble-minded blind children 
has yet been made in our country. Nor has systematic provision for 
the higher education of the blind been made. However, three States 
appear to have made it possible for blind students at some school 
of higher education to meet the expense of having a reader. Two of 
these, California and Ohio, have established such “ reading scholar- 
ships ” within the past year. 
NEW PUBLICATIONS. 
Books in embossed type are published by the American Printing 
House for the Blind, at Louisville, Ky., and by the printing depart- 
ments of 12 residential and day schools, and by one denominational 
society. In 1912-13 the number of different books issued was 69. 
Every school which can afford it has its printing vlant, and prints 
books, maps, examination papers, etc., as the school department re- 
quires. Five State libraries and 31 free public city libraries main- 
tain departments of embossed books. These, with the 44 school 
libraries, furnish abundant instruction and relaxation to many thou- 
sands of readers. Eight periodicals in raised type are issued; the 
Matilda Ziegler Magazine alone issues 7,000 copies every month. In 
the year 1912-13 the circulation of books and periodicals from four 
libraries alone is known to have been 57,769. The mails carry such 
books free of postage. No country does more for readers who are 
blind. 
Of the many systems of embossed types that have been devised to 
facilitate finger reading, it is pleasant to know that in but two do 
new books still appear in the United States. But even two is one too 
many. Still further encouragement comes from the fact that a so- 
called uniform type committee of blind people, appointed by the 
American Association of Workers for the Blind, has been diligently 
at work for several years, making tests at most of the schools and 
workshops of the country, and that in 1913 they made a report which, 
because of its evident fairness, has gained almost universal support. 
The year 1912-13 has thus seen substantial progress made toward the 
evolution of a best type for general adoption. 
The work for the blind has had for the past seven years a splendid 
quarterly magazine, The Outlook for the Blind. This serves as an 
organ of intercommunication and of inspiration and is a means of 
uniting all activities for and by the blind. It makes the work less 
provincial by putting its readers in touch with the best things at 
home and abroad and by printing a complete list of valuable articles
-P-A-G-E-532
    
  A478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
and books on the subject; and it helps to keep that work in the public 
eye, for it has a considerable circulation among those who see. 
NEW PLANT OF THE PERKINS INSTITUTION, 
The academic year just closed has seen the completion of the new 
buildings of the Perkins Institution and the removal of that famous 
school into them. They comprise what is believed to be the most 
complete equipment for a residential school for the blind that exists, 
embodying, as they do, the ideas gathered during many years from 
most of the institutions and schools in this country and from some 
in Europe. Abroad all such schools are more or less hampered by 
lack of money. The theory on which this plant was reconstructed 
and a description of its features may be had from the following 
extract from the director’s report for 1912: 
It is wise alike for economic and eugenic reasons to educate blind boys and 
girls strictly apart at all times and places. To keep the two groups apart is 
wise for the reason also that the division breaks an unwieldy number into 
groups which may be handled. A further division into cottages is best because 
it effects the maximum of personal contact of the children and youth with 
selected adults. Making each cottage of boys or of girls a family is especially 
desirable and wholesome. The doing of daily chores by all pupils can be made 
to have a profound educational effect; besides, it is practical training for life. 
Some one has said that school is not merely preparation for life, it is life; that 
it should teach boys and girls, not subjects; and that one of the best means is ~ 
to keep them busy and interested and full of responsibility. Officers and teach- 
ers should also have daily “duties,” such as caring for their rooms, the chief 
object being to show to the pupils that housework is honorable and dignified and 
that its avoidance is not one of the results of education. But it is good also 
because it promotes the spirit of family interdependence. 
Such division into cooperative family living is practical only where the 
children are old enough to be really helpful. Where they are not so, as in the 
lower school, the divisions may be by age as well as sex. Where they are so, 
as in the upper school, the element of age may be disregarded, the divisions be- 
ing made to provide equally for the families. This has been the case in our 
girls’ cottages since 1870. . 
The principle which the Perkins Institution is now able to emphasize through- 
out is that the test of education lies less in what one knows than in how one 
can adjust oneself to society; that, while it is easy to instruct the young blind, 
it is difficult to train them so as to hold their own in the world. A reason for 
this difficulty lies in the tendency of the seeing to underrate the capabilities of 
the blind; another, in the natural proneness of the blind to magnify this 
“ prejudice of the seeing” and to minimize the influence of their own exertions 
in overcoming it. The Perkins Institution must be a living, working demon- 
stration of the power of the young blind not only to do this, but also to appear 
and act like other people—really a continuous exhibition. To this end the best 
interdependent family living under reasonably good conditions is fundamental. 
The following is a brief description of the Perkins Institution, at Watertown:
-P-A-G-E-533
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 479 
THE NEW PERKINS INSTITUTION AT WATERTOWN, MASS. 
Site.—It is 54 miles from Boston city hall; 3 miles from Harvard University ; 
within 6 miles of four other colleges; easily accessible by steam or trolley; 
within 10 minutes’ walk of a flourishing village center and several churches. 
Fronts for 1,600 feet on the north side of the Charles River Basin and the 
Metropolitan Park System. 
Has 34 acres of land, an old estate, diversified with shade trees, orchards, 
gardens, playgrounds, and a pond. 
Buildings.—The conditions offered gave the architect an excellent opportunity 
to satisfy requirements of health, practicalness, and wxsthetic grouping. 
Character of buildings.—Fireproof, low, narrow, yet relieved with gables and 
bays, affording maximum of light and air. Practically all living and sleeping 
rooms haye southern exposure. Brick, with slate roof; Tudor Gothic style; 
wholesomely simple and yet beautiful in lines and coloring. Cartouches sig- 
nificant in the history of education of the blind are introduced. There is a 
lofty central tower and belfry. 
Grouping—Two main divisions, a lower and an upper school, each complete 
and independent, except for a common tunnel connection with power house and 
service building. 
1. Lower school (2 kindergartens and 2 primary schools) : Four independent 
families, each with its own dining room, kitchen, play cloisters, ete., and with 
its own set of classrooms—all under one roof, inclosing a great court, 155 by 
120 feet. Each family has its own matron and teachers. 
2. Upper school: Nine cottages in two groups, separated by the main, or 
school and administration, building. Four families and a domestic-science 
house for the girls; four families for the boys. 
Separate buildings are: A little hospital, containing four separate suites, each 
with its kitchenette; also dentist’s and oculist’s rooms. A power house and 
service building, containing boiler, generating, and refrigerating rooms, store- 
rooms, bakery, laundry; kitchen, dining room, and quarters for 10 men; rooms 
for the Howe Memorial Press. Director’s private residence, 
The main building is constructed about two hollow squares, forming a girls’ 
and a boys’ quadrangle. The north and south axis building, between the 
courts, is a museum of teaching objects. In this axis are also an assembly 
room and a swimming pool, and across it, at the southern end, a gymnasium 
with roof rink. There is a great hall for public entertainment, dramatics, and 
dancing; an equally large library; ample rooms for music library, music teach- 
ing, and practice, and for piano tuning; and all the needed classrooms for 
girls’ school and boys’ school and for their manual training. 
The cottages of the girls (like those of the boys) are under one roof and 
make three sides of a rectangular “close,” 270 by 60 feet. From its center 
runs a 20-foot brick walk, connecting with the main building. 
A cottage family is a unit and consists of a matron, 4 teachers, a helper 
who cooks, half the time of a second helper, and 20 girls or boys of grammar 
and high-school age. The house is complete, with kitchen, dining room, living 
room, shower bathrooms, etc. No dormitory, but the small room plan, every 
room having a sunny exposure. 
All buildings are planned to be easily kept in order, as far as possible by 
the pupils themselves, the example being set by teachers and officers, all of 
whom personally care for their own rooms. The floors are mainly of battle- 
ship linoleum, cemented down and bounded by rounded or hospital base. Some 
floors are tiled, some are “ Puritan.” The dadoes are of painted burlap; the 
doors, flush panel; the windows, outward-opening casements. While everything
-P-A-G-E-534

is simple, it is yet beautiful. The ‘institution aspect” is absent; instead there 
is the pleasant atmosphere of home, in which everyone has his part to perform. 
Object of the Perkins Institution—The training of blind boys and girls to 
live lives of happiness and efficiency, both in the institution and in the world. 
Hence it must be— 
A. A laboratory in which there shall be plenty of hard work and play and the 
maximum of personal service from pupils and staff alike; and 
B. A place attractive to all—first, to those who live and labor there, and, 
second, to visitors—to the public who must be the future emp‘oyers of the 
graduates. 
The new Perkins Institution was not built for more pupils, but for better 
service to all. Its location and the character of its buildings have put it in 
the public eye. Interested visitors and students of special education and social 
work are welcome at any time.

RECENT PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN.

ContENTS.—The first juvenile-court law—The increased scope of juvenile court work—Mothers’ pension 
laws—The judge’s personality is the essential consideration—The probation officer—State probation 
commissions—Detention homes—Court procedure—Institutions for delinquents —Relation of feeble-

THE FIRST JUVENILE-COURT LAW. 
The progress of the past year in the methods of dealing with way- 
ward children has been a general approach toward recognized stand- 
ards rather than a marked departure from former approved methods. 
One community follows the lead of another. For this reason, and 
because recent progress can be understood only in connection with the 
conditions from which it came, it is appropriate to outline the present 
accepted methods of dealing with delinquents, tracing briefly their 
growth and indicating the present line of development. 
The present movement began with the passage of the first juvenile- 
court act in Illinois in 1899. That act has given direction to all 
subsequent legislation pertaining to children. In the late nineties 
the conditions to which delinquent and dependent children were 
subjected in institutions in Chicago and throughout Illinois generally 
were probably as bad as any in the country. This was due to the 
city’s congestion and to the lack of ameliorating conditions which 
prevailed in other populous communities of the State. The situation 
was brought to the attention of the Chicago Bar Association in October, 
1898, and a committee was appointed to investigate conditions and 
formulate remedial legislation. Its chairman, Hon. Harvey Hurd, 
called to his assistance a subcommittee of active child-welfare workers. 
Dr. Hastings H. Hart, now of the Russell Sage Foundation, was 
chosen secretary of this subcommittee, and to him was assigned the 
duty of drafting the bill. 
Knowing how hard it is to engraft a new idea upon legislation, he, 
with his coworkers, searched the statutes for established legal usages 
which could be enlarged to meet the situation. The laws of Massachu- 
17726°—ep 1913—vor 1—81 481
-P-A-G-E-536
  482 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
setts and New York were especially suggestive. There were found 
provisions making it unlawful to restrain children in prison in com- 
pany with adults or to try them at the same time. Either before or 
after conviction children might be placed in charge of institutions 
willing to receive them; after trial they might be placed on probation. 
In the civil courts generally, where property rights were involved, 
a person was presumed not to have capacity to act under 21 years of 
age, but in the criminal courts children were held to full responsibility 
at 7 years. Some States had raised the age of criminal responsibility 
to 10 years, and this suggested the possibility of raising it to 16 years. 
Natural parents desire the reformation of their erring children; 
punishment is incidental. Why should the State’s purpose be differ- 
ent? The State is the parent of the unfortunate and helpless, so 
chancery courts had long held. It was a simple step to extend the 
doctrine of parens patriz to include the erring as well as the unfor- 
tunate children. This possessed the incidental advantage of removing 
the children entirely from the police court atmosphere. A precedent 
was found in a provision which had been for a quarter of a century 
in the laws of several States to the effect that incorrigible or truant 
children might be brought into a probate or surrogate court charged 
with being delinquent and, if so found, committed to a reformatory. 
This obviated the necessity for jury trials, for it was not a criminal 
procedure. It also offered a way to escape formidable indictments 
in which children were charged with crimes in antiquated sixteenth 
century phraseology which only a portion of the lawyers understood 
a part of the time. Instead, the charge was made that the child was 
delinquent, which means merely bad. 
And as children had guardians for their property, it was proposed 
to provide a guardian for their morals, and a probation officer was 
suggested, not to prosecute, but to represent the interests of the 
child. To prevent the courts from killing the purpose of the act 
by strict interpretation, it was deemed necessary to add that it be 
liberally construed, so that the care, custody, and discipline of the 
children of the State shall approximate, as nearly as may be, that 
which should be given by their parents. 
The bill thus drawn became a law April 21, 1899. It marked a 
new era in criminal procedure. Its essential features and phraseol- 
ogy are now incorporated in the laws of 44 States and the District 
of Columbia and of many foreign nations. 
THE INCREASED SCOPE OF JUVENILE COURT WORK. 
The tendency has been to broaden the scope of juvenile court 
work. In various jurisdictions the age limit has been raised to 17, 
18, 19, and even to 21 years. It soon became apparent that, to 
remedy delinquency and neglect, the custodians of children must
-P-A-G-E-537
  
PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 483 
be dealt with. Therefore, juvenile courts were given authority to 
enter orders as to discipline or control or support; that is, to pre- 
scribe the course of treatment and to enforce these orders, as courts 
of equity do, by imprisonment for noncompliance. 
In 1903 Colorado created a new crime by providing that whoever 
shall be responsible for, or contribute to, a child’s delinquency shall 
be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than 
¥ $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Similar 
provisions with various penalties have been: widely adopted. One 
statute has made it a crime to indulge in conduct tending to lead a 
child into delinquency. This was because formerly there had to be 
delinquency before there could be contributing to delinquency; one 
can not contribute to a thing that does not exist (84th O. S., 366). 
As an example of the application of this law, it enables the juvenile 
court to punish a man who sends an innocent child into a gambling 
house. If the child did not know the character of the place, it would 
be unjust to hold him delinquent. So, under the old law, the person 
who sent him would escape on a charge of contributing. Some 
States have extended the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts to 
include all crimes against children. Where imprisonment is a pos- 
sible penalty for contributing to delinquency a jury trial is a constitu- 
tional right. 
MOTHERS’ PENSION LAWS. 
In an attempt to prevent rather than cure delinquency 20 States 
have, within the past two years, enacted laws making it possible 
to assist from the public treasury indigent mothers who, without 
this help, would be compelled either to surrender the custody of 
their children or leave them without proper care. In most of the 
States this assistance is granted on the order of the juvenile court. 
Much discussion has been awakened as to the advisability of such 
legislation, but those in charge of or familiar with the work of the 
juvenile courts generally favor it. It seems that no general rules 
can be laid down, the advisability of such legislation depending 
entirely upon local conditions. Where the situation is adequately 
met by existing agencies, or where such agencies, with new authority, 
can properly do the work, such laws are unnecessary. But where 
relief of this character has been inadequate, or existing public agents 
are inefficient, mothers’ pension laws offer an opportunity for a new 
set of officials with a new spirit to teach efficiency and bolster up 
the public relief systems. In Cook County, Ill, where this system 
has been longest in operation, the work has been so systematized 
as to be a pattern for other localities. Under a recent law this 
character of relief is limited to mothers who are citizens of the 
United States and have been residents of Cook County for three  
-P-A-G-E-538
  484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
years and are proper persons physically, mentally, and morally to 
care for their children, but who are unable of themselves to provide 
properly and are without relatives of sufficient means and ability to 
support them.’ 
The applicant for such a pension must sign a statement, which is 
verified. She is then visited by a district probation officer, who 
reports all visits to the head of the department. When the investi- 
gation is complete, if it is felt that there is a chance of the court’s _ 
granting funds, the supervisor of the department, who is a trained 
dietitian, estimates the minimum budget for the family. These 
facts are then presented by the probation officer to a conference 
committee composed of members of the juvenile court staff. If 
they think the relief should be granted, an investigator of the county 
agent’s office is notified, and he makes a separate investigation. If 
his findings agree with those of the conference committee, the mother 
and children are summoned to juvenile court and the judges passes 
on the case. Systematic supervision is made of the families to 
whom funds have been granted, and special conferences are fre- 
quently held by those engaged in this department. The work of 
the field supervisors is vastly different from the work of the ordinary 
probation officer, and specially trained people are needed to do 
effective service. 
Since July 1, 1911, when the first Illinois law went into effect, 
pensions have been granted to about 600 families in Cook County. 
Of the 1,700 children in these families, only 1 has been brought into 
court for delinquency and 2 for truancy. The Chicago authorities 
attribute this remarkable record to the careful supervision given 
these families by the probation officers. 
THE JUDGE’S PERSONALITY IS THE ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATION. 
Good laws do not make efficient government. The laws creating 
and empowering a court are important, but the chief consideration 
is good administration. The first requisite is a good judge, because 
his spirit will dominate the whole institution. He can strengthen 
every force in the community which is working for good, or he can 
throw all the social machinery out of gear. This statement needs no 
argument in communities which have been unfortunate in this regard. 
Very many well-educated people have no social intelligence. They 
may have lived all their lives in their limited environment and have 
no knowledge of the way in which the ‘great majority of people 
struggle. Many such people have never talked to a criminal and 
have never known a person suffering from distressing poverty. How 
could a lawyer bred in such an atmosphere appreciate or understand 
the problems of the poor? It very frequently happens that lawyers
-P-A-G-E-539
PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 485 
of profound learning have little knowledge of the human affairs that 
arise in a juvenile court. So the selection of the judge is all important. 
In most places the juvenile court jurisdiction has been conferred 
on courts already established, and in such cases the judges have 
either set aside part of their time for work with children or have 
designated one of their number to devote his time exclusively to 
this work. In the larger centers of population the latter practice 
has been the rule. In some places the terms of service in the juvenile 
court branch have been long, while in others the judges have rotated 
every one, two, or three months. In some places. special courts 
have been created, the judges of which devote all. of their time. to 
this kind of work. Some of these judges are appointed, as in the 
District of Columbia and the State of Massachusetts; while in others 
they are elected, as in Denver, Colo. None of these systems is free 
from difficulty. Ncne is proof against poor selections... Perhaps the 
worst system is that where the judges rotate every few months. 
Many of the judges look upon the work of this branch of their court 
as mere drudgery and take no interest in it. They regret leaving 
the other branches of the court in which the business is conducted 
with great decorum by wise lawyers, to face the heterogeneous mass 
in the juvenile branch. A short term does not permit a judge to 
know the children or the families with which he must deal, nor the 
agencies through which he must work. The careful investigations, 
well-considered recommendations, and devoted work of the various 
social agencies of a community can relieve a judge of many worrying 
details and of much of his responsibility; but a judge who serves 
but a month or two can not become properly acquainted with his 
own assistants. The court is not the sole reforming agency in a com- 
munity. It is rather the place where the child is brought into con- 
tact with the social agencies which seek to work his redemption. It 
is important that a judge know not only the agencies and the character 
of their work, but the personalities of the various officers. 
The choice of the judges in Chicago has been uniformly wise. 
There the jurisdiction was placed in the circuit court, which is a court 
with chancery powers. The judges have designated one of their 
number to preside in the juvenile court, and the terms of service 
of those so chosen have covered a period of years. 
In Ohio the jurisdiction over children has been placed in a number 
of important courts such as the common pleas, probate, superior, and 
insolvency courts. The judges of these courts in the various counties 
meet and designate one of their number to exercise juvenile court 
jurisdiction. Many of the judges of these courts have no liking for 
this kind of work and recognize their unfitness for it, but among their 
number one is usually found qualified by education, disposition, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-540
      486 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
willingness to perform these duties, and.whose training fits him to 
undertake the administrative side of the work. 
In California the jurisdiction is in county courts, and in the popu- 
lous counties the judges are designated as in Chicago. Opposition to 
some of the judges recently developed in several places, which, how- 
ever, was not strong enough to force their retirement. Thereupon 
the legislature was induced to pass an act making, mandatory a 
change of judges once a year. The law will probably fail» of its 
purpose because of an informality; if it stands, it will probably be 
destructive of good administration. 
It is advisable that juvenile court jurisdiction be county wide, so 
that the occasional cases which occur in rural communities will be cer- 
tain to receive expert attention. Difficulties arise in counties in which 
there are: large municipalities other than the county seats. This 
can be met by appointing in those cities resident probation officers 
and giving them broad powers to conduct preliminary hearings, their 
authority being akin to that of masters appointed in civil cases to take 
testimony and make findings of fact, or of commissioners appointed 
by Federal judges to conduct preliminary hearings in criminal cases. 
THE PROBATION OFFICER. 
Probation work is an essential part of the juvenile court scheme; 
consequently the provision for probation officers is quite general. 
Probation grew out of a system, long common in criminal courts, of 
suspending sentence; that is, of postponing execution of the sentence 
during good behavior. Courts frequently requested relatives, public 
authorities, or charity workers to take special interest in persons so 
convicted and sentenced, and to report to the court, from time to 
time, their progress and manner of behavior. In the later seventies 
a probation officer under pay of the community was appointed in 
Boston, whose duty it was to have under supervision all persons thus 
released after conviction. As previously stated, this system was 
incorporated into the juvenile court idea, and under the administra- 
tion of the best juvenile courts it has come to have an entirely new 
meaning. A child on probation is a charge of the court, and through 
its officers the various forces in the community are brought to bear 
in a helpful way upon him. It is an active, instructive, educational 
force, requiring trained and experienced workers. Probation work, 
if poorly done, can be worse than useless, but, if well done, it is the 
most constructive force for reformation. In most places probation 
officers are appointed by the judge, but this is far from universal. 
In some places they are paid out of public funds; in others, by local 
societies, religious or social; and in still others the work is entirely 
voluntary. In some places one system works best, and in others 
another. There is absolutely no doubt that the best results are     
-P-A-G-E-541
PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 487 
obtained from paid probation officers if they are wisely selected. 
Probation is a public function as much as school teaching, and should 
be paid for from the public treasury. It is work that should be 
consistently and regularly done by persons who make it their sole 
work. In the larger centers a number of probation officers are neces- 
sary, and their work should be supervised by a chief. For instance, 
Cook County, Ill. (including Chicago), has 76 paid probation officers— 
62 women and 14 men. There are in addition 46 police officers de- 
tailed to juvenile-court duty who work directly under the judge. 
They are under a sergeant, whose office adjoins that of the probation 
officers. This is the best scheme yet devised to insure harmonious 
cooperation between police and probation officers. It works well. 
It is essential that close harmony shall exist between probation officers 
and the judge. Of course, where the judges change every month or 
so this harmony can not exist, for the judge scarcely knows the proba- 
tion officers before he passes on to other duties. Where the judge 
serves for a longer time, in order to secure harmony and to have the 
administrative branch of the work all responsible to one individual, 
it is probably wise that he have the appointing power. But inasmuch 
as so many judges have fallen short in this respect, failing apparently 
to grasp the meaning and importance of it all, it is probably wise that 
his selections be limited to a civil-service list. The civil-service 
examinations, however, should be conducted by people of long ex- 
perience in social work, for they well know that character, disposition, 
and personality are the chief factors in probation work. In some 
places where civil-service rules prevail the appointing authority has 
been compelled to select from immature men and women who could 
pass good paper examinations but lacked the wisdom which age and 
experience bring. 
Where the work can be divided, so that different kinds of duties are 
assigned to the various officers, a young man could sometimes be 
intrusted to look after older boys, but ordinarily it is not safe nor wise 
to intrust a person under 25 years of age with the duty of solving 
human problems and advising people in their home and marital rela- 
tions. While, therefore, the answers to written questions on social 
problems and methods should form a portion of every civil-service 
examination for probation officers, the determining factors should be 
personality and temperament. A judge should have great liberty 
in selecting from a list so prepared. The selection should be made 
to meet his present needs. He must consider many factors. He 
may need, to round out his force, a nurse or a doctor or a person who 
speaks a particular language. In large cities which have a large per- 
centage of foreign-born residents this becomes important, and often 
the determining factor, because no matter what an officer’s qualifi- 
cations for social work, they avail little if he is not able to talk to his 
~ charges.

STATE- PROBATION COMMISSIONS, 
Several States, in an effort to standardize probation work, have 
established State probation commissions which bear to the local 
officers about the same relation that State boards of charity do to 
charitable institutions. Their duties are to inspect and suggest; 
they are not charged with the responsibilities of administration. 
Such State commissions have demonstrated their value. Once 
established, they become permanent. Executive officers visit the 
various courts, counsel the local officers, tell them of their weaknesses, 
tell of the experiences of others and suggest improvements. Meet- 
ings of probation officers are held in various parts of the State, where 
their problems are discussed and their methods analyzed. Good 
results follow. 
DETENTION HOMES. 
Probably without exception the juvenile-court laws of the country 
make it illegal to. detain children under a certain age (generally 12 
or 14 years) in jails or places where adult persons are confined. In 
very many communities no regard is paid to this law, and no pro- 
vision is made for the detention of juveniles; in others are found de- 
tention homes elaborately planned and expensively maintained with 
every convenience and equipment that could be desired. Some 
places maintain ‘‘homes”’ which had better be abolished. It is 
better to detain children in well-conducted jails than in poorly man- 
aged detention homes. Here, as in every other institution dealing 
with human beings, the first consideration is the personalelement. It 
requires brains to conduct a detention home. No amount of equip- 
ment will make up for bad management or low ideals. The constant 
aim from the moment the child enters until he leaves should be to 
make him better physically, mentally, and spiritually. 
Good equipment is always an aid, and certain requirements seem 
fundamental. The general surroundings should be wholesome; the 
house well lighted, ventilated, and heated, and so constructed that 
it can easily be kept clean and sanitary. Boys and girls should be 
entirely separated. This is important; and there should be such 
further separation of the various classes as to insure against moral 
contamination. Convenient arrangements must be at hand for 
bathing the children and for washing and disinfecting their clothing. 
A doctor within easy reach should be called at the first sign of trouble, 
to prevent sickness and epidemics. In large cities daily visits are 
necessary. The food should be plain, but well cooked and nourish- 
ing. If the children are kept busy, their minds filled with whole- 
some thoughts, and their bodies regularly exercised, discipline will 
largely take care of itself. Regular school hours are a great help 
to the children and a relief to the officers in charge. The short  
-P-A-G-E-543
  
PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 489 
period of detention is for many children a critical time, and impres- 
sions will be lasting. By a wise selection of teachers all possible 
chances of blundering treatment can be eliminated. If a good 
reader of child nature, such a teacher can be of great help to a court. 
The superintendent also has a splendid opportunity to study the 
children and should make detailed reports of her observations. Many 
courts ignore entirely this splendid opportunity of obtaining infor- 
mation. 
The employees of the home should be appointed by the same 
authority that appoints probation officers, so that friction can be 
instantly eliminated. Women should have exclusive charge of girls, 
and ordinarily their services are preferable in the care of boys, ex- 
cepting the older ones who are hardened in wrongdoing. Boys thus 
confined often have deep trouble in their hearts and need mothering. 
Many of these requirements may be met even in rural communi- 
ties where arrests are rare; and they should be insisted upon. De- 
sirable results can often be obtained by an agreement between local 
authorities and some good woman, the wife, perhaps, of a farmer or 
a county official, who is willing to set aside a room or so in her resi- 
dence for this purpose. That this method is entirely feasible is 
proved by the fact that so large a city as Boston has no detention 
home, but uses instead the boarding homes suggested by the aid 
society. 
COURT PROCEDURE. 
Comparatively few of the children brought before the court are 
held in detention before trial. It occurs, as a rule, only when they 
have no homes, or very bad homes; or when the arresting officer 
believes, because of the seriousness of the offense or the character of 
the child or his people, that he will not report when wanted at court. 
All persons having authority to make arrests, or their immediate 
superiors, should have power to release a child on a promise to 
appear in court when summoned. 
Most of the complaints which come to court should be settled by 
the probation officer either in his office or in the very place where 
the difficulty arises. In this way about nine-tenths of the neigh- 
borhood quarrels over children’s shortcomings should be hushed up. 
The basis of all formal complaints is a petition. In Ohio, under 
a recent amendment (August 13, 1913), a bare allegation of delin- 
quency is sufficient, but in most places this is followed with a de- 
scription of the particular acts complained of. A summons then 
issues ordering the parents to produce the child at the time fixed for 
the trial. The next move is an investigation. Many cee no practi- 
cal objection to serving the summons by the probation officer who 
makes the investigation. It certainly saves great duplication of
-P-A-G-E-544
  
490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
effort and incidently of expense. The investigation should develop 
facts which will assist.the court in reaching a conclusion; facts which 
throw light on the delinquent’s character and environment; that 
show why he is bad and suggest the saving forces which can be brought 
to bear upon his life. When it is apparent that the offense is not 
serious or of an accidental nature, that the boy is normal and the 
home good, a long inquiry into family affairs is in bad taste. Under 
different circumstances such facts might be most material and 
necessary. 
The setting of the court scene should be made a means to the 
desired end. While the trial should not be secret, all unnecessary 
publicity should be avoided. Neither children nor parents should 
be humiliated by having their shortcomings paraded before a gallery 
of onlookers. The room, therefore, need not be large; and no chairs 
need be provided for visitors. The child should be near and on a 
level with the judge. A table is preferable to a bench. The simpler 
the furniture the better. Very frequently, however, the trials are 
conducted formally in regular courtrooms with an elevated and cano- 
pied bench, with seats filled with visitors, and other children await- 
ing trial, It would be an unusual child who could be himself under 
these conditions. Administering an oath is well calculated to make 
a child ill at ease and is therefore worse than useless. Some courts, 
following the letter of the old law rather than the spirit of the new, 
find a child guilty or not guilty, regarding what he has done as of 
more importance than what he is. In all courts the particular act 
which caused the complaint is generally the first matter to receive 
attention. A short cut to the point is advisable. “Well, son, why 
are you here?” generally brings a confession which, with a word of 
explanation from the complaining witness, clears up that issue. 
The real question is: Is he so delinquent as to need the State’s 
care? That inquiry involves his moral, mental, and physical condi- 
tion, as well as the character of home and neighborhood. The pre- 
liminary investigation of the probation officer should furnish this 
information and can be verified by the judge’s questions. The feel- 
ing is general that girls’ cases should be handled exclusively by 
women, and that a woman probation officer should invariably be 
present in court to represent the interests of the delinquent girls. 
Some go to the extent of advocating women judges. In Chicago the 
judge has, since March 1, 1913, delegated a woman probation officer 
to act in such cases in his stead. This woman assistant judge hears 
all cases in private, then makes her recommendation to the judge, 
who, without inquiry as to the facts, confirms her findings in a 
formal order. For this procedure there is no warrant in law. Those 
interested in such cases are advised of this informality, but never 
object, preferring this procedure to a hearing in open court.
-P-A-G-E-545
PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 491 
Having determined the facts, the court can, under the law, use as 
a remedy any reform agency in the community. Generally speak- 
ing, two classes of remedies are open: Probation in some of its forms 
or institutional care. The first has been treated as extensively as 
the limits of this article will permit. It implies the employment of 
an efficiency expert to devise the best methods of driving evil from 
the child’s life and to bring to bear on him every possible beneficent 
influence. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR DELINQUENTS. 
The work of caring for delinquent youths in institutions has been 
standardized, largely through the conferences on the education of 
backward, truant, delinquent, and dependent children. Each year 
sees new ideas emphasized, but in general recent progress has come 
through bringing the various schools up to the recognized standard 
rather than through the introduction of new methods and ideas. 
The best methods are generally agreed upon. In no line of philan- 
thropic endeavor is the unevenness of progress better illustrated. 
On January 1, 1825, the New York City House of Refuge formally 
opened its doors. It was the first governmental reformatory for 
criminal youth. Within a few years five other cities followed. These 
were walled institutions. The Raus Haus, at Born, near Hamburg, 
Germany, established in 1833, was the first application of the cottage, 
or family, plan. France followed with the Colony de Metre. In 
1855 Goy. Chase, of Ohio, sent a commission to Europe to study these 
two institutions, and the result was the Boys’ Industrial School, at 
Lancaster, Ohio, the first institution in the country established on 
the cottage plan. A year later a school for delinquent girls was 
established on the same plan at Lancaster, Mass. Despite the long 
time intervening, there are still States, among them some of the 
oldest, which have no reformatories or industrial schools and con- 
tinue at this late day to imprison child offenders in penitentiaries. 
Fortunately their number is very small. 
Of late years several cities, among them some of medium size, 
have established schools for delinquents on the family plan in the 
country. Pittsburgh last year opened such a school. Cincinnati is 
at present reorganizing her House of Refuge on this basis. A like 
movement is in progress in St. Louis. Some of these institutions 
are primarily for truants and are under the management of the school 
authorities. In every city of any size there should be, and generally 
is, a “boys’ school’ to which boys from all districts should be 
assigned when it becomes apparent that their influence is detrimental 
in the regular schools. In most cases they should be allowed to go 
home at night. In one city a dormitory with about 15 beds is part 
of the equipment. The janitor and his wife live in the building. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-546
  492 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
few days’ detention here at the expense of the parents often has a 
salutary effect upon both the truant and his family. 
There are throughout the country a large number of places of cor- 
rection established by benevolent and religious societies. Such 
institutions have some choice as to the kind of delinquents they will 
accept, and can therefore adopt methods and policies that are not 
safe and practical in a public institution which must take under its 
care all delinquents within certain ages, no matter how bad they 
may be. 
The principles on which reformatories maintained at public ex- 
pense should be conducted are fairly well established. They should 
be in the country, on large tracts of tillable land. A poorly chosen 
site is an everlasting drawback. Institutions for the two sexes 
should be separate. The cottage or family plan is preferable. It 
affords a better and more natural method of living, and enables the 
physical equipment to grow with the school’s needs. The dormitory 
plan is best for boys, except in honor cottages. Girls should have 
separate rooms. Individual beds are a prime requisite. Many 
schools do not provide enough dormitory watchmen. This is poor 
economy. If there are more than 25 in a cottage, family life disap- 
pears, and each cottage becomes an institution. If the number is 
25 or less, there should be separate dining rooms in each cottage. 
Around a common family board many of the primary virtues are 
cultivated. A common kitchen counts for economy of time, effort, 
and money, and it relieves from drugdery and gives family officers 
time and opportunity to devote to their charges. Simple dishes can 
be prepared in the cottage kitchens. Fireless cookers on wheels 
afford a satisfactory means of transporting food. In girls’ cottages 
the kitchen arrangements can be more elaborate to afford practice 
in domestic science. The Russell Sage Foundation has issued a 
book covering the requirements of cottages for such schools. 
Honor cottages are maintained in many of the best schools, and 
here the greatest possible freedom is allowed. Frequently such 
cottages are made self-governing, copying the spirit of the George 
Junior Republic. 
A number of small institutions is preferable to one large one. 
This makes possible segregation of the various classes of delinquents. 
They can be divided as to age, mental capacity, degree of delin- 
quency, etc. No school should be so large that its general officers 
can not carry in mind the characteristics of its various pupils. 
Commitments to such institutions should be indeterminate, espe- 
cially within the limits of the ages within which they can do effective 
work. 
Every child should be carefully examined upon entrance, and his 
physical defects should be remedied as far as possible. After his
-P-A-G-E-547
  PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN, 493 
mental traits have been observed and determined by the best-known 
methods, a course of treatment and training meeting his needs and 
capacity should be followed, and the system of education in school 
and shop should be broad and elastic enough to meet these needs, 
The work of creating and maintaining the physical property of such 
a school affords the best of opportunities for vocational training, 
for relating teaching to real life, and for making learning interesting. 
Much of the waste product of regular schools finds its way into 
industrial schools and reformatories. Naturally, the best industrial 
school superintendents and educators early recognized that activity, 
the actual doing of things, the practical application of learning to 
something right at hand in which the child was interested, was the 
best way to hold-this type of mind; that the child who could not meet 
the hard and fast requirements of the curriculum which led vp to a 
classical education was not necessarily waste product. In the best 
schools of this kind the time of the pupils is divided between school 
work, industrial work, and recreation; and the three are related so 
that the child’s interest in the one is carried over into the others, and 
his whole life thus woven into his education. Many’a child has 
found for the first time in the industrial school a kind of teaching 
elastic enough to meet his needs. 
The rules of most industrial schools provide that its inmates may, 
upon the recommendation of the superintendent, be released on 
parole, but in the legal custody and under the control of the insti- 
tution. Most schools have too few parole officers. The superin- 
tendent should have authority also to place his charges in foster 
homes and to pay board. 
Of most importance is the superintendent, for he gives to the insti- 
tutions its spirit, and the only results worth striving for are spiritual. 
He must plan wisely for farm, cottage, school, officers, and inmates, 
and must execute as well as he plans. He must have a pleasing 
personality and moral and spiritual power. He must have enthusi- 
asm. Such men are rare. Reformatories have been, and to some 
extent are, the footballs of politics. This made it difficult to secure 
good men for industrial school work. But of recent years our laws 
have been putting such institutions under nonpartisan or bipartisan 
boards, and protecting their officers by civil service, thus insuring 
permanency of management, making impossible some of the terrible 
disasters of the not distant past. This is a wonderful gain. It stays 
the hand of the executive, who in ignorance would rob an institution 
of its very soul. About the hardest help to find are good family 
officers, but the right kind of a superintendent will find them if he 
can guarantee immunity from political interference. 
Of course, training schools for girls should have women in charge. 
In one State, Ohio, this has been impossible under constitutional
-P-A-G-E-548
  494 “ EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
requirement that all State officers be electors, but that provision was 
changed at the November (1913) election. 
Industrial school authorities have never lost sight of the purpose 
for which these institutions were established—the making of good 
citizens. Some other schools place more emphasis on scholarship 
than on character. 
RELATION OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS TO DELINQUENCY. 
It is apparent that the foregoing methods of treating wayward 
children by court and industiial school are developed from long 
experience, and it is certain that these methods will be modified 
and improved as more intensive study is given to various phases of 
the work. In fact, such a modification is now in. process owing to 
the great fund of information concerning feeble-mindedness which 
has recently become available, largely through the writings and 
teaching of the authorities at the training school at Vineland, N. J. 
It is the relation of feeble-mindedness to delinquency and the treat- 
ment of the defective delinquent which are relevant here. 
It has long been recognized that industrial schools contained an 
unusually large percentage of defectives, but no one correctly esti- 
mated the extent of it until the Binet-Simon scale came into general 
use. This is the most satisfactory intelligence test yet devised for 
those whose mental power is below that of a normal child of 12 years. 
A person is classed as ‘‘feeble-minded”’ when his intellect is so unde- 
veloped or impaired that he is incapable of competing on equal terms 
with his normal fellows or managing himself or his affairs with ordi- 
nary prudence. There are three classes: Idiots, imbeciles, and 
morons, the latter term having been chosen to characterize those 
whose intelligence can be developed to equal children of 8 to 12 
years. Subnormals whose intelligence exceeds this limit are called 
backward rather than feeble-minded. 
In the past five years many tests have been made in public schools, 
as well as in industrial schools and reformatories. Less than 3 per 
cent of public school children are feeble-minded, and about 15 per 
cent are backward. In schools for delinquents the percentage of 
normal youths is very small; of backward youths, very large; while 
from 25 to 50 per cent are feeble-minded. The difference in the per- 
cent of the last-named is chiefly due to the methods of parole. 
Where the feeble-minded are kept longer than normal children, the 
percentage is of course high. 
Backwardness is often cured when due to physical causes, such as 
defective sight or hearing, oral or nasal trouble, anemia or sickness 
generally; but the feeble mind can not be cured. The term means 
lack of mind, and it is impossible to supply what does not exist.
-P-A-G-E-549
  
PROGRESS iN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 495 
Defective children are not naturally bad. They are apt to become 
bad because too much is expected of them. Their conduct is often 
a blind protest against an order of things they can not comprehend. 
Again, they are easily led. The percentage of illegitimate births 
among feeble-minded girls is very large, probably twice as large as 
among normal women. 
On the other hand, most feeble-minded youths under proper custo- 
dial supervision are well-behaved, easily managed, and happy. 
Many can be taught simple tasks. As a rule, morons are willing 
workers and can often be made self-supporting. Add the further 
fact that about 70 per cent of feeble-mindedness is inherited, and it 
becomes apparent that a radical change must be made in the method 
of treatment of this unfortunate class. 
The best way to care for the defective delinquent is to prevent his 
propagation. This involves either sterilization or permanent custo- 
dial care. The first is at present impracticable, if forno other reason 
than that it is not sustained by public sentiment. Although author- 
ized in five States, it is seldom done. The second is, by the best 
authorities, considered, for the present at least, the better method. 
It is estimated that the number of feeble-minded in the country 
exceeds 200,000. Of these about two-thirds are at large; approxi- 
mately 40 per cent of the remainder are in prisons and reformatories. 
The others are in almshouses and institutions especially designed for 
the care of this class. Such institutions are maintained in 25 States. 
When segregation is accomplished, the problem of the defective 
delinquent is largely solved. In the meantime what should be the 
working policy of (1) institutions for delinquents; (2) juvenile courts. 
(1) Every such institution should have its children tested by 
expert examiners. Their capacity once determined, the various 
classes should be segregated. This is now done in several places. 
At the Lancaster (Mass.) School for Girls the cottage farthest re- 
moved from the general group is set aside for the most defective 
pupils. This segregation benefits the brighter children as well as 
the defective, because the two classes require different kinds of 
‘treatment. Some of the defective girls are given rudimentary 
education; some are incapable of even that. All are trained in 
simple industries and have kind and watchful care. As opportunity 
offers, girls are transferred to the school for feeble-minded. This is 
a fine illustration of cooperation between institutions. The ideal 
arrangement is a separate institution. Dr. Hastings H. Hart, in an 
article on ‘‘The Extinction of the Defective Delinquent,” suggests 
that the children’s homes which have been closed in some States 
because of the modern system of home-placing be devoted to this 
use.
-P-A-G-E-550
  496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
(2) Juvenile courts should have the means of detecting the 
feeble-minded. If psychological tests are made in the schools, dis- 
covery is made easy. It often appears in the report of the probation 
officer that the child attends a school for defectives. Pertinent facts 
of this nature are often revealed by the parents, if they have been 
approached in the proper manner. However, too much credit 
should not be given to the statements of parents that their children’s 
shortcomings are due to head injuries received in infancy. The 
safest method of detecting deficiency is the Binet-Simon test. 
Every court of any importance should make arrangements for its use. 
The best disposition for delinquent defectives is permanent custodial 
care. In almost all the States which maintain institutions for the 
feeble-minded, children are received or discharged at the request of 
the parents, who are sometimes blinded by love or swayed by selfish- 
ness, or lack judgment. Consequently, their action is often contrary 
to the best interest of their children as well as of society. The first 
aim should be to give to institutions for feeble-minded permanent 
control, like institutions for the insane. Under most juvenile-court 
laws the judge has the right to commit such children permanently and 
without the consent of parents. The power is not exercised as often 
as it should be. If, as is generally the case, the institutions for the 
feeble-minded are not large enough to meet the demands of the com- 
munity, it is the duty of the judge to select for commitment those 
who are most dangerous to society. First among these is the girl of 
child-bearing age. According to Dr. Goddard, of Vineland, feeble- 
minded women are three times as likely to marry as feeble-minded 
men. They are, too, the objects of pursuit by licentious men, while 
no normal woman is physically attracted by a feeble-minded man.   
EXAMPLES OF ADVANCED LEGISLATION. 
The State of New Jersey is making most extensive plans for the care 
of its mental defectives whereby they will be discovered in early 
childhood and effectively cared for through life at the least possible 
expense to the State. . 
About 1 person in every 500 is afflicted with epilepsy. Dr. Healy 
has carefully studied over 1,000 repeaters who have passed through 
the juvenile court inChicago. He finds that 7} per cent are epileptics. 
He concludes that persons afflicted with this trouble are peculiarly 
susceptible to many forms of moral deterioration and that the welfare 
of society demands their segregation. 
Of late years several courts have been able to command the services 
of physicians and psychologists who are able to make intensive studies 
of cases referred to them. Such studies frequently reveal conditions, 
mental, moral, physical, or environmental, which the judge in the 
rush of business would overlook, but when known they become the
-P-A-G-E-551
  
PROGRESS IN TRAINING DELINQUENT CHILDREN. 497 
basis of intelligent treatment and discipline. To meet the need for 
this kind of enlightened service as well as to standardize and unify 
the work of 88 juvenile court judges, the legislature of Ohio provided 
(Apr. 22, 1913) that— 
all minors who, in the judgment of the juvenile court, require State institutional care 
and guardianship shall be wards of the State and shall be committed to the care and 
custody of the Ohio Board of Administration, which board thereupon becomes vested 
with the sole and exclusive guardianship of such minors. 
This board is then to maintain a ‘Bureau of Juvenile Research” 
and employ competent persons to have charge thereof and make in- 
vestigations as to mental, physical, and other conditions, and there- 
upon base recommendations for future maintenance, custody, and 
treatment. The board shall then assign the child to a suitable State 
institution or place it in a family under proper regulations, and the 
board is authorized to transfer it from time to time as its interests may 
demand. It is further empowered to receive children for observation 
from any public institution. Similar legislation is in contemplation 
elsewhere. In December, 1911, at a joint meeting of the New York 
Probation Commission with kindred organizations, it was resolved: 
That it be recommended that State custodial institutions be established, one for 
males and one for females, for the treatment of feeble-minded persons convicted of 
crime, together with some form of preliminary institution to serve as a testing house 
in order to determine if persons charged with crime are or are not mentally defective. 
Mention should be made of another notable act of the Ohio Legis- 
lature, popularly known as the “Children’s code.” The laws of that 
State pertaining to children were in a sad state of confusion. Some 
were antiquated, some meaningless; some, excellent in themselves, 
were to the general mass unrelated or conflicting. To remedy this, 
under an act of 1911, a commission was appointed to codify these laws 
and suggest amendments. The commission was composed of two 
men of legal learning and social sense. They studied the laws of the 
various States pertaining to juvenile courts, reformatories, industrial 
schools, public schools, children’s homes, institutions for defectives, 
child labor, etc.; they adopted those features best suited to the local 
needs, presenting the same to the legislature in the form of a bill, which 
passed April 28, 1913, almost without amendment. It is the most 
advanced legislation of its kind. If there is to be-a code of evidence, 
of commercial paper, and of insurance laws, why not a children’s code ? 
The confusion which existed in the Ohio laws is common to most of 
the States. It is hoped that her example will be emulated.

I, INTRODUCTION. 
Even a partial survey of the field of activities in teacher training 
in the United States reveals a bewildering series of distinguishable 
activities which may be said to aim at raising the standard of pro- 
fessional service in the public-school system. It is the purpose of 
this account to make a rough classification of the persisting older 
movements and the newly instituted movements which look toward 
furnishing some definite pedagogical equipment for this work. 
There are various agencies and organizations whose teacher- 
training functions may be fairly differentiated. First, there are the 
private institutions with special equipment, endowment, and organi- 
zation for independent administration, and unrestricted fields of 
teaching and investigation, such as Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity, and the School of Education, University of Chicago. Then 
come State universities with their peculiar responsibilities and some- 
what restricted, but more clearly defined, fields of service. Private col- 
leges, because of their relations to the public schools and in many cases 
official relations to State systems of education, have also a vital work 
to do in this same field. Normal schools by virtue of their very 
existence are primarily if not exclusively concerned with this one 
professional problem. State departments, in the present central- 
izing tendencies in State systems of education, are increasingly 
assuming and securing authority in setting standard qualifications 
for teachers, and are also putting forth corresponding effort in various 
ways to see that efficient service consistent with such standards is 
rendered by these ‘‘approved”’ teachers. City school systems are 
more than ever before setting systematically about the work of 
training teachers, and are furnishing to other groups of professional 
pedagogical workers new points of view as to essential principles and 
methods to be observed in this business of training teachers. The 
whole institution of the summer school—including in this class of 
professional work (for it is mainly for teachers) the summer sessions 
of universities, colleges, and normal schools, and sectional or con- 
solidated long-term summer institutes, the county institutes, the 
city institutes, and the high-school summer schools—has assumed 
proportions in the work of teacher-training whose importance and 
499

possibilities have not been as yet fully realized or appreciated. The 
movement looking toward the more general establishment of 
genuine normal-training curriculums in public high schools has 
become one of critical importance to the immediate development of 
such schools and to secondary education generally. Still other 
organizations are affecting in measurable ways the progress of teacher- 
training, if we could sense or roughly estimate the summation of 
influences which various reading circles, teachers’ associations, and 
other corporate expressions of the teachers’ professional consciousness 
are exerting. 
No merely quantitative or statistical account—even if it were 
available—would adequately represent the momentum and extent 
of this professional work for teachers. This report will contain a 
quantitative account of what in the movement lends itself to such 
treatment. With this will be offered, necessarily, some interpreta- 
tion of these figures and some citation of specific instances of signi- 
ficant or novel advance. 
The data upon which most of this account is based were secured 
through letters of inquiry. Different sorts of letters were addressed 
to those in charge of many of the agencies of teacher training, some 
definite questions were put, and a general request was made for 
reports of any other important items of progress. The replies are 
all individually valuable, but difficult to summarize in any fashion 
which will do justice to the variety of ideas and conceptions of the 
nature of the work which they contain. Because of this personal 
equation in interpretation, several replies will be quoted in full. It 
should be kept in mind that these selected replies also serve to suggest 
how complex our problem really is and how pei at present 
most of the pioneer movements are. 
The first plan of this report, to exclude from consideration all 
accounts of significant progress which did not fall strictly within the 
year just passed, had to be abandoned. Many projects of great 
interest and importance, in addition to these initiated and completed 
within the year, are merely continuing well, others are culminating, 
and still others have been abandoned during this period. For these 
reasons the survey is broader than a survey of one year’s develop- 
ments. It can not, however, pretend to be exhaustive, nor to have 
placed the emphasis properly in each case. 
A large field of teacher-training is by common consent assigned to 
the university and college, namely, that of research, extended experi- 
mental and comparative studies, and the technical preparation of 
those looking toward professorships in college departments of edu- 
cation, in normal schools, and departmentalized teaching in high 
schools, or to superintendencies. Few college or university heads yet 
view the field clearly. They in most cases make concessions to some 
sort of vague outside pressure and even encourage developments, 
although they formulate no constructive program and initiate no 
distinct and effective type of organization to do this teacher-training

work. The latter step is as essential as any correct academic or 
scholarly theory of the professional equipment of teachers. This 
administrative problem will be discussed later on. 
The college professor of education has become a factor in our educa- 
tional development to reckon with. He has ceased merely to derive 
trite maxims from an academic philosophy; he reaches out into 
various related fields, psychological, sociologic, economic, or indus- 
trial, as the case may be, and actually makes various new depart- 
ments of study; he steadies himself in his emancipated position as 
coordinate in rank with older academic and professional colleagues, 
evolving his method and educational philosophy in accordance with 
new social, industrial, and political conditions; he recruits his teach- 
ing ranks with men who are of the constructive research order; he 
plans ahead how to help his intending students to orient themselves in 
the labyrinths of the general college curriculums planned yet with no 
reference to intending teachers; he meets the schoolman in the school- 
room and handles without gloves the dusty problems of that atmos- 
phere. Often his problems are so new that in any particular field he 
can exhaust his knowledge and the available literature in a one-hour 
course. His material is still somewhat unsystematized; his nomen- 
clature is confusing; his courses overlap and are not so easily stand- 
ardized for ‘‘transfer of credits” as those in Latin or mathematics. 
Some of his colleagues still think of him as an alien. He himself, 
however, is for the most part so immersed in his own problems, fasci- 
nating and urgent, as to be immune both to intimations of his real 
importance and to the attitude of his academic colleague who has 
ample time for leisurely surveillance of a neighbor’s doings. 
An examination of all the available university and college cata- 
logues for the past two years furnished data for the following tabular 
presentation of the variety of matters bearing somewhat directly on 
the instructional program of the schools or departments of education. 
Table I shows the differentiations of fields and of courses, and the 
varieties of exploitation of new fields, as well as some adaptation to 
local conditions and to the individual penchants of the professors in 
charge of the work. Teachers College, Columbia University, and the 
School of Education, of Chicago University, are not represented in 
the table, for they are in many ways in a class by themselves and are 
to be considered separately. . 
EXPLANATION OF TABLE I. 
This table is the result partly of interpretation of courses. For instance: Child 
psychology, genetic psychology, and psychology of education are conveniently 
included under educational psychology. Religious education is listed under moral, 
not because it is regarded as identical with, but most closely allied to, moral education. 
Courses on defective children are grouped under abnormal psychology. Wherever 
the relationship of courses does not seem as close as the foregoing, but still indicates 
some general kinship, the name of the course is stated in the column more nearly its 
own. The column “Other topics” includes general courses as well as those which 
can not reasonably be grouped under other heads.

    » 506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
This rapid multiplication of educational courses has resulted in an 
unfortunately confusing nomenclature for courses. There does not 
seem to be a sharp differentiation between many of these courses. 
This often results in injustice to students who transfer from one school 
to another. Courses differently titled appear to be quite similar in 
content. 
This confusion in part, with the varying practice with reference to 
‘(minimal essentials” as introductory courses, reflects a difference of 
opinion as to what really constitutes teacher training. It is quite 
evident that courses in education should be, in many cases at least, 
as specific as those in law or medicine. A glance at Table I reveals 
the fact that the only approach to a constant offered is ‘‘history of 
education,” and this can not be judged a constant if such schools as 
the University of Chicago are included. Here history of education 
is not required. State boards of education, in the requirements for 
professional examinations, show the same lack of uniformity. The 
varying emphasis placed on courses may be due to several causes. 
Among these is the lack of equipment in the school itself, including 
the lack of preparation of the instructors in charge, and also the 
insufficiency of teachers. But other partial causes lie deeper than 
those just named. 
Is there any fundamental difference between ‘‘principles of educa- 
tion,” ‘‘philosophy of education,” and the ‘‘psychology of education,” 
as they are often actually given? These titles designate overlapping 
courses. In fact, the philosophy of education is still vaguely described 
everywhere. There is no textbook, apparently, that adequately rep- 
»resents what this course should include. Some schools treat prin- 
ciples of education as an elementary, introductory course; others as 
one whose prerequisites should be history of education and educa- 
tional psychology. Each defines its own courses. Each State has 
its own requirements, with even the statutes specifying the same in 
terms which are not definite. A cooperative effort should be made 
to determine what is essential and what may serve as simply electives 
for undergraduates in similar groups, what as prerequisite for entrance 
to later graduate work, and what as merely cultural work for those 
who do not intend to teach, but who as laymen and citizens need some 
understanding of educational principles and administration. 
Table I shows that our universities are responding to the increasing 
demand for more efficient teachers. There is not only a general 
increase in courses, but there is a more thoroughly trained and selected 
teaching body giving these courses. The number of professors with 
the doctor’s degree indicates more highly specialized work. This is 
evident in the number of seminars offered and in the greater oppor- 
tunities for research. See Table IT.
-P-A-G-E-561
  PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 507 
Tables Land II also reveal a general tendency to raise the standard 
of teaching. The tables do not show, of course, how efficiently these 
courses are taught, but from the descriptions of the courses one senses 
the advent of the expert and sees evidence of genuine curriculum 
thinking. i 
The tables are also significant in what they do not record.. There 
are no courses in textbook making, only a few courses on the science 
and art of study, only a few courses on moral education or religious 
education, or in educational statistics, or as yet in either industrial 
education. or in higher education. Four institutions report courses 
offered in the administration and methods of higher education for 
those definitely preparing for work, administrative or instructional, 
in normal schools, colleges, and universities. (For typical contents 
for such a course see Ed. Rev., Nov., 1913, p. 390 ff.) It should be 
noted that the rate of increase in research in education and in number 
of doctorates conferred exceeds that in any other field of graduate 
study. There are only a few courses in experimental education. 
The technique of teaching—that is, the art of developing lessons in 
class—is not treated adequately in the secondary subjects. Special 
methods are taught by college men in charge of these particular 
departments, but this does not guarantee that an effective technique 
of teaching is offered. There is a noted recent increase in the number 
of courses in secondary education, with in many cases a fairly thor- 
oughgoing differentiation of courses in that field. i 
In addition to the catalogue study of the teacher-training, a general 
letter was sent to professors of education in universities anda num- 
ber of the smaller colleges requesting information concerning changes 
in general policy or advanced steps in administration which have 
occurred recently, especially during the year 1912. There was:a 
further request for accounts of developments contemplated for the 
near future. With this was inclosed a list of topics indicative of the 
kind of information sought, it being made clear that the list was not 
comprehensive. 
The list follows (items 1-6 inclusive), with other items added which 
were furnished by those representing the colleges and universities 
who replied to our questionnaire: 
1. Steps taken looking toward making the work of the professional training of 
teachers coordinate administratively with other professional work of university grade, 
such as engineering, medicine, or law. 
2. Instances of cooperation in the teacher-training work by other college forces, as, 
for example, medical schools (medical inspection), agricultural departments, library 
staffs, department of physical education, etc. 
8. Which of the following activities are under the administrative control of the 
department or school of education? 
(a) Teacher’s courses in special subjects given by other departments. 
(6) Physical education for teachers.
-P-A-G-E-562
  508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
(c) Recommendation of teachers for positions. 
(d) Inspection of State schools. 
(€) Extension work for teachers in service. 
(f) Field work, using city schools as laboratories for advanced students, etc. 
(9) High-school conferences held on grounds. 
(h) Summer schools. 
(i) Education surveys. 
(j) Technological departments (manual training, domestic science, public-school 
music, etc.). 
(k) Graduate work in education. 
4. Special requirements for the master’s or doctor’s degree in education, differing 
from requirements for degrees in other branches of study; for example, demonstrated 
teaching ability, personal traits, moral force, general culture, etc. 
5. Changes in entrance requirements to courses in education. 
6. Changes in number of hours or in specific subjects as requirements for teachers’ 
certificates or diplomas. 
7. Practice schools. 
8. School clinic. 
9. Measurements of efficiency. 
10. New buildings. 
11. Affiliation with city schools. 
12. Degrees in education. 
13. Special short curriculums. 
14. Follow State board standards in teachers’ certificates or diplomas? 
15. Double standard for granting teaching certificates or diplomas? 
16. Addition of new courses. 
Fairly detailed replies were received from 67 institutions. For 
purposes of comment and interpretation we may group the institu- 
tions heard from into three classes: A, special universities; B, State 
universities; C, the smaller colleges. It will be noted that some of 
the questions relating to administrative problems refer chiefly to the 
institutions in classes A and B. Most of the items, however, are 
significant and pertinent for all. The following Tables II and IIT 
contain the list of institutions and show roughly the information 
classified and attributed to proper institutions. Some institutions 
not reporting upon the chart items in most cases reported other 
interesting activities. Reports on items 7 to 16 merely show recent 
happenings or make incidental mention. There are many practice 
schools and institutions granting degrees, for example, not shown in 
the table.

Before generalizing from these totals secured from such a variety 
of different institutions some discussion of the particularly significant 
classes should be emphasized. 
Il, TEACHERS’ COLLEGES IN ENDOWED INSTITUTIONS. 
The teacher-training .work of the institutions styled ‘Special 
universities, group A,” differs in character, scope, and method of 
administration from the work of either of the other groups. 
The following replies from Teachers College and the School of 
Education of the University of Chicago are of sufficient general 
importance to be quoted in full. It will be seen from these typical, 
but unusually clear, responses to our inquiry that some arbitrary 
interpretation of answers and comments must be made in order to 
condense into a statistical summary the main features of the data 
obtained from all the higher institutions. 
Teachers College, Columbia University—The account of the work 
and proposed changes at Teachers College contains items answering 
the questionnaire seriatim, especially the policy of markedly raising 
the admission standards, the significance of which for progress in 
teacher training will be readily appreciated: 
(1) The work of Teachers College is already coordinated administratively with the 
other professional schools of Columbia University. Since its connection with Colum- 
bia University, Teachers College has ranked as a professional school, taking the same 
place in the university system as the schools of law, medicine, and applied science. 
(2) By the organization outlined in paragraph one, Teachers College has its own 
faculty, the members of which devote their exclusive time to instruction relating to 
the training of teachers, supervisors, superintendents, and college and normal school 
professors of education. 
(3) (a), (), (¢); each of these items is under the control of Teachers College. 
(d) Not controlled by Teachers College. 
(e) Work in extension teaching is controlled by a separate department of the uni- 
versity organized for that purpose. 
(f) Not under control of Teachers College. 
(g) There are frequent educational meetings at Teachers College, which include 
high-school associations of teachers. : 
(h) Teachers College has its summer school offering organized as an integral part of 
itswork. Practically all of the faculty of the summer session is selected from the regu- 
lar faculty of the college. 
(i) The members of the faculty of Teachers College often take part in education 
surveys, but such work can not be said to be under the control of this institution. 
(j) Teachers College has under its control regular departments devoted to instruc- 
tion in household arts, industrial arts, school music, fine arts, physical education, 
and nursing and health. 
(k) Graduate work in education is in charge of the school of education of Teachers 
College. 
(4) The requirements for the master’s and doctor’s degrees for candidates specializ- 
ing in education are outlined fully on pages 24-27 of the announcement of the school 
of education of Teachers College for 1913-14. 
(5) Teachers College, in its school of education, has recently made marked changes 
initsrequirements for admission to be ineffectaiter July 1,1914. The presentrequire-
-P-A-G-E-569
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 515 
ments for admission are outlined on page 28 of the announcement of the school of 
education. The new requirements for admission after July 1, 1914, are outlined on 
page 29 of the announcement. 
By these changes it will be seen that the school of education of Teachers College 
will become a graduate school after July 1, 1914, so far as preparation is concerned for 
teaching in secondary schools such academic subjects as English, history, Latin, 
French, German, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or geography. After 
July 1, 1914, the school of education of Teachers College will receive as students 
majoring in these subjects only those who hold the bachelor’s degree from an approved 
institution. This means that after July 1, 1914, all students received with a major 
in these subjects will matriculate for the master’s or doctor’s degree and diploma. 
The demands of the secondary schools throughout the country for increased prepara- 
tion have made this new regulation necessary. 
The school of education will continue, as heretofore, to receive candidates for the 
bachelor’s degree specializing in elementary or kindergarten education, or in the 
teaching of household, industrial, or fine arts. After July 1, 1914, candidates for the 
bachelor’s degree specializing in elementary or kindergarten education must offer for 
admission a record of at least two years of successiul experience in teaching in addition 
to the requirements for admission now in force,    
   
School of education, University of Chicago.—The report communi- 
cated from the University of Chicago is likewise illuminating and 
furnishes also in a concise statement another adequate and very 
important account of the work of teacher training which is represent- 
ative of the best in the country. 
Tnasmuch as there was a radical reconstruction in the administration of many 
aspects of our work from 1909-1911 immediately after Mr. Judd became director of the 
school of education, there have been relatively few large modifications since. Some 
of the significant points in Mr. Judd’s administration are the following: 
1. For graduate work in the department of education, a prerequisite of two courses 
in education and one course in a related science was established. The master’s 
essay has been made essentially a piece of minor research, objective in character and 
involving the use of three types of technique, namely, experimental, statistical, or 
historical. 
2. For undergraduate students in the college of education the prevailing require- 
ments of psychology and history of education were abolished and required courses 
in the principles of education and general methods substituted. These courses are 
taught by instructors who are versed in psychology and bring in as much of this sub- 
ject as is needed for explanatory purpose: 
8. As far as the history of education is taught, emphasis is placed upon the history 
‘of the development of school practice and organization in relation to changing social 
conditions. Special emphasis is placed on the development of American education 
in relation to general social changes. The courses along this line are given by a spe- 
cialist in American history who is a member both of the department of history in the 
college of arts, literature, and science, and of the department of education. 
4. As contrasted with certain other institutions, there exists the most intimate 
unification of the activities and administration of the college of education and of gen- 
eral university administration. The college of education conforms to all general 
university rules and is financially and academically as much an integral part of the 
university as is the college of arts, literature, and science. Hence, as regards the 
special activities referred to in paragraph 3 of the questionnaire, one may make the 
following statements:   
-P-A-G-E-570
  516 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
(a) Teachers’ courses in special subjects are given in the college of education by 
instructors who are primarily members of its staff, but also in most cases members of 
the faculty of the college of arts, literature, and science, where they also give courses. 
(6) Physical education of men and women isa general university function, but some 
special courses in schoolroom gymnastics are given in the college of education. 
(c) There is a general university appointment office for placing teachers which 
cooperates constantly with the offices of the college of education. 
(d) There is a general university director of the relations with cooperating or accred- 
ited high schools who is also a professor in the department of education. 
(e) Extension work for teachers is also a general university function. It includes 
a correspondence study department and a special college which gives down-town 
extension classes on Saturday and during late afternoon hours. The dean of this 
college is head of the department of natural science in the college of education. 
(f) Field work is conducted largely in our own laboratory schools. Our high school 
numbers 400 students, and there is a similar number in the elementary school. A 
special industrial class is conducted in the high school; and a residential clinic for 
the’study of psychopathic, retarded, and mentally-deficient children is now in the 
process of organization. These laboratory schools are regarded by the university in 
the same way as other laboratories and are supported accordingly. 
In this connection there is one notable departure instituted by Mr. Judd which is 
worth mentioning. Most of the so-called experimental schools, from the time of 
Pestalozzi to the present, have been experimental simply in the sense that they 
varied the conditions of instruction. They seldom or never took the step of meas- 
uring adequately the results of the variations which they instituted. In our university 
high school and elementary school constant endeavors are made to measure the 
efficiency of the instruction, Upon this basis the efficiency has increased enormously 
in four years, and great economies have been effected. The most striking of these 
has been the reduction of the elementary school course to seven years without any 
elimination of content, thus making the combined elementary and high-school course 
11 years instead of 12. 
(g) Conferences of high schools in cooperation with the University of Chicago are 
held each spring at the university. These are organized by the director mentioned 
above in ‘6,’ and the proceedings are published in the School Review. Funda- 
mental questions of adaptation of high-school and college work are discussed. 
(h) The summer school is also a general university function. In this connection 
one of our chief problems is the organization of real graduate training for students 
who are doing all their work for the master’s degree in summers. 
(i) Educational surveys on a small scale are conducted by our graduate students in 
Chicago and vicinity all the time. These vary from surveys of typical city com- 
munities to surveys of rural counties. They constitute a favorite topic for master’s 
essays. 
(j) The maintenance of departments for training in home economics and household 
art and in esthetic and industrial education has been historically one of the chief 
characteristics of colleges for teachers, and continues to be so in our college of edu- 
cation. No special training for music teachers is provided here. 
(k) The department of education is a department of the graduate school of arts, 
literature, and science of the university, and is administered as any other graduate 
department is. The same criterion for advanced degrees ‘prevails, namely, ability 
to use scientific methods in the investigation of specialized problems, As stated 
above, the emphasis is placed on experimental; statistical, and historical technique. 
The general requirements for the bachelor’s degree in the college of education 
are the same as in the college of arts, literature, and science. In this connection 
attention is called to the well-known University of Chicago entrance and junior 
college requirements which were adopted a few years ago. Members of the faculty
-P-A-G-E-571
  PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING, 517 
of the college of education were among the most influentia] of the members of the 
general curriculum committee of the university which formulated these require- 
ments. In the senior college each student must pursue a major and minor subject 
known here as long and short sequences. If the student graduates in the college of 
education, one of these sequences must be taken in the department of education, 
and includes practice teaching. This makes from one-sixth to one-fourth of his work 
for the degree of a distinctly professional character. 
College of Teachers, University of Cincinnati.—Through an inter- 
esting series of developments from voluntary teacher associations, 
through city training and normal training stages, on to departmental 
work in the city university, the work for teacher training in Cincin- 
nati has this year culminated in the thoroughgoing, far-sighted organi- 
zation of the college for teachers of the University of Cincinnati. 
The city board of education pays the salary of the faculty of this 
teachers’ college, and the university provides a full four-year curricu- 
lum of well-articulated professional work leading to the degree of 
B. S. in Education. This full curriculum worked out by Dean 
Burris and his collaborators seems to set a desirable standard for 
institutions on similar foundations, and has many features which 
suggest a basis for mutual development and harmonization of uni- 
versity and public school interests which in some way any type of 
higher educational institution may well adopt. Further develop- 
ments toward differentiated curriculums for elementary and secondary 
school teachers are in progress. 
University of ,Pennsylvania.—The University of Pennsylvania 
within the year has received a legislative appropriation of $40,000 
with which to move systematically toward a complete scheme of 
teacher training. Two new full professorships were at once created, 
one in history of education and one in educational administration, 
and appointments have been made. It is confidently expected that 
the State’s interest in the better equipment of its teachers thus 
indicated will be even more marked from year to year. Pennsylvania 
is a State which can ill afford to delay work of this sort. 
School of Education, University of Pittsburgh—Another one of these 
“special universities” deserving special mention is the University of 
Pittsburgh, with its progressive and fully equipped school of educa- 
tion. The plan for furnishing practice teaching is notable. The 
report of this work reads:    
Perhaps the most characteristic thing we are doing is the practice teaching. You 
will note from our literature that we require daily schoolroom experience throughout 
our junior and senior years, which counts for one-fourth of the required work of those 
two years. I feel that our scheme of cooperation, which secures the highest type 
of practice teaching for us and a large amount of free instruction for the secondary 
and other schools of the community, is the best kind of practice teaching I have ever 
seen. We try to go beyond the mere perfunctory requirements of so many hours’ 
teaching. The teaching is actually of a very high grade. The supervision is first- 
class and as frequent and as constant as necessary, and in most cases our practice

teachers rank close to the best regular teachers of the faculty of the schools in which 
they teach. 
This particular plan, developed at Pittsburgh, has been adopted at 
Fairmount College, Kansas, and elsewhere. 
The school of education of Pittsburgh also announces the estab- 
lishment of a new type of high-grade school for little children, called 
“The school of childhood,” which is to embody the approved features 
of the kindergarten, the playground, and the Montessori school. . 
The program is based upon four fundamental instinctive activities, 
which reach out readily into the subject matter of the elementary 
school; (1) talking or communicating; informal conversations are held 
which lead to stories selected from the best literature, by means of 
which good habits of speech are acquired unconsciously; (2) nurtur- 
ing; indoor and outdoor gardening, birds, an aquarium, and some 
pets are provided and house plays with dolls are emphasized; (3) 
constructing; all modern play materials of educational value are 
furnished; (4) exploring; carefully planned excursions are made, 
exploring impulses are met in change and growth in play materials, 
and the development of the child’s body is noted by himself. Tests 
and measurements of the child’s physical development are taken. 
The school is directed by a play leader and a number of trained 
helpers. 
There is, it should be noted, an older but equally unique model 
elementary and kindergarten school well established at the University 
of Missouri. 
New developments might be noted and proposals of interest de- 
seribed at Cornell, Leland Stanford, and other universities of this class. 
Those noted above are perhaps the most striking and significant. 
Division of education, Harvard University.—Harvard University 
reports notable additions to its staff of professors of education, a 
general increase in number of courses, and a particularly notable 
expansion of its graduate work; four new graduate seminary courses 
were added during the year. 
Since 1912 the division of education and the city of Newton have joined in a unique 
and important educational enterprise—the maintenance of a fellowship for research 
in education, the incumbent to be a member of the staff both at Newton and at Harvard, 
and to organize and conduct investigations and experiments in the Newton schools 
and with the active cooperation of the Newton teachers. This fellowship is the 
Joseph Lee Fellowship for Research in Education. 
As a result of these advances the division has undertaken several new enterprises 
of general educational interest. The first volume of Harvard Studies in Education 
is to be published by the Harvard University Press in the course of the year; it will 
be a study of the social and professional organization of the teachers of Germany. 
The Harvard-Newton Bulletins are planned as.a series to embody the results of the 
work done in Newton under the Joseph Lee fellowship. The division has made good 
progress toward the foundation of a school under its own control and administration, 
a3a model institution. Ii is also engaged, at the invitation of another department of

the university, in a study in the field of college education which offers important new 
opportunities for valuable research. The general opportunity to undertake research 
and to be of service to the schools and to educational organizations is now, of course, 
much broader than before. 
This progress suggests the hope that the division of education at 
Harvard University may eventually achieve the goal toward which 
all university departments of education should strive—the establish- 
ment of the study of education and the training of college-bred 
teachers in an independent graduate school. 
Il. STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
Twenty-four State universities responded to our questionnaire, 
in most cases at some length. It is significant that eight of these 
report affirmatively on the first and critically important question 
regarding the administrative status of schools of education in univer- 
sities. This affirmative response indicates the desire rather than the 
fact in some at least of the cases. As a matter of fact, these organi- 
zations of schools of education are in many cases paper organizations, 
and not in a genuine way coordinate with other professional schools 
of the university. Apparently there is not one of them in which the 
director or dean has administrative authority over the itemized 
budget of instructional costs for all the instructional and other work 
of the students registered. A dean or director of a school of educa- 
tion is presumably responsible for the instruction in his school. 
Responsibility for instruction and professional interests generally 
would seem to demand a corresponding authority in budget matters 
such as engineering schools and medical schools enjoy. Schools of 
education in most State universities have not, however, reached this 
stage of differentiation. They ‘‘borrow” from the college of liberal 
arts or from other professional schools what service they can get. 
With these pseudoprofessional courses and their own education 
courses, they patch up a paper curriculum. Teachers’ courses in 
special branches, as the fifth annual report of the Carnegie Foundation 
showed, are in most cases merely a relisting of ordinary courses as 
“courses for the training of teachers” (p. 75). Teachers’ courses 
“borrowed” in this way are apt to be meaningless and functionless. 
Dean Russell, of Teachers College, who admits what a separate 
budget has meant for Teachers College, says that he does not look 
for any striking and vigorous development of schools of education 
in State universities until this elemental principle of university 
administration is observed. There are evidences that progress along 
this line is imminent. It is significant that 8 of our 24 universities 
reported ‘‘steps looking toward” this important readjustment of 
administrative responsibility and authority, and one other reports 
“proposed steps pending.”  
-P-A-G-E-574
  520 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Cooperation with other. college departments.—The majority reporting 
on the question upon this subject state instances of effective coopera- 
tion of schools of education with other professional schools or semi- 
independent technological divisions of university work. There are 
illustrations of this cooperation with all these departments cited in 
the question, and, in addition, with such departments as home 
economies, engineering, and fine arts. The most frequent examples 
of cooperation are with agricultural departments. 
At the University of Missouri the medical school and the school of 
education work very closely together in a course in preventive medi- 
cine. In the dissemination of this information the school of educa- 
tion is of the greatest importance. 
Activities under the control of departments of education.—The signifi- 
cant fact is that 21 of 24 universities report teachers’ courses. This 
means that in some way the academic departments are professionally 
cooperating with schools or departments of education in furnishing 
to intending teachers the special methods and peculiar technique, 
as. well as more fundamental educational principles and distinctive 
values of the actual subjects the students will teach when they take 
positions in the schools. The proper coordination of the university 
forces contributing to teaching efficiency is the curriculum problem 
for the immediate future in university administration. At present 
the solutions are about as numerous as the institutions concerned. 
The following note with reference to some characterization and 
standardization of teachers’ courses when properly organized into 
a professional curriculum for teachers is taken from a bulletin of the 
University of Kansas school of education: ’ 
The items enumerated below are suggestive of the kinds of topics with which the 
following 19 (Kansas University) teachers’ courses in special branches are concerned: 
1, A simple statement of the broader aspects of the distinctive field of education, 
indicating the special adjustment of the moral, esthetic, social, and practical disci- 
plines to be reasonably expected from a study of the subject. 
2, A brief sketch of the actual history of the subject in the school curriculum, show- 
ing the gradual change and improvements in the textbook presentations of the sub- 
ject, and the gradual improvements in other apparatus than textbooks, adopted for 
use in teaching it. 
3. The gradual change in the conception of its educational value and the degree 
and nature of correlation with other subjects, particularly since the report of the Com- 
mittee of Ten. 
4, The growing refinement of methods for presenting the subject. 
5. The grade preparation to be presupposed at present, its present status, as seen 
from a comparison of typical high-school curriculums, together with the social, psy- 
chological, and practical obstacles to its attaining its ideal educational aim. 
6. The necessary, and also the more ideal, preparation called for in the teacher, 
academic and professional. 
7. References to books and special monographs dealing with the topics of the 
course, and a suggested list of books desirable for reference for high-school libraries. 
 
-P-A-G-E-575
    PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 521 
Data received in reply to the questions indicate that in many 
eases the recommendation of teachers for schools, the inspection 
of schools, and the direction of summer schools are administratively * 
a division of the work of schools of education. In many other cases 
the work is done by the same men, although organized as a more 
general university function, A noteworthy fact is the large and 
rapidly increasing number of institutions whose schools of education 
maintain high-school conferences and summer schools or conduct 
education surveys. Of the 28 universities, 21 report graduate work. 
Psychological clinics and efficiency measurements.—The school of 
education of the University of North Dakota reports the establish- 
ment this year of a psychological clinic, which is to be conducted 
in connection with the psychological laboratory. As Table I indi- 
cates, a similar organization is under way at Chicago University. 
From the University of Oklahoma comes news of a new department 
of “Measurement of Efficiency and Standardization,” in charge 
of the school of education. Mr. S. A. Courtis is the “consulting 
director.”’ The special practice teaching regulations reported in full 
from the University of Oregon are thus summarized:   
We consider the practice teaching most fundamental. This is supervised by the 
department of education, but with the cooperation of the various departments. The 
actual cooperation of the various departments in their special subjects has been instru- 
mental in spreading the professional attitude through the faculty which has resulted 
very profitably and pleasantly to all concerned. 
Changes in requirements for admission and for graduation.—The 
replies to our questionnaires disclose several instances of advance in 
both admission standards and requirements for certificates, and also 
one instance of lowered standards by the introduction of a short 
normal curriculum. 
Among the items which seem to indicate notable progress the fol- 
lowing may be quoted from the University of Tennessee: 
A State law in effect 1914 requires six half-year courses in education for university 
graduates to entitle them to first-grade professional high-school certificates. Hereto- 
fore the rule was that only two three-month courses in education must deal specifi- 
cally with secondary education. 
From Wyoming is reported the regulation of “(25 semester hours 
in professional work in a four-year course for high-school teachers 
receiving the B. A. degree in education.” University of Virginia 
reports, ‘20 semester hours are required for the State certificate.” 
Graduate work in education.—The Universities of Illinois and Wis- 
consin report great increase in graduate study in education, and they 
cite special requirements, which have been worked out with care, 
specifying how the master’s degree in education may be won partly 
in absentia. The records from other universities show the same thing. 
It seems that the master’s degree in education is practically a teach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-576
  522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
ing degree, sought and won in increasing numbers chiefly by those 
who have ambitions for special equipment for teaching and adminis- 
tration, but whose penchant is not for college positions ultimately, 
and whose professional advancement does not allow or call for the 
work usually demanded for the doctorate. The problem of properly 
providing for and adequately directing graduate work in education 
by study in summer schools only is acute and general. The demand 
can not be adequately met with present provisions. (See last table.) 
The University of Washington outlines a policy for this type of 
advanced graduate work in education during regular and summer 
sessions which raises the issue: 
The most unique feature is in the organization of the graduate work in the school 
of education. We have provided that candidates may plan for a three-year course 
beginning with the junior year and including a year of graduate work. For these 
three years of work they would receive the bachelor’s degree in either the college 
of liberal arts and sciences or the school of education, and the master’s degree in the 
school of education. The additional year of work required for the master’s degree 
is designedly not overspecialized. It is intended to be extensive rather than over- 
intensive. A rigid examination will be required in the work of education, in the 
academic major, and in the two academic minors, but no thesis will be required. It 
is not intended to make this year one of specialized, but rather of thorough scholarship 
in education, and in one academic major subject, supported by two academic minor 
subjects. The intention is to make our school a genuine professional school on a par 
with the school of law in the university. 
Activity in building.-—One of the most striking instances of progress 
in teacher training is the simultaneous erection of buildings for schools 
of education in seven southern universities, each building bemg pro- 
vided from the Peabody fund and each university recipient being 
under obligation to expend annually upon teacher training a minimum 
of $10,000. If the institutions carry out faithfully the intention 
of such beneficence, it is reasonable to expect that the type of teachers 
in southern high schools will be much better. This impetus to teacher 
training is also of critical significance to the whole future develop- 
ment of State universities in the South. These institutions as a 
tule have not seemed to respond to the call for definite professional 
service to the State at large as effectually as the western universities 
have. In this connection should be associated the development of 
the Peabody Teachers College, which has ambition to become for 
the South what the Teachers College and Chicago School of Edifcation 
are to their respective sections of the country. 
Among the important building and equipment items are to be 
noted especially the model training high schools which are now under 
construction at the Universities of Wisconsin and Illinois. The one 
at Wisconsin is to be known as the Wisconsin High School and will 
be ready for occupancy by February, 1914.
-P-A-G-E-577
  PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 523 
Other evidences of progress.—Another sign of progress is the enlarge- 
ment of museum, laboratory, and library equipments and appoint- 
ments. Typical of the items reported, but exceptional in its unique 
value, is the report that: 
The pedagogical library of the late Prof. Aron has been purchased by the University 
of Illinois for its school of education. .It comprises approximately seven thousand. 
titles and is especially rich in documents relating to German education in the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries. It contains also rare first editions of the educational 
elassics and a number of valuable manuscripts. 
There are certain other items of interest from these activities of 
State universities which should be briefly mentioned. The University 
of Kansas reports that: 
There is pending in the University of Kansas a proposition to organize a course of 
two years for the training of directors of physical education, superposed on the college 
work. The proposition is to coordinate theoretical and practical work in such a way 
as to justify the conferring of the bachelor’s degree in education. 
’ There is strong likelihood of a similar development at the Univer- 
sity of Illinois. Some significant steps in this direction have been 
taken. 
With all these interesting items of progress and many more of the 
same sort, and with the eagerness to maintain a high professional 
integrity and high ideals on the part of the professors of education, 
one can not fail to realize, nevertheless, that State universities are 
not really responding adequately to the great opportunity open to 
them in this field. A natural academic conservatism is good to fight 
against, but the opposition to proper equipment and more particu- 
larly to separate organization for schools of education now appears to 
denote on the part of many men in college faculties a fear of conflict- 
ing interests rather than a conviction regarding the function of a 
State university. 
Iv. THE SMALLER COLLEGES. 
The smaller colleges in the main administer conservatively the 
traditional liberal arts curriculum. It should be kept in mind, how- 
ever, that teacher-training is the only kind of professional work 
attempted, and that it is only on this basis, or pretext as the case 
may be, that such institutions maintain a status and secure official 
recognition by the State in whatever professional preparation of 
high-school teachers they may do. Many of these institutions report 
that the majority of their graduating classes are preparing for teach- 
ing. Many use their annexed academies as practice schools, and it 
will be noted in the table that many report the development of teach- 
ers’ courses. Few are attempting graduate work. Dartmouth Col- 
lege and Dickinson College, of those reporting, seem to be exceptions 
in minimizing their teacher-training functions. Dickinson reports 
“‘a single elective” course, and Dartmouth, with a large enrollment
-P-A-G-E-578
    524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
and status as a semi-State institution, provides no department or 
separate instructor in the field of education as a college study. 
The table shows that the smaller colleges, as a rule, are responding 
to the modern demands for trained teachers in the same way as the 
universities. They utilize means of cooperating with other depart- 
ments, do extension work for teachers, hold school conferences, main- 
tain summer schools chiefly for teachers, and in a surprising number 
of instances conduct surveys. It will be noted that six such insti- 
tutions have effective affiliations with city or village public-school 
systems and are providing the practice and observational facilities 
so essential to effective work in educational departments. One other 
interesting teacher-training activity, which will be mentioned later 
with reference to normal schools also, is that of an institutional 
policy of attempting to “follow up” the work of their alumni as 
teachers in the schools. 
In many cases these colleges must be “standardized” by the State 
board. before their graduates may be “certificated to teach”? without 
examination. This relationship brings about, as the answers to 
question 6 indicate, the policy of conformity to State certificate laws 
in the teacher-training courses. The result is that the smaller colleges 
are important professional schools, and many of them could not other- 
wise exist. This official status as licensed teacher-training institu- 
tions suggests that the State board might be provided with the proper 
means to accomplish the much-needed standardization. In Kansas 
the State board of education has a commission at work on the prepa- 
ration of a “‘manual of college standards,” a guide to the State college 
visitor in his work of inspecting the State’s higher educational insti- 
tutions whose teacher-training curriculums must be approved. Such 
State efforts might well perform local service for the standardizing 
bodies of wider scope, such as the North Central Association, the 
Association of American Universities, the National Association of 
State Universities, and the United States Bureau of Education. 
Two other items deserve special mention in the teacher-training 
work of these colleges. Rutgers College seems to be taking its 
teacher-training function seriously. A part of its report is as follows: 
Steps looking toward progress in teacher-training taken by the department of 
education of Rutgers College point along four general lines: 
1. The reorganization of the courses in educational subjects into definitely planned 
curriculums of study designed for the professional training of secondary-school teachers. 
2. The establishment of a summer school for teachers. During the summer of 1913 
more than 300 New Jersey teachers already in service attended the school, taking 
professional subjects required by the State for teachers’ certificates. The school’ was 
supported by an appropriation of State money. It was organized as a part of a more 
comprehensive movement in the State in connection with four other summer schools 
for teachers. 
3. The establishment of extension courses at the college and in other centers for 
the training of teachers already in active service in professional subjects of study.
-P-A-G-E-579
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 525 
4. An attempt to cooperate with the work of the State department of public instruc- 
tion and with the work of the various educational institutions of the State. 
Swarthmore College reports the following high aim for educational 
work: 
The new department is being organized on comprehensive and scientific lines around 
the central aim of thorough preparation through intelligent participation and experi- 
mentation in school work. On every hand the aim will be to emphasize the modern 
empirical and scientific points of view in psychology and education. Therefore, 
experimental laboratory courses will be given in both these fields in order to make the 
work concrete, definite, and scientific. In order to connect theory and practice and to 
formulate principles of education, all theoretical and historical courses will be paral- 
leled by work in school observation and practice teaching and in experimental edu- 
cation in contemporary school problems. 
It is perfectly clear from the foregoing that the small colleges, even 
the denominational ones, particularly in the West, are largely teacher- 
training institutions; several report that two-thirds of their seniors 
are looking forward to teaching. The small colleges in Kansas yearly 
train ag many high-school teachers as the State university. In all 
States some of the small colleges are of low grade; some do merely 
normal-school work in their educational departments; and others are 
poorly equipped. All this emphasizes the force of the contention 
that their professional service should be recognized and standardized 
by the States, at least in respect to teacher-training. 
V. NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
A letter was addressed to presidents of normal schools requesting 
accounts of recent progress. Sixty-nine very full and satisfactory 
replies came from 33 different States. One need only read these 
letters to be persuaded that the cause of teaching is an impelling 
one and will prosper. The replies contain a bewildering number of 
items of significance, difficult to classify, and practically impossible 
to put in tabular form, even the sort employed for data from colleges 
and universities. Normal schools still are, at least for the different 
States, individualistic. Perhaps the first impression one gets from 
these letters is that the normal school leaders are severally at work in 
entirely different sections of the field. There is a need, if not for 
some delimitation of function, certainly for some distinguishing stand- 
ard with which to classify institutions so different, yet bearing alike 
the name of ‘normal school.”’ It is true, indeed, that some are chang- 
ing this name and with it the distinctive features of the traditional 
normal school. “Normal university,” “ teachers’ college,” or“ normal 
college’ would seem to refer to an institution different from the insti- 
tution whose best descriptive name is still ‘normal school,” and quite 
as different in form and function from the school of education of a 
university or the department of education of a liberal arts college 
 
-P-A-G-E-580
  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Typical statements of progress—The latter distinction is well made 
by the following important communication from Teachers’ College, 
Greely, Colo. The communication has valuable comments on devel- 
opments in teacher training; the item with reference to graduate 
work and a graduate degree is particularly significant. 
1. A course in biology and one in sociology has been put in the list of professional 
courses required of all students, these courses to be regarded as coordinate with psy- 
chology. We are entering upon the second year of this arrangement. The new 
courses in biology and sociology that have become required courses are not of the tra- 
ditional type, but represent selections and organization of subject matter in these 
fields with special reference, as has been the case with older courses in psychology, to 
the fact that the students are headed toward the profession of teaching. 
2. The idea of the major has been introduced into our professional training. We 
are now entering the second year of this arrangement, except that there have long 
been special courses for the training of teachers of kindergarten, manual training, 
physical education, domestic science, music, and art. The idea of the major is now 
extended to all departments and is especially fostered in the work of the third and 
fourth years. Especially significant is the application of this idea of the major to the 
vocational problem as over against the subject-matter conception of the major. This 
you will notice especially in our plan for majors in primary teaching, intermediate 
grade teaching, grammar grade teaching, elementary school supervision, high-school 
supervision, public-school supervision. In all of these majors actual practice work is 
required over and above that which is common to all of our students, and this practice 
isin the specific field indicated by the major; also a higher standard of teaching ability 
is necéssary to earn the designation of major, whith carries with it the presumption of 
higher training in the professional activity indicated. 
8. Marked emphasis is placed upon the scientific examination of children in the 
training school, the work being conducted by an expert trained under Dr. Witmer. 
Also courses have been developed in clinical psychology, psycho-clinical practice, and 
mental hygiene—the last so recently differentiated (though not new to our work) that 
it does not appear in our last catalogue. They will now be offered as distinct courses 
in the department of psychology. 
4. Graduate work in professional lines was begun this year, such work to lead to the 
degree of master of arts in education and to conform with the usual or standard require- 
ments for the degree in other colleges. Emphasis will be laid upon the organization 
of this graduate work for each candidate for the degree in terms of direct relationship 
to actual or prospective vocational needs. At the same time there are certain general 
requirements calculated to insure professional breadth in the fundamentals of biology, 
psychology, sociology, educational principles, and current educational problems. 
5. A start has been made on the difficult problem of education with reference to 
sex, some work having been done in the elementary school and in the high school that 
is more than that of occasional lectures. Methods are investigated of introducing the 
subject to prospective teachers of children. In the meantime considerable attention 
is given to the topic in its setting in other courses such as biology, psychology, soci- 
ology, physical education, hygiene, and education. 
6. The museum idea in this institution, though not new, is worthy of special men- 
tion. We. have an abundance of museum material, located where it is of most imme- 
diate use, i. e., mostly in connection with the classrooms of the various departments. 
There is here no museum as a curiosity, a place to be visited occasionally, generally 
under lock and key. A part of the museum idea is pictures and statuary everywhere 
that appropriate places can be found; also gardens, poultry yards, trees, flowers, 
shrubbery, beauty of environment. These are all to be used for educative purposes
-P-A-G-E-581
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 527 
and practice teachers are directed and encouraged to draw upon these museum 
resources. 
The report from the State Normal University, of Normal, IIL, 
states in even more specific terms the somewhat extended field in 
which this particular institution proposes to work, notably, the prep- 
aration of secondary teachers. 
It is the purpose of this institution to train every sort of teacher needed in the public 
schools of Illinois from the kindergarten through the high school; hence the State 
Normal University is organized in four schools: 
1. The teachers’ college, to prepare high-school teachers, supervisors, principals, 
and ‘superintendents. In this school four-year programs are provided, leading to the 
professional degree of bachelor of education. 
2. The normal school, to prepare teachers for grades, elementary schools, rural 
schools, and village schools. It provides for high-school graduates programs two years 
in length for upper-grade teachers, for lower-grade teachers, for kindergarten-primary 
teachers, and for special teachers of agriculture, art and design, public-school music, 
manual training, household art, and household science. Programs from three to five 
years in length are provided for students who are not full high-school graduates. 
3. The university high school to serve as a school of observation and training for 
students in the teachers’ college. 
4, The elementary training school, consisting of the kindergarten and eight grades 
to serve as a model school for observation and training for students in the normal 
school and teachers’ college. 
We have also a country school department, in which a two-year program is provided 
for graduates of the eighth grade who are not less than 16 years of age when admitted. 
Also a one-year program for graduates of the tenth grade. Upon the completion of 
these courses these elementary students may obtain a third-grade teachers certificate 
in the public schools of Illinois, and upon the completion of three years’ additional 
work may receive the normal-school diploma. 
In the advancement of this program we have secured as a school of observation and 
training for the country school department the cooperation of the Walker School, 6 
miles south on the trolley line. The school has the best building of all the one-room 
country schools in McLean County. We have placed in charge Miss Eula Atkinson, 
of Montgomery, Ala., formerly a teacher in the State Normal School at Jacksonville 
in that State. The teacher’s salary, $1,200, is paid in almost equal amounts by the 
local district and the State Normal University. 
In further development of our agricultural department we have secured an appro- 
priation of $22,000 for farm buildings and stock for the normal university farm of 95 
acres. It is intended to demonstrate upon this farm good farm methods in raising 
farm, crops and care of live stock. The legislature has also provided funds for the 
opening of acommercial department for the training of teachers of commercial branches 
for the high schools of Illinois, This school will be opened the summer of 1914. 
The report from the “Michigan State Normal College, Ypsilanti,” 
gives another account of progressive movements which in several 
items are similar to those reported above, notably the reorganization 
into differentiated curriculums of the programs of study offered, and 
the attempt systematically to deal with the critical and delicate prob- 
lem of the teaching of sex matters in the public schools. The item, 
however, which is of the greatest interest is the reference to the legis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-582
    528 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
lative policy of permanent development covering a period of seven 
years. 
One feature of the normal college which is worthy of mention is the opportunity 
which it offers for specialization. About one-half of our 1,500 students are taking 
what is termed the general course. The other half are what aré known as specializing 
students. Specializing courses give students an opportunity to follow to some extent 
their individual tastes and to prepare themselves for the special lines of work in a 
public-school system. The principal departments in which specializing is done are 
home economics, physical education, kindergarten, primary, music, drawing, manual 
training, commercial, and secondary education. Under secondary education, stu- 
dents may specialize in any line of high-school work. 
In addition to these specializing courses covering two or three years, the college 
offers courses leading to the B. Pd., and the A. B. degrees. The former degree is given 
to those who have done three years of college work and the latter to those who com- 
plete the full college course. The State Normal College stands second. to the Univer- 
sity of Michigan in the preparation of teachers for Michigan high schools. To meet 
more fully this increasing demand for high-school teachers, the college expects to place 
more emphasis on the training of secondary teachers. 
The college is also experimenting in extension work. Last year the teachers of a 
city of some thirty thousand requested extension lectures for which credit would be 
given at the college. A course of lectures was given through the year with very grat- 
ifying results. Requests from other cities have been received this fall, and it is likely 
that more than one course will be offered during the present year. 
During the past few years several movements looking to the welfare of the students 
have been inaugurated. Most worthy of mention are the creation of the office of dean 
of women, the employment of a college nurse, and the establishment of a college infir- 
mary. These have added greatly to the well-being of our students. 
In order that the opinion of the student body might have an influence in the admin- 
istration of the college, last year the faculty council authorized the establishment of 
astudent council, to be composed of representatives from the college classes from the 
‘Young Men’s Christian tiation and the Young Women’s Christian Association, 
elected by those organizations. The student council has already fully justified its 
creation. 
It may be of interest to know that for five years the normal college has offered a course 
insex hygiene. This course has been elective for young women, and it is worthy of 
note that over 800 have elected the course. In almost every class there has been an 
attendance beyond the reasonable limit of the classroom, and in many instances more 
students applied for the course than could be taken care of. 
Like nearly every educational institution, the physical equipment of the normal 
college has never been equal to the demands placed upon it. Friends of the institu- 
tion are greatly cheered by the fact that the Michigan Legislature of 1913 voted an 
appropriation of $100,000 for seven consecutive years for buildings and grounds. 
  Two accounts of the characteristic developments which may be 
expected in the typical normal school as distinguished from the 
exceptional institutions quoted above are given below. The first 
comes from the Winthrop State Normal and Industrial College of 
South Carolina. 
For general training: 
We have increased the time given to practice teaching fully fivefold. 
We have organized and conducted under expert supervision a mixed school such as 
will be found in sparsely settled communities which do not afford enough pupils to
-P-A-G-E-583
  PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING, 529 
justify employment of more than one teacher, or to make it possible to form every 
grade every year. 
We have offered courses of study to prepare teachers for community work in rural 
communities. Teachers taking these courses are fully prepared to take charge of 
classes in elementary agriculture, in domestic science, and in domestic arts. 
We offer courses preparing teachers for the high-school business courses, such as 
_ stenography, typewriting, and bookkeeping. 
We have organized and conducted with full expert teaching force a school for train- 
ing inall needs inacountry home. Every detail of work needed in the home is made 
part of the school curriculum. This school is carried on as an independent organiza- 
tion, not an annex to some other line of work. 
We are offering to those teachers of the State who have not had an opportunity to 
secure college training a one-year teachers’ course. Anyone holding a valid county 
teachers’ certificate is entitled to take this course. Those completing it will receive 
from the State board of education a certificate good for five years. The course is so 
arranged that teachers desiring to take it can attend for one term of 12 weeks, if they so 
desire, This enables them to come without interfering with their work as teachers. 
The following letter, similar to the above, is likewise representative 
of the great majority of reports of normal-school progress in teacher- 
training. These items are from the Millersville State Normal School, 
of Pennsylvania: 
First. In classifying students who enter this normal school from high schools, we 
hold strictly and rigidly to the rule that graduates of recognized third-class high schools 
may enter the freshman year without examination; that graduates of second-class high 
schools may enter the sophomore year; and that graduates of first-class high schools 
may enter the junior year on the same condition. 
Second. Correlating the high-school course with the normal-school course. Every 
graduate of a high school of recognized standing is given an application blank to be 
filled by the high-school principal. Whenever the work done in the high school is 
equivalent in quantity and quality, as judged by this record, to the academic require- 
ment in the normal course, full credit is given. In this way graduates of first-class 
high schools may complete the normal course in two years, graduates of second-class 
schools in three years, etc. 
Third, The maximum of 18 or 18? hours of work per week is set by the authority of 
this school whenever such work requires out-of-class study and preparation. The stu- 
dent may add some handwork. 
Fourth. A special course in rural-school methods and rural-school problems will be 
given for the first time during the school year 1913-14. 
Fifth. Equipment. For the teaching of the sciences three complete laboratories 
are ready for use, which were remodeled and equipped during the summer of 1913. 
Heretofore there was but one laboratory. We designate them the biology laboratory, 
the chemical laboratory, and the physical laboratory. 
Sixth. The manual-training department has been modified to include domestic art. 
The ladies of the school spend at least two-thirds of the school year in manual work, 
half of which is devoted to handwork for the grades under the head of cardboard con- 
struction, raffia, etc.; the other half is given to making garments, 
Seventh. Financial. For the first time in the history of the schcol a definite budget 
system has been adopted by the board of trustees. 
Eighth. Summer school. For the first time in the history of this normal school a 
regular summer school was conducted, beginning June 30 and continuing six weeks, 
Ninety-seven students were registered. The course offered included many of the 
regular course subjects, as well as several additional branches to suit the varying 
17726°—ap 1913—vor 1—34   
 
-P-A-G-E-584
  530 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
demands of the students. The school has been particularly helpful to teachers, pro- 
spective teachers, and students. It has been the means of removing conditions im- 
posed on many students who are ready to enter the studies of the senior year. After 
the close of the summer school the board of trustees voted to continue this policy. 
Coordination in theory and practice.—Nine normal schools report 
an increase in the students’ hours required to be devoted to practice 
teaching. Fourteen schools report plans just adopted whereby there 
may be closer affiliation and cooperation between the regular staff of 
teachers and the practice work. These reports indicate a shifting 
of emphasis from the scholastic development of pedagogical theory 
and educational science to the development of that educational 
theory and science which the instructor can illustrate in the model 
school. The State Normal School, of Wayne, Nebr., expresses the 
principle thus: 
In this institution we are following the plan of haying one man as head of the 
training department, which includes the theoretical as well as the practical phases. 
All critic or training teachers are under his supervision, and all instruction along 
the lines of psychology, child study, and history of education is given or directed by 
him. This brings a unity which can not be had when the theory and practice are 
not controlled by the same individual. It avoids the embarrassing situation of occa- 
sionally having the theory and practice at cross purposes. I feel that it is a very 
decided improvement over the old plan of having a superintendent of practice and 
two or three heads of the theory department. 
The principle seems to be so important that an additional citation 
may be added from the Southwestern State Normal School, Okla- 
homa: 
I question the value of the heavy courses in the history and philosophy of educa- 
tion, as well as the value of much of the alleged pedagogy carried in the curricula of 
many normal schools. The normal schools need to slough those courses which merely 
serve the purposes of pedantry. They need to descend to their problem and meet 
their students on the level of their needs. They need to give the students something 
which can be used in teaching. Furthermore, I seriously question whether a majority 
of those teachers who carry the academic work of the normal schools are doing their 
work in accordance with sound pedagogy. As a corrective for these conditions we 
have devised in the Oklahoma State normal schools a series of courses known as 
pedagogy by demonstration. It consists of lessons conducted with classes of chil- 
dren in the presence of the class in pedagogy by the heads of departments. Some of 
these gentlemen complain that they are compelled to do a great deal of extra work. 
Nevertheless, I am pleased to report that this work seems to be the making of some 
of them, as well as of great practical value to the students. 
Affiliation with rural schools—Rural practice and demonstra- 
tion schools, or schemes for affiliation with near-by farms, seem to 
be indispensable accessories to a certain type of normal schools. 
Seven normal schools report this equipment added within the year; 
one reports a ‘vocational model school,’ and one a reorganized 
model six-year elementary and three-year intermediate school. The 
following communication from Iowa State Teachers College suggests 
the educational significance of these ventures:
-P-A-G-E-585
    
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 531 
The most recent thing that we have done at this institution is to start the plan of 
organizing demonstration country schools. One of these schools is in an independent 
district, and we exercise supervision over the school and pay part of the salary of the 
teacher. This is used for observation and to demonstrate what is possible in country 
school work. We expect to secure the cooperation of a whole township near the 
campus of the teachers’ college in which to make this sort of development of country 
school education. It is not our intention to reorganize these schools by consolidation 
or any other method, but by putting in them well-qualified teachers and giving 
them expert supervision to prove that there is no better school than a well-managed 
country school. 
We have also organized rural school training classes, called normal courses of county 
certificate standard. Special attention is given to this class of students by a com- 
mittee of the faculty under the direct management of the professor of rural education. 
We are also beginning a course of study under the title, vocational normal course. 
Furthermore, we are organizing centers in which members of the faculty meet the 
teachers of any township or community and give from two to three lessons each week, 
such work being done on Saturdays. These centers are to be maintained specially 
for the benefit of country school teachers, but centers for city school teachers also 
will be organized. It is not expected that anything more than expenses will be 
charged these centers for such work. 
The State Normal and Training School, of Cortland, N. Y., has 
equally unique and original features: 
During the past two years this school has developed a curriculum for training 
teachers of agriculture in secondary schools. The curriculum, which covers a period 
of two years, requires college preparation for admission, and only young men who 
have had farm experience are admitted to the course. General work in the theory of 
agriculture is given in addition to shopwork in wood and iron and in the theory and 
practice of teaching. 
The unique feature of the course is that all experimental work in the way of farm 
crops, fertilizers, dairying, etc., is carried on in accordance with our specifications 
and for our benefit by neighboring farmers in return for advice and help given them 
by teachers of the school. The students in this course are in demand as speakers 
before neighboring granges, and the experience that they get in mixing with prac- 
tical farmers has proved to be of the greatest service to them in their subsequent 
experience as teachers, for it is plain that if secondary courses in agriculture are to 
succeed the teacher must have the support of his farmer neighbors as well as of their 
sons. 
All experiments are continued during vacations, and results are checked by a 
member of the faculty who is employed for 12 months in the year. 
Graduates go out with courses of study definitely outlined by topics. They know 
what they should teach to high-school students, what equipment should be purchased 
with a given amount of money for the installation of courses in agriculture, and where 
this equipment may be secured to the best advantage. The diploma is a life license 
to teach agriculture in the schools of the State of New York. 
In addition to these vigorous forward movements for increasing 
the efficiency of rural education, it is significant to note that 16 nor- 
mal schools report recently effected affiliations with near-by school 
systems to the end that the latter may be used for practice and 
observation. Eight of these affiliations are with city school systems, 
and eight are with rural schools; two other normal schools are 
acquiring school farms and two are systematically utilizing near-by
-P-A-G-E-586
  
  532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
farms for purposes of training teachers for rural, schools, a plan 
strongly advocated by efficient workers in the field of agricultural 
education, notably Dean Eugene Davenport, of the University of 
Hllinois. 
The following from the Chico State Normal School, California, 
suggests a method of affiliations with rural schools: 
During the past year we have introduced, as a part of the actual experience in our 
training school, a two weeks’ apprenticeship in the rural schools of this vicinity 
for every student-teacher. Two student-teachers are assigned to each rural school 
in the morning and two in the afternoon. They do whatever work is assigned to them 
by the rural-school teachers, who are in turn directed by our directors of extension 
work. This relationship has proved of value to the rural schools, and it has supplied 
to our students the necessary familiarity with the important aspects of rural-school 
administration, and some experience in dealing with them. We think it is the most 
valuable two weeks that they spend in the normal school, and we feel that it, or some- 
thing like it, is a necessary element in the training of any teacher who proposes to take 
up rural-school work. 
In addition to the above items specifying progress in teacher 
training for rural schools, 15 normal-school presidents and 2 State 
superintendents of public instruction report recently instituted 
plans for special courses of study and differentiated curriculums for 
improving the quality of rural education. 
Affiliations with city public schools.—A paragraph from the “plan 
of affiliation” adopted by the Fresno (Cal.) State Normal School 
will illustrate the city school affiliation plan: 
By special arrangements with the Fresno city board of. education, our practice 
teaching is done in the public schools. A number of the city teachers are selected 
for their special fitness, and to each are assigned two cadet-teachers for an hour on 
every school day. These city teachers are paid from the normal funds $120 each per 
annum in addition to their regular salaries. The head of the training department 
in charge of the upper grade work and his assistant in charge of primary work have 
general supervision over the training of teachers. Each day they meet the student- 
teachers in their respective departments, and give an hour’s instruction in theory 
and methods. They also hold individual conferences with students as occasion 
suggests. Each student is required to take the theory and practice for both primary 
and grammar grades. Several ungraded classes are available for special training in 
handling schools comprising several grades, 
In this scheme all theory and methods are given directly in connection with prac- 
tice teaching, each subject being specially considered at the time the student-teacher 
is handling it in the classroom. 
Schools for observation.—A pedagogical issue is raised by 13 differ- 
ent normal-school presidents which seems to merit serious thought 
and well-considered plans for scientific testing. These men write 
of a change in policy looking toward providing for intending teach- 
ers better and more distinctively observational or clinical facilities 
as preferable to mere practice facilities. The report from the Mil- 
waukee State Normal School represents and well expresses the com- 
mon sentiment of the 13 who comment upon this point:
-P-A-G-E-587
  PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING, 533 
The particular step which the Milwaukee Normal Schcol has taken this year has 
been to change its practice school to a model school. Hereafter, instead of using 
the school as a place for the normal-school students to do practice teaching, the stu- 
dents will visit the school by regular assignment, for the purpose of observing methods 
of instruction and management. Substantially all the work of the school will be done 
by skilled teachers employed on account of their supposed ability to conduct the 
daily exercises of a classroom in a manner worthy of the study of young people who 
are in training for the work of teaching. In certain minor matters assistance will 
perhaps be rendered to the model teachers by students assigned to them for that pur- 
pose, and under the direction of the model teacher the students will be permitted 
to do such work as, in the teacher’s judgment, can safely be intrusted to them, It 
is planned to show in this department, also, a model curriculum in arrangement 
of hours and in selection and arrangement of subject matter. 
Improvements in many directions.—Thirteen replies announce new 
equipment in buildings, practice schools, dormitories, or other con- 
siderable addition to the physical plant. Two schools report new 
kindergarten features with Montessori principles; four describe ad- 
ditional preparation offered for prospective high-school teachers. 
Many announce steps taken into the field of training the so-called 
“special teachers”; 12 have added equipments and arranged special 
curriculums, not merely additional courses, for domestic science 
teaching, 16 for teaching of agriculture, 9 for drawing and manual 
training, 6 for music, 3 for special physical training, 4 for teaching 
commercial subjects, 3 for teaching the strictly industrial or the so- 
called ‘“prevocational” work of upper grades, and 3 for teaching 
“normal training” work. Two institutions report successful courses 
for teachers in the problems of sex, and one reports a curriculum and 
facilities for preparing prospective teachers to deal with exceptional 
children. Several other institutions announce “courses” in this 
general field, though not “curriculums.” This impressive total of 
institutions reporting some thoroughgoing progress in curriculum- 
thinking and curriculum-making is one of the most striking advances 
noted in the whole survey. One might properly add here courses 
for training in library work, graduate or research work, and corre- 
spondence courses, all decided extensions of the traditional pro- 
gramme. 
There are eight accounts of fundamental changes in policy with 
reference to prescription ‘and election of courses, and one other 
school reports the intention of “doing away with electives altogether.” 
Several begin to doubt the pedagogical soundness of the present type 
of course in the history of education and in experimental psychology, 
and are introducing other fundamental courses of sociological, eco- 
nomic, and ethical character. Many speak in favor of the plan 
adopted in Minnesota and Wisconsin for normal schools to supple- 
ment other State institutions of higher learning by offering two 
years of college work. The experiment seems to be ‘working well 
and not interfering,” according to reports.
-P-A-G-E-588
  534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Eight schools report the inauguration of extension teaching with 
the policy of establishing at strategic points what are termed ‘“ teach- 
ing centers,” The following account of the work from the Macomb 
(il.) Normal School adequately presents the essential elements in 
this work, and is, moreover, descriptive of probably the most notable 
instance of extension teaching, although striking instances are 
numerous: 
I consider extension work the greatest addition which we have made to our school 
work. Two years ago we made the experiment of sending one member of our faculty 
to one of our largest towns in this section, Quincy, to give regular normal school courses 
to the teachers in the public schools there. About 60 enrolled for this work, and 
carried two subjects, principles of teaching and psychology. ‘The instructor met the 
class about 20 times during the year. The work was carefully supervised, and the 
results were extremely good. The interest was such that many of these teachers 
were led to enroll in the summer school and they have continued their work since; 
many have completed our normal school course. The results of this undertaking 
were entirely satisfactory, and last year arrangements were made to carry on the work 
on a very much larger scale. A regular member of our faculty was employed as ex- 
tension director, to give all of his time to such work. Arrangements were made 
to have classes organized in 10 different centers within the district from which our 
school draws its support. Outlines were carefully prepared in psychology, principles 
of teaching, history of education, sociology, and geography. These outlines were 
placed in the hands of the teachers who enrolled for the work, textbook assignments 
were made, and supplementary readings were arranged. The main reference work 
was carried on through the secondary text which treated similar subjects to those 
treated in the primary text. Each one of the classes was met from 16 to 20 times 
during the year, beginning in September and closing the last of May or the first of 
June, At the end of the courses examinations were given. Those teachers who 
had done satisfactory work and passed satisfactory examinations were given full 
normal school credit for each course carried. No teacher was expected to carry more 
than two such courses; many of them but one. The school officials were enthusiastic 
about the work and have written many letters complimentary to the undertaking. 
Another common phase of this extension work is what might be 
called rural social work. The four institutions reporting it employ 
some one to spend his entire time in rural institute activities. 
Certain educational ‘‘novelties”’ in the way of curriculum offerings 
should be noted. In new curriculums, or in “‘short courses,” are offered 
in some schools definite instruction in moral training, special per- 
sonal hygiene for teachers, social hygiene, use of Montessori material, 
the various standardized tests for spelling, arithmetic, handwriting, 
and English composition, and instruction in dancing and in plays 
and games, as rowing, tennis, walking, and field games, and one 
attempt at ‘outdoor school work in a screened pergola.” Educa- 
tional museums are reported, and several attempts at demonstrations 
of reorganizations of the grades and of the methods and devices for 
promotion of pupils are described. 
The following letter from the Indiana State Normal School shows 
the immediate response to important State legislation which normal 
schools make:
-P-A-G-E-589
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 5385 
A law enacted by our general assembly of 1913, known as “The Vocational Educa- 
tion Law,” requires the teaching hereafter of industrial and vocational subjects in 
all the grade and high schools of the State. The work will include vocational subjects, 
industrial education, domestic science and arts. The general assembly increased 
very materially the tax for the support of the Indiana State Normal School—the 
State’s institution for the training of public-school teachers. This increased income 
will enable the institution to make early provision for training teachers for the new 
lines of work. We are already planning a large building to be used exclusively for 
the training of such teachers. Work will begin on this building within a few months, 
and it is hoped to push it to completion so that it may be ready for use early in the 
school year of 1914-15. There is at present in Indiana a very great demand for teach- 
ers of these subjects, and it is impossible to supply thisdemand. The changes which 
the new law will bring about in the school system of Indiana are the most important 
and far-reaching that the State has seen for many years. It will require several years 
for these new subjects to be well correlated with the old academic subjects and to 
reduce everything to smooth working order, but we are confident that, by careful 
study and experiment, the two kinds of work may be carried on together and be made 
to reinforce and strengthen each other. 
There are some chafings at legal restraint. A normal school in 
Pennsylvania for example has not the freedom to make essential 
changes without the consent of the majority of the 12 other State 
normal schools. 
A recent law in Vermont, by allowing recognition to training 
courses in high schools equal to that accorded to the two normal 
schools, apparently tends to lower the standard for teaching in that 
State. The Kansas Legislature recently repealed a law which pro- 
vided that by 1917 no one not at least a graduate of the normal 
training course of an approved high school should be allowed to teach 
in any school of the State. These two laws mark about the only 
steps noted in this survey which seem to be retrogressive. In con- 
trast with them is the following note of progress in Maine: 
The legislature of the State of Maine at its biennial meeting, January, 1913, passed 
the following law: ‘‘No person shall be employed to teach in any school under the 
supervision and control of any school board of any city, town, or plantation of this 
city, after September 1, 1914, who does not hold a State certificate as herein provided. 
No person unless he is 17 years of age and has completed a standard high-school or 
academy course shall be eligible for a certificate.” 
No school law ever passed in the State of Maine was so drastic as this law; no law 
ever passed in any State will ever do more for the rural schools than this law will do 
for the rural schools of Maine. Children without education may no longer teach (?) 
school in Maine. 
  Indiana reports still higher standards. In Pennsylvania the school 
code of 1911 provided for the transfer under certain conditions of the 
property of the normal schools of the State from private ownership 
to public ownership and complete public control. From other States 
also come reports of similar change in administrative control, of the 
adoption of definite budget systems, and of methods of modern 
“scientific management” generally, not only in finance administra- 
tion, but also in systems of scholarship records, and of machinery 
 
-P-A-G-E-590
   
    536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
for maintaining announced entrance standards, transfer of credits, 
and “straight” graduation. 
On the whole the traditional normal school is tilling its own field, 
refining its courses, improving its equipment, raising its scholarship 
standard, and performing a genuine and enthusiastic service in 
training teachers for the elementary public schools. 
Many other scattering features of this branch of teacher-training 
might be cited, but the movements described in the foregoing para- 
graphs are representative. It should be noted that there are in- 
stances, as the case cited from New York, of tendencies to extend the 
school term to cover the whole year. Four additional schools report 
the beginning of a regular summer session of six or eight weeks, and 
others are planning to do so. 
The following paragraphs taken from a bulletin of the State Normal 
School at Spearfish well delimit the general field in which most of 
our institutions of this grade are working: 
The purpose of the State normal school is to train teachers for rural schools, village 
schools and principalships, city schools, the teaching of special subjects, the county 
superintendency, and for work in at least the smaller high schools. 
To do all of this it must be more than a high school, more than an industrial school, 
more than a commercial school, more than a training school. It must be all of these 
in one. It must offer the best instruction in all subjects taught in good schools. It 
must have admirable teachers and admirable equipment. It must do much and 
strong professional work, and the professional department must have as its laboratory 
a large and admirably conducted practice school. 
Organization of subject matter.—The discussion of progress in normal 
schools has thus far been concerned primarily with administrative 
items; it seems fitting to close it with an account by Dr. Charles A. 
McMurry, of a pedagogical policy which, with modifications, might aid 
college teaching and high-school work, as well as elementary schools, 
for it is almost if not quite as much needed by them. Dr. McMurry 
thus describes the work which he is conducting at the Northern 
Illinois State Normal School: 
During the past two years in our training school we have been concentrating our 
effort upon the subject matter of school studies, with a view, first, to selecting the 
leading central topics in each study and to arranging these so as to get a far simpler 
and better organized course of study. Second, to carefully working outa full treatment 
of these important topics as examples of organization and method. 
_ We have been trying in this way to put into the hands of young teachers at the 
beginning of their practice work, in each case, an adequately worked out treatment 
of whatever topic is to be handled. The problem we have set ourselves is far more 
difficult than might at firstappear. The difficulties to be met may be briefly indicated: 
First. Our present course of study is too bulky. It is an over accumulation of new 
and old materials, often not well-organized. We have too many things to teach and 
all too crowded to get anything well taught. 
Sécond. Our textbooks do not furnish full and adequate treatment of topics. In 
fact they lay no claim to such fullness of concrete detail and illustration as most topics 
require.    
-P-A-G-E-591
  
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING, 537 
Third. In spite of a good high-school training and of a year’s preliminary study in 
the normal school, students who are entering upon practice teaching are by no means 
masters of the special topics which they are expected to teach. We may summarize 
the main features of our plan in the following series of points: 
1. We are putting this large collection of knowledge-materials in our present course 
through a sifting-out process. The result is the selection of a few main topics or units 
of study, which form the basis for reorganizing and simplifying the course of study. 
2. We have set ourselves the task of working out an adequate treatment of these 
important topics, showing how much concrete, descriptive material—pictures, maps, 
etc.—is needed in each case to give the topic a completely satisfactory presentation. 
These full treatments we have reduced to typewritten or printed form, for whatever 
has been worked out effectively by one teacher may be later used by other teachers who 
have these topics to handle. * * * 
3. We have therefore set our mature and best-trained teachers to work upon these 
large topics or units of study, to collect and organize this material and to bring it into 
satisfactory form for use in the classroom. * * * 
4, When a young student is called upon to teach one of these topics, we put this 
complete and well-organized material into his hands with a carefully developed 
outline or sequence of main points, with a series of further references to library books 
and pamphlets, and with a few suggestions as to the method of treatment. * * * 
5. Our thought is that young students will learn the principles of organization better 
by dealing with rich, well organized material which thoughtful experienced teachers 
have already molded into shape, than with miscellaneous reference materials which 
the young teacher has neither the time nor ability to bring into shape. As soon as he 
has acquired some notion of what is meant by organization, he may be called upon 
to do some of this planning and organizing himself. 
6. Our young teachers find that they must expend the full measure of time, labor, 
and ingenuity at their disposal, in mastering these already prepared and organized 
materials, and in getting the whole subject into good shape for successful classroom 
treatment. * * * 
7. The result of our plan, however, is much better actual teaching of the children. 
In such a plan as this the children are not much sacrificed to the experimentation of 
young and ill-prepared teachers. The just criticism against much of our practice 
teaching can be, to a considerable extent, silenced by this kind of careful forethought 
in preparation. 
8. The planning of daily lessons is much simplified by such a scheme of working 
out large and important units of study. As a usual thing we do not try to plan each 
day’s lesson as a unit. The entire topic, or unit of study, may require a half dozen 
or a dozen recitations to work it out completely. The teacher’s planning directs 
itself to the entire unit of study. * * * 
Before allowing a student to teach one of these large units of study we try to give 
him a test or examination on the topic to see how well-prepared he is before teaching 
it. Then after the student has taught the series of lessons to a class of children, we 
frequently give the children a test to see how well the work has been accomplished. 
We are not trying to lay out a fixed and unchangeable plan and method for hand- 
ling any particular topic. We hold ourselves free at all times to revise or change the 
treatment of any or all of our units of study. Every time a particular topic is taught 
the teacher is free to revise or improve it according to her judgment. Or it may be 
thrown aside if some better topic isfound. In this way we hope to free ourselves from 
fixed formal and arbitrary routine. In classroom work, we feel that the teacher should 
remain free to operate according to her own convictions. 
For analysis of the strictly professional instruction in education 
offered in a representative number of normal schools see Table IV.

VI. STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
In requesting information from State superintendents of education, 
the following topics were mentioned to indicate the sort of information 
desired: 
1. Extent to which the various colleges of the State that furnish teachers for the 
public schools are adopting higher standards, academic and professional, for intended 
teachers. 
2. Specific advance steps noticeable in the grade of professional work done by the 
summer county institutes, and in the administration of these institutes. 
8. Improvements in the reading circle as organized in your State; such, for example, 
as different departments for high-school and grade teachers. 
4. Some reasons for believing that high schools (cr county normal schools) are or 
are not successful in their efforts at teacher-training. 
5. Means provided for making teachers’ certificates based upon examination more 
nearly equivalent to certificates based upon academic and professional work done in 
the regular curriculums of normal schools or colleges. 
6. Specific statutes adopted by your recent legislature providing for teacher-training 
in high schools. 
Full replies were received from 20 State departments. In regard to 
question 1, practically all replies cite instances of raised standards of 
teaching. In Kansas the State board of education has recent legal au- 
thorization for standardizing teacher-training colleges; for over a year 
a committee from representatives of accredited colleges of the State 
has been at work preparing a manual of college standards. This docu- 
ment is expected to fix minimum standards of admission requirements, 
graduation requirements, training of professors, laboratory and library 
equipment, equipment of the department of education, etc., and maxi- 
mum teaching hours per week for instructors. Any State college 
which can not measure well up to such a standard shall forfeit the 
right to certify to the State board its graduates as qualified to teach in 
secondary schools. 
The reports from many of the small colleges indicate that they are 
conforming to the requirements of their respective States. This 
centralization of the standardizing function for teacher-training 
institutions of a State, though yet not very common, is in the end 
inevitable. It appears that 27 States now require some professional 
study of education with college graduation for certain teacher certifi- 
cates. Others, without legal provision practice this method. The 
average number of college-credit hours in the professional study of 
education is now about 15 in addition to systematic observation and 
practice teaching, and there are many reports of increase in this 
requirement. 
The number of States with no central system of teacher certifica- 
tion is less each year; Illinois adopted the central certificating plan 
in 1913, though with a low requirement. All this indicates the 
importance of establishing through the central agency of the State
-P-A-G-E-593
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING, 539 
department of education minimum standards for all grades of teach- 
ing. Until recently the larger cities, those of the first class particu- 
larly, have not been willing to subject themselves to some minor 
inconveniences that follow uniform State certification. There are 
evidences now that ideas of local autonomy will not continue to pre- 
sent this hindrance to the elevation of the standards of teaching as a 
profession. 
Answers to question 2 indicate the importance which the State 
education departments place upon summer schools of all grades, 
from those at State universities to the county institutes. <A lengthy 
discussion of the developments in this connection occurs in a later 
section of this survey. 
In general, the information received relating to reading circles is 
significant. More and more that work is centralized under the 
direction of the State superintendent. Here also one finds greatest 
interest, and in most cases greatest faith, in the plan of State subsidy 
of high schools undertaking teacher-training functions. 
Certificates upon examination —It may be said that almost all 
State departments have the right to award certificates upon their own 
examinations in lieu of graduation after academic and professional 
study in a higher institution of higher grade. This is a necessary 
provision, but in its administration it has often resulted in lowered 
standards. Some of the replies evidence an appreciation of this fact 
and outline plans for more thoroughgoing tests. 
Teacher training in high schools—The answers to the questions 
indicate the further spread of the movement to make of high schools 
an important factor in teacher training. That movement is of great 
significance in the immediate development of secondary education. 
The normal training now administered not merely as additional 
courses in the general high-school program, but more and more as 
full, differentiated, thoroughly worked out curriculums for segregated 
groups of young candidates for teaching. Although there are some 
who are strenuously opposed to the movement, State superintendents 
and normal school presidents generally approve the policy, and look 
upon it as the only device now available by which we may hope to 
raise the present low standard of teaching in the rural schools. 
There is cause for gratification when a State like Indiana can afford 
to add this professional work to a full four years’ academic high- 
school work. In most States it is a question of practical import how 
far the laws can go in requiring academic preparation and profes- 
sional training without making it impossible to man the country 
schools. Another bearing this whole matter has upon secondary 
education is the effect it is already having in adding momentum to 
the movement to extend the regular work of secondary schools to 
include two additional years.

  540 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
GENERAL CONDITIONS IN CERTAIN STATES. 
Wisconsin.—Most State superintendents are concerned with the 
larger policies with regard to what might be called the State’s teaching 
assets. The following report from Wisconsin illustrates the attitude 
taken by most State superintendents, although that State is unique 
in some of the provisions described: 
Standards of teaching.—In the State university there has been an effort to confine 
the teaching license to the subjects in which the teacher “‘majored.”” The teachers 
are not recommended for other lines of work than those in which they have majored, 
although sometimes practical necessity requires that they teach other things. It is 
required in late years that an intending teacher shall have had’a course in the pedagogy 
of the subject she is majoring in. There is also a definite requirement of two-fifths of 
professional work. The other colleges of the State whose work is recognized in the 
granting of State certificates must come up to the standard of the State university. 
The normal schools have been making slight advances in their requirements, but 
no notable advances. 
Summer normal schools.—In place of the one and two week institutes formerly held 
in each county, we now require all persons who have never taught to attend a profes- 
sional school for teachers and to obtain credits in four subjects: Methods in reading and 
language, methods in geography, methods in arithmetic, and methods in school man- 
agement. A professional school for teachers is defined as a county training school 
for teachers, a State normal school, or a school of equivalent rank, offering courses simi- 
lar to those offered in the State normal schools. By this law all teachers have had at 
least six weeks of professional training before commencing their work. In addition 
to the above requirements, county superintendents in all of the counties, by the aid 
of the State, hold two or more two-day institutes. In counties remote from the train- 
ing schools and normal schools, superintendents have held one-week institutes. 
Rural teachers.—The training and normal schools are doing more effective work, 
owing to the fact that men with more experience in rural conditions have been placed 
in charge of the professional work. There has been a tendency in the normal schools 
to offer instruction to the beginning teachers that was better fitted for grade work than 
for work in rural schools. The difficulty has been to engage instructors for the pro- 
fessional work in the professional schools who had the ability to teach and manage a 
one-room rural school. 
Each professional school is maintaining an ungraded, model department that as far 
as possible embodies the conditions that will confront teachers in the one-room rural 
school. This model department is taught by an experienced country school-teacher, 
and beginning teachers are required to observe the methods of this teacher. 
Greater attention is paid to the academic proficiency of the would-be teacher. 
Greater stress is put on the mastery of the subjects taught in the common schools by 
those who expect to teach. 
There is not so marked a tendency on the part of the teachers in the classes in 
methods to neglect country school conditions and emphasize graded school work. 
The serious problem in methods is to adapt them to the needs of the persons who are 
to teach in rural schools. This tendency of instructors to keep in mind city conditions 
is rapidly disappearing. 
Reading circles.—About two years ago a teachers’ reading circle was organized, but 
the county was made the unit of effort rather than the State. A committee will report 
to the meeting of the State teachers’ association next month on desirable changes in 
the organization and management of teachers’ reading circles in the State. This com- 
mittee will also report on the advisability of the formation of a State young people’s
-P-A-G-E-595
        PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 541 
reading circle. The teachers’ reading circle has not concerned itseli much with the 
reading of other teachers than those in the rural schools. 
Normal courses in high schools.—The legislature of the State, session of 1913, made 
provision for establishing 27 departments in 27 different high schools for the training 
of teachers, and for paying the cost of the instructor from State funds. Such training 
departments can not be established in counties which maintain a county training 
school for teachers, of which there are 27. The law does not specify how much aid 
may be given, but the State superintendent has practically decided that no school 
shall receive more than $1,000 of this aid per year, and in no case more than the salary 
of the teacher who administers the course. 
School boards invariably give preference to persons that have completed the course 
of study offered at a county training school for teachers or at a high school maintaining 
a similar department. 
There is no disposition on the part of the county boards of supervisors to abandon 
county training schools. In fact, these schools are firmly established as part of the 
educational policy of the State, and the legislature at its last session made provision 
for the establishment of four more schools, 
State school inspectors invariably report that they are able to tell without previous 
knowledge whether or not a teacher in a rural school has had professional training at a 
high school or at a county training school. School boards are willing to pay a higher 
salary to teachers that have had this training. In late years the teachers writing for 
State certificates are expected to produce field and laboratory notebooks showing that 
they have done work in such subjects as biology and physics as given in the schools 
and colleges. This usually means the necessity of attending such institutions at least 
for a time. 
  Connecticut.—The puzzling response from Connecticut is an excep- 
tion and leads to speculation as to what other thing a State depart- 
ment may do in this matter of influencing progress in teacher training. 
None of the questions touch the conditions in this State. 
At the risk of saying too much in response to your interrogatories I venture the 
following: 
1. None of the colleges of the State furnish teachers for the public schools. 
2. There are no summer county institutes.. Usually we have a State teachers’ 
meeting covering four to six weeks. 
3. The reading circle is not organized by the State. There is a voluntary reading 
circle very limited in its scope. 
4, High schools do not undertake teacher training. 
5. No means have been provided for making teachers’ certificates equivalent to 
any other certificates. 
6. There are no statutes providing for teacher training in high schools. 
The foregoing does not mean that we fail in training teachers or that our schools 
are without trained teachers. 
We have no county organization. We have no State system of higher education. 
  Massachusetts.—A sort of high-giade service of a technical peda- 
gogical character which a State department can, with great effective-. 
ness and on a large scale, render the schools of an entire State is well 
typified in the work under the direction of Dr. David Snedden, State 
commissioner of education for Massachusetts. He distributes to 
both elementary and high-school workers valuable pamphlets of 
discriminating advice concerning the principles of curriculum making,
-P-A-G-E-596
  542 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
the principles of choice of courses of study, and the essential factors 
of method in distinguishing functions and fundamentals in different 
courses and in the organization of teaching material, both as to 
curriculum and daily schedule making. This service stands, among 
the activities of State superintendents, on a plane with the work of 
Dr. McMurray in normal schools, which was discussed at some length 
on a previous page. 
Alaska.—The conditions in Alaska are exceptional and deserve full 
treatment, which is not practicable here. The following, however, 
will convey an idea of the state of affairs: 
In Alaska there have been no recent changes in the administration of the white 
schools of the Territory, and there have been few advanced steps. The white schools 
in Alaska are maintained by direct appropriation for that purpose by Congress, the 
governor of the Territory being ex officio superintendent of schools. The Territorial 
legislature has no control over educational affairs in Alaska. That body, however, 
has memorialized Congress asking that steps be taken to secure a systematic inspec- 
tion of the schools and the adoption of a uniform course of study in the schools of 
the Territory. 
Alaska has no colleges; but in the graded schools, which are confined to the incor- 
porated towns for the most part, higher standards, academic and professional, are 
being adopted for teachers employed in these schools. Teachers’ institutes are 
unknown in the Territory, partly because the distances between towns are so great 
as to make them practically impossible; for the same reason, there are no reading 
clubs except, perhaps, in local high schools and among grade teachers. 
The work done by most of the high schools of Alaska is without doubt thorough, 
for graduates are admitted to some of the State universities upon their certificates 
of graduation obtained from the high schools. It is also to be presumed that their 
efforts at teacher training are more or less successful. While the teachers in the 
schools of incorporated towns, I believe, are generally required to have certificates 
from normal schools or colleges before they are employed, in the white schools outside 
of the towns no examination for teachers’ certificates is required. Teachers, how- 
ever, must have certificates from some normal school or college, upon presentation 
of which a license to teach is issued by the ex officio superintendent of education 
for a period of two years. 
No statutes were enacted by the recent Territorial legislature providing for teacher 
training in the high schools for the reason set forth, namely, that the legislature has 
no contzol over the Territorial schools. 
  IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE. 
Not eyen a partial account of recent progress in teacher training 
should fail to mention the various policies and plans in operation for 
the improvement of those teachers already in service. Some of these 
progressive steps may be mentioned briefly. 
There are many instances of the provision for professional improve- 
ment of teachers through more systematic direction of their reading. 
Virginia, West Virginia, and other States wisely differentiate the 
requirements for reading for the different classes of teachers, elemen- 
tary and secondary. Rochester furnishes a well-planned teachers’ 
professional library and reading room, opened last September. 
 
-P-A-G-E-597
PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING, 543 
Of more professional interest, perhaps, are the steps taken by pro- 
gressive cities in the provision for constructive classroom supervision 
which follows in a professional spirit some definite mutually under- 
stood standard of teaching. Illustrative of this is the recently pub- 
lished ‘‘supervision card”’ issued by the New York bureau of municipal 
research, a copy of the Ohio survey card, containing items for re- 
cording factors in classroom efficiency. Nothing perhaps so defi- 
nitely marks genuine progress in training for teachers in service as 
the repeated indorsements and adoptions of such standards by 
school supervisors. The same may be said of definite graduated 
scales for the measurement of merit and for the promotion of teachers. 
Beyond these signs of the general development of a teacher’s 
professional conscience, significant administrative recognition is 
accorded teachers’ attempts at self-improvement. Many more school 
boards than ever before are providing “visiting day” for teachers, a 
step toward other and better plans for teacher improvement. More 
cities are adopting the policy of paying teachers full salaries while 
attending teachers’ meetings; others recognize summer-school attend- 
ance in their promotion poliey; others make definite reimbursements 
for certain outlays for professional improvement; others encourage 
leaves of absence for travel or study and make provision for auto- 
matic reinstatement in position without the formality of reelection. 
The most advanced cities, Boston, Rochester, Cambridge, and others, 
make provisions for leaves of absence on salary for such purposes. 
Another improvement of very great significance is the voluntary 
organization of teachers of the whole country on a high professional, 
but avowedly protective basis. The National Council of Education 
and the National Education Association in its most recent meeting 
have heard the elaborate plans for guild organization. Several State 
teacher organizations have made moves in the same direction.   
   
Vil. CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
Much should be said in any adequate report of progress in teacher 
training concerning the constructive, extensive, and in a sense 
gratuitous or at least self-protective work of preparation of teachers 
done by city systems of education. Many far-seeing city superin- 
tendents are adopting Supt. Maxwell’s fundamental idea that every 
school, elementary and high, as well as every city training school, 
shall contribute in its proper way to the training of teachers. With 
this conception of the work, many cities are adopting plans by which 
teachers in training may do practice teaching under the guidance of 
critic teachers and may observe gifted teachers at their work, while 
rendering substitute service. Notable among such cities are New 
York, St. Paul, Rochester, Spokane, Omaha, New Orleans, Paterson, 
N. J., Louisville, Ky., Kansas City, Mo., Birmingham, Ala., and
-P-A-G-E-598
    544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
others. Almost every one of these cities presents some unique 
feature either of organization or of educational conviction of the 
pedagogical principles involved. 
The following are extracts from letters sent in response to an inquiry: 
Kansas City, Mo.—A normal training department has recently been established to 
prepare teachers for elementary schools. Two years following graduation from the 
high school are required, the first year in theoretical work, the second as cadet or 
substitute teacher. 
During the past year no teachers have been employed who have not received pro- 
fessional training. We hope in the near future to advance the requirements both in 
theoretical and in practical work. This year we are placing our cadets under critic 
teachers at different places within the city. Two of these cadets are placed in charge 
of rooms having adjoining grades, and under the exclusive care of a critic teacher. 
They are required to do consecutive work in some specific grade, for at least 12 weeks, 
after which they are given an opportunity to do practice work in other grades. We 
feel that very efficient work is done in preparing our best high-school people for 
places in our elementary schools. 
Louisville, Ky.—When the graduates of the normal school first become teachers in 
the public schools they are given the title “substitute teacher” and are paid $45 per 
month for a half year. At the end of that time, if their work has been satisfactory, 
they are made “temporary appointees” and receive $50 per month for half a year. 
At the end of this year, if their work continues to be satisfactory, they are recom- 
mended as permanent teachers in the Louisville public schools at a salary of $55 per 
month, Thereafter, advancement depends upon the growth of the teacher and the 
ability of the board to give special increases in salary. 
The advantage of this plan is that the normal school graduates do not feel when 
they receive their diplomas that their preparation for the teaching profession is com- 
pleted. Now they understand that they must continue to grow in order to receive 
permanent appointments in the Louisville schools. It is during this first year as 
teachers that they should be most ready to accept criticism and profit by it. The 
attitude of these people is quite different from that of the normal school graduate who 
believes she is going to receive a permanent position the very moment she has com- 
pleted the two years’ work in a city normal school, and that it is not necessary for her 
to continue to study and improve her technique. 
This plan is also followed with the graduates of the Kentucky State normal schools 
and all persons employed to teach in the city schools. They must spend at least one 
year on probation before they are given permanent positions. This plan is not very. 
different from the plan followed in other cities, the feature being that the teachers 
themselves realize that the first year must be a year of growth. After that the most 
efficient teachers are the ones who receive special increases from year to year. 
Paterson, N. J—Training of teachers for city schools requires a different course of 
professional study and a type of practice school different from those for training teachers 
for rural schools, because conditions and problems are essentially different. This 
applies not merely to special method work, special studies, etc., but to the more 
general studies—psychology, school administration, history of education, etc., in 
which, while the two classes of teachers may follow the same general direction, the 
incidence of attention and application will be different. It is an established fact 
that elementary school teachers and secondary school teachers can not be trained in 
the same courses; the difference is no greater than that between rural and urban 
teachers. Yet, in the average normal school, little distinction is made. The city 
training school is a specialized institution, doing advanced professional work. 
The practice school is the laboratory of a normal school and should be thoroughly 
coordinated with it in administration. Thisis ouraim. The starting point is in the 
    
-P-A-G-E-599
  PROGRESS OF TEACHER TRAINING. 545 
practice school for the study of psychology, management, class administration, edu- 
cational sociology, special method courses, general method, and even, in a way, 
history of education. Young students take hold of these studies with better under- 
standing of their inner meaning and value, if they approach them through the con- 
crete. Not only this, but professional study should continue through the course, 
so that, when practice begins, the student will give part time to observation and 
practice and part to professional study, with the new light thrown on it by actual 
participation in school work. During the first stage of professional study, students 
visit different grades for observation and model lessons. Later they take up actual 
teaching under supervision for from one-half to two-thirds of each day and make a 
general study of school conditions, school administration, school methods, and school 
children, and a special study of particular problems of class administration, par- 
ticular methods, and particular children. At the same time they continue their 
study of general professional subjects. This correlation between practice teaching 
and classroom study of great subjects strengthens and broadens each part of a pro- 
fessional course and helps the normal teacher to keep his class work in close touch 
with the everyday work of the schools and adapt it more fully to the practical needs 
of normal students. Too long have study and practice teaching been separated— 
thus tending toward the abstract. Our aim, very imperfectly realized at present, 
has, I believe, great promise in it. 
New Orleans, La.—There is need that practice teaching should be conducted under 
conditions very similar to those prevailing in the regular schoolroom.’ A plan should 
be provided by which the critic teachers and supervisors of practice teaching in the 
normal school could follow up the graduates of the normal school during their first 
and second years of teaching. This follow-up plan is needed, since it frequently hap- 
pens that the principal under whom the new teacher secures her first experience is 
not sympathetic toward normal-school training. This causes discouragement to the 
young teacher, and often results in her abandoning some of the very best methods 
taught in the normal school. 
Vill. SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
The development of summer schools of all grades has been unparal- 
leled, and it seems to presage an era of all-the-year-round instruction 
in higher institutions. Whether or not this will be the outcome, it is 
certain that summer schools are undergoing radical changes in 
administration and methods, and are also fast becoming a sub- 
stantial factor in the educational scheme of the country. The 
larger universities, like Columbia and Chicago and some State 
institutions, find it practically impossible to provide teaching facili- 
fies for the great number of teacher-students who apply. In increas- 
ing numbers the normal schools are abandoning the Chautauqua 
idea and conducting regular summer sessions for teachers. In the 
same way the large district and the smaller county institutes are 
becoming summer schools and assuming that name, offering in some 
cases differentiated courses of a strictly professional character for 
the teacher groups attending. As an instance of this extension of 
function of the summer county institute may be cited the “summer 
school” of Frederick County,.Md., under the direction of J. M. 
Gambrill, “the result of the desire of the public school teachers for 
17726°—rp 1913-—vou 1——35
-P-A-G-E-600
    546 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
real professional study.” The purpose of the school for August 18 
to September 5, 1913, was thus stated: 
To displace the old-fashioned ‘‘inspirational” institute in which the whole body 
oi teachers listen to lectures for several days, and to substitute in its stead real school, 
in which teachers are divided into groups according to the nature of their special 
problems, are supplied with books and material for serious study, and work coopera- 
tively with their instructors for a sufficient time to accomplish tangible and practical 
results. A reference library will be available. The cla: will be conducted so as 
to give opportunity for questions and discussions, and in each course the subject 
will be treated with special reference to the course of study and particular problems 
of the respective groups. Each instructor will have conference periods during which 
the student-teachers may consult him individually. 
Sessions will be held in the mornings, five days in each week, irom Monday to 
Friday. The afternoons will be left free for the reading assigned by the instructors 
and for the preparation of prescribed exercises. Work will in all cases begin promptly 
according to schedule, and attendance records will be kept by all instructors. 
The plan of organization provides the following groups: (1) Primary: Beginners, 
chiefly for those of very little or no experience; (2) primary (rural): For teachers of 
one-room and two-room schools; (3) primary (urban): For teachers in graded schools 
with three or more teachers; (4) rural (grades 4-7): For teachers in one-room and two- 
room schools; (5) urban (grades 4-5); and (6) urban (grades 6-7): For teachers in 
graded schools with three or more teachers; (7) high school: For teachers of grades 
8-11. 
The extent to which normal schools do already, and will to a 
greater extent, figure in this summer work for teachers is suggested 
by the following report from the New York State department of 
education, at Albany: 
The principal advancement which has been made in this State in the requirements 
for teachers’ certificates has been in those set for teachers employed in the rural 
schools. The elementary certificate, the lowest grade issued for the rural schools, 
has been discontinued. It has also been announced that the academic certificate, 
one issued to a high-school graduate who has earned a regents’ academic diploma, 
will not be issued after August 1, 1915, unless the holder of such diploma completes 
asummer course in a State normal school. The requirement for admission to training- 
course classes has been advanced so that no student who has not completed at least 
two years of high-school work may be admitted to one of these classes, The majority 
of the members of these classes now are high-school graduates. The summer session 
at the Oneonta State Normal School was continued and it is intended to open all 
State normal institutions for summer courses. A special rural school course was 
established in the Brockport State Normal School. The course requires instruction 
for one year, and the completion of four years’ academic work is set for admission to 
such course. The number of training classes has been increased from 81 to 114, the 
maximum limit fixed in the law. These changes are important steps toward a require- 
ment which shall demand that all rural school teachers shall have completed a four 
years’ academic course and at least one year of professional training in a course espe- 
cially adapted for rural schools. A reading course has been established for rural 
teachers through the cooperation of district superintendents. 
The present requirement for all other elementary school teachers in this State is the 
completion of a four years’ academic course and a two years’ professional course in a 
State normal school or a city training school. 
      The general proportions of summer-school work in universities is 
indicated in the following tables and statistical comparisons:

          This chapter is a brief résumé of the current activities of certain 
of the educational boards, foundations, associations, ete., which are 
a prominent feature of present-day educational progress in the United 
States. The number of these agencies has so multiplied that it is 
impossible to give a comprehensive report of all that are doing val- 
uable work; and the chief purpose of the following pages is to sum- 
marize particularly the work of such of theso organizations as may 
not be specifically treated elsewhere in this report. For obvious 
reasons the work of one or two organizations not strictly educational 
is also reviewed, whenever this work affects current educational 
thought or is closely allied with education. For a list of educational 
associations, State, national, and international, with the names of 
their officers, see the Educational Directory issued by the Bureau of 
Eduéation (Bulletin, 1913, No. 46). 
I. EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 
GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The functions of the General Educaticn Board comprise: (1) The 
promotion of practical farming in the Southern States; (2) the develop- 
ment of a system of public high schools in the Southern States; and 
553, 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-608
    
554 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
(8) the promotion of higher education throughout the United States. 
Independent educational work is not the object of the board, but 
rather the securing of results through established institutions and 
agencies. The following is a summary of the financial report for the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 1913, submitted to the Secretary of the 
Interior by the treasurer, Mr. LL. G. Myers, of New York City: 
(1) The Rockefeller fund.—Principal account, $30,918,063.80; reserve, $1,867,336.03; 
total, $32,785,399.83. Income account: Balance on hand July 1, 1912, $4,903,802.83; 
income for year, $2,257,583.70; total available, $7,161,386.53. 
(2) John D. Rockefeller special fund (subject to order of Mr. Rockefeller).—income 
account: Balance July 1, 1912, $961,625.63; income for year, $423,168.79; total, 
$1,384,794.42. Expenses, $1,347.02; gift to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical 
Research, $615,294.77; gift to University of Chicago, $20,000. Balance: Investments, 
$604,660.19; income receivable, $77,985.66; cash on deposit, $65,506.78; total, 
$748,152.63. Principal account: Original gift, $21,335,784.20; balance of original 
gift, $893,111.10.    
    
  CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
The seventh annual report of the Carnegie Foundation for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 1912, comprises two parts: Part I, relating 
to the current business of the year; Part II, discussing current educa- 
tional problems of interest. 
The endowment of the foundation during the fiscal year has been 
increased by $2,000,000. Mr. Carnegie transferred $1,000,000 to the 
trustees in December, 1911, and in May, 1912, he transferred a 
similarsum. The trustees hold in trust at present about $14,000,000. 
During the fiscal year, the trustees were in receipt of an income 
aggregating $676,486.56. They authorized a total expenditure of 
$634,496.89. Forty-eight retiring allowances were granted during 
the year, of which 32 were in accepted institutions and 2 in institu- 
tions not on the accepted list. During the year 20 pensioners died. 
Of those admitted to the benefits of the foundation, 32 were professors 
and 11 were widows of prefessors in accepted institutions; 2 were 
professors and 3 widows of professors in institutions not accepted. 
Thirty-one of the number were retired on the basis of age and 3 
on the basis of permanent disability. The general average of retiring 
allowances for the year was $2,000. The total number of allowances 
in force (September 30, 1912) was 398, and the total grant in force 
at that date was $603,855. The expenses of administration of the 
foundation were $36,949.31; educational investigation and publica- 
tion, $27,124.55. The executive committee added no institutions to 
the accepted list during the year, resolving— 
that all applications of institutions to be placed upon this list should await the receipt 
of a report concerning the present and prospective financial obligations of the founda- 
tion, based upon the actuarial study now in progress.
-P-A-G-E-609
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. 555 
Tn his report the president, Dr. Pritchett, treats the whole question 
of pensions for teachers, for Government employees, and for industrial 
employees, and finally discusses a feasible pension system for the 
public-school teachers of a State. In the second part of the report 
the following topics are treated: College entrance requirements; 
admission to advanced standing; medical progress; university and 
college financial reporting; advertising as a factor in education; 
education and politics; sham universities. The foundation pub- 
lished during the fiscal year Dr. Abraham Flexner’s elaborate study 
of medical education in England, Germany, and France, which forms 
a necessary supplement to the study of medical education in the 
United States and Canada brought out two yearsago. 
In January, 1913, Mr. Andrew Carnegie gave $1,250,000 to the 
foundation, in the form of 5 per cent bonds, to be devoted exclusively 
to the endowment of a division of educational inquiry. In his letter 
to the trustees, announcing the benefaction, he says: 
It shall be the function of the division of educational inquiry to conduct studies 
and to make investigations concerning universities, colleges, professional schools, and 
systems of education generally, to investigate problems of education affecting the 
improvement of educational methods, the advancement of teaching, or betterment of 
educational standards, and in general to investigate and to report upon those educa- 
tional agencies which undertake to deal with the intellectual, social, and moral prog- 
ress of mankind and to publish such results as the trustees may consider of value. 
JOHN F. SLATER FUND. 
The annual meeting of the trustees of the John F. Slater Fund was 
held in New York City, April 23, 1913. Director James H. Dillard, 
in his report of the work of the fund for the current year, presented 
a statement showing the amounts appropriated during the past 30 
years to various institutions. It was recommended and adopted 
that the sum of $69,250 be appropriated for the fiscal year 1913-14. 
The director was authorized ‘‘to use interchangeably the appropria- 
tions for next year for county training schools, summer schools, and 
extension work.’’ The new plan of the county teacher-training 
schools for negroes, to be established under the auspices of the 
Slater Fund, has attracted the attention of county superintendents 
in the South. Seven of these schools have thus far been instituted. 
The only two conditions on which the Slater board makes appropria- 
tions for such schools is that the property shall belong to the county, 
in other words that they shall be regular public schools; and secondly 
that the county shall guarantee a fair support. While not dictating 
how the Slater appropriation shall be spent, it is usually understood 
that it goes for the promotion of industrial training, so that teachers 
trained in these schools may be prepared to teach industrial occu- 
pations in the small country schools in which they may work.

    556 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
SOUTHERN EDUCATION BOARD. 
During the current year the funds of the Southern Education 
Board have been appropriated to State boards and State depart- 
ments of education, to be used largely in paying the salaries and 
expenses of State supervisors of rural schools and State organizers 
of school improvement work. Contributions have been made to 
Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. In addition, 
appropriations have been made to Alabama, Arkansas, and North 
Carolina, for aiding in educational campaigns. 
The Peabody Education Fund has appropriated funds to Alabama, 
Arkansas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia 
for similar purposes. The general administration of both Rave has 
been centered in one office, located in Washington, D. C. 
The State supervisors of rural schools are appointed by the State 
superintendents, and, when necessary, confirmed by the State boards 
of education, so that they are members of the State superintendents’ 
cabinets, with all the powers and responsibilities belonging to such 
positions. Their work is done under the general supervision of the 
State departments of education, and their entire time is devoted to the 
building up of the rural schools in the States. It is owing largely 
to the earnest efforts of the State supervisors that tendencies in the 
public-school system of the Southern States are now integrating, 
instead of disintegrating, as they were for many years. The people 
are bringing the little schools together, making at least the beginnings 
of centers for rural culture. 
The State super visors report monthly to the ddepak tments of educa- 
tion, and copies of these reports are sent to the office of the Southern 
Education Board in Washington. Summaries of these reports are 
then prepared and manifolded, copies of which are mailed to the 
workers in each State. In this manner any’significant development 
in one State is reported at once to all the other States. The office 
is a center for collecting and distributing information from every 
possible source bearing directly upon rural school progress. 
The State supervisors have a permanent organization and they 
meet annually in connection with the Conference for Education in 
the South. 
THE PHELPS-STOKES FUND. 
The Phelps-Stokes Fund is the residuary estate, amounting to 
about $1,000,000, bequeathed by Miss Caroline Phelps Stokes, of 
New York City, for various philanthropic purposes, among which 
is the education of negroes. Most of the appropriations made up 
to date have contributed directly or indirectly to a clearer knowledge 
of colored schools. With the cooperation of the Phelps-Stokes Fund,
-P-A-G-E-611
  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 557 
the Bureau of Education is now making a comprehensive study of 
the private and higher schools for colored people. This study is 
undertaken in response to numerous and insistent demands for 
knowledge of these schools, the number of which is constantly in- 
creasing. When sufficient data have been collected a report will be 
printed and published giving a brief, but accurate, survey of each 
school, of its equipment, its work, and its place in the educational 
system of the city, county, or State in which it is located. 
Il. EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The fifty-first annual meeting of the National Education Associa- 
tion of the United States was held in Salt Lake City, Utah, July 5-12, 
1913. In his presidential address Dr. Edward T. Fairchild discussed 
the future of the association. He recommended the creation of an 
advisory council, consisting of three persons, two of whom selected 
by the directors or by the trustees, should serve for a term of years. 
The third member should be the president of the association ex officio. 
“The appointed members should be eminent, constructive educators, 
endowed with the true spirit of research. The salary should be com- 
mensurate with the importance and responsibility of the work, and 
such as would enable them to give their entire time to the duties com- 
mitted to their care.” A number of interesting papers were read, 
among them ‘‘The schoolhouse evening center—what it is, what it 
costs, and what it pays,”’ by Lee F. Hanmer; ‘‘The new rural school,” 
by Neil C. Macdonald; and ‘‘The teaching of civics in elementary 
and secondary schools,’ by J. Lynn Barnard. Dr. Thomas Jesse 
Jones, of the United States Bureau of Education, presented a paper 
on the ‘‘High school and democracy.” Dr. P. P. Claxton, United 
States Commissioner of Education, delivered an address on the work 
of the Bureau of Education. 
The various departments of the association held interesting meet- 
ings for the discussion of the many educational activities assigned to 
them, as follows: Kindergarten education, elementary education, 
secondary education, higher education, normal schools, manual 
training and art education, music, business education, child hygiene, 
physical education, science instruction, school administration, library 
economy, special education, school patrons, rural and agricultural 
education. 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE, 
The Department of Superintendence met in Philadelphia, Pa., 
February 26-28, 1913, President Franklin B. Dyer, superintendent of 
schools, Boston, Mass., presiding. Many important papers were read
-P-A-G-E-612
    
558 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
and reports of committees submitted. The report of the committee 
on economy of time in elementary education was presented in sey- 
eral sections: (A) Report on progress by the committee on economy 
of time in elementary and secondary education, by H. B. Wilson; 
(B) A seven-year elementary school, by Charles H. Judd; (C) Mobility 
of the teaching population in relation to economy of time, by Lotus 
D. Coffman; (DP) The economy of time through testing the course of 
study and time allotment, by Leonard P. Ayres. 
One of the most valuable reports was that of the joint committee 
on grammatical nomenclature, since completed and published. The 
purpose of the system of nomenclature recommended by the com- 
mittee is to clear the way for the intelligent study of the field with 
which it deals—the relations of thought as seen in language. 
The topic “improving school systems by scientific management” 
was discussed by Supt. F. E. Spaulding and Profs. Paul H. Hanus 
and A. Duncan Yocum. Supt. Spaulding presented a number of 
graphic statistical charts showing results obtained in the schools of 
Newton, Mass. 
Resolutions were passed indorsing differentiation in courses of 
study in the last two years of grammar-school work; advocating 
wider use of the school plant for educational, social, and civic pur- 
poses; and the development and encouragement of industrial and 
vocational education. 
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION, 
The National Council met in Philadelphia, Pa., February 24-28, 
1913. The topic for consideration at the opening session was ‘‘The 
reorganization of the teaching profession.’’ The general presenta- 
tion of the subject was made by Prof. Henry Suzzalo. Dr. Thomas 
D. Wood, chairman of the joint committee on health problems in 
education, presented a report on ‘‘The sanitation of rural schools,” 
in which he declared that the majority of the rural schoolhouses are 
unfit for use because of insanitary conditions. 
The report of the committee on tests and standards of efficiency in 
schools and school systems was made by Prof. George D. Strayer, 
chairman. He urged the importance of appointing a committee or 
commission on school efficiency whose functions should be to offer 
encouragement, expert advice, and opportunity for publication to 
those engaged in scientific work in the direction of the derivation of 
scales of measurements.* 
A resolution was adopted approving the above recommendations, 
and a committee of 15 members was appointed.

REPORT OF SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
Ann Arpor, Miou., August 30, 1913. 
Sir: Complying with the provisions of section 4 of the act of incor- 
poration of the National Education Association by Congress, approved 
June 30, 1906, the following is submitted as an annual report: 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington at 662 
E Street NE., in accordance with section 8 of the act of incorpora- 
tion, but the association owns no property, real or personal, in the 
city of Washington. 
The personal property of the association is largely in the form of 
volumes of proceedings, pamphlets, reprints, and office furniture, 
worth about $12,000, all of which is in the custody of thesecretary, 
in Ann Arbor, Mich., where the business of the association is trans- 
acted. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in 
section 7 of the act of incorporation, which is in charge of the board 
of trustees. This fund at the close of the fiscal year, June 30, 1913, 
amounted to $188,000. The net revenue from this fund amounted 
to $6,932.63, which was transferred to the treasury of the associa- 
tion for current expenses. 
During the fiscal year ended July 1, 1913, the total receipts from 
all sources, including balance at the beginning, were $50,277.26; the 
total expenses were $47,984.76; the balance in the treasury June 30, 
1913, was $2,292.50. 
The chief sources of revenue are membership fees, proceeds of sale 
of volumes and reports, and income from the invested fund. 
The chief items of expense are the printing and distribution of the 
annual volumes, the maintenance of the secretary’s office, and the 
expense of preparing for and conducting the annual convention. 
The usual appropriations for educational investigations were made 
at the time of the convention, which was held in Salt Lake City, 
Utah, July 5-12, 1913. 
The general sessions and the sessions of the departments were well 
attended, and the programs presented were of the usual standard 
of excellence. 
The following general officers were elected for the ensuing year: 
President, Joseph Swain, of Swarthmore, Pa.; vice president, Edward 
T. Fairchild, of Durham, N. H.; treasurer, Grace M. Shepherd, of 
Boise, Idaho. . 
The executive committee for the ensuing year will be constituted 
as follows: President, Joseph Swain, president of Swarthmore College, 
Swarthmore, Pa.; first vice president, Edward T. Fairchild, president 
of New Hampshire College, Durham, N. H.; treasurer, Grace M. 
Shepherd, State superintendent of public instruction, Boise, Idaho;

AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF INSTRUCTION. 
Making no pretense of rivaling other organizations in attendance 
and other external features, the American Institute of Instruction 
exerts an influence on educational thought not surpassed by any 
other educational organization. The eighty-second annual meeting, 
held at Bethlehem, N. H., July 1-4, 1913, touched in a vital way 
most of the important phases of education. Dr. David Snedden, 
commissioner of education for Massachusetts, delivered a careful 
statement on increasing the efficiency of education. 
Other addresses were: “Professional cooperation,’ by State 
Superintendent Henry C. Morrison, of New Hampshire; “Mechanieal 
drill as a means to intelleetual freedom,” by Prof. A. Duncan Yocum, 
of the University of Pennsylvania; “The duty of the school to arouse 
a sense of responsibility in the home,” by Supt. Franklin B. Dyer, of 
Boston. 
CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
The sixteenth Conference for Educatton in the South, held at 
Richmond, Va., April 15-18, 1913, was memorable for its emphasis 
on the principle of cooperation. Farmers, business men, and edu- 
cators met separately and together to discuss methods of community 
betterment. The farmers’ conference discussed organized cooperative 
buying and selling and cooperative local credit associations; the 
 
-P-A-G-E-615
    EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 561 
business men’s conference discussed the farm situation in the South, 
the marketing of cotton, the social needs of farm life, the assistance of 
commercial bodies or towns in efforts for farm development. The 
women’s conference discussed the education of women in the country. 
There was also a conference on the country church and a conference on 
taxation. In the evening meetings there were addresses by Henry 
Exall, of Dallas, Tex., on ‘Man and the land”’; by L. E. Johnson, presi- 
dent of the Norfolk & Western Railway, on “The rural problem from 
the standpoint of a railroad president”’; while Charles Lee Raper, of » 
the University of North Carolina, discussed ‘Taxation: The effective- 
ness and justice of government in the Southern States.” One 
evening was given to farm-demonstration work in the South. The 
final evening was devoted to three main topics: Rural-school work in 
the South, high-school work in the South, and health work in the 
South. 
In summarizing the work of the conference, Ambassador Walter 
Hines Page, who presided over the sessions, declared: 
The historian of the progress of democracy could not write a more thrilling chapter 
than the events of the past 10 or 15 years, taking as the cue the note of the Conference 
for Education in the South. We began with the school and the child and we end 
with them, of course; but every step has been toward a widening democratic ideal, 
to see how we could teach one another, and we have come to have a broadening sense 
of all that cooperation means. 
Robert C. Ogden, president of the conference, and for many years 
a noted leader in educational work in the South, died in New York 
City August 7, 1913. 
SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The twenty-third annual meeting of the Southern Educational 
Association was held at Louisville, Ky., November 28-30, 1912. 
Dr. H. L. Whitfield presented a discussion of the high-school situa- 
tion of the South. W. E. Halbrook read a paper on ‘Training 
for cooperative and systematic activities in the rural schools.” The 
third session was devoted largely to discussions of rural education. 
Dr. Charles C. Thach delivered an address on ‘Training for life 
work in our rural schools.’”’ Dr. Claxton, United States Commissioner 
of Education, declared that the fundamental problem of education 
in the South was the democracy of occupations. ‘If vocations are 
equally honored because they equally serve the community, we will 
have the right principle of education.” The final session of the 
association was devoted to a paper by Hon. M. P. Shawkey on the 
“Public school and efficiency.” 
Resolutions were adopted urging the right kind of education for 
the southern negro, so ‘‘that he may not be a menace to society;” 
the better education of the farmer’s child by relating his school to

his environment; the education of girls in practical studies; and the 
payment of equal salaries to men and women teachers for equal 
service. 
CATHOLIC EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The tenth annual meeting of the Catholic Educational Association 
was held in New Orleans, La., June 30-July 3, 1913. The secretary- 
general in his report to the executive board, discussing the work of 
the association, laid stress on the fact that the problem of the curricu- 
lum is the focal point of interest. 
A resolution was adopted at the meeting protesting against and 
condemning as— 
subversive of true morality, the imparting of sexual knowledge to children as at present 
carried on in many private and public schools in the country. 
Notable addresses were made by Rt. Rey. Monsignor T, J. Shahan, 
of the Catholic University of America, on ‘‘The teaching office of 
the Catholic church;’ Rev. Francis W. Howard, on ‘‘The problem 
of the curriculum;”’ and Rey. Albert Muntoch, S. J., on ‘‘ Vocational 
guidance.” In dealing with the problem of the curriculum, Rev. F. W. 
Howard declared that Catholic educators were confronted with several 
different lines of action, which he enumerated as follows: 
1. Shall we conform to the secular system in subjects, textbooks, arrangement 
of courses, grading, and adjustment of the various departments of the system, with 
the addition of religious instruction, and Catholic philosophy? 
2. Shall we endeavor to arrange our work in entire independence of the State system? 
3. Shall we endeavor to make a systematic study of present conditions, inquire into 
the causes of present confusion, and endeavor to formulate the principles of some 
sound system of Christian education, that will be in substantial accord with the reasona- 
ple features of the secular education of the day, and at the same time insure us a mod- 
erate and reasonable measure of independence? 
By adopting the first, we face gradual extinction; the second is impossible for us, 
and the most prudent thing for us to do is to adopt the third plan outlined. 
NATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ASSOCIATION. 
The organization meeting of the National Vocational Guidance 
Association was held at Grand Rapids, Mich., October 21-23. This 
was the third national conference on vocational guidance, previous 
meetings having been held at Boston in 1910 and at New York City 
in 1912. In a session devoted to ‘‘the larger social, economic, and 
educational bearings of vocational guidance,” Owen Lovejoy dis- 
cussed ‘‘vocational guidance and child labor.’’ He urged that the 
child’s future usefulness, not the present balance sheet should be the 
measure of the success of guidance into vocations. In showing 
results of recent studies of the Russell Sage Foundation, Leonard P. 
Ayres stressed the need for a fact basis for work in vocational guid- 
ance; the need for careful study of vocations to determine constancy
-P-A-G-E-617
  EDUCATIONAL’ ASSOCIATIONS. 563 
and other factors in employment. Prof. George H. Mead, of the 
University of Chicago, analyzed critically current educational con- 
ditions. Meyer Bloomfield, director of the Vocation Bureau of Bos- 
ton, described some of the lessons Europe has for the United States; 
Prof. Frederick G. Bonser, of Teachers College, Columbia University, 
urged the necessity of professional training for vocational counseling; 
and Helen T. Woolley, of Cincinnati, traced the history of the voca- 
tional guidance movement. One session was devoted to vocational 
guidance within the public school system. Alfred P. Fletcher, of 
Rochester, N. Y., attempted to answer four questions: (1) Is voca- 
tional guidance needed, and if so, what kind? (2) How can that 
vocational guidance be given? (8) Can it be given by means of 
differentiated courses of study? (4) How should such courses be 
organized? IF. M. Giles, of DeKalb, Ill., described his attempt to 
introduce guidance in a town of 10,000 people by courses of instruc- 
tion in vocational opportunities and personal characteristics. 
Sophonisba P. Breckenridge, of Chicago, and Charles Marten, of the 
Jewish Orphan Asylum, Cleveland, discussed the problem from the 
point of view of placement and follow-up work. Asst. Supt. E. D. 
Roberts, of Cincinnati, described the continuation schools of Cincin- 
nati as a means of vocational guidance. 
In a joint session with the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education on the topic, ‘“How shall we study an industry 
for purpose of vocational education and vocational guidance?’ 
Charles R. Richards, director of Cooper Union, illustrated graphically 
three typical cases where skill and technical knowledge are required 
in varying degrees; Frank M. Leavitt, of the University of Chicago, 
emphasized the point that whatever may be of importance for 
vocational education, from the standpoint of vocational guidance 
the prime factor will always be the child, ‘‘whose rights will be placed 
above, far above those of property or the dictates of educational 
tradition.” 
AMERICAN SCHOOL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION. 
American School Hygiene Association met with the International 
Congress of School Hygiene, held at Buffalo, N. Y., August 25-30, 
1913, at which meeting every phase 6f the health movement as related. 
to education received both general and special treatment in large 
meetings and in smaller discussion sections. Topics of the various 
sessions included: School buildings and their equipment; fatigue and 
nervousness in school children; exciting and contributory causes of 
disease and physical defects in school children; child labor; status 
of school hygiene and methods of instruction in city, village, and 
country schools; open-air schools; instruction in hygiene; mental 
hygiene; mouth hygiene; ventilation, heating, and cleaning of school

buildings; mental hygiene and the hygiene of the mentally abnormal 
child; medical inspection; play and athletics; health supervision of 
college and university students; crippled children; conservation of 
vision; the Binet-Simon scale; school illumination; school hygiene in 
relation to the home and the community; school feeding; tubercu- 
losis among school children; women’s clubs in relation to school 
hygiene; school nurses and school clinics. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE UNIVERSITIES. 
The seventeenth annual meeting of the National Association of 
State Universities convened at Washington, D. C., November, 1912. 
The standing committee on the national university recommended most 
strongly that the agitation for such a university be kept up as 
“steadily and persistently as may be until the movement is crowned 
with success.’ The report of the committee on the reorganization 
of education evoked much interest and discussion. Prof. Charles 
Hughes Johnson, of the University of Kansas, read a paper on ‘‘Some 
problems of per capita cost of university education,” which he illus- 
trated. with graphic statistical charts. Dr. P. P. Claxton, United 
States Commissioner of Education, speaking of the mission of the 
State university, said: 
The State universities owe it to themselves and to the people whom they serve and 
who support them to build up good public high schools with four-year courses in all 
parts of these States. All State universities and all institutions conferring academic 
degrees should do the same grade of work and require the same standards for admis- 
sion and graduation. 
Dr. R. M. Hughes, acting president of Miami University, presented a 
paper on ‘‘The right of college fraternities to exist in a State-supported 
institution.” President Charles R. Van Hise, of the University of 
Wisconsin, spoke on the subject of ‘‘Self-government at the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin,” citing the fact that one of the incidental effects 
of such self-government was to improve the relations of the students 
and the faculty. President Alston Ellis, of Ohio University, read a 
paper on ‘‘Minimum credits for the bachelor’s degree.” 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS OF COLLEGES 
AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The sixth conference of the national conference committee on 
standards of colleges and secondary schools was held in New York City 
February 19, 1913. Delegates from the following associations were 
present: College Entrance Examination Board, the New England 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, the New England 
College Entrance Certificate Board, the Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, the North 
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Carnegie

    EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 565 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the Bureau of 
Education. A subcommittee reported the results of an investiga- 
tion of the use of the terms “honorable dismissal” and “statement of 
record,” based upon returns from a questionnaire sent to 80 col- 
leges and universities. A resolution was passed defining the proper 
use of these terms, as follows: 
Resolved, that the term ‘‘honorable dismissal” should be used to refer to conduct 
and character only, and that honorable dismissal should never be given unless the 
student’s standing as to conduct and character is such as to entitle him to continu- 
ance in the institution granting the dismissal * * * That the term “statement. 
of record” should be used to refer to the recorded results of a student’s work in the 
classroom, and that this statement should in every instance contain all the important 
facts pertaining to the student’s admission, classification, and scholarship. 
The conference passed the following resolution regarding the term 
“unit,” after receiving a report from the above subcommittee, re- 
viewing some of the difficulties discovered in the application of the 
definition of the unit adopted at the meeting on October 9, 1910: 
A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting 
approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. 
This statement is designed to afford a standard of measurement for the work done 
in secondary schools. It takes the four-year high-school course’as a basis, and assumes 
that the length of the school year is from 36 to 40 weeks, that a period is from 40 to 60 
minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for 4 or 5 periods a week; but, under 
ordinary circumstances, a satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accom- 
plished in less than 120 sixty-minute hours or their equivalent. Schools organized 
on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of 
this unit. 
A four-year secondary school curriculum should be regarded as representing not 
more than 16 units of work. 
NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
The eighteenth annual meeting of the North Central Association 
of Colleges and Secondary Schools was held in Chicago, March 21-22, 
1913. The presidential address, by W. J. S. Bryan, contained a 
brief synopsis of secondary education in England and on the Conti- 
nent. Dr. Kendric C. Babcock, of the Bureau of Education, read a 
paper on ‘The naming of an approved list of colleges.’’ Prof. Frank 
M. Leavitt, treating the subject of sanity in industrial education, - 
said that inasmuch as 74 per cent of the pupils in the United States 
do not reach the high school, sanity in industrial training will demand 
that “it strike its roots deep down into the elementary school.” 
A committee was appointed to investigate experiments in sec- 
ondary education involving changes in time schedules of day and 
year and in grouping of years to form intermediate schools or junior 
high schools of grades of 7, 8, 9, and 10, and senior high schools of 
grades 11 and 12 and the freshman and sophomore years in college,

and to suggest measures to be taken for the evaluation of the subjects 
of the secondary curriculum. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE 
MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND, 
The twenty-sixth annual convention of the Association of Col- 
leges and Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland 
was held at Philadelphia, Pa., November 29-30, 1912. The general 
topic of the first session was ‘‘The comprehensive examination,” 
which received elaborate treatment in two papers, the first by Presi- 
dent A. Lawrence Lowell, of Harvard University, and the second by 
Dr. E. J. Goodwin, of Packer Collegiate Institute, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
At the second session Prof. James E. Russell discussed ‘‘ Professional 
factors in the training of the high-school teacher,” declaring that the 
vital need to-day in the development of professional training for 
high-school teachers is the cooperation of the colleges and the schools— 
of the colleges by way of making suitable preparation for profes- 
sional study, and of the schools by way of providing adequate means 
for giving apprentice training under competent guidance. Com- 
missioner Calvin N. Kendall, of New Jersey, discussed ‘‘The training 
of high-school teachers.” 
The third session of the convention was devoted to an address by | 
the president, Supt. W. H. Maxwell, of New York City, whose topic 
was, ‘‘The attitude of the American parent toward education.” 
There were round-table conferences on ancient languages, biology, 
commercial education, modern languages, and school and college 
libraries. In connection with the meeting of the association there 
were meetings of the following affiliated bodies: College conference on 
English in the Central Atlantic States, Association of History Teachers 
of the Middle States and Maryland, and Association of Teachers of 
Mathematics of the Middle States and Maryland. 
NEW ENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS. 
The twenty-eighth annual meeting of the New England Associa- 
tion of Colleges and Preparatory Schools was held in Cambridge, 
Mass., October 31-November 1, 1913. Symposiums were held on 
preparation for teaching in secondary schools and measurements of 
efficiency in instruction, which were participated in by Chancellor 
Elmer E. Brown, of New York University, Prof. Raymond Mac- 
Farland, William Orr, President A. Lawrence Lowell, of Harvard 
University, Frank E. Spaulding, and Prof. George D. Strayer.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN RELATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. 
At the twenty-fifth annual conference of the University of Chicago 
with cooperating secondary schools, held on April 18-19, 1913, the 
theme of the general sessions and the departmental conferences was 
“Economy in education.” In the conference on biology it was the 
consensus of opinion that the high-school courses in botany and 
zoology should be considerably changed, and that the high-school 
teachers need a different viewpoint. Mr. Whitbeck, in the conference 
on earth science, presented statistics regarding instruction in geog- 
raphy in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio, which indicated 
that geography and physiography are mostly taught by persons 
without any special training in those lines. 
The home economies section passed the following resolutions: 
(1) That there is need of more definite formulation of high-school courses in the 
belief that if the need of the high-school girl is really met there will be no duplica- 
tion in college. (2) That a general science course in the first year of high school is 
desirable for students of home economies. 
The articulation of high-school manual arts courses with general 
college work was the subject discussed by the manual arts conference. 
WESTERN DRAWING AND MANUAL TRAINING ASSOCIATION, 
The twentieth annual meeting of the Western Drawing and Manual 
Training Association was held at Des Moines, Iowa, May 7-10, 1913. 
A report of the international congress for art education, at Dresden, 
was given by Nama A. Lathe. Henry Turner Bailey presented some 
of the advantages of attending the international congress to be held 
in Paris, 1916. Miss Florence Ward discussed ‘‘The place of art and 
handwork in the Montessori system.’ ‘‘Vocational education in 
rural schools’’ was the subject of a paper by G. M. Wilson. 
MUSIC TEACHERS’ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-fourth annual meeting of the Music Teachers’ National 
Association was held in Poughkeepsie, N. Y., December 30, 1912, to 
January 2, 1913. A number of interesting papers were read at the 
sessions, notably one on ‘‘New lights on Beethoven from his conver- 
sation books,” by Henry E. Krehbiel, of New York, based upon | 
fresh researches now going forward. The history of the organization 
of the American College of Musicians was presented by Prof. E. M. 
Bowman. The association, according to custom, held a joint session 
with the American section of the International Musical Society, at 
which Prof. Charles H. Mills discussed the history of music degrees, 
giving the history of such degrees at the English, Scotch, and Irish 
universities.

AMERICAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The twentieth annual convention of the American Physical Edu- 
cation Association was held in Newark, N. J., March 26-27, 1913. 
The presidential address was delivered by Dr. R. T. McKenzie, who 
spoke on ‘‘The quest for Eldorado.” Dr. Henry H. Goddard made 
an address on ‘‘Heredity in relation to efficiency,’ illustrated by 
graphic charts. The subject of ‘“New efficiency methods for training 
the posture of school children,” was discussed by Miss Jessie H. 
Bancroft, who showed the results accomplished in the public ele- 
mentary schools of Brooklyn, N. Y. Miss Lillian L. Kuester read a 
paper on ‘‘Medical gymnastics as related to college life,” based. upon 
data taken from two years’ physical examinations of entering stu- 
dents at Mount Holyoke College. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS. 
The thirteenth annual meeting of the Association of American Law 
Schools was held at Montreal, Canada, September 1-3, 1913. An 
address on ‘The teaching of practice and procedure in law schools” 
was delivered by Edson R. Sunderland, who dwelt on the striking and 
far-reaching difference in the functions of the colleges of liberal arts 
and the professional schools. He said: . 
The gradually increasing entrance requirements among the better professional 
schools mean nothing else than a recognition of the truth that such schools are not a 
part of the general educational system, but are institutions into which the already 
educated man comes for special training to fit him for a special service. 
A joint meeting of the association and the sections of legal educa+ 
tion of the American Bar Association was held on September 31, on 
which occasion former President of the United States William H. 
Taft gave an able presentation of ‘‘The social importance of proper 
standards for admission to the bar.’’ Among other things he advo- 
cated a close study of the science of general and sociological juris- 
prudence as a basis for the study of the various branches of the law. 
The following resolution was adopted by the association: 
Resolved, That in the opinion of the Association of American Law Schools the pres- 
ent and future responsibilities of the American legal profession require that the prep- 
aration for admission should include at least one or two years of training of a college 
grade prior to beginning the study of law; and voted, that the president and secretary 
of this association are instructed to transmit a copy of this resolution to the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court, the chairman of the board of bar examiners, and the 
president of the bar association in each State and Territory, requesting them to use 
their efforts to bring about such a requirement for admission to the bar in their juris- 
dictions.

AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ARTS. 
The fourth annual convention of the American Federation of Arts 
was held in Washington, May 15-16, 1913. Two general topics were 
selected for discussion: ‘‘Small art museums” and ‘‘Industrial art.” 
The secretary’s statement gave the total number of chapters of the 
federation as 181; 22 traveling exhibitions, which had been shown in 
95. places, were reported during the past year. In addition to the 
publication of Art and Progress, the federation assumed the publica- 
tion of the American Art Annual and Who's Who in Art. Mr. de 
Forest, in his presidential address, urged the value of concentrating 
the work of the federation, and developing and perfecting its present 
activities—the traveling exhibits, lectures, etc. In discussing the 
“Small art museums,’ H. W. Kent, assistant secretary of the Metro- 
politan Museum of Art, in New York City, gave an interesting his- 
torical review of the origin and evolution of the modern small museum, 
and described the important réle museums have played in the indus- 
trial development of European countries, and how they may be 
encouraged in the United States. Raymond Wyer, director of the 
Hackley Art Gallery, of Muskegon, Mich., spoke of the importance 
of the museum as an adjunct to the educational system of a com- 
munity in inculcating appreciation of the higher aspects of art. A 
paper by Ralph A. Cram on ‘‘Industrial art” advocated a revival of 
the artistic spirit of the Middle Ages and dwelt on the importance to 
the future of American art and civilization in teaching the designer 
and industrial artist to be industrial workers as well; to engage in the 
actual production of the things they design. Howard Walker’s 
paper on the ‘‘Relation of industrial art to education” laid emphasis 
on the value and importance of teaching children the elementary 
principles of design and artistic treatment while they are young. 
An instructive exhibit of industrial art, designed to illustrate Mr. 
Walker’s address, comprised several hundred specimens of American 
handicraft, including the productions of students in public schools 
and colleges, etc. It consisted of work in silver, wood-carving, 
textiles, advertising, printing, and every branch of ceramics. 
Resolutions were adopted declaring the federation in favor of the 
creation of State art commissions, and authorizing the appointment 
of a committee to investigate the question of recommending to Con- 
gress the creation of a department of art in the Government. 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS IN COLORED SCHOOLS. 
The tenth annual session of the National Association of Teachers 
in Colored Schools was held in Little Rock, Ark., Juiy 30-August 3, 
1913. The more intimate and vital problems of negro education are 
discussed at these meetings. Reports were made of the best public  
-P-A-G-E-624

school work accomplished in rural sections of the South. Leo M. 
Favrot, State supervisor of colored schools for Arkansas, delivered 
one of the notable addresses of the occasion. A council of school 
presidents was formed as a department of the association. 
AMERICAN PEACE CONGRESS. 
The fourth American Peace Congress met in St. Louis, Mo., May 
1-3, 1913. It was a notable gathering of the heads of peace societies, 
arbitration leagues, and international unions. 
One section meeting was devoted to the universities and the peace 
movement, Louis P. Lochner speaking on “Internationalism among 
universities,” and Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews on the “Progress of the 
peace movement through education.” 
LAKE MOHONK CONFERENCE. 
The thirty-first conference of friends of the Indians and other de- 
pendent peoples was held at Mohonk Lake, N. Y., October 22-24, 
1913.. Dr. Elmer E. Brown, former United States Commissioner of 
Education, presided at the sessions. The first day was devoted to 
Indian affairs, the second to the Philippines, and the third to Porto 
Rico, etc. The need for more schools and compulsory attendance 
among the Indians was urged by H. B. Peairs, general superintendent 
of Indian schools, who also made a plea for the training of deficient 
and defective children, for whom there is no place in the present

Columbia University, outlined the school work in the Philippine 
Islands. The principal address on Porto Rico was by Rt. Rev. 
James H. Van Buren, formerly Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Porto 
Rico. 
CHINESE INDEMNITY STUDENTS. 
According to the Chinese Educational Mission, there are at present 
237 Chinese students in the United States maintained from the in-

EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRIS- 
TIAN ASSOCIATIONS.

  I. BRIEF HISTORY. 
1. Early antecedents—From the very inception of the Young 
Men’s Christian Association some educational features have been con- 
nected with its development. To understand its introduction it 
seems desirable for us to glance back into the seventeenth century. 
As early as 1694 there were “ mutual improvement societies ” in which 
some of our present general types of educational work were carried 
on in both America and England. From 1800 to 1850 numerous 
“mechanic’s institutes” flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, with 
strong organizations, sufficient funds, and most laudable objects— 
“To diffuse knowledge and information throughout the niechanic 
classes, found lectures on mechanical, chemical, and science subjects, 
create libraries and museums, and establish schools for their growth.” 
Scarcely a trace of them remains, 
Large numbers of societies of young men for mutual development 
have flourished and almost as speedily have died. The experience of 
the past 200 years seems to indicate that “ voluntary efforts to pro- 
mote the moral and intellectual life of young men by organizations 
or societies which set aside the spiritual have greatly disappointed 
their promotors.” Amid the network of such organizations the 
Young Men’s Christian Association was born in London in 1844. It 
was but natural that some of the educational activities of the co- 
existing societies should be introduced into association efforts. 
2. In London.—In the parent association in London the first edu- 
cational feature recorded is that of the Exeter Hall lecture course in 
1845. Although begun with the sole idea of benefiting men spirit- 
ually, the London association at its regular semiannual meeting in 
December, 1845, reported the organization and conduct during that 
573  
-P-A-G-E-628
  
  574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
fall and winter of the Exeter Hall educational lectures and the for- 
mation of mutual improvement or literary societies, “In order to 
bring under the influence of the association young men who could not 
be reached by the directly religious agencies.” Four years later 
library and reading-room facilities began to be provided. Class 
work privileges were not organized until 1853. The recorded senti- 
ment of the committee in starting the work is as true to-day as then: 
We desired to provide for the members and their friends all that could tend 
to the enlargement of the mind, the cultivation of the judgment, and the conse- 
eration of the heart. 
In this connection we note, first, the primary object in founding 
the association was the religious life of men; second, the first efforts 
to help men in daily life were educational, including lectures, clubs, 
reading rooms, libraries, ‘and class work; third, earnest care was 
taken in all these steps that these so-called secular agencies be kept 
- closely as auxiliaries to, not substitutes for, the main cbject of the 
association. 
While some excellent service has been rendered in many associa- 
tions in England and Scotland, and in continental Europe, compara- 
tively little effort has been made to extend the educational work of 
the many English, German, and French associations. The result is 
that other organizations, such as polytechnics and various kinds of 
institutes, have occupied the field and are doing splendid service. 
The Young Men’s Christian Associations have thus lost a large meas- 
ure of their educational opportunities during the past 60 years. 
3. In North America—(a) 1851-1866; the period of apathy. The 
first North American associations were organized in 1851, at Montreal 
and Boston. Little available material is found in written records 
concerning the work for the first 15 years of its growth. In August, 
1855, the report of the world’s conference at Paris states that educa- 
tional facilities were offered to some extent in a few associations of 
America, as well as in those in England, and that they comprised 
libraries, literary societies, reading rooms, lectures, and a few even- 
ing classes in Greek, music, and arithmetic. Some of these features 
were reported from Boston, Montreal, and New York. 
Little effort was made to help men by educational work until 35 
years after the planting of the association on American soil—until 
after the first generation of its American founders and promoters 
had passed away. It appears that during those early years the zeal 
of the American leaders for the religious work was very prominent, 
and they feared that the so-called secular features might choke or 
destroy the religious influence of the association. They did not, 
therefore, encourage educational work. 
At the New Orleans convention in 1860 there were reported 48 
libraries, 88 reading rooms, 18 literary societies, language and music
-P-A-G-E-629
THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS, 575 
classes, evening and mission schools. There were more classes in 
music, Greek, and Latin than in all other subjects combined. Much 
emphasis was given to the work of the literary societies. In 1866 the 
records show that four associations in America reported 60 students 
in class work. 
(6) 1866-1880; the period of toleration. For the most part the 
various educational features were regarded as side issues of the asso- 
ciation and were left to take care of themselves. Educational work 
was neither promoted nor encouraged. Records show a slow but 
steady growth in the number of reading rooms, libraries, lectures, 
and a few literary societies. Class work was very largely confined 
to a study of the dead languages and often limited to divinity stu- 
dents. The association has always strongly encouraged the work and 
preparation of men for the ministry. 
With the beginning of the four-fold work in the New York asso- 
ciation building in 1870, under the leadership of Mr. Robert R. Mc- 
Burney, the first visible signs appeared of definite plans in building 
and equipment for association work. This building was the first 
one in the world designed with any special reference to association 
service. It provided a large room well located for use as a library, 
and for 30 years that association library exerted a very large and 
helpful influence in New York among students and men of all classes. 
It also provided splendid quarters for its literary society and for 
other forms of educational club work, and there were two or three 
rooms especially for evening classes. 
Gradually the conception grew that the most efficient association 
work as a whole was for the development of the all-round man— 
spiritual, educational, physical, and social. Similarly there followed 
the conception that the educational work for boys and men should 
supplement the existing educational privileges of a community, plac- 
ing emphasis upon: (1) The use of the reading room with its stand- 
ard periodicals, (2) cultivating the habit of reading good books in 
the library, (3) promoting literary societies and all forms of educa- 
tional clubs, (4) developing the educational lectures and practical 
talks, and (5) conducting such appropriate practical class work as 
was needed to meet the needs or desires of men and boys in their 
leisure hours. 
(c) 1880-1893; the period of awakening and new interest. Some 
effort toward encouraging the work in various directions began to be 
seen. Educational work, however, simply existed, waiting for its 
value to be appreciated and for steps to be taken to develop and en- 
courage it. The subject first appeared at State conventions in 1887, 
when some emphasis was placed upon its definite promotion and its 
more dignified conduct by local associations, as an opportunity for 
jarger service, as a responsibility to men and the community, and as 
 
-P-A-G-E-630
  576 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
a source of large dividends in the promotion of character building. 
In 1889 the subject of association educational work for the first time 
came before the international convention. A number of leaders 
with wisdom and foresight began to encourage the definite and 
systematic promotion of this work. By the end of this period (i. e., 
1893) the majority of the associations had libraries and reading 
rooms, a number conducted societies and lectures, and over 100 re- 
ported evening classes, with a total of over 10,000 different men as 
students. - Increasing attention was given to these features each year. 
The “ practical talk” was introduced with much success. Educa- 
tional clubs were expanded in variety and novelty. Class work was 
developed in commercial and language subjects, A beginning was 
. seen in industrial and scientific subjects during the last year or two 
of this period. 
(d) 1893-1900; the period of encouragement. At the beginning of 
this period of encouragement and development of the work as a 
whole, the international committee added a department of its service 
with an educational secretary to promote appropriate educational 
work among the several associations. Principles were studied, ex- 
perience of all forms of supplementary educational work were gath- 
ered, and suggestions were drawn for the benefit of the associations. 
An advanced step was taken when a few associations employed spe- 
cial secretaries to give particular attention to this work, thus mark- 
ing the beginning of a new epoch. The successful features and 
methods for good work were gradually selected and brought to the 
attention of the associations by means of printed matter, addresses, 
conferences, and correspondents. Similarly, unsuccessful features 
and methods were discouraged, and all that concerned the efficiency 
of association educational work received attention. 
Special effort among boys was begun, and the educational depart- 
ment gradually came to be regarded more as a vital part of the 
association movement. It ceased to be a side issue with the majority 
of leaders. Increasing effort was made to discover definite and par- 
ticular needs of men and boys, and the work was placed on a much 
stronger financial basis by charging a small tuition fee for class work. 
Increasing interest was taken in many forms of applied science 
as related to manufacture, industry, and trade. <A system of inter- 
national examinations was inaugurated in 1896 which materially 
strengthened the quality of work done and increased the respect and 
support of the public. Educational institutions began to encourage 
and commend the association, instead of criticising its educational 
efforts, as they had formerly done. 
In promoting the work during this period the international com- 
mittee made large use of exhibits at State and international conven- 
tions. The first of the educational exhibits recommended by the
-P-A-G-E-631
THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS, 577 
committee was in connection with the State conventions of Connecti- 
cut and New York, in February, 1893. The New York State exhibit 
comprised a few drawings and exercises in arithmetic and book- 
keeping from six or eight associations, and was arranged on settees 
in a small parlor in the basement of the church in Saratoga Springs, 
which entertained the convention. It was such a modest affair that 
it was deemed wise not to call the attention of the delegates pub- 
licly to it. One by one, however, many of the delegates saw it and 
gained interest and information from it. At the international con- 
vention of May, 1893, the first international exhibit was held at 
Indianapolis, and at the close of the convention it was transferred to 
the World’s Fair in Chicago. From that source the associations of 
the country in those days gained much helpful inspiration, for at 
least 300,000 people studied the exhibit. Later exhibits were made at 
the conventions, in 1895 at Springfield, Mass,; in 1897 at Mobile; in 
1899 at Grand Rapids; and the series culminated with the jubilee 
exhibit at Boston in 1901, where 136 different associations partici- 
pated, with 60,000 pieces of exhibit material. Traveling exhibits 
were used with advantage from 1893 to 1897. 
During this period much attention was given to unifying and 
placing the class work upon a more solid and systematic basis. The 
greater need seemed to be in that direction. From desultory and 
disorganized work there has gradually grown a regular system of 
supplementary educational work under association auspices with 
more or less definite courses of study, more and more experienced 
teachers paid for efficient service, and with a quality of work which is 
encouraged and helpfully maintained by the international educa- 
tional examinations. 
(e) 1900 to date, the period of expansion. The present period is 
one of expansion and extension. The general objects, principles, 
methods, and policies are continued with ever better quality, in- 
creased. interest, and larger value. Spring terms are added to the 
winter work, and day service becomes more prominent as an expan- 
sion of the evening work. Summer schools for boys during July and 
August are conducted in increasing numbers. Special schools of 
many kinds have had their birth in the association in the effort to 
meet present day needs of men and boys—as automobile, accounting, 
art and decoration, salesmanship, advertising, insurance, real estate, 
textile designing, plumbing, fruit culture, poultry raising, and many 
others. 
Work outside the building has begun to grow rapidly. Much in- 
terest is taken in new forms of industrial education and vocational 
training; various features pertaining to agriculture, gardening, live 
stock, and scores of the newer vocations claim increasing attention.

Local supervision increases in extent and in the efficiency of service. 
Some State supervision is given with splendid results. Increased 
emphasis is placed on quality of service, rather than quantity; to 
develop intensively rather than extensively; on the higher and more 
efficient training of educational secretaries, and on Christian character 
building among both men and boys. 
II, NEED, PURPOSE, AND NATURE OF ASSOCIATION EDUCATIONAL WORK. 
1. Need.—We believe in the American public-school system with 
its unbroken course from the kindergarten to the university. Only 
when these opportunities are used universally and effectively can 
best dividends be realized. But the majority of men and boys have 
not profited as much as they should by the great wealth of public- 
school facilities. 
When we learn from authorities that two-thirds of the boys have 
left school by the end of the eighth grade; that the average length 
of a boy’s schooling is less than six years; that only 5 per cent of all 
males are fitted by definite educational training for their vocations; 
that illiteracy among voters in the United States is many times more 
prevalent than in England, Scotland, or many other nations; that 
there is much less opportunity here for vocational training than in 
other nations—then we may realize the great need for supplementary 
educational facilities for men and boys in America. j 
2. Purpose.--To meet the demands of our present day complex 
civilization, there is great opportunity for the service of individuals, 
of clubs, of the church, and of the Young Men’s Christian Associa- 
tions. All forms of supplementary agencies for training men and 
boys may well be enlarged to encourage, strengthen, and expand the 
usefulness of the public schools. As the church, through the past 
200 years, has so often wisely led in providing educational training 
through college, technical schools, and other appropriate features, so 
its leaders through the associations are now striving to help meet the 
need of the time. The purpose in so doing is to develop Christian 
manhood; to help men and boys help themselves; to inspire them to 
higher ideals of life and service; to acquaint them with, and help 
them wisely to develop, their own capabilities; to increase habits of 
industry and thrift; and to prepare them to render more easily, 
willingly, and effectively the highest type of industrial, social, and 
Christian service. 
Association educational work thus encourages and strengthens other 
good forms of educational work; improves citizenship and assists 
commerce and trade through appropriate facilities offered at any time 
of the day or night, and it places emphasis upon Christian character 
building as fundamental.

3. Scope and nature of the work.—Many years of experience in 
an ever-enlarging program of practical educational activities, con- 
ducted either in the association building or outside of it, have 
developed the following general classes of privileges. The figures 
presented are for the school year 1912-18: 
(a) Reading rooms. The association provides, cares for, and 
encourages the careful reading of the best periodicals, magazines, 
technical and trade journals. Nearly 1,000,000 persons enjoy this 
privilege daily. 
(6) Books and libraries. The reading of good books is con- 
stantly stimulated. The working library for study and research is 
the means of most efficient and permanent educational service. Pub- 
lic and private libraries are used increasingly; 700,000 good books 
were read. 
(¢) Educational lectures. Formal high-grade lectures for mixed 
audiences, and with paid speakers of national reputation, are pro- 
moted; 3,412 such lectures were given. 
(d) Practical talks. Informal talks or demonstrations are given 
by local talent to small groups at any time or place, day or night; 
7,700 were given, attended by 416,000 employed men and boys. 
(e) Educational tours. Weekly or monthly trips to places of his- 
torical, social, industrial, scientific, or religious interest are enjoyed 
under competent leadership. 
(f) Educational clubs. Many different kinds are promoted for 
research, study, discussion, reading, and service. There are 1,023 
such groups, with 23,821 members. 
(g) Class-lecture series. Professional, semiprofessional, and voca- 
tional subjects for mature men are handled by experienced teachers — 
and leaders. Tuition fees are charged, which usually more than 
cover the expenses. The work requires much reading, discussion, 
conversation, and demonstration. Such courses include law, ac- 
countancy, real estate, advertising, salesmanship, fruit culture, credit 
work, poultry raising, eugenics, and the like. Over 7,300 business 
and college men are students in such courses. 
(A) Educational classes. These include commercial, industrial, 
trade, academic, language, and high-school subjects, taught by expe- 
rienced and successful men teachers. The courses usually run dur- 
ing a term of 25 sessions or during the entire year of 80 or 100 
sessions. Students pay tuition fees of varying amounts, depending 
upon the subject and the expense of its conduct. In elementary 
subjects the fee does not, and should not, cover the expenses. In- 
struction is given in 120 subjects to 72,842 employed men and boys 
by 2,646 teachers. The students pay $714,035 in tuition fees. 
(4) Tutoring. In addition to the work in the classroom, the 
association often arranges with some teacher to meet the individual  
-P-A-G-E-634
  
  580 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
needs of a student seeking personal instruction. Such fees are 50 
cents or more per hour. 
(j) Individual altruistic service. Aside from the above standard. 
activities, many associations, through whole-souled Christian teach- 
ers and leaders, conduct unadvertised altruistic service, in which 
each person gladly invests some of his time and effort with no 
thought of financial return, to help, to teach, and to be a real friend 
of some other person, like the spirit and practice of the big-brother 
movement. The amount of such service now rendered is very large 
and increasing, but there is opportunity for its infinite expansion. 
(%) Extension features. Over 100 associations are helping to 
meet educational needs of men and boys outside the association 
building, using the above features in various kinds of city centers 
as in shops, offices, stores, homes, clubs, rented halls, school buildings, 
and other places. Over 100,000 men and boys were thus aided. 
(2) Coming Americans. Many associations are teaching non- 
English-speaking males in commercial and industrial life to speak, 
read, and write in English. As far as possible, and by wise counsel 
and instruction, they are led into intelligent American citizenship. 
Over 15,000 students were thus aided. 
(m) Day privileges. In addition to the evening facilities a num- 
ber of associations now conduct regularly organized educational 
privileges in the daytime, including various kinds of schools, courses, 
and subjects for males of all ages over 14. About 7,000 are enrolled. 
(n) Among special groups. While the great majority of this sup- 
plementary practical educational work is conducted for city men and 
boys in general, yet there is a growing work with similar privileges 
among each of the following groups of men and boys: Railroad em- 
ployees, the Army and Navy, industrial workers, farmers, negroes, 
Indians, and college students. 
(0) Among boys. <A large and growing movement with over 
16,000 boys already enrolled in definite evening classwork is in oper- 
ation. Employed boys, who have left the public schools and among 
whom there is such need for educational training, form the largest 
single opportunity. Over 11,600 of these are now in association 
classes. About 2,000 boys are studying in association camp schools, 
and over 4,000 in vacation or summer schools in association build- 
ings. 
(p) Vocational training. Such subjects as industrial education, 
continuation schools, apprentice schools, vocational guidance, etc., 
are demanding large and increasing attention. The associations find 
here a favorable field for service, and are already making commend- 
able progress. About 35,000 men and boys are in these various 
courses under association auspices.

THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS. 581 
In 1893, at Springfield, Ohio, W. J. Frazer, the general secretary, 
and D. F. Graham, a skilled mechanic, both with a conviction that 
the association should help men in the industrial vocations, con- 
ducted courses in patternmaking, toolmaking, and cabinetwork, sup- 
plemented with mechanical drawing and shop mathematics. That 
was the beginning of vocational training along industrial lines in 
the association. 
III. SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
With the growth of this educational movement there comes in- 
creasing demand for competent and trained leadership. The annual 
expenses of this educational work in North America for the school 
year 1912-13 were nearly $1,000,000; tuition receipts from students 
were $714,000. The problems of securing the 2,600 paid teachers 
and over 2,000 volunteer leaders, of maturing plans for meeting 
discovered needs, and of successfully cooperating with the all-round 
association work require the highest qualities of local educational 
leadership. 
1. Local supervision—In 1892 Mr. Edwin F. See, the general 
secretary at Brooklyn, N. Y., asked Mr. W. H. Coughlin, who for 
two years had been teaching free-hand drawing in that association, to 
give one-half of his entire time to promoting the educational fea- 
tures of the association. He thus served two years on half time, and 
from 1894 for 12 years gave full time to such work; he was then 
made librarian of the association and educational secretary “ emeri- 
tus.” Thus began the work of the educational secretaryship. 
In 1894 the Hartford, Conn., association employed Mr. N. P. Work, 
at first for part time and then for full time, to promote such work. 
In the same year Mr. W. M. Wood began like service in the Chicago 
association, giving his entire time to it. No person in those years 
did more than he to help associations appreciate the value of supple- 
mentary educational work among men and boys. W. M. Sherman 
in the same year, on part time at first, began promoting such work 
at the Tweny-third Street branch, New York. In 1896 Mr. F. P. 
Speare became educational secretary of Boston, in which capacity he 
still serves, and Mr. W. F. Hirsch began in Buffalo. In 1898 J. F. 
Hill entered similar work at Cambridge, .E. A. Purdy in Minneapolis, 
Abram Ebersole in St. Louis, W. B. Van Akin in Detroit, and A. A. 
Macurda in San Francisco. 
These were the beginnings of local supervision of educational 
work in Young Men’s Christian Associations. Before 1896. there 
were but five educational secretaries. Their salaries ranged from 
$400 to $1,100; they had no stenographic or clerical help, and they 
served from 10 to 14 hours per day, with no “time off.” Now, 
(October, 1913) each of the 80 associations with educational super-
-P-A-G-E-636
582 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
vision has from 1 to 10 men employed for their entire time either 
as secretaries or as heads of departments of instruction or as teachers. 
The salaries for the senior secretaries range from $1,200 to over 
$2,500; they usually have stenographic help; they spend about nine 
hours per day at their work; and they have one day and often two 
or more evenings per week for themselves. 
Of these 80 senior educational secretaries, 16 are between 20 and 
80 years of age, 40 are between 30 and 40, nineteen are between 40 
and 50, and 4 are over 50. As to their period of service, 25 have 
served a minimum of two years previous to 1913, 23 have served 
three years; 18 four years, 16 five years, 12 six years, 11 seven 
years, 8 eight years, 8 nine years, 3 thirteen years, and 2 others for 
sixteen years or more. The average length of service of these men is 
a little over five years. 
Of 47 senior educational secretaries who have served two years or 
more and have then left the position, 25 per cent have entered busi- 
ness, 30 per cent have entered the various professions, and 45 per cent 
have entered other positions in the association, most of them becoming 
general secretaries. Indeed, from the ranks of educational secre- 
taries a larger relative proportion of general secretaries have been 
drawn than from the physical, boys’, and religious work secretaries 
combined. i 
Among the conditions and qualities which have held men in this 
work, often declining offers of larger salaries, are the following: 
(a) Strong Christian character and a deep conviction concerning 
the place of the association in helping boys and men; (6) encour- 
agement and cooperation from the secretary, the board, and other 
officers; (c) qualities of successful teamwork, including helpful 
cooperation with other departments; (d) patience, tact, faithful- 
ness, foresight; (¢) a firm belief in quality of service rather than in 
quantity; (f) a realization of the cumulative value of continuous 
service in educational work—a fact of greater importance than in 
any other department, because of the growing standards in educa- 
tional matters recognized by the public. Naturally these ideal con- 
ditions and qualities are not always found, and some of the educa- 
tional secretaries have discontinued the work because of the lack of 
them. 
2. State supervision.—In 1899 George S. Budd was employed by 
the State committee of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to encourage 
and promote association educational work throughout the associations 
of the two States. He gave his entire time to wise promotive effort. 
This proved to be an excellent step. In 1903, being called to the 
State secretaryship of Ohio, he was succeeded by A. G. Bookwalter, 
who efficiently served in that capacity seven years, when he in turn 
 
-P-A-G-E-637
  THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS. 583 
became State secretary of Ohio. Mr. W. C. Smith succeeded Mr. 
Bookwalter in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in 1910. 
Following the example of Massachusetts, the State committee of 
Ohio in 1901 employed George B. Landis as State educational secre- 
tary. With the exception of the interval 1904-5, Mr. Landis suc- 
cessfully served until 1908. Ohio will soon add another man to the 
State force. In 1912 Pennsylvania secured Mr. Landis as its State 
educational secretary. In 1907 New Jersey State committee similarly 
employed M. A. Leiper. He served one year. In 1910 the New 
York State committee employed E. C. Myers to give half time as 
its State educational secretary; he resigned May 1, 1911. 
Money invested in the right kind of men to promote educational 
work proves to be one of the best investments that can be made by 
any State committee. Such service strengthens the large associations 
and materially aids the smaller ones. 
3. International supervision —tIn 1893 the educational department 
of the international committee began its service with George B. 
Hodge as educational secretary. He still serves the committee in that 
capacity. In 1899 A. G. Bookwalter was added to the force. He 
served two years and was succeeded by George A. Gregg, who served 
until 1906, when he became the educational secretary in Seoul, Korea. 
In 1907 Mr. R. T. Hill began giving part time to educational work 
among boys and he served until December, 1911. In 1907 Mr. W. J. 
Lamkie began with the Army and Navy department of the com- 
mittee’s work and served until May, 1911. In 1907 Mr. R. C. Morse, 
jr., began service as railroad educational secretary on the Gould lines, 
with headquarters in St. Louis. After two years he was succeeded by 
Mr. F. M. M. Richardson, who has recently been transferred to the 
position of railroad educational secretary of the international com- 
mittee, with headquarters in New York. In May, 1911, Mr. R. P. 
Kaighn began promoting appropriate educational features among in- 
dustrial workers under the auspices of the industrial department of 
the international committee. 
To continue and increase this kind of cooperative educational serv- 
ice the international committee greatly needs financial support to 
secure additional men to meet the demands upon it. Two or more 
strong and experienced men are necessary in the general work of the 
educational department to supplement the efforts of Mr. Hodge. One 
more is necessary to give special attention to this work among em- 
ployed boys; another to similarly promote association day schools; 
another to give special attention to similar work in rural districts; 
another for similar service among negroes; and one more for special 
work in the Army and Navy associations. 
4. Educational secretaries’ association—To promote the interests of 
association educational work the educational secretaries’ association 
 
-P-A-G-E-638
  584 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
was organized in 1895 at Springfield, Mass. Sessions have been held 
in connection with the international conventions or with the employed 
officers’ conferences each year to the present time. The membership 
has grown from 5 to 65. The gatherings of this group were in 1902 
at Mountain Lake Park, Md.; in 1903 at Lakewood, N. Y.; 1904 at 
Buffalo; 1905 at Niagara Falls; 1906 at Indianapolis; 1907 at Wash- 
ington; 1908 at Atlantic City; and 1912 at Silver Bay, N. Y. 
5. Necessity for training—Men who succeed in the majority of 
positions to-day are those who have been obliged to give from 5 to 10 
years to a study of the history, principles, and policies governing the 
work of the position held. The day is past when the “ jack-of-all- 
trades” can accomplish much in any vocation, much less in modern 
association service. 
To this end the association training schools at Chicago and at 
Springfield, Mass., are giving more thought each year. The train- 
ing centers in a few local associations afford opportunity for some 
such study of educational work. ‘The book, Association Educational 
Work for Men and Boys, published by the Y. M. C. A. Press, is the 
most complete handbook yet provided for such study by individuals, 
either alone, in training centers, in summer schools, or elsewhere. 
The summer schools for educational secretaries at Silver Bay 
and Lake Geneva afford a rare opportunity for conference, study, 
interviews, and training. About one-half the educational secretaries 
attend these summer schools. The following is a brief outline of 
the topics covered annually in August at Silver Bay, N. Y., in a 
three-year course for educational secretaries. The course is adapted 
to meet the experience and maturity of the men. It includes system- 
atic work five periods per day, one of which is in the Bible study, one 
in association principles and fundamentals, and three in technical 
educational topics. The work is made more and more helpful and 
practical each succeeding year. A similar course, at present cover- 
ing the first two years, is given at Lake Geneva, Wis., annually in 
July. 
SUMMER COURSE FOR EDUCATIONAL SECRETARIES. 
First year.—This course is limited to association officers and others who have 
had but little experience. It involves 1 daily session in Bible study; 1 in asso- 
ciation principles; 8 sessions on fundamental educational principles; 10 on edu- 
cational features; and 15 on methods. It includes such topics as how to study 
the field; how to advertise; how to secure teachers; how to organize and con- 
duct classwork; the educational secretary, his qualifications and duties; 
finances; and many other topics. 
Second year.—This course is limited to those who have completed the first- 
year course or its equivalent in a number of years in successful service. It 
includes 1 session daily in Bible study; 10 sessions on history, principles and 
pedagogy of association educational work; 10 on educational features and their 
extension; and 12 on administration and conduct. It includes such topics as
-P-A-G-E-639
  THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATIONS. 585 
association pedagogy, industrial education, apprentice schools, the budget, text- 
books and courses, daywork, vocational guidance, special schools, and others. 
*° Third year.—The course is limited to those who have completed the work of 
the second year. In addition to Bible study daily, it includes 8 sessions on 
supervision, history, and principles; 10 on features, problems, and administra- 
tion; and 16 on seminar work. Each student must prepare a thesis, which he 
is required to defend before the institute for one or two sessions. The course 
also includes some advanced problems, conferences, and work, with one or 
more outside authorities. Satisfactory, completion of the requirements for the 
three-years’ course entitles one to receive the honors of graduation; 17 men 
have won such honors in the past three years. 
6. International examinations—Written tests are valuable exer- 
cises in association work. They have proven beneficial for the fol- 
lowing reasons: They have served as a helpful stimulus to teachers 
and students; they encourage much more thoroughness and definite- 
ness in the work; they are valuable exercises in written English, 
since they require concise, clear, and accurate statements; they re- 
veal to the students their own weaknesses and defects, as well as their 
abilities and successes; they demand concentration of mind, sus- 
tained mental effort, and a ready use of one’s resources. Unques- 
tionably they are also valuable as educational discipline. 
The international examinations are regularly held the first week 
in April, the first week in June, and the third week in December: 
While these written tests are not obligatory, 136 different associations 
took them last year; 4,000 men and boys participated; and 2,153 
certificates were won, 
Definite regulations concerning dates and the conduct of the tests 
are necessarily clearly stated and carefully followed. Associations 
desiring to take part must send in their order for question papers 
before certain dates; the tests must be given on the exact date speci- 
fied or the results are not accepted; each student must have a copy 
of the questions direct from the international committee; papers 
marked 65 or more by local examiners must reach the international 
committee within 10 days after the test; final papers passing, the 
international examiner at 75 or more are entitled to certificates. A 
fee must be paid by each applicant, amounting to 25 cents per ques- 
tion for elementary tests and 50 cents for each advanced test. 
The standard courses of study given in the 142-page book, Out- 
lines of Courses of Study, published by Association Press, New. York, 
embrace the essential principles of over 100 subjects as applied in 
the best evening schools in America and Europe; and the examina- 
tion covers those fundamental principles. For each of the. courses 
there is an examiner whose final statement is accepted by the inter- 
national committee. 
%. Then and now.—When the international committee began to 
encourage, unify, and promote this work in 1893, it was crude and 
 
-P-A-G-E-640
  586 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
superficial and the interest was indifferent. There were only a few 
courses and these mostly in commercial and language subjects, and 
they were very poorly attended; there were only a handful of poorly” 
paid teachers; little or no public respect was accorded them, and no 
encouragement was received from educators; but few students at- 
tended, and those were nearly all in the elementery subjects; it was 
regarded only as a side issue and not a regular part of the associa- 
tion work; it had no special provisions in buildings or equipment 
and no tuition receipts. 
Now there are over 130 courses, industrial, trade, and vocational, 
as well as commercial and language; the attendance is more regular 
than that of public evening schools; there is increasingly favorable 
public sentiment and more cooperation from educators; nearly six 
times as many regular students attend, including business men and 
college graduates, in addition to those in the three R’s; the work is 
regarded as a vital part of association work, instead of as a side 
issue; many large and specially designed buildings provide accom- 
modations and equipment; and receipts from tuition fees alone pro- 
vide 65 per cent of the expenses of a work that is 15 times as large 
as 19 years ago. 
8. In foreign lands.—The relation of the international committee 
to the various association interests in many foreign nations, as China, 
Japan, India, South America, Africa, Turkey, etc., is such that more 
and more these nations are seeking and using men, methods, and 
policies from the North American associations. While the educa- 
tional work in such foreign associations is now comparatively small, 
with appropriate leadership and support it will become one of the 
strongest elements in the development of efficient Christian manhood 
and boyhood in those nations. There are already more than a thou- 
sand teachers giving instruction to over 15,000 students in associa- 
tions in foreign lands.

MOTION PICTURES AS AN AID TO EDUCATION.

Editor of “ Moving Picture News,’ New York City. 
ConTENTS.—Development of motion pictures—Cinematography in education—Obstacles to the use of 
films in schools—Homemade films are entirely practicable—Some of the advocates of motion 
pictures—Motion picturecs in color—Conclusion.: 
DEVELOPMENT OF MOTION PICTURES. 
The first photograph of the human face in motion was exhibited in 
a photographer’s window in Sloane Street, London, England, in 
1889. This crude attempt was made under great difficulties. 
William Friese Greene, the experimenter, made his own film, emul- 
sionized it, cut it into 20 or 25 foot lengths, and projected it with the 
same mechanism he had used in his camera for making the negatives. 
The experiment was largely commented upon in the papers of the 
time. This was a decided advance upon the zoetrope and Edward 
Muybridge’s experiments with a battery of cameras whose shutters 
were released by snapping a series of threads as trotting horses 
passed and broke them. 
Simultaneously with Greene in England, Thomas A. Edison was 
making his experiments in America with the kinetoscope. The 
American Mutoscope Co. also brought out their machine about the 
same time. In the kinetoscope the pictures were arranged on long 
strips of paper which moved rapidly before the eye of the observer 
who peered through a lens. The mutoscope was also arranged for a 
single observer, but in it photographs on paper were attached to the 
edge of a wheel which in revolving flicked the pictures into view as 
one would flick a pack of cards from the edges. Both these machines 
were extensively used at fairs and “penny arcades.” 
It was only when George Eastman perfected the film so well known 
at the present day, that cinematography made any material advance, 
for the long film made it possible for the first time to get satisfactory 
results. Then the Messrs. Lumiere, in Lyon, France, made their 
machine for projection on the screen. The Messrs. Gaumont followed. 
Simultaneously Marey and Demeney, of Paris, began their experi- 
587 
 
-P-A-G-E-642
D882 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
ments, making great improvement in the mechanism of both the 
camera and the projecting machines. During the next five years 
makers of cameras and of projectors sprang up everywhere, each 
vying with the other to do something better than his fellow. From 
25-foot lengths the film was extended to 50. Then a mcthod of 
joining was discovered, which made it possible gradually to increase 
the length of the negative film to 200, 300, or 400 feet, and the 
positive to the present-day reel of 1,000 feet. 
The popularity of cinematography (the name was coined by the 
French manufacturers) grew so rapidly that the manufacturers could 
not supply the demand and the showmen became manufacturers. At 
the present day, pictures and machines are made in every quarter of 
the two hemispheres. 
At first the pictures were mediocre in quality and ridiculous in 
treatment. _They were almost exclusively devoted to comedy of the 
“slap-stick” type. The novelty of movement in pictures was so 
great that the quality of the subjects was overlooked. The public 
soon tired of such pictures however, and in response to the evident 
demand, manufacturers in England began to photograph scenery, 
pleasure resorts, seaside views, fire-brigade drills, and the like. The 
example was followed in other countries, and a high degree of 
excellence was attained, especially in France. 
The Boer War gave the first real impetus to the industry. Mr. 
Charles Urban, of London, dispatched to South Africa a staff of 
photographers, who sent their negatives to England for development; 
and all over the world scenes of the war were flashed on thousands of 
screens. Thus originated the “moving-picture bulletin,” or ani- 
mated newspaper. Since then, practically every important event in 
the world’s history has been written on cinematograph film, instruct- 
ing thousands in a language that can be understood by people of every 
nationality. 
During the period of progress, it was often difficult to find suitable 
subjects, and anything the manufacturers chose to foist upon the 
public was exhibited by the showmen. Many of the subjects were 
French, and they may or may not have satisfied French audiences; 
but when they were imported to America and England some of them 
proved to be entirely too broad for the more particular tastes of those 
countries. 
Gradually the practice arose of forming stock companies to act 
complete plays under the direction of full-fledged stage managers. 
A new profession grew out of this change, that of scenario writing. 
At first, the manufacturers exercised little care in the selection of 
“plays,” and apparently took anything that was submitted to them, 
paying from $5 to $15 for a “script.” These were frequently based 
upon train robberies, hold-ups, burglaries, shootings, murders, elope-
-P-A-G-E-643
    MOTION PICTURES AS AN AID TO EDUCATION. 589 
ments, and domestic infelicities more or less questionable in tone. 
These films were made by the thousands, until an outraged public 
raised a protest, and the authorities of various cities began to censor 
some of the most flagrant violations of decency. Then pictures of 
cowboys, ‘Wild West” stories, made-up Indians, and similar sub- 
jects were made to head the list. These are now rapidly dying out, 
and elaborate and carefully staged pictures, such as_ biblical, 
mythological, historical, and classicai plays are now given 
prominence. — 
During the process of evolution has come the demand of intelligent 
audiences for a larger number of high-class films. Charles Urban, of 
London, has been notably successful in meeting this demand. He 
saw the need and has tried faithfully to supply it. Pathé Freres, 
Gaumont, and Eclair, of Paris and America, are ably supporting him, 
and to-day a great number of excellent scientific, artistic, historical, 
religious, and other films are available for educational purposes. 
CINEMATOGRAPHY IN EDUCATION. 
A canvass was made a short while ago by a New York daily news- 
paper of thousands of schools, colleges, and other institutions of 
learning throughout the United States. It was found that the insti- . 
tutions were nearly unanimous in favor of teaching by cinematog- 
raphy; and the prediction was made by most of them that the day 
was close at hand when they would all consider the cinematograph 
projector and film as an indispensable part of their equipment. 
It is contended that the eye grasps facts more quickly and retains 
them for a longer time than the ear. A class instructed by demon- 
stration and illustration is far better equipped than the class depend- 
ing upon the spoken word alone. It is possible to illustrate with the 
moving picture almost every subject, from the kindergarten to the 
university, inclusive, and pictures could easily be made to follow the 
textbooks. 
In preparing scientific films for general use the greatest difficulty 
is to make them in such a way that they can be easily understood. 
In the films of history and classical literature there is another and 
graver danger—that of misrepresenting facts. There have been many 
such films made which are useless for educational purposes for that 
reason alone. Many a director has sacrificed truth because he thought 
the story could be more dramatic or because in some way it suited 
his purpose better if changed. Imagine the doubt in the minds of 
school children. In more than one actual instance in the New York 
schools the question has been asked by pupils whether the moving 
picture or the textbook was correct. The exhibition of such films 
should not be allowed. So important is the matter that the board 
of education in every city or town should have the power to prohibit
-P-A-G-E-644
  590 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the exhibition of them. Whether of art, science, history, or litera- 
ture, the pictures must be correct in every detail. 
Films available for educational purposes are manufactured by sey- 
eral foreign firms, who ship them to this country, and through various 
agencies endeavor to create a demand for their wares. But the 
business of distribution is practically in the hands of a few men, who 
are making greater profit from the amusement side, and little advance 
has been made in introducing strictly educational films. No manu- 
facturer in this country is enterprising enough to make any quantity 
of such films. Nevertheless, the films already available cover a large 
field and are easily procurable from England, France, Germany, and 
Italy. Those made in America are confined almost entirely to experi- 
ments with chemicals and liquid air and a small number on subjects 
in hygiene. A few made under the supervision of scientists are not 
available for general use. 
The following is a partial list of subjects upon which excellent 
films may be obtained: 
Aeronautics Fisheries Natural sciences 
Agriculture Forestry Optics 
Applied sciences Geography Physics 
Apiculture Geology Pisciculture 
Archeology History Physical culture 
Architecture Hydraulics Railways 
Army and Navy Hydrography Scenic views 
Athletics Industries Seismology 
Ballooning Literature Sports of various countries 
Chemistry Mechanics Surgery 
Classics Microscopic Travels 
Dances (both civilized and Mining Volcanoes 
barbaric) Music 
Fine arts Mythology 
Each of these headings may be more fully amplified. Agriculture 
includes such subjects as irrigation, works on new farms, clearing the 
land by donkey engines, blasting tree stumps and rocks with dyna- 
mite, sowing wheat, reaping, thrashing, etc., potato culture, cattle 
ranching, rice culture, growing stalks, transplanting, irrigating, 
milling; modern methods of mowing and haying; corn and wheat 
harvesting; sheep ranching, shearing and gathering wool; cider 
making; culture of tobacco; cotton cultivation; the maple-sugar 
industry; pine-apple industry; mushroom culture; tea planting, and 
numerous others. 
Aviation and aeronautics show balloon ascensions and panoramic 
views taken from them of the country beneath. Spencer, Santos 
Dumont, Phillips, Forman, Wilbur Wright, and practically the whole 
army of aviators and their flying machines contribute to these sub- 
jects. Count Zeppelin’s various models of dirigible balloons are also
-P-A-G-E-645
  MOTION PICTURES AS AN AID TO EDUCATION. 591 
represented. Then there are the war balloons and dirigibles of 
several countries, and the events of aero clubs. 
The industries pictured cover a wide range. The titles of some of 
the subjects are: Wood carving, chain making, clog making, con- 
structing locomotives, glue making, ice harvesting, working of steam 
laundry, making pottery, manufacturing barrels, manufacturing steel 
rails, charcoal making, and marble quarrying. Manufacturers adding 
to this list from to-day are covering every conceivable field lending 
itself to reproduction by the camera. 
Under ‘“‘Ancient and modern architecture” are found, in many 
pictures, ruins all over the world. Ancient Rome, the Forum, the 
Coliseum, Athens and the Acropolis, ancient Sicily, Pompeii, ancient 
castles, fountains of Rome, the Alhambra, abbeys and cathedrals 
from the earliest years of the Christian era to the present day. 
Army pictures illustrate all branches of the service in practically 
every country. Naval films cover the various navies, their battle- 
ships and maneuvers, the launching of war vessels, the life and drills 
of the sailors, and the life and drills of cadets at the naval academies: 
“Natural science’’ covers an immense field: The life history of the 
moth, showing the laying and the hatching of the eggs, the feeding 
and development of the caterpillar, the weaving of the cocoon, and 
the final emerging of the moth; the gradual development from the 
early stages of the embryo of the chick, shown by the X ray, to the 
hatching; various wild birds in their natural surroundings, their 
nests, young, etc.; the growth and blossoming of flowers. Innumer- 
able pictures of all sorts of animals, both wild and tame, belong in 
this list, besides the many of inanimate nature. 
Pisciculture and fisheries are represented by pictures taken in 
many parts of the world. Some of the subjects are: The Scotch 
herring fishery; Rogie Falls and salmon fishing; fish traps, Columbia 
River; hauling in a big catch; hauling in seines and pulling seines 
into the boat; unloading fish at cannery; catching trout for spawning; 
spawning trout; hauling in nets at Vancouver; trapping salmon on 
the Fraser River, B. C.; tunny; quail fishing; angling in Norway. 
Among the most interesting and the most wonderful are the 
microscopical pictures taken with cameras fitted with microscopical 
attachments. A few of the subjects are: The amoeba; circulation 
of protoplasm; circulation of blood in a frog’s leg; circulation of 
blood in the tail of a gold fish; ciliary movement in the gills of a 
mussel; typhoid bacteria; cheese mites; head of a house fly; para- 
mecium; young oysters; living bacteria. 
Railroad films are gathered from many sources. They comprise 
those taken of the various workshops, where all parts of the cars and 
locomotives are made; the preparing of roadbeds; the laying of
-P-A-G-E-646
592 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
rails; and innumerable scenes taken along many of the railroad 
systems of all countries. 
A few films listed under ‘‘Sports and athletics” are: Cross-country 
running on snow shoes; exciting steeple chase; hockey match on the 
ice, Montreal; hunting big game in Africa; in the jungle, and native 
sports; Indians at work and play, Carlisle; long distance horse race, 
Stockholm, Sweden; pole jumping by the Borneo natives; ski jump- 
ing, Norway; surf-board riders, Waikiki, Hawaii; Swedish army 
gymnastics; tobogganing, Montreal, Canada; water sports, Lakat 
Datie, Borneo. 
“Surgery”? comprises operations of various kinds. Dr. Doyen, of 
Paris, heads the list with operations on tumors, diseases of the 
nervous system, and general surgery. Several attempts have been 
made by surgeons in New York along similar lines, but no concerted 
action has been taken to give to the profession the results obtained. 
The catalogues and lists published by Charles Urban, London; 
Gaumont Co., Paris and New York; and the Eclair Co., Paris and 
New York, contain many films suitable for medical schools. 
The following is a sample program given in New York City and 
repeated to capacity houses on several occasions. 
No. 1. Geography: The banks of the Ganges for many miles, showing the massive 
stone buildings and temples, the burning Ghats, and the cremation of the dead; show- 
ing the peasant life in Russia; a band of Cossacks on the march. 
No. 2. Agriculture: A model farm in Argentina; the methods of farming; judging 
prize horses, cattle, etc. 
No. 3. Ornithology: Eider ducks; royal swans; sea gulls; pelicans, snipe, and 
avocets; methods of feeding; their nests and young birds. 
No. 4. Natural history: Feeding caterpillars; weaving cocoons; the moth emerg- 
ing; development of its wings until ready for flight; an otter diving under the water, 
seizing a fish, and devouring it. 
No. 5. Pisciculture: Method of procuring eggs from fish; placing them in the hatch- 
ing troughs; hatching the eggs; the young fish; method of shipping eggs and fish. 
No. 6. Literature: Part of the story of Hiawatha, carefully and correctly arranged 
and acted at and near the Falls of Minnehaha, 
No. 7. Chemistry: The action of acids upon aluminum, magnesium, and oe 
minerals. 3 
No. 8. Botany: The gradual growth of a snowdrop from the time it first peeps from 
the ground until the buds open. 
No. 9. Embryology: The first sign of life in the egg; the gradual development of 
the embryo until the chick breaks through the shell and finds himself in a new world. 
No. 10.. Physical culture: Drilling of the boys at Reedham Orphan Asylum, London, 
England. 
This program would prove interesting to audiences everywhere. 
The exhibition lasts about two hours.

OBSTACLES TO THE USE OF FILMS IN SCHOOLS. 
After enumerating such a list of subjects available for use in teach- 
ing circles, the question may very naturally arise in the mind of the 
reader: If there are good educational films on the market, and so 
many teachers, educators, lecturers, etc., who need them in their 
everyday work, why do they not use them? 
In enumerating the difficulties it may be said that some of these 
films were made for commercial purposes, pure and simple. All 
through the films the makers’ names appear, and in many films love 
stories are interjected to meet the tastes of the audiences of the 
small theaters. These films go the rounds of the shows and are then 
withdrawn and placed on the shelves of the manufacturers. Many 
of them could be used in the classroom, provided the names of the 
manufacturers and similar advertising matter interlarded throughout 
the films were eliminated. 
Another drawback is the siow financial return to be made by the 
handling of educational films, in consequence of which the business is 
neglected. The number in this country is not sufficient, and when 
these are asked for at the exchanges or centers of distribution the 
films needed are almost invariably somewhere else, and the teacher 
who wishes to illustrate some special theme on a certain day learns 
that he must wait a week, two weeks, or even a month. Becoming 
disheartened, he abandons his project. If the teacher wishes to pur- 
chase the special film or films, he is told he must wait until they are 
obtained from England or France, and again the delays of the boats 
and the customs make it almost impossible to secure the subjects for 
at least a month. This makes it very difficult for him to arrange his 
class curriculum. . 
Again, it may be that, having secured a few films and used them to 
advantage, he needs to exemplify more fully the special study. 
Going to the usual trade channels, he is confronted with the fact that 
there are no such other films. To make the subjects he needs may 
cost the manufacturer from $500 up. Who is to pay for this, the 
teacher or the manufacturer? The teacher can not afford it; the 
manufacturer will not. What is the teacher to do? He must make 
these films himself or go without them. 
Another obstacle to the use of films in schools is in the city ordi- 
nances and State laws, which restrict the operation of projecting 
machines. In New York City an operator must obtain a license 
from. the board of water supply, gas, and electricity, and similar 
licenses are required in many other States. There is often difficulty, 
too, in providing the machine house, or booth, required by the board 
of fire underwriters. If a school wishes to give an entertainment, a 
17726°—xp 1918—vort 1——38
-P-A-G-E-648
  594 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
license has to be obtained; an inspector from the license bureau must 
examine the electrical fittings, a booth must be erected, either of 
asbestos, brick, concrete, or iron, fireproof and nearly air proof—a 
death trap for the man who operates the machine. Then the fire 
insurance people increase the insurance rate by 50, 100, 150 per cent, 
because, they claim, that there is great danger from fire. But the 
danger is so infinitesimal that it seems absurd to saddle the industry 
with such restrictions. In the 1912 report of the fire marshal for the 
State of New York 8,165 fires were reported, of which only 9 were 
said to have been caused by moving-picture machines. Every repu- 
table machine to-day is made fireproof. Either the Power Camera- 
graph, the Edison Kinetoscope, the Motiograph, or the Simplex could 
be used in the midst of the audience with perfect safety. 
These are a few of the obstacles, none of them insurmountable, 
and concerted action would probably eliminate them. 
HOMEMADE FILMS ARE ENTIRELY PRACTICABLE, 
The time is rapidly approaching when every university will be 
fully equipped with cameras, perforators, printers, and all the appli- 
ances necessary to make their own negative and positive films. 
Several kinds of small cameras suitable for this work are already 
procurable, and if it is desired to go into more elaborate work, many 
good makes of professional cameras are at the disposal of the experi- 
menter. Many institutions of learning have photographers and 
slide makers who could easily learn to operate a motion-picture 
camera. 
These negatives should be available for purchase by some firm 
making a specialty of educational films, or they should be loaned, on 
an interchangeable system, from university to university. To illus- 
trate: Suppose Prof. A, of Illinois University, has a series of nega- 
tives on physics, while Prof. B, of New York University, has a series 
of negatives on microscopic subjects, bacteria, etc. Illinois wants 
microscopic negatives, and New York wants physics negatives. An 
interchange may be easily made. 
In practically every university and college there is an electrical 
department, and laboratory assistants and students can easily qualify 
to operate a machine. In high and grammar schools the engineer 
or his assistant would be the one to do this work. 
SOME OF THE ADVOCATES OF MOTION PICTURES. 
At the present time a combination of earnest men is in course of 
formation to bring together the various films already made and to 
add to them, from time to time, such subjects as may be required. 
In foreign countries the films are used in the Universities of Berlin 
and Heidelberg, and in the medical and surgical schools of Vienna. In
-P-A-G-E-649
MOTION PICTURES AS AN AID TO EDUCATION. 595 
France, Paris and Lyon are the centers; in England: Kings College, 
London, Cambridge, Oxford, Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester; 
in Scotland: Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen. In Sweden, Stock- 
holm seems to be the only city in which educational films are exten- 
sively used. 
Great credit must be given to Dean Reber, of Wisconsin University, 
for organizing an educational film service in that State. Wisconsin, 
so far as can be learned, is the first State to attempt a systematic use 
of these educational films for instruction in the schools. Dr. Reber 
has organized districts, mapped out the curricula, and is, this season 
of 1913-14, sending to each district, town, or city a series of films in 
circulating-library fashion. This experiment will be watched with 
great interest, and if the supply of films can be made to meet the 
demand, it is probable that other States will follow the lead of 
Wisconsin. 
The State of Minnesota has also found help in the use of Cinematog- 
raphy. The College of Agriculture has made films, not only for its 
own use, but has supplied the trade and other colleges with films on 
this subject. A course of lectures is given in the schools of town 
and country for the benefit of farmers. 
Another active movement of education is that of The American 
Safety League, having main offices at Los Angeles, Cal., and Newark, 
N. J., and branch leagues in Portland, Me., Seattle, Spokane, San 
Francisco, and San Diego. Lecturers visit the schools and instruct 
children how to avoid accidents from automobiles, railway and street 
cars, using lantern slides and motion pictures for illustration. 
Special films have been prepared for the use of social service work- 
ers, the societies for the prevention of tuberculosis, hygienic and 
fresh-air workers, and the temperance movement. One use of the 
pictures is thus explained in a paper augmented with moving pictures, 
by Dr. Walter W. Roach, of Philadelphia, supervisor of medical 
inspectors for the department of health and the board of public 
education: 
The effect of fresh air is to create a desire for exercise—a natural physiological 
demand for increased circulation. To meet this need we provide a series of short 
physical exercises at frequent intervals between lesson periods, designed to promote 
normal chest expansion and deep breathing; never prolonged, however, to produce 
fatigue, nor violent enough at any one time to excite perspiration. 
For the purpose of illustrating a paper read by the writer at the Fourth International 
Congress of School Hygiene, at Buffalo, in August, 1918, permission was secured from 
the parents, and through the courtesy of the school authorities we took a motion picture 
of the Bache School children at class. This moving picture shows actual schoolroom 
conditions and the exercises. Such can be copied and taught by any teacher, once 
they are fixed inthe mind. It isan educational film, produced for the good it may do, 
and is at the disposal of any committee seriously engaged in an effort to secure an open- 
air class for children who need such schooling.
-P-A-G-E-650
  596 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Almost any manager of a motion picture house will accommodate such a committee 
by running the reel in pzivate to explain the idca to schocl board members or parents. 
This requires only about 10 minutes. as the exercises are abbreviated to show the prin- 
ciples involved fox 1 definite end. The other requirements are transportation charges, 
prompt and afe return of the film, with a proportionate cost of the wear and tear to 
replace it, tor it ic calculated that the celluloid film has a limited life based upon the 
- number of times it is used tcr exhibition purposes. 
MOTION PICTURES IN COLOR. 
All the foregoing remarks refer only to black-and-white photog- 
raphy. This paper would not be complete without special mention 
of cinematography in colors. Many attempts have been made to 
take photographs in the colors of nature. Dr. Joly, of Dublin, 
Frederick E. Ives, of New York, Messrs. Lumiere, of Paris, Sanger- 
Shepard, of London, and others, have made successful pictures of 
still lite and have tried to solve the motion picture in colors. It was 
left to Messrs. Charles Urban and G. Albert Smith, of London, to 
bring this problem to a fairly satisfactory solution. 
“Kinemacolor,” as the process is called, requires specially sensi- 
tized film, and the pictures can be made only where there is strong 
sunlight. Therefore, it is available only during certain months of 
the year, except where there is brilliant sunshine ali the year around, 
as in the Southwest. 
Kinemacolor is particularly useful for showing chemical experi- 
ments, inasmuch as the various changes are reproduced in color. 
There are few branches of the curricula of the schools in which this 
process can not be used to advantage. If the history courses are 
illustrated by pictures staged carefully, with due regard to costumes 
and manners of the period, the lessons taught will be of great benefit. 
Geography of any particular country can be readily shown, bringing 
the natural colors before the eyes of the pupils in a manner not possible 
with the black-and-white pictures. In all departments of natural 
science the value of this process is apparent. 
Many notable scenes and ceremonies of great historical value have 
been recorded by kinemacolor. Among them are the coronation 
ceremonies and procession in England, the investure of the Prince 
of Wales, the Durbar, the Panama Canal, and the inauguration of 
President Wilson. 
till another process of cinematography in colors is that of the 
Gaumont Co., of Paris. Their process differs from that of the kine- 
macolor in that it uses the three primary colors, while kinemacolor 
uses only two, one primary and one secondary (red and green). 
Some very beautiful experiments show flowers, fruit, and scenes in 
rural life. 
Both these processes require stronger projecting machines, more 
powerful arcs, and motors to drive the machine. Kinemacolor
-P-A-G-E-651
MOTION PICTURES AS AN AID TO EDUCATION. 597 
doubles the rapidity of projection of black-and-white subjects, while 
the Gaumont process requires two and one-half times the speed. 
Ordinary projection requires approximately 15 to 25 amperes of 
electric current to illuminate the film, which moves at the rate of 
16 pictures per second. Kinemacolor requires 50 to 60 amperes for 
illumination, and the film moves at the rate of 32 pictures per second, 
while the Gaumont process needs from 60 to 80 amperes to illuminate, 
and should have a rapidity of 40 pictures per second. 
Comparing the two processes, black and white with the color, the 
question may arise: If these color pictures are so much superior, why 
use the plain film at all? The reason is obvious. Ordinary films 
range in length, according to scene and subject, from 50 to 1,000 feet. 
To photograph the same subjects kinemacolor requires from 100 
to 2,000 feet and Gaumont 125 to 2,500 feet. From the force of 
hecessity the cost of material doubles and trebles. Cameras and 
projecting apparatus cost more, and much more expert operators 
are required, both. to take and to project the pictures. 
CONCLUSION, 
The foregoing article is sufficient to show at once the wide field 
and the deep significance of educational cinematography. In almost 
every subject in the curricula of schools, colleges, and universities, 
the cinematograph has already lent valuable aid. Within the next 
decade the moving pictures will be the indispensable adjunct of every 
teacher and educational lecturer. On the public platform the cinema- 
tograph will inevitably have its recognized place, and it may even 
invade the pulpit. As the attention and interest of educators are 
more and more drawn to its merits, the future usefulness of the 
educational cinematograph bids fair to surpass the predictions of its 
most sanguine advocates.

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OF THE AMERICAN ARMY. 
By Doveras MacArtuur, Captain, General Staff. 
Approved by order of the Secretary of War, by Leonard Wood, Major General, Chief of Staff. 
  
NECESSITY FOR THOROUGH PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. 
No country in the world has as complete a system of professional 
scholastic training for its officers as the United States. This is due to 
the inherent difference between the military establishments of foreign 
nations and that of our own. Their armies are at all times kept upon 
a war footing, as a result of which they have ample opportunity for — 
the perfect training of the personnel in the practical duties of the 
military profession—a result easily obtained where service is always 
with large bodies of troops. In such an army, the main object is to 
train every man for the efficient performance of his duties in the grade 
which he holds when war comes. A lieutenant does not dream of 
becoming a captain merely as the result of war except as a vacancy 
is made for him in the casualties of battle. Only in the same way 
does a captain expect to become a colonel; nor would the idea be 
tolerated that great numbers of trained line officers are to be sud- 
denly transferred to various staff positions. Their organizations are 
founded upon the theory that there is nothing recondite in the art of 
war; that technical and scientific training is needed by only a small 
portion of military officers; that certain things which a Napoleon must 
know, every officer must know, and can as readily acquire as he; 
while those things which differentiate a Napoleon from other generals 
can not be acquired in any school, not even in that of war. 
Such a system assumes that if the military machine is perfect, and 
every man is fitted for his place and when war comes is in that place, 
a lesser genius than Napoleon can accomplish sufficient things at its 
599
-P-A-G-E-654
  600 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
head; that such an army by its very perfection as a machine will 
supply the advantage of genius to mediocrity. Such a conception is 
sound when it thoroughly fits the local theory of military organization. 
It would be thoroughly unsound if transplanted to the American 
Army, the organization of which is quite different from continental 
armies. In fact, the most striking feature in our service is the 
absence of what constitutes the very essence of the foreign estab- 
lishments; that is, a great standing army serving in corps, divisions, 
and brigades, in which the average officer of any grade learns the 
details of his profession by practical work and with the minimum of 
theory. 
Wars, however, must be fought with large armies; so that our small 
reguiar establishment must be merely the leaven for the large improy- 
ised armies suddenly called into being. Our system of military edu- 
cation must therefore differ from that of the other great nations of 
the world in that we can not be content merely with training a lieu- 
tenant to be a good lieutenant or a captain to be a good captain, or in 
training staff officers to the efficient performance of duties in peace 
which they will continue to perform in the same grade in time of war. 
But the system must be such as to educate our officers so that they 
will be able at a moment’s notice, when the war expansion comes, to 
perform the duties of far-advanced grades and to render service in 
branches of the Army, both line and staff, in which they are not 
commissioned in time of peace. For this reason we have established 
a progressive system of schools designed to teach officers and men, 
limited only by their individual capacities for its assimilation, the 
duty of the man-in-arms in all grades from lowest to highest. 
ee military educational system of the United States comprises: 
. The Military Academy at West Point for the education of cadets. 
. Post schools for the instruction of enlisted men. 
3. Garrison schools for the instruction of officers in subj ects 
pertaining to the performance of their ordinary duties.

THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY. 
The United States Military Academy is a school for the practical 
and theoretical training of cadets for the military service. Upon 
completing its course satisfactorily, cadets are eligible for promo- 
tion and commission as second lieutenants in any arm or corps 
‘of the Army, the duties of which they have been judged competent 
to perform. The supervision and charge of the academy are in the 
War Department under the Chief of Staff. 
The earliest proposal for a military school for the United States 
was that of Brig. Gen. Henry Knox, Chief of Artillery, in May, 1776. 
His plans were seconded by Col. Alexander Hamilton, approved by 
Gen. Washington, and consummated by an act of Congress under 
date of March 16, 1802, authorizing the President to organize and 
establish a Corps of Engineers to consist of five officers and ten 
cadets, constituting a Military Academy, to be stationed at West 
Point. The academy was formally opened July 4. In 1812 a more 
adequate corps of professors was authorized, a maximum of 250 
cadets fixed, and age and mental requisites for admission prescribed. 
The provisions of this reorganization have furnished the general 
principles upon which the Military Academy has since been conducted 
and controlled. 
The corps of cadets as now constituted consists of 1 from each 
congressional district, 1 from each Territory, 2 from the District 
of Columbia, 1 from Porto Rico, 2 from each State at large, and 40 
from the United States at large. Appointment from a congressional 
district is made upon the recommendation of the Representative 
 
-P-A-G-E-656
  602 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
in Congress from that district; from a State at large upon the recom- 
mendations of the Senators of the State, and from the United States 
at large by the President. Those cadets appointed from States or 
Territories must be actual residents of the congressional or terri- 
torial districts, or of the District of Columbia, or of the States, respec- 
tively, from which they are appointed. The maximum number of 
cadets is 580. The total number of graduates from 1802 to 1913, 
inclusive, is 5,205. 
Candidates for admission are required to pass a physical and 
mental examination. They may be excused from the latter if the 
candidate is accredited to or a properly enrolled student in good 
standing of a university, college, or technological school, of the same 
general rating as regards curriculum as Harvard, Yale, Cornell, etc., 
provided he has established proficiency in mathematics A, (algebra 
to quadratics), A, (algebra, quadratics, and beyond), and C (plane 
geometry), and English A (reading and practice) and B (study and 
practice), as outlined by the College Entrance Examination Board; 
or if the candidate presents a properly attested certificate from the 
College Entrance Examination Board that he has passed 14 units 
of its examinations, including mathematics A,, A,, and C, English 
A and B, and history A (ancient history), and D (American history 
and civil government). 
The general physical requirements are as follows: 
No candidate shall be admitted who is under 17 or over 22 years 
of age, or less than 5 feet 4 inches in height at the age of 17, or 5 feet 
5 inches in height at the age of 18 and upward, or who is deformed 
or afflicted with any disease or infirmity which would render him 
unfit for the military service, or who has, at the time of presenting 
himself, any disorder of an infectious or immoral character. Candi- 
dates must be unmarried. 
The mental examination is in the following subjects: Algebra, 
plane geometry, English grammar, English composition, English 
literature, geography, United States history, general history. 
The course of instruction covers four years, the scope and details 
of the work of each department being as follows: 
DEPARTMENT OF TACTICS. 
All classes. 
New cadets upon reporting for duty are given infantry recruit instruction, with 
gymnastic and calisthenic exercises, until they join the battalion. 
Practical instruction is given during the summer encampment, and from September 
1 to November 1 and from March 15 to June 1 in cavalry, artillery, and infantry drill 
regulations, in target practice with the rifle, revolver, mountain gun and field gun, 
and in military engineering. During the summer encampment, cadets of the third and 
fourth classes are also taught swimming and dancing, and those of the first class the 
service of seacoast artillery and submarine defense at Fort Wright, N. Y.; all classes
-P-A-G-E-657
  
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OF THE AMERICAN ARMY. 603 
participate in exercises in minor tactics, practice marches, problems, and practical 
fieldwork, in which the employment of all arms is exemplified. 
Practical instruction in fencing and gymnastic exercises and in boxing and wrestling 
is given to the fourth class from October 1 to June 1 and to the other classes from 
November 1 to March 15. 5 
Instruction in riding is given to the first class during the encampment and from Sep- 
tember 1 to June 1, excepting the month of February; to the second class, from 
November 1 to March 31; and to the third class from November 1 to March 15 and 
during the summer encampment. Instruction with English pad saddles is given to 
the first class and in polo to the first and second classes. 
During the winter months map problems for the purpose of instruction in writing 
orders, selecting positions from the map, both offensive and defensive, making disposi- 
tions of small forces, selecting best route for advance and retreat, and for practice of 
map reading in general; also lectures upon the methods pursued in company, post, and 
staff administration, upon uniforms and equipments, and upon etiquette and customs 
of the service are given cadets of the first class. 
DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND MILITARY ENGINEERING. 
First class. 
The course in civil and military engineering and the art of war is confined to the first- 
class year. 
The course in civil engineering begins September 1 and is completed during the 
first term, which closes with the Christmas holidays. It comprises brief treatises on 
the mechanics of civil engineering, framed and masonry structures, the materials of 
engineering, water supply, and sewerage. 
The course in military engineering and the art of war begins on January 2 and closes 
on the 3d of June. Military engineering embraces the study of field and permanent 
fortifications and siege works. ‘The art of war embraces the study of the organization 
of armies, employment of the different arms in combination, logistics, and strategy. 
To familiarize the students with its principles, lectures are delivered on military 
subjects, and the principal operations of about 20 selected campaigns are studied. 
During this course the students are taken to the battlefield of Gettysburg to familiarize 
them with the effects of topography on the employment of troops in the field. 
DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY. 
Second class. 
The course in natural and experimental philosophy begins with and continues through- 
out the third academic year. Mechanics is studied during the first term. The course 
aims to be as complete as possible, with the limitation that it can be properly covered 
in a term of about 90 to 100 days by students having a proficient knowledge of the cal- 
culus; the treatment is sufficiently mathematical to furnish a confident basis for 
advanced work in the technical staff after graduation. The second term is devoted to 
the subjects of sound and light, and astronomy. 
DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS. 
Third and fourth classes. 
The course in mathematics begins with the fourth-class year and continues through 
the third-class year. In the fourth-class year algebra is completed in alternation; 
first with geometry, then with trigonometry. Plane analytical geometry is begun. 
In the third-class year plane and solid analytical geometry and descriptive geometry 
are completed in alternation. The calculus and least squares finish the course.
-P-A-G-E-658
  604 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The course in algebra covers the entire subject as generally taught in colleges, but 
the student is expected to have already mastered elementary algebra to include the 
progressions and the solution of the quadratic equation. The course in elementary 
geometry includes the books that relate to the plane and those that relate to space, but 
the student is expected to have mastered the former. Plane and spherical trigonom- 
etry includes the complete solution of the plane and spherical triangles. The course 
in analytical geometry includes the discussion of the general equation of the second 
degree in the plane and the particular forms of the equation of the second degree in 
space. Descriptive geometry includes, in orthographic projections, the right line, 
the plane, ruled surfaces and surfaces of revolution, tangent planes, and intersections 
of surfaces. It also covers shades and shadows, perspective, isometric projections, 
and spherical projections. The course in differential and integral calculus covers the 
ground of the usual college textbook, including briefly the subject of ordinary differ- 
ential equations. 
DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, AND GEOLOGY. 
Third and second classes. 
This department embraces two branches of physics not included in its title, namely, 
heat and electricity. 
The course begins March 1 of the second academic year and extends to March 1 of 
the third academic year; exercises, recitations, laboratory work, or lectures take place 
on all week days. : 
Commencing March 1 general chemistry, supplemented by a few lessons in heat, 
occupy the time until the close of the term in June. 
Beginning September 1 the daily exercises alternate between heat and mineralogy 
until these subjects are completed, then the daily exercises alternate between geology 
and eleciricity, the geology being completed by the close of the term, December 23. 
Beginning January 1 the remainder of the course in electricity is completed by the 
end of February. 
DEPARTMENT OF DRAWING. 
Third and second classes. 
The course in drawing extends through the third and second class years, attendance 
on alternate afternoons for a period of two hours during the full academic year. The 
order of instruction is as follows: 
Third class year: 
(1) Elementary freehand perspective drawing from blocks and objects. 
(2) Use of drawing instruments. 
(3) Problems in plane geometry. 
(4) Problems in descriptive geometry. 
(5) Lettering. Exercises in this subject continue throughout the course. 
(6) Elementary problems in third angle projection. 
(7) Building construction drawing. 
Second class year: 
(i) Freehand mechanical, perspective, and memory drawing. 
(2) Isometric projection of framed structure. 
(3) Machine drawing, third angle projection. 
(4) Assembly and working drawings from models. 
(5) Topographical sketching and drawing. 
Instruction is mainly through a loose-leaf system of printed instruction sheets cover- 
ing the various drawings and phases of the work. These are supplemented by short 
section-room lectures and blackboard illustrations when necessary. :

  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OF THE AMERICAN ARMY, 605 
DEPARTMENT OF MODERN LANGUAGES. 
Third, second, and first classes. 
The course in modern languages comprises instruction in French and in Spanish. 
DEPARTMENT OF PRACTICAL MILITARY ENGINEERING. 
Fourth, third, second, and first classes. 
Cadets of the fourth class receive an elementary course in theoretical surveying 
between March 15 and May 15. 
During the summer encampment cadets of the third class receive practical instruc- 
tion in the use and adjustment of surveying instruments and in surveying methods. 
In this course they apply in the field what has been taught them in their theoretical 
course of the preceding spring. 
Cadets of the second class receive, during the fall drill season, instruction in visual 
signaling, using the flag and the heliograph for sending and receiving messages. 
They are also taught to set up and adjust the heliograph and the acetylene lantern. 
During the spring period this class is instructed in the field methods of electrical 
communication and is given practice in establishing and using buzzer lines under, 
as nearly as possible, service conditions. The course also comprises setting up and 
operating field wireless telegraph outfits. During the summer encampment cadets 
of the first class are instructed in building pile, trestle, and pontoon bridges, in im- 
provising methods of crossing streams, in making road sketches, both mounted and 
dismounted, and in combined position sketching. During the fall course this class 
is given instruction in the construction and operation of appliances used in field 
engineering, in the erection of spar and trestle bridges, and in the use of explosives 
in military demolitions. The spring course is devoted to field fortification work, 
including the construction of trenches, revetments, obstacles, bombproofs, and gun 
pits; posting and distribution of working parties in the construction of saps, trenches, 
parallels, and approaches; and tracing and profiling siege works. 
DEPARTMENT OF ORDNANCE AND GUNNERY. 
First class. 
The subject of ordnance and gunnery is studied by the cadets of the first class 
throughout the academic year. The course of instruction covers the principles 
involved in the construction and use of war material. It is broadly divided into 
three parts—the theoretical, the descriptive, and the practical. The theoretical 
part includes the study of the action of explosives, the study of interior and exterior 
ballistics, the theories of gun and carriage construction, and the principles of gunnery. 
The descriptive part of the course covers the processes of manufacture of powders, 
guns, projectiles, and armor; and describes the small-arms cannon, machine and rapid- 
fire guns in use in the United States service, with the carriages, ammunition, and 
accessory appliances required for their service. The practical part of the course covers 
work with ballistic instruments and the operation of machines and appliances used 
in the fabrication of modern ordnance, the latter work being in effect a short but 
valuable course in manual training. In connection with the course, visits are 
made to Watervliet Arsenal, where the processes of gun construction are observed, 
and to the Ordnance Proving Ground at Sandy Hook, where actual firings from the 
several classes of guns are observed, including usually one or more shots against 
armor, and where the latest developments in war material are seen.

    606 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
DEPARTMENT OF MILITARY HYGIENE. 
Third class. 
The course in military hygiene begins September 1. It consists of 6 lectures and 13 
recitations. The course covers the essential points in the care of troops, particular 
attention being paid to the following: 
Personal hygiene; exercise and physical training; the selection of recruits; pre- 
ventable diseases; clothing and equipment; the water supply; foods and their 
preparation; the disposal of wastes; the sanitation of posts and barracks; the sani- 
tation of camps, marches, and battlefields; the hygiene of hot and of cold climates; 
the sanitary duties of line officers; venereal diseases; the nature and effects of alcohol 
and other narcotics. During the summer camp the first class is instructed in the 
use of the first-aid packet and the treatment of surgical emergencies. On marches, 
at the end of each day, the medical officer discusses practical matters from the point of 
view of the military sanitarian. 
DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH AND HISTORY. 
Fourth class. 
The course in English and history begins with the fourth class in September and 
continues throughout the academic year. In English the curse of instruction is 
planned to inculcate the essential principles of rhetoric, both by study of the textbook 
and by frequent practice in the various forms of composition including practice in 
personal and official correspondence, to create an intelligent appreciation of the 
best in English literature by the study of selected literary masterpieces, to impart a 
knowledge of the important facts in the history of English literature and language by 
the study of a textbook and lectures. In history the course of instruction is planned 
to acquaint the student with the political, social, and economic history from the end 
of the middle ages to the present day, to make him familiar with the fundamental 
principles of civil government, with special reference to the United States, and to 
give him knowledge of various typical forms of modern national and municipal 
governments. 
POST SCHOOLS. 
A school for the instruction of enlisted men in the common branches 
of education, and especially in the history of the United States, is 
maintained at each post. Instruction is given under the supervision 
of officers by teachers detailed from the enlisted men. Attendance 
on the part of the men is not obligatory. Schools for the instruction 
in military subjects of noncommissioned officers and specially selected 
privates are maintained in each company. Instruction is conducted 
by the company commander or by an officer of the company under 
his supervision and consists of recitations, lectures, discussions, and 
practical exercises.. The course of instruction includes Drill Regu- 
lations, Army Regulations relating to enlisted men, Minor Tactics, 
and subjects which specially pertain to the duties of noncommissioned 
officers and enlisted specialists of the arm of the service to which

Francisco, Cal.; and one at Fort Riley, Kans. Their object is to give 
practical instruction in the art of cooking and baking to classes com- 
posed of selected enlisted men. The school term is of four months’ 
duration. Upon completion of the school course, certificates of pro- 
ficiency are awarded to the students who pass a satisfactory exam- 
ination. Degrees of proficiency will be noted thereon as follows:

The Engineer Trade Schools.—The object of these schools is to train 
the enlisted men, of the Engineer Corps in the practical duties of their © 
profession. They are conducted under the supervision, of the Bat- 
talion Commander. The courses comprise instruction in carpentry, 
blacksmithing, plumbing, map making, lithography, and photography. 
THE ARMY WAR COLLEGE. 
The purpose of the War College is to make a practical application 
of knowledge already acquired, not to impart academic instruction. 
Its personnel is in part permanent and in part temporary. The 
former consists of a president, a general officer assigned to that duty 
by the Secretary of War; and a division of the General Staff; the 
latter of such officers not below the grade of captain as may be 
detailed by the War Department. Officers of the Organized Militia 
are, under certain conditions, allowed to attend. The tour of duty 
of the student officers is for a period not to exceed 12 months, 
beginning on November 1 of each year. The objects of the War 
College in detail are: 
(a) The direction and coordination of military education in the 
Army and in civil schools and colleges at which officers of the Army 
are detailed under acts of Congress, and the extension of opportunities 
for investigation and study in the militia of the United States. 
(b) To provide facilities for and to promote advanced study of 
military subjects and to formulate opinions of the college body on 
the subjects studied for the information of the Chief of Staff. 
SCHOOLS OF INSTRUCTION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. 
The object of these schools is to give to those college undeigraduates 
of the country who are desirous of accepting it the opportunity for 
a short course in military training. The course lasts five weeks and 
is held during the summer vacation period. The schools are admin- 
istered by Regular Army officers. The course comprises the following: 
(a) The theoretical principles of tactics, including advance and rear 
guards, patrols, outposts, and combat. 
(6) Military map-making and road sketching. 
(c) The use and care of the rifle. 
(d) Practical camping. 
(e) Lectures on various military subjects.

EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY. 
[Furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, at the request of the Commissioner of Education.] 
THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY. 
1. The United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., is for 
the broad purpose of educating officers for the line of the Navy. It 
was founded in 1845, and was then known as the ‘Naval School,” 
but from time to time its organization has been changed, and for a 
number of years it has been known as the ‘“‘Naval Academy.” The 
students are “‘midshipmen,” appointed by the President of the United 
States (10 annually) and by Senators and Representatives in Congress, 
each Senator and Representative being entitled to maintain two 
midshipmen at the academy. This insures that midshipmen shall 
come from every State and congressional district of the Union. One 
each is allowed also from the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii and 
from the island of Porto Rico. The number in attendance varies; 
October 1, the beginning of the present academic year, there were 
861. The course is four years, and upon its completion the graduates 
are commissioned ensigns in the Navy, or they may be commissioned 
in the Marine Corps or certain’ other staff corps of the Navy. The 
average number of graduates for the past five years has been about 
157. Examinations for admission are held on the third Tuesday in 
February and the third Tuesday in April of each year. The ques- 
tions are prepared at the Naval Academy, and the examinations are 
held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission, at a large 
number of points throughout the United States. The general scope 
of the entrance examinations is such that they should be successfully 
passed by young men who are well-grounded in high-school require- 
ments up to about the third year of high school. Briefly, the general 
character of these examinations is as follows: 
ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS, 
Reading and writing: Candidates must be able to read understandingly, and with 
proper accent and emphasis, and to write legibly, neatly, and rapidly. 
Spelling: They must be able to write from dictation a list of about 100 selected words; 
the spelling throughout the written examination is also considered in making up 
the mark for spelling; they must be familiar with the rules of punctuation and 
the use of capitals. 
Grammar: Candidates must exhibit thorough familiarity with English and grammar. 
Gecgraphy: Candidates are required to pass a satislactory examination in descriptive 
geography, particularly of our own country. Questions are given under the 
foliowing heads: Definitions of latitude and longitude, including problems with 
regard to differences of time between places; the zones; grand divisions of land 
and water; character of coast lines; and many other questions relating to principal 
rivers, tributaries, bays, gulfs, etc. The following-named textbooks are used in
-P-A-G-E-676
622 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
preparing examination questions: Mitchell’s New School Atlas; Complete Geog- 
raphy, by A. E. Fry; Natural Advanced Geography, by Redway and Hinman. 
United States history: The examination in this branch includes questions concerning 
the early settlements in this country; the forms of government in the colonies, 
the causes, leading events, and results of wars; and prominent events in the 
history of our Government since its foundation. The following-named textbooks 
are used in preparing examination questions: A Student’s History of the United 
States, by Edward Channing; The Students’ American History, by D. H. Mont- 
gomery; A School History of the United States, by John Bach McMaster. 
Arithmetic: The candidate’s knowledge of arithmetic must be accurate, including all 
the fundamental operations and principles. In other words, he must possess 
such a complete knowledge of arithmetic as will enable him to proceed at once to 
the higher branches of mathematics without further study of arithmetic. The 
required ground is completely covered by any one of the following textbooks: 
Advanced Arithmetic, by G. A Wentworth (first 16 chapters); A High School 
Arithmetic, by Wentworth and Hill; Standard Arithmetic, by William J. Milne; 
Arithmetic in Theory and Practice, by J. Brook-Smith. 
Algebra: The examination in algebra includes questions and problems upon the 
fundamental rules, factoring, greatest common divisor, least common multiple, 
algebraic fractions, equations of the first degree, with one or more unknown 
quantities, simplification of expressions involving surds, and the solution and 
theory of quadratic equations, problems involving the formation of simple and 
quadratic equations, and the meaning and law of exponents, positive, negative, 
and fractional. The requirements are fully expressed in Wentworth’s College 
Algebra (Revised), first 14 chapters, or Wentworth’s Elementary Algebra, first 21 
chapters; Milne’s Academic Algebra, 324 pages. 
Geometry: In geometry, candidates are required to give accurate definitions of terms 
used in plane geometry, to demonstrate any proposition of plane geometry as given 
in the ordinary textbooks, and to solve simple geometrical problems, either by a 
construction or by anapplication ofalgebra. Either of the following textbooks cover 
the ground required in geometry: Wentworth and Hill’s Plane and Solid Geo- 
metry (5 books); Robbin’s Plane Geometry; Chauvenet’s Geometry (5 books). 
Candidates are required to be of good moral character, physically 
sound, well formed, and of a robust constitution. After having 
successfully passed the mental requirements, they are examined at 
the Naval Academy by a board of medical officers, the physical 
examination being most thorough. In order to save those who have 
disqualifying physical defects the expense of traveling from their 
homes to the Naval Academy for this physical examination, arrange- 
ments have been made for a preliminary examination of candidates 
at various naval stations and recruiting offices, fairly well distributed 
throughout the United States. This preliminary examination will 
not entitle the candidate to entrance, as he must subsequently be 
examined by the statutory medical board at Annapolis, but its effect 
would be to detect disqualifying defects, which would render it useless 
for the candidate to go to the Naval Academy; or it might bring to 
light a temporary defect which after proper treatment would no 
longer be disqualifying. Candidates must be unmarried, and any 
midshipman who shall marry, or who shall be found to be married 
before his graduation, will be dismissed from the service.

POSTGRADUATE COURSES. 
2. In 1904, postgraduate instruction in ordnance and in steam 
engineering was established, as a result of the recommendation of 
the chiefs of the Bureaus of Navigation, Ordnance, and Steam 
Engineering. As a result of this, 35 student officers have taken the 
ordnance course, and 9 are now thus engaged. Eight student officers 
took the engineering course prior to 1909, when the School of Marine 
Engineering was established at Annapolis, Md. From this school 17 
officers have been graduated. 
In 1912 the postgraduate department of the Naval Academy was 
formed, into which the School of Marine Engineering was naturally 
merged. Twenty-eight student officers have taken, or are taking, 
the course in marine engineering, which is divided into four specialties: 
Marine engine design, electricity, radio, and shop management. The 
first year’s work is done at the Naval Academy, and the second at 
Columbia University. The ordnance, naval construction, and civil 
engineering student officers take the review course at the postgraduate
-P-A-G-E-678
624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
department before taking their special course at the gun factory, 
powder factory, and armor plants (in the case of ordnance students), 
and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Troy Poly- 
technic Institute in the case of the naval constructors and civil 
engineers, respectively. The object of establishing this postgraduate 
course was to enable young officers to obtain intimate scientific 
knowledge of the subjects indicated above, with a view to becoming 
specialists in some one or more of these subjects. The knowledge 
gained from the postgraduate course is expected to be further utilized 
by continued study and application by the officers along the lines in 
which they intend to specialize. 
THE NAVAL WAR COLLEGE, NEWPORT, R. I. 
3. The Naval War College is for the purpose of teaching officers the 
art of naval warfare. Under this heading may be specified strategy, 
tactics, military policy, military character, organization, administra- 
tion, strategic studies of campaigns, tactical studies of battles, plan- 
making, logistics, bases, building program, and allied topics. Owing 
to a scarcity of officers who could be spared to attend the War Col- 
lege, the course there has been somewhat irregular, and up to the 
present has consisted of (1) a short course of 4 months, beginning 
June 1 and ending September 30, and (2) a long course of about 16 
months. But few officers so far have completed the long course. At 
present there are about 20 officers at the War College who will com- 
plete a course of about one year. It is probable that the long course 
will be abolished, and that the course for one year will be made stand- 
ard. The work of instruction at the War College is conducted by a 
line officer of high rank who is detailed as president, assisted by a staft 
of several officers, who have specialized more or less in the subjects 
of instruction. 
TRAINING STATIONS AND SCHOOLS. 
4. The Navy maintains four stations for training newly enlisted 
recruits, located, respectively, at Newport, R. I., Norfolk, Va., 
Great Lakes, Ill., and San Francisco, Cal. The course of training 
usually covers about three months, after which the apprentice sea- 
men, are rated ordinary seamen. or coal passers, and transferred to the 
general service. During the fiscal year approximately 5,855 ordinary 
seamen and 1,368 coal passers were rated and sent to sea, and 2,720 
remained under instruction at the end of the year. At three of these 
training stations, namely, Newport, Norfolk, and Great Lakes, a 
school system has been inaugurated, and it will soon be extended to 
the fourth station. Until very recently academic education has not 
been a part of the training station’s system, but within the past few 
months this has been made an important part of the training. It is 
again referred to in another part of this report. 
   
-P-A-G-E-679
  THE UNITED STATES NAVY—EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. 625 
YEOMAN SCHOOLS. 
5. It may be explained that yeomen are rated enlisted men of the 
Navy, who perform clerical work, including typewriting and stenog- 
raphy, on board ship and at naval stations. There are two yeoman 
schools, one at Newport, R. I., and the other at San Francisco, Cal. 
These schools are divided into two branches, accounting and corre- 
spondence. Recruits who have had clerical experience and pass the 
necessary preliminary examination are sent to the yeoman school 
upon enlistment, as well as enlisted men who are recommended by 
their commanding officers for this instruction. During the fiscal 
year approximately 223 men completed the course and were rated 
yeomen, while 100 remain under instruction. 
MUSICIANS’ SCHOOLS. 
6. Three schools for musicians are maintained, at Norfolk, Va. 
(where the largest number of men are instructed), at Newport, R. I., 
and San Francisco, Cal. Musicians who enlist are detailed for in- 
struction as musicians in the service. During the fiscal year approxi- 
mately 247 men completed this course of instruction, and 113 re- 
mained under instruction. 
COMMISSARY SCHOOLS. 
7. There are two schools, one located at Newport, R. I., and the 
other at San Francisco, Cal. The instruction is divided into three 
branches, one in which men are instructed in the duties of commis- 
sary stewards, another the cooking class, and the other the baking 
class. Since the establishment of the schools for instruction of 
cooks and bakers the service has been greatly benefited, and there 
is less dissatisfaction with the food, owing to the uniform method of 
cooking which now exists. During the past fiscal year approxi- 
mately 157 men completed the instruction at the three schools, while 
74 remained under instruction. 
ARTIFICER SCHOOL. 
8. At the artificer school, which is located at Norfolk, Va., men 
are taught the work of the blacksmith, plumber and fitter, painter, 
shipfitter, carpenter’s mate, or shipwright, etc. The course usually 
lasts three months. During the fiscal year approximately 163 men 
completed this course of instruction, and 80 remained under 
instruction. 
ELECTRICAL SCHOOLS. 
9. There are two electrical schools, which are located at Mare 
Island, Cal., and at the navy yard, New York, respectively. The 
17726°—xp 1918—vor 1——40  
-P-A-G-E-680
  626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
instruction in these schools is divided into two branches, one for 
general electricians and the other for radio electricians. This divi- 
sion of instruction enables the men to do a greater amount of study 
on the particular branch. in which they are specializing, with the 
result that more competent electricians of both kinds are turned out. 
During the fiscal year approximately 365 men completed the elec- 
trical course and were transferred to general service, while 248 re- 
mained under instruction. 
MACHINIST’S MATES’ SCHOOL. 
10. This school was originally established at the navy yard at 
Norfolk, and was transferred to the navy yard at Charleston, S. C., 
in the early part of 1912. The course of instruction covers a period 
of 16 months, and its purpose is to turn out competent machinists 
to supply the great need that exists for men of this class on board 
modern vessels. The equipment of the school consists of lathes, 
shapers, milling machines, drill press, and boring machines, with 
coppersmith, machinist, and tinning benches. During the fiscal 
year approximately 150 men completed this course of instruction, 
and 140 remained under instruction. 
SEAMEN GUNNER SCHOOLS. 
11. There are two seamen gunner schools, one at Newport, R. I., 
where instruction in torpedoes is given, and the other at the navy 
yard, Washington, D. C., where the men are instructed in general 
ordnance work. During the fiscal year approximately 313 men 
completed the instruction in these two schools, while 210 remained 
under instruction. Only continuous-service men—that is, those men 
who reenlist within four months after receiving honorable discharge 
at the expiration of previous enlistment—are permitted to go to 
the machinist’s mates’ school or to the seamen gunner schools. 
AVIATION SCHOOL. 
12. There is a school or camp of instruction in aviation at present 
located at Annapolis, Md. It is not permanently located anywhere, 
but moves to Guantanamo or other places as circumstances render it 
advisable. Only officers are permitted to fly at present, but enlisted 
men are employed in connection with the work and the care, repair, 
and upkeep of the machines. There is under consideration the 
establishment of an aeronautic center where comprehensive instruc- 
tion will be carried on and will include work with dirigibles as well 
as that with aeroplanes.

Navat Epucationat System In ‘THE FLEet. 
SCHOOLS ON BOARD SHIP. 
13. The following plan for the instruction of enlisted men, petty 
officers, and warrant officers of the Navy serving on board ship was 
put into effect January 1, 1914, with a view to supplying deficien- 
cies in academic education, and also to provide systematic means by 
which all enlisted men and warrant officers may receive assistance 
and encouragement in technical branches in order to fit them for 
‘promotion in the Navy, as well as for civil trades at the end of their 
period of service afloat. 
14. The instruction under the two heads—academic and technical 
or professional—is under the general charge of the executive officer, 
assisted by all commissioned officers and by such warrant and petty 
officers as are necessary in the different departments on board ship. 
15. Division officers are required to carefully examine all men 
under their supervision, noting the deficiencies of each man, the 
amount of instruction he may have rezcived at the training station, 
the branches in which further instruction is most needed, the fitness 
of each man for promotion, the branch for which he is best suited, 
and the personal preferences and ambitions of each individual, in 
order that classes may be formed to secure progress and improvement 
in the mental and technical training of men in every branch of the 
Navy service.   
THE ROUTINE ON BOARD SHIP. 
16. The routine on board ship is so arranged that the following 
general principle, as regards the employment of the men, may be 
followed as far as possible: 
(1) To 9.15, cleaning and shipwork (all hands); 
(2) 9.15 to 11.45, drills and routine duties; 
(3) 11.45 to 1.15, dinner and recreation; 
(4) 1.15 to 2.30, instruction and school; 
(5) 2.30 to 4.30, drill, ship work, and recreation. 
17. No work is required during the instruction period, except 
in cases of emergency or necessity, this period being devoted to the 
self-improvement of every man in the ship and to the instruction of 
those who are ambitious for immediate or ultimate promotion. It 
is an ‘‘all hands” period of study and instruction. 
18. Whenever the weather or the circumstances of service of any 
particular ship or ships are such that additional time during the day 
may be given to instruction, commanding officers will be urged to 
increase the periods of instruction and to encourage night classes 
when practicable. In case climatic or other conditions demand a 
change in the routine or a different hour for instruction, the com-
-P-A-G-E-682
628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
manding officer will depart from the routine as prescribed above, 
keeping in mind, however, the object to be attained and the progress 
that must be assured. 
ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT. 
19. The instruction in this department will be required of all en- 
- listed men as they come from the training schools or from enlistment, 
and of all men in the first two years of their enlistment. Until other- 
wise ordered, the academic instruction as to other enlisted men will be 
voluntary as a rule, but the commanding officer may compel men who — 
are deficient to take such instruction as may be necessary to bring them 
to a proper and reasonable standard in elementary branches. The 
subjects embraced in this department will be reading, writing, arithme- 
tic, spelling, geography, and history. A certain number of textbooks 
on these subjects will be furnished by the Navy Department and will 
be kept in the crew’s library, and all books in the library will be uti- 
lized as far as possible. The scope of the work in each branch of study 
will be decided by circumstances. The men should be interested in 
the geography of the whole world to a certain extent, and it is the 
intention of the department strongly to emphasize the history of our 
own country and of the United States Navy, and of our naval cam- 
paigns and battles. Officers who serve as instructors in each division. 
will be requested to assist any men who wish to take up algebra, 
higher mathematics, and other academic branches not included in 
the elementary school, utilizing preferably textbooks both academic 
and technical, which may be in use at the Naval Academy. 
CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS. 
20. An officer on board ship will be assigned to supervise and assist 
the work of all enlisted men who, by reason of their initiative and 
ambition, may have taken up correspondence courses with outside 
institutions. It is not the intention to interfere with the freedom 
of action of individuals in such matters, but rather to encourage and 
advise them particularly until such time as the perfection of service 
schools may, perhaps, in the estimation of the men themselves, serve 
to meet all their requirements and satisfy all their needs. This, then, 
will be considered a distinct department and will be assigned a sepa- 
rate, suitable part of the ship during the school period. 
WARRANT OFFICERS’ SCHOOLS. 
21, All warrant officers who may be eligible and wish to prepare 
for examination for a commission in the Navy will be encouraged by 
their commanding officer, who will afford them all possible facilities
-P-A-G-E-683
  THE UNITED STATES NAVY—EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. 629 
for study and will assign a competent officer to superintend their 
instruction. 
CHIEF PETTY OFFICERS’ SCHOOL. 
22. All chief petty officers and others who may aspire to warrant 
rank will be formed into a class for instruction, and an instructor will 
be detailed to assist them in preparing for the examination. 
COMMISSARY AND PAY DEPARTMENT SCHOOL. 
23. Enlisted men in the commissary branch, pay department, or 
other divisions on board ship, who*may wish to prepare themselves 
for promotion to commissary steward, or to qualify eventually for 
pay clerks or for a commission as paymaster in the Navy, will receive 
every encouragement and assistance. It is the intention to prepare 
for this purpose suitable manuals, and those books now in existence 
will be revised to meet future requirements. The pay officers, 
clerks, stewards, and cooks on board ship will act as instructors in 
these branches. 
SCHOOL FOR HOSPITAL BRANCH. 
24. The department will also encourage a'l men in the hospital 
branch of the service to seek promotion in their corps, and all availa- 
ble manuals and treatises in first aid, hygiene, and other subjects 
necessary to qualify men for advancement to the rate of hospital 
steward and pharmacist will be utilized. 
MAN-OF-WAR AND MILITARY INSTRUCTION. 
25. It is the intention definitely to prescribe the necessary quali- 
fications for ordinary seaman, seaman, boatswain’s mates, and all 
other petty officers or chief petty officers; and every man in those 
ratings, or who may seek promotion to them, will be required to 
study and fit himself to attain the required standard. In order to 
secure uniformity throughout the Navy and to perfect the training 
of our men, it is proposed to revise and rearrange the Bluejacket’s 
Manual, the different chapters of which may treat of the duties of 
the several rates in the Navy, every man being required to study 
and qualify himself thoroughly on all subjects contained in the 
chapter devoted to his particular rate. It is intended to give a 
certain amount of suitable instruction along naval lines to all men, 
regardless of rate, including barbers, bandsmen, mess attendants, 
and others who ordinarily receive no instruction whatever outside 
their daily routine duties.
-P-A-G-E-684
630 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
MARINE SCHOOL. 
26. A school, or scheme of instruction, similar to the foregoing, 
will be prescribed for marines ashore and afloat, by the Major General 
Commandant of the Marine Corps, and approved by the Secretary of 
the Navy. 
TECHNICAL AND TRADE BRANCHES. 
27. Under this head are included all the skilled and mechanical 
trades in the engineer, electrical, and other departments of a modern 
ship—machinists, coppersmiths, boilermakers, blacksmiths, water 
tenders, oilers, electricians, wireless operators, stenographers, type- 
writers, carpenters, painters, etc. A manual or manuals, similar in 
character to the Bluejacket’s Manual, will be provided to deal with 
all these subjects. Certain handbooks now available fulfill the 
requirements to a certain degree, and by revision and amplification 
these books may easily be perfected and kept up to date. 
REPORTS. 
28. The Navy Department will prescribe systems of reports at 
least quarterly, from all ships, in order that conditions as to progress 
and the necessity for changes and improvements may be noted. 
INDIAN EDUCATION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 1913. 
(Furnished by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, at the request of the Commissioner of Education.) 
During the year the Government maintained 37 nonreservation 
boarding schools, with an enrollment of 10,702; 74 reservation board- 
ing schools, with an enrollment of 9,523; and 216 day schools, with an 
enrollment of 7,356, an increase over the previous year of more than 
3,000 pupils. This increase was due to the activities of Indian school 
officials in encouraging Indian children to enter school, and to the 
growing interest in the educational welfare of their children mani- 
fested by Indian parents. 
The academic work at each Indian school is modeled upon the 
course of study in use in the public schools of the State in which the 
school is located. This course of study is, however, modified so as to 
give very greatly increased attention to industrial training. The 
economic independence of the Indian must come as a result of indus- 
trial and vocational training of the boys and girls. The entire Indian 
school system is organized and conducted with this end in view. 
During the first years in school, which are spent in day schools, girl 
pupils are taught basketry, mat weaving, simple sewing, and the per- 
formance of minor duties in connection with the care of the house- 
hold. The boys are taught gardening, the use of simple tools, and the
-P-A-G-E-685

care of stock. In the reservation boarding school the girls are taught 
regular household duties, sewing, laundering, and baking; the boys 
are taught regular shop work, the cultivation of the soil, dairying and 
stock raising, a farm being conducted at each reservation boarding 
school. 
At the nonreservation boarding schools the girls are instructed in 
domestic science, and as an aid to this instruction there is frequently 
provided a domestic science cottage wherein a definite course in the 
household arts may be taken, each girl living for a time in this cottage 
and performing all the household duties under the direction of a com- 
petent instructor. In some of the larger boarding schools an ‘‘outing 
system” is maintained. Under this system the boy or girl is sent to 
the home of a reputable and industrious family where the boy assists 
with the farm work under the direction of the farmer, or the girl is 
taken into the house to assist in the household work, care of poultry 
and dairy products, under the direction of the farmer’s wife. The 
pupil often has an opportunity to attend a public school near the farm 
home, the academic training being thus continued while the pupil gains 
practical farm experience in farm work. 
The nonreservation boarding schools afford an opportunity for 
Indian pupils to learn various trades by which they can become self- 
supporting, if circumstances or their own desires do not tend to make 
farmers of them. Instruction is given in carpentering, woodworking, 
blacksmithing, electrical and stationary engineering, brick and stone 
masonry, plumbing, tailoring, painting, printing, baking, harness and 
shoemaking, wagon making, and cement work. 
In some schools small tracts of land are set apart on the farm for 
one or two boys to cultivate. Each tract is charged with all expenses 
necessary to put it into proper cultivation, purchase seeds, etc., 
and the labor of tending the crops, and is oredited with the returns. 
This teaches the pupil to plan his season’s work as would be necessary 
were he placed upon his own resources with his own farm. 
The health of the pupil is a question of primary importance, and 
it receives constant attention in every school. Physicians are 
stationed at practically every boarding school, and sick pupils are 
promptly and carefully treated. A number of hospitals have been 
constructed, and there are a few sanatoria wherein pupils with in- 
cipient tuberculosis may receive academic and industrial training 
suited to their condition, while they are under the direct care of a 
physician. Gymnasiums have been constructed at many schools, 
particularly in the Northern States, where the winters are long and 
opportunities for outdoor exercise limited. The pupils are taught 
the great value of fresh air in the preservation of health, and screened 
sleeping porches are built where conditions permit their use. Board- 
ing schools are not permitted to retain pupils unless there is sufficient 
air space in the dormitory to allow at least 500 cubic feet per pupil.
-P-A-G-E-686
632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
It has been the continuous practice of the Indian Bureau to assign 
the duty of supervising Indian schools to supervisors of broad edu- 
cational attainments and industrial equipment, familiar with the 
peculiar problems which arise in adapting the school system of the 
whites to the educational necessities of Indian youth. The super- 
visor of Indian employment, an Indian himself, is charged with the 
important duty of following up returned students. He is in touch 
with various business enterprises which furnish employment for 
Indians who do not care to take up the actual farming of their 
allotments. 
The educational work for the Indian does not cease with his return 
from the Government school. The reservation superintendent is re- 
quired to keep in touch with returned students and to see that they 
are encouraged, with the aid of the Government farmer, to develop 
their allotments into a means of support, or to get them started in 
some other gainful occupation which will render them self-supporting- 
Through the supervisor of Indian employment and the superin- 
tendent of the reservations upon which returned students make their 
homes the work of the Government school is continued and made of 
lasting benefit. Each of the various activities of school and reserva- 
tion work is under the direction of a supervisor of long training and 
experience in his particular field, and thus each branch of the work 
receives expert attention and is woven into the general plans of the 
Indian Office to raise Indian civilization to a higher plane. 
EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA. 
Report by Wiu1am T. Lorp, 
Superintendent of Education of Natives of Alaska. 
CHARACTER OF THE WORK. 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1913, the field force of the 
Alaska school service consisted of 5 superintendents, 109 teachers, 
11 physicians (1 of whom also filled another position), 9 nurses, and 
8 hospital attendants. Seventy-seven schools were maintained with 
an enrollment of 3,563, and an average attendance of 1,797. 
In Alaska there are, approximately, 25,000 natives in villages 
ranging from 30 or 40 up to 300 or 400 persons, scattered along 
thousands of miles of coast line and on the great rivers. Some of the 
villages on remote islands or on the frozen ocean are brought into 
touch with the outside world only once or twice a year, when visited 
by a United States revenue cutter on its annual cruise or by the 
   
-P-A-G-E-687
  EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA. 633 
supply vessel sent by the Bureau of Education. During eight months 
of the year all of the villages in Alaska, with the exception of those on 
the southern coast, are reached only by trails over the snow-covered 
land or frozen rivers. In spite of the difficulties of the problem a 
United States public school has been established in each of 77 villages. 
In many instances the school is the only elevating power in the native 
community. 
Every teacher is a social worker, who, in addition to performing 
the routine work in the schoolroom, strives in every possible way to 
promote the physical, moral, and industrial welfare of the natives, 
adults as well as children. In the school rooms the endeavor is made 
to impart to the children such instruction as will enable them to live 
comfortably and to deal intelligently with those with whom they 
come in contact; instruction in carpentry, cooking, and sewing is 
emphasized. Each schoolhouse is a social center for the accom- 
plishment of practical ends. Many of the buildings contain, in 
addition to the recitation room, an industrial room, kitchen, quarters 
of the teacher, and a laundry and baths for the use of the native 
community. The schoolroom is available for public meetings for 
discussion of affairs of the village or, occasionally, for social purposes. 
In the native villages the teachers and nurses endeavor to establish 
proper sanitary conditions by inspecting the houses, by insisting 
upon proper disposal of garbage, and by giving instruction in sanitary 
methods of living. Natives are encouraged to replace their filthy 
huts by neat, well-ventilated houses. In some sections the natives 
have been taught to raise vegetables, which are a healthful addition 
to their usual diet of fish and meat. 
There are extensive regions in which the services of a physician are 
not obtainable. Accordingly, it often becomes the duty of a teacher 
to treat minor ailments, to render first aid to the injured, or to care 
for a patient through the course of a serious illness. 
In its endeavor to safeguard the health of the natives of Alaska, the 
Bureau of Education maintains four small hospitals in important 
centers of native population; contracts with three hospitals for the 
treatment of diseased natives; employs traveling physicians who 
devote their entire time to medical and sanitary work among the 
natives in their respective districts; employs nurses who assist the 
physicians and do exceedingly valuable work among the children and 
in the villages; and provides medical supplies and textbooks to the 
teachers to enable them to treat minor ailments and intelligently to 
supervise hygienic measures. The entire medical and sanitary work 
of the Bureau of Education in Alaska is under the supervision of an 
officer of the Public Health Service on special detail. 
For the immediate supervision of its work among the natives of 
Alaska, the Bureau of Education depends upon its five district super-   
     
-P-A-G-E-688
  634 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
intendents, men of proved ability and fidelity, who, under the pro- 
visions of the rules regulating the service, have the greatest freedom 
of action consistent with the ultimate responsibility of the Commis- 
sioner of Education. 
MEDICAL WORK. 
Among the most urgent needs of the natives of Alaska is protection 
against the diseases which prevail among them to an alarming extent. 
There is no specific appropriation for the support of medical work 
among the natives of Alaska. For several years the Bureau of Edu- 
cation has been striving, without success, to secure funds for the 
establishment of well-equipped hospitals and for the employment of 
a sufficient number of physicians and nurses. Under the terms of the 
appropriation for ‘Education of Natives of Alaska’ the Bureau of 
Education can employ physicians and nurses for work among the 
Alaska natives, but it can not erect the hospitals which are greatly 
needed. Of the appropriation for the education of natives of Alaska 
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, $31,758.13 was expended for 
medical work, including: (1) The maintenance of hospitals in rented 
buildings at Juneau and Nushagak; (2) the maintenance of impro- 
vised hospitals in school buildings at Nulato and Kotzebue; (3) pay- 
ments under contract with the Holy Cross Hospital at Nome, with the 
Fairhaven Hospital at Candle, and with the Cordova Hospital for the 
treatment of diseased natives upon the application of a superintend- 
ent, physician, or teacher in the Alaska school service; (4) the em- 
ployment of physicians and nurses in the hospitals and in fieldwork 
in their respective districts, and (5) furnishing medicines and medical 
books to the teachers for use in relieving minor ailments. Nearly 1,800 
cases were treated in the hospitals at Juneau, Nushagak, Nulato, and 
Kotzebue during 1912-13. The most prevalent diseases were tuber- 
culosis, trachoma, rheumatism, and venereal diseases; the surgical 
operations included excisions for tabercular diseases of the bones, the 
removal of tubercular glands, laparotomies, curetting of ulcers, setting 
broken bones, sewing up recent wounds, and excisions of hemor- 
rhoids, cataracts, abscesses, tonsils, and adenoids. During the year 
epidemics of infantile paralysis at St. Michael and of diphtheria at 
Nulato were checked by physicians employed by the Bureau of Edu- 
ation. At Nulato, under the provisions of the health law passed by 
the Alaska Territorial Legislature at its first session, Dr. Bruce H. 
Brown established effective quarantine. In March, 1912, upon the 
request of the Secretary of the Interior, Passed Asst. Surg. Emil 
Krulish, of the Public Health Service, was detailed for service in 
Alaska, in order that the medical work among the natives might have 
expert supervision. Dr. Krulish spent from April to November 
investigating health conditions in the native settlements in south-
-P-A-G-E-689
  
EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA, 635 
eastern Alaska, in western Alaska as far as Cook’s Inlet, on the Yukon 
River, and in the vicinity of Nome. In his report Dr. Krulish states 
that in his opinion 15 per cent of the native population of Alaska is 
infected with tuberculosis in its varying forms, both active and latent, 
while in 7 per cent it is present in its active stages. Trachoma, rheu- 
matism, and venereal diseases also prevail to a considerable extent 
in many of the native villages. 
An appropriation of at least $125,000 is needed to establish an 
Alaska medical service with an efficient organization for the natives 
of Alaska. The good results already accomplished by the present 
inadequate service demonstrate that disease among the natives of 
Alaska can be eradicated if funds are provided for the establishment 
of well-equipped hospitals in important centers and for the employ- 
ment of a sufficient number of physicians and nurses. 
RESERVATIONS. 
Experience has proved the wisdom of reserving, in certain localities, 
tracts of land exclusively for the use of the natives of Alaska, where, 
secure from the evil influence of unprincipled white men, the natives 
can build up their own industries. By Executive order, June 19, 
1912, a tract of approximately 12 square miles on the west coast of 
Prince of Wales Island, in southeastern Alaska, was reserved for the 
use of a colony of natives who had migrated thither from the viilages 
of Klinquan and Howkan and founded a settlement which they 
named Hydaburg. Under the supervision of the teacher of the 
United States public school the Hydaburg Trading Co. was organized 
to transact the mercantile business of the settlement and the Hyda- 
burg Lumber Co. to operate a sawmill. These enterprises have been 
eminently successful. The prosperity of the Hydaburg colony 
caused the natives of Klukwan and of Klawock, in southeastern 
Alaska, to desire similar reservations upon which to conduct their 
own enterprises. By Executive order, April 21, 1913, a tract with 
an approximate area of 800 acres, bordering the Chilkat River, was 
reserved for the exclusive use of the Klukwan natives. Much of this 
land has agricultural value, and gardening will be systematically 
taught by the teacher of the United States public school. The pro- 
posed reservation at Klawock is within the Tongass National Forest; 
negotiations are.in progress with the Forest Service for its reservation. 
ECONOMIC AID TO NATIVES. 
The reindeer service —A very important part of the work of the 
Bureau of Education for the natives of Alaska is the assistance 
rendered them in their economic and industrial development. Fore- 
most among the enterprises undertaken in this direction is the rein- 
   
-P-A-G-E-690
636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
deer service, which in the 20 years of its existence has become a vast 
wealth-producing native industry in northern and western Alaska. 
At an average of $25 per head the 24,068 reindeer owned by the 
natives June 30, 1912, represented a capital of $601,700. The total 
income of the natives from the reindeer industry during the same 
fiscal year was $44,885, exclusive of the value of the meat and hides 
used by the natives themselves. 
Cooperative stores—Throughout Alaska there are in small native 
villages some traders who charge exorbitant prices for the imported 
food and clothing which, with the changing environment, have un- 
fortunately become necessities of life for the natives. Valuable furs 
and other native products are frequently bartered for imported goods 
at rates which keep the natives hopelessly in debt to the traders. 
In very many villages there are less than 100 natives; even the 
legitimate freight and profit which any trader must charge is a heavy 
burden on such small settlements. The Bureau of Education there- 
fore fosters the establishment of cooperative stores owned and 
managed by the natives themselves. By thus relieving themselves 
of the burden of the profit exacted by the middleman the natives 
are able to secure the necessities of life at the lowest prices and can 
at their own local stores obtain equitable value for their furs, ivory, 
woven baskets, and other native products. The wisdom of the 
policy of thus assisting the natives to help themselves has been 
especially demonstrated at Hydaburg, in southeastern Alaska, where, 
under the general oversight of the teacher, the native management 
of the cooperative store, after 12 months of existence, was able to 
declare a cash dividend of 50 per cent and still had funds available 
toward the erection and equipment of a larger store building. Native 
stores have for several years been successfully conducted at Wales 
and Gambell in northern Alaska. 
For many years economic conditions have been especially deplor- 
able among the natives of Atka, a remote island in the Aleutian 
chain, visited only by one of the revenue cutters on its annual cruise 
and by a trading schooner. On this untimbered island the local 
price for rough lumber was $50 per thousand and $8 per thousand 
for shingles, with proportionate charges for the articles of clothing 
and for the food supplies kept by the local trader. For each of 
the skins of the few blue foxes caught the natives received from 
the trader goods averaging $8 in value. In Seattle, rough lumber 
sells for $12 per thousand, and shingles at $2.25 per thousand, and 
the blue foxes sent out by the Atka natives during the summer of 
1913 brought at public auction in Seattle from $17.10 to $66.50 each, 
according to quality. In April, 1913, it was found possible, with 
' the cooperation of the Revenue-Cutter Service and philanthropic 
merchants in Seattle, to aid the natives of Atka to establish their 
 
-P-A-G-E-691
  EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA, 637 
own store. The merchants consented to advance the original stock 
for the store to the value of about $1,500, and measuring approxi- 
mately 15 tons, which the Revenue-Cutter Service delivered at Atka 
free of charge. Under the direction of the teacher, a local coopera- 
tive company was organized and the natives will as rapidly as possible 
pay the Seattle merchants for the goods advanced. Detailed reports 
of the operations of the company will be submitted to the chief of 
the Alaska Division, and, with the approval of the Treasury Depart- 
ment, the commanding officer of the revenue cutter visiting Atka 
will audit, from time to time, all financial transactions connected 
with the enterprise and aid in every way in its successful operation. 
Sale of native products—One of the problems of the work has been 
to provide a market for the furs and ivory obtained by the Eskimos 
on the shores of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean and in other remote 
regions. Formerly it was possible for these natives to dispose of their 
wares only to local traders. With the extension of the mail service, 
many natives now forward by mail packages of fox, lynx, mink, and 
hair seal to the supply and disbursing office of the Alaska Division 
in Seattle, which, through the Seattle Fur Sales Agency, sells the furs 
by public auction to the highest bidder. The net proceeds of furs, 
ivory, and whalebone sold in Seattle for the natives during the fiscal 
year ended June 30, 1913, was $4,144. 
Salmon industry.—A successful experiment in salting and exporting 
salmon bellies was conducted by the natives of Tatitlek during the 
summer of 1913, under the instruction and supervision of the teacher. 
In the spring a wholesale dealer in salt fish in Seattle furnished to the 
Tatitlek natives 100 barrels of salt for guaranteed prices on the various 
species of salmon; the Bureau of Education provided the fishing 
equipment, including one drag seine and two gill nets. As a result 
of the season’s work, 130 barrels of salted salmon bellies have been 
sent to Seattle by the Tatitlek natives, which will net them more than 
$1,000. The law requires that the natives must preserve the backs 
of the fish and use them for food. Accordingly, as the result of this 
undertaking, the Tatitlek natives will have, in addition to the cash 
received, approximately 75,000 smoked salmon for winter use. 
LEGISLATION. 
Among the most urgent needs of the work of the Bureau of Edu- 
cation for the natives of Alaska have been (1) legislation compelling 
regular attendance in the schools, (2) legislation giving the employees 
of the Bureau of Education in Alaska power legally to enforce in the 
native villages obedience to their instructions with reference to 
matters relating to health, and (3) legislation regulating the civic 
rights of the natives. It is gratifying that at its first session the 
Alaska Territorial Legislature took action regarding two of these
-P-A-G-E-692
    638 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
matters. The compulsory school attendance law makes attendance 
obligatory upon all native children between the ages of 8 and 16 
(unless physically or mentally incapacitated) residing within 1 mile of a 
United States public school. 
The law regulating the registration and restriction of communicable 
diseases in Alaska provides that in any native village any representa- 
tive of the Bureau of Education shall have power as health officer 
to enforce quarantine regulations, to cause garbage to be removed, 
to disinfect persons, houses, or property, and to cause furniture or 
household goods to be destroyed when they are a menace to the 
public health. Violations of the regulations made or disobedience 
of orders given under the authority of this law are punishable by a 
fine not exceeding $100 or by imprisonment for not more than 50 
days, or by both fine and imprisonment. The Territorial legislature 
also passed a bill to amend the Penal Code of Alaska, making the 
soliciting, purchasing, or receiving of liquor by a native a criminal 
offense. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
1. Medical relief—Adequate and special provision for the medical 
and sanitary relief of the Eskimos, Indians, Aleuts, and other natives 
of Alaska is imperative. Most of these natives live in villages far 
away from any white settlement in which there is a practicing physi- 
cien, and must depend on Government physicians, nurses, and teach- 
ers for ordinary medical attention and care. The use of part of the 
educational appropriation for medical relief is an emergency measure 
dictated by the absolute necessity for action. The entire appropria- 
tion is urgently needed for the support of the schools and to promote 
the industrial development of the natives. Under a decision of the 
comptroller this appropriation can not be used in erecting hospitals. 
Without hospitals for the segregation and proper care of natives 
afflicted with tuberculosis, trachoma, and other communicable dis- 
eases, it is impossible to reduce their prevalency. An appropriation 
of at least $125,000 is needed to establish a medical service among the 
natives of Alaska with an efficient organization. This is a matter of 
vital importance not only to the natives, but also to white settiers in 
Alaska. 
2. Legislation regulating the civic rights of the natives.—Provision 
should be made for the acquiring of citizenship by properly qualified 
natives. At the first session of the Territorial legislature a bill was 
introduced creating a board of Indian commissioners in each judicial 
district (of which board the superintendent of the United States pub- 
lic schools residing in each judicial district should be a member ex 
officio) and providing that said board, upon application in due form, 
shall issue certificates of citizenship to natives found to be qualified.
-P-A-G-E-693
EDUCATION OF NATIVES OF ALASKA. 639 
The native applying for citizenship must, under oath, renounce his 
adherence to tribal customs. No certificate of citizenship should be 
issued to a native unable to read and write the English language. 
This bill failed of passage, and I urge that it receive favorable con- 
sideration by the Territorial legislature at its next session. 
8. Transportation.—I repeat my recommendation that the Bureau 
ot Education should own and maintain a light-draft, seagoing power 
schooner, capable of carrying from 250 to 300 tons, in which to trans- 
port teachers, building materials, and school supplies from Seattle to 
the remote schools on Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The pos- 
session of such a vessel would enable the Bureau of Education to 
carry its employees to and from its numerous schools remote from 
the regular lines of travel with some degree of safety and comfort. 
The responsibility of sending teachers across the Pacific Ocean in 
such small, uncomfortable, and heavily laden vessels as have hitherto 
been used has caused the officials of the Alaska division no small 
degree of uneasiness. The present arrangement is expensive. In a 
few years such a vessel as is desired would pay for itself in the saving 
of freight charges alone. Moreover, it would provide satisfactory 
means of summer inspection by superintendent and physician, and, 
being under the complete control of the bureau, these officials could 
take sufficient time to perform their duties thoroughly in the various 
villages visited. In addition to transporting passengers and freight, 
such a vessel would be very useful also as a means of instructing 
natives in navigation, engineering, and seamanship. By its use it 
would also be possible economically to supply the natives in the 
untimbered regions with materials for use in constructing sanitary 
houses, and to aid them in developing fishing industries. Of the 
25,000 natives in Alaska, at least 20,000 live near salt water. 
4. Appropriations.—It is only during July, August, and September 
that supplies can be delivered at places in the interior of Alaska and 
on the shores of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. In order to insure 
delivery before those regions are again closed by ice, supplies should 
leave Seattle not later than June 1 of each year. The appropriation 
for the support of the work of the Bureau of Education in Alaska, 
carried in the sundry civil bill, sometimes does not become available 
until late in the summer, with the result that the officials immedi- 
ately responsible for the work of the Bureau of Education in Alaska 
are compelled hastily to send appointees and supplies just before the 
closing of navigation in these northern waters, when severe storms 
are encountered and the rivers are beginning to freeze. Occasionally, 
on account of late shipment, it has been necessary to send supplies to 
their destination hundreds of miles over the frozen country, at heavy 
expense and with great delay. Provision should be made for the 
availability of funds early in each’summer. 
 
-P-A-G-E-694
640 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
5. Protection of walrus, polar bear, deer, reindeer, and caribou.—The 
threatened extermination of walrus in Alaskan waters demands 
attention. During the past three years, owing to the increased 
demand for walrus hide and ivory for commercial purposes, well- 
equipped expeditions in large power boats have killed numbers of 
walrus in northern Bering Sea and in the Arctic Ocean. The meat 
of the walrus is a staple article of food among the Eskimos, and its 
skin is the principal material used in the construction of their indis- 
pensable boats. Since the systematic hunting of walrus has been 
undertaken by white men very few walrus have been obtained by 
the natives, the result being a shortage of food in some of the villages 
along the Arctic coast. I therefore suggest that this subject be 
brought to the attention of the Department of State, with a view to 
ascertaining the feasibility of action to secure a treaty between the 
United States and Russia, and the other powers concerned, for the 
purpose of protecting the walrus in Bering Sea and in the Arctic 
Ocean, 
I recommend that the regulations of the Department of Commerce 
for the protection of fur-bearing animals in Alaska be amended so as 
to establish an open season for the killing of polar bear between 
September 15 and June 15. The strict enforcement of the present 
regulations forbidding the killing of polar bear at any time would work 
a hardship on some of the Alaska Eskimos inhabiting the shores of 
Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean. While most of the polar bear 
taken by these people are killed on the ice from 3 to 10 miles from 
the shore, a few stragglers are unlawfully shot while seeking food on 
the beach, often when robbing the native caches. The possession of 
a few skins taken in this manner should not jeopardize the other skins, 
which are taken legally beyond the 3-mile limit, and cause an Eskimo 
to suffer through the unwarranted activities of game wardens or 
other officials. Polar bears move on and with the floating ice. Their 
habitat is not a fixed one; therefore any regulation which can not 
protect them on the high seas can have littie or no influence in pre- 
venting their extermination. 
In order to protect deer, reindeer, and caribou from the ravages 
of wolves, I recommend that the Alaska game law be amended so as 
to place a bounty of $15 per head on wolves. Protection against the 
ravages of timber wolves is especially needed on the islands of south- 
eastern Alaska, where wolves are rapidly exterminating the deer 
once found there in large numbers. The wolves seem to kill from 
pure love of slaughter; often the carcasses of deer are found un- 
touched save for wounds on the neck and shoulder.

THE REINDEER SERVICE. 
Reports from only a few of the reindeer stations covering the fiscal 
year 1913 have yet been received, the herds being in northern and 
western Alaska. The latest complete statistics regarding the reindeer 
service are those of the fiscal year 1912, according to which the total 
number of reindeer in Alaska June 30, 1912, was 38,476, distributed 
among 54 herds. Of the 38,476 reindeer, 24,068, or 62.5 per cent, 
were owned by 633 natives; 3,776, or 9.8 per cent, were owned by the 
United States; 4,511, or 11.7 per cent, were owned by missions; and 
6,121, or 16 per cent, were owned by Lapps. The total income of the 
natives from the reindeer industry during the fiscal year 1911-12, 
exclusive of the value of the meat and hides used by the natives 
themselves, was $44,885.04. At an average value of $25 per head, 
the 24,068 reindeer owned by the natives represent a capital of 
$601,700. 
GROWTH OF THE ENTERPRISE. 
The reindeer industry in Alaska began in 1892, with the importa- 
tion by the Bureau of Education of 171 reindeer from Siberia. The 
importation continued until 1902, and a total of 1,280 were brought 
from Siberia. The object of the importation was originally to fur- 
nish a source of supply for food and clothing to the Eskimos in the 
vicinity of Bering Strait. At that time the Eskimos on the vast un- 
timbered grazing lands of the Arctic and Bering Sea coastal regions 
from Point Barrow to the Alaska Peninsula were nomadic hunters 
and fishermen, eking out a precarious existence upon the rapidly 
disappearing game animals and fish. In 20 years the reindeer indus- 
try has made of them civilized, thrifty men, having in their herds 
assured support for themselves and opportunity to acquire wealth 
by the sale of meat and skins to the white men in those regions. In 
addition to providing support for the natives, the reindeer furnish an 
assured food supply to the mining and trading settlements in Arctic 
and sub-Arctic Alaska in case of disaster during the long period of 
each year when those regions are icebound and inaccessible. 
ADMINISTRATION. 
The Alaska reindeer service is an integral part of the educational 
system of the Bureau of Education for northern and western Alaska. 
The district superintendents of schools are also the superintendents 
of the reindeer service; the teachers in charge ot the United States 
public schools in the regions affected by the reindeer industry are 
ex officio local superintendents of the reindeer herds in the vicinity 
of their schools. The reindeer service is administered under the 
rules and regulations regarding the United States reindeer service in 
Alaska, approved by the Secretary of the Interior.

DISTRIBUTION. 
The reindeer are distributed among the natives by a system of 
apprenticeship. At each station, promising and ambitious young 
natives are selected by the local superintendents as apprentices for a 
term of four years. In accordance with the rules and regulations, 
an apprentice receives 6, 8, and 10 reindeer at the close of the first, 
second, and third years, respectively, and 10 more at the close of the 
fourth year. Upon the satisfactory termination of his apprentice- 
ship, an apprentice becomes a herder and assumes entire charge of 
his herd, subject to the rules and regulations. A herder must in 
turn employ and similarly distribute reindeer among his apprentices, 
thus becoming an additional factor in the extension of the enterprise. 
A native may also acquire reindeer by purchase from another native, 
upon condition that he will be governed by the provisions of the 
rules and regulations for the reindeer service. 
A NATIVE INDUSTRY. 
In order to make the natives preserve and accumulate the reindeer 
intrusted to them, and to preclude the possibility of the reindeer 
industry being taken from the natives, no native has been permitted 
to sell or otherwise dispose of female reindeer to any person other than 
a native of Alaska. Strict adherence to this fundamental principle 
of the Alaska reindeer service has built up for the natives of northern 
and western Alaska an industry which is especially adapted to them 
and affords them assured means of support. There is grave danger 
that granting to the natives permission to dispose of female reindeer 
to white men would, unless scrupulously safeguarded, rapidly deprive 
the natives of their reindeer and destroy this great native industry 
which is the result of 20 years of careful oversight and fostering care. 
It is possible that the removal of the restriction prohibiting the sale of 
female reindeer to white men might, with watchful guidance, result 
in making reindeer raising in Alaska and the exportation of reindeer 
meat and hides an industry of great commercial importance. 
EXPENDITURES. 
The appropriation for “Reindeer for Alaska’’ for the fiscal year 
ending June 30, 1913, was $5,000, which was expended in furnishing 
food, tents, and clothing to the apprentices (who during the four 
years of their apprenticeship are to a certain extent prevented from 
providing food for themselves by hunting and fishing), and in de- 
traying the expenses of establishing herds in new locations, which 
include hiring guides, also providing food, tents, and camp equipment 
for the native herders employed to transfer the reindeer.

POSSESSIONS. 
ContTENTS.—Hawaii—Philippines—Canal Zone—Samoa—Guam. 
HAWAII. 
Area: 6,449 square miles. Population: 217,744. 
(From the report of Gov. W. F. Frear, for the year 1912-13.) 
The past two years have been of unusual importance in the school 
history of these islands, particularly because of enactments by the 
legislature of 1911 which placed the public schools largely on an auto- 
matic adequate financial basis and provided also for many new build- 
ings. The new financial policy resulted in a large increase in the 
number of teachers and pupils and an increase in the average efficiency 
of the teachers in consequence of the payment of higher salaries. 
During the past year there has been a still larger increase in the 
number of teachers, but, as was to be expected, not so large an in- 
crease in the number of pupils. Thus a much-desired reduction in 
the number of pupils per teacher has begun, this number being 38.03 
now, as compared with 40.81 a year ago. The number contemplated 
ultimately by statute is 35. 
There was expended during the year 1912-13 $677,799.72 for the 
maintenance of public schools, as compared with $630,334.65 during 
1911-12 and $479,351.19 in 1910-11, which was just before the new 
financial policy was instituted. Of the $677,799.72 expended during 
the past year, $634,434.04 was expended by the Territory out of 
current revenues; $18,780.60 for overhead salaries and pay rolls, 
$569,334.05 for teachers’ salaries, and $46,319.39 for other expenses, 
including school supplies, furniture, books for school libraries and for 
sale, equipment and material for industrial training, support of three 
industrial boarding schools, summer school, traveling expenses, etc.; 
and $43,365.68 was expended by the counties for the maintenance of 
school buildings and grounds. Thus the cost of maintenance of the 
public schools was $26.44 per pupil, as compared with $26.53 during 
the preceding year. The corresponding amounts expended during 
the preceding year for overhead charges, teachers’ salaries, and other 
expenses by the Territory and for buildings and grounds by the 
643,
-P-A-G-E-698
  644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
counties were $18,341.78, $497,525.43, $66,367.45, and $47,799.46, 
respectively, showing a substantial increase of $71,808.62 for teachers’ 
salaries alone and a reduction in other expenses during the last year. 
These figures are exclusive of expenditures for the College of Hawaii, 
the cost of school sites, the expenses of schools in various institutions 
under the department of public health, and interest on the investment, 
which is about $2,000,000, in school buildings and grounds. In- 
creased expenditures have been authorized for the ensuing biennial 
period for various items, among which special mention may be made 
of manual and vocational training. . 
The legislature of 1911 provided for new buildings chiefly out of 
loan funds, while that of 1913 provided for them chiefly out of cur- 
rent revenues. For this purpose there was appropriated for the last 
biennial period $371,000 out of loan funds and $6,000 out of current 
revenues and there has been appropriated for the ensuing biennial 
period $261,105 out of current revenues. The amount actually 
expended by the Territory during the past year for new buildings was 
$234,676.79, as compared with $92,577.92 during the preceding year. 
The amount expended by the counties for the same purpose during 
the past year was $34,064.99, as compared with $13,106.71 during the 
preceding year. Thus, the amount expended by both the Territory 
and the counties for new buildings was $268,741.78, which is larger 
than for any preceding year. 
The entire amount expended for the public schools by the Territory 
and by the counties out of both loan funds and current revenues for 
both maintenance and new buildings, exclusive of sites, during the 
past year was $946,541.50, or at the rate of $36.93 per pupil, as com- 
pared with $722,912.57 ($30.43 per pupil) during 1911-12, and 
$483,594.60 ($23.48 per pupil) during 1910-11. 
The number of all schools is 212, an increase of 5 for the year; of 
public schools 161, an increase of 5, as compared with an increase of 1 
for the preceding year; of private schools 51, the same as for the 
preceding year. School accommodations have been increased far 
more by the erection of larger buildings than by an increase in the 
number of buildings. 
The teachers in all schools number 986, an increase of 104 for the 
year; in public schools 674, an increase of 92, as compared with an 
increase of 59 for the preceding year; in private schools 312, an in- 
crease of 12. Of these, 238 are males and 748 are females. They are 
of many races, Americans leading with 472, followed by part-Ha- 
waiians with 203, Hawaiians with 84, Portuguese with 65, British 
with 54, Chinese with 36, Japanese with 29, Germans with 17, and 
smaller numbers, aggregating 26, of other races. 
The pupils in all schools number 32,938, an increase of 3,029 for the 
year; in public schools, 25,631, an increase of 1,879 as compared with
-P-A-G-E-699
  HAWATL 645 
an increase of 3,155 for the preceding year; in private schools, 7,307, 
an increase of 1,150 as compared with an increase of 632 for the pre- 
ceding year. During the two years under the new financial policy the 
number of pupils in the public schools has increased 5,034, or 24.44 
per cent. During the 13 years of Territorial government the number 
of pupils in both public and private schools has increased from 15,537 
to 32,938, or 112 per cent, while those in the public schools alone have 
increased from 11,501 to 25,631, or 123 per cent. Of the pupils in all 
schools, 17,889 are males and 15,049 are females. Those under 6 
years and those over 15 years of age are disproportionately numerous 
in the private schools, while those from 6 to 13 years of age are dis- 
proportionately numerous in the public schools. More and more 
attention is given to laggards and promotions, with a resulting better 
distribution of pupils among the grades. The Japanese continue to 
furnish the largest increase in the pupils of any one race. The pupils 
of this race in all schools increased 1,692 during the year and from 
1,352 to 10,990, or 9,638, during the 13 years of Territorial government, 
while all other pupils combined increased 1,337 during the past year, 
and from 14,185 to 21,948, or 7,763, during the 13 years. During the 
preceding year, however, the increase in Japanese was only 1,691 
as compared with an increase of 2,096 in others. The Japanese lead 
with 10,990, or 33.37 per cent of the total; the Portuguese follow with 
5,497, or 16.69 per cent; then come the Hawaiians with 4,390, or 
13.02 per cent; the part-Hawaiians with 4,146, or 12.59 per cent; 
the Chinese, with 3,783, or 11.48 per cent; and all others with 4,232, 
or 12.85 per cent. 
COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND MECHANIC ARTS. 
The past year has been the first during which the college has been 
in its permanent quarters, which consist of a large concrete building, 
two smaller wooden buildings used as chemical and electrical labora- 
tories, and buildings for the dairy, poultry, and swine experiment 
station, all of which are situated on grounds covering 86.38 acres in 
the suburbs of Honolulu. The college has an astronomical observa- 
tory on a hill about 2 miles away. 
Several members were added to the faculty. Owing to transfers 
of a number of students to colleges on the mainland, the number of 
regular students decreased from 28 to 24. The number of irregular 
students fell from 129 to 122, due probably to the removal of the 
college from near the center of the city into the suburbs. The grad- 
uating class numbered 5—namely, 3 in general science, 1 in agricul- 
ture, and 1 in engineering—as compared with 4 the preceding year, 
when the first class that entered the college graduated. 
Special attention was paid to the work of the agricultural depart- 
ment, including dairying and animal industry. An effort is being
-P-A-G-E-700
  646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
made to develop a high grade of corn peculiarly adapted to Hawaiian 
conditions. The college conducts an extension department, cooper- 
ates with the department of public instruction, and endeavors to keep 
in close touch with the community generally by disseminating useful 
information, assisting in the introduction of better breeds of animals 
and higher grades of agricultural products, and using its equipment 
in testing materials and in other ways. 
LIBRARY OF HAWAII. 
This library was opened last February in a handsome building 
constructed at a cost of $115,514.23, with an additional expenditure 
of $11,630.59 for furniture and fixtures, toward which Mr. Andrew 
Carnegie donated $100,000. Amalgamated with it are the libraries 
of the Honolulu Library and Reading Rooms Association and the 
Hawaiian Historical Society. The former contributed 17,878 vol- 
umes and the latter 1,325 volumes, besides valuable collections of 
Hawaiian pamphlets. The former also contributes about $4,000 
annually for maintenance, and the Territorial legislature provides 
$10,000 annually for the same purpose. During the year 3,431 vol- 
umes were added to the library. The use made of the library has 
been far greater than was anticipated. During the five months 
there were drawn 33,951 volumes. A children’s department is main- 
tained, as well as a general reading room, and traveling libraries are 
sent regularly to 12 stations in different parts of the Territory. 
Provision was made by the last legislature for making the library 
at Hilo, which has just erected a new building at a cost of about 
$20,000, a branch of the Territorial library. 
PUBLIC ARCHIVES. 
These are kept in an absolutely fireproof building specially con- 
structed for the purpose. The work of the librarian and assistants, 
under the direction of a commission, has consisted chiefly in collect- 
ing documents from many sources covering a period of more than a 
century, copying those that are fading, translating those that are in 
the Hawaiian language only, classifying and indexing them, binding 
many of them, and compiling statements on various subjects. Among 
other things, during the last year, the work of copying the privy 
council records of the monarchy was completed and the copies bound 
in 14 volumes. The translation of the journals, of the house of 
representatives for the years 1851-1862 also was completed, so that 
now the entire legislative history of these islands, covering 73 years, 
isin English. Many of the documents contain valuable information 
in regard to land titles. The legislature at its recent session provided 
for the preparation of a new dictionary of the Hawaiian language 
under the direction of the archives commission.

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 647 
THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, 1912-13. 
{From the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Education. By Frank R. White, 
director.] 
GENERAL STATEMENT. 
Excepting in the matter of school enrollment, a very steady and 
encouraging advance has been made during the past year. The 
standard of English instruction has been raised materially. The 
campaign for better school buildings and grounds has been continued 
vigorously and with most successful results. Industrial instruction 
has never been on a sounder basis than at present. The results speak 
for themselves. Further improvement in the American and Fili- 
pino personnel has been very marked. In no line of work has this 
improvement been more notable than in the increase of the effi- 
ciency of the administrative work of the bureau. The general office 
has issued a number of publications of importance; has conducted 
the most successful vacation assembly at Baguio in its history; and 
feels that it is in closer touch than ever before with its teaching 
force, both American and Filipino. Two special campaigns have 
been entered into which will be given detailed mention elsewhere in 
this report. The athletic program is pursued in such a way that a 
large percentage of the boys and girls enrolled in the public schools 
are receiving physical training in one form or another. 
Changed conditions have resulted in constantly increasing de- 
mands upon appropriations, both municipal and insular, of the 
bureau of education, although there has been no corresponding in- 
crease in the total amount of money available. The total amount of 
money, exclusive of that furnished by the city of Manila, but includ- 
ing the municipal share of expenditures for construction, was, in 
1909, $2,673,880; in 1910, $2,816,255; in 1911, $2,751,125; and in 1912, 
$2,741,500. These figures are for the municipal calendar year end- 
ing December 31 combined with the insular fiscal year ending June 
30 of each year. It will be seen that with the ever-increasing de- 
mands on the bureau of education and no corresponding increase in 
appropriations, retrenchment in one of several directions was 
necessary. 
The only logical relief obtainable was either through limiting to 
a considerable extent the amount of primary instruction by closing 
barrio schools, or by reducing the number of intermediate and 
secondary school pupils to the number enrolled during the school 
year 1909-10. The first was chosen for a number of reasons. In 
the first place, the country needed a large number of well-trained 
young men and women as teachers and workers along similar lines.
-P-A-G-E-702
    648 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The schools to date have not been able to produce a sufficient 
number of this class. Moreover, the people who have had a voice 
in affairs have always been much more interested in interme- 
diate and secondary instruction than in the extension of primary 
schools to the barrios. The director of education and his official 
superiors are constantly in receipt of letters protesting against 
the closing or demanding the opening of intermediate schools. 
During the past three years this bureau has received more than 
six times as many communications asking for an extension of in- 
termediate instruction as for an extension of primary instruction. 
Representatives of the insular government traveling through the 
provinces are met with requests from every section for the extension 
of intermediate instruction. Their attention is very rarely indeed 
called to the desirability of extending primary instruction. 
The action taken reduced the number of schools to a dangerously 
low minimum. The situation created was a serious one. However, 
the governor general, by an additional allotment to the bureau of 
education, made possible the opening of 1,000 new primary schools, 
in which it was desired to enroll at least 100,000 additional pupils at 
the opening of the 1913-14 school year. At this writing the approxi- 
mate minimum increase has been secured, notwithstanding the fact 
that reports have not yet been received from a number of school 
divisions on account of normal institute sessions held at the beginning 
of the school year. The increased enrollment secured will greatly 
exceed the minimum figure desired. 
This action provides a remedy for the decreased attendance in the 
public schools, but it does not in any sense relieve the pressure on the 
bureau of education caused by the promotion of large numbers of 
pupils from the lower to the higher grades in those schools which 
have been in operation for some time. This pressure is becoming 
so great that the bureau of education, in default of an increased 
appropriation, will in a short time be again compelled to choose be- 
tween one of two alternatives: To reduce the total number of schools 
or to limit the amount of higher instruction given. 
Although the total enrollment during the 1912-13 school year 
was only 440,050, as compared with 529,665 for the preceding year, 
the attendance increased from 83 to 87 per cent. 
While it is very much to be regretted that public instruction has 
not been extended to every section of the islands, it.is believed that 
the bureau of education has accomplished the maximum possible 
amount of good with the very limited funds at its disposition.
-P-A-G-E-703
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13. 649 
PERSONNEL. 
Divectors.—The directorate of the bureau remains the same as at 
the last report. Mr. Frank R. White, director of education, was 
absent during the greater part of the year. During that time the 
assistant director assumed the responsibilities of the position. 
American teachers.—From the American teaching force there have 
been eliminated those teachers whose services for one reason or an- 
other have been unsatisfactory. This policy has been consistently 
followed for a number of years, as a result of which it would be 
difficult to find a more efficient force than that at present in the 
service of this bureau. 
Only 85 new American teachers were appointed from the United 
States this year. This will result in a slight reduction in the Ameri- 
can teaching force. The teachers secured have been almost without 
exception of splendid character and excellent preparation. This has 
been possible because of the greater interest taken in the service in 
the United States. Only a very few women teachers were employed, 
since they are not available for assignment to any except the larger 
centers of population. 
Filipino teachers.—The total number of Filipino teachers on duty 
at the close of the school year was 7,013, of whom 1,154 received 
salaries from insular funds, 5,759 from municipal funds, and 100 
were apprentice teachers without salary. The statistical tables ac- 
companying the report, when compared with those of previous years, 
show great advancement in their average attainments and ability to 
teach. Applicants are no longer given regular municipal appoint- 
ments unless they have completed at least the intermediate course. 
Of the total number of Filipino teachers, 3,522 have completed the 
intermediate course or better. Filipino teachers are assigned to posi- 
tions of greater responsibility as rapidly as possible. At the present 
time the greatest need is for a number of well-qualified Filipino 
teachers to handle primary and intermediate work. It is through 
such experience that they will become fitted for work of an adminis- 
trative nature. During the past year 115 were assigned to positions 
as supervising or assistant supervising teachers, which figure does 
not include 21 Filipino industrial supervisors. 
OFFICE ORGANIZATION. 
Under the present organization of the office the work is handled 
by six divisions: Accounting, building, property, records, academic, 
and industrial and publications. Increased efficiency is to be reported 
in handling the work of the general office. 
The new academic division is in direct charge of official examina- 
tions, examines sample textbooks, handles details relative to courses
-P-A-G-E-704
    650 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
of study, and makes recommendations from time to time relative to 
instruction along academic lines and other similar subjects. 
The accounting division has handled its work accurately and effi- 
ciently. The books of the office and those of the insular auditor are 
in exact adjustment within 30 days after the close of the fiscal year. 
Salaries and expense accounts have been paid promptly and to the 
satisfaction of the teaching force in general. 
The records division has handled an increased volume of business 
during the past year with the same force of clerks, due to more 
systematic organization of the work of the division. 
The property division has further simplified and perfected the 
work of allotting supplies, textbooks, etc. The stock in the store- 
house has been overhauled and placed in first-class condition. The 
work has at all times been handled promptly and accurately. 
The industrial and publications division has handled in a highly 
satisfactory manner an immense volume of publication work for the 
bureau during the year. It has kept in touch with industrial instruc- 
tion throughout the islands and has contributed much to developing 
and perfecting industrial instruction. 
The buildings division has, as heretofore, had general oversight of 
the construction of buildings and the acquisition of suitable school 
sites. The work has been handled very efficiently. 
The marked general improvement in the efficiency of Filipino 
clerks is worthy of particular notice. They are assigned, as rapidly 
as they develop, to work involving greater responsibility. Filipino 
stenographers in particular are employed in increasing numbers. 
LEGISLATION DURING THE PAST YEAR. 
Act No. 2194 appropriates $26,875 for the improvement of the 
teachers’ camp at Baguio, and $30,000 for school buildings in the 
non-Christian Provinces. 
Act No. 2208 appropriates the sum of $126,850 for the conduct of 
schools in the non-Christian Provinces for the calendar year 1913. 
Act No, 2218 appropriates the sum of $25,000 for the maintenance 
of the school of household industries at Manila. : 
Act No. 2219 appropriates $15,000 for the support of student pen- 
sionados in insular schools. 
Act No. 2262 appropriates $25,000 for the construction of a school- 
house to be known as the José Rizal School Building, to be built in 
the municipality of Calamba, Laguna. 
Act No. 2264 appropriates $137,500 for the construction of build- 
ings for the Philippine school of arts and trades, and $75,000 for aid 
in the construction of central school buildings. 
No general appropriation act was passed by the legislature, and 
as a consequence the bureau of education, as well as other bureaus,
-P-A-G-E-705
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13. 651 
will depend for support on funds allotted by the governor general 
under authority given him by law to allot funds for the support of 
the Government in case of failure of the legislature to pass a general 
appropriation bill. 
In addition to the appropriation acts enumerated above, the fol- 
lowing directly affect the bureau of education: 
Act No. 2198 authorizes the secretary of public instruction to make 
an allotment from the funds appropriated under the Gabaldon Act 
for the construction of a school on land belonging to the Government 
of the United States in the naval reservation at Olongapo, Zambales. 
Act No. 2217 authorizes municipal councils to appropriate at the 
beginning of each year a certain part of school funds for the creation 
and maintenance of night schools in English. 
Act No. 2249 gives to the governor general, on behalf of the Phil- 
ippine Islands, and to municipalities and Provinces, the right to ex- 
propriate real property for public uses. This act confers on courts 
of first instance exclusive original jurisdiction in such cases. 
Among the large number of acts passed during the year the fol- 
lowing do not affect the bureau of education directly, but are of in- 
direct interest to it: 
Act No. 2225, appropriating the sum of $50,000 for the Philippine 
exposition to be held in the city of Manila during the year 1914. 
Such an exposition is authorized under the provisions of Act No. 
2224, 
Act No. 2226, appropriating the sum of $75,000 for the establish- 
ment and maintenance of stations for practical instruction in matters 
concerning agriculture and for a system of agricultural demonstra- 
tion and development. 
Act No. 2231, authorizing municipal councils under certain condi- 
tions to close municipal roads, streets, alleys, parks, or squares for 
governmental purposes. 
Act No, 2238, providing for the revision and correction of land-tax 
assessments. 
Act No. 2239, providing that until January 1, 1920, both English 
and Spanish under certain conditions shall be official languages. 
Act No. 2253, appropriating the sum of $22,500 to provide for the 
creation of 20 scholarships in the Government forest school at Los 
Banos, for the maintenance of 33 scholarships already created, and 
for the salaries, traveling expenses, and equipment of graduates of 
the school. 
Act No. 2259, providing for a cadastral survey, is one of the most 
important pieces of legislation of recent years. 
Act No. 2260, appropriating the sum of $312,500 for the university 
of the Philippines for the fiscal year 1914.  
-P-A-G-E-706
  652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
A little more than a year ago committees were appointed to con- 
sider changes in the primary and intermediate courses of study. 
Their reports have been received and accepted by the director of 
education with very few changes. It has been found in the past that 
the work of most of the grades was greatly overcrowded. The 
changes made have been in the direction of simplification. 
Conditions in this country demand early specialization. In the pre- 
scribed courses of study this specialization is introduced in the first 
year of the intermediate courses. Six courses are provided: The 
general course; the course for teaching; the course in farming; the 
trade course; the course in housekeeping and household arts; and the 
course in business. To delay specialization until the secondary course 
is reached would result in sending from the public schools the vast 
majority of the pupils without any special preparation to fit them for 
useful careers in the more or less humble stations in life to which the 
activities of the great majority of this or any other country must be 
confined. 
A recent survey of the field discloses the fact that many inter- 
mediate schools offering the special courses have not been properly 
equipped with sites, buildings, and industrial equipment to give these 
courses effectively. During the past few months a thorough exami- 
nation has been made into the organization of these schools with a 
view to ultimately closing them in case it is.not possible to raise them 
to the standards set by this bureau. 
It is planned to establish at least one school offering the course in 
farming in each division. Schools of this type must have at least 
10 hectares of good land. Such schools are now in operation at 
Ballesteros, Cagayan; Batac, Ilocos Norte; Indang, Cavite; Taclo- 
ban, Leyte; Batangas, Batangas; and Iba, Zambales. In addition 
to these, the Central Luzon Agricultural School at Munoz, Nueva 
Ecija, offers more extensive instruction in agriculture. 
There are 259 intermediate schools offering the general course, 96 
the housekeeping and household arts course, 49 the teaching course, 
40 the trade course, 6 the farming course, and 2 the course in business.

BUILDINGS AND SITES, 
The building program of the bureau of education may be sum- 
marized as follows: 
Each barrio school must be provided with a site containing at least 
5,000 square meters before the expenditure of insular funds for con- 
struction purposes will be authorized. For central schools the mini- 
mum is fixed at 10,000 square meters. Division superintendents are 
urged to require standard sites, even though there may be no very 
immediate prospect. of erecting permanent school buildings thereon. 
Up to a maximum of $2,500, insular funds will be made available for 
the aid of municipalities in schoolhouse construction, on condition 
that they give half as much as the Insular Government. 
Where permanent buildings can not be erected, school authorities 
are urged to erect satisfactory temporary buildings in accordance 
 
-P-A-G-E-708
  654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
with plans prepared by the general office. In all cases certain mini- 
mum requirements are laid down for temporary buildings to be occu- 
pied by public schools. The fixing of these requirements two years 
ago has greatly improved general school conditions throughout the 
islands. 
Experience has shown that it is better policy to concentrate ex- 
penditures on the construction of larger central school buildings than 
on a number of one or two room barrio buildings, housing only a 
limited number of pupils, but costing more per classroom. 
There are now in the islands 1,032 standard school sites, of which 
643 are of 5,000 to 10,000 square meters in size, and 389 are 10,000 
square meters or more in extent. Of this total number, 311 barrio 
school sites and 252 central school sites were secured during the past 
fiscal year. During the previous fiscal year 203 standard barrio school 
sites and 41 central school sites were secured. These figures show that 
in the past two years 78.2 per cent of the total number of standard 
school sites have been secured as a result of the activities of division 
superintendents, supervising teachers, and municipal officials. 
During the past year 111 standard-plan schoolhouses have been 
completed, containing 435 classrooms and providing ample accommo- 
dations for approximately 21,750 pupils. This brings the total num- 
ber of standard-plan school buildings constructed since the passage of 
the original Gabaldon Act up to 180, containing 665 classrooms. 
The governmental agencies responsible for construction work are 
better organized and equipped than ever before. The bureau of 
public works is to be commended for greatly increased efficiency in 
handling a very difficult situation. The policy of using competent 
Filipinos for the supervision of schoolhouse construction has been 
inaugurated during the past year, and has considerably lowered the 
cost of building work. The bureau of supply has on hand a large 
supply of dimension lumber and other materials sufficient to fill 
promptly requisitions for building materials. This has also mate- 
rially reduced the cost of construction. In the past, when materials 
were not delivered promptly, construction gangs have been left with- 
out work, thus increasing the cost of buildings. 
At the time of writing this report work is progressing rapidly on 
the new building for the girls’ dormitory of the Philippine Normal 
School. Funds have been made available for the necessary building 
for the Philippine School of Arts and Trades on a site adjacent to 
that of the Philippine Normal School. 
INSULAR SCHOOLS, 
Under the head of insular schools are included those which depend 
entirely upon the Insular Government for support. It should be. 
remembered in this connection that all other schools are either pro-
-P-A-G-E-709
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13. 655 
vincial or municipal in character, although they may receive aid 
from the Insular Government. 
The Philippine Normal School, the Philippine School of Arts and 
Trades, the School of Household Industries, the Philippine School of 
Commerce, and the School for Deaf and Blind are insular schools. 
In addition to these is a girls’ dormitory, supported directly by the 
bureau of education. The Insular Government also bears the entire 
expense of supporting insular student and teacher pensionados in the 
Philippine Normal School, the Philippine School of Arts and Trades, 
and in the college of agriculture of the University of the Philippines. 
The Philippine Normal Schoot——The course of study of the Philip- 
pine Normal School provides for instruction in the subject matter 
of the public-school curriculum and, in addition, offers such profes- 
sional training as will best fit those in attendance for service as 
teachers. The academic departments embrace four years’ work after 
the completion of the intermediate course. Particular attention is 
given to the teaching of English in all of the four years of the course. 
The industrial department gives instruction in lacemaking, house- 
keeping and household arts, embroidery, Irish crocheting, hat weay- 
ing, matting, macrame, textile weaving, and bamboo furniture. Two 
years’ work in this department is required of every candidate for 
graduation. The course in housekeeping and household arts pre- 
pares young women for teaching domestic science in primary and 
intermediate schools. The boys are required to take a course in 
school and home gardening, which includes a limited amount of 
actual work in the normal-school garden. 
All candidates for graduation are required to teach one class a 
day for two years. This teaching embraces all subjects of the pri- 
mary and intermediate grades; 120 student teachers are in charge of 
training classes each day, their work being directed by 10 critic 
teachers. Of those who graduated from the normal school during 
the last three years, 97 per cent have entered the teaching service. 
So far not one has abandoned his profession. A few have obtained 
leave of absence in order to continue their studies in the University 
of the Philippines. 
In June, 1913, the school opened with a total enrollment of 1,400, 
of whom 690 were enrolled in the regular normal-school work, leay- 
ing an attendance of 770 in the training department. The present 
faculty consists of 24 American and 22 Filipino teachers. 
This school now occupies a new concrete building on Taft Avenue, 
the total cost of which was $224,500. Considerable work has been 
done in improving the school grounds and in laying out baseball and 
other athletic fields. Work has been begun on the new girls’ dormi- 
tory adjacent to the normal school buildings. This will cost $147,500. 
 
-P-A-G-E-710
  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The Philippine School of Arts and Trades.—\t has been necessary 
during the past year to turn away a number of applicants for admis- 
sion, on account of a lack of adequate facilities for handling all can- 
didates. The sum of $237,500 is available for the construction of 
buildings for this school, the completion of which will permit of the 
handling of a larger number of students and of the establishment of 
new courses without adding materially to the expense of conducting 
the school. The total number of pupils enrolled during the 1912-18 
school year was 601, an increase of 47 over the preceding year. A 
school library containing 1,016 volumes has been established during 
the year. A school restaurant, costing the Government nothing for 
maintenance, has been in successful operation. Wholesome foods 
were sold at cost. Although no effort has been made to increase the 
amount of commercial work, the figures for the 1912-13 school year 
show an increase of $6,478.12 over those for the preceding year, the 
total for the year being $23,045.34. 
Thirty-four students graduated from the school during the school 
year 1911-12. Of these, 33 are engaged in work directly or in- 
directly connected with the courses they pursued in the school, while 
1 is taking higher work in another school. In adition to the gradu- 
ates, 35 nongraduates secured positions. 
On request of the Shipowners’ Association, it was decided to estab- 
lish a nautical department in connection with this school. This de- 
partment was opened at the beginning of the school year in 1913, 
the enrollment being limited to 40 pupils. Applicants must be over 
18 years of age; have completed at least the intermediate course of 
study; and signify their intention to follow seamanship as a pro- 
fession after graduation. Instructors for the academic work in this 
department were chosen from the faculty of the school. Two experi- 
enced officers have been assigned by the director of navigation to 
part-time work, teaching practical seamanship and navigation in the 
school. The first two years of the course are to be spent at the school, 
with the exception of the first long vacation, which is to be spent on 
board inter-island vessels. At the close of the second year, the pupils 
will be distributed among the various inter-island vessels for 18 
months’ practical instruction on board ship, during which period 
they will receive an allowance of $7.50 per month, in addition to food 
and quarters. The Shipowners’ Association has signed an agreement 
to use its best efforts to give permanent employment at suitable re- 
muneration to pupils completing the course of study and the pre- 
seribed apprenticeship on board vessels. 
The Philippine School of Commerce.—The enrollment in the Phil- 
ippine School of Commerce shows a continuous upward trend in the 
number of well-trained pupils matriculating. Out of a total enroll- 
ment of 392, there were 31 high-school graduates and 321 possessing 
 
-P-A-G-E-711
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13, 657 
certain secondary credits. In order to make room for the increasing 
number of advanced pupils, seventh-grade classes were discontinued 
at the end of March, 1913. 
Pupils were enrolled from 32 Provinces. Reports indicate that 123 
pupils were enrolled in the bookkeeping course, 24 in the four-year 
course in commerce, 40 in the intermediate business course, 174 in the 
two-year stenography course, and 31 in the one-year stenography 
course. 
The School for Deaf and Blind—The School for Deaf and Blind, 
as well as the Philippine School of Commerce, is for administrative 
purposes placed under the direction of the superintendent of the 
Manila city schools. The work is handled by an American principal 
and four Filipino assistants. The total enrollment during the past 
school year was 46, collected from the city of Manila and the various 
Provinces. 
The School of Houschold Industries —At the time of writing this 
report the School of Household Industries has completed the first 
year of its existence. The purpose of this school is to train adult 
women in certain selected home industries, particularly embroidery 
and lacemaking. At the time of matriculation candidates must agree 
to return to their home towns after graduation to establish local 
classes for instruction, with the idea of employing such students as 
assistants at fair wages when they have become sufficiently skilled. 
Very superior work has been done by this school, and it has attracted 
general favorable attention from authorities familiar with these lines 
of work. 
PENSIONADOS IN INSULAR SCHOOLS. 
When public schools were first opened in the Philippines after the 
American occupation it was found that there were very few Filipino 
teachers properly qualified to do the work required of them. The 
educational standard required of teachers was: raised as rapidly as 
conditions would permit. It soon became apparent, however, that 
unless some extraordinary measures were taken the teaching force 
could not be improved as rapidly as desired. As a result, scholarships 
were provided by law for students and teachers who would agree to 
return to their respective Provinces and engage in teaching for a 
period equal to that during which they enjoyed such scholarships. 
These pensionados receive traveling expenses to and from Manila 
and an allowance sufficient to meet their living expenses while actu- 
ally in school. ; . 
The number of pensionados of both classes is approximately 240. 
They are assigned to the Philippine Normal School, the Philippine 
School of Arts and Trades, and to the College of Agriculture at Los 
17726°—xp 1913—vor 1—42 
 
-P-A-G-E-712
  658 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Banos. Teacher pensionados ordinarily are permitted to remain for 
only a single year. Student pensionados may ordinarily remain for 
a two-year period. The improvement in the teaching force as a result 
of this system has been so marked that it is recommended for con- 
tinuance. ; 
SCHOOLS FOR NONCHRISTIANS. 
The legislative function for the Provinces of Nueva Viscaya, 
Agusan, and the Mountain Province is performed by the Philippine 
Commission. The presence of a large number of non-Christians in 
them makes necessary the establishment of a special form of govern- 
ment and gives rise to the name “non-Christian Provinces.” The 
bureau of education must therefore look to the Philippine Commis- 
sion for the funds to carry on educational work in these Provinces. 
Only a few of the towns and settlements have municipal school funds, 
so that practically all of the money for the support of the schools 
must come from the Insular government. Substantial progress has 
been made in all of these divisions. 
ATHLETICS. 
Progress in the development of athletics and physical training 
during the past year has been very great. Particular attention has 
been given to the further development of group games and other 
forms of play in which the great majority of the pupils can advan- 
tageously participate. The percentage of pupils participating in 
atheletics is very high, although no accurate figures are yet available. 
This has been accomplished without detracting in the slightest from 
the attention given to the specialized form of athletics. Practically 
every interscholastic record was broken at the last interscholastic meet 
held in connection with the Philippine Carnival. In baseball, basket 
ball, and similar sports the progress has been just as notable. 
During the past year two separate contests were held to determine 
the award of certain prizes donated by Gov. Gen. W. Cameron Forbes. 
A basket-ball outfit was given to the school in each division contain- 
ing the highest percentage of pupils qualifying in a three-event 
athletic competition. Although this was a new contest in most divi- 
sions, the interest and rivalry were very keen. A volley-ball outfit 
was awarded to the school in each division winning the championship 
in group athletic contests. This contest also aroused much interest 
and secured very beneficial results. 
In connection with the Philippine Carnival, held in Manila Feb- 
ruary 1 to 9, inclusive, a Far-Eastern Olympiad was held, in which 
China, Japan, and the Philippines took part. The organization of 
the Far-Eastern Olympiad was due to the initiative of the Philippine 
amateur athletic federation, with which the bureau of education is 
 
-P-A-G-E-713
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13. 659 
affiliated. The majority of the contestants representing the Philip- 
pines were school boys. In track, field, and general athletic events the 
Philippines were victorious. Japan won the baseball championship. 
It is difficult to overestimate the significance of this series of games. 
It may be truthfully said that athletics in the public schools made 
such an international contest possible. 
The very marked improvement noticeable in the spirit of sports- 
manship of both teachers and pupils is very pleasing. Only one or 
two instances have been reported during the year of teachers who 
failed to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner at athletic 
contests. It is the intention of this office to terminate the connection 
of any teacher with athletic management who is guilty of rude and 
unsportsmanlike deportment at any athletic meet. 
THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT. 
By fixing the standard size of barrio schoolhouse sites at 5,000 
square meters, and that for central schools at 10,000 square meters, 
provision is made for an ample playground in connection with each 
school. The extent of the playground movement in the Philippines 
is indicated by the number of standard school sites required. On 
April 1, 1913, there were 1,032 standard school sites, of which 244 
were secured during the school year 1911-12 and 563 during the school 
year 1912-13. 
In the bureau of education there are 39 schools that are provincial 
in character, 36 of which are provincial high schools. These schools 
are practically all located on sites large enough to furnish ample 
playgrounds. A baseball field, a quarter-mile running track, and 
courts for: group games are found in connection with the majority of 
these schools. Twenty-eight of them are supplied with baseball 
grounds belonging to the school plant; 21 have running tracks; 12 
have inclosed athletic fields; and 8 are supplied with grand stands. 
TEACHERS’ VACATION ASSEMBLY AT BAGUIO. 
Teachers’ Camp, located at Baguio, offers to American and Filipino 
teachers an opportunity to spend the long vacation during the heated 
period in most congenial surroundings, where opportunities are given 
for participation in conferences, in athletics and other amusements, 
and in social intercourse with their fellows. 
The past year was the best in the history of this institution. 
During the season the total number of visitors, exclusive of children, 
reached 437, as compared with 395 during the previous year. The 
number of Filipino teachers in attendance was much larger than 
heretofore, the total being 89. It is hoped that this number will be 
materially increased next year. It is the aim of the bureau to secure  
-P-A-G-E-714
    660 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the attendance of the best qualified Filipino teachers, who will be 
able to take advantage of the opportunities offered by lectures and 
special courses. 
During the vacation assembly of this year the teachers present 
benefited greatly by the presence of two noted educators from the 
United States—Dr. Paul Monroe, head of the department of educa- 
tion, Columbia University, and Dr. Edwin A. Schell, president of 
the Iowa Wesleyan University. Dr. Monroe arrived in the islands 
the latter part of the month of February and spent the interval 
between that time and the closing of schools during the last week of 
March in the most thorough possible investigation of the school sys- 
tem. He participated at Baguio in conferences with the directors, 
division superintendents, and teachers on educational conditions in 
the islands, and delivered a number of lectures during the earlier 
part of the assembly. His comments and criticisms on conditions 
from the standpoint of an educational specialist were of great value. 
Dr. Schell’s lectures were delivered during the latter part of the 
assembly, on literary and ethical subjects of great interest and educa- 
tional value to the teachers in attendance. The large and enthusi- 
astic attendance at all these lectures was in itself sufficient proof of 
the high appreciation in which they were held by the residents of 
the camp. 
Undoubtedly the most important feature of the vacation assembly 
is the conferences, presided over by the director of education, at 
which American and Filipino teachers are given an opportunity to 
express themselves on matters concerning the work of the bureau of 
education, and more definitely to inform themselves of the policy 
of the director of education. 
VACATION ASSEMBLIES AT OTHER POINTS. 
The vacation assembly for Filipino teachers was held at the Philip- 
pine Normal School from April 15 to May 24, 1913. Thirty-six 
school divisions sent a total enrollment of 1,109 students. Classes 
were held at the same time in the Philippine School of Arts and 
Trades, and were attended by 198 students from 31 school divisions. 
The work done in these assemblies was of a high order. However, 
it is believed that in the future the attendance should be limited to 
the most advanced teachers, who could be given courses in school 
administration and management, tending to fit them for positions 
as principals of central and intermediate schools, and as supervising 
and assistant supervising teachers. 
Normal institutes or vacation assemblies were held for the instruc- 
tion of teachers in every school division, except in those school divi- 
sions near Manila, the teachers of which may easily attend the
-P-A-G-E-715
  
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13, 661 
vacation assembly at the insular schools in Manila. Twenty-four 
divisions held vacation assemblies during the long vacation, or 
normal institutes immediately after the beginning of school. 
SPECIAL FEATURES, SCHOOL YEAR 1912-13. 
The corn campaign—tThe corn campaign conducted by the bureau 
of education was the most important of the special features of the 
work of the past school year. Two contests were arranged, one for 
the production of the best ears of corn, and the other for the produc- 
tion of the most corn on a given area. In addition to this, demon- 
strations were given in practically all of the municipalities of the 
islands in the use of corn as a human food. This campaign received 
the enthusiastic support of the people and officials alike, and has 
resulted in an immense amount of good in disseminating knowledge 
of the most advanced methods of corn production, and the use of 
corn as human food.’ The final exhibit was held in Manila during 
the 1913 carnival, and consisted of a display of corn from practi- 
cally all Provinces, and daily demonstrations in the preparation and 
serving of corn foods. 
One of the main purposes of this campaign was to impress upon 
the Filipino the fact that corn is a food for human consumption. It 
was also hoped that the campaign would result in increasing the 
cultivation of corn. The campaign will be continued for the present 
school year with the additional feature of teaching the pupil to cul- 
tivate his plat of ground the entire year, either with corn alone or 
by the addition of legumes, 
Some idea of the extent of this campaign can be gained from the 
fact that 30,327 boys were enrolled in the contests; 6,660 girls were 
taught corn recipes; 235 demonstrations were held; and 247,048 
people were served. Approximately one-half million people attended - 
the demonstrations. The recipes used call for the use of utensils 
and ingredients found in the average Filipino home. 
Arbor Day.—Reports show that during the past year 330,795 trees 
or shrubs were planted by the children of the public schools, 208,746 
of which were reported to be alive and in good condition at the end 
of the year. In the past the percentage of trees surviving has been 
low, due largely to the fact that they were not adequately protected 
by fences. The attention given by the bureau to the proper fencing 
of school sites will do much to remedy this condition of affairs. 
Civico-educational lectures.—Although considerable good has been 
accomplished, the results secured by giving civico-educational lec- 
tures in compliance with Act No. 1829 have never been entirely satis- 
factory. The reports for the past year indicate that approximately 
522,474 people attended the lectures. They were given in the native 
 
-P-A-G-E-716
662 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
dialects, and on the following subjects: Rights and duties of citizens; 
housing of public schools; the prevention of disease; diseases of ani- 
mals; rice culture; coconuts; coconut beetles; and corn. 
Collection of Local Geographic Material—In order to furnish 
teachers in the public schools information of value in teaching local 
geography, all division superintendents were requested to prepare 
certain geographical notes covering their respective provinces. This 
work is nearing completion and when finished will constitute a 
valuable body of information which it is hoped will be productive 
of very material improvement in local geography instruction. 
INDUSTRIAL INSTRUCTION. 
The program of industrial instruction for the public schools has 
been carefully worked out and includes most of the important Philip- 
pine industrial activities. It covers seven years of work—the four 
years of the primary course and the three years of the intermediate 
courses—and provides instruction in agriculture, domestic science, 
needlework in its various forms, weaving. of Philippine fibers, and 
work in wood, iron, and clay. No pupil passes through the primary 
and intermediate piudes without some industrial instruction. In gen- 
eral it may be said that the industrial work of the two lower primary 
grades consists of weaving for both boys and girls, sewing for the 
girls, and gardening for the larger boys. Work along similar lines 
is further developed in the last two years’ work of the primary 
grades. 
Specialization is begun at once in the intermediate grades. Six 
courses are provided: The general course, the course for teaching, the 
course in farming, the trade course, the course in housekeeping and 
household arts, and the course in business. The general course, 
* although it is more purely academic than the others, provides for 
industrial work in every grade. 
Under the direction of the division superintendents of schools, 736 
teachers give their entire time to industrial work. Of these, 32 are 
division industrial supervisors and assistants, 115 are domestic- 
science teachers, 101 are trade school and shop teachers, and the 
remainder are instructors in the various lines of handicraft. In 
addition, several hundred other teachers give part of their time and 
attention to industrial instruction. As a result of this organization, 
every school in the Philippines, except the 37 schools offering secon- 
dary instruction, gives industrial work in one form or another. The 
results secured by the consistent following of the industrial program 
during the past three years are most satisfactory. The quality of the 
work is improving very rapidly. The following figures give some 
idea of the extent of this instruction:
-P-A-G-E-717
  EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13, 663 
For the school year 1911-12, 91 per cent of the February monthly 
enrollment of pupils were doing some form of industrial work. 
During the past year stricter compliance with the requirements has 
brought this percentage up to 93. A portion of the 7 per cent not 
engaged in industrial work is found in the secondary grades. The 
remainder represents the lowest grades for which work has not yet 
been provided. This means that practically every pupil in the 
primary and intermediate grades is learning under intelligent direc- 
tion to do something with his hands. 
An examination of the statistical tables of this report will show 
that 19,958 boys were taking the trade and shop work; that 100,648 
boys were engaged in gardening and farming; that 12,969 girls were 
taking the gardening work; and that 83,193 girls were studying 
housekeeping and household arts. Among other crafts and indus- 
tries, 12,998 girls were learning lacemaking, 12,625 embroidery, 6,600 
cooking, 10,456 boys and 3,031 girls were making hats, 29,527 pupils 
were studying matmaking, and 73,835 were working on baskets. 
Of particular interest is the showing made in the extension of gar- 
dening from the schools to the homes of the people. Three years ago, 
with the exception of one or two provinces where this work had its 
first start, home gardens were practically unknown. For the school 
year 1911-12, 22,958 home gardens were reported, about two and one- 
half times the number reported for the preceding year. The 1912-13 
school year shows a further increase of 50 per cent over the above 
number, or 35,719 gardens cultivated by pupils themselves at their 
own homes, and modeled closely after the plats which they worked in 
the school gardens. There were 2,310 school gardens during the past 
school year, practically the same number as for the preceding year. 
Without question, the garden feature of the school program is 
largely responsible for the marked improvement in the quality and 
quantity of fresh vegetables now available in the public markets all 
over the islands. This work logically leads up to the course in farm- 
ing, which this bureau is endeavoring to establish in at least one farm 
school of approved size (10 hectares) in each province. 
The number of provincial trade schools has been increased from 
5 in March, 1909, to 18 in June, 1913. In addition to these standard 
trade schools, in which 1,211 pupils were enrolled, there were 121 
intermediate school shops, in which 832 pupils took the regular trade 
course, and 2,620 other pupils received some instruction in woodwork- 
ing during the school year 1912-13. Twenty-three of these shops are 
equipped with woodworking machinery. As soon as a pupil has 
attained a certain degree of skill, he is permitted to do commercial 
work and to receive pay for it. Work of this character to the value 
of $87,841.57 was produced in these schools during the year, approxi- 
mately $17,568.31 of which was received by the pupils as compensa-
-P-A-G-E-718
664 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
tion for their labor. In addition to these figures, the primary shops 
turned out commercial work to the value of $15,185.47. 
The eighth annual exhibition of the industrial work of the public 
schools was held in connection with the Philippine carnival in 
Manila from February 1 to 9, 1913. About 23,305 units of work, 
worth $28,591.62, were displayed, as compared with 16,362 units, worth 
$17,209.34, for the preceding year. Of this exhibit, $20,056.76 worth 
was sold, as compared with $12,888.54 sold the preceding year. This 
exhibit not only gave to the thousands of people who saw it an idea 
of the industrial work done by the public schools, but also gave to 
many Filipinos their first definite idea of the industrial and agricul- 
tural possibilities of their country. The profits of this work, a large 
part of which went to the pupils themselves, will further serve the 
purpose of showing them where they may direct their energies most 
profitably. 
Statistics furnished this office by the insular collector of customs 
show that during the fiscal year 1911 embroideries to the value of 
$99,866 were exported from the Philippines. This was increased to 
$127,500 in 1912 and to $195,455 during the fiscal year 1913. It is 
believed that the instruction given by the bureau of education has 
contributed to this noteworthy increase. 
During the year two lines of investigation worthy of special men- 
tion have been carried on. Much work has been done in the selection 
of typical Philippine designs, which will be applied to articles pro- 
duced from materials grown in the Philippines. Foreign designs 
will be followed for the most part in needlework, with the possible 
exception of that in pifia and jusi. A large body of information 
has been collected from various sources relative to opportunities in 
various industries, which will be used by the bureau in advising 
pupils of the lines of work they might profitably pursue during and 
after their school courses. The work accomplished here follows in a 
general way that of those giving attention to vocational guidance in 
the large cities of the United States. 
The bureau of education each year is developing a large number 
of boys and girls who are sufficiently skilled to make articles having 
a commercial value. It will not be possible, however, for them to 
reap the fullest advantages of their skill and labor until there is a 
more thorough industrial sales organization than at present. It is 
imperative that all workers find a ready sale for their products. 
Cash payments are essential. The articles must be bought where 
produced. The bureau of education has given all possible attention 
to this question. Its final solution, however, is the logical duty of 
other governmental agencies and of commercial firms. The bureau 
of education can not follow up all pupils who have become skilled as 
industrial workers, either to advise them of prevailing market de- 
   
-P-A-G-E-719
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 1912-13. 665 
mands and prices, or to assure them of ready cash sales for all 
marketable articles produced. As soon as the industrial sales or- 
ganization has been extended to all sections of the islands, so that 
workers may be assured of reliable cash markets, the country will 
begin to realize fully on the industrial instruction given. There will 
be tremendous activity along industrial lines as soon as sales facilities 
adapted to the necessities of the people have been generally provided. 
The corn campaign, which is given detailed mention under the 
heading “ Special features, school year 1912-13,” is a part of the 
general scheme for industrial education. The Philippine Craftsman 
is also a product of the industrial activities of this bureau.

CANAL ZONE. 
When the United States Government in 1904 secured sovereignty 
over the strip of land on the Isthmus of Panama now known as the 
Canal Zone, the local government established by the Americans 
faced a problem which was undoubtedly unique in educational 
annals. : 
Previous to the American occupation of the Canal Zone territory 
no effort had been made to organize a system of schools in the inte- 
rior towns of the Isthmus. The children had grown up in ignorance, 
except for the little instruction a few of them picked up at home. 
The laborers imported by the French Canal Company did open a few
-P-A-G-E-721
CANAL ZONE, 667 
schools, taught by Jamaican colored men, but the equipment was so 
meager, the housing facilities so inadequate, and the teaching force 
so incompetent that this move can be considered as but a very 
small step toward the growth of a school system. 
With the advent of the Americans, however, a new impetus was 
given to education in the Canal Zone. The organization of a canal 
working force brought a large number of Americans and even more 
colored West Indian laborers to the Isthmus who demanded provi- 
sion for the education of their children. This demand was not 
easily met in the first stages of the American occupation of the Canal 
Zone. The difficulties experienced in endeavoring properly to care 
for the growing working force so completely absorbed the attention 
and energy of the authorities that no satisfactory progress was made 
toward the establishment of an efficient school system. Then, too, 
because of the lack of housing accommodations and the beliefs 
prevalent in the United States as to the unhealthful conditions on 
the Isthmus, it was almost impossible to procure women teachers. 
To retain men teachers was out of the question; once on the Zone, 
men could obtain employment at work yielding practically double 
the remuneration offered for teaching. Long delays occurred before 
proper equipment and textbooks could be secured. So that the 
school system of the Canal Zone, which was authorized to be estab- 
lished in 1904, opened its first free public schools under the authority 
of the Canal Zone Government on January 2, 1906, and did not, in 
fact, become established on a sound basis with proper equipmont 
and a good teaching force until 1908. The schools started in 1906 
with 18 schools and an enrollment of 840 pupils; in 1907 there were 
30 schools, with an enrollment of 1,741, and in 1908 there were 25 
schools, with an enrollment of 2,867 pupils. Of these 25 schools, 11 
were for white and 14 for colored children. 
The largest problem, after the school system had once been estab- 
lished, was in the organization of a course of study, the supervision 
of instruction, and the grading of pupils—questions which in the life 
of a school system like that on the Canal Zone necessarily come later 
than the erection of buildings and the provision of teachers and sup- 
plies. The system of instruction, which at first was essentially of an 
individual character, was soon changed to class instruction. In 
similar grades in the schools throughout the Zone, uniform instruc- 
tion in all subjects was provided. This was necessary; not only on 
account of the increase in enrollment, but chiefly because of the great 
amount of enforced moving from one part of the Canal Zone to 
another. Employees on the canal work were shifted continually 
from point to point, resulting in a constant transfer of pupils. In- 
deed, it often happened that a pupil, during a single school year, 
attended three and sometimes four different schools.
-P-A-G-E-722
        668 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
In order to keep informed of the pupils who passed from one 
school to another during a term, and in order to look after their best 
interests upon their entrance to the new school, a system of tripli- 
cate transfer slips was adopted. Teachers were thus advised when a 
pupil might be expected to enter another school and were informed 
of his aptitudes and weaknesses in the studies. In order at all times 
to keep these pupils properly graded, individual instruction was 
provided, for which two teachers devoted the major portion of their 
time. These teachers also gave individual instruction to other pupils 
who were somewhat behind in their work or who gave promise of 
being able with assistance to go into an advanced grade. The num- 
ber of cases where children needed personal attention has continued 
to increase until at present individual instruction has become an 
integral part of the school system in the zone. 
The rapid grading of pupils was made particularly difficult by the 
great difference in the previous preparation of the pupils attending 
the zone schools. To illustrate this, it may be well to give a state- 
mont of the school systems which contributed to the instruction of 
pupils before they entered the zone schools. The following classifi- 
cation was made up from statistics obtained in March, 1909: 
States and countries in which the Canal Zone children had received instruction.

The work of public instruction was gradually developed ‘and sys- 
tematized until at present, despite the problems—new in educational 
activities—which had, to be overcome, the school system in opera- 
tion in the Canal Zone may be considered an efficient one. The 
course of study for both the white and colored grade schools embraces 
the following subjects: Arithmetic, calisthenics, drawing, English, 
geography, history, music, language, reading, writing. 
A secondary or high-school course is also provided for white 
children. This advanced course includes four years of Latin, three of 
French, and three of German, 54 weeks in mathematics, three years of 
science, three of history, four of English, and two years of Spanish. 
From this four-year course two pupils were graduated in 1911, five in 
1912, and seven in June, 1913. 
An experiment in the operation of gardens was inaugurated in 1908 
in connection with some of the schools for colored children. These 
gardens, devoted to both decorative plants and vegetables, and con- 
ducted in small plots of land adjoining the schools, are cared for 
entirely by the pupils under the guidance of a horticulturist. 
Free textbooks and stationery are provided at all schools and free 
medical treatment of the pupils is furnished by the Government. In 
addition, where children live at distant points they are transported 
to and from school by wagon and railroad without cost to the parents. 
The following table indicates the extent of school work in the 
Canal Zone since the schools were installed:

1 Figures for 1912 and 1911 show actual enrollment; those for previous years, gross enrollment without 
deductions for pupils who enrolled in a number of schools during the term. 
In June, 1913, there were 16 schools for white children, with a net 
enrollment of 1,369, and 15 schools for colored children, with a net 
enrollment of 1,580 pupils. 
The supervisory and teaching force consists at present of a super- 
intendent, a supervisor of upper grades and colored schools, a super- 
visor of primary grades, a principal of high schools, and 47 teachers for 
white schools and 32 teachers for colored schools. With the excep- 
tion of the superintendent, the supervisor of upper grades and 
colored schools, and the principal of the high school, the teaching 
force for white schools is composed entirely of white American women. 
These, in nearly all cases, have completed a certified high-school 
course with two years of normal or college training, and have had at 
least two years’ successful experience before coming to the zone. 
The schools for colored children are taught by colored men from 
Jamaica, whoreceived their education in the best institutions of the 
West India Islands. 
The Canal Zone school year extends from October 1 to June 30, 
with the following intermissions: Saturdays and Sundays of each 
week; Thanksgiving Day and the Friday following; December 21 to 
January 5, inclusive; Washington’s Birthday; the week preceding 
Easter; and Decoration Day. 
It should be stated here, however, that the Canal Zone school 
system will henceforth undergo a steady shrinkage. The year just 
completed may safely be said to have witnessed the high-water mark 
of the school work. The reduction and the imminent abolition of 
the canal construction force and the substitution of the smaller 
permanent canal operating force will cause a diminishing school 
population. It is difficult at this time to anticipate with accuracy 
the system and extent of public instruction in the Canal Zone 
which will remain after the completion of the canal, but if the popu- 
lation of the zone is restricted to the canal operating force, which is 
probable, not more than a half dozen schools will be required in the 
zone.

SAMOA. 
Report on Progress of Education in American Samoa during the Year 
Ending June 30, 1913. 
By Lisvur. 8. L. Henperson,- United States Navy, 
Chief Customs Officer. 
The school system of American Samoa is unsatisfactory and inad- 
equate. This is partly due to a lack of coordination, and because 
there is no directing authority, such as a superintendent of schools
-P-A-G-E-727
SAMOA. 673 
or a commissioner of education. It is the intention of the present 
governor, however, to appoint a board of education with a superin- 
tendent of schools at its head. 
No data are available from any former report of this nature, so 
that a comparison to show progress is not possible. 
At the present time there are eight recognized schools on the 
island of Tutuila. Six of these are sectarian and two are island 
Government schools; three are for boys, three for girls, and two are 
mixed—both boys and girls. These schools are taught by Catholic 
Marist Brothers, by Catholic Sisters, by representatives of the London 
Missionary Society, by Mormon Elders, and by a teacher from the 
United States engaged through the Bureau of Education. In. addi- 
tion to these schools, there are a number of small local village schools 
taught by native pastors of the London Missionary Society. 
In July, 1912, a conference of all these teachers was held for the 
purpose of devising a plan to systematize the schools of American 
Samoa. “A Plan for the Unification of Public Schools” was the 
result. It included a course of study, a system of grading, and a list 
of standard books recommended for use. Sufficient time has not yet 
elapsed for the schools to conform entirely to the grades established. 
The books recommended have proven satisfactory, with the exception 
of the primary arithmetic, which is suitable only for Philippine 
schools, for which it was written. It is believed that in time the 
“plan” will be followed and will be the standard for grading. 
The compulsory education regulation of 1912 provides that all 
children between the ages of 6 and 13 shall attend school unless pre- 
vented by actual illness or unless excused by the Secretary of Native 
Affairs for good and sufficient cause. This law is hard to enforce. 
Attendance at the boarding schools is regular, but at day schools 
it is very irregular, because the parents do not realize the importance 
of education. Children are not encouraged to go to school. The 
principal of one school reports better work done by those of his 
pupils who are entirely separated from parental influences. 
Samoan children have fine memories and can learn a language 
readily, but are deficient in reasoning powers. Progress in teaching 
English to Samoans has been good; pupils finishing the third grade 
can keep up an ordinary conversation and write an easy letter. 
The following forms of manual training are taught: Carpentry, 
agriculture, sewing, cooking, and general housework; to some extent 
lace and basket making. Great aptitude is shown for carpentry and 
agriculture. Samoans are fond of music and sing a great deal. 
One boarding school has a creditable boys’ band.

674 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF GUAM. 
Area: 210 square miles. Population, June 30, 1911, 12,240. 
(Abridged from the Ninth Annual Report of J. Schnabel, Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Island of 
Guam.) 
  
GENERAL SURVEY. 
During the past fiscal year the progress made by the pupils of the 
public schools of Guam was very gratifying, considering the difficult 
conditions under which the work is done. The native teachers are 
required to give instruction in a language not their own, and the 
pupils are expected to grasp ideas which are scarcely less foreign than 
the language. It would be unreasonable, therefore, to expect of 
them progress equal to that of an American school. 
Instruction in the public schools is elementary, and the acquisition 
of the English language is the chief object. The books are specially 
designed for the use of the native child. The studies of the most 
advanced school are as follows: -Arithmetic, history, geography, 
grammar, and physiology. The pupils of this school are generally 
very bright; many desire to become teachers. The most advanced 
students usually participate in the semiannual examinations, and as 
a rule their averages compare very favorably with the averages made 
by the teachers. The general course of studies prescribed in the 
schools is practically the same as in the majority of the public 
schools in the United States up to and including the sixth grade. 
Special attention is paid to industrial instruction, the general plan 
being to apprentice for a period of four years young men who desire 
to learn a trade. At the beginning they are given a small per diem 
wage, and their pay is increased in accordance with their proficiency 
and aptitude. Each apprentice is under the direct supervision of a 
competent foreman. The subjects that are taught in this school 
are: Plumbing, painting, blacksmithing, carpentry, harness making, 
ete. 
School attendance is obligatory from the age of 6 to 12 years. Any 
pupil absent without proper excuse is fined 124 cents per day. There 
is comparatively little absence. 
A native band has been organized. It has at present 14 members, 
and they are under the instruction of Musician Sgambelluri. The 
progress made by the members of this band has been gratifying. 
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS. 
A night school is conducted, with 26 male and 10 female students. 
The pupils have advanced rapidly under the efficient direction of their 
principal, Mr. D. M. Routson. Following is the routine of the night 
school: Monday—grammar, arithmetic, and_ spelling; Tuesday—

geography, arithmetic, and history; Wednesday—history, grammar, 
and geography; Thursday—arithmetic, grammar, and_ spelling; 
Friday—arithmetic, grammar, and physiology. 
The High School, also known as Agana School No. 2, is the most. 
advanced public school on the island. The school is steadily pro- 
gressing under the supervision of the principal, Rev. A. U. Logan. 
The pupils are enthusiastic in their studies and are desirous of becom- 
ing teachers; the most advanced have nearly always participated in 
the semiannual examination and have made very favorable averages. 
The studies embraced in the higher classes are: Complete arithmetic, 
complete geography, grammar, complete history, elementary phys- 
iology, Jones’s fourth and fifth readers. The lower grades are con- 
fined to elementary studies. 
The classes in industrial arts in the Industrial school consist of 12 
apprentice carpenters, 4 apprentice blacksmiths, 1 apprentice machin- 
ist, 1 apprentice harness maker and 3 apprentice plumbers. This 
class was created by Executive General Order No. 100, promulgated 
September 6, 1905. The majority of apprentices advance well and 
their work is generally very gratifying. 
Agana School No. 1 is divided into 8 classes, with 8 teachers in 
charge. The pupils of this school are graded carefully; class work 
is arranged within an elementary and comprehensive scope, and pupils 
who accomplish the desired results are not held back by dull and 
obstinate classmates, but are advanced to higher grades. The 
acquisition of the English language is the chief object of the school. 
The progress of School No. 3 during the past: fiscal year has been 
satisfactory. Miss Magdalena Herrero, the principal, is to be credited 
for the excellent deportment of the pupils. The studies are practically 
the same as those in school 1. 
The Asan School is in charge of Mr. Vincente Ty-dingeo who has 
had about four years’ experience in teaching. The studies are of an 
elementary nature. 
Mr. E. Schwinn, principal of the Piti School assumed charge April 
9, 1913. The majority of the pupils of this school speak English 
fairly well. 
The Sumay School is under the supervision of Mr. A. P. Manley. 
His experience as teacher covers a period of about eight years. The 
routine of the school includes the elementary subjects. A reservoir 
is in course of construction. 
The progress of the Agat School has been somewhat retarded owing 
to the facé that the teachers in charge, usually hospital apprentices, 
are unable to remain on an out-station longer than a year at the most. 
Such changes are obviously detrimental in obtaining best results from 
the pupils. The teacher is Mr. Jose Roberto.

  676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
A new building for Umatac School was to have been erected the last 
fiscal year, but owing to lack of laborers it was impossible. It will be 
erected in the near future. The pupils are doing very well. The 
teacher is Mr. Joaquin Torres. 
The advancement made by the pupils of the Merizo School during 
the past fiscal year, under the direction of the principal, Mr. Jose Cruz, 
has been gratifying. Mr. Cruz has had about six years’ teaching 
experience. The subjects taught are of a practical and elementary 
nature. 
_ The progress made by the pupils of the Ynarajan School has been 
very good considering the fact that several changes of teachers have 
been made during the last fiscal year. Mr. Jose Kamminga is the 
principal. 
The Dededo School is in charge of Mr. J. TI. James. He gives his 
pupils good practical instruction in elementary work. A reservoir 
has been constructed here for school use. 
The Ordot School, situated about 2 miles south of Agana, on the 
Pago Road, was organized in 1912. Previous to the erection of this 
building the children were required to attend the Agana schools. 
Mr. Jose Duenas is the principal. 
At the request of the people of Yigo and vicinity an excellent 
school building, spacious and well ventilated, was constructed during 
the past fiscal year, and the school was opened for attendance on 
February 17, 1913. This school is a great convenience for the people 
of that part of the island, for it is now possible for them to live per- 
manently on their ranches and cultivate their land, much of which 
was apparently abandoned previous to the organization of the school. 
The class of work is of a practical and elementary nature. Mr. A. W. 
Jackson, assistant superintendent of public instruction, is in charge. 
GENERAL REVIEW. 
The schools of the island are in a prosperous and progressive con- 
dition. The teachers manifest a desire to increase their own effi- 
ciency, as well as to inculcate a spirit of progress in the schools. They 
are desirous of having their school buildings and grounds as tidy as 
possible. Changes might be made which would better the present 
course, but it is far better than the old course, More buildings and 
more serviceable materials for teaching, like blackboards, are needed.

CONCLUSION. 
In my opinion it should be the first duty of the Government to 
attend properly to educational matters in order to provide sound, 
useful instruction to all children of school age. A majority of the 
school children can not enjoy the advantages of advanced education, 
since necessity compels their parents to withdraw them from school 
before or about the time they have completed the study of the’ ele- 
mentary branches. The lower schools should therefore receive’ all 
possible attention. I am compelled to dwell particularly on this 
subject, as it is a regrettable fact that teachers and pupils in many 
instances have shown indifference toward the study of the fundamen- 
tal branches and unreflecting eagerness to reach the higher studies 
without due preliminary work. The tendency in many schools seems 
to be, unfortunately, to attempt too much without a thought of the 
most necessary part of the work. 
Although the schools of the island are not what they should be, 
they nevertheless are steadily improving; the people are apparently 
taking a greater interest in the schools than heretofore, and the teach- 
ers are almost without exception earnestly laboring to keep abreast 
of the times. 
While we have a few teachers who have only a superficial knowledge 
of the branches they teach, no practical knowledge of the higher 
studies, and no definite plan of school organization, yet many are 
well qualified for the work and feel the dignity and responsibility of 
their profession

INTRODUCTION. 
The current record of education in the Canadian Provinces shows a 
continuance of efforts to extend the public-school provision and to 
provide for the teaching of manual arts and rural industries. Al- 
though many agencies have contributed to the latter movement, for 
instance, the Christian Brothers, who carry on an extended work in 
the Province of Quebec, the endeavor to make these practical arts an 
obligatory part of elementary school instruction is the outcome of 
the fund contributed by Sir William Macdonald in 1899 and the 
plans adopted by Dr. James W. Robertson for its administration. 
This fund, it will be remembered, was available in every Province, 
and it was provided that after the experimental stage of the effort 
thus set on foot was passed the work should be adopted into the 
school systems. This has accordingly been effected, in theory at 
least, and the special forms of instruction maintained under the terms 
of the Macdonald fund are now so merged with the general work of 
the schools that it is not easy to trace the far-reaching effects of the 
endowment. 
MAIN DIRECTION OF EFFORTS. 
In regard to the new orders of instruction, little can be added to 
the particulars reported in 1912. The general organization of the 
practical training has made greatest progress in Ontario and Nova 
Scotia. In Quebec the movement for promoting rural industries has 
been stimulated by the affiliation of the agricultural school main- 
tained by the Trappists of Oka with Laval University; the institu- 
tion by the university of a diploma of bachelor of agri¢ultural science 
and its award for the first time at the close of the last session have 
1 The chapters iri this report relating to education in foreign countries were prepared under the direc- 
tion of the Specialist in Foreign Educational Systems, unless otherwise credited. 
679

  680 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
awakened new interest in this industry. To quote the official report, 
it has “cast a brilliancy over the whole farming class.” 
While all the universities and normal schools of the Provinces are 
turning their attention to providing means for training teachers of 
agriculture and the mechanic arts, several centers of this work stand 
out with special prominence. Chief of these is the Macdonald College 
for Training Teachers, situated at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, but af- 
filiated with McGill College and University, Montreal. The training 
college, which has already achieved international distinction, is a 
direct outcome of the Macdonald endowment. 
_ The seven provincial normal schools of Ontario prepare students 
for the special certificates conferred by the department of education 
upon candidates who meet the requirements for teachers of elementary 
agriculture and horticulture, manual training, and household science. 
The faculty of education of the University of Toronto provides post- 
graduate. courses leading to a degree in household science, and the 
affiliated agricultural college prepares students for the degree of 
bachelor of the science of agriculture. Queen’s and McMaster 
Universities have instituted the same degree, and arrangements are 
. made by which the first two years of the degree course are given at 
the universities and the last two years at the agricultural college. 
The certificate courses in the normal schools, the diploma courses 
of the higher institutions, and the expert supervision exercised by the 
director of instruction in elementary agriculture, and the inspection 
of technical training, all tend to assure success for the new subjects 
in the elementary schools. 
The Nova Scotia Technical College and the Agricultural College 
_at Truro have effected a combination with the Provincial Normal 
School for the purpose of providing the technical, scientific, and 
professional training required for teachers of practical subjects in the 
elementary schools. The immediate effect of this provision is, so far, 
more apparent in the secondary technical schools than in lower grades. 
A summer school of agriculture and nature study for the teachers 
of rural schools in the Province of Prince Edward Island is main- 
tained by the cooperation of the Education Department and the 
Prince of Wales College at Charlottetown. The course of instruction 
for the current year was arranged for two weeks, and was attended by 
over 250 teachers, or nearly half the total number engaged in the 
schools of theisland. The staff of lecturers was unusually strong, and 
includedseveral well-known professors from New England institutions. 
The traveling expenses and a portion of the living expenses of 
the attending teachers are met from the Dominion grant of $26,000 
for the promotion of agriculture in the Province.
-P-A-G-E-735
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA. 681 
PRACTICAL TRAINING IN ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS. 
In Ontario provision for agricultural training is made in depart- 
ments connected with continuation and high schools, of which 27 are 
now in operation. The teachers in charge of these departments are 
also county representatives of the Department of Agriculture, with 
many duties associated with field work, This prevents their deyot- 
ing as much time to the school work as is desired, although in some 
respects it increases the practical value of their instruction. Meas- 
ures, however, have been adopted looking to a supply of teachers who 
shall be competent to take charge of both the science and agricul- 
tural courses in the high schools. In order to encourage candidates 
to pursue the course leading to the diploma in agriculture, the Goy- 
ernment proposes to offer a scholarship of $100 at the end of each of 
the two years, to be taken at the agricultural college, for every candi- 
date who passes the final examination and is recommended by the 
’ president cf the college. 
The director of elementary agricultural education reports decided 
progress during the year. The grants allowed for school gardens have 
naturally increased interest in the work, and all the gardens are now 
conducted under teachers trained at the agricultural college. Up to 
February 1, 1913, 99 schools had qualified for work done in 1912 and 
were entitled to grants amounting to $4,370. The director observes 
that, if this rate of increase could be maintained, in a few years all 
the rural schools in the Province would be engaged in this work. 
The instruction in manual arts and household science, represent- 
ing one division of the work originally contemplated by the Mac- 
donald fund, is given at ‘‘centers” which draw classes from surround- 
ing schools. The number of manual-training centers reported for 
1912 was 66, of which 14 were in the city of Ottawa, 28 in Toronto, 
5 at Hamilton, and the remainder situated in smaller towns or in rural 
communities. 
The number of household-science centers reported was 51, of which 
Toronto provided 20, Ottawa 2, Hamilton 6, London 7; the remainder 
were in smaller towns or rural centers. 
The following statement by the superintendent of public instruc- 
tion for Quebec covers the chief educational activities in that Province 
for the current year: 
In the year 1906 the department and the Protestant committee of the council of 
public instruction organized a campaign in the interest of the Protestant rural schools 
of the Province. Meetings were held in suitable centers, which were addressed by 
leading educationists. 
The chief subjects discussed were those of better salaries for the teachers, the value 
of training for teachers, and consolidation. Some good results were visible in time 
from this campaign, but more particularly as the Government grants largely and 
steadily increased during the succeeding years. In 1912 another campaign was held 
at the insiance of the Protestant committee, and although, owing to weather condi-   
 
-P-A-G-E-736
  682 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
tions, the attendance at the meetings was considerably less than in 1906, the results 
were more striking and rapid. This was doubtless due to the fact that in the mean- 
time there had been much public discussion, and a greater readiness to advance had 
been developed. The aid to the rural schools was also by this time much more sub- 
stantial, and the school boards were therefore in a better position to take progressive 
action. Salaries have greatly improved and a good deal of partial consolidation has 
been effected. 
At the time of writing a campaign is being organized for the autumn of 1913. This 
work is also supplemented by annual educational exhibits at the Sherbrooke Exhibi- 
tion, which is practically a provincial institution. 
Similar work is being carried on in the form of ‘Regional Conferences” for the 
Roman Catholic schools by the department of public instruction. Members of school 
boards from one or more counties are gathered at a central point and addressed upon 
the questions affecting their schools. Here, too, admirable results are reported. 
The response of the rural school boards, Roman Catholic and Protestant, to the 
demand for better salaries for the teachers has been greatly helped by the minimum- 
salary grants. In the year 1908 the sum of $50,000 was expended for this purpose in 
the rural municipalities of the Province. In 1909 the amount was $75,000; in 1910, 
$100,000; in 1911, $125,000; and in 1912, $225,000. These grants are being continued. 
Any board falling below a certain minimum fails to receive any portion of the grant. 
The minimum is not compulsory, but the great majority of the school boards are now 
_ realizing that it is to their interest to meet the requirements for the grants. 
Another development of recent years is the holding of summer schools for teachers 
in the-subjects of oral French, drawing, and physical exercises. The summer school 
in oral French is of large importance and is conducted on behalf of the Protestant 
teachers. About 15 academies now receive special grants for engaging a specialist 
qualified to give the instruction. The specialist is required to supervise the oral 
French in all the grades of the academy. Facility in both languages is very important 
for the English-speaking people of the Province. 
In his report for the year 1911-12 the superintendent notes also 
that the work of school gardens has made marked progress, 18 schools 
in 45 counties reporting very excellent results in this respect. The 
teachers are said to be full of enthusiasm over the subject, and the 
parents equally so, the latter because they sec in this movement a 
means of attaching their sons and daughters to their native localities. 
At the close of the last year the names of 5,945 pupils were reported 
as deserving reward for their industry and success in the cultivation 
of their garden plots. 
The Council of Arts and Manufactures of the Province of Quebec 
is a private body which maintains classes in arts and trade in the 
chief centers of industry. This purpose is aided by a provincial 
grant, which amounted in 1912 to $16,000, and also ‘by substantial 
appropriations from boards of trade, chambers of commerce, and 
various trade associations. During the current year 51 classes were 
maintained, with an enrollment of 2,633 pupils. These classes have 
been of great benefit to young artisans and commercial clerks, and 
there is a very general demand that the council should be more liber- 
ally aided in its benevolent work.

EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA. 683 
The current report of the superintendent of education for New 
Brunswick gives detailed accounts of four consolidated schools, which 
embody the salient features of the plan originally suggested by Dr. 
Robertson. In each of these schools special equipment is provided 
for manual-training and domestic-science departments. 
In Nova Scotia the stress of effort with respect to the promotion of 
practical training relates to the technical industries connected with 
mining. The training is organized under the immediate supervision 
of a director who is also principal of the Nova Scotia Technical Col- 
lege. In addition to the secondary technical schools, which are 
accomplishing important results, an experiment has been recently 
made in the conduct of mining science courses for boys in the three 
upper grades of the public schools. It is reported that— 
The boys show much more interest in mechanical drawing of common paris of 
colliery machinery than they did in the freehand drawing of the regular public- 
school course. Elementary mechanics seems more vital to them than botany.” ‘The 
chemistry of colliery explosions and of combustion appeals to them to a far greater 
degree than the dry formal statements of the atomic theory, the laws of chemical 
combination, etc. The mining science course is keeping the boy in school for a 
greater length of time than formerly, because he feels that the course in the public 
school contains some instruction which aims to prepare him somewhat for his life 
“struggle in the industry which is the greatest single center of interest in a mining 
town. 
The evening technical schools, which are maintained by the coop- 
eration of the local school boards and the provincial government, 
were in operation in five towns and cities during the current year. 
The provision in the evening technical schools of classes in needlework 
for young women, which was announced at the opening of the current 
session, excited large response, and in the case of Halifax many appli- 
cants for admission had to be turned away. These classes do not 
attempt to teach trades, but are intended to instruct young women 
in the simpler forms of sewing required in every household. 
The Macdonald consolidated school at Hillsborough, Prince Edward 
Island, was discontinued in June, 1912, although at the time its 
reopening was anticipated by the educational authorities. The plan 
has since been abandoned. This school, which was opened originally 
in May, 1905, was a model in all respects and the hope was enter- 
tained that it might lead to the uplift of rural education throughout 
the island. During the first three years of its existence the school 
was maintained at the expense of the Macdonald fund, but in 1908 
the six districts for which the school provided were requested to 
increase their taxes from 11 to 40 cents on every $100 worth of 
assessed property to meet the expenditure for this institution, and 
since that time opposition to the enterprise has been increasing, and 
finally four of the districts withdrew from its support. Presumably 
 
-P-A-G-E-738
    684 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the failure of this school, which was due entirely to local and personal 
causes, will interfere for a long time with attempts at consolidation. 
It is noticeable, however, that two school districts have since united 
without any outside intervention to maintain a two-room school, 
replacing two 1-room schools; this example may be followed by other 
districts. 
The provincial government has increased its appropriation for the 
schools of the island by a fund which adds approximately 20 per cent 
increase in salary to all teachers, with provision for the monthly pay- 
ment of salaries instead of quarterly, as heretofore. 
The consolidated school has not been adopted to any great extent 
in the eastern Provinces of Canada, but is making progress in the west, 
particularly in Manitoba. The movement in this Province seems to 
have been spontaneous with the taxpayers, and therefore it commands 
that popular support which is wanting in the east. Two consolidated 
schools were established in 1906; they numbered 40 in 1912, and plans 
for additional schools for 1913 were reported. Interest in the system 
has been fostered by an illustrated bulletin issued by the department 
- of education. This publication sets forth in graphic form the 
advantages of the system and excites emulation by vivid pictures, 
contrasting the old-style district schoolhouse with the fine sub-" 
stantial buildings by which they are replaced in the centers of 
consolidation.* 
British Columbia reports the first experiment at consolidation for 
the fall term of 1912. Four district schools were closed and children 
were conveyed from these to the central graded school. So far there 
seems to be every prospect of success from this change. 
During the school year ending June 30 there were 18 manual train- 
ing centers in operation in this Province, and by reason of increased 
appropriation from the Government 14 new centers were opened in 
the fall term. This brings the total to 32 centers, with a staff of 30 
instructors. The instructors of manual training note that a decided 
improvement has been shown in the ordinary work of the schools, and 
the boys in the manual training centers have made models which have 
been of great use in the drawing lessons in the regular course of 
instruction. 
THE STRATHCONA TRUST. 
Lord Strathcona, who held the office of High Commissioner for 
the Dominion of Canada from 1896 to 1911, recently donated a 
sum of money for promoting physical training and drill in the schools 
of the Dominion. This fund has been placed at the disposal of a 
committee called the Strathcona Trust, and the interest on the 
invested money is to be annually divided between the Provinces in 
  
1 See Manitoba Department of Education. Consolidation of Rural Schools, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-739
  
‘EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA. 685 
proportion to the respective population. The general regulations 
governing the trust provide that 50 per cent of the whole amount 
for each Province shall be given for physical training in the schools 
under the department of education, 35 per cent for military drill, 
and 15 per cent for rifle shooting. 
The minister of education from Ontario reports that of the $10,900 
allotted to Ontario $2,180 has been apportioned to the high schools 
and $4,360 for physical training in the elementary schools. Spe- 
cific instructions have been issued by the department with respect 
to the conduct of this training. Similar action has been taken: by 
the other Provinces. 
CURRENT STATISTICS. 
In respect to particulars given in the appended tables, there is 
little change from year to year excepting in the newer Provinces, 
in which the population is rapidly increasing. From the high ratio 
of enrollment to population (Table 2) it will be seen that a large 
proportion of children and youth were under instruction during 
the year, but much irregular attendance is indicated by the ratio 
of average attendance to enrollment, which does not exceed 75 per 
cent in any one of the Provinces. The apparently excessive expendi- 
tures for education in the newer Provinces is due in great measure 
to the necessity of providing at once all the material conditions of 
a school system.

STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The following table shows the number of students in high schools 
or in high-school grades in three Provinces. With the sole exception 
of Ontario, the pupils are included in the enrollment given in the 
preceding table. In Ontario the high schools are organized and con- 
ducted very much like those in the United States, but they are under 
separate administration from the elementary, or public schools, as 
they are termed in Ontario. The high schools in this Province are 
not free schools, but arrangements are made for remitting the fees 
when deemed desirable. 
In Quebec the classification of schools is entirely different, the 
curriculum corresponding to a complete high school in the United 
States being confined to private colleges. The public schools in this 
Province have upper grades termed ‘model’ and ‘“academic’’; and 
the studies of the last year and sometimes of the last two years 
partake somewhat of the nature of high-school studies. from these 
observations it will be seen that the only common basis for determin- 
ing the number of high-school pupils in the several Provinces, using 
the term as it is understood in the United States, is that of branches 
of study.

THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL TRAINING AND TECHNICAL 
EDUCATION. 
The greatest event ia the educational record of the Canadian 
Dominions for the year is the publication of the report of the royal 
commission on industrial training and technical education. The 
order under which this commission was constituted was based upon 
the report of a committee of the Privy Council, approved by His 
Excellency the Governor General (of Canada), June 1, 1910, which is 
here cited: 
Report of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor 
General on the 1st of June, 1910. 
On a memorandum dated May 28, 1910, from the Minister of Labor, stating that in- 
dustrial efficiency is all important to the development of the Dominion and to the pro- 
motion of the home and foreign trade of Canada in competition with other nations 
and can be best promoted by the adoption in Canada of the most advanced systems 
and methods of industrial training and technical education. 
The Minister further states that the Premiers of the several Provinces of the Domin- 
ion have expressed on behalf of the Governments of their respective Provinces, 
approval of the appointment by the Federal authorities of a Royal Commission on 
Industrial Training and Technical Education. 
The Minister recommends that authority be granted for the appointment of a Royal 
Commission to inquire into the needs and present equipment of the Dominion as re- 
spects industrial training and technical education, and into the systems and methods 
of technical instruction obtaining in other countries; the said Commission to be ap- 
pointed pursuant to vote No. 477 of the supplementary estimates for the fiscal period 
ending March 31, 1910, and to consist of the following gentlemen, viz: 
James W. Robertson, Esq., C.M.G., LL.D., of Montreal, Que., chairman. 
Hon. John N. Armstrong, Esq., of North Sydney, N.S.

M. Gaspard De Serres, of Montreal, Que. 
Gilbert M. Murray, Esq., B.A., of Toronto, Ont. 
David Forsyth, Esq., M.A., of Berlin, Ont. 
James Simpson, Esq., of Toronto, Ont. 
The Minister further recommends that the said Commissioners be instructed and 
empowered to pursue their investigations at such localities as may appear necessary, 
in the Dominion of Canada, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 
the United States of America, France, Germany, and, subject to the approval of the 
Minister, elsewhere on the continent of Europe; also that the purpose of the Com- 
mission shall be that of gathering information, the information when obtained to be 
carefully compiled, and together with such recommendations as it may seem expedient 
to the Commission to make, published in a suitable report to be at the disposal of the 
Provinces and available for general distribution. 
The Minister further recommends that the Commissioners be appointed under the 
provisions of the statute respecting inquiries concerning public matters, and report 
the results of their investigations together with their recommendations to the Minister 
of Labor. 
The Minister further recommends that Mr. Thomas Bengough, of Toronto, be 
appointed secretary and reporter to the said Commission. 
The Committee submit the same for approval. 
(Signed) F. K. Bennetts, 
Asst. Clerk of the Privy Council. 
As a result of the decisions reached by the commission, they 
recommend large grants from the Dominion treasury as follows: 
First. That for elementary education a fund should be provided 
from a Dominion parliamentary grant, which should not be less than 
$350,000 a year for 10 years; this fund to be divided into nine por- 
tions in proportion to the population in each of the nine Provinces 
as determined by the latest census, and allotted to each Province in 
amounts not exceeding 75 per cent of the amount which such Province 
had paid during the immediate preceding fiscal year for the promo- 
tion and support of manual training, nature study, and prevocational 
work in elementary schools. 
Second. The commission recommend that the sum of $3,000,000 
be provided annually for a period of 10 years by the Parliament of 
Canada and paid annually into a Dominion development fund. 
With regard to the distribution of the fund, it is recommended that 
not less than 75 per cent of the amount annually added to the fund 
shall be— : 
divided into nine portions, in proportion to the population in each of the nine Proy- 
inces as determined by the latest census, and allotted to each Province accordingly, 
for development undertakings therein. Each of the said nine portions of the fund to 
be administered as the ‘‘(name of the Province) Account of the Dominion Develop- 
ment Fund”; and the remainder of the fund to be administered as the “General 
Account of the Dominion Development Fund.”

RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
In view of the developments in European countries and of the tes- 
timony taken by the commissioners in Canada itself, they make 
sweeping recommendations with respect to the provision of voca- 
‘tional education for young people between 14 and 18 years of age 
who do not intend to pursue university and higher technical courses. 
While urging that ‘all children to the age of 14 years should receive 
the benefits of elementary general education up to at least the stand- 
ards provided by the school systems of the place or Province where 
they live,” they recommend that after 12 years of age, for the chil- 
dren whose parents expect them to follow manual occupations, train- 
ing in the school ‘‘should have as close relation as practicable to the 
productive, constructive, and conserving occupations to be followed 
after the children leave school.”   
DOMINION DEVELOPMENT. 
In their plan for nationalizing the proposed system of industrial 
training and technical education the commissioners enter into minute 
details of political organization and social conditions which pertain 
exclusively to Canada, but the considerations upon which the plan 
is based are pertinent to the United States, and for this reason are 
here cited: 
1. It is important to adopt a plan which will secure the largest degree of public 
confidence and maintain the largest measure of public interest and cooperation. 
2. It is important to adopt a plan which will preserve provincial control, encourage 
local initiative, and develop local responsibility. 
3. It is important that there should be a large number of persons representing man- 
ufacturing industries, trades, commerce, transportation, agriculture, forestry, mining, 
fisheries, housekeeping, and education, ready to take the initiative in local under- 
takings and able to cooperate in making effective application to the needs of localities 
of financial grants and any other assistance. In the opinion of the commission, a 
policy which would be applied wholly or mainly by directive authority from head- 
quarters, leaving to local centers little initiative or responsibility, would not accom- 
plish much for a long time. 
4. It is important that there should be in each Province a central body or authority, 
which could bring to bear on all proposals from local centers the wide knowledge and 
practical experience of capable men and women familiar with education and with 
industrial, agricultural, and housekeeping problems. Such a central body would be 
able to supply information for the guidance of local authorities at the beginning of 
their work, and to furnish advisory assistance through experts of high ability. 
Through tho meetings and discussions of such a central body the permanent officials 
charged with the administration would be kept in touch with public opinion as to the 
particular needs of localities, as to the suitability and acceptability of schemes pro- 
posed, and as to the practicability of having such schemes supported and carried out. 
The central body would also serve the purpose of a clearing house through which an 
intimate knowledge of the results irom experience in one locality would be made 
available to other communities.

5. Itisimportant to adopta plan, whereby the Dominion, the Provinces, the localities, 
and individuals will cooperate and each contribute in some well-considered and 
equitable proportion to the cost of development undertakings. A plan of organizal 
tion which provides for the financial support from communities being properly articu- 
lated with financial grants from central authorities would tend to bring about effi- 
ciency and stability. A long time is required to realize upon educational work; 
and continuity of effort to meet recognized needs is essential. The plan should be 
such as would insure concurrent progressive action in the same direction by the cen- 
tral and local bodies. Provision should be made for efficiency audits, in order that 
each contributing authority may be assured that the money is being used for the 
purpose for which it is granted, and that the work is being well done. 
6. It is important to adopt a plan which will insure that the national interests, as 
well as the local points of view, will be considered. 
7. It is important that there should be a Dominion consultative body, through 
which the widest knowledge and experience could be put at the service of all the Proy- 
inces and thus be brought to bear on problems and undertakings of consequence to 
them all. 
8. It is important that there should be a Dominion authority competent to co- 
operate with provincial authorities, to provide expert counsel to any Province which 
might not be adequately organized or staffed to render service in that respect to all 
localities and industries within its borders, and to promote scientific industria- 
research and the diffusion of knowledge resulting therefrom. 
EDUCATION OF INDIANS. 
The Indian population of Canada is estimated at about 105,000, 
who are found mostly in the northwestern Territories and in the 
Provinces very recently formed from the Territories. The Dominion 
Government makes a provision for the instruction of the Indians, 
the schools themselves being under the direction generally of denom- 
inational managers. The following report gives recent particulars 
with reference to this work in British Columbia:! 
On May 25, at the St. Eugene Mission on the Kootenay Indian Reservation, 6 miles 
north of Cranbrook, British Columbia, occurred the dedicatory exercises attending the 
formal opening of the Kootenay Industrial School for Indian children of the 
Kootenay and Shuswap tribes, which number nearly 600 people. 
The building was completed in January last, after being 18 months under construc- 
tion, as the inconvenient location and the rigors of the climate greatly delayed work 
at times. The school is a handsome structure of cement block and brick construc- 
tion, with molded concrete trimmings and some granite. The style of architecture 
is very similar to that of the old Spanish missions and produces a very pleasing effect. 
The main structure is 167 by 67 feet, with a chapel connection on the rear 25 by 
47 feet. There are three stories, including the basement which is finished. The de- 
sign is such as to allow the housing and instruction of the boys in one end of the build- 
ing and the girls in the other, while the central portion contains the executive offices, 
staff rooms, dispensary, hospital ward, guést rooms, reception rooms, etc. 
The instruction rooms for the boys consist of a large classroom and a well-equipped 
manual-training room, while the girls are provided with classroom and sewing room 
corresponding in size to the boys’ rooms. Large recreation rooms are provided in the 
basement. All living, sleeping, and instruction accommodations are provided for 
90 pupils and a staff of maintenance and instruction of six. 
  
1For this report the office is indebted to Mr. Frank C. Denison, United States consul at Fernie, British 
Columbia.
-P-A-G-E-745
    
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN CANADA. 691 
The school is thoroughly modern in all its appointments, with a very efficient 
system of hot-water heating and ventilation. Electric light is generated by an inde- 
pendent unit consisting of a horizontal gas engine directly connected to a 15-kilowatt 
generator. The bread-kneading machinery, which is being installed, will be elec- 
trically driven. Provisions have also been made to light the modern farm buildings 
which are being erected for use in connection with the institution. 
Water for use of the school comes by gravity from a stream through wooden pipes 
to a large underground ron storage tank, from which it is pumped into another under- 
ground iron tank by a combined pump and air compressor driven by a small gasoline 
engine working automatically, and which puts the water in the pneumatic tank 
under 40 pounds pressure. 
Plumbing fixtures of the best American design are used generously throughout 
the building. There are well-equipped shower-bath rooms in the basement. A 
sewerage system has been installed, including a septic tank, the effluent of which is 
distributed in the porous soil by drain tile. Much of the equipment of the building 
throughout is of American manufacture. 
The cost of the structure alone was approximately $100,000, while the furnishing 
and equipment cost several thousand more. 
The school, while constructed by the Dominion Government, is under the manage- 
ment of the Sisters of Charity and replaces a number of old frame buildings which 
were used for that purpose until this year. 
The Department of Indian Affairs of the Dominion Government employs the 
sectarian method of education of its Indian wards, and it is worthy of notice that this 
policy is directly the opposite of the secular method in use by the American Gov- 
ernment. 
The Kootenay Industrial School is the first of a series planned by the department 
of Indian affairs under the supervision of the superintendent of education for the 
purpose of bringing the education of the Indian to a higherstandard. Where schools 
are in bad shape, new ones will be built and the old buildings demolished, while 
other schools will be remodeled. 
Tenders have been let for a new school replacing the old buildings at the Sarcee 
Indian Reservation near Calgary and for additions to the school at Kamloops and 
other places. Before the season is over the department will probably call for tenders 
fora large school at Norway House. 
While managed directly by the particular sectarian denomination whose religion 
the tribe has adopted, the schools are under the ultimate control of the department of 
Indian affairs, at Ottawa, and inspectors from this department pay periodical visits 
of inspection to these schools. 
The object of the education of the Indian is to raise his standard of living and thus 
enable him to escape the ravages of the disease which devastates the race and also to 
give him a greater chance of competition with the whites, with whom he is thrown 
more and more into contact as the country becomes settled. The idea seems to be 
that it is a profitable investment to make the Indian a practical farmer, instead. of 
leaving him in a state of lazy shiftlessness. For this reason the education of the 
Indian is along rudimentary lines and involves much practical training. In the 
Kootenay Indian School the mornings are given to recitation and study periods and 
the afternoons are spent in practical work on the school farm by the boys under the 
care of an instructor who sees that each pupil has practice in the operation of the 
various pieces of machinery with which it is necessary that they become familiar as 
practical farmers. The girls spend the afternoon in domestic science work, so far as 
practical to their future needs, and in dairying and poultry culture, etc. 
In this school the children are dismissed from the school at the age of 17 and are 
generally very loath to leave. No further care or responsibility is taken of the gradu- 
ates except that which the Indian agent is required to take. Consequently many
-P-A-G-E-746
692 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
pupils, through the association with their parents and the lack of employment, lose 
the habit of thrift and industry which they learned at the school. This is more 
especially true of the girls than the boys, for the former do not have as much freedom 
as the boys and are placed in closer touch with the old ways. 
In Alberta the department is conducting the experiment among some of the tribes 
of giving aid to the pupilsafter they have finished their course at school, in the endeavor 
to help and encourage them to keep up the standard of living and habits of industry ot 
which they became accustomed at the school. In order to do this one of the first 
things that is done is to encourage the establishment of separate homes by the young 
couples from the schools in order to enable them to escape to a large extent from the 
ever-present temptation of the old life of shiftlessness in the teepees of their parents. 
To further this end the young man is assigned to a plot of ground on the reservation 
and is loaned the sum of $300 by the department, in order to aid him to build a house 
and get his-crops started. The money is all to be returned to the Government in five 
years without interest. The girl is presented with household utensils to the value of 
$75. 
‘The experiment has béen in progress less than five years, but itis reported as working 
out very satisfactorily and it is understood that itis the intention of the department to 
inaugurate a similar scheme among the graduates of the Indian schoolsin this Province. 
This is in line with the proposed rejuvenation of the educational system. 
There are 104,956 Indians in Canada, of which number 24,781 are in the Province 
of British Columbia,

MEXICO. 
Mexico is a federative Republic, consisting of 27 States, 3 Terri- 
tories, and a Federal district. In this district and in the Territories 
the National Government has control of education. By an act of 
July 1, 1911, the Government was also authorized to establish ele- 
mentary schools for the natives up to a certain number in any one 
of the States where the need is great. With these exceptions, the 
control of education rests with the several State authorities. 
The political disasters of the year have prevented progress in the 
large plans that were formulated by President Madero, but measures 
have been taken to carry out the act of 1911 in respect to schools 
for natives. A report for 1912 shows that 209 schools thus author- 
ized had been established, of which all but 42 were outside the 
Federal district. Including 9,537 pupils in the Government schools 
at the capital, the total enrollment in schools of this class was 13,616. 
Of the buildings occupied by these schools, 56, representing a value 
of $122,350, were the property of the State. This provision marks 
the beginning of a definite policy with respect to the neglected 
native population and promises to rouse local efforts for the increase 
and improvement of the schools for both the native and white 
inhabitants which are maintained by the States themselves. 
In the State of Oaxaca, on the Pacific coast, interest has recently 
been awakened in the business and educational methods of the 
United States. The American consular agent at the city of Oaxaca, 
the State capital, calls attention to the experience of a local factory 
which had leased a number of complicated machines of American 
make, with contract for purchase in a certain time. After paying 
a royalty for some years with little success, because of the want of 
expert machinists, a young man from the factory was sent to the 
United States to work in the shops where the machines are made, 
693  
-P-A-G-E-748
  694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
in order that he might learn how to keep up the machine repairs. 
Similar action is advised for other young men needing a mastery of 
the English language for commercial business or training in practical 
arts, mechanical, agricultural, etc. 
At Guadalajara, capital of Jalisco, also one of the Pacific States, 
there is a school of arts and crafts which serves as a model to neigh- 
boring countries. During the year, the governor of the Atlantic 
State of Yucatan made a special visit to the institution with a view 
to organizing a similar school in the capital of his own State. 
Following the precedent established in the case of elementary 
schools, the proposition is made that the Government shall be. 
authorized to organize schools of agriculture in the several States 
for the instruction of the laborers on the great estates (haciendas). 
These isolated endeavors mark illuminating points in extended 
areas wanting in schools, in intelligent labor, and in directive ability. 
The Federal district is the only section of Mexico which possesses 
the basis for an efficient system of schools; in this district, at the 
date of the last census (1907) the total enrollment in primary schools 
was nearly 12 per cent of the population, which compares favora- 
bly with the ratio in the leading countries. For the entire country 
the enrollment in primary schools (1907) was only 776,622, or less 
than 6 per cent of the population. 
The civil war that has followed the death of President Madero 
has prevented the progress of educational reform for which he had 
planned. At the same time this interest has not been ignored. 
The budget for 1913-14 carries an appropriation of $13,926,600 
(Mexican currency) for education, of which $2,006,645 was for 
higher education, $440,381 for the secretary’s office, and $954,825 
for the general expenses of public instruction, which leaves 
$10,500,000 ($5,250,000 United States currency) for primary edu- 
cation. 
The provisional president has issued a circular letter to the secre- 
tary of public instruction relative to an adequate presentation of 
his department at the International Panama-Pacific Exposition at 
San Francisco, 1915.?- 
The primary schools of the capital are well organized and have the 
benefits of an admirable service of medical inspection, supplemented 
by anthropometrical tests by means of which records of the growth 
and physical status of each child are secured and preserved.* 
The Federal capital is the seat of the National University of 
Mexico, organized in 1910 by the union of existing schools of law, 
medicine, engineering, and architecture, to which was added a 
graduate school for scientific research.

There are also at the capital a School of Fine Arts, National Con- 
servatory of Music and Declamation, Higher School of Administra- 
tion and.Commerce, a national trade school for men, and a school of 
arts and crafts for girls. Scientific interests are promoted by numer- 
ous societies, and the graduate school of the university promises to 
become an important center of research. One of the last enterprises 
fostered by President Madero was the meeting of the first Mexican 
Scientific Congress, which was held in the hall of the National 
Museum, City of Mexico, December 9 to 14, 1912, under the auspices 
of a scientific society, the ‘Antonio Alzate.”’

CURRENT EDUCATIONAL EVENTS. 
The efforts for industrial development which mark the current 
record of the Central American States are accompanied by a growing 
sense of the importance of public education in progressive communi- 
ties. Although advance in this respect is slow and uncertain, recent 
reports give promise of its steady continuance. Official statistics 
from Guatemala and Honduras show gain in the number and enroll- — 
ment of pupils in 1911 as compared with 1908, and it is believed that 
equal gains have been made in the other States. Exact compari- 
sons, however, in this respect are likely to be misleading on account 
of the imperfect methods of the official statistics. More convincing 
evidence of progress are afforded by special events that have taken 
place during the year. 
The city of San Jose, Costa Rica, has recently contracted with an 
English firm for the erection of two school buildings at a cost of about 
$90,000 each. A Government school of domestic arts was opened in 
the same city in February of the current year with tuition fees at a 
low rate, i. e., $9 for matriculation and an additional charge of about 
$1.50 a month. 
In the city of Guatemala a national school of telegraphy and a 
national college of agriculture were opened during the year, and the
-P-A-G-E-750
  696 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Government has shown the desire for closer relations with the United 
States by the offer of five scholarships to American boys and girls 
desirous of pursuing courses in Guatemalan institutions of learning. 
These scholarships include board, lodging, uniforms, and washing, 
and are good for courses either in military, academic, or technical 
institutions. 
The action was taken upon the recommendation of Minister Don 
Joaguin Mendez, representing his Government at Washington, who, 
in his letter announcing the offer, explained that the increasing rela- 
tion between Mexico and the Central American States is indicated 
by the offer on the part of the Government of Mexico to admit 13 
students from Salvador to a course in the National School of Agri- 
culture, Mexico. This offer has been accepted by the Government 
of Salvador. 
The growing tendency in the Latin American States to provide 
practical training for women is illustrated by a society recently 
formed for that purpose in the city of San Salvador. The society, 
which bears the title “Sara de Zaldivar,” has founded a training 
school for women which has been approved by presidential decree. 
The Government is also extending aid to a college for girls at San- 
sonate, which, in addition to the regular curriculum, gives courses in 
dressmaking, embroidering, and cooking. 
The Government School of Agriculture at Salvador has recently 
greatly increased its facilities for teaching and has added to its 
corps of professors a French veterinary surgeon who had been en- 
gaged in the same capacity in the Republic of Mexico. This insti- 
tution is in charge of a French engineer. A large proportion of the 
pupils are maintained during the course by scholarship funds sup- 
plied by the Government. 
The Government of Honduras is fostering several practical schools. 
Among these are the following: School for the cultivation of tobacco, 
at Danli, which has already been the means of increasing the value 
of the product, one of the most important in the State; a school of 
practical agriculture opened the present year at Siguatepeque, for 
which 34 national scholarships have been allowed; a school at Cata- 
marea for the manufacture of straw hats, and a school for artisans 
in the city of Tegucigalpa. Arrangements have also been made for 
sending students to foreign schools for special training. In this 
number are included five students who have been assigned to the 
well-known military college at Chapultepec, Mexico, and a young 
woman of unusual ability who will study medicine and surgery at 
one of the universities of the United States.

EFFORTS AT SCHOLASTIC UNITY. 
Special importance attaches to conventions pertaining to educa- 
tion adopted by delegates to the Third Central American Conference. 
These conventions provide: 
(1) For unifying the courses of study in the schools of the different 
States. 
(2) For the establishment of central institutions maintained by 
the united funds of the five States and open to students from all 
alike upon common condition. : 
The exact nature of the agreements is set forth in the following 
decrees issued. by the National Congress of Honduras, the first State 
to ratify them: * 
Decree No. 4°. 
The National Congress decrees: 
Sorz Articte.—Let the Convention adopted by the delegates to the Third Central 
American Conference for the unification of primary and secondary instruction be 
approved, which is literally as follows: ‘‘Convention for the unification of primary 
and secondary instruction of Central America.—The Governments of Honduras, 
Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Costa Rica believing that the unification 
of primary and secondary instruction under a common system and identical principles 
must be the firmest basis for rapprochement and fusion of the five Republics of Cen- 
tral America and for the unification of their ideals and aspirations; desirous, on the 
other hand, that the labors that may be performed for the union of said Republics 
may have as far as may be possible an efficacious and practical character, to which 
the realization of such a proposal is undoubtedly ‘bound to contribute; in order that 
this may be accomplished have named delegates: Honduras, Dr. Manuel F. Bara- 
hona; Guatemala, Lic. José Pinto; Nicaragua, Arturo Elizondo; El Salvador, José 
Antonio Rodriguez; and Costa Rica, Lic. Carlos Lara. The delegates having met 
in the Hall of Sessions of the Central American International Office and having com- 
municated to one another their respective full powers, which were found in due 
form, agreed upon the following stipulations: Article I.—The afore-mentioned 
Governments agree that in the year one thousand nine hundred and twelve the pri- 
mary and secondary instruction of each one of the countries shall be made uniform 
with that of the other four, so that it shall be alike in the schools of the five Repub- 
lics. Article II.—To this end each one of the contracting Governments shall in due 
season designate two or more suitable persons who shall proceed as soon as possible 
with the necessary preliminary study. Article III—These same persons, in repre- 
sentation of their respective countries, shall meet to form a pedagogic congress, which 
must be inaugurated the Ist of December of the current year, in San Jose de Costa 
Rica. Article IV.—The pedagogic congress aforesaid, besides other labors that may 
be intrusted to it, shall adopt a common system of instruction and shall formulate 
the programs of each subject, all in conformity with the most advanced principles

PANAMA. 
The State of Panama occupies the isthmus, and, including the 
Canal Zone, has a population of 426,928 (census of 1912).. The 
capital, Panama, is an old city founded in 1518 on the Pacific coast. 
The Government maintains public schools throughout the seven 
Provinces, which in 1912 numbered 294, with 19,362 pupils, not 
including the schools of the Canal Zone. There are a number of 
private secondary schools, and about 50 young men and 15 young 
women are being educated in Europe and the United States at 
Government expense. 
TECHNICAL SCHOOL FOR WOMEN. 
Elaborate rules and regulations have been issued for the recently 
established technical school for women. The school will be under 
the charge of a directress, assisted by an official staff and a corps of 
teachers whose duties are carefully defined. Provision is made for 
both boarding and day departments, the number of students being 
determined by the capacity of the buildings. For admission it is 
required that a candidate shall give testimonials of character, shall 
be not less than 14 years of age nor above 20, in good health, and 
that she shall have completed the course of elementary instruction. 
Students are admitted for three months on probation, after which 
they may be regarded as full members of the school. 
   
-P-A-G-E-754
  700 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The scholastic branches obligatory for all pupils are Spanish, arith- 
metic, and elements of bookkeeping, hygiens and home sanitation, 
elements of science, geography, and national history, English domestic 
and moral economy. Lineal drawing, gymnastics, writing, and 
machine drawing are also required. The industrial instruction con- 
sists of the following branches, which may be increased or diminished 
according to the course pursued: Cooking, darning and repairing, 
obligatory for all pupils; washing and ironing, obligatory for board- 
ing and semiboarding, but elective for day pupils; ornamental draw- 
ing, obligatory except for those who take telegraphy or stenography. 
Courses are also given in cutting, fancy work, hatmaking, plain and 
artistic embroidery, and hand and machine weaving. 
The courses are organized for periods covering one, two, and three 
years each. Those who complete the three years’ course are candi- 
dates for diploma. 
THE INSTITUTO NACIONAL. 
The following particulars relative to the recently established uni- 
versity, the Instituto Nacional, are taken from an account of the 
institution by the United States minister at Panama, who is deeply 
interested in the enterprise: : 
This institution was built by the Panaman Government at a cost of about $1,000,000, 
United States currency, and finished just over two years ago. It is situated on the 
outskirts of Panama City, immediately adjacent to the zone boundary, and consists 
of a number of finely constructed and well-equipped buildings of stone and concrete. 
The buildings, as they are at present, would be sufficient for some 600 students, of 
whom some 350 might be lodged and boarded. Provision has, however, been made 
jor raising the buildings another story if required, and if this should be done the num- 
ber of students who could be accommodated would be considerably increased. 
The institute experienced some peculiar difficulties during the 
experimental year, but in the summer of 1912 the Government ~ 
secured the services of Dr. Edwin G. Dexter, who had formerly been 
chief of the department of public instruction in Porto Rico, and who 
had thus gained valuable experience in dealing with conditions similar 
to those in Panama. Under Dr. Dexter’s administration the insti- 
tute is making rapid progress. The number of students is at present 
about 400, all natives of Panama, of whom half live in dormitories. 
Tuition is free, and $20 covers the charge for board and lodging. The 
Government offers a number of scholarships, which are attained by 
competitive examination and entitle the holders to free board and 
lodging. 
The courses of instruction at the institute are organized in three 
divisions: 
(1) The lycée, which offers courses occupying six years, at the 
end of which the bachelor’s degree is given to successful students. 
These courses are about equivalent to those of the less advanced high
-P-A-G-E-755
EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES, 701 
schools in the United States. Provision has so far been made only 
for the first three years of the lycée course, as students are not suffi- 
ciently advanced for the higher classes, and no degree has yet been 
granted. 
(2) The normal school, which has courses extending over four years. 
A practice school enables students to scquire experience in the art 
of teaching. 
(3) The commercial school, which has only recently been opened. 
While the Instituto Nacional is not at present a university, it 
possesses the buildings and a nucleus out of which in time a university 
organization may develop, and it is the desire of President Porras, 
publicly expressed, that it should become a central institution draw- 
ing students from Central America and South America. For this 
purpose, in his judgment, a chair of English literature and a library 
well supplied with modern works are indispensable. With such pro- 
vision and a strong teaching corps, students would have the double 
advantage of coming under the influences of a modern university, 
while at the same time pursuing a Spanish curriculum in a Spanish 
milieu. 
STATES OF SOUTH AMERICA. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The increasing relations, political and commercial, between the 
United States and the Latin American countries make it extremely 
important that there should be a clear understanding in this country 
of educational theory and’ practice in these sister Republics. With 
few exceptions they lack the essential conditions of an organized sys- 
tem of popular education, in particular the influence of a strong mid- 
dle class, progressive and democratic, which in all modern States has 
proved the source and support of efficient systems of popular educa- 
tion. On the other hand, the leading class, or aristocracy, have a 
system of education which preserves traditions and ideals derived 
from the Old World. Higher education is greatly prized and well 
supported, and foreigners who come into relation with the official and 
professional classes are esteemed in proportion as they give evidence 
of that high culture which reveals itself in sentiment and manners. 
The universities and colleges, the two divisions of higher education, 
have a history extending from the colonial period to the present time. 
Six universities were established at different centers during the Span- 
ish occupation, and in many of the States the early period of inde- 
pendent existence was marked by the creation of universities which 
became nurseries of new political and social ideals. At this time  
-P-A-G-E-756
  702 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
French influences prevailed and led to the establishment, in several 
cities, of special schools for the promotion of science and art. 
The patriotic leaders in the revolutions which freed South America 
from Spanish rule were animated by the doctrines of the revolutionary 
leaders in France, and adopted the same theories of popular educa- 
tion, but in the general absence of centralized authority these theories 
were put in practice only in the capital cities and in the districts re- 
served to governmental control. Every subsequent revival of interest 
in popular education has been limited to these centers, and the present 
efforts on the part of the leading States to educate their entire 
population are met with indifference and apathy, outside of a few 
progressive centers. In other words, there is no diffused public 
opinion and purpose in support of these efforts. 
The three leading States of South America—Argentina, Brazil, and 
Chile—together have a population of about 30,000,000, or nearly two- 
thirds the entire population of the southern continent. Of this total, 
Brazil comprises about 18,000,000, largely concentrated in the 
Atlantic States, while the interior States are for the most part unset- 
tled and undeveloped. The annual emigration from Europe to. these 
countries is large, amounting for Brazil in 1912 to 180,182, of whom 
the majority were agriculturists from southern Europe. Argentina 
has been fortunate in drawing to her fertile lands colonies of Ger- 
man settlers. 
The Commissioner’s Report for 1912 presented a summary of pri- 
mary school enrollment in the States of South America; at that time 
Argentina and Chile exceeded the other States in the proportion of 
their populations in primary instruction, namely, 9 per cent and 8 per 
cent, respectively. Later statistics have been received from a few 
States, but they do not show any marked changes in the relations. 
It is, however, unfair to regard the enrollment in primary schools as a 
measure of current activity in respect to education. A much better 
conception of what is really taking place in the several States will be 
formed by considering particular events, irrespective of the order or 
kind of education to which they refer. 
There is a growing tendency among the States which have common 
interests to form friendly alliances. Thus Argentina, Brazil, and 
Chile have an informal relation popularly known as the ‘‘A B C 
Alliance,” which increases their influence on the continent. By rea- 
son of their prosperity and political stability, they offer the best field 
for the spread of popular education; in these respects, however, 
Uruguay is equally fortunate, and therefore may be classed in the 
same group.

ARGENTINA. 
In his message to the Congress at the opening of the current session 
the President of Argentina referred particularly to the egret 
outlook. On this subject he said: 
Public education proceeds with growing efficiency and volume in this city and in 
the Provinces. The number of schools is increased as the state of the treasury permits. 
The number of students grows annually, as the population increases. Primary 
instruction, the influence of which in the destinies of the nation is fundamental, is 
making steady progress. The National Council of Education does all that it can to 
facilitate the march of enlightenment. In regard to secondary education it still 
awaits the organic law which is to give it a permanent and satisfactory base. Doubt- 
less during the present session this important matter will receive due attention. 
The congress of professors assembled in Cordoba on the 16th of February last contributed 
very materially to the political problem by the able manner in which it dealt with 
diverse themes of importance. The proceedings of the congress will soon be pub- 
lished and can not fail to prove a source of inspiration for all who take an interest in 
the educational work of the Republic.? 
The year was marked by the congress on education organized at 
Cordoba, under the direction of the minister of education. In the 
discussions of the congress education was considered as an integral 
process, and the most pressing problems of popular education were 
given equal attention with those special to the higher provinces. 
Resolutions were adopted urging the desirability of establishing 
urban and rural schools, the increase of the number of normal schools, 
the employment of graduates as teachers, greater liberty for teachers 
in the management of schools, and a change in the curriculum and 
methods of teaching in the normal schools of the country. 
Experts were recently sent by the minister of agriculture for the 
inspection of the experimental farms maintained in different parts 
of the Republic. The national school of viticulture has also been 
the subject of special investigation, and plans have been formed for 
its extension and better equipment. 
In view of the rich agricultural resources of the State, measures 
have been proposed by the minister for the formation of agricultural 
colonies through the combined action of the Government, railways, 
and landowners. Application has also been made to the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture at Washington for the engagement of scientific 
experts to aid in the development of agriculture and rural economics. 
BRAZIL. 
Brazil has achieved distinction in the scientific world through the 
work of eminent savants, and the application of scientific knowledge 
to many social problems. The State of Sao Paulo, which, like the 
Federal district, can boast an excellent system of public schools, has 
in operation a model service of school sanitation and medical inspec- 
  
1 For a copy of this message the office is indebted to the Department of State.  
-P-A-G-E-758
  704 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
tion. The chief of the service is Dr. B. Vieira de Mello, who is 
assisted by a State commission comprising 20 physicians, of whom 4 
are engaged exclusively in the inspection of the schools of the capital, 
and the remainder are assigned to the interior cities and towns. The 
recommendations of the commission as to the choice of school sites, 
the location of schools away from factories, railroads, ete., and in 
proximity to public parks and gardens, have had great effect, and 
the city of Sao Paulo offers many fine examples of school edifices on 
choice sites, well equipped, and provided with laboratory facilities 
for the medical and psychological examination of pupils. 
As an adjunct to the medical service Dr. Vieira de Mello has organ- 
ized an independent society for the treatment of the dental diseases 
of the school children, ‘‘Associacéo Paulista de Assistencia Dentaria 
Ascolar,” which is offering free clinical service to the pupils of the 
public schools. Four schools of the city have been provided with 
dental offices by the society, and it is proposed to extend its operation 
into the interior of the State. 
The organized system of agricultural education in Brazil has been 
extended during the year, under the law approved December 17,1912, 
by the establishment of schools of practical plowing, and five stations 
for the experimental culture of tobacco, cotton, and cereals. 
CHILE. 
Chile has a comprehensive system of education under central con- 
trol and supported by Government appropriations. At each stage 
the public provision is supplemented by private schools, which are 
also partly supported by the State. The following statistics sum- 
marize particulars respecting the system as reported for 1911:

  EDUCATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN STATES. 705 
In addition to the institutions included in the table, there is an 
agricultural institute of high grade, which enrolled 94 students in 
1911, and six secondary schools of agriculture. At the capital are 
situated the well-known Pedagogic Institute, or Superior Normal 
School, the National Conservatory of Music, and a School of Arts 
and Trades. The Government maintains also an institute for deaf- 
mutes and a school for the blind. The appropriation for primary 
education in 1910 was 7,317,885 pesos ($2,671,028), the estimates 
for 1913 called for 7,689,000 pesos ($2,806,485), which was about 10 
per cent of the total Government expenditures for the year. 
Current activities with respect to education in Chile are directed 
mainly to increasing and perfecting the provision for industrial and 
technical training. Two commissions were appointed during the 
year by the Department of Industry and Public Works—one to in- 
vestigate and report upon the agricultural schools of the country, 
and the second a commission of mining experts, to advise as to the 
exploitation of unworked mines and increased provision for training 
mining engineers. Subsequently a new school of mines was estab- 
lished at Copiapo. The sum of 30,000 pesos ($15,000) was also ap- 
propriated for the establishment of a practical school of agriculture 
at Rancagua, and an equal sum has been requested for the support 
of the industrial school already established by the Society for the 
Encouragement of Manufactures. The Eighth Scientific Congress of 
Chile, which was held at Temuco, the capital of the Province of Cau- 
tin, called special attention to the development of the commerce, 
agriculture, and manufactures of that city and the surrounding 
country during the past decade. This region, which 20 years ago 
was an almost impenetrable forest, is now ‘‘dotted with well-stocked 
ranches and farms in every direction, and produces an abundance of 
nearly all of the products of the Temperate Zone.” The most impor- 
tant manufacturing industries of this Province are those connected 
with the lumber, milling, and tanning industries; although not lack- 
ing in mineral resources, these are as yet undeveloped. 
The increasing demand for technical schools has fixed attention 
upon the inadequacy of the system of elementary education for 
present industrial conditions. The national congress on secondary 
education, in the session of 1912, adopted a declaration of principles 
which, if carried into effect, would unify the courses of instruction for 
primary and secondary schools, introduce manual training into the 
former, and organize practical departments in the latter. Although 
Chile is in advance of the sister States in respect to the professional 
preparation of teachers, the congress declared that there is pressing 
need of larger and more varied provision for this — having

regard to the demand for teachers competent to conduct scientific 
studies and different forms of practical training. 
The minister of public instruction has taken measures to induce 
Chilean students who have secured a diploma in any of the higher 
branches of study to proceed to the United States with a view of 
continuing their studies in special directions. This action is taken 
under the conviction that such relations would promote the interests 
of the students themselves and would become a means of increasing 
cordial relations between Chile and the United States. The Boston 
Chamber of Commerce was formally requested by the minister to 
assist in ‘‘organizing a permanent committee’? which would be 
willing to take charge of the enterprise in that city. 
URUGUAY. 
In a historical review of public primary education in Uruguay, 
Sefior Pérez, vice president of the department in charge of this 
interest, recalls the indifference and contempt with which public 
schools were regarded by the leading classes in Uruguay in the early 
days of the Republic. A change in this respect was wrought through 
the efforts of José Pedro Carela, an inspector of primary schools in 
Montevideo in 1868. He organized a society of friends of popular 
education, and with their assistance conducted a vigorous campaign 
in behalf of the cause. He also drafted the organic law regulating 
primary schools, which was passed in 1877. Under this impulse 
Montevideo became a center of educational activity, but outside the 
capital the effort to maintain primary schools excited little interest 
until a recent date. The following table indicates the progress in 
this respect: 
Primary schools in Uruguay.

Among the measures proposed for the present year was the 
establishment of two open-air primary schools at Montevideo, one 
for boys and one for girls. If the experiment proves successful, it is 
proposed to establish similar schools in other cities of the Republic. 
The Government also made provision for a school of aviation,

fully equipped, under the direction of the war department. An 
Italian aviator, Signor Colteneo, was offered the directorship. 
The budget of Uruguay for the fiscal year 1913-14 was fixed at 
36,516,877. Of this amount, # 3,193,132 ($3,295,322.22) was for 
public instruction. 
PARAGUAY. 
The serious purpose of the Government of Paraguay to extend and 
improve the educational system was manifested by the appointment 
of a commission in 1911 charged to investigate educational systems in 
the United States and Europe. The work of this commission has 
given a new impulse to educational activity in the capital city and 
the surrounding districts. A school for arts and crafts for girls has 
recently been opened in Asuncion under the patronage of the Society 
for the Protection of Children and the immediate direction of the 
Carmelite Sisters of Charity. The school has Government sanction 
and will probably be aided by public funds. 
The agricultural interests of the country engage the attention of the 
Government, and measures have been taken for extending the prac- 
tical work and influence of the agricultural college at Asuncion. For 
the present year the minister of public instruction recommends an 
item of 615,000 pesos ($307,500) for the botanical garden and further 
provision for the college. 
Tn its excellent State normal school Dare possesses one of the 
essential conditions for insuring the success of plans for improving 
the elementary schools. This institution conferred diplomas on 39 
students in 1912. The school is under the charge of able professors, 
and its influence is felt throughout Paraguay and in the neighboring 
States.t 
*“‘“GREATER COLOMBIA.” 
The three Republics, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, which 
originally formed the Republic of Colombia, all have laws providing 
for systems of gratuitous primary instruction, and these are obligatory 
in Ecuador and Venezuela. Primary schools may be established by 
local authorities or may be parochial schools, but the latter must con- 
form to official requirements. In all three of the Republics the 
Roman Catholic religion is recognized as a State religion, but entire 
freedom of conscience is guaranteed. The education laws also com- 
prise provisions relating to secondary and higher education; the latter 
is under the control of the central Government in each State; the 
secondary schools, which are generally under clerical control, are sub- 
ject to inspection if subsidized by the Governments. It is needless 
to recall at this time the political and social conditions that have

prevented the full exercise of the education laws in the States con- 
sidered. At present they participate in the awakening on this sub- 
ject, which characterizes the Latin-American States generally. 
The former relations and the common interests of the three States 
are emphasized the present year by the arrangements for the Third 
Congress of Students of the Greater Colombia to convene at Quito, 
December 9, on the anniversary of the Battle of Ayacucho. This 
was the decisive engagement in the war of independence which freed 
these countries from Spanish rule. 
COLOMBIA. 
Colombia, with a population of five and a quarter million people, 
in 1912, reported 4,371 primary schools, with an enrollment of 
272,873 pupils, or about 5 per cent of the population. Naturally the 
conditions of school attendance are most developed in the capital and 
commercial towns. The Government has recently taken measures 
for establishing schools for the native Indians in the territory of 
Arouca, and has approved a recommendation of the educational 
inspector of Putumayo and Caqueta for the establishment of 25 
primary schools at specified points, to serve as models for the schools 
maintained by the local authorities. 
The following table shows the number of primary public schools 
in each Department of Colonfbia and the distribution of the school

ECUADOR. 
The organic law of public instruction for Ecuador, adopted in 1897, 
provides for a comprehensive system of education including three 
departments—primary, secondary, and higher. Primary schools are 
established either by the National Government or by local author- 
ities. They are subject to Government inspection, and must provide 
instruction in civics, morals and religion, reading, writing, political 
geography of Ecuador, elements of Spanish grammar, elementary

arithmetic, history of Ecuador, and politeness; also for girls, cutting 
and sewing garments, and domestic arts. 
The organic law was modified by a law of 1912, which provides for 
the organization of the superior council of education and for more 
effective supervision of schools throughout the State. The superior 
council is an advisory body upon which the different orders of educa- 
tion are represented by members elected by their colleagues. This 
council considers the subjects submitted to it by the minister of public 
instruction, and advises with him as to needed reforms. The law of 
1912 requires local authorities to make provision for the instruction, 
of adults, and also for the introduction of manual training in the 
primary schools and for classes in manual arts and various crafts for 
workmen.

In addition to the schools included in the table, there are three 
commercial schools with 204 students, and one agricultural school 
with 22 students. The university faculties reported for the same 
year 437 students. 
VENEZUELA. 
Venezuela, although not on the level with Argentina and Uruguay 
in the actual provision of schools, is proceeding very systematically 
with the work of reorganizing its entire system. This endeavor was 
preceded by investigations of the school systems of foreign countries, 
and thus Venezuela has had the advantage of recommendations drawn 
from experience, but adapted to the actual conditions in that country. 
A memoria submitted to the national congress at the current session 
by the minister of public instruction details his plan for a reform of 
primary education, which, in his judgment, is of first importance. 
The memoria dwells upon the importance of instructing teachers in 
the principles of science and the industrial arts, and of inspiring them

with interest in the improvement of farming and ordinary industries 
and the better management of humble homes. The introduction of 
manual training and of physical culture in all the elementary schools 
is urged, but with full recognition of the fact that this can not be suc- 
cessfully done without the services of a new order of teachers. 
The minister urges also that a school census be taken periodically, 
and that a competent corps of school inspectors, in sympathy with the 
new plans as well as with the conditions of childhood, be employed. 
The report of the minister is not limited to elementary education, 
but covers equally secondary schools and higher institutions. With 
respect to the former the extension of the programs to include physical 
science is recommended and the organization of a highernormal school, 
as an annex to the Liceo Nacional, for the training of professors 
competent to give this new direction to secondary studies.* 
Statistics for 1912 show a total of 1,367 elementary schools in the 
State, with 43,579 pupils, and 102 secondary schools, of which 58 are 
for boys, 38 for girls, and 6 mixed. There is an excellent normal 
school for women at Caracas, the capital, and a similar school for men 
at Carabobo, each of which has a practice school annexed, comprising 
first and second grade pupils. Of the secondary schools 34 are main- 
tained by public funds, and of the remaining number 21 are subven- 
tioned by the State. 
The secondary course of study comprises four years and leads to 
the bachelor’s degree. As a rule commercial courses are maintained 
in the secondary schools. 
The capital city is the seat of the Central University, and also of 
the National Academy of Fine Arts, College of Engineers, School of 
Arts and Crafts, Military Academy, and a nautical school. 
Higher education is represented by separate faculties of letters and 
philosophy, of law and special sciences, etc., which are not organized 
into a university. There are also many schools of arts and trades 
for working people, directed by religious orders. Twenty-one normal 
schools have been established in 13 different departments. There is 
a school of fine arts at Bogota and schools of mining at Medellin and 
Pasto. 
The total Government expenditure on education in 1912 amounted, 
in round numbers, to $1,700,000. 
BOLIVIA. 
Bolivia has enjoyed a period of tranquillity and prosperity, but two 
conditions have prevented progress in popular education: The popula- 
tion is three-fourths Indian, or mixed, and outside the capital city the 
maintenance of schools is left wholly to the local authorities. The 
larger villages have schools, but they are held in miserable buildings,

often without desks or other equipment, and in charge of teachers 
untrained and evenignorant. The entire number of primary schools— 
public, parochial, and private—in 1912 was 990, with 81,336 pupils. 
Secondary education is given in colleges, public and private, num- 
bering altogether 31, with 180 teachers and 2,177 pupils. The 
instruction in the latter schools is mainly theoretic, excepting in 
the commercial courses, which form a feature of the secondary pro- 
grams. Efforts for the improvement of popular education were begun 
under the former President, Sefior Montes, who during his adminic- 
tration, 1905-1909, sent a commission to Europe to study the organi- 
zation of public instruction in various countries, with a view to the 
development of a system adapted to his own. The commission was 
in charge of Sefior Bustamente, who, upon his return to his native 
land, was appointed minister of public instruction and proceeded to 
elaborate a plan for educational reform. The normal school, created 
at Sucre, was established in accordance with the recommendations of 
the minister and was modeled directly upon the normal school at 
Brussels, which, under the direction of M. A. Sluys, had gained wide 
distinction. The present director of the new institution, Dr. G. 
Rouma, was called from Belgium to take charge of the enterprise. 
Under his direction the school has been the means of creating a 
center of sound pedagogical teaching whose influence is felt not in 
Bolivia alone, but in neighboring States of South America. Dr. 
Rouma is well known also for his researches, which have made impor- 
tant contributions to the pedagogical literature of the world. The 
following statistics, taken from a recent report of the director, show 
the development of the school during the brief period of its existence.

The normal school occupies an imposing building affording a fine 
view of the city of Sucre, and comprises, besides classrooms, a library 
and laboratory facilities. The teaching corps consists of 16 professors, 
of whom 4 are Belgians. Young women were admitted in the second 
year, the Government having sanctioned the experiment without 
giving it official recognition. Opposition, however, has been dis- 
armed, and the coeducation plan was officially adopted at the close 
of 1912, up to which time the young women had been simply recog-
-P-A-G-E-766
  
712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
nized as hearers. With respect to the effect of this policy Dr. Rouma 
says: 
The mere presence of young women in the normal school has made the young men 
much more sociable, softened their rude manners, and imparted to them politeness 
and due regard for their personal manners and appearance. On their part the young 
women have been notably benefited by the relation. They have gained assurance 
and independence, and have ceased to be timid and frivolous. 
The course of study in the school is arranged for four years, of 
which the first two are devoted to general culture, and the last two 
are strictly professional. Music and the fine arts form important 
features of the general course, and musical societies are formed by 
the students, who give fine concerts on féte days. The professional 
course is highly developed in the direction of experimental psychology 
and pathological pedagogy. 
The practice school annexed to the normal is provided with gardens, 
which are cultivated by the children and the student teachers. There 
is also an experimental garden at the service of professors of agri- 
culture and allied sciences. 
The following particulars, taken from the report by Dr. Rouma, 
illustrate the difficulties attending the effort of ambitious young 
people of Bolivia to profit by this provision: 
In November and December, 1911, I was traveling over Bolivia in company with 
two professors from the normal school, holding in the capital of each Department a 
series of conferences upon the scientific basis of education and the purposes of the 
normal school at Sucre. This series of conferences awakened great interest in the 
new institution, and resulted in numerous demands for admission thereto. The 
Department of La Paz sent ten young women, under the direction of a woman chosen 
by their parents and with the sanction of the Government. The Department of 
Oruro took similar action. Several cities sent important contingents, so that the 
very first year it was necessary to duplicate several courses, In order to convey some 
idea of the difficulties attending the journey of these groups of young women from 
La Paz to Oruro and the normal school, it should be explained that in December, the 
time of the journey, as the school year opened in January, the roads are partially de- 
stroyed by the rains, and consequently these young women had to travel for five 
days on the backs of mules across the cordilleras, sleeping at night in Indian cabins, 
and traveling during the day under the hot sun and across desolate country. What 
matter? They sang as they traveled, encouraging each other, strong and courageous. 
The enthusiasm was contagious, and several teachers abandoned their situations in 
order to come up to the normal school and pursue pedagogical studies. 
PERU. 
The movement for reorganizing the system of education in Peru, 
which was started in 1909, has made comparatively little progress 
on account of political changes. The movement itself, however, 
stimulated activity in the capital and in other centers. During the 
present year the military school at Lima has been reorganized. Under

_ the new plans, in addition to the students who are entered for the 
entire course, companies of soldiers from the different divisions of 
the army, infantry, cavalry, etc., will be admitted at appointed 
times for military drill and instruction in tactics. 
The National Agricultural and Veterinary School at Santa Beatriz 
reports for the present year the largest number of students ever 
admitted. The complete course of this institution covers a period 
of five years. Candidates for admission must meet prescribed educa- 
tional qualifications, and must be between 16 and 20 years of age 
and physically sound; the training is gratuitous for students who 
have obtained scholarships by competitive examination, Other 
students pay a fee of $30 annually, plus laboratory expenses. The 
institution was established for the purpose of giving practical and 
scientific instruction in agriculture and veterinary surgery, in order 
to supply the constantly increasing demand for directors of agri- 
cultural enterprises and veterinary experts. A department of 
agriculture has also been established in the National College of 
San Luis Gonzaga at Ica. This department will offer a three years’ 
course in agriculture, including theoretical instruction and practical 
work. An arrangement has been made by which native farmers have 
the advantage of free conferences with the professors on agricultural 
subjects and the right to attend demonstrations at the experiment 
farm at the college. Under a system of exchange, two Peruvian 
students were sent this year to Cuba to study agronomy, and two 
Cuban students were admitted to the University of Lima to pursue 
the mining course. 
In his message to the Congress of Peru at the opening of the ses- 
sion, September 5, 1913, President Billinghurst set forth the need 
for public instruction and the immediate plans of the Government 
in respect thereto, as follows: 
Lacking, as we do, a census taken with due regard to scientific precepts, it is not 
easy to determine the number of illiterates in the country, but even without this 
important information we must arrive at the conviction that public education, in spite 
of the large sums annually devoted to it, does not develop in harmony and in direct 
ratio with the increase of the population. 
Given such a state of affairs, and while the public finances are improving, the prob- 
lem relating to education consists of guaranteeing the results obtained by bettering 
them, as far as this depends upon the Government, in order to avoid an unprofitable 
stationariness or a retrogression that would bring about the ruin of public instruction. 
The time is past when education was considered a remedy, a panacea, for social 
infirmities, and this erroneous idea has been replaced by the truer conception which 
accounts it a powerful and irresistible instrument for the development of the strength 
and skill of the worker, increasing the range of his intelligence and at the same time 
providing him with the means of profiting by the deep stream of universal acquired 
knowledge whereby labor and industry are rendered so fruitful. 
Concurring with these ideas, and actuated by the dogma of true liberalism, which 
recognizes that the duty of the State is to develop the conditions of civic activity and  
-P-A-G-E-768
  714 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
incline toward the formation of the individual character in order to prevent oppor- 
tunity becoming a monopoly and activity being converted into a patrimony of the rich 
and fortunate, the Government is determined to remove all obstacles in the way of 
the ample and effective diffusion of primary education in all parts of the Republic, 
not only by giving more attention to the establishment of elementary schools, but 
also by creating night schools, which shall be in harmony with the needs and the limi- 
tations of the poor classes for which they are intended and in which he who can not 
read will learn, while he who can read will learn more and go further. 
It is the intention of the Government gradually to open the gates of these schools 
not only to those who wish to learn, but also to such as are willing to teach what they 
know. 
The social problem of endowing the woman with the means of earning her own 
living bristles with difficulties and must be based upon a broad and honorable margin, 
which signifies a work or occupation of real utility to society and one for which society 
shall be willing to pay, and in no case something which implies alms more or less 
disguised. 
In pursuance of this ideal the Government has just established in the town of Mag- 
dalena the domestic training school, wherein instruction will be given to as many as 
800 poor girls, of whom 200 are to be brought from the Provinces. 
Although this step that has been taken in the direction of solving the social problem 
to which I am alluding satisfies immediate necessities, the Government is aware that 
the action of this education will have to be extended to the Provinces, and with this 
end in view it is proposed to add to the curriculum of the girls’ schools in the provincial 
capitals a complete course of training in the domestic arts, whereby each pupil will 
acquire the knowledge indispensable for the management of her own home and for 
service, adequately rewarded, with respectable families. 
The Government further proposes to establish in the boys’ elementary schools 
courses of practical arts in order that at a certain age the boys may learn to be carpen- 
ters, tinsmiths, metal workers, etc.; in short, that they may acquire the knowledge 
necessary to present-day life, yet without being condemned to become mere day 
Jaborers. 
In the opinion of the Government all these reforms and amplifications of primary 
instruction can be carried out within the limits of a carefully planned administrative 
budget and without the necessity for augmenting the expenditure upon this public 
service. 
While urging the paramount importance of public instruction, 
President Billinghurst calls attention to the great increase of expen- 
diture for this purpose during the last two decades and the need of 
more careful adjustment between appropriations and actual ex- 
penditures. In 1912 the estimates for public instruction called for 
£336,049.2.60 ($1,633,199); the expenditures for the same year 
amounted to £306,598.8.24 ($1,490,070).*

  ENGLAND AND WALES. 
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS. 
The current year promises to be a memorable one in the educa- 
tional progress of England. The highest ideal of a national system, 
and the largest plans for its realization, have been proclaimed by the 
Government at the very time when local authorities are making a 
stand against the increase of the local school tax. Outside official 
circles, there have been multiplied expressions of approval of the 
elementary school, but these have been met by sweeping criticism. 
The events of the year are, therefore, not only interesting in them- 
selves, but even more so for the evidence they give of impending 
changes in the spirit and conduct of the State-aided system of 
education. : 
A NATIONAL POLICY IN EDUCATION. 
All educational questions and discussions of the year sink into 
insignificance beside that of a national policy in regard to this inter- 
est, which has been announced as a part of the program of the present 
Government, and which was outlined in a masterly way by Viscount 
Haldane, Lord Chancellor of England, in a speech before the Man- 
chester Reform Club, January 10 of the current year. This address 
made profound impression at the time throughout England. It has 
been widely quoted and translated, and has been accepted by leading 
statesmen in other countries as a charter of education for democratic 
nations. 
717
-P-A-G-E-772
    
718 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Tho substance of Lord Haldane’s Manchester speech has been 
reiterated by him on several occasions during the year, particularly 
in the meeting of the National Union of Teachers, but in each case 
with modifications suggested by the occasion. The essential features 
of the address are given in an article by the author himself, con- 
tributed to Hearst’s Magazine. The following citation from that 
article comprises the principles set forth by Lord Haldane, which are 
of universal application to democratic nations: | 
Of all the social problems that have still to be grappled with in the British Islands, 
in England especially, there is none comparable, in magnitude and in the directness 
of its bearing on the national and individual well-being, to the problem of educational 
reform. When you are dealing with that. you are dealing with something that is 
fundamental, and that includes and will help to solve all other questions. 
Next to the material means of subsistence, there is nothing so interwoven with the 
sources of a national power as the quantity and quality of our national intelligence. 
On it depends not merely commercial success, but every hope we cherish for an 
ampler democracy. 
In Great Britain we are a democracy in form and to a considerable extent in our 
political arrangements, but so long as there is no equality of educational opportunity 
for the son of the poor man and the son of the rich man we can not be said to be a 
democracy in fact. The teacher is the great leveler, and his function is not to level 
down, but to levelup. When every boy and girl in the United Kingdom feels that, so 
far as the State can furnish it, he or she has a fair chance of acquiring the knowledge 
that is essential to the accomplishment of the best things in life, you will find that 
the barriers between class and class will insensibly begin to wear away, that the dis- 
tinction between manual workers and brain workers will lose its accent of social 
prejudice, and that all ranks will draw nearer together in sympathy and understand- 
ing, through the consciousness that the career has been thrown fully open to talent. _ 
A true system of British national education is something that I regard as absolutely 
vital to the whole democratic movement in our country; and it is nothing less than 
this that the Government intends to set about establishing next year.* 
In respect to Lord Haldane’s speech at Manchester, Prof. Sadler 
said: 
At last a British statesman of the first rank in public affairs has announced that the 
Government means to focus the thoughts of the nation upon the right upbringing and 
training of the younger generation. And the announcement is made, not on the 
authority of the speaker alone, but after consultation with the Prime Minister, the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the head of the education office. * * * What» 
has happened among us during the last few years is a new kind of revolution, but a 
revolution none the less. Education, generously understood, boldly planned, and 
administered with sympathy and intelligence, is the formula which will secure 
national safety and national health. Lord Haldane may be the Wilhelm von Hum- 
boldt of our day. * * * This is what they have been waiting for—a determined 
effort on the part of the Government of the day to make England a more hopeful place 
to grow up in, and to lay plans which, patiently pursued for 20 years, may not only 
make English people the most intellectual and competent in the world, but (what 
matters far more) kindle in their hearts a spiritual and social ideal. * * * English 
education is not dead, but alive. It has never been so full of life as it is to-day; but 
it needs a focus. And the true focus of every great educational movement is a vision 
of a new way of life.”

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 719 
PROPOSED LEGISLATION. 
The prospect of a new education bill to which the Government 
was fully committed last year has determined the points of chief 
interest in the current record. Discussions and efforts have natu- 
rally been directed to features of the system of education, which, it is 
thought, will be, or should be, modified by new legislation. 
The system of public or State-aided education, it should be 
said, has been greatly extended since the passage of the educa- 
tion act of 1870. Many schools and higher institutions of older 
date have been brought under Government direction; so that ele- 
mentary education in England must be regarded as a division of a 
general system, loosely organized it is true, but comprehensive in 
scope and with increasing interrelations between its different parts. 
Tt was expected that the promised bill would deal with the system as 
a whole, but with special reference to needed reforms in the province 
of elementary education. The disappointment was therefore keen 
when, in July, after many months of agitation and suspense, the bill 
submitted to the House of Commons proved to be merely a one-clause 
financial measure providing for the administration of a new grant 
amounting to £150,000 ($729,000). Of this sum £100,000 ($486,000) | 
was to be applied in aid of loan charges for building purposes, and | 
£50,000 ($243,000) for medical services. 
It was admitted that the proposed sum would suffice for the 
immediate relief of the financial burdens of the local authorities, 
and in his speech supporting the bill Mr. Pease, president of the board 
of education, promised a comprehensive measure at the next session 
providing for what was popularly termed ‘a colossal scheme of 
national education.” Within a month, however, just as the educa- 
tion authorities had become reconciled to the simple prospect of 
immediate relief from financial strain, their hopes were disappointed 
by the dropping of the bill. This action was taken in view of the 
avowed intention of conservative leaders to oppose the bill on 
account of controversial matters it contained. These did not appear 
on the surface, but since the objection could be sustained, the bill 
violated the principles governing financial legislation. 
Although the appropriation to which the bill related had been 
granted in the estimates, it appeared that the part applicable to loan 
charges had been conditioned upon its passage, and therefore would 
not be available. No other measure dealing directly with educa- 
tion in England was submitted during the session; hence the general 
situation is unchanged and the agitation over present conditions 
continues. The main causes of disturbance are: The financial burden 
borne by the local authorities, the religious difficulty, and the lack 
of high schools open to all classes of children. Throughout the year 
these subjects have been kept before public attention.

THE FINANCIAL BURDEN. 
The financial stress, which for the time overshadows all other 
considerations, is due in part to the inevitable increase in the num- 
ber and scope of elementary schools, and in part to welfare services 
that have been imposed upon the school authorities by Parliament. 
The grounds on which the local authorities are clamoring for increased 
aid from the exchequer are summed up by the executive committee 
- of the county councils association as follows: 
* * * This committee (I) records its sense of the unfairness involved in the ad- 
ministrative policy of the board of education with regard to elementary schools since 
1903, whereby (a) the standard of building requirements has been advanced, (6) the 
standard of school staffing has been appreciably raised, and (c) additional duties and 
obligations have been imposed on local education authorities as regards medical 
inspection, without corresponding increase in the imperial contribution in respect 
thereof; (II) urges that the restriction of the special-aid grant to autonomous areas and 
its refusal to rural parishes where the education rate, including special levies, exceeds 
1s. 6d. in the pound, imposes an unequal and oppressive burden, particularly upon 
the agricultural industry; and (III) urges the necessity of providing adequate relief 
in the estimates for the ensuing year, either by a contribution in aid of capital expendi- 
ture (past, present, and future) upon school buildings, or by such other means as 
will lessen a burden which invites daily increasing opposition by ratepayers to all 
proposals for further advancement and progress in educational work. 
In the debate in Parliament over the education vote, it was stated 
by Sir Henry Hibbert, representing Lancashire County, the largest 
in the Kingdom, that in the period 1907-1912, out of a total increased 
expenditure of £921,508 ($4,607,540), the Government had only 
contributed £100,225 ($501,125), and that the proportion of ex- 
penditure contributed by the Goverriment for higher education was 
relatively still smaller; whereas in the earlier year the imperial 
exchequer furnished 55.5 per cent for this purpose, its proportion had 
fallen to 44.5 percent. No criticism was made of the purposes which 
have caused increased expenditure, but the demand that the Gov- 
ernment shall assume a larger share in this increase is insistent and 
it is heartily supported by the present chief of the board of education. 
Among welfare activities the obligation to provide medical in- 
spection brings heaviest expenditure upon the local authorities. 
Nearly a thousand medical officers are already employed for this 
service, and 700 nurses as aids in caring for sick children; there are 
above 30 local education authorities which contribute to hospitals 
for the needed care of poor children enrolled in the schools. School 
colonies were maintained last year by 56 authorities, and 229 out of a 
total of 317 authorities incurred expenditure for the treatment of 
sick children. The cost of this work was borne almost entirely by 
the local authorities; of a total expenditure amounting to $839,000, 
the Government contributed only $250,000. It is understood that 
the additional £50,000 ($243,000) for this service, which was in-
-P-A-G-E-775
  EDUCATION IN- ENGLAND AND WALES. 721 
cluded in the estimates for 1913, will not be lost by the withdrawal 
of the education bill. 
THE RELIGIOUS DIFFICULTY. 
The religious question, which is a hindrance to the free develop- 
ment of the elementary schools, presents in this relation several 
different aspects. The church has large vested interests in the volun- 
tary schools, which, it is claimed, justify the demand that they shall 
continue to give denominational instruction; but in many parishes 
there is only a parochial school, and in view of the church teachings 
the Nonconformists demand exemption from the school tax in such 
eases; further, the teaching force of the schools of the established 
church is recruited from its adherents, which closes a large propor- 
tion of all the positions to the Nonconformists. With regard to this 
matter it was stated by Mr. Pease in his forecast of a comprehensive 
act that the Government would be bound “‘to redress the balance 
between the parties which was heavily weighted by the act of 1902.” 
Voluntary schools (i. e., denominational) would still be retained as 
part of the educational supply, but the grievances of the Noncon- 
formists, which are mainly, though not exclusively, experienced in 
“single school areas’’ (i. e., areas having only a parochial school), 
would be remedied. 
In this connection it is interesting to note that the acute stage of 
the controversy respecting church and civic control of schools seems to 
have passed, and a more conciliatory spirit is manifested by leaders 
on both sides. It is generally recognized that the Nonconformists 
have a just cause for grievance, and here and there experiments are 
made to meet their wishes with regard to religious instruction in 
parochial schools; meanwhile many church schools are passing over 
into the charge of the local authorities. The change in the distribu 
tion of population has had much to do with the change of sentiment 
on this disputed question. It has been said that ‘‘in Wesley’s time 
England was a country of villages; now it is a country of great cities 
and of congested urban areas.’”’ This change has rather diminished 
than increased the strength of the Nonconformists. It is further 
noticeable that, while there is greater indifference than formerly in 
England, the vast majority of parents evidently desire religious 
instruction in the secular schools to which they send their children. 
Hence the idea of establishing a purely secular system of schools 
meets with little favor. ‘ ‘

  722 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
PROVISION FOR ADVANCED EDUCATION. 
The meager provision for prolonging the education of the mass of 
children is due to two causes: Established social distinctions and 
the educational indifference of the working people. These extreme 
conditions are yielding to the force of democratic principles and 
deeper insight into the conditions of industrial prosperity; but in- 
stitutions and social habits are not readily changed, and the present 
endeavors for extending the education of the common people show 
plainly the struggle between old ideals and new demands, and at the 
same time a desire to conserve existing agencies and adapt them to 
the present needs. These endeavors take two directions: First, that 
of extending the scope of elementary education by establishing 
higher elementary schools; second, that of opening secondary schools 
to able pupils from the elementary schools. 
HIGHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The higher elementary schools belong, as the name implies, to the 
elementary system. Their course of study includes the branches 
taught in the lower schools, with special instruction bearing on the 
future occupations of the pupils. 
The official regulations prescribe a minimum standard for premises 
and equipments, and restrict the number of pupils in a school of this 
grade to 350 and the number habitually taught in a class to 40. Ad- 
mission is limited to children who “are over 12 years of age at the 
date of admission, and have been for at least two years under instruc- 
tion in a public elementary school.” Every pupil admitted must 
begin with the first year of the course, unless authorized by the Goy- 
ernment inspector to enter at a higher stage. 
The teaching staff must be approved by the board as sufficient 
and suitable for giving the instruction required by the approved 
curriculum. 
The schools of this grade receive the grant allowed to elementary 
schools in lieu of fees for all pupils under 15 years of age, and the 
aid grant based upon average attendance, together with the following:

It is admitted by the board of education that only a minority of 
the higher elementary schools are satisfactorily fulfilling their pur- 
pose, and in his address on presenting the financial bill the president 
of the board of education expressed the opinion that the ‘‘Cockerton 
judgment,” which prevented anything like higher education being
-P-A-G-E-777
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. - ae 
given in the elementary schools, should be abolished. This need is 
felt, he said, ‘‘in the rural districts where there is no opportunity for 
the children to go to secondary schools.” 
The following statistics show the growth of the higher elementary 
schools in a half decade. The enrollment is included in the total 
enrollment given in Table 1, page 738.

1 Board of Education, Report for the Year 1911-12, issued in 1913, pp. 48, 60. / 
The decline in the number of higher elementary schools in England 
in 1910-11 below the number for 1909-10 is due to the withdrawal 
of the London schools. This city now maintains 42 central schools 
with accommodations for 13,944 pupils, and it is proposed to increase 
the number of schools up to 60. Manchester had 6 central schools 
in 1911, with 2,956 pupils enrolled. These cities have surrendered 
the extra grant for higher elementary schools, complying with the 
official regulations, for the privilege of conducting the schools as 
local conditions seem to require. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Secondary schools in England are divided on the basis of their 
management into three classes: Endowed, proprietary (maintained 
by stock companies), and private (under individual ownership and 
direction). As regards scholastic scope, the following classes are 
recognized: (1) Schools intended to retain pupils up to 14 years of 
age; (2) those which are intended for pupils who remain in school 
to 16; and (3) schools that prepare for admission to the universities 
and provide an extended course of study for pupils up to 18 years  
-P-A-G-E-778
  
  724 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of age. The secondary schools differ radically from the public ele- 
mentary schools. They are not free schools, and up to a recent 
date they were not accessible to the children of the industrial classes. 
These various classes of secondary schools were the subject of sev- 
eral Government investigations prior to the passage of the education 
act of 1902, but this act was the first measure adopted by the Gov- 
ernment which included in its scope both elementary and secondary 
education. Under the second part of this act local educational 
authorities were authorized to take such steps as they deem desirable 
“to supply or aid the supply of education other than elementary” 
in their respective areas. The pressure of public opinion and the 
insistent demand of the industrial classes forced the authorities to 
enter at once upon the duties thus imposed. 
Out of this necessity there has developed a system of free secondary 
education dependent upon the combined action of the board of edu- 
cation, the local educational authorities, and the managers of second- 
ary schools. The principal features of this system are as follows: 
The board of education offers grants for secondary schools complying 
with the official conditions; the local authorities provide scholarships 
covering the cost of tuition in a secondary school, and often the per- 
sonal expenses of the holder; the individual schools make formal 
application for recognition and agree to submit to official inspection. 
In 1911-12 there were in England and Wales 995 secondary schools 
that had complied with the grant conditions, attended by 165,617 
pupils. ‘Of this number, 52,583 pupils were receiving free instruc- 
tion, including 49,120 who had been transferred from the elementary 
schools. 
Dissatisfaction with the present provision for continuing the edu- 
cation of children beyond the elementary stage is intense in the chief 
cities, in which the democratic spirit is most active, and in parishes 
which have neither higher elementary schools nor secondary schools 
easily accessible to children of the elementary-school class. The 
feeling on this subject is indicated by the proceedings of various 
bodies, which will be presently considered. 
MEASURES RELATING TO TEACHERS. 
Special interest attaches to measures recently adopted by the board 
of education looking to improvement in the preparation of teachers 
of elementary schools. 
The arrangement by which young people who formerly served as 
pupil teachers may now continue their education in secondary schools 
insures a broader culture for the future teachers than was possible 
under the old system; at the same time it tends to relieve the 
training colleges, more and more, from purely academic work. The 
regulations for the training colleges issued by the board of educa-
-P-A-G-E-779
    EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES, 725 
tion for 1913 depart from the narrow spirit of former requirements. 
This is shown in respect to the two-year course of the college, which 
leads to the lower diploma, as well as in regard to the third-year 
course, which is open to candidates seeking advanced certificates. 
The general purpose of the regulations is to increase the time given 
to professional studies, and to lessen the pressure of examinations. 
The official circular on the subject explains that the board hopes 
to secure this end— 
(a) by reducing the number of subjects which students are required to study as part 
of their general education; (b) by reducing the amount of ground that has to be cov- 
ered in the case of some of the syllabuses; (c) by providing for one examination only 
(instead of two as hitherto) in those cases in which students take advanced work in a 
subject in addition to the ordinary work; and (d) by allowing more freedom as to 
dividing the examination as a whole between the first and second years. 
The subjects of the training-college curriculum are accordingly 
classified under three heads: Professional subjects, general subjects, 
and additional subjects. The branches under the first head are as 
follows: 
Principles and practice of teaching, hygiene and physical training, theory of music 
and singing, reading and recitation, drawing, and needlework (for women). Theory 
of music and singing may be omitted by students who are incapable of profiting by 
practical instruction in music; and hygiene and physical training may be omitted 
by students taking degree courses in certain cases in which the requirement of these 
subjects together with the degree work would involve an undue pressure on the 
student’s time. Apart, however, from these strictly limited exceptions, the board 
expect that the professional subjects as a whole should be studied by all students, 
whether two-year students taking an ordinary course or students reading for university 
degrees. 
The general subjects are English, history, geography, mathematics, 
and elementary science. To this list is added Welsh in the case of 
Welsh colleges. 
It is no longer required that every student shall study more than 
three of these subjects, and in certain cases the number may be re- 
duced to two. Freedom in respect to this matter is left to the train- 
ing-college authorities, subject to the one condition that some 
attention must in all cases be given to the study of English. 
The additional subjects, which are optional, are intended for 
teachers of a special class or as a means of extending the general 
education of the student. This group includes French, German, 
Latin, physics, chemistry, botany, rural science, and housecraft. 
While great freedom is left to the college authorities in respect to the 
management of the course of study, the official regulations give 
valuable suggestions as to the use of this freedom. In particular, 
it is advised that a weak student, in addition to the professional side 
of his work, should confine his attention to the ordinary course in 
general subjects. On the other hand, opportunity is offered for a 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-780
   
    726 EDUCATION REPORT, 1918. 
strong student to follow the advanced course while pursuing the 
professional studies. 
The examination for the teachers’ certificate may take place at 
the end of the two-year course or be divided between the two years. 
The certificate will state the general subjects included in the course 
taken by the student, distinguishing between the ordinary course 
and the advanced course. The distinction between the two, that is 
the ordinary and the advanced, is defined in the regulations. 
Certain training colleges with university affiliations are authorized 
to receive students for a three-year course of training, leading up to 
a degree in the university with which the college is connected.! 
Recent regulations have also provided for an additional fourth year 
for students desiring an “honors course.’ In respect to this provi- 
sion Mr. Pease, in his address on the budget, said: 
There has been in our training colleges, unfortunately, often too much pressure 
upon those who are endeavoring to do too much in their two or three years’ period of 
training. If they have not only to secure a university degree, but pass examinations, 
and be properly trained to teach in the schools, four years, of course, is really a reason- 
able period in which to expect all this to be done, and the practice has been adopted 
in ten institutions of carrying out a four-year course—three years in connection with 
the work for the degree and in the fourth year preparation for the teaching profession. 
At the Universities of London, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Bristol (both men 
and women), Oxford, and in three Welsh colleges this arrangement has been arrived 
at with the boards, and success is attending the efforts which they are now making, 
and I am glad to say that while in 1911-12 the course was being taken by 410 students, 
there are in these colleges at present taking the course 781 students. 
The measures pertaining to the preparation of teachers derive spe- 
cial importance from the fact that the Government grant for schools 
is conditioned partly upon the grade certificate held by the head 
teacher and the proportion of trained teachers employed. In the 
ultimate analysis, however, the local authorities determine the prog- 
ress of education. Hence a survey of this interest, which is limited 
to Government activities, is incomplete and even misleading. 
LOCAL ACTIVITIES. 
The local authorities for education in England and Wales number 
818, of which 63 are counties, 75 are county boroughs, 180 are 
boroughs or urban districts that have control of elementary educa- 
tion only. Upon these authorities rests, in the main, the provision 
of elementary schools, which now enroll above 6,000,000 children, 
employ a force of 185,000 teachers, and are maintained at an annual 
expenditure of $116,000,000. Of this amount the local authorities 
supply a little more than one-half, while for the promotion of higher 
education they contribute about $10,000,000 additional.

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES, 127 
It is impossible here to do more than suggest the extent and 
variety of the work in charge of the education committees of a few 
selected counties and county boroughs. 
London, which is an independent county, has a population greater 
than many kingdoms, and the education committee has under imme- 
diate supervision nearly 882,000 children, of whom about 750,000 are 
enrolled in elementary schools. For the maintenance of these schools 
the county expends nearly £5,000,000 ($23,300,000) annually. This 
amount covers many auxiliary services, such as the feeding of necessi- 
touschildren. This provision is made in part by voluntary subscrip- 
tions, and the work is carried on by private societies; the council 
voted for this purpose for the current year £96,825 ($484,000). In 
a single month of 1911 meals were supplied to 41,134 children, and 
the total number of meals given in the entire year was 8,328,009. 
For the work of medical inspection the council expends about 
£27,000 ($135,000) annually, of which the larger part is raised from 
the rates (property tax). It should be recalled also that the county 
councils, through their education committees, bear a heavy expendi- 
ture for the promotion of higher education. For this purpose the 
London council expends over £1,000,000 annually, of which amount 
more than half is raised by rates. 
The 70 county boroughs of England and Wales include the great 
manufacturing cities, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, Liver- 
pool, Manchester, Sheffield, etc., all of which make full provision of 
elementary schools and maintain also extensive and varied welfare 
activities, including medical inspection of pupils and medical treat- 
ment when necessary, provision of meals for necessitous children, 
and care committees to cooperate with juvenile labor bureaus in 
securing suitable employment for pupils leaving school for work. 
No attempt is here made to go into details respecting these activities 
in the great boroughs, as they are treated in extenso in a recently 
published bulletin of this office dealing with typical municipalities.' 
The county council of Lancashire, the largest county in the King- 
dom, is responsible for a population of 943,948. This, it must be 
understood, is exclusive of the independent county boroughs and 
urban districts. The following particulars relate to the elementary 
schools under the charge of the education committee for the year 
1912-13: 
Elementary schools, number, 704 (578 voluntary, 126 council). 
Enrollment in 1912, 153,363; average attendance, 133,650. 
Number of teachers, 4,207. 
Expenditure, £497,492 ($2,417,811). 
Sources of income and proportion from each: 
Rates (property tax), 42 per cent of total; Government grants, 57.5 per cent; 
other sources, 0.5 per cent.

In accordance with the requirements of the board of education, the 
education cominittee have undertaken to bring all the county school 
buildings up to a required standard. Of 205 unsuitable buildings, 
139 have been dealt with, and it is believed that the 66 remaining 
will be put in excellent condition within a few months. 
Medical inspection is extended to all schools under the committee, 
and during the year ending December 31, 1912, there were 62,184 
children examined, and medical treatment was extended to 3,720 
children suffering from various diseases. 
Provision for industrial training, including handicraft, gardening, 
and housework for girls, is maintained in 436 schools, with 11,498 
pupils. 
The council has also complete financial responsibility for 10 
endowed grammar schools, haying a total attendance of 5,157 stu- 
dents. In this number are included 77 pupil teachers and 126 
bursars, maintained by county scholarships. 
The council is also doing an extensive work in the provision of 
special classes for teachers already in service; these include classes 
in school gardening, in physical training, vacation courses in cookery, 
light woodwork, rural science, drawing, etc. Instruction of a some- 
what higher order, not exclusively for teachers, is provided in a 
county agricultural school, a dairy school, a county experimental 
farm, field trials at various centers, and a horticultural station at 
which elementary school teachers receive special instruction in the 
culture of garden plants, the care of orchards, and beekeeping.

Higher education. 
- The secretary of the Middlesex education committee, Mr. B. 8S. 
Gott, has recently submitted a report to the education committee 
on the provision made in this county for higher education since 1907 
in accordance with requirements of the board of education issued at 
that time. From this report it appears that in the period of six 
years— 
five schools have been enlarged; a new school for boys, with accommodations for 
300 pupils, has been built at Harrow; 2 schools for girls at Twickenham and Enfield, 
each with accommodation for 220, have been erected, as well as 6 mixed schools 
at Wood Green, Southgate, Finchley, Hornsey, Ashford, and Edmonton, of which 
8 have accommodation for over 300 and 3 for over 200 children. In addition, mixed 
secondary schools have been opened in buildings originally intended for higher 
elementary schools at Finchley and Hornsey. Other plans now in process of com- 
pletion are the erection of a new school for boys at Ealing and a new mixed school 
at Tottenham, for which tenders have already been accepted, and sites have been 
purchased for girls’ and boys’ schools at Chiswick, a mixed school at Hendon, and a 
girls’ school at Harrow. Thus the only work now outstanding of the schemes sub-
-P-A-G-E-783

mitted to the committee in 1907 is the provision of a school for girls at Ealing and 2 
for boys and girls in West Willesden. Middlesex now maintains a total of 22 second- 
ary schools, besides 3 which are aided by the committee. This splendid network of 
institutions seems adequate to meet even the very large increase in population which 
has recently taken place. 
WILTSHIRE. 
(Population, 236,222.) 
Training in manual processes of agriculture. 
In the previous reports of this series attention has been called 
to efforts for the uplift of rural communities promoted by the com- 
bined action of the board of education and fisheries and the board of 
education. Under the auspices of the two boards a rural education 
conference has been held annually for the last three years, each con- 
ference dealing with some particular phase of the rural movement. 
The conference for the current year pertained to manual processes 
of agriculture, with special reference to provision for training in 
these processes two classes of persons: First, children of elementary 
school age; second, boys and men employed upon the land. In 
preparation for the conference, numerous witnesses representing 
various aspects of agricultural industries as related to the desired 
instruction had been examined, and their evidence is included in the 
conference report. Among the witnesses was Mr. Corbett, county 
secretary for agricultural education in Wiltshire, one of the most 
progressive counties in respect to the rural uplift movement. The 
summary of Mr. Corbett’s examination and evidence before the 
committee, as given in the report of the conference, is here cited. 
Mr. Corbett, the county secretary for agricultural education in Wiltshire, stated that 
the Wiltshire County council had appointed two separate education committees, the 
agricultural education committee and the general education committee, and that to 
the former the county council had delegated all its powers and duties, under the 
education act of 1902, relating to agricultural education. He said it was his duty to 
organize the agricultural instruction throughout the county; he also supervised the 
work, as far as possible, in order to see that the regulations and instructions of the com- 
mittee were being carried out. The instruction in manual processes is carried on at 
centers throughout the county, a local committee being appointed to arrange the work 
at each center. Mr. Corbett said that the usual method of procedure adopted is for 
him to write to farmers, estate agents, and others asking them to form a local com- 
mittee for the purpose of arranging classes in their districts; sometimes, however, this 
process is reversed, the farmers making application to the agricultural committee for 
instruction to be given in their neighborhood. It isa rule of the agricultural education 
committee that a local committee shall consist of not less than 5 members, and in 
wide districts there are often as many as 20 members. The local committee usually 
acts for a single parish, but occasionally, as, for example, in the case of instruction in 
plowing, it may represent several parishes. Subject to approval, local committees 
may engage a skilled local man as instructor, such a man being paid at the rate of 30s. 
per week; but where none is available the agricultural committee, on application, 
provide an instructor. Mr. Corbett said that little difficulty was found in securing 
suitable instructors; if a competent man was not forthcoming in the county, he was
-P-A-G-E-784
730 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
always able to obtain one from another part of the country. Instruction is given in 
hedging, ditching, plowing, thatching, and sheep shearing, both whole-time and 
part-time instructors being employed. A thatching instructor, who is competent to 
teach milking also, gives 10-day courses in these subjects. In the morning he in- 
structs adults in milking, and takes boys from elementary schools from 10 to 12 o’clock 
in thatching. In the afternoon the boys and girls accompany the instructor to the 
afternoon milking and receive tuition from him, and it frequently happens that 
before the end of the 10 days they are able themselves to milk the whole herd of cows. 
Mr. Corbett said that farmers sometimes objected to having their cows milked by 
children, but when it was realized that the instructor was always present and was 
careful to see that the animals were properly milked these objections were withdrawn. 
No prizes are awarded to the children for attendance at these classes and they come 
in accordance with the wishes of their parents. 
* * ® * * * * 
Each course of instruction in manual processes lasts for at least 20 hours and is held 
on at least four days, and unless otherwise decided by the county secretary, a class 
consists of not less than six pupils, while nine is usually the maximum number. Com- 
petitions in manual subjects are held after instruction, it being necessary, except in 
the case of plowing, for the would-be competitors to have attended for at least 20 
hours’ tuition. The classes and competitions are usually divided into two or more 
sections, such as junior and senior classes; the juniors, as a rule, being persons under 
20 and the seniors 20 years of age and upward. In hedging and ditching contests 
the competitors are required to deal with about one-half chain of hedge, in plowing 
they usually plow one-half acre of land, and in sheep shearing they are required to 
shear three sheep. The prizes in these competitions, which are provided out of county 
funds, are of the value 25s. first prize and 15s. second prize, while third and fourth 
prizes of 7s. 6d. and 5s., respectively, may under certain conditions also be awarded. 
Sometimes local prizes are also given. ‘The judges are men well known in the county 
and reside outside the district where the competition is held. They are thoroughly 
acquainted with the practical side of the work on which they are making an award, 
having been, in many cases, champion prize winners in their younger days. They 
restrict themselves to judging the work done and do not point out, on the spot, mis- 
takes made by competitors, though a report on the quality of the work is made by the 
judges at the dinner which usually follows a competition. Mr. Corbett said that 
these competitions were looked upon with favor by both masters and men, and the 
day on which they were held was regarded as a ‘‘field day” throughout the district. 
He said that the Wiltshire farmers in general were very pleased for their workmen to 
receive instruction, and as far as he was aware made no deduction from their wages on 
account of the time thus spent. 
Mr. Corbett was asked whether the scheme of instruction adopted by the agricultural 
committee had covered the whole of the county within any definite period. He said 
that in his opinion this was not possible, partly because it would have proved too 
expensive, as it would have been necessary to engage several additional instructors, 
and partly because the committee did not press the instruction where it was not 
desired. On the other hand, classes were frequently held as many as four or five 
times in the same place when application was made by the local farmers, but in spite 
of this fact no complaints as to the unequal distribution of instruction had been made 
to the committee. 
ASSOCIATIONS. 
The National Union of Teachers, which held its forty-fourth 
annual conference at Weston-super-Mare in Easter week of the 
present year, is one of the greatest educational associations in the  
-P-A-G-E-785
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. Weal 
world, comprising 72,400 members, belonging to 519 local associa- 
tions, which are combined in 55 county associations. The majority 
of the members are teachers in the elementary schools, and the union 
itself was formerly known as the National Union of Elementary 
Teachers; in 1889, however, the word elementary was omitted from 
the title, and a fair proportion of secondary teachers are now in- 
cluded in the membership. The union exercises a very decided in- 
fluence in regard both to legislation and to the official regulations 
issued by the board of education. Four members of the union are 
members of the House of Commons, where they keep close watch 
upon all measures affecting school matters. 
At the annual meeting for the present year the subject of the 
general educational policy which the association is prepared to sup- 
port was the chief consideration. The presidential address, which 
dealt exhaustively with the present state of education, summarized 
the principles for which the association stands, as follows: “Equality 
of opportunity for all, regardless of rank, fortune, or social status.” 
While recognizing the great progress made in respect to the education 
of the children of the humbler classes, the president contended that 
there is still ‘a great gulf of prejudice and class exclusiveness dividing 
the schools of the rich from the schools of the poor.” In this connec- 
tion he said: 
We must first concentrate our attention on the primary schools and reform their 
conditions throughout. Until this task is accomplished there can be little or no hope 
of solid educational progress. Many ardent educationalists, whose sincerity and zeal 
are undeniable, take it for granted that the primary-school system is working very 
well, and focus their minds on secondary and university education. Primary educa- 
tion is not on a sound basis, and never will be until its administration is so organized 
that the conditions in the primary schools are as good as those in the secondary schools. 
This is the first point against which we should hurl our forces. When this position 
has been captured, the rest of the campaign will be comparatively easy. 
Among the conditions in regard to which the primary schools suffer 
in contrast with higher schools are the smaller amount of air space 
accorded by the Government regulations to the primary schools, 
the absence of playgrounds, the indifference to sanitary conditions, 
and the inferiority of the teachers. On the last point the speaker 
said: 
The pupils in the secondary schools must be taught in every case by fully qualified 
teachers, while little more than half of the staff of the primary schools can be so de- 
scribed. Elaborate, and in many respects admirable, regulations have been drawn 
up for the training of primary-school teachers. ‘The requirements for the professional 
diploma are most stringent, and the standard of attainments demanded is fully equal 
to that asked for the degree courses of many universities. Yet, having obtained its 
qualified practitioners the State restricts their sphere of usefulness. They are for- 
bidden to cross the sacred portals of the secondary school, and at the same time a host 
of unqualified or partially qualified men and women is sent to compete with them in 
the primary schools.  
-P-A-G-E-786
  732 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Attention was also called to the fact that some measures have 
been made the means of injury to the children they were intended to 
benefit. This was illustrated by the misuse of an official circular 
issued by Mr. Runciman, when he was president of the board. This 
circular provided that no class should exceed 60 in number, but at 
the same time, it allowed a class of 60 to be under the charge of a 
teacher of low grade under certain conditions. Local authorities 
have taken advantage of this provision to the extent of employing 
supplementary teachers for classes of 60 children.. The same cir- 
cular required that there should not be more than 60 scholars in a 
class at any time. This was intended to be the maximum number, 
but here again some authorities have determined that it should be 
“the irreducible minimum” wherever the code permitted, hence 
follows what the speaker described as ‘‘a system of the most brutal 
and cold-blooded hustling.’”’ He said: 
Children are driven out of the infant school at the earliest possible age and in all 
departments frequent reclassification has become the order of the day. There are 
schools in England where every month, and sometimes oftener, scholars are shuttle- 
cocked from class to class in order to preserve the idea of making the classes fit the 
room. 
The president also urged the association to oppose all forms of the 
“half time system,’ including the provisions by which a country 
child is allowed to leave school a year before the town child, pro- 
vided it can be shown that he is engaged in beneficial employment, 
by which is understood some agricultural work. The president 
observed that: 
The spirit of class prejudice is more vigorous and more widespread in the country 
than in the town. There the child of the agricultural laborer is in many quarters 
looked upon as a veritable Gibeonite, fit only to be a hewer of wood and a drawer of 
water. 
As illustrating the dangers which lurk in such special provisions, 
he referred to a recent resolution of the Nottingham farmers’ union 
with respect to which he said: 
This organization asks the State to sanction a system whereby children between 
the ages of 12 and 14 may be apprenticed to agricultural pursuits, and during this 
apprenticeship remain on the school registers and earn Government grants. The 
system will be nominally voluntary; but the pressure of those economic and social 
forces which only dwellers in the countryside can adequately realize will make it 
almost impossible to maintain this apparent freedom. We can therefore treat the 
program of the farmers’ union as one for the establishment of universal agricultural 
apprenticeship in rural districts. 
* * * * * * * 
We have here the Gibeonite theory in all its pristine beauty and can form some concep- 
tion of how regulations about ‘‘beneficial employment” are likely to be worked if the 
program of these magnates is accepted. Their motives may be of the best, but until 
they renounce their class exclusiveness and give their full support to the principle of 
equality of opportunity their motives will not count unto them for righteousness and
-P-A-G-E-787
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 138 
are only fit for what is the frequent end of good intentions. We can not and will not 
revive villenage, even for the sake of strengthening agriculture. All desire English 
agriculture to prosper, but the enslavement of the child is too heavy a price to pay. 
Let the farmers’ union assist us to obtain equal educational opportunities for all, and 
its members will find that their support of a just and righteous cause will have its 
reward in raising agriculture to its true position among British industries. Ifa sound, 
liberal, and general education is good for ‘farmers’ sons,’’ the progeny of Hodge will 
be equally benefited by a similar mental development. Starving the brain does not 
increase the efficiency of the hand. When chambers of agriculture recognize this 
truth, then, and not till then, will the tillers of the soil and the artisans of the town 
be regarded as equals. 
A large part of the address was devoted to exposing the low state 
of rural primary schools, and the farmers’ union was particularly 
urged to assist the national association in the demand that these 
schools be raised to a higher plane. 
In regard to schools for higher education the speaker pointed out 
that the fees in secondary schools do not make these institutions 
self-supporting, but they do erect an effectual barrier to the higher 
education of the workers’ children. He continued: 
There is only one way in which the danger can be averted. The ideal of Victor 
Hugo should become an accomplished fact in our country—‘‘free and compulsory 
primary education for all, free secondary education for all who have the ability and 
the desire.’’ The time has come to cease talking of the ladder from the primary 
school to the university. The welfare of the Nation demands, not a ladder, but a 
broad, firm, and well-laid highway, along which the poorest may travel if they possess 
the ability. 
Association of education committees.—The opinions of the local edu- 
cation authorities with respect to matters of current discussion are 
brought out in the annual meeting of the association of education 
committees, which includes nearly all the urban areas of the King- 
dom, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester having joined the 
association the present year. The great purpose of this association 
is to influence legislation with respect to administrative policies. In 
the meeting for the present year, the three great problems that have 
been already considered were discussed from the local standpoint. 
The address of the president of the association, Sir J. Tudor Walters, 
M. P., dealt particularly with the present provision for continuing 
the education of the ‘‘million rather than the few.’’ On this subject 
he said in part: 
I notice that in regard to our elementary and secondary schools so many of the 
leading experts look at it entirely from the standpoint of everything being a ladder 
to the university. I do not agree with that standpoint at all. I do not want the 
conception of the education system in this country to be simply a process of taking a 
few bright boys and sending them to a university. 
That is an excellent thing to do. It is a good thing for the son of the humblest 
workingman if he has the brain and the capacity and industry to be able to climb 
to the highest position in the land, but I am not going to sacrifice the millions of 
ordinary children in this country for the benefit of the few intelligent ones who want
-P-A-G-E-788
  734 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
to get into Parliament. I think: you want to approach this education question from 
a much more practical standpoint. When I go into an elementary school the ques- 
tion I ask myself is this: ‘‘Is the kind of education which is being given in this school 
one that is best adapted for the majority of the children who attend here to equip 
them to live their life in a particular trade?” Do not mistake me. I do not want 
to make boys mere industrial machines. I want to fill their life and enable them to 
live their life fully, not only in their work, but in the other interests which pertain 
to their life. But I know as I look at these boys in that school that they are not all 
going to be paid £400 a year as members of Parliament. I know they are not all 
going to the university; I know that some of them are going to earn honest livings; 
and therefore I want to give them a real practical training, not to enable them to be 
talkers, for we have got quite enough talkers about, and we want more workers; that 
is the trouble. I want the standpoint of the local education authority to be: ‘“How 
can we give the best possible equipment for the future of their lives to these boys 
and girls in this school?” I do not want mere university professors to settle the 
whole of this question for us. I want the common sense of ordinary practical men. I 
have a great admiration for men of genius. We can not do without these dreamers. 
We can not do without these thinkers. We can not do without these idealists, but 
they lead us into terrible messes unless a few practical common-sense people keep 
their eye on them when they are passing acts of Parliament. And therefore it is 
necessary that we should have a sound and rational and intelligent education policy. 
Then you come to secondary schools, and I really think that in these we are making 
a terrible mess of it. That is my first opinion. You have got to consider the mate- 
rial you are working with, and you have to consider the number of years that a child 
has at your disposal. It is no good trying to put a quart into a pint pot, for it can 
not be successfully done, and I say you want to grade your syllabus to the possibili- 
ties of the children you have to deal with. Then, I want to see a great deal more 
done with these trade schools, for I believe the future of trade schools is of vital im- 
portance to the commercial interests of the country. And then to revert for a moment 
to the elementary school. I do not think myself it is at all a good thing to take a 
oright, intelligent boy, who is going to be an artisan ard can not stop at school longer 
than 15 or 16 years of age, from the elementary school and set him on a fresh kind of 
syllabus altogether. 
T should like to have good elementary schools of the higher-grade type to carry 
the boy on to the termination of his educational career.! 
Among the resolutions adopted at this meeting were the following: 
That the time has arrived when the strongest possible protest should be offered by 
the local education authorities to undertake any further financial obligations until the 
Government has redeemed its long promise of further financial aid. 
That in the opinion of this association the time has arrived when the regulations of 
the board of education governing higher elementary schools should be revised, and that 
the executive committee be instructed to submit a draft of suggested revision to the 
board of education for their consideration. 
That the present system of inspection of schools followed by the board of education 
is unsatisfactory, as it fails to consider the various grades of education taken together 
and in their relation to one another in a given area. 
Association of teachers in technical institutions—One of the most 
important annual gatherings in England is that of the Association 
of Teachers in Technical Institutions, which held its annual con- 
ference at Bradford May 12-14 of the current year. Founded in

  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 735 
London in 1904, the membership of the association had reached 700 
when the first conference was held two years later at Leeds. To-day 
it numbers 1,200 members. Great interest attaches to the present 
meeting, not only on account of the intrinsic importance of technical 
education, but of its relation to the plan for educational expansion 
which has been unfolded beforeParliament. The president of the asso- 
ciation, Mr. P. Coleman, of the Northern Polytechnic Institution, Lon- 
don, in his inaugural address dwelt particularly upon the need of 
“post elementary” education, freely open to the industrial classes of 
England. 
The substance of this address was reported in the Yorkshire 
Observer, from which the following citations are taken: 
In the last 10 years the percentage of those leaving the elementary school and pro- 
ceeding to the secondary or technical school had nearly doubled, but it was still below 
5percent. In London 35,000 boys left the elementary schools each year, of whom two- 
thirds drifted into unskilled occupations, with the probability of unemployment at 
the age of 18 or 19, and with no regular training during those years of employment. 
The trade schools for boys last session had 900 pupils, those for girls 700. In Munich 
and Berlin in the compulsory continuation schools for boys, the numbers studying 
with a view to skilled employment were 90 per cent and 65 per cent of the whole 
numbers. These schools involved an attendance for about 240 hours a year for the 
agesof14to17. We could notasa nation afford this continuous waste of good material. 
The president of the board ‘of education had already foreshadowed a large extension 
of the system of junior technical schools, an extension absolutely necessary if under 
modern conditions English industry is to continue to be carried on by skilled and 
intelligent labor. 
With regard to the curriculum for junior technical schools, Mr. 
Coleman continued that it must be the first object of the school to 
impart the habit of study and reading. The school, he said, would 
not succeed if its students were content to stop, at the point reached 
in a two-year course and had not opened their eyes to the great 
world of knowledge that lay all around and before them. While the 
foundation of the curriculum must be science and mathematics, 
with special reference to the future occupation, combined with these 
should be the study of English literature, history, and the principles 
of citizenship. Closing his address, the president said: 
We must look forward to a time when it shall be, if not impossible, at any rate 
exceptional, to enter one of our great industries without some definite specialized 
training—a training to be continued in the daytime to the end of the apprenticeship 
or learning period. If this ideal be realized, our evening technical courses should, 
asarule, be addressed to adult students who already possess a wide practical knowl- 
edge of their occupation and who are already accustomed to read and think for them- 
selves. Students of this kind demand the best that the teacher can give, and when 
our colleges are filled with such learners and teachers fitted to teach them, the future 
of technical education and of skilled industry in this country will be bright. 
The views presented by Mr. Coleman were strongly indorsed by 
subsequent speakers, including Mr. A. C. Coffin, director of education 
 
-P-A-G-E-790
736 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
for Great Britain; Mr. G. Fletcher, assistant secretary of the depart- 
ment of technical instruction in Ireland; and Prof. J. H. Reynolds, of 
the University of Manchester, president of the Association of Technical 
Instruction, who has spent the greater part of his active life in pro- 
moting the cause of technical training. Mr. Reynolds said ‘there 
can be no technology worth the name that is not built on science.” 
The business of the technical teacher is to show— 
the application of the deepest results of science to the needs of industry; without this, 
his nation can not remain at the head of the industrial nations of the world. 
A SWEEPING CRITICISM. 
The chief sensation of the year in educational circles in England 
was the indictment brought against the elementary schools by Dr. 
W. HI. D. Rouse, headmaster of the Perse grammar school, Cambridge. 
Dr. Rouse, it will be remembered, was at Teachers’ College, Columbia 
University, in the summer of 1912, and created great interest by his 
method of teaching Latin. He is a member of several learned societies 
and is one of the most eminent classical scholars of the day. 
The indictment of the elementary school was published in the 
Evening News of May 15 and 16, 1913 (London), the first installment 
appearing under the title, “The Problem Stated.” Its main points 
are summed up by that journal as follows: 
Large classes of the people were well educated a hundred years ago without being 
able to read or write. 
Life no longer educates the dwellers in cities. 
Sulture of the mind, control of the will, consideration for others’ rights are not 
taught in the elementary schools. 
Teachers drawn from these schools go all over the country and corrupt the local 
speech.* : 
The elementary system seems hardly to touch the character. It is all artificial. 
Learning in itself is not respected. 
There is no imagination in it, no enjoyment in the process. 
The second installment of the indictment is headed, “A Remedy: 
School Colonies.” The main points as summed up by the same 
journal are: 
Dingy room and asphalt playground must be superseded by school buildings in the 
country. 
Schools to be grouped in one large park for each district, with workshops and labora- 
tories. 
No distinction of social classes. 
School colonies would develop sense of comradeship and spirit of give and take. 
Cost might be covered by strikes avoided and decrease of pauperism and incom- 
petency. 
 
-P-A-G-E-791
    EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 137 
A STRONG DEFENSE. 
The indictment by Dr. Rouse called forth equally strong defenses 
of the schools as they are. Among them, one from Sir James Yoxall, 
who knows the schools thoroughly, having begun his career as an 
elementary school-teacher. At present he is a member of Parliament, 
general secretary of the National Teachers’ Association, and editor of 
the Schoolmaster, which is the tribune of the teachers in England. 
Mr. Yoxall drew attention to the fact that Dr. Rouse gives no proof 
of his actual knowledge of the conditions that he criticizes. In this 
respect his criticisms are like ‘accusations and fault findings which 
crop up now and again in newspapers and elsewhere from persons 
not: qualified to judge of the difficulties.” On the other hand, these 
views are opposed by officials, inspectors, parents, and scholars 
whose opinions are the result of experience and ‘a judicial habit of 
mind arising from opportunities for long and close observation of the 
subject.” 
With respect to the remedy proposed, Mr. Yoxall declared that Dr. 
Rouse belongs to the impossible class of critics and reformers who 
demand “‘a tabula rasa to begin with.’’ Even were they within the 
bounds of possibility, it would require, he says, ‘‘a school life of 15 
‘years, and of all of the day, seven days a week * * * to carry them 
out.” 
In proof of the steady development of the elementary schools and 
the effect they are producing upon the lives of their pupils, Mr. Yoxall 
said: 
Modifications and improvement are going on in the elementary school world—and 
ina very remarkable degree. Already it is fair to say (as the president of the board of 
education has recently stated), that the English elementary schools are second to none 
in the world, though they came into existence later than similar schools in any other 
first-class country. 
* * * * * * * 
li the elementary schools have hardly touched the character, how is it that the 
commonalty of to-day, who when boys and girls passed through the elementary schools, 
show such a marked improvement on what the commonalty used to be in most of the 
matters which arise from character? Not 5 per cent of the population have passed 
through secondary schools. Does Dr. Rouse suggest that of the adult population 85 
per cent (for 10 per cent at least must be allowed for as never having been in an ele- 
mentary or any school, or never having been there for any period worth mentioning) 
show—-to the observing, calm, and respectful eye of a person old enough to judge of 
what used to be, and sympathetic enough to judge of what now is—that the behavior, 
manners, habits, and intelligence of the commonalty have not improved? 
PATIENCE AND SYMPATIIY. 
The fact is, of course, that only very slowly and through many difficulties does a race 
or a nation—and above all the poorer class of a nation—emancipate, elevate, and ade- 
quately fit itself for the best things.

If he sympathetically knew the lives and work of elementary school-teachers, he 
would esteem and respect them, as people in general do; and if he were a philosopher 
at all he would know that mediocrity is the thing most likely to happen among great 
numbers of children or people, and that no educational system or variations in edu- 
cational systems can make us all geniuses. If his aversion to mediocrity means (and 
I seem to get glimpses of that in his articles) that all except the very brilliant are to be 
kept in lower positions, and that the educational system should be adapted to that 
end, I refuse to consider a Calvinistic system under which a certain number would be 
elected to receive educational advantages and the rest doomed irremediably to the 
opposite.!

NOTES ON HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The progress toward a national system of education in England has 
been marked by the foundation of provincial universities thoroughly 
imbued with the modern spirit, extending their provision without 
restriction to all classes of men and women, and drawing their sup- 
port largely from municipal funds and treasury grants. Oxford and 
Cambridge have not remained outside this movement, and are being 
drawn within the supervisory province of the Government through 
the acceptance of public grants for specific purposes; for the current 
year Oxford received for the department of engineering science a  
-P-A-G-E-794
  740 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
grant amounting to about $1,500, and additional sums for rural 
economy and forestry. Cambridge receives a grant for forestry 
amounting to $2,500 a year for three years, and from the Govern- 
ment’s Development Fund an additional $15,000 for buildings 
required for research and teaching in the school of rural economy. 
The trade-union and other associations of working men have lately 
demanded that the resources of Oxford and Cambridge should be 
turned more fully to the service of the mass of the people; but the 
proposition for a royal commission on the two universities has not 
been favorably received by the Government. Important reforms, 
however, are being accomplished in the universities by their own 
action. On the purely scholastic side special interest attaches to the 
abolition of religious tests, which formerly made the diplomas and 
the honors of these two foundations the exclusive privilege of mem- 
bers of the established church. The last vestige of such tests was 
swept away at Cambridge by the favorable action taken in February, 
1913, upon the proposal to abolish religious tests in the case of candi- 
dates for divinity degrees. Similar action was initiated at Oxford 
by the theologic professors themselves. The statutes to this effect 
proposed: (1) To abolish the requirement that examiners in the 
school of theology must be priests in the Church of England; (2) that 
the degrees of B. D. and D. D. should be open to any master of arts 
who has ‘shown a good general acquaintance with Christian the- 
ology.” The statutes were carried in congregation by large ma- 
jorities, but were rejected in convocation. The report of the royal 
commission on the University of London, which was completed dur- 
ing the current year, is encyclopedic in scope and detail, and irre- 
spective of its effect upon London, will long remain the source of 
information respecting modern university problems. It is inter- 
esting to note that the appointment committee, which was consti- 
tuted at Oxford in 1892, has recently secured special recognition, 
and a similar board has been constituted at Cambridge. These 
boards are now placing over 300 men a year from each university. 
The modern universities of England from their foundation gave 
great emphasis to applied science, and have had large development 
in respect to laboratory equipment and funds for research and in- 
struction relating to the industries of their respective regions; for 
instance, the University of Manchester has specialized in study and 
research in textile subjects, and the University of Leeds in those per- 
taining to the leather industries. 
Among the measures by which the older universities are meeting 
the demands for larger public service are the tutorial classes con- 
ducted under the combined. auspices of the universities and the 
Workers’ Educational Association. This work has proved so suc- 
cessful that the University of Oxford, at which the idea originated,
-P-A-G-E-795
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. TAL 
has just voted funds from the university chest for its maintenance. 
The enlarged plans for promoting relations between the older uni- 
versities and those of the colonial Provinces are an outcome of the 
imperial spirit, which was signally manifested by the congress of 
British universities held at London in 1912. 
Prominent among the subjects of discussion during the year is that 
of university provision for women. It is recalled that nearly half a 
century has elapsed since the Schools Inquiry Commission issued 
its report recommending among other reforms that of extending 
university facilities to women. These recommendations gave an 
immense impetus to the cause, which had already excited wide atten- 
tion. The outcome is seen in the establishment of special colleges 
for women at Oxford and Cambridge and the opening of all the recent 
university foundations to women on the same terms with men. The 
Jatest illustration of the vigor of the separate colleges for women was 
the opening on July 4 of the new buildings of Bedford College of the 
University of London. This institution dates from 1849 and is the 
oldest university college for women in England. The inauguration 
of the new buildings was attended with impressive ceremonies, and 
was graced by the presence of Queen Mary and a large company of 
representative men and women. 
SCOTLAND. 
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS. 
The year has been marked in Scotland by progress in respect to the 
new duties placed upon the local authorities by the education act of 
1908. These duties include the means of prolonging the training of 
children who must early enter upon industrial pursuits, the assistance 
of such pupils in the choice of employment, and provision for con- 
tinuing their training after they begin work. Along with this exten- 
sion of educational efforts, important welfare duties have been placed 
upon the school boards by the act of 1908. 
The purpose to bring every child under instruction is indicated by 
. the arrangements for conveying children in isolated districts to the 
nearest school, and in cases where the distances are extreme and the 
roads very bad, for lodging children in the neighborhood of an acces- 
sible school. The expenditure by school boards for this purpose has 
increased as follows: In 1910 it amounted to £874 ($4,370); in 1911, 
to £1,324 ($6,620), and in 1912 to £2,202’ ($11,010). 
Provision for extending the period of elementary education is made 
by supplementary and continuation classes, which are treated quite 
fully in the present chapter. With regard to measures for assisting 
 
-P-A-G-E-796
    742 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
parents and children in -the choice of employment for the latter, the 
school boards as a rule report that progress is slow. The welfare 
activities are in the main comprised under the general head of medical 
inspection, which is also considered in extenso in this chapter. 
SUPPLEMENTARY CLASSES. 
PURPOSE. 
The supplementary classes in the elementary schools, and the con- 
tinuation classes with which they are linked up, have been created to 
meet the needs of pupils of more than average ability, but who from 
the pressure of circumstances or their own inclinations are not likely 
to go on to secondary schools. In this provision the Scotch authori- 
ties have endeavored to guard the unity of their school system and to 
prevent the evils of too early specialization; consequently their policy 
in this respect is attracting very wide attention. The superintendent 
of education for Nova Scotia in his current report declares that the 
provision of supplementary classes after the Scotch model is emi- 
nently desirable for his own Province. He explains the purpose and 
method of this provision as follows: 
One of the most practical changes that could be carried out in the present common- 
school program would be that which has been in successful operation in Scotland for 
a number of years. This modification of the classes in the Grades VII and VIII is 
designated as the “supplementary classes.’’ The aim is to take the large proportion 
of boys and girls who will leave the public schools at the age of 14 and to thoroughly 
ground them in the rudiments of the common branches of knowledge that are nec- 
essary for every intelligent independent citizen. Besides this, the boys are given a 
lot of handwork in iron and wood in order to make them more proficient when they 
enter the apprenticeship period, and the girls are given a good deal of domestic 
economy so that they will learn the rudiments of efficient home making. The pro- 
cedure in connection with these classes is exceedingly simple. At the age of 12 the 
pupils are classified. The parents are consulted as to the future of the boys and 
girls, and the great majority who are sure that they will not attend after the age of 
14 are put in the above-mentioned classes. There is no attempt here at social strat- 
ification, no desire on the part of the educational authorities to keep the children of 
the poor in the occupations of poor parents, but merely a common-sense effort to 
make the children of more immediate practical value when they first start industrial 
life at the age of 14. 
It is believed by the Scotch authoritics that by the time pupils are 
12 years of age it is possible to forecast their future course sufficiently 
to justify the transfer of a certain class of pupils into the supple- 
mentary classes, and another class into secondary schools, while the 
remaining pupils keep on to the end of the elementary school course. 
The endeavor is made to so correlate the work of the different grades 
of schools as not to preclude a subsequent change of course for those 
who have made the first break at 12 years of age.

SCOPE. 
The official regulations comprise the following schedule of subjects 
common to all supplementary classes: * 
A— The study of English. 
The main object of this study shall be to create a taste for good literature. 
The chief means of carrying on this study should be: 
(1) Systematic home reading, with properly directed choice of books, 
(2) An efficient system of reviewing, explaining, and testing in school the reading 
done at home. 
(3) The committing to memory, after discussion and explanation, of suitable 
pieces of verse and of prose. 
(4) Systematic teaching and practice of English composition. 
B.— Certain studies bearing upon matters which it is of concern that all the pupils should 
know, whatever their occupations in after life are to be. 
Under this heading may be specified: 
(1) The Laws of Health. 
(2) Money Matters— Thrift, Investment, Insurance. 
(3) The Conditions of Trade and Employment. 
(4) The Institutions of Government under which we live. 
(5) The Empire—its history, growth, and trade; our Colonies and the openings 
for enterprise which they afford. 
(6) Nature Study, Drill, and Singing. 
Reference is made to their lordships’ circular letter No. 374 of February 16, 1903, 
for an explanation of the spirit in which they desire these studies to be pursued, and 
for certain suggestions as to method. 
At this stage of study it is highly desirable that full use should be made of the ord- 
nance survey map of the district in which the school is situated, both in connection 
with nature study and also for the purposes of specific lessons in geography. 
As stated in the circular, it is not considered imperative that all the topics mentioned 
under Head B (with the exception of (1) The Laws of Health) should be taken up with - 
the same set of pupils. 
Specimen schedules are also offered for the specialized courses, 
which are as follows: Commercial, industrial, course for rural schools, 
household management (for girls), and navigation.   
STATISTICS, 
From the latest official report it appears that— 
during the year ended August 31, 62,117 candidates were approved by the inspectors 
for enrollment in supplementary courses or in higher-grade departments, and during 
the same period the average attendance on which grant was claimed in 2,056 primary 
schools was 49,497, the latter number representing the scholars who have received 
instruction in supplementary course work, and on whose account grants have been 
allowed at advanced rates.” 
The merit certificate was instituted in 1899 to encourage attendance 
at school up to 12 years of age. According to regulations adopted in 
1903, candidates for this certificate must have pursued a supple- 
mentary course for at least one year. The total number of merit 
certificates awarded in 1912 was 18,489.

CONTINUATION CLASSES. 
ORGANIZATION. 
The code of regulations for continuation classes provides for four 
divisions of classes, as follows: 
I. Classes for the completion of general elementary education. 
II. Classes for specialized instruction. 
III. Courses for specialized instruction. 
IV. Auxiliary classes. 
The classes of the first division are open without restriction to any 
pupil who is free from the obligation to attend an elementary school. 
The managers of the classes are required to submit, for approval by 
the education department, a course of general instruction based upon 
the general course of the supplementary classes and other courses of 
a more specialized nature based upon corresponding courses in the 
supplementary classes. All the subjects of an approved course must 
as a rule be taken by all the pupils, the evident purpose being to dis- 
courage the pursuit of isolated subjects. 
The regulations require that a class shall meet on at least two 
separate days in each week for a session of 20 weeks, excepting under 
special conditions. The teachers in continuation classes must be 
persons above 18 years of age, whose qualifications are approved by 
the department. ‘ 
Division II comprises classes for the elementary instruction of 
pupils in such special subjects as may be of use to them in preparing 
for any particular trade, occupation, or profession; pupils must be 
over 16 years of age at the date of joining the class and give proof 
of fitness for the instruction. The different subjects provided for in 
this division are classified under the following heads: English sub- 
jects, which include English, geography, history, and the life and 
duties of the citizen; languages; commercial subjects; art; mathemat- 
ics, extending through geometry, algebra, and dynamics; science; 
applied mathematics and science; handwork; physical exercises; 
and first aid (including ambulance work). 
Division III comprises organized courses of systematic instruction 
arranged with a view to fitting students for the practice of particu- 
lar crafts, industries, or occupations. 
The division of auxiliary classes is largely intended to benefit 
teachers of special subjects required in the public schools. It includes 
classes of instruction in physical exercises, military drill, vocal music, 
wood-carving, fancy needlework, elocution in connection with an 
English course, etc. In respect to classes in all four of the divisions, 
it is required that only teachers be employed who give satisfactory 
proof of competency.
-P-A-G-E-799
  EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 745 
Grants are allowed in each division at fixed rates per pupil per 
hour a week, for a session of 20 weeks. The grants range as follows: 
Division I: 3s. 4d. to 4s. 2d. 
Division II: 4s. 2d. to 8s. 4d. 
Division III: 
(a) Commercial courses— 
10s. in the second year, 
15s. in the third year, and 
25s. in the fourth and succeeding years. 
(b) Industrial courses— 
18s. 4d. in the second year, 
20s. in the third year, and 
35s. in the fourth and succeeding years. 
Division IV: 2s. 6d. per capita. 
The classes in Groups II and III are directly preparatory to the 
central institutions, and every inducement is offered to promising 
pupils to complete their training in some one of these institutions.” 
STATISTICS, 
The statistics for 1911-12 pertaining to continuation classes 
show that 144,815 individual students were included for grant. 
A reference to the figures for 1901-2, the first year of the continu- 
ation class code, shows that the number of individual students then 
was 78,171; therefore, the number attending at the institution of 
the continuation class system in 1901 has now almost doubled itself. 
But although this points to much cause for satisfaction in the prog- 
ress generally made, regret is expressed in the official report that 
there is a want of initiative among a number of the rural school 
boards. This timidity is attributed in some cases to the fear of ex- - 
pense falling upon the rates. 
Attention is called to the increased grants offered for continuation 
classes in sparsely populated districts, and also to the fact that, 
when a rural school board is unable to assemble sufficient students _ 
to constitute a continuation class, provision is made by which pupils 
over 14 who have left the day school may attend at supplementary 
course work in the winter months, for probably two or three after- 
noons a week, and for these attendances special grants are awarded. 
It is contemplated that for these quasi-supplementary course pupils 
the work would be mainly practical and individual, with an amount 
of literary work sufficient to guide a student’s home reading and 
study. 
CONTINUATION CLASSES AT EDINBURGH. 
The total number of continuation classes in Scotland reported for 
the session 1912-13 was 567; of this number only 13 were situated in

746 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
the larger cities, which afford peculiar facilities for the conduct of 
such classes. In 1912 the organizer of these classes for Edinburgh 
visited the continuation trade schools of Germany, London, and 
Paris for the purpose of gaining suggestions for the improvement of 
the work under his charge. In his report of that tour, he says: 
From the voluntary systems of London and Paris, Edinburgh has little to learn, 
so far as continuation class work proper is concerned. In the matters of enrollment, 
regularity of attendance, coordination with technical colleges, use of employment 
bureaus, and advisory committees, Edinburgh is distinctly in advance; but the 
equipment of the preapprenticeship and apprenticeship schools of London and 
Paris is more complete in many respects than what is provided in our trade classes. 
When the comprehensive arrangements of the German towns are compared with 
ours, a somewhat different tale has to be told. For example, the system of Munich 
is superior in the following respects, viz: (1) All young persons between 14 and 17 
are under instruction; (2) they attend school for a definite number of hours per week— 
nine hours for boys and six for girls; (3) they are taught at a time of the day when 
both pupils and teachers are comparatively fresh; (4) they receive a general as well 
as a vocational training; (5) the teachers, as a rule, are not engaged in primary school 
work, but they have been specially trained; (6) facilities for workshop practice are 
more abundant, and buildings are provided separate from the primary schools; (7) 
drawing is an essential subject in every course; (8) special courses are organized for 
journeymen, and for the temporarily unemployed; (9) instruction is given in the 
history of the various trades, and in the knowledge of trade materials; (10) all the 
teaching is made to bear directly upon citizenship as well as upon trade efficiency. 
On the other hand, it may be claimed for Edinburgh that the workshop accommo- 
dation now being provided is quite as suitable for the purpose as the more elaborate 
buildings in Munich, is much cheaper, and more akin to real workshops in appearance; 
that the practical work in the trade classes, so far as it goes, is quite as good, and 
that more systematic efforts are made to guide boys and girls into suitable occupations. 
To our coordination with technical and art colleges there is no counterpart in 
Germany.' 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
GOVERNMENT MEASURES. 
Secondary education in Scotland is the work of private and en- 
dowed schools or of municipal (burgh) schools, which are managed 
by boards distinct from those responsible for elementary education. 
By a series of measures extending over a period of nearly two decades 
the Scotch education department has been gradually bringing the 
secondary schools under Government supervision. In 1883 the 
department established a leaving certificate for students who, on 
the completion of a course of secondary study, should pass the cer- 
tificate examination; subsequently an intermediate certificate was 
also offered. In 1885 the education department arranged for the 
inspector of secondary schools applying for the service.

EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. TAT 
PRESENT STATE. 
The means and the importance of prolonging the school period 
for the great body of children have been prominent subjects of 
discussion in educational journals and meetings during the current 
year. In the debate in the House of Commons on the Scottish 
budget for 1913-14, the secretary for Scotland voiced the general 
sentiment of the people on this subject in his response to inquiries 
and criticisms that had arisen in the course of the debate. The 
secretary said in part: 
My honorable friend the member for East Edinburgh (Mr. J. M. Hogge) expressed 
the desire that I might have made a general statement in regard to education at the 
beginning of the debate. He pointed out there has been a great change in the methods 
of Scottish education within the last 10 years. That is perfectly true. There has 
been a great change and a very important change. The old interest of Scotland in 
higher education has not diminished, but has increased, and the status of higher educa- 
tion in Scotland has been greatly raised. * * * 
I should like to say that my position in regard to secondary education in Scotland 
is simply this: I recognize that it is necessary to maintain the system which has 
grown up during the last 10 years. There is no doubt that there was a strong need 
for improvement in the status of secondary education in Scotland 20 years ago. The 
university standard was too low, and therefore the standard in the secondary school 
was too low. Persons were taken into the universities at an earlier age, and they had 
frequently to attend elementary classes quite out of place in a university. I am not 
going over these well-known facts, but what I want to say is, it would be a great 
blunder if we were to go back on the advance that has been made in secondary educa- 
tion. Perhaps I can give some idea of it by asimple comparison. In 1899 there were 
about 30 secondary or higher schools in Scotland. There are now 250, and honorable 
members must remember that when we are talking about the difficulties of travel 
and of the children being away from home, how much greater was that difficulty 13 
or 14 years ago, because you have these 250 schools spread all over Scotland. There 
is another point I want to make. I do not think any educationist will deny that it 
is better for individual pupils, if practicable, that they should receive this higher 
instruction in secondary schools, where the whole atmosphere is appropriate to such 
a school and where the teachers are of a certain standard, than that they should 
receive it in a primary school. At the same time, one knows there are difficulties— 
difficulties of distance and of money, and that it is very desirable you should give 
all the opportunities you can to higher instruction in the primary schools, but not to 
take the place of the secondary school where it is practicable to send the child to such 
a secondary school. The better secondary education is given in a proper secondary 
school; the other is a substitute. It is perfectly obvious where the child is getting 
education from a teacher in a primary school that it can not have the same effect as if 
it was received in a properly equipped higher secondary school. 
It is quite a mistake to think we do not desire to see primary schools feeding those 
secondary schools. There are now in Scotland several hundred primary rural schools 
sending children to secondary schools equipped to enter upon the intermediate course 
in the second and even in some cases in the third year of that course. The scientific 
apparatus necessary and referred to by my honorable friend, the member for East Edin- 
burgh, is not a very serious matter. A very few pounds will provide all the scientific 
apparatus which is necessary for the purpose of intermediate education. Of course 
the real difficulty is this, not that there are not enough scientifically equipped teachers 
or enough teachers with university degrees to supply all the schools, or enough turned
-P-A-G-E-802
  748 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
out of the universities to supply the vacancies, but the difficulty is that the small 
school boards can not afford to give the salaries or other inducements that will attract 
the equipped university graduate to that school. That is the real difficulty, but 1 
want to make it perfectly clear that we are anxious to do all we can to encourage 
higher instruction in rural primary schools. * * * 
Before I leave the question of secondary education I should like to mention a fact 
which I think is extremely interesting. I have said there are hundreds of schools 
which are giving higher instruction at the present moment, and that they were multi- 
plied by more than eight times the number of primary schools in Scotland since 1899. 
I am glad to say in the matter of secondary education now the proportion of pupils 
who go from the elementary schools to the higher schools show figures of which we 
need not be ashamed. The proportion of children in Scotland going on to the real 
course of higher instruction is as 1 to 6.5, whereas in England it is 1 to 22; so I think 
that figure is a very satisfactory one, and when we are criticizing higher education in 
Scotland it is one to be borne in mind. There is one other point in connection with 
that subject. The difficulty of finding lodgings when children come from rural dis- 
tricts at considerable distances to the towns where the secondary school is situated. 
That is a real difficulty, and also where they have to come a considerable distance by 
train. I donot altogether sympathize, but to a large extent I do agree, with the hon- 
orable member for Glasgow University, in thinking that it is not quite worthy of 
the modern race of Scotsmen to make such fuss of a few miles on a bicycle when their 
grandfathers would have walked as many miles to obtain a much inferior education. 
But we ace very anxious to meet all the real cases, and the experiment which is being 
tried to provide hostels for secondary students is one which I hope the school boards 
_ may take up and extend." 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS, 
During the present year the first report on medical school inspec- 
tion in Scotland was issued. It derives special importance from the 
fact that it was prepared by W. Leslie Mackenzie, M. D., the medical 
member. of the local government board for Scotland, widely known 
for his works on the health of school children and kindred subjects 
| pertaining to public hygiene. 
The report presents an interesting survey of the measures that led 
to this service throughout the Kingdom. It is an unexpected result 
of a royal commission on physical training in Scotland, appointed in 
1902 to inquire into the apparent physical deterioration of the com- 
mon people; at the same time there was no reference to the health 
of children, as is indicated by the fact that the commission had only 
one medical member. In the progress of its investigations the com- 
mission discovered that data as to the physique of school children 
were almost entirely lacking in Britain. Accordingly, a medical 
investigation into a selected number of Scottish school children was 
ordered, the results of which are summed up by Dr. Mackenzie as 
follows: 
The facts elicited by the investigation were so striking that, for a time, they were 
regarded as gross exaggerations; but, both in England and in Scotland, they have 
been more than confirmed by later investigations now proceeding everywhere.

-P-A-G-E-803
EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 749 
It is, however, worth recording that one of the investigators concluded his report as 
follows: 
On the basis of these facts and inferences, I have formed the following general 
conclusions: 
First. The large number of serious and minor diseases directly and indirectly 
affecting physical efficiency and mental efficiency constitutes an overwhelming case 
for a medical inspection of school children. 
Second. The facts as to physical exercise at the various schools (four in Edinburgh, 
150 children from each; two in poor quarters, one in a fairly good quarter, one in a 
good artisan or shopkeeper quarter) demonstrated that a primary condition of any 
good result from increased physical training is adequate food and adequate clothing. 
Third. No systematic exercise ought to be practiced or enforced without a prelim- 
inary medical examination of the vital organs to insure that irreparable damage shall

Fourth. That exercises should be organized—not as at present according to the 
code standard in which the child is situated but—strictly in accordance with health, 
physical development, and vigor." 
The commission recommended that— 
School boards should have the command of medical advice and assistance in the 
supervision of schools; a systematic record of physical and health statistics should 
be kept; and a small number of medical and sanitary experts should be added to the 
inspecting staff under the education department. 
It is worthy of note that England was the first to secure the law 
providing for the service recomancnded by this Scotch commission. 
Scotland had to wait until 1908 before legislation could be carried 
through to give effect to their recommendations. The education 
act for that year provided that— 
A school board may, and where required by the department shall, provide for the 
medical examination and supervision of the pupils attending schools within their 
district to such an extent and subject to such requirements as may from time to time 
be prescribed by any code or minute of the department, and, for the purposes of this 
section, the school board may employ medical officers or nurses or arrange with vol- 
untary agencies for the supply of nurses, and provide appliances or other requisites. 
(Education Act, sec. 4.) 
The department of education and the local education authorities 
proceeded at once to carry this provision into effect. The first 
general report of the service, issued after the lapse of four years, is 
devoted chiefly to the history and organization of the movement, 
the sanitation of the schools, the personal hygiene of the children, 
and the general results in town and county. The author of the 
report says: 
I have deliberately refrained, meanwhile, from any discussion of statistical mate- 
rials which, though very important, are not yet by themselves sufficient to form the 
groundwork of general conclusions. In short, the aim has been to indicate not so 
much what is of scientific interest as what is capable of immediate remedy. 
The education department, following the policies already adopted 
in England, advises that the county area be made the unit for the 
1 First report on the medical inspection of school children in Scotland, 1913, pp. 4-5.

    750 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
work of medical inspection, exception being made in the case of a 
few burghs which, like- Dunfermline, had previously made ample 
provision for the medical service. Detailed instructions for a county 
system are issued by the department, and the report before us 
includes the scheme of the Fife County committee, which has been 
approved by the department. The department also has issued 
a memorandum on the medical examination and supervision of 
school children, giving detailed instructions as to the conduct of 
this service, a copy of which memorandum is also included in the 
report. The clause of the education act cited above confers on the 
department of education a reserve of compulsion which may be 
brought into play where it appears that a local authority is neglectful _ 
of its duty in this respect. It is noted with great satisfaction in 
the report that it has not been necessary to exercise such compulsion 
except in one or two instances. The county education committees 
and the school boards have as a rule proceeded with the greatest good 
will to establish schemes of medical inspection through the length and 
breadth of Scotland. There are, it is true, one or two island authori- 
ties still to complete their schemes; but the delay is due purely 
to geographical difficulties. Within less than three years from 
the commencement of the act, complete systems of medical inspec- 
tion have been established, with the assent and cooperation both 
of the health and of the school authorities concerned. 
THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SCOTLAND. 
The Educational Institute of Scotland is one of the oldest and most 
important associations of the kind in the world. For the first time 
in its history, since its foundation in 1847, a woman was selected 
by a very large majority, from four candidates, for sole nomination 
to the annual general meeting, as president of the educational insti- 
tute for the year 1913-14. The honor fell to Miss Elizabeth Fish, 
LL, A., and she was formally installed in the office on the occasion 
of the annual meeting in September. This event gives occasion 
for some pertinent comments in the Educational News, which are 
here cited: 
Prior to the passing of the great education act of 1872 women teachers were prac- 
tically unknown in Scottish schools. But a change began in 1873, a change which is 
still in process, the end of which no one can foresee. Few in number during the 
“seventies,’’ and comparatively few in the “‘eighties,’’ women have “‘come into their 
own” during the last 20 years to such a degree that in our schools they now outnumber 
the men by six to one. But in this development Scotland lags notoriously behind 
America, where, as regards both Canada and the United States, the schools are almost 
exclusively ‘“‘manned” by women. 
As we are convinced that the school best fulfills its complex purposes which is, 
most nearly a replica of the home, we believe that there is in the school, as in the home, 
room for both the paternal and the maternal elements, and it will not be a good day
-P-A-G-E-805
     EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. 751 
for Scotland which finds men banished from the work of both primary and secondary 
education. Granting proper and reasonable inducements, such a break from the great 
traditions of the past need never be. Nor is there room for the suggestion that there 
is a necessary element of antagonism in the matter. As Miss Fish has wisely said, 
there is no profession other than teaching in which men and women work side by side 
so harmoniously and with a view to the common good as in the teaching profession. 
Long may this wholly satisfactory relationship continue. In the school and in the 
profession men’s problems are women’s problems; neither group can be solved sepa- 
rately; both may reach solution through, as hitherto, concurrent action. For example, 
the shameful salaries paid to somany women teachers in rural and in some provincial _ 
town schools will not be raised to a fairly reasonable amount without the help of 
men teachers and of that great organization which was founded by men and up to the 
present time has so largely been guided by men. At the same time very valuable 
work has in recent years been done by the women members of the council—a band 
relatively few in numbers, but strong in influence. This influence can not but be 
enhanced by the advent of a woman president. We predict for Miss Fish and for the 
institute a useful and successful year’s work, and we are confident that not only the 
members of council, but every member of the institute will rally to support the first 
woman occupant of the presidential chair.!

      EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 
PROPOSED LEGISLATION. 
Treland has been in an educational ferment throughout the year, 
resulting directly from opposition on the part of the Roman Catholic 
bishops to the measures proposed by Mr. Birrell, chief secretary for 
Ireland, for improving the secondary and primary schools. These 
measures provided for increase of the national grants for both classes 
of schools named, having special reference to necessities recognized 
alike by Catholics and Protestants throughout Ireland. The bills 
were, however, weighted with conditions that were indignantly 
rejected by the Catholic authorities as an insidious attempt to break 
down the system of education in which they believe, and for which 
they have made great efforts and sacrifices. 
In the face of the intense opposition excited by these measures the 
proposal for increased grants for the elementary schools was dropped; 
but a modified bill pertaining to the intermediate schools was passed 
at the close of the Parliamentary session. This bill, as explained by 
Mr. Birrell, chief secretary for Ireland, was unopposed and made no 
request for money. It simply provided that pupils between the 
ages of 8 and 14 in schools seeking relations with the intermediate 
 
-P-A-G-E-807
  EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 109 
education board should be relieved from examination, inspection of 
their work, and of the adaptation of the school to children of that 
age being substituted therefor. 
EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. 
In order to understand the bearing of the legislative measures 
referred to and the summarized statistics given below, it is necessary 
to have in mind certain features of educational administration in 
Ireland. The State-aided elementary schools are under the com- 
missioners of national education. This body comprises 20 mem- 
bers, of whom 10 must be Roman Catholics and 10 Protestants. 
The only salaried member is the resident commissioner, whose office 
is at Dublin. He is the executive head of the system. 
Secondary education is fostered by the intermediate education 
board, which conducts examinations for pupils from these schools 
and distributes grants to the managers of the same based upon the 
results of the examination. The annual income of the intermediate 
education board is made up of the interest on a Government fund 
of £1,000,000, and a sum from the Irish share of the customs and 
excise duties, which averages about £50,000 annually. Technical 
instruction in Ireland is controlled by the department of agriculture 
and technical instruction, which has an advisory board of technical 
instruction. The income of the department consists of an annual 
appropriation of £166,000 and the interest on an original endow- 
ment of £205,000, together with such additional appropriations as 
may be allowed from time to time. 
NATIONAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The support of the elementary schools is derived from Govern- 
ment and local funds. The schools may be denominational, that is 
Roman Catholic or Protestant, or mixed in respect to religion. The 
rights of parents are strictly guarded by a conscience clause in the 
school regulations, which provides that no child be allowed to attend 
a religious exercise of a denomination other than his own except upon 
written request of the parent. 
Grants are allowed by the commissioners in aid of the building of 
schoolhouses, but must not exceed two-thirds. of the estimated cost 
of the proposed structure except in needy districts. The Govern- 
ment pays the larger proportion of the salaries of teachers, requiring, 
however, a minimum addition from local funds of £12 ($60) for each 
teacher. Altogether the Government bears 94 per cent of the annual 
expenditure for the elementary schools. 
To avoid religious complications the department provides the textbooks for secular 
branches, which are issued at a small cost to the pupils.

  154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
For purposes of Government supervision the country is divided into 60 districts, 
which are grouped in 6 divisions, each in charge of a head inspector. Under these 
are 29 district inspectors, 7 unassigned inspectors, and 14 inspectors’ assistants, and 1 
inspector of drawing. Inspectors and their assistants are appointed upon examina- 
tion testing their scholastic and professional qualifications. 
Local civil authorities have no control over the schools. The local managers of 
schools, who are generally clergymen, come into direct relation with the board of 
commissioners. They appoint and dismiss teachers and arrange the details of the 
school work. Of a total of 3,061 managers in 1911, 2,497 were clerical. 
Under the compulsory school law of 1892 school districts may 
appoint attendance committees. This action has been taken by 231 
districts, of which number 228 have been very active in enforcing the 
law. In 1911 there were 39 towns and 113 rural districts without 
school-attendance committees. For the purpose of encouraging 
school attendance the commissioners have recently issued a military 
certificate which may be secured by any pupil over 13 years of age 
who has been enrolled in the seventh standard for one year, and who 
in the opinion of the inspector has attained fair proficiency in lan- 
guage, arithmetic, and geography. 
The commissioners have direct control of a special class of schools called ‘‘model 
schools,’’ for which they provide the buildings, These schools, as their name indi- 
cates, are intended to afford models of the best methods of instruction and organiza- 
tion, and to serve as practice schools for students in training colleges or normal schools: 
They numbered 30 in 1911, with an enrollment of 9,051 day pupils, included in the 
enrollment given in the table below. 
PROGRESS. 
Notwithstanding the widespread disaffection with present condi- 
tions, the year has afforded proofs of continued progress in the 
national schools. The average enrollment of pupils for the last year 
reported (ending Dec. 31, 1911) was 707,280, an increase of 
9 per cent above that of the previous year; although this is not a 
large increase, it shows recovery from a decline of attendance that 
took place between 1909 and 1910. The average daily attendance 
maintained was 72.5 per cent, as against 70.8 per cent the year 
before, and the highest thus far recorded. The improvement in 
enrollment and attendance is attributed by the commissioners to the 
increased number of well-built and well-equipped schools, the greater 
qualifications and efficiency of teachers, and the increasing pros- 
perity of the people. Through the consolidation of schools, the total 
number in operation declined from 8,720 in 1903 to 8,289 in 1911, 
but in the latter year there were 30,000 more pupils in attendance, 
notwithstanding the loss of over 400 small schools. Care is taken to 
preserve the rights of the teachers whose schools are discontinued 
by recognizing them on privileged conditions in the combined schools. 
The commissioners express regret at the proposal to cease the grants 
for building and improving schools, and they have addressed a press-

ing application to the treasury for the continuation of funds to be 
used at least in urgent cases. This is done under the conviction 
that the miserable and dilapidated condition of many of the schools 
has been the cause of unsatisfactory attendance as well as of in- 
difference to the system.

EXPENDITURE ON SCHOOLS AND TEACHING STAFFS. 
According to the report of the commissioners for the year ending 
December 31, 1911, the aggregate annual expenditure on the schools 
from all sources, including Parliamentary grant, school fees, and 
local subscriptions, amounted to £1,668,424 4s. 8d., as shown in the 
following table. This would give an average of £3 5s. 7d. for each 
child in average daily attendance during the year.

IRISH TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION ASSOCIATION.* 
The twelfth annual congress of the Irish Technical Instruction 
Association was held at Bangor, Down County, May 28-30 of the 
current year. The proceedings were animated by the consciousness 
of important achievements, and detailed accounts of the progress in 
technical instruction in different communities formed an important 
feature of the program. Down County itself may be taken to illus- 
trate what is going on in every part of the island. With respect to 
this area the chairman of the county council said: 
In 1905 we commenced a modest scheme of technical instruction with one domestic 
economy instructress and one manual instructor. I am pleased to tell you that we 
now have three domestic economy instructresses and two manual instructors, and in 
November last a technical school was opened in Downpatrick; pupils on the rolls 
number 240. The school has done well; the attendance has kept up, and everything 
with regard to it looks prosperous. For the ensuing session we will have a joint 
technical scheme working in County Down, consisting of all the rural districts, and 
also technical schools in connection with Donaghadee, Newcastle, and Warrenpoint. 
We began with an outlay on our modest scheme in 1904 of only £400; but it has worked 
up. The cost we anticipate for the current year will be £2,345. There are eight

suburban districts in County Down, and each of them will soon have a separate tech- 
nical instruction scheme at its disposal. Since we commenced operations eight years 
ago 3,000 persons have taken advantage of the schemes which we were enabled to 
offer them, and have passed through different methods of obtaining technical instruc- 
tion. Our estimate for the current year will be no less than about 7,000, which 
includes the agricultural and live-stock schemes. On the agricultural side we have 
allocated scholarships for the special education of the sons of farmers at a cost of £300 
per year. If I remember aright, we have all the schemes of the department now in 
force, and, speaking of the department, we are not without gratitude in County Down. 
We recognize, and are happy to have an opportunity of doing so publicly, that but 
for the assistance of the department, technical instruction here, as in the greater part 
of Ireland, would probably be unknown. The department assists us with rather 
more than half our outlay, and that enables us to put the complete schemes of which 
I have spoken into force. 
Eloquent tribute was paid to Sir Thomas Plunkett as the prime 
mover in that industrial transformation which has fixed the atten- 
tion of all nations upon Ireland. 
One of the most important subjects before the association was that 
of cooperation between county authorities and those of county bor- 
oughs and urban districts within the counties which have independent 
control of their own funds for technical instruction. Naturally, it is 
in the populous urban centers that well-equipped technical schools 
are established, and the rural districts within a county must either 
have access to these town schools or depend upon smaller schools and 
itinerant teachers for technical instruction. This matter was urged 
upon the attention of the congress by the vice chairman of the Cork 
County borough technical instruction committee, who introduced the 
subject as follows: 
Since the passing of the technical acts of 1889-1891 and the agricultural and tech- 
nical act of 1899 great developments have taken place. The most marked of all, I 
think, has been the erection of the splendid buildings in the six county boroughs, 
and also the new buildings in most of the larger towns, the result of which has been 
to enable these centers to provide much more thorough courses of instruction than 
could be got in small places, and the consequent desirability of extending their 
advantages as widely as possible. It must be remembered that developments are 
constantly in progress in the world of industry. Industries are every day becoming 
more complex and more specialized. If our technical schools are to fully meet the 
need of instruction, they must adapt their curricula and teaching in accordance with 
these developments. The cost of adequate staffing and equipment makes it impossible 
for small schools to do this work. 
With respect to the relation of these schools to the surrounding 
country, the speaker continued: 
It must be admitted on all hands that the town technical schools are the natural 
centers of instruction for the rural districts immediately surrounding them, and with- 
out these schools the county authorities would be compelled to either leave their 
young people uneducated or provide schools for them at great expense. It would, 
therefore, be reasonable and equitable that the county authorities should be willing 
to contribute a capitation fee, to, inasmall way, pay their share toward the erection, 
equipment, and maintenance of the schools they use conjointly with the borough or 
 
-P-A-G-E-812
  758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
urban students, and also assist their students to aftend by a small grant in aid of 
of traveling expenses, where such are incurred. I may add that such cooperation is 
a very common thing in England and Scotland, where county authorities contribute, 
as a matter of course, toward the education of pupils living in their areas, in technical 
schools situated in the larger areas of population, and it is not unknown in Ireland. 
Tt would seem reasonable that county authorities in Ireland should generally adopt 
a similar course for the boys of the rural districts surrounding a county borough or 
urban technical school. Such a course would remove one of the disabilities attach- 
ing to life in a rural district, and would tend in some measure to prevent the regret- 
table migration from the countryside to the town. 
The bright boys in the country are at present handicapped in comparison with 
town boys in the absence of means of technical education, and in this connection I 
would urge the earnest consideration of county authorities to the advantages of the 
scholarship scheme already in existence and which is in operation in a number of 
counties. The more general adoption of this scheme would further tend to remove 
the disabilities referred to and enable the technical schools to extend their sphere 
of usefulness. 
This paper brought out lively discussion, in which the position taken 
by the representative of Cork County was generally upheld, although 
the value of local classes and even the itinerant teachers for certain 
forms of industry was also insisted upon. The assistant secretary of 
the department of agriculture and technical instruction, while ex- 
pressing the greatest admiration for the work that is done in rural 
areas by itinerant instructors in manual work and domestic economy, 
ete., recognizes fully the limitation of such a method of education. 
In this connection he said: 
I ask you what are we going to do in the case of the bright boy in the country— 
magnificent material comes from the rural areas—what are we going to do for him? 
Are we going to make it impossible that he should compete in the same field with 
his brother in the large urban center? I think it would be a grave injustice. Where 
we find a boy of that kind, we ought to give him the chance of getting instruction 
in some center where technical education is efficiently carried on, and we have this 
in the large centers of population. Surely it is a question for the broad and generous 
consideration of county authorities. If they wish to do this for the brighter of their 
students, it can only be done in the large technical schools of the country. It has 
been urged, “ Let these authorities do it; it costs them nothing!” But that is entirely 
inaccurate. It does cost them something; it must cost them something. It is nota 
very large sum, and it would be perfectly easy to arrive at an estimate of the amount 
it costs them per head. It seems to me that if any such assistance were given, it. 
should be done on a basis such as this. A school can readily find out precisely what 
its education costs per head and what it costs per head out of the rates. Surely a 
contribution on a basis of the cost out of the rates on the students from rural areas 
is a perfectly fair basis. I happen to know it is the method adopted in parts of 
England and Scotland, and it is not altogether unknown in Ireland; and I am pleased 
to say that one of the first areas to carry this out was the rural district of Ballymoney. 
For the last six or seven years the rural district of Ballymoney has joined with the 
urban center and has struck a rate. I think it is just a matter for the sympathetic 
and broad consideration of county areas. I don’t think one could ask county coun- 
cils to do this unless it were in their own interests and for the interests of their work. 
I should like to see a movement in the direction indicated, supplemented by a gen- 
erous system of scholarships. I should like to see opportunities given to the bright 
boy from the rural areas.

  EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 759 
Technical instruction in relation to industries was the subject of a 
paper by Canon Arthur Ryan, of Tipperary, who emphasized the fact 
that what was needed in Ireland was not so much industries as indus- 
try. The great purpose of the association, in his judgment, was that 
of fostering in the rising generation of Irish men and women the spirit 
of industry, so that ‘‘with alert minds and skilled hands they may 
see and lay hold on the industrial opportunities that lie before them 
in the land of their birth.” In regard to the evidences of a real 
increase of material prosperity in Ireland as a result largely of the 
technical instruction act, Canon Ryan gave the following information: 
It is important to understand what the actual powers of the department are in 
regard to industry, and it appears that while they have large powers in regard to 
technical education and great freedom in regard to home industries, they have no 
power directly to finance an industry as such. They can educate and train our 
workers in the scientific and artistic principles underlying industries, but they-can 
not subsidize the industry itself. They must not spoon-feed our industries—they 
may supply the food, but they must not use the spoon. It is of course quite other- 
wise in regard to agriculture, which, not being hampered so much by trade rivalries, 
is free to receive direct and often liberal subsidies from the funds of the department. 
In regard to industries the department freely use such restricted powers as they 
have, and one of their first and most successful efforts was to encourage by means of 
grants the numerous home industries classes in the country. All over Ireland classes 
in lace, crochet-making, drawn-thread work, embroidery, hemstitching, sprigging, 
knitting, and other industries have been assisted, and are still assisted, by grants 
given with a view of improving the character of the products of these industries, 
which yield a very important supplementary income to many families in rural areas. 
But home industries have a very difficult struggle as against the product of the ma- 
chine, which has persistently invaded the domain of the cottage industry. In that 
struggle our sympathies may go, as mine certainly go, with the human being against 
the machine and the cottage against factory, with the modest competence of the 
many against the piled-up fortunes of the few; but it would have been criminal folly 
to ignore the part that machinery was destined to play in modern industries, and 
hence efforts were made to direct technical education in very clos connection with 
industries already in existence in Ireland or industries which might be introduced 
with promise of success. 
Among these it is encouraging to note the steady growth of the woolen industry, 
and the establishment of such mills as those at Galway and Kilkenny. Again, a most 
valuable illustration of the way in which technical instruction leads up to industries 
is to be found in the Kilkenny woodworkers’ industry, which took its origin in the 
manual instruction classes held in the rural districts of the county of Kilkenny. A 
still more interesting example is the introduction of machine embroidery, an industry 
which has been carried on for so many years in Switzerland. For the last quarter of 
a century large quantities of Irish linen have been sent to Switzerland to be embroid- 
ered, and returned to Ireland. In this connection two schools have been recently 
established in Ballydougan, near Gilford, in county Down, and at Maghera in county 
‘Derry. These schools are aided by liberal grants made by the department in order 
to provide training for workers in this machine-embroidery industry, which must be 
regarded as a new one in this country, and it would seem that excellent progress has 
been made. The revival of the shipbuilding industry in Derry, which I had an op- 
portunity of seeing at the last industrial congress there, gives promise that in this 
great and important field of enterprise the city on the Foyle may some day become a  
-P-A-G-E-814
    760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
rival of the city on the Lagan. The opening to-day at Balmoral of an exhibition of 
materialsand manufactures relating to the dressed-meat trade is another event of the 
first industrial importance. There will be shown more than 30 distinct products of 
the scientific handling of offal. The tanning industry alone holds almost incalculable 
possibilities. And the mere fact that we import every year boots and shoes to the 
value of nearly two million sterling should set us thinking, seeing that we export 
yearly hides enough to make all these boots and shoes at home. Time would not per- 
mit of the mention of the large number of small industries which have been developed 
owing, in great part, to local technical training and the habits of industry resulting 
from it; industries which do not quench the spirits of the young or leave them 
wrecked in health, but which afford wholesome and artistic and fairly lucrative em- 
ployment to thousands of Irish workers. We have the carpet-making factories at 
Killybegs and elsewhere, established by the congested districts board, and later the 
now flourishing carpet factories at Naas and Abbyleix; while there are the artistic, 
if smaller, ventures of the Dun Emer Guild, due to the tireless efforts of Miss Evelyn 
Gleeson; the stained-glass works of Miss Purser in Dublin, the metal-work industry at 
Fivemiletown, and a large number of others. Of one industry I can speak from close © 
personal knowledge—that of glove making in the town of Tipperary and its neighbor- 
hood. Of course, this is still a young industry, and Tipperary is a town of less than 
7,000 inhabitants; yet it isa great thing for us to have some 70 girls employed in healthy 
and cheerful surroundings, more than 40 of them doing the firm’s work in their own 
homes, and earning wages which, if not high at first, are sufficient for their support, 
and are raised according as their proficiency increases. Some six boys are appren- 
ticed to the master cutters, and although the skins used are not yet procurable in 
Treland, the thread supplied by Messrs. Fownes is all of Irish manufacture. From 
the cutting out of the skins to the final finishing of the glove all is done in Tipperary, 
and last year over 70,000 pairs of these Tipperary gloves were turned out, or about 
£12,000 worth. I rejoice to add that the cottages in which much of this work is done 
are the cleaner and the tidier for it; the girls are deeply interested in their work, and 
not a single tall chimney has been added to blur the view of the Galtee Mountains. 
Afew days ago some visitors to Tipperary saw not far from the town, and seated ona 
primrose bank, a merry group of girls, working away at their piles of gloves—indus- 
trialism al fresco! I may sum up this section of my paper by saying that the effect 
of all this constructive effort has been an increase in material prosperity, and statistics 
show a great increase in exports of agricultural produce and of manufactured articles. 
One of the consequences of these activities has been the establishment of the various 
industrial development associations, which have done so much good work in protect- 
ing Irish industries from fraud, and in directing the attention of the Irish people to 
the excellence of Irish products. In particular one may point to the establishment 
of the Irish trade-mark and to the very active campaign carried on by the Irish Indus- 
trial Development Association against the fraudulent sales of foreign products under 
the guise of Irish manufacture. We need not shut our eyes to the compliment implied 
in this dishonest imitation (what Irishman ever shut his eyes to a compliment?), but 
our vanity should not make us forget our purses. S 
Mr. Fletcher, the assistant secretary of the department of agri- 
culture and technical instruction, dwelt upon the importance of 
education in the domestic arts. He urged two reforms in the present 
system of education. : 
First, training for home duties to form part of the education of 
every girl. Under this head should be included the laws of health, 
home nursing, and first aid to the injured. Mr. Fletcher noted that 
the department has already introduced systematic teaching of this
-P-A-G-E-815
  
EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 761 
character into its training school, and has also for some years past 
held summer courses for the supplementary training of teachers at 
work. 
Second, the cultivation of thrift. Under this head he included 
detailed study of income and expenditure, since the frequent failure 
to adjust the two to each other arises “not from the intention to 
overspend, but from the neglect to keep any sort of accounts, and 
this inefficiency characterizes many of the well to do, no less than 
the working classes.”’ 
The following problem was suggested for the course in thrift: 
Given the household of an artisan living in an urban center in Ireland, consisting of 
father, mother, and two children (over the age of 10), and with a total income not 
exceeding 30 shillings per week.—To prepare for a year a detailed family budget 
showing the expenditure on rent, food, clothing, and other items of expenditure. 
The cost of articles of food, clothing, etc., must be stated in such a manner as to be 
capable of verification, and selection of daily menus should be given, with notes on 
the cost and preparation of the food. 
I am of the opinion that an artisan budget would be of greater advantage than that 
of a family in a rural area—in the first place, at all events. In the country, part of 
the family income is generally ‘‘in kind.’’ Substantial prizes should be offered for 
the best essays, which should be published. They should, of course, be submitted 
under a nom de plume, and adjudged by a small committee of experts. The experi- 
ment is worth a trial.

CHAPTER XXXIII. 
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SWEDEN. 
By Dr. N. G. W. Lacerstept.' 
In order that American readers may obtain an accurate idea of the 
educational movements now going on in Sweden, it is desirable to 
consider briefly the origin of Swedish education and its characteristic 
features. The great problems of education of course are the same 
everywhere, but the order in which they are to be solved and the 
means of their solution may be quite different in a country such as 
the United States, where education has been built up from new foun- 
dations in comparatively recent time, and in countries of the Old 
World, where culture and education are of old origin and due con- 
sideration must be given to traditional forms of education. 
In Sweden, as well as in some other European countries, there were 
schools for higher education in the earlier part of the Middle Ages, 
i. e., cathedral schools, convent schools, and city schools. After the 
introduction of the Lutheran Reformation most of these schools 
remained, and had reached a comparatively high development as 
early as the seventeenth century. The secondary schools for boys 
of the present time are an immediate continuation of these schools. 
In the nineteenth century there arose in Sweden general interest 
in bringing the benefit of education to all members of society, and 
steps were taken to erect schools for the mass of the people in sufficient 
number. By the public elementary school statute of 1842 elementary 
education was made compulsory, and it was prescribed that each 
parish should have at least one public elementary school. Since then 
our elementary schools in the main have developed along the lines at 
first drawn up and may be said to have reached a high level with 
regard to the general extension of education. In Sweden practically 
all grown-up people nowadays are able to read and write. The 
statistics show that the per cent of illiteracy is only 0.1; Sweden, 
with the other Scandinavian countries and Germany, ranking fore- 
most in this respect of all countries in the world. 
Secondary schools for boys and elementary schools are both public 
schools in the sense that they are maintained at the expense of the 
State or of the communities. But there are also different kinds of 
private schools in Sweden, the most important of them being the 
girls’ secondary schools, nearly all of which came into existence in   
1 Prepared at the request of the Commissioner of Education. 
763
-P-A-G-E-818
    
  764 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
the latter half of the nineteenth century. The last-mentioned schools, 
however, as well as some other groups of private schools, may be 
considered as public in a certain degree, as they are subventioned by 
the State and communities and are subject to State regulations. 
It results from the different origin of the chief classes of schools and 
their development independently of each other that, with regard 
to inner work and outward organization, they present incongruities. 
These probably might have been avoided without greater inconven- 
ience and with saving of time, money, and human forces, and in all 
probability will be gradually removed. 
It is only natural in Sweden, although it may seem strange to an 
American, that for children up to the age of 13 there are three differ- 
ent kinds of schools, all more or less public, intended partly for the 
different sexes and partly for children from different classes of 
society. If this be an inconvenience, on which the opinions of 
Swedish educators are divided, it must still be admitted that the 
inconvenience is not so great as might be supposed, and at all events 
it has some undeniable advantages. The fees of public secondary 
schools for boys have always been very small, and pupils in poor 
circumstances are exempted from paying more than a trifle of the 
charge, consequently these schools have practically been open to 
all classes of society. Itis a fact that boys from the poorest classes 
have often been able to pass through these schools and rise afterwards 
to the highest positions in society. At present about 60 per cent of 
boys who enter the secondary schools have spent three years or more 
in the elementary schools, the first years of which may be considered, 
therefore, as the common basis of its own higher classes and of the 
secondary schools. It ought to be considered also that if children 
who are intended to receive a higher education enter at an early age 
a school preparing in a more direct way for such an education, they 
are enabled to save time and to begin their special studies sooner. 
Finally, the theoretical qualifications of male and female teachers 
of secondary schools are much better than those of elementary 
school-teachers, and this must be considered an advantage, also, 
with regard to the instruction in lower stages of education. 
Nevertheless, the ideal of progressive educators in our country is 
coeducation, at least within certain limits—social coeducation and 
coeducation of the sexes—and the evolution at present is decidedly 
going in that direction, as will be clear from what is mentioned below. 
In consequence of decisions that were made by the Rigsdag in 1904 
a very important reform with regard to public secondary schools for 
boys was accomplished and carried through during the following 
years. The chief features of the organization of these schools since 
the reform are the following:
-P-A-G-E-819
  
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SWEDEN. 765 
There are two kinds of public secondary schools for boys—modern 
schools (realskolor) of six years and higher-grade schools. A higher- 
grade school consists of a lower modern school and a higher ‘‘gym- 
nasium” of four years. The gymnasium, however, is not a direct 
continuation of the modern school, but continues from its fifth class. 
It makes the normal complete course for pupils, who also pass 
through the gymnasium or higher-grade secondary school, the entire 
course extending over a period of nine years. 
The higher-grade secondary schools as a rule are located in the 
larger towns. Most of the smaller towns have a modern school of 
six years. About half the number of these schools have been arranged 
on the plan of coeducation of boys and girls. By the school reform 
of 1904 the State for the first time established coeducational schools 
for secondary education. 
The course of the modern school of six years is a continuation of a 
previous course of three years in the public elementary school. 
Pupils who have gone through the modern school undergo a final 
examination (realskolexamen), which, if duly passed, entitles them 
to certain privileges, for instance that they be received as apprentices 
in some State service departments, as students in some special 
schools, ete. 
The four-year gymnasiums comprise two different lines, the modern 
gymnasium (realgymnasium) and the Latin gymnasium. Most 
higher-grade secondary schools contain both lines, a few of them 
only the realgymnasium or the Latin gymnasium. By the reform 
measure the study of Latin was limited to the four years of the Latin 
gymnasium. Previously Latin was studied the last*six years of the 
‘‘Latin line.” 
The gymnasium is concluded by a final examination (student- 
examen), chiefly serving as an entrance examination to the univer- 
sity, but also entitling to certain other privileges, i. e., entrance to 
some higher special schools, etc. 
The diagram given below is intended to make clear the relations 
of different Swedish schools and divisions of schools to each other. 
During the last two years of the gymnasium the students are 
allowed a certain liberty in choosing their subjects of instruction. 
They may be entirely relieved from pursuing one or (under certain 
conditions) two subjects. 
The public secondary schools for boys and all private secondary 
schools that receive State grants or have obtained some other State 
privilege are under the supervision of a State supervisory board 
(Kunglig Overstyrelsen for rikets allminna liroverk) of five mem- 
bers, one of whom is the president (Overdirektér). One of the du- 
ties incumbent on. the members of this board is to visit and inspect
-P-A-G-E-820
    766 EDUCATION REPORT, 1918. 
schools in different parts of the country. The supervisory board 
was instituted in connection with the school reform of 1904. 
The present organization of the secondary schools for boys, drawn 
up in 1904, may be said, upon the whole, to have worked very well. 
There is only one point on which more important changes have been 
proposed. As just mentioned, the students of the gymnasium within 
very narrow limits have a certain liberty in choosing their subjects. 
The question is now being discussed whether that liberty should not 
be essentially enlarged in such a way that each of the two present 
lines of the gymnasium should be divided into several regular lines 
preparing for different kinds of future callings or studies. A special

committee, appointed for the purpose, has been working for some 
months under the guidance of the supervisory board in the investi- 
gation of that matter. 
As mentioned before, the girls’ secondary schools, though private 
- Gn a few cases the community is the private owner of its school), 
are subventioned by the State and the communities. Their present 
conditions are regulated by statutes of 1909. In accordance with 
these statutes the female teachers are guaranteed salaries to certain 
minimum amounts, and the State, as well as the respective commu- 
nities and schools, have to contribute to their pension fund. 
In the year just mentioned, 1909, it was decided to institute a new 
kind of public secondary school, namely, the Intermediate School 
(Mellanskolor). The cost of such a school is paid by the respective
-P-A-G-E-821
  
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SWEDEN. 767 
community, with the help of a considerable State grant. The inter- 
mediate schools have for a basis the elementary school (infant school 
of two years and elementary school proper of four years). They 
comprise a course of four years and are intended to bring their pupils 
_as far as to the Realskolexamen. In nearly all cases these schools 
are coeducational. 
The immediate object in creating the schools in question no doubt 
was to care in a practical way for the needs of higher education ia 
townlike communities, boroughs, greater villages, etc., that have 
arisen in great number of late in our country. There was no pros- 
pect that the State would establish secondary schools of the old 
type in them; but the new schools also imply the application to a 
greater extent than before of the principle of using the common ele- 
mentary school as the basis of higher schools. For such extension 
it will be an advantage to have obtained a solid basis of experience 
with regard to the results attained by such schools. 
Objections have been made, especially by more conservative peda- 
gogues, against the intermediate schools, some of which undoubtedly 
may be considered to have a certain weight. It is said that four 
years is a rather short time for preparing pupils to fulfill the require- 
ments of the Realskolexamen. This refers especially to the require- 
ments in the two foreign languages, German and English. There is 
a certain risk that under such circumstances the pupils may be over- 
strained. With regard to this, however, it may be recalled that the 
normal age of the pupils in the intermediate schools is somewhat 
higher than that of the pupils in the Realskolor; the complete course 
of the former comprising ten years (six years elementary school, four 
years higher school) and the complete course of the latter only nine 
years (respectively; three years and six years). 
Another objection is that the requirements of competency being 
somewhat less with regard to teachers of intermediate schools, the 
general standard of culture (bildningsnivan) of the nation would be 
. lowered if the first-mentioned school should become the normal type 
of school instead of the latter. In order to form a judgment with 
regard to this matter, the following facts concerning the training of 
teachers in Sweden should be understood. 
The teachers that are appointed in elementary schools must have 
graduated at an ordinary training college. To enter such a college 
the candidate must show by examination that he or she has acquired 
at least a tolerably complete elementary school education. The 
course of such a college extends over four years. 
For the public secondary schools for boys, there are three principal 
kinds of teachers, namely, professors (lektorer) (in the higher grade   
1No doubt, sooner or later the question will arise of transforming the Realskolor, at least the coedu- 
cational ones, into the type represented by the intermediate schools.  
-P-A-G-E-822
  768 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
schools only), who are required to teach chiefly in the upper classes; 
assistant professors (adjunkter), who are required to teach only in 
the lower classes; and female teachers, three in every State coedu- 
cational school. ‘Lektorer”’ and “Adjunkter” must have gained 
university degrees according to special regulations, the requirements 
being higher for Lektorer. Moreover, every teacher of this class 
must have passed a probationary year at one of the secondary 
schools, where courses for that purpose are arranged, the work of the 
year embracing the theory of education and practical exercises in 
teaching. The female teachers are required to have the same quali- 
fications as adjuncts or to have satisfactorily passed the regular 
course of a duly approved higher training college for women teachers. 
Most of the teachers in girls’ secondary schools have passed a train- 
ing college of this kind. 
The teachers in intermediate schools, whether men or women, are 
required to have the same qualifications respectively as adjuncts as 
female teachers in the ordinary State secondary schools. There is 
also a possibility that elementary school-teachers or other teachers 
who are able to produce satisfactory testimonials with regard to special 
studies in subjects taught in the intermediate schools and in regard to 
their own work as teachers shall obtain certificates of competency for 
appointment in intermediate schools. This privilege depends upon 
a special decision of the Government, based upon the consideration 
of each individual case. 
From the arrangement just mentioned it might result, if the authori- 
ties are lax in according the competency in question, that teachers of 
intermediate schools in general should have a lower degree of efficiency 
than teachers of other State secondary schools. In the case of women 
‘teachers, however, the difference will be little or none, because since 
the salaries of such teachers in both classes of schools are nearly the 
same, candidates of high competency are as likely to apply for situa- 
tions in the one class of schools as in the other. In any case, there is 
no doubt that among teachers who have not obtained the certificate, 
of competency there may be very clever ones whom it would be a 
decided gain to secure for any school for children. 
It ought also to be remembered that, if the intermediate schools 
had not been established, in most cases there would have been private 
secondary schools in their place, and the competency of the teachers 
for these schools would have been inferior by far to that of the inter- 
mediate school-teachers. 
In the year 1906 a royal committee was appointed to investigate 
the organization of training colleges for elementary school-teachers 
and to make recommendations embodying the results of this in- 
vestigation. The chairman of the committee was Mr. Fridtjuv Berg, 
who had been minister of education for some months before, but
-P-A-G-E-823
  
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SWEDEN. 769 
left this office when a conservative ministry succeeded the liberal 
ministry to which he belonged. The scope of the committee was 
eventually enlarged to comprise also some other questions pertaining 
to popular education, and the number of members was increased. 
In December, 1911, the committee published their first very 
voluminous report, treating of the training colleges. Later the com- 
mittee issued two other reports, one treating the question of a super- 
visory board for all kinds of schools, and the other the reorganization 
of the work of school inspectors. On these reports were based three 
important Government bills laid before the Rigsdag of 1913, each 
referring to one of the questions just mentioned. 
It should be remarked here that in Sweden legislation pertains to 
the Government and the Rigsdag in common, but that reglementary 
ordinances, etc., are issued, according to the constitution, by the 
Government alone (as a branch of the King’s “ economic legislation’’). 
It has become, however, more and more the practice for the Govern- 
ment to invite the Rigsdag to decide conjointly with it even in these 
minor questions, and now no alteration of any great importance is 
carried through without the consent of the Rigsdag. 
Of the bills referred to, that relating to training colleges met with 
the approval of the Rigsdag in everything essential. On the ques- 
tion of a common supervisory board opinions proved to be much 
divided. The Government had proposed that a supervisory board 
for elementary schools and other institutions pertaining to popular 
education should be established and that this board and the previ- 
ously existing supervisory board for the secondary schools should 
form two different divisions of one common body, at the head of 
which there should be one chief. The conservatives were rather 
indifferent to the new board for the elementary schools, but they were 
very fearful that a common board might further the development of 
secondary schools along lines that they did not approve. The result 
was acompromise; the Rigsdag decided that a separate board should 
be established for popular education and that the board for secondary 
schools should function as it had done before. It seems very likely, 
however, that the many points of contact between the two boards 
will bring them into close connection with each other and that it is 
only a question of time when a common board such as was proposed 
by the Government will be instituted. 
Of details belonging to the organization of popular education under 
the guidance of the new board, one deserves special mention. The 
two existing school authorities, the local school boards and the 
“chapters,”’ are to be maintained, both of course subordinate to the 
new supervisory board. Sweden, it should be stated, has a State 
church, and in every diocese there is a chapter under the presidency 
17726°—xp 1918—vor 1——49
-P-A-G-E-824
  770 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of the bishop. - The chapters at present have the superintendence of 
popular education in the respective dioceses, and they will continue 
to hold an intermediate stage between the local school boards and 
the new central board. 
As for the Government bill on school inspection, the final decision 
of the Rigsdag was put off until the session of next year. One of the 
reasons for such action was the wish of the Rigsdag that the new super- 
visory board might have the opportunity of giving their opinion on the 
question, and thus contribute to the best possible solution of it. The 
reforms proposed with regard to school inspection have for their 
object chiefly that the inspectors, who hitherto as a rule have acted 
in that capacity in addition to some other work that has been their 
occupation, should hereafter have the duties of school inspector for 
their chief work. 
The decision of the Rigsdag with regard to training colleges involves 
the approval of the general principles laid down by the Government, 
and the appropriation of requisite means for carrying them into 
effect. The special statutes regulating the matter in detail will be 
published later by the Government. 
With regard to the proposed reforms the following statements may 
be of general interest. At present the training-college course extends 
over four years, and the candidate for entering must show by exami- 
nation that he or she has acquired at least a tolerably complete 
elementary-school education. The general aim of the regulations 
now in force is to insure that the training colleges shall impart 
chiefly the same kind of knowledge to their students as the latter 
should impart hereafter to their own pupils, and that essentially the 
same methods of instruction should be used as in the elementary 
schools. Under the new regulations the content of the instruction 
in the training colleges will be more adapted to the age of the students, 
and methods are to be used based upon their own study and observa- 
tions. The students in the training colleges accordingly will gain a 
more decided habit of self-activity. There is no doubt that instruc- 
tion of this kind will have the tendency to excite the interest of the 
students in continuing their own studies afterwards and will prepare 
them better for such efforts. 
The question has been discussed whether the course of the training 
colleges should not be extended to comprise five years. It has been 
decided, however, to maintain the present length of the course, but 
in order that the students may be better prepared for the new 
methods of study the requirements of admission have been essentially 
increased. 
To the subjects now included in the training-college course two 
new ones will be added, namely, a foreign language and ‘‘economy.”’ 
As for the foreign language, it will be English or German, but only 
 
-P-A-G-E-825
  
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SWEDEN, T71 
one of the two languages for each individual college. The subject 
“economy” is intended to comprise the historical development of 
the economic life as well as its most important phenomena at the 
present time, and especially the industrial life of our own country. 
In addition to the reforms in the training colleges now decided 
upon, considerably larger yearly appropriations have been voted by 
the Rigsdag to increase their libraries, apparatus, and materials of 
instruction. 
In order that the best possible professors of the colleges may be 
obtained, it is of great importance that they should have the induce- 
ment of good salaries. It is intended that the present scale of salaries 
shall be raised in a short time. For certain reasons this could not 
be done at the Rigsdag’s session this year. 
What has been said may have made it clear that very important 
changes have taken place with regard to Swedish education during 
the past decade, changes which in my opinion mean decided progress 
in a good direction. It is, then, only just to mention the names of 
those persons who in the first place have been active in bringing 
about the reforms. The reforms of 1904, the reorganization of sec- 
ondary schools for boys, are due chiefly to Ernst Carlson and Carl 
von Frieson, both now deceased. The former, a secondary-school 
professor, as a member of the Rigsdag took up the question there, 
and this led to the decisions in consequence of which a royal com- 
mittee on the matter was appointed. Carlson and Von Frieson both 
became members of that committee. Later on Von Frieson was 
appointed minister of ecclesiastical affairs and education, and in that 
capacity he prepared the royal bill on the subject which was pre- 
sented to the Rigsdag of 1904. Carlson became the first president 
of the new supervisory board for the secondary schools. 
The regulation of the relations between State subventioned private 
schools and the State, as they were settled in 1909, as well as the 
erection of intermediate schools, is the work chiefly of P. E. Lind- 
strém, minister of education at that time, and Fridtjuv Berg, member 
of the Rigsdag and very active in the select committee of the Rigsdag, 
who had to prepare the matter. Mr. Berg, whose name has already 
been mentioned in this paper, is the present minister of education, 
and in that capacity prepared the Government bills which led to the 
important decisions adopted by the Rigsdag in 1913. He may be 
considered the most prominent of living Swedish educators, not only 
on account of the high position he occupies, but also on account of 
what he has accomplished as a writer on educational subjects, editor 
of a widely circulated pedagogical newspaper, and an influential 
member of the Rigsdag. His career is a rather uncommon one in 
our country. His original and essential calling was that of an ele- 
mentary-school teacher, and no doubt he still considers himself as a
-P-A-G-E-826
772 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
teacher above everything else. Though he has passed no university 
examinations, he has acquired by private study a high degree of 
intellectual culture, and in recognition of that attainment the Uni- 
versity of Upsala has conferred upon him the honorary degree of 
doctor of philosophy. It is his enthusiastic interest for the cause of 
education, especially the education of the people, his ability as a 
politician, as well as his intellectual and moral qualities on the whole, 
that have made it possible for him to rise to the post he now occupies. 
He is the first elementary-school teacher in our country who has 
become minister of the Crown.

INTRODUCTION. 
The smaller kingdoms of Europe bordering on the North Sea in- 
clude, besides Sweden, two Scandinavian countries—Norway and 
Denmark—the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and Belgium. 
The educational systems of the Scandinavian countries preserve 
the evidences of their common origin in their school administration, 
their ample provision for the elementary education of all the people, 
compulsory school attendance laws, and the ready access to higher 
institutions for all who reach the entrance standards. The main 
features of the Swedish system, described in Chapter XX XIII, per- 
tain also to the systems of Denmark and Norway. 
In the adaptation of school training to the actual needs of the peo- 
ple and in provision for vocational training, the Scandinavian coun- 
tries are in advance of English-speaking nations, and they have 
originated several expedients of great value in the general conduct 
of popular education. Among these may be mentioned the Ling 
system of gymnastics and the sloyd system of manual training, both 
of which originated in Sweden, and which, in either principle or 
methods, have been adopted in many other countries. The people’s 
high school, the institution by means of which Denmark has provided 
for the continued ethical and civic training of its adult population, 
either in its Danish form or in the modified form of county high 
schools for adults developed in Norway, has been copied in parts of 
the United States. 
Radical changes in the school systems are not to be expected under 
the conditions that exist in the countries here considered. Every 
year’s record, however, affords proof of the purpose to keep the 
methods and provision of popular education close to the vital needs 
773

  774 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
of the people. Complaints are made from time to time of antiquated 
forms of administration and too close regard for traditional methods 
of instruction; the teachers’ associations of the three Scandinavian 
countries are extremely active and agitate for greater freedom and 
better remuneration for the members of the profession. To a cer- 
tain extent also there is opposition to the excess of clerical influences 
in the management of the schools. 
CURRENT EVENTS. 
The following notes pertaining to celebrations, investigations, and 
associations’ meetings, or to isolated efforts for the improvement of 
schools, are taken from current educational journals ' of the countries 
veferred to, from official correspondence, and consular reports. 
  
DENMARK. 
Centennial celebration. Denmark is making preparation for a jubi- 
lee celebration to take place in 1914, commemorative of the great 
event 100 years ago, which not only affected the political destiny of 
Denmark, but also its public school system, the educational code of 
Frederick VI promulgated in 1814 being the foundation of the present 
school system of Denmark. In order to prepare for this celebration 
the teachers’ association of Denmark has been holding meetings in 
Copenhagen, and has announced several important commemorative 
publications. Among these is a collection of descriptive and biograph- 
ical sketches of a great number of well-known teachers and their 
work as authors, statesmen, etc., prepared with the assistance of Dr. 
Benthin, the distinguished archivist. 
Child labor.—From an investigation recently made in Denmark 
for the purpose of ascertaining to what extent school children are 
obliged to work for their living, it appears that of 370,000 children, 
45,000 performed such work in their homes and 65,000 for strangers. 
In the country it was found that 5 per cent of the children of great 
farmers, 26 per cent of the children of small farmers, and 41 per cent 
of country laborers’ children worked for strangers. 
Some children began such work at 6 years of age, and nearly 14,000 
were only 10 years or less. One-half of the children had a working 
day of 10 hours or more. The day’s work began in certain cases at 
4 a.m., and for 2,500 children it began at 5 to 5.30 a. m. and seldom 
ended before 10 p. m. The day’s wage for 4,000 children was 10 
cents each, together with food, and many received only 10 cents 
without food.

NORWAY. 
Child welfare-—Several places in Norway are taking measures to 
promote the physical welfare of school children. The American con- 
sul at Stavanger reports that the city council has instituted a depart- 
ment for the examination and treatment of the school children. Two 
dental rooms have been fitted up, and, at the opening of the schools, 
August 17, 1912, were ready for use by the children. The council 
appropriated the sum of 3,000 crowns ($804) for dental instruments 
and apparatus to start with, and the sum of 5,700 crowns ($1,527.60) 
for maintenance for the first session, of the school. 
The consul notes that much of the dental equipment has been 
secured from America, and the dental surgeon selected to take charge 
of the work received his postgraduate dental course in the United 
States. 
The city of Bergen maintained an open-air school at Mjolfjell, to 
which 30 delicate school children from the city were sent for a 
month’s recreation and instruction. They returned from their stay 
in the mountains strong, active, and greatly improved in health. The 
community appropriated 1,000 crowns ($268) for this experiment. 
Improvement of teachers.—In all the school programs prominent 
place is given to singing, but the teaching is far from satisfactory. 
A music committee appointed to investigate the subject expresses 
the opinion that the first requisite is better training for the teachers 
in this particular art, and advises that more time be given to the 
subject in the normal schools and under the direction of competent 
professors. It is recommended by this committee that in order to 
secure a position as teacher of music and singing in the training 
colleges the candidate should pass the organist examination prepared 
by the church department and should have completed a course at a 
conservatory of music. It was advised that $28 a week should be 
allowed for this branch in the training school. 
A language course is offered in the school for teachers at Elverum. 
The course begins July 3, and is maintained 7 weeks. Instruction 
is given in reading, translation, grammar, conversation, and com- 
position in two languages—English and German. Nineteen teachers 
received traveling scholarships for the school year 1913-14. The 
sum appropriated for this purpose was 10,000 crowns ($2,680). 
The Norwegian Teachers’ Domestic Science Training School received 
an appropriation from the Storthing of 56,400 crowns ($15,115.20); 
10,180 crowns ($1,728.24) to be used as a revenue; 46,220 crowns 
($12,386.96) for expenses. The salary for the superintendent was 
fixed at 1,800 crowns ($482.40); 1,200 crowns ($321.60) for the head 
instructor and for the teacher in cookery; and 900 crowns ($242.10) 
for an assistant instructor.

SWEDEN. 
Church music conference.—The King of Sweden appropriated 500 
crowns ($134) to cover the expenses of a general church music con- 
ference to be held in Linkoping in 1913. 
Teachers’ associations.—The importance of promoting more inti- 
mate relations between school and home was discussed at the May 
meeting of the Karlskoga teachers’ association, one of the constituent 
societies of the general teachers’ association of Sweden. It was 
advised that meetings of parents and teachers should be held to 
promote better understanding of their common interests. 
At the same meeting the subject of textbooks in the primary schools 
was considered and a special committee was appointed to investigate 
this matter and report the results of their inquiries at the fall meeting. 
The annual meeting of domestic-science teachers was held in Got- 
tenborg on August 16. From the report of a special committee 
presented at the meeting, it appears that continuation courses have 
been provided at different centers in washing and ironing, in baking, 
and in the preparation of food. Petitions were sent to the King 
concerning the regulation of the salaries of domestic-science teachers 
in the common schools and the changes in the requirements for receiv- 
ing State aid for promoting instruction in the subject. 
The manual training school at Naas.—The commencement exercises 
for the first summer courses at Naas were held on July 16. The total 
number of students was 230, of whom there were 101 students in 
sloyd, 75 in drawing and modeling, 29 in physical culture, 21 in 
domestic science, and 4 in gardening. Of these there were 5 students 
from Norway, 4 from Finland, 1 from England, 6 from Austria, 1 
from Brazil, and 3 from South Africa; all the remaining students 
were Swedes. 
The late summer courses in sloyd, physical culture, and gardening 
began, on July 23. There were 226 students, and of these one was 
from Australia. Besides Sweden, 15 nations are represented. 
The general association of teachers.—The fifteenth annual meeting 
of the association of common-school teachers in Sweden was held 
July 1-3 at Lund. Between 1,500 and 1,600 delegates attended the 
meeting, which was one of the largest school conferences that have 
taken place in Sweden. The discussion related to important phases 
of school work, viz, vocational training, child welfare, instruction in 
sloyd, language study, etc. 
Particular interest was aroused by an address on continuation 
schools, The speaker, Per Borgh, described the present state of the 
continuation school in comparison with the common school, and then 
explained its aim and purpose. He said in part: 
Ii the work in the common school is to bear fruit in the integrity, efficiency, and 
patriotism of the Swedish people, then the young people during the so-called transi-
-P-A-G-E-831
SWEDEN. T17 
tion period must not be left without any influence from the school, but must continue 
to have the benefit of training and education. 
As the continuation school is higher than the common school and not a substitute 
for it, its courses should be prepared for students who have finished the common 
school or have received an equivalent education, and they should be arranged accord- 
ing to local conditions, so as to train the student for the practical affairs of life. The 
course of the continuation school should cover at least two years. Since this instruc- 
tion, as a rule, will be given by the common-school teachers, they should have an 
opportunity to study special continuation courses at the expense of a general fund. 
Centennial celebration of Swedish gymnastics.—The one hundredth 
anniversary of the famous Ling system of Swedish gymnastics was 
celebrated May 5 of the present year. One hundred years ago the 
King of Sweden granted the inventor of the system, Per Henrik 
Ling, permission to teach gymnastics in Stockholm, and soon after- 
wards he founded and became the director of the Gymnastic Central 
Institute. Throughout the whole country the schools observed the 
anniversary, the chief celebration being the students’ exhibition, 
which was held in the stadium at Stockholm. The participants were 
1,500 young athletes, under the leadership of Capt. B. E. Littorin. 
The rapidity with which they obeyed the commands of their leader 
and the precision of their movements excited the greatest admiration. 
The universities and smaller schools celebrated the occasion with 
speeches and music. Several groups of young people decorated the 
grave of Ling as an expression of gratitude for what he had done for 
the physical health and strength of the people. 
Grants to teachers.—For the year 1913 the King of Sweden granted 
the sum of 1,300 crowns ($571.80) for the study of domestic science 
in foreign countries. This sum will be distributed among three 
teachers, who will spend from four to six weeks in Denmark, Holland, 
and Germany. Each teacher must make a full report of her work 
within four months after her return to Sweden. 
A scholarship of 500 crowns ($134) was granted to Mr. G. Bergh 
for the purpose of spending about four weeks in studying the school 
system and the instruction in the public schools of the United States. 
Mr. Bergh was the secretary of the committee to represent Sweden 
at the International Congress of School Hygiene in Buffalo. 
Legislative acts—By an act of May 23, 1913, the Swedish Parlia- 
ment increased the total appropriation for the salaries of teachers in 
the common schools from 11,200,000 crowns ($3,001,600) to 11,700,000 
crowns ($3,135,600); a few days later the Parliament unanimously 
decided to make an important change in the curriculum of the com- 
mon schools. Among other subjects, instruction will be given in 
political economy and one foreign language, either German or English.

CURRENT EVENTS. 
The present year closes a century of independence for the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands, and the event has been celebrated by many cere- 
monies and expositions. The latter included a navigation exposition 
at Amsterdam and an exposition significantly termed ‘The Woman,” 
which was intended to illustrate the development in woman’s status 
and work in the period 1813 to 1913. The idea was well sustained, 
and the novel exposition formed a center of interest during the 
international meeting of women held at The Hague in May. 
The Kingdom holds high rank among European nations for the 
general diffusion of education and the low degree of illiteracy, 
although in the latter respect it is surpassed by the neighboring 
Scandinavian countries. Statistics for 1900 showed for the Nether- 
lands 1.4 per cent of illiterates among the army recruits, against less 
than one-half of 1 per cent in Sweden and Denmark. The contrast 
in this respect was one of the causes of the support secured for the 
compulsory provision included in the education law of 1900. The 
law also gave some advantage to public secular schools, as compared 
with denominational schools; but this advantage was incidental to 
the main purpose of the provisions with regard to the teachers’ sala- 
ries, an advantage that could not be extended to private schools with- 
out radical changes in existing laws. Private schools, however, were 
placed upon the same basis as public schools with respect to State 
subventions. The effect of the law, on the whole, has been to increase 
the number of denominational schools. According to statistics of 
1911, on a total of 916,594 pupils, 353,547, or a little more than 38 
‘per cent, were enrolled in schools under the control of the various 
religious bodies. 
The Liberal Party in the Netherlands, as in other countries, are 
striving for the establishment of a free system of secular education 
under public control, and since their power has been greatly increased 
by recent elections, it is believed that an amendment to the school 
law looking to that final result will be submitted to the States- 
General. 
Ample provision is made in the Kingdom, both by public and 
private agencies, for industrial and technical training. The indus- 
trial or technical schools of the lower order have always been regarded 
as complementary to the elementary schools, but the law of 1900 
made the completion of the elementary grades an obligatory pre- 
requisite for admission to the lower technical schools. This action 
reenforces the compulsory provision of the law, as parents are eager 
to secure the practical training for their children.

The latest development in industrial education is the plan for 
bringing to rural communities systematic instruction for women in 
household duties and the lighter forms of farm work which fall to 
their lot. Such instruction has hitherto been given in various insti- 
tutions throughout the country, but the present purpose is to relate 
it directly to rural life. For this purpose, plans for itinerary classes 
have been adopted, following the example of Ireland and Germany. 
The courses of instruction which have been already provided for 
include nature study, zoology, botany, and practical training in house- 
hold industries, including the selection and preparation of food, the 
purchase of material, and keeping accounts. 
THE UNIVERSITIES. 
The scientific prestige of the Dutch universities was brought vividly 
to the minds of Americans by the participation of Dr. Hugo de Vries 
in the international congresses held at St. Louis in 1904 in connection 
with the Louisiana purchase exposition. This memory is revived at 
the present time by the arrival in this country of Dr. C. Snouck Hur- 
gronje, of the University of Leyden, who is equally distinguished for 
oriental learning and for his work in colonial administration. Dr. 
Hurgronje was sent by his Government to the Dutch East Indies with 
the mission of studying the relation of Islamism to the life of that 
region, and subsequently served the colonial government’as an adviser 
on Arabian and native affairs. It was largely through his influence 
that the Government entered upon the educational experiment which 
has made the Dutch colony an instructive and inspiring example for 
all colonial administrations. 
UNIVERSITY OF COMMERCE AT ROTTERDAM.! 
On November 8, 1913, his excellency, Cort van der Linden, Dutch minister of the 
interior, in the presence of several high Government, provincial, and city authorities, 
officially opened the Netherlands University of Commerce (Nederlandsche Handels- 
Hoogeschool) at Rotterdam. This is the first commercial university to be instituted 
in the Netherlands. The funds for its maintenance were raised from private sources— 
leading business men and bankers contributing to it—neither the Government nor 
city granting any subsidy. 
The president of the board of directors is Dr. D. Bos, member of the second chamber 
of the States-General (Congress), one of the foremost authorities on education in the 
Netherlands; the president of the university is Prof. Dr. G. W. J. Bruins, formerly one 
of the head officials of the provincial States of south Holland. 
The different courses to be taught in the university may be divided into five head 
groups, as follows: (1) Economics and statistics. (2) Commercial science. (3) Judi- 
cial science. (4) Economic history and geography. (5) Technical sciences. 
In the first place it is the intention of the school to give a general commercial educa- 
tion. After a course of two years an examination for commercial economies will be 
held, embracing the following branches: (1) General doctrine and history of economics,

-P-A-G-E-834
  780 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
(2) General doctrine of bookkeeping, balances, and application of mathematics in 
commerce. (3) Civil law, commercial law, law on bankruptcy, etc. (4) Economic 
history of the present decade, economic geography especially of the Netherlands and 
its colonies. 
‘The examination may also include one or more of the following subjects: (1) Credit 
and banking system. (2) Commercial and general traffic. (3) Insurance. (4) B 
ness doctrine. (5) General doctrine of statistics. 
The other courses included in this examination, which are likewise useful, may be 
divided into two groups, as follows: (1) Those of general nature, i. e., political econ- 
omy, international law, general history of the present decade, and— 
(2) Those in connection with education for a special brahch of business, i. e., 
insurance, banking, traffic, industry, etc. 
Both male and female students will be admitted. 
Besides general education for commerce, the university will have courses for the 
following classes of individuals: (1) Candidates for consular and diplomatic ex: 
inations. (2) Accountants. (3) Actuaries (insurance). (4) Tutors of commerciz 
science. 
Asa rule, the course of study for these groups will extend over a period of more than 
two years. 
Special attention will be paid to study for the consular service. Foreign languages 
will also be taught, as well as bookkeeping. 
The university can also be entered to advantage by persons who are in some way 
connected with trade and commerce, i. e., lawyers, journalists, etc. For them it is, 
of course, not necessary to follow all the various courses; special arrangements will be 
made for them and for business men already having a practical knowledge of trade and 
commerce. 
When the Government shall have been found willing to cooperate with the univer- 
sity to instituté a doctorate in commercial science, the examination in political econ- 
omy will be considered one of the preliminary examinations for this doctorate. 
The library and archives of the university will be so located as to enable the students 
especially those having no opportunity to study at home to study there. 
The courses commenced November 10, 1913, with an enrollment of 55 students; 
classes are for the present held in the Exchange Building until suitable quarters are 
built. 
In leading business circles it is the general opinion that the university has a great 
future, and that it will be of benefit not only to the trade and commerce of Rotterdam, 
but to the whole country. : 
     
  BELGIUM. 
LEGISLATIVE MEASURES, 
The questions of absorbing interest in Belgium relate to the pending 
pill amending the present law of primary education. Although a com- 
pulsory provision is included in the measure, it is in the main objec- 
tionable to the Liberals, and its discussion in the Chamber of Deputies 
and in public meetings revives the intense antagonisms that have 
attended the passage of previous laws regulating primary education. 
The first law on this subject was passed in 1842, 12 years after the 
separation of Belgium from the Netherlands. This law required 
every commune to maintain at least one primary school in an acces- 
sible place; the school, however, was not necessarily a public school, 
 
-P-A-G-E-835
  BELGIUM. 781 
that is, established and managed by the civil authorities, but might 
be a private school (parochial) under private management or adopted 
and subsidized by the commune. 
In 1879 the Liberal Party having come into power, a new law, 
almost revolutionary in its character, was passed. Every commune 
was now required to establish at least one public school, the actual 
number to be determined in each case by the Government. The 
State was authorized to require also the establishment of an infant 
school and a school for adults in any commune where this action 
was deemed desirable. Provision was made for the State inspection 
of all primary schools; only native Belgians furnished either with the 
diploma of a primary teacher or of a professor in the lower order of 
secondary schools might be appointed as teachers. The employ- 
ment in this capacity of members of a religious order was strictly 
forbidden, and ecclesiastical instruction in schools was abolished. 
The program of obligatory studies was extended and religious instruc- 
tion excluded. This matter was to be left to the family and the 
churches, but the law provided that clergymen might be allowed the 
use of a room in a school building, before or after the school session, to 
give religious instruction to the children of their respective churches. 
In 1884 the Catholic Party having gained a majority in the legis- 
lature, a new school law was passed, which returned to the conditions 
under the law of 1842. It provided for the adoption of private 
schools, restored religious instruction to the programs as an optional 
branch, opened the teaching service to naturalized foreigners, and in 
general gave a large measure of independence to the communes with 
respect to the conduct of schools. In 1895 religious instruction was 
made an obligatory subject and confided to the clergy, and subsidies 
for private elementary schools were increased. The laws of 1884 and 
1895 gave ecclesiastical authorities control over the schools in a 
majority of the communes, a policy which is violently opposed by the 
Liberal Party. The grounds of this opposition are not entirely 
political. They are found partly in the failure of the schools to meet 
present economic and industrial requirements; indeed, members of 
both parties recognize the need of a more rigorous control of primary 
schools, an effective compulsory attendance law, and an extension of 
the period and the agencies of education for the industrial classes 
Without considering here the contest between the two parties for the 
actual control of the schools, it is-instructive to observe the facts 
with reference to schoo] attendance in Belgium that were brought 
out in a recent discussion of the pending bill.

    782 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
From a statement made in the Chamber of Deputies by M. Lam- 
borelle, deputy from Malines, it appears that for the latest year 
reported, 1911, the enrollment in all the primary schools of the 
country was 973,655; the estimated number of children 6 to 14 years 
of age was 1,187,000; hence 213,345 children of school age were not 
included in the enrollment. Excluding from this number children 
above 6 years of age attending infant schools, i. c., 4,439; the 55,174 
children above 14 years of age attending schools of adults; also the 
estimated number of abnormal children, and there remain in round 
numbers 150,000 children 6 to 14 years of age who were not under 
instruction. 
This fact, however, as observed by M. Lamborelle, is less alarming 
than the evidences of irregular attendance and early withdrawal from 
school. With respect to the former it was shown that the primary 
schools, public, adopted, and subsidized, were open during the year 
247.27 days, but the actual number of days’ attendance averaged only 
199.65 for each pupil. This was equivalent to one day of absence 
for every five school days. 
It was further shown by M. Lamborelle that the majority of pupils 
never finish the elementary course. Thus in 1911, of 118,433 pupils 
who left school, 41,484 had attended less than four years, 42,485 be- 
tween four and five years, and only 31,468 had finished the primary 
course. ‘‘Nowhere in Europe,” he said, ‘‘excepting in Portugal, 
Spain, and Italy, is school attendance so unsatisfactory as in our own 
country.” + 
ACTION OF THE TEACHERS’ FEDERATION- 
The general federation of Belgian teachers, which is recruited almost 
entirely from teachers and school officers of liberal tendencies, cele- 
brated its fifty-sixth anniversary. at the congress held the present 
year at Ghent, August 30 to September 4. On this occasion the 
pending school law was the chief subject of consideration. The 
demands of the Liberal Party in respect to primary education are 
embodied in the resolutions adopted by this congress, which provide: 
First, for the establishment of a public school taught by a secular 
teacher in every commune in which a demand to that effect is made by 
the fathers of families comprising 20 children of school age; second, 
that in every mixed school one or more women teachers shall be 
employed competent to instruct girls in sewing and other domestic 
arts; third, that primary schools which do not offer the complete 
official program of studies shall not be aided by public money; 
fourth, that religious and philosophic convictions of parents shall be

respected in public schools, and that no member of a religious order 
shall be appointed as teacher in such schools; fifth, in case any com- 
mune neglects its obligation in these respects, the State shall supply 
the deficiency.* 
TECHNICAL AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS. 
The schools of art and industry, for which Belgium is justly re- 
nowned, form no part of the system of instruction to which the 
pending legislation pertains; they are under the administration of 
the minister of agriculture and the minister of industry and labor. 
The schools of the latter department include: Superior school of 
commerce at Antwerp (founded 1852); provincial school of Hainaut 
at Mons (1837); industrial schools; apprenticeship schools (ateliers 
d’apprentissage) ; professional schools and courses; schools of domes- 
tic economy, and housework for girls. The names of the first two 
and the last in the list sufficiently indicate their purposes. The 
industrial schools are characterized in official reports as schools 
intended— 
to give the workman scientific instruction which he is unable to obtain in the work- 
shop; to procure for him the means of improving his material condition and of develop- 
ing his intelligence; to lead him gradually away from the tyranny of routine, and to 
increase the economic value of his labor, and thus to enable him to contribute to 
increased production for his own good and for the national benefit. 
These schools are supported mainly by Government and municipal 
grants. Tuition is free. The sessions are held generally in the 
evening and on Sunday morning, although several have also weekday 
sessions. The courses are not uniform, being determined on the 
technical side by the requirements of local industries. The general 
course comprises the French or Flemish language, according to the 
geographical location of the schools; mathematics in its applications 
to industry; physics, theoretical and applied; chemistry, general 
and applied; mechanics, hygiene, industrial economy, and drawing. 
The last named is the basis of the special instruction. 
A characteristic feature of this system is the provision made for 
the training of girls for the commercial and industrial employments 
which are open to women, and the schools of household industry. 
The latter have attracted wide attention and are generally recognized 
as models. 
An important outcome of the domestic training of women is the 
formation of cercles de fermiéres, or societies for promoting the domes- 
tic arts in rural communities. These circles number at the present 
time 200 groups, with more than 20,000 members. In 1912 they 
held 806 conferences, which were attended by 80,143 women. The 
local circles are federated by provinces and directed by a national

committee, the president of which is Mme. la Baronne Rotsart de 
Hertaing. The federation maintains two journals, La Fermiére, 
published in the French language, and De Bverin, the organ of the 
Flemish circles. 
Through the efforts of the national committee and under the 
patronage of the Minister of Agriculture, courses of instruction were 
established at Brussels during the present year to provide lecturers 
for the circles, and an examination held to test the knowledge and 
the power of practical demonstration acquired by the students. 
In January, 1912, in cooperation with the Ligue Nationale Belge 
de Education Familiale, the national committee established a 
series of conferences for women of the aristocracy for the purpose of 
arousing their interest in rural matters and in opportunities for 
promoting the general welfare by this interest. The course of 
instruction in rural economy was particularly successful and has 
been published in a book which has had wide circulation under the 
title Le Bien-étre a la Campagne.   
WELFARE ACTIVITIES. 
Notwithstanding the fact that in regard to the extension of primary 
education Belgium is in a backward state as compared with the 
neighboring Kingdoms of Europe, several communes have made 
- great progress in promoting the general welfare of the children of 
the poorer classes by means of vacation colonies, medical inspection 
of schools, and the distribution of clothing and meals to poor children. 
In 1912 the city of Brussels maintained 17 vacation colonies for 
children of the public schools, in which 880 children were cared for 
during an average period of 14 days each. Private associations 
cared for 1,500 children in similar colonies for an average of 10 days 
each. Vacation schools maintained by the city enrolled above 800 
pupils. Two private societies which supplied food to the poorer 
pupils of the city schools received aid from the local authorities to 
the amount of $2,400.

FRANCE. 
THE NEW SPIRIT. 
One of the strongest evidences that France has reacted against the 
decadent tendencies which followed the exhausting experiences of 
defeat after the Franco-Prussian war is the awakening in respect to 
education. This awakening is indicated by the growing interest of 
the industrial classes in scientific and vocational education, by the 
confident tone of university men, and by the spread of French 
scholastic influences to other nations. These movements, it is true, 
have not yet affected the official record of education or resulted in 
legislative action, but they are apparent to everyone familiar with 
current events in France. They are accompanied by reviving vigor 
and hopefulness on the part of the élite youth of the nation, which 
is in striking contrast to the effete and skeptical spirit of the previous 
generation. This development is discussed in a recent article by 
Dr. Georges Chatterton-Hill, docent in sociology at the University of 
Geneva, who attributes the change in great measure to the influence of 
the works of Paul Bourget, Maurice Barrés, and Henry Bordeaux. 
With regard to these authors he says: 
These three are incontestably those that appeal most greatly to the intellectual 
youth of present-day France. And when we have named them we have indicated at 
once the tendencies of this “intellectual youth,”’ its sympathies and aspirations. The 
three writers in question are of pronounced conservative leanings; one is an ardent 
royalist, another is a leader of the Parliamentary Nationalist Party !; all three are 
Catholics and staunch defenders of the church; all three preach the imperative neces- 
  
1M. Maurice Barrés, who is deputy for the first arrondissement of Paris.

788 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
sity of a return to the time-honored traditions of France, to those traditions of authority 
and hierarchy and adaptation of capacity to function which the Revolution so impru- 
dently broke with; all three search persistently and indefatigably for an adequate 
principle of authority, consequently for a principle of social integration and cohesion— 
and they all find this fundamental principle embodied in religion, in the family, in 
‘the attachment of the individual to his native soil. Religious discipline, family 
discipline, patriotic discipline—on these three aspects of the discipline so essential 
to the continuity of social existence MM. Bourget, Barrés, and Bordeaux never cease 
to insist.! 
Among the indications of this new spirit noted by Dr. Chatterton- 
Hill are “the patriotism of the intellectual youth of France”’; “the 
love of adventure and the pleasure in sports’’—the latter evidenced 
by the fact that while “ten years ago sport was almost an unknown 
quantity in the schools, to-day the love of sport in all its forms has 
become general”; and finally, “the renascence of faith.’’ Of this 
last sign of reawakening, our author says: 
Out of the students of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris upward of 40 are 
to-day good and true Catholics, partaking of the sacraments of the church, and whose 
names are inscribed on the list of the Conférence St. Vincent de Paul of their parish. 
Ten years ago the number of such Catholics at the Ecole Normale was not more than 
3 or 4. In the largest State schools (lycées) in Paris—such as Condorcet, Henry IV, 
Louis-le-Grand—the renascence of Catholicism among the pupils is not less visible. 
The rector of the Institut Catholique de Paris, Mgr. Baudrillart, has borne witness to 
this renascence of faith among the “intellectual youth.” 
The article concludes as follows: 
Thecontemporary youth of France loves realizations; it lovesaction. Loving action, 
it appreciates the necessity of order and discipline, without which all action must be 
sterile. For this reason does it tend to Catholicism; for this reason is it ardently 
patriotic. Two of the greatest authorities in France, M. Alexandre Ribot and M. 
Henri Bergson, have expressed their confidence in this youth, their belief in the 
reawakening of France, in the renascence of French energy; and all the friends and 
admirers of France may share this belief and this confidence.? 
In the educational world the new spirit that is moving in France 
is manifested by a resistance to official domination and the freer 
expression of individual and professional opinions. 
THE CRISIS IN PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
The system of primary education, which is essentially the work of 
the Republic, has reached the stage when new endeavors are necessary 
for its continued progress. The difficulties which threaten the sys- 
tem were summed up in the Chamber of Deputies by the chairman 
of the committee on the budget for 1913, as follows: 
  
1 The works particularly named in the article are Le Disciple, L’Etape, Un Divorce, and L’Emigré, by 
Bourget; L’Ennemi des Lois, Au service de l’ Allemagne, Colette Baudoche, and la Colline inspirée, by 
Barrés; and La Neige sur les Pas and La Maison, by Bordeaux.

-P-A-G-E-843
  FRANCE. 789 
The present budget is facing all the unsolved problems advocated before the Cham- 
ber last year with an intensity which justified the thought that reforms would surely 
follow close upon the promises of that body. 
The present inertia will one day press heavily upon the Republic. Not to raise 
questions at all is a less evil than to raise them without offering a solution. Citizens 
in general and those persons especially interested naturally take all propositions as 
assured if they emanate from the Government, and in our excitable democracy anger 
quickly rises, followed by disaffection and indifference over the disappointments 
caused by a régime of liberty. 
It must be admitted that conditions themselves are in part responsible for present _ 
dissatisfaction. By an unfortunate counteraction the Republic, in multiplying 
schools everywhere, in endeavoring to raise the teachers to a higher plane, in seeking 
to secure for the children an education, more varied and more extended, has created 
contradictions that it is unable to overcome, and thus the Government is the victim 
of its own good intentions. 
Schools were opened; then came the ambition to supply them with teachers who 
had extended their knowledge and increased their pedagogical ability. Hence nor- 
mal schools were created where a severe course of study held captive for three years 
young women and young men who were to be prepared for the most delicate service; 
it was then recognized that the primary school only affords the children very elemen- 
tary instruction, and therefore higher primary schools were created which offer more 
extended training. There followed the thought that the children of the small trades- 
men would have need of diplomas carrying some social value. Hence the higher 
primary schools were provided with industrial annexes which gave to industry and 
commerce young people already prepared for work. Who could criticize this move- 
ment? Noone. 
But consider, however, one result. The higher primary schools, to the number of 
nearly 430 (430 in 11 years), have drawn to themselves more than 53,000 pupils of both 
sexes, of whom more than 6,000 have followed the courses of the technical sections 
(agricultural, commercial, industrial, household economy). Industry and commerce 
allure and reward them in the larger cities or in the smaller towns, which exercise 
their attractions, often deceptive, upon the young people of the rural community. 
This may be well. 
Among the young people who follow these courses of the higher primary are found 
those who formerly presented themselves as candidates for the normal schools; com- 
merce, industry, stenography, typewriting, clerical positions in the post and telegraph 
offices, all these opportunities now open before them. Herein great partis the explana- 
tion of the dangers which to-day threaten primary education. The candidates for the 
men’s normal schools decline, and the discouraging statistics which were published 
for 1910 continue for the year 1911 to offer proof that this decline is not an accident, but 
a law. 
Thus the Republic becomes a party to the movement. Without doubt this is a 
temporary state. The fruitful seed of culture, the increase of knowledge, the mental 
equilibrium which comes from knowledge, the more perfect education of the citizens; 
the economic emancipation of women, before whom now open other careers than that 
of marriage and who have thus liberty of choice; all this is noble and grand, but for 
the time the first difficulty that confronts us is seen at once in the statistics which 
enable us to count, one by one, the losses in the number of candidates for teachers’ 
positions. 
The decline in the attendance upon the normal schools and the 
growing discontent of the body of the teachers are signs of what 
was termed by a senator “the crisis of the personnel of primary 
education, a crisis at once moral and economic.” The actual decline 
   
-P-A-G-E-844
  790 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
in the number of candidates for the normal schools is not great; in 
the case of the schools for men the number fell from 4,684 in 1905 to 
3,849 in 1911, and in the case of schools for women, from 7,949 in 
1907 to 7,445 in 1911; but it is a steady falling off, and the hope of 
a countermovement through the prospect of better salaries has been 
disappointed by the fact that the appropriations approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies have not yet materialized. This failure 
increases the unrest among the teachers which was excited last year 
by the order for the suppression of their associations. 
Alarm is also caused by the increasing difficulty in enforcing and 
extending the compulsory school-attendance law. This law covers 
the period 6 to 13 years of age, but it is not rigidly enforced and 
exemption can be secured at 12 years of age by passing the leaving 
certificate examination. The absorbing questions of the year, ques- 
tions discussed in Parliament, in the journals, in educational associa- 
tions, relate to the two essential conditions: The continued efficiency 
of the teaching force and the improvement of school attendance. 
THE HIGHER PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
France was one of the first nations in Europe to make provision 
for extending the education of the common people beyond the mere 
rudiments, with special reference to their industrial needs. For this 
purpose two classes of schools have been established: Higher primary 
schools and practical schools of commerce and industry. In the 
former the studies of the elementary primary schools are extended 
with special reference to vocational training; the latter are essentially 
vocational. The necessity of such provision was foreseen by Guizot; 
and the law of 1833, which bears his name, authorized the establish- 
ment of higher primary schools, but outside of a few cities which 
had already organized such schools the law had little effect. In 
1878 the General Government appropriated $22,000 to aid com- 
munes in establishing schools of this order; the amount has been 
augmented from year to year and has proved a stimulus to local 
effort. Complications soon arose, however, from the endeavor to 
include in the same category schools for general instruction and a 
class of schools, industrial or commercial in character (écoles pro- 
fessionnelles), that had been established in a few cities. Various 
experiments were tried in the endeavor to harmonize the claims of 
the general and special courses of instruction, and finally in 1892, a 
law was passed establishing two different classes of schools, i. e., 
higher primary schools, and practical schools of commerce and indus- 
try, under separate administrations. 
The higher primary schools have remained under the ministry of 
public instruction, and are supported by the combined action, of the 
State and the communes. The State assumes the legal salaries of the
-P-A-G-E-845
FRANCE. 791 
regular staff, which amounts to about five-sevenths of the total 
salaries required to maintain the full complement of teachers. The 
municipality (commune) must pay the salaries of teachers in charge 
of the workshop and also of the persons employed as technical and 
industrial teachers. 
The expense for buildings, furniture, apparatus, etc., must also be 
met by the commune. : 
Although the higher primary schools are established in each case 
by a particular commune or town, most of them draw pupils from 
the surrounding districts, and consequently they have boarding houses 
attached. These, like the school buildings, are furnished by the 
commune, and are sometimes managed by a burser (économe), who 
is an employee of the communal authorities; in general, however, in 
the provinces the director of a higher primary school manages the 
boarding department also. ~ About half the higher primaries for boys 
and the two-thirds of those for girls have boarding departments. In 
other words, France has a system of communal boarding schools with 
the staff of each supplied at the expense of the State. In these 
schools tuition is free, and the State assists in bringing them within 
the reach of poor, but promising, youths by a system of scholarships 
covering living expenses. Similar funds are also provided by depart- 
ments and communes. 
The system of higher primary schools is excellent in theory, and 
the schools themselves, as a rule, thoroughly efficient, but they reach 
only a small proportion of the children, as appears from the enroll- 
ment. The following table includes the higher primary schools, the 
practical schools of commerce and industry, and the four State 
schools of the same general order, which are intended as models illus- 
trating the highest theory of education adapted to the industrial 
classes.

   From every point of view it is seen that primary education in 
France is facing a crisis. The period of enthusiasm which marked 
the early years of the Republic and the period of struggle between 
church and state which followed have passed. New interests have 
developed, demanding new adjustments and purposes in primary 
education. The call for a radical change in methods and aims has 
been sounded by the Ligue de l’Enseignement, an association founded 
in 1870 by Jean Macé, and which has ever since been the source and 
motive power in educational reform. 
At the congress of this society held in August of the current year at 
Aix-les-Bains, it was declared that France has depended too much 
upon laws, regulations, and penalties for Carrying out the compulsory 
attendance requirements, without regard to the causes that lead to 
irregularity; among these are the necessities of life, the increased cost 
of living, the decline of hand work, and the exodus of the peasants 
from the country to the city. To offset these influences an effort 
must be made to adapt school programs, time tables, and the eatire 
conduct of the school to the economic and industrial conditions of the 
individual community. ‘The school for life, the school for the 
community’’—this was the formula, the rallying ery adopted by the 
congress. This action marks a break in the deadening uniformity of 
the French primary schools. It was resolved by the congress, how- 
ever, that the new purposes do not require the destruction of the 
school system as it was organized by the preceding generation, but 
simply its adaptation to present conditions. It would suffice for the 
central authority to issue a minimum program, which should be 
obligatory and taught during the morning hours, and to leave the 
afternoon session for studies and practical work appropriate to each 
locality. Furthermore, it was advised that twice every week the whole 
rural population should be invited to the school to receive instruction, 
in matters of practical concern in their daily lives. As one member 
of the congress, M. de Monzie, said in the closing address: 
This is not revolution, but evolution; the beginning of a great reform which follows 
the law of progress, the supreme law in a democracy. 
The association of women teachers has emphasized the call for 
reform by specific demands. The following is the substance of the 
resolutions bearing on the subject which were adopted at the con- 
gress of the association held August 16-18 in the city of Bordeaux: 
Coeducation— Resolved, That the associations of women should 
adhere to the principles of coeducation and that concerted action 
should be taken with reference to measures necessary to secure the 
cooperation of the public authorities in this effort;
-P-A-G-E-847
  
FRANCE. 793 
With this end in view the executive committee of the federation is 
instructed to arrange for conferences, articles in the public press, and 
local meetings for the purpose of increasing the number of supporters 
and defenders of this policy, in order that the text of the education 
law of October 30, 1886, may be amended in such a way that it will no 
longer be left to a municipal council opposed to this policy to prevent 
the establishment of mixed schools or the transformation of existing 
separate schools into mixed schools; 
That women teachers should no longer be assigned wholly to the 
lower classes of the schools. 
Equality of salaries.—Having in view the recent act of Parliament 
reducing somewhat the difference between the salaries of women and 
men teachers, this federation expresses its appreciation of the work 
of the committee of the Chamber of Deputies which secured this 
action, but regrets that the full principle of equality of salaries was 
not sanctioned by a formal vote of Parliament; finally, the federation 
resolves that the Government shall be urged to include in the esti- 
mates for 1914 the sums necessary for securing equality of salaries 
for women teachers on the one side and the men teachers on the other, 
in all classes of primary schools, viz, primary, higher primary, and 
normal. 
Inspection service for women.—The congress, considering that there 
are in France only five inspectresses of primary instruction, and only 
nine Departments which are provided with inspectresses of infant 
schools (écoles maternelles) as authorized by law, and further that 
it is for the interests of the women teachers of France to oppose the 
idea that they are not competent for administrative services in con- 
nection with schools for girls and infant schools, therefore resolved: 
That the minister of public instruction be urged to appoint inspec- 
tresses of primary education and inspectresses of infant schools in all 
the Departments. 
Women on educational commissions.—In the belief that men, no 
matter how able they may be, have not all the qualifications neces- 
sary for determining the conduct of schools for girls and of infant 
schools, and to secure in the highest possible degree the well-being 
of the pupils in such schools, this congress resolves: 
That the minister of public instruction be urged to request the 
departmental prefects to propose for appointment to the local school 
committees at least two women in each case. 
That the number of women should be greatly increased in the 
membership of school committees, in the administration of the local 
school funds, in the administration of municipal school colonies and 
vacation schools, in the committees appointed for the purchase and 
supervision of public libraries.
-P-A-G-E-848
794 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
This congress also adopted an important resolution in favor of 
woman suffrage, pledging support of the organization in efforts’ to 
secure the speedy passage of a bill already introduced in the Parlia- 
ment, extending to women the right to vote in municipal and can- 
tonal elections, and to be nominated as candidates in those elections. 
The association itself by the union-in a single body of primary 
teachers and professors of secondary schools is promoting the con- 
sciousness of a common purpose in the different orders of instruction. 
FAVORING CONDITIONS. 
Under the rigid organization of the French system of public instruc- 
tion, new adjustments are more difficult than in a flexible system 
like that of the United States. In spite, however, of the all-pervading 
officialism, French schools are saved from dead formality by the lively 
spirit of the teachers and the dramatic impulses of both teachers and 
pupils. A little theater is no uncommon adjunct of even humble 
schools, and in these the associations of former pupils (the Pétites 
Amicales) meet for mutual helpfulness and recreation; here they 
declaim extracts from their classic poets, and with the aid of the 
pupils of to-day enact improvised scenes or even complete dramas. 
It should be considered also that the conditions of industry in 
France prevent in a measure the extreme evils of early withdrawal 
from school. Although a fraction of the children who escape this 
obligation while still very young become mere vagabonds or even 
criminals, the majority go to work at the industries of their parents, 
manual or agricultural, as the case may be. In Paris, and all the 
large cities, hand industries still thrive, and the craftsman’s home is 
also his shop; in the country the great estates have given place to small 
farms in the hands of peasant owners. It is estimated that there are 
more small holdings of land in France than in Germany, England, 
and Austria combined. The artisan of the cities and the peasant 
proprietors are proverbially thrifty and frugal, and it is the savings 
of these classes, received and controlled by three or four banking com- 
panies, that have given France its financial predominance in Europe. 
Economy and frugality are native habits practiced in every humble 
household in France. The school lessons on these modest virtues 
simply enforce the living example of the home. This practical spirit 
of the French people insures support for a reform movement as soon 
as its economic promise is revealed to them. 
PROVISION FOR ADULT EDUCATION. 
The unsatisfactory state of primary education at the present time 
is offset by the vigor of the movement for adult education. This 
work has been fostered by various agencies which were organized in 
1894 under the direction of Edouard Petit, inspector general of public 
instruction, who brought to the effort great administrative ability
-P-A-G-E-849
FRANCE. 795 
and contagious enthusiasm. The report of M. Petit for 1912-13, 
the nineteenth in the series, gives abundant ground for the confident 
spirit by which it is animated. From the statistical summary 
presented, it appears that the number of evening classes conducted 
during the year reached a total of 54,493 (82,159 for young men and 
22,234 for young women), an increase of nearly 2,000 classes over the 
previous year. The number of persons in attendance upon ‘these 
classes was 644,306. Cf the entire number of classes, 6,000 were 
maintained by societies for popular instruction, chambers of com- 
merce, etc. The number of popular lectures comprised in the work 
reached a total of 61,027. In addition to the classes for systematic 
instruction and the popular lectures, an effort is made to promote 
the spirit of solidarity and helpfulness among the people. To this 
end, societies called Mutualités Scolaires are formed. These consist 
of former pupils of the local schools and members drawn from the 
wealthier classes who are interested in the welfare of their commu- 
nities. The mutualités comprise altogether 874,859 paying mem- 
bers, and during the current year contributed more than 5,000,000 
francs ($1,000,000) for benevolent purposes. In addition, the 
movement comprises 6,587 associations of former pupils, “petites A” 
(1,995 for young women and 4,592 for young men), with a total of 
700,000 members. 'To the number of these societies should be added 
2,000 maintained for athletic sports, or military exercises. 
The work of instruction by means of classes and popular lectures is 
largely carried on by the teachers of the primary schools, assisted in 
many sections by the professors of secondary schools and univer- 
sities. The number of primary teachers giving their services to this 
cause during the year was 81,553, and the number of collaborators, 
not engaged in the schools, 13,710. 'The report calls special atten- 
tion to the extended use of the cinematograph in the lectures and 
to the growing demand for systematized courses of instruction in 
civic affairs and social hygiene. An interesting development from 
this work is the formation of what are termed patronages; that is, 
Jocal societies pledged to look after the welfare of the children of 
their respective communities. These societies maintain créches, 
where mothers obliged to work can leave their infant children safely, 
and workshops in which the pupils of the public schools receive 
manual instruction on Thursday and Sunday when the schools are 
not in session. 
The work of adult education covered by the report of M. Petit is 
purely secular, and therefore encounters opposition from the forces 
opposed to the public schools. Hence, it rallies to their support, or 
as expressed by M. Petit: 
This organization defends the school, supports its influence over the pupils during 
and after the school age. By the side of the defense of the law, which is a matter for
-P-A-G-E-850
796 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the legislature, it establishes defense by private initiative, which is the business of 
citizens. 
The opinion is expressed by the leaders in this work that the time 
has come when it should receive support from the Government. 
The Ligue de l’ Enseignement, at its annual meeting for 1912, renewed 
the resolution which has been adopted for 10 successive years, to the 
effect that a systematic organization of the classes and lectures 
should be substituted for the voluntary activities which have to be 
worked up each summer, and that the legislature, in any measure 
adopted for prolonging the period of obligatory education, should 
include secondary education for the masses. 
It was urged by the Ligue that measures should be adopted oblig- 
ing apprentices to follow technical courses of instruction, and that 
the time required for this purpose should be included in the number 
of hours allowed by law for the working day. Thus it appears that 
opinion in France has reached the same stage as in England, in which 
a similar demand is made upon Parliament, coupled with the proviso 
that employers shall continue the wages of apprentices during the 
years of training. 
PROMOTION OF MORAL EDUCATION. 
A second movement of great significance relates to the promotion 
of the moral development of the people through the agency of the 
schools. The widespread interest in this subject, manifested by two 
international congresses, is largely due to the activity of French lead- 
ers, who have succeeded also in organizing an association of the forces 
interested in that purpose. This society, La Ligue Francaise d’Edu- 
cation Morale, has recently received a donation of 15,000 francs 
($3,000) for the promotion of prize contests for the preparation of a 
manual of moral education embodying the principles of the society. 
As set forth in the first article of its by-laws, these principles are as 
follows: 
This association was founded at Paris under the title La Ligue Frangaise d’Educa- 
tion Morale, independently of all parties—political, philosophical, religious—with the 
express object of promoting moral education by the spread of principles universally 
recognized as essential in the conduct of individuals and to the life of society. 
Determined to observe religious neutrality and to reserve to each of its members 
entire liberty of opinion, the Ligue will spread those moral ideas upon which there is 
sufficient agreement to make possible the collaboration of all right-minded people. 
In order to apply these principles to the moral education of both sexes under various 
social conditions, and in particular in school relations, this society will endeavor to 
discover the best methods of forming character, of developing the spirit of solidarity, 
and of strengthening the idea and the sentiment of duty. 
In a public appeal for support, the Ligue declares its belief that 
whatever may be the differences in religious or philosophical doctrines 
by which individuals come to the conception of a universal moral
-P-A-G-E-851
  FRANCE. 197 
order, these differences have never prevented candid minds from un- 
derstanding what is meant by an ‘‘honest man.” In the language of 
the appeal— 
The.entire world is unanimous in the conviction that integrity, propriety, courage, 
respect for one’s self and his neighbor, devotion to one’s country and to humanity, 
are precious virtues, and that it is necessary to oppose at any price degradation of 
manners, egotism; brutal passions, alcoholic indulgences—in short, all the powers of 
corruption that threaten democratic societies. 
The prizes offered for the proposed manual are as follows: 
The first prize of 5,000 francs for the best article on the subject. 
The sum of 5,000 francs to be divided between three manuscripts, classed imme- 
diately aiter the best. 
A sum of 5,000 francs to be divided in prizes of various value from 200 to 500 francs 
according to the judgment of the jury respecting manuscripts placed in a third class. 
This competition is open to all persons interested in the practical 
problem of moral education, and particularly to all teachers of both 
public and private schools. 
The jury to decide upon the manuscripts comprises many of the 
most eminent men in France. Its president is M. A. Ribot, of the 
French Academy. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
CONSERVATIVE FORCES. 
Secondary and higher education are closely related as regards 
scholastic purposes, the secondary schools preparing students for the 
specialized courses of the universities. The two departments are, 
however, separately administered, and the changing demands of 
modern life have affected the secondary schools even more deeply 
than they have the universities. Under the pressure of these de- 
mands it is impossible to continue the exclusiveness of secondary 
education and its remoteness from current affairs. At the same time 
France has more reason than any other country for maintaining clas- 
sical studies and the ideals of culture which they inspire. It is the 
discipline of the humanities carried to its highest perfection in the 
schools of France that has determined the characteristics of the na- 
tional art and literature, the unity, proportion, and esthetic finish 
which are the admiration of all other nations. 
The diploma of secondary education has also been required for 
admission to official posts, and consequently the aptitudes which the 
old system developed accord with the general tone and requirements 
of these services; thus what may be termed the usages of state- 
craft favor the retention of the established course of secondary 
studies. On the other hand, the industrial applications of science 
and the vast commercial interests of modern life necessitate a change 
of emphasis in the curriculum of schools from which the nation 
draws its directive forces and its power of initiative for either public 
affairs or industrial enterprises. 
 
-P-A-G-E-852
798 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
THE PROGRAM OF 1902. 
The program of secondary studies authorized by a law of 1901 
embodies the new conception of secondary education. Classical 
studies which had dominated the former programs were placed on a 
level with modern languages and the sciences, and the endeavor was 
thus made to comprise new orders of instruction within the insti- 
tutions that had long been devoted to the humanities. This 
experiment, it will be seen, differs radically from the course pursued in 
surrounding countries, especially in Switzerland and Germany. In 
these nations there have been created side by side with the gymnasia, 
or classical schools, modern schools (higher realschulen, real pro- 
gymnasia), etc. 
The French experiment has naturally been watched with great 
interest; but, although ten years have elapsed since the change went 
into effect, it is still difficult to judge of its value. Complications 
have also arisen by the development of the higher primary schools in 
certain places, which, although bearing the name ‘‘primary,’’ are 
often modern secondary schools of high grade. 
CURRENT CRITICISMS. 
In submitting the e ‘ucation budget for 1913 to the Chamber of 
Deputies the chairman of the committee, M. Viviani, calls attention 
to the fact that the discussion continues in.respect to the direction of 
secondary education, and that scarcely a week passes without some 
severe criticism of the new system. He says: 
It is the fashion to-day to publish the results of certain examinations and official 
investigations which expose all the defects of the candidates, and then to declare that 
people no longer learn to write and compose, and that even spelling is neglected. 
Nevertheless this is a dangerous game, this judging by the reports of a few investiga- 
tions or examinations. An abundant harvest could be gathered from the same sort 
of reports, in which, in the very same terms, the inspectors for a time long preceding 
1902 dwelt upon the failure of students. 
In respect to the repeated declaration that the study of Latin is 
falling into decay, M. Viviani continues: 
It is nine years since the reform programs were adopted. But never under the 
ancient régime did the Latin classes contain more pupils than are found to-day in 
sections A, having Latin and Greek; section B, Latin and modern languages; and 
section ©, Latin and sciences. This last section, it is true, attracts the greater number 
of the pupils, but this is cause of satisfaction, for in contact with Latin and sciences the 
young mind is opened at once to the works of imagination and of reason. 
It is asserted by many critics of the present system that the results 
of Latin and Greek are mediocre in the highest classes, that French 
has not gained anything from the diminution of Latin and Greek, and 
that the sciences and mathematics are weak or superficial. But in the 
opinion of M. Viviani these conditions indicate too much haste in
-P-A-G-E-853
  
FRANCE. 799 
the lower classes and the endeavor to cover too much ground, rather 
than defects in the plan of studies. The difficulty arises, he says, 
“from the struggle between quality, which was formerly the main 
thought, and the quantity of the matters now brought to the atten- 
tion of the student.” He reminded the Chamber of Deputies that 
while ‘‘the reform of 1902 was not necessarily final, it has the same 
right as other reforms to claim time for experience.” Meariwhile it 
must be allowed that this reform ‘‘has made no effort to exploit itself 
at the expense of classical instruction, of which the intrinsic beauty 
was never in question, but whose adequacy for modern requirements 
was manifest.” 
COMMISSION OF INQUIRY. 
The great importance of the subject is indicated by the appoint- 
ment of a parliamentary commission which is engaged in an exhaus- 
tive inquiry as to the working of the new program. Evidence is 
sought from parents, men of affairs, and business men, and in this 
wide scope the inquiry merges into the broader question of a reorgan- 
ization of the entire system of public instruction. 
A RADICAL PROPOSITION. 
The plan of a unified national school is now before the Chamber of 
Deputies in a bill introduced by M. Ferdinand Buisson. The pro- 
fessed intention of the bill is to establish equality of opportunity for 
all children. For this purpose its author would put an end to the 
dualism of the existing system which provides one kind of school 
for the masses and another for those favored of fortune, and substitute 
“the national school,” organized in three cycles. 
In the plan outlined by M. Buisson, the first cycle is devoted to 
elementary primary education to be given uniformly to all children 
5 to 11 years of age; the second cycle is for children from 11 to 14 
years of age; in this cycle the education will be varied according to 
the requirements or aptitudes of the pupils, but in spite of these 
pedagogic differences perfect social equality will be maintained; in 
the third cycle education will be distinctively vocational (profes- 
sionnelle), the term being used in the widest sense. 
The scheme revives projects that were sketched by the leaders of 
the early days of the French Revolution, before its sanguinary 
extremes, and it resembles in many particulars the ideals of national 
education proclaimed by the Liberal Party in England, and is similar 
in principle to the movement for the “ Einheit school’ in Germany. 
Naturally M. Buisson does not anticipate any immediate action 
respecting the proposition. He has simply adopted the surest 
means of exciting public interest and discussion in regard to the 
subject.t

THE UNIVERSITIES. 
The universities, in common with the primary schools, are suffering 
from the delay on the part of the Government in providing for 
extensions whose importance is fully recognized. Increased appro- 
priations are greatly needed for laboratory equipments, both for the 
faculties of science and of medicine; although the Government has 
expended during the last 40 years a large sum, amounting to $20,- 
000,000, for the installation of laboratories, their equipment has not 
kept pace with this initial expenditure. This fact was urged upon 
the attention of the Chamber of Deputies by the chairman of the 
appropriation committee, who reminded that body that while 
foreign students were attracted to the faculties of iaw and letters 
by the fame of their professors, their lucid presentation of general 
ideas, and their talent for synthesis, the faculties of science could 
not compete with those of Germany and other neighboring countries 
by reason of their meager equipment. In respect to medical facul- 
ties, the need of fuller equipments and of the extension of courses of 
instruction in many important directions is recognized by the Goy- 
ernment as well as by the medical profession. In 1912 a commission 
was appointed for the special investigation of- the needs of this 
department, but so far no practical results have been accomplished 
by this body. The delay in these matters is apparently due to the 
increased military expenditures necessitated by the general uncer- 
tainty of European policies. . 
FRENCH INSTITUTES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
The chief events of the current year in the department of higher 
education pertain to measures by which the university leaders of 
France are seeking to maintain a sort of intellectual dominion in 
the world. This is the purpose of the French institutes established 
in foreign countries under the auspices of different universities. 
The University of Grenoble led in this work by opening an institute 
at Florence, the University of Nancy followed with an institute at 
St. Petersburg, and within a year a third institute has been opened 
at Madrid by the combined action of the Universities of Bordeaux 
~and Toulouse, and one at London under the auspices of the Uni- 
versity of Lille. 
The French Institute at Madrid, Spain, was inaugurated in Easter 
week, 1913. The importance of the event was emphasized by the 
presence of distinguished representatives of the universities of both 
countries, and the ceremonies were presided over by M. Steeg, 
former minister of public instruction, who was present as the official 
delegate of the French Government. Numerous festivities enlivened 
the more formal exercises, and the memory of the event will be per-
-P-A-G-E-855
  FRANCE. 801 
petuated by a special volume to be published by the French uni- 
versities. The keynote of all the addresses and ceremonies was the 
spirit of Latin fraternity which inspired the thought of the institute, 
and from which important results, both for Spain and for France, . 
are predicted. These anticipations rest upon the historic evidences 
of the common origin of many institutions characteristic of both 
countries. One great purpose of the institute is to promote researches 
in respect to these origins, by means of the archives, museums, and 
libraries of Spain. The importance of the facilities thus opened to 
French savants was dwelt upon by Dr. Paul Lapie, rector of the 
académie of Toulouse, who delivered the opening address at the 
inaugural. 
Dr. Lapie also discussed the opportunities afforded by the new 
institution for the study of the Romance languages and literature, 
subjects which are specially cultivated in the universities of southern 
France. In regard to the réle of a professor of living languages he 
reminded his hearers that it is no longer sufficient to study the idiom 
of a language by the aid of books. In this connection he said: 
A living language can not be found in the printed page; it is the language spoken 
by living people, among whom it is necessary to live in order to comprehend the 
thoughts and sentiments that animate the words. A professor of Spanish ought to 
teach not only words, but the things that pertain to Spain. He is not simply a man 
who can pronounce correctly the j and can discern the difference between para and 
por; he should be rather a man who has a love for Spain, who is familiar with its various 
Provinces, and who brings to his class, as it were, its atmosphere and brilliance, 
Neither at Bordeaux nor at Toulouse is it possible for our students to come fully under 
the Spanish influence. In order that they should become true professors of the 
Spanish language, it is necessary that they should leave their native land and enter 
the classes of their colleagues beyond the mountains and make long pilgrimages to 
the Cathederal of Toledo and the Museum of Prado. 
This idea, entertained at Bordeaux and Toulouse as far back as 
1896, gave rise to the Bulletin Hispanique, and later led the admin- 
istration to provide for a permanent work of research and excavations 
in Spain. Step by step these relations have been extended, and 
finally have culminated in the institute at Madrid. 
The French Institute at London is the outcome of plans formed 
at the University of Lille, and cordially seconded by the Université 
des Lettres Frangaises already established at London, and which 
assigned spacious quarters to the new institute in its own building, 
the Marble Arch House. 
The preliminary announcement of the institute at London states 
that it is organized in three departments: The first of these is intended 
to impart general information in regard to French life, policies, and 
literature by means chiefly of lectures. The second department is 
intended for the instruction of English professors of the French 
17726°—xp 1913—vor 1—_51
-P-A-G-E-856
  802 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
language, for which purpose systematic courses in grammar, conver- 
sation, literature, etc., will be offered. The third department is 
devoted to commercial interests and will provide courses of instruc- 
tion and general information pertaining to commercial affairs, and in 
addition, will serve as a place of meeting and an advisory office for 
young Frenchmen employed by commercial houses in London. 
Measures for establishing similar relations with the Latin American 
countries are the latest outcome of this international activity on 
the part of the French universities. So far no institutes have been 
opened in these countries, but various organizations have been formed 
looking toward this final result. Striking proof of the vigor of the 
international movement is afforded by the number of organizations 
engaged in the work. The following list includes only those having 
either a national character or represented by special organizations 
in the principal university towns of France. 
Various organizations and institutions maintained by the French for the propagation of 
the French language and culture in foreign lands. 
Comités de Patronage des Etudiants Etrangers.—Local; founded in connection with 
the different universities. Besides welcoming foreign students and doing every- 
thing necessary to make their stay as pleasant and profitable as possible, they help in 
arranging for special courses suited to the needs of foreigners and also maintain gen- 
eral and vacation courses especially for foreign students. They publish a wide 
variety of announcements, annuals, etc. 
Alliance Frangaise.—Association pour la propagation de la langue Francaise & 
V’Etranger et dans les colonies. Has 50,000 members and 450 branches. Publishes 
an annual and a great variety of circulars and announcements. 
Special institutes.—Institut Frangais de Florence, Italy; Institut Francais de Saint-

Latine.—Maintains a special library; publishes a monthly bulletin, and edits books 
and other publications having to do with Latin-American affairs. Published last 
May in Spanish a volume containing 354 pages, entitled “Las Universidades y Grandes 
Escuelas de Francia.”’ 
Comité France-Amérique.—A large and very important organization. Publishes a 
monthly bulletin. 
Office National des Universités et Ecoles frangaises, founded in 1910; has for one of 
its purposes that of acquainting foreigners with educational facilities offered by 
France and with the various committees and societies which look after the interests 
of foreign students.

These societies and associations, although founded in the interest 
of all students, French and foreign, contribute more or less to the 
propagation of the French language and culture by the special pro- 
visions they make for foreign students, by encouraging and aiding 
in the maintenance of special courses for the benefit of foreign stu- 
dents and by encouraging and aiding in the maintenance of special 
vacation courses and schools for their benefit. They publish and cir- 
culate general and special announcements, booklets descriptive of 
the different institutions with which they are connected and the spe- 
cial courses offered, and some of them publish rather elaborate 
annuals. 
AN EMINENT EDUCATOR. 
France has suffered great loss in the death of Dr. Jules-Gabriel 
Compayré, who was not only eminent as a university teacher and 
administrator, but achieved world-wide distinction by his contribu- 
tions to the literature of education. He was a graduate of the 
Ecole Normale Supérieure, and began his professional career in the 
lycées of Poitiers and Toulouse, and in 1874 was appointed professor 
of philosophy in the faculty of Toulouse. He quitted this post in 
1881 for political activities and was elected deputy, in which capacity 
he served until 1889, when he withdrew from politics and was soon 
after appointed rector of the University of Lyon, which is second 
only to the University of Paris. 
As an author Dr. Compayré is perhaps most widely known by his 
Histoire des Doctrines de l’Education, which was published in 1879, 
and which has been translated into several languages and has passed 
through numerous editions. He contributed important works to the 
psychology of childhood and youth, among these L’Evolution Intel- 
lectuelle et Morale de l’Enfant, which has also been translated into 
English. His last contribution to educational literature is a series 
of books upon the great educators, which are marked by discrimina- 
ting judgment and philosophical analysis. He continued his literary 
labors almost to the hour of his death, which occurred on the 23d 
of March of the current year. Dr. Compayré was naturally held in 
high esteem by American educators, for he did more than any other 
French writer to interpret the spirit of American institutions to his 
countrymen and to familiarize them with the work of American 
educators. 
STATISTICAL SUMMARY. 
The administration of public instruction in France is centralized 
in a cabinet officer, the minister of public instruction and fine arts. 
Education is organized in three departments: Primary, secondary, 
 
-P-A-G-E-858
  
804 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
and superior, each under a director who is second only to the minister 
in authority. 
For purposes of local administration France is divided into 17 
academies, each of which comprises a university, or university facul- 
ties, and a definite number of secondary schools, lycées, and colleges, 
under the general direction of the rector or chief of the academy, 
who is responsible to the minister of public instruction. The depart- 
ments, which are civil districts, form areas within the academies for 
the administration of primary schools. The immediate direction of 
' the latter is committed to academic inspectors. 
Official reports covering operations of each department of education 
are issued periodically; reports pertaining to primary education ap- 
pear at intervals of five years. The last report of this series 
brought the record to the close of the scholastic year 1906-7. Re- 
ports pertaining to secondary and to higher education are published 
at longer intervals. The only official publication summarizing sta- 
tistics respecting the entire system is the Statistical Annual issued by 
the minister of labor. From this source the following statistics are 
mainly derived: * 
STATISTICS OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
The department of primary education includes infant schools, which 
in France, as in England, are part of the public-school provision; ele- 
mentary primary schools which cover the period of obligatory at- 
tendance, ages 6-13 years; higher primary schools covering the ages 
12 to 15 or 13 to 16; and primary normal schools.

From Table 1 it will be seen that the total enrollment in the pri- 
mary schools for the year named was 5,654,794. 
A certain portion of the population depend upon the preparatory 
departments of secondary schools (lycées and colleges) for the ele- 
mentary instruction of their children. These divisions.in 1911 com- 
prised 39,896 pupils, which, added to the number in primary schools, 
gives a total enrollment of 5,694,690 pupils in elementary schools, 
or divisions above the infant grade. This total is equivalent to 14.4 
per cent of the population, a ratio relatively the same as the higher 
ratios in neighboring countries in which the child population exceeds 
that of France. 
Expenditure for primary schools—The current expenditure for pri- 
mary schools, which is borne almost entirely by the State, amounted 
in 1910 to 216,937,826 frances ($43,387,565), equivalent to $7.68 per 
capita of enrollment. The commune provides the site for a school 
and the school buildings, the State advancing money when necessary 
to assist in the latter work. The commune also provides residence 
for the head teacher of a school or a money equivalent, and is legally 
required to maintain a fund (caisse des écoles) for furnishing: aid, 
i. e., food and clothing for destitute children of school age.

STATISTICS OF PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
To the department of secondary education pertain the State 
lycées and the communal colleges for boys, all of which follow the 
official program adopted in 1902. The colleges do not always offer 
the full classical course, and the students who desire to secure the 
bachelor’s diploma for either one of the four parallel courses 
generally complete the same at one of the lycées of their own academic 
division or even at Paris. The State lycées and the local colleges for 
girls are separately administered and have a special curriculum.

STATISTICS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The department of higher education comprises the universities, 
16 in number, university schools, and special schools under the minis- 
ter of public instruction. The universities form the crown of the 
academic systems, and although they secured a measure of independ- 
ence by the law of 1896, they are State institutions, subject to

official control and deriving their main support from State subsidies. 
The academic rector is the virtual chief of the university within his 
jurisdiction. The universities are situated at the chief cities of their 
respective academies and are named from these. In the following 
table the schools not forming part of a university organization are 
indicated by stars.

SWITZERLAND. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Switzerland has not only given to the world great leaders of edu- 
cational reform, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and Pére Girard, but it has 
given also striking examples of the adaptation of education to the 
practical needs of a people. The system of technical schools main- 
tained by the combined action of communities and the Federal 
Government has been fully explained in recent reports of this office. 
The following statements relate to the commercial schools and 
schools of agriculture, which bear also an important part in main- 
taining, in the Republic, a high standard of industrial efficiency. 
COMMERCIAL SCHOOLS. 
Continuation schools, including schools for general education, 
trade and commercial schools, are maintained in all the Cantons of 
Switzerland, and are supported by local authorities, with aid from the 
Federal Government. The following information, received from the 
United States consul at St. Gall, summarizes particulars respecting 
the different classes of commercial schools in 1912; corresponding 
particulars for 1911 are given also in parentheses: 
SWISS FEDERAL GRANTS TO COMMERCIAL EDUCATION FOR THE YEAR 1912. 
The commercial school in Switzerland continues to gain in importance. In wide 
circles of the population there is a conviction that a scholastic and special training, 
added to general culture, is calculated to improve the prospects of advancement. 
By means of grants, the Federal Government aims at raising the standard of com- 
mercial-school education, and directs its efforts toward enabling Switzerland to hold 
her own against the keen competition of the foreigner. 
The contribution from the Federation may amount, according to circumstances, to as 
much as half of the sums subscribed yearly by the Cantons, districts, corporations, and 
private persons; these Federal contributions must, however, entail no diminution of 
the sums previously paid by the Cantons, districts, etc. 
The total Government grants for commercial education in 1912 amounted to $212,696, 
an increase of $27,131 over 1911, when the amount was $185,565. 
The various grades and number of schools, attendance, and Government grants 
received last year are as follows: 
(1) Commercial high schools, 6 in all, located at St. Gall, Berne, Fribourg, Zurich, 
Neuenburg, and Lausanne; operating expenses, $55,095 (1911—$35,542); number of 
pupils, 397 male, 16 female, total, 413 (1911—338); school fees collected, $4;743 
(1911—$3,582); Government grant, $16,055 (1911—$10,172).
-P-A-G-E-863
  SWITZERLAND. 809° 
(2) Commercial schools, 35 in all (in 1911 there were but 31); total operating expenses, 
$386,544 (1911—$347,373); number of pupils, 2,737 male, 1,670 female, total, 4,407 
(1911—3,986); school fees collected, $60,352 (1911—$57,287); Government grant, 
$105,438 (1911—$93, 660). 
(3) Administration schools.—These schools, which especially prepare young men and 
women for the Federal post, telegraph, telephone, and customs service, received a 
Government grant for the first time in 1911. 
There are four in all, located at St. Gall, Geneva, Biel, and Zurich; total operating 
expenditures, $31,474 (1911—$29,815); number of pupils, 329 male, 5 female, total, 334 
(in 1911 there were 360 pupils, all male); school fees collected, $1,533 (1911—$1,558); 
Government grant, $9,978 (1911—$9,346). 
(4) Mercantile secondary schools.—To this class of institutions belong (a) 80 schools 
of the ‘‘Swiss Commercial Union,” the chief aim of which is the education of young 
tradesmen; the total operating expenses of this class of schools amounted in 1912 to 
$159,986 (1911—$140,728); pupils, male 8,719, female 2,549, total, 11,268 (1911—10,966); 
school fees collected, $34,964 (1911—$31,235); Government grants, $58,501 
(1911—$53,387); grants from Cantons, $28,216 (1911—$24,188); from districts, $21,356 
(1911—$19,416); from corporations, $11,891 (1911—$11,413); and (b) 40 other single 
associations and district secondary schools; total operating expenditures, $26,534 
(1911—$23,702); number of pupils, male 2,899, female 2,150, total, 5,049 (1911—4,613); 
school fees collected, $5,334 (1911—$5,426); grants from Government, $8,895 
(1911—$8,115); from Cantons, $5,397 (1911—$5,085); from districts, $4,187 (1911— 
$3,491); from corporations, $1,856 (1911—$1,008). 
For miscellaneous purposes there was expended $13,829 (1911—$10,885), among which 
was $5,223 (1911—$4,689) for scholarships; $2,299 (1911—$2,064) for apprenticeship 
examinations; $2,738 (1911—$1,786) for libraries and lectures.1 
AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS. 
The agricultural interests of Switzerland are as carefully promoted 
as those of trade and industry, and in several Cantons full provision 
is made for agricultural education. The following information per- 
taining to this interest is derived from a recent consular report on the 
subject: ? 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE. 
The total area of land in Switzerland utilized for agricultural purposes is 5,160,380 
acres, divided into 3,479,207 parcels of land. There are 252,496 farms, on which are 
employed 763,915 hands, of whom 21,596 are foreigners, 9,862 being Italians, 5,507 
Germans, 5,101 French, 854 Austrians, and the balance of other nationalities. 
Of the total Swiss population of 3,753,293, no less than 413 in every 1,000 are engaged 
in agriculture, while 387 are employed in the metal, textile, and chemical industries, 
118 in commerce, 47 in transportation, 17 in forestry, and 18 in the various other occu- 
pations. Switzerland must therefore still be ranked as an agricultural country. 
The foreign element.appears to have settled in the frontier Cantons almost exclu- 
sively. In the Canton of Geneva, adjoining France, for instance, statistics show that 
foreign farm hands, mostly French, constitute 38 per cent of agricultural laborers, 
while in some of the interior Cantons the foreign percentage is negligible. 
Only 2.6 per cent of Swiss farms use motor power, the entire horsepower being 
23,640.

-P-A-G-E-864
  810 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The Canton of St. Gall, with a population of about 303,000 and a total area of 769 
square miles, has 17,027 separate farms, covering 325,730 acres, the average size of 
holdings being a trifle over 19 acres. But only 20,255 acres, however, cain be said 
to be under any kind of cultivation, 6,257 acres being devoted to growing wheat, rye, 
barley, etc.; 1,139 acres are in vineyards and 410 acres in truck gardens; 34,199 acres 
in the Canton are forests, probably the finest in the world, and there are great areas 
of meadow land and pasturages. Climatic conditions and the peculiar nature of the 
soil are decidedly unfavorable to truck gardening, hence vegetables of all kinds 
have to be brought in from the outside, which fact is an important item in the high 
cost of living. 
Conditions are not as good in the adjoining Canton of Appenzell, the proportion of 
land suitable for any kind of farming being much less than in St. Gall. 
AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS. 
According to the report from which the foregoing statement is 
cited there are in eastern Switzerland, the German-speaking section 
of the Federation, nine agricultural schools under the supervision 
of the several cantonal governments. During the last year (1912) 
1,012 pupils were enrolled in these institutions, which impart a 
thorough and practical knowledge of scientific farming. Three of 
these schools, with 251 pupils, are located in the consular district of 
the writer, the most important one being at Rheineck, Canton of St.! 
Gall. It is in charge of a director, with three principal teachers and 
11 assistants, the pupils lodging and boarding in the establishment. 
There are two school terms per year, the winter term extending from 
November 1 to March 31, with 35 hours’ instruction per week, and 
the summer term the balance of the year, broken only by the usual 
vacations. 
The school offers general courses of instruction, including German, 
mathematics, surveying, planimetry, drawing, botany, zoology, 
physics, chemistry, geography of the Alps, and the constitution of 
Switzerland. 
The agricultural course is comprehensive. It includes, besides the 
sciences pertaining to agriculture and kindred industries, practical 
courses in farming, care of cattle, fruit growing, fertilizing processes, 
bee culture, building, bookkeeping, and the elementary principles of 
law relating to the sale of lands, transportation of products, ete. 
The summer season is largely devoted to visiting and inspecting 
large farms and dairies, with frequent descriptive lectures on appro- 
priate subjects. The school possesses an extensive analytical labo- 
ratory and an excellent library, and the students are frequently called 
upon by farmers and dairy owners throughout the surrounding 
country to advise regarding improvement of the soil, the planting 
and rotation of crops, the installation of machinery, etc., charges for 
such services ranging from $2 to $3 per day.
-P-A-G-E-865
  SWITZERLAND. 811 
The schools in Thurgau and Graubuenden are managed on lines 
almost identical with the one at Rheineck. The directors of the 
Thurgau establishment recently discussed the question of admitting 
women to the school, several women applicants having requested 
permission to follow the courses, especially those in fruit growing, 
vegetable gardening, and bee culture. The decision, however, was 
adverse to the admission of women. 
Agricultural schools are also in successful operation in other Can- 
tons, i. e., in Berne, with 275 pupils; in Zurich, with 181; Aargau, 
114; Lucerne, 112; Solothurn, 47; and Schaffhausen, 32.

PROGRESS IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS. 
According to an agreement of the heads of the statistical bureaus 
of the several German States, uniform statistics concerning the com- 
mon schools (Volksschulen) in the Empire have been compiled every 
five years since 1901. The latest compilation, published in 1912, 
brings the statistics for 1911 into comparison with those for 1901 
and 1906.1 
From a summary of the detailed statistics it appears that the com- 
mon schools of Germany were attended by over 10,000,000 pupils 
in 1911. The growth of primary education in the Empire in the first 
decade of the twentieth century can be seen from the following 
comparison: 
Public common schools ( Volksschulen).

  61, 587 | 148,217 39, 268 | 10,309,949 
| 
The Volksschulen correspond closely to the rural and the element- 
ary city schools of the United States. In the country they are very 
generally one-class schools in which boys and girls of all ages at which 
they must attend school are instructed together by the same teacher, 
In the different conditions of town life it has been found necessary to 
establish graded schools of different types and with more extended 
programs; so that besides the common school there are higher public 
schools which are variously named, as middle schools (Mittelschulen),

higher elementary schools, citizens schools, etc. They include the 
classes of an ordinary public school with two or three additional 
classes, making altogether a course of eight or nine years, in which 
one or more languages and elementary science are taught. The total 
enrollment in the public schools of this class in 1911 was 273,394, 
which, added to the enrollment in the Volksschulen, makes a grand 
total of 10,583,343 pupils. There were also 80,660 pupils in private 
schools of the intermediate order. 
The expenditures for the Volksschulen for the years included in 
the comparison were as follows:

  In some cases the expenditure for Mittelschulen is included in the 
total for Volksschulen. The amount reported separately for the 
former schools is 30,566,591 marks, equivalent to $7,274,849. This 
would raise the total expenditure for the public schools in 1911 to 
$166,696,055. 
Prussia, with a population of 40,165,219, or 61 per cent of the total 
for the Empire (census of 1910), enrolls in its Volksschulen 6,572,140 
pupils—that is, 63.7 per cent of the total enrollment; it employs 
116,239 teachers, or 62 per cent of the total teaching force (187,485); 
and in 1911 expended for these schools 420,898,120 marks, or 62.8 
per cent of the amount reported for the Empire. In respect to 
Mittelschulen the proportions for Prussia are still higher, namely, 
for pupils, 66 per cent of the total; for teachers, 75 per cent; and 
for expenditures, 84 per cent. 
The predominance of one-class schools is indicated by the fact that 
of 38,684 Volksschulen in Prussia 20,198 were of the type named. 
From the comparative statistics it appears that the enrollment in 
the Volksschulen has increased in the decade 15.8 per cent. This is 
little more than the increase in population, which, as shown by the 
censuses of 1900 and 1910, was 15 per cent. But in the decade 
covered by the school statistics the expenditure for the common 
schools increased by 59 per cent. This large advance was caused 
chiefly by improvements in the salaries of teachers, new buildings, 
and welfare services.
-P-A-G-E-869
  
GERMANY, 815 
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS. 
As regards teachers, two significant facts are brought out by the 
comparative statistics—the increase is relatively greater for women 
teachers than for men, while the number of teachers of both sexes has 
increased more rapidly than that of the pupils. In the year 1901 
there were 60.9 pupils to each teacher in the public common schools 
of Germany; in 1906, 58.4; and in 1911, 54.9. Although this shows 
a steady improvement, 54.9 pupils to one teacher is still considered 
excessive. In the larger States the number of pupils to each teacher 
was, in 1911, as follows: Prussia, 56.5; Bavaria, 56.7; Wurttemberg, 
57.8; and in the Kingdom of Saxony, 54.7. 
The averages above given conceal many extreme cases. It is 
admitted that the overcrowding of schools is everywhere encountered. 
The National Liberal Party in Prussia urged the budget committee 
of the Lower House to include in the estimates for public instruction 
for 1912 an appropriation sufficient to provide for the reduction of 
classes in the primary schools. It was estimated that upon a total 
of 6,500,000 pupils there were 1,219,000 in 7,396 overcrowded classes. 
This number comprised many classes having above 70 pupils; one 
case was cited of a single master charged with the instruction of 230 
pupils; several hundred schools, it was stated, had classes of 120 
pupils. i 
On the part of the Government it was declared that during the 
last 11 years the number of all congested classes had been greatly 
reduced; nevertheless, the recommendation of the committee was 
adopted by the House. 
OLD METHODS VERSUS NEW SYSTEMS. 
The overcrowding of schools illustrates, in a way, the method of 
German teaching. All the teachers are trained in a thorough system, 
and they handle their classes in a masterly manner, but with small 
regard to the individual. Notwithstanding the fact that modern 
psychology and the newer philosophies of education are most indebted 
to German thought and research, they have not yet greatly modified 
the methods of dealing with the young in that country. Even the 
unrest in German educational circles arises rather from discontent 
with social and economic conditions than from reaction against the 
established routine of the schools. 
It should be recalled, however, that two important experiments in 
the classification of elementary schools had their origin in Germany. 
The “‘Hilfsschule,” or auxiliary school for defective children, an 
experiment which was begun at Halle in 1859, has not only been 
adopted in Germany, but has spread to other continental countries, 
to Great Britain, and to the United States.
-P-A-G-E-870
  816 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
Asecond experiment, the ‘‘Mannheim system,” so called from the 
city in Baden in which it originated, while not extensively adopted 
has undoubtedly helped to bring about more flexible classification in 
elementary schools generally. Of this system a well-known American 
educator who has recently made personal investigation of its work- 
ing writes: 
The Mannheim system consists of dividing up the children in the common schools 
(Volksschule) into three groups of children. The highest group comprise the nor- 
mally capable children. The second, or middle group, are those who have fallen 
behind for various reasons and are a little subnormal for lack of ability, sickness, etc. 
The third group are the defectives. At about the end of the third year, or third 
grade, the children are divided up into these three classes, and a separate course of 
study is worked out suitable to the abilities of each grade, and each one rounded out 
to a complete course. The normal class, or more capable children, will be able to 
move on more rapidly, unobstructed by laggards and dull pupils. The middle class 
of children, being of about equal ability, are moved on more slowly and do their 
work more thoroughly and satisfactorily. The third class requires special skill and 
ability in the teachers and a method and subject matter suitable to their peculiarities 
or weaker powers. This appears to me as a very important effort to solve some 
serious problems in the organization of schools, and is a method of teaching better 
adapted to children’s different abilities.! 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The deepest movement pertaining to elementary education in 
Germany relates to vocational training. While this movement has 
been brought about by the irresistible force of competitive industry, 
it has given rise to a new conception of popular education as a means 
of awakening the social and civic consciousness, an idea expounded 
by Director Kerchensteiner, of Munich, and partially realized in that 
city. Although this conception, as a whole, has been opposed by 
the authorities in Prussia and other German States, it has attracted 
wide attention and promises to work great changes in the prevailing 
theories of elementary education. Without entering into this sub- 
ject, which has been quite fully considered in previous reports 
and bulletins of this office,? attention is here called to the recent 
progress and present status of the continuation schools. 
Compulsory measures.—The tendency to make attendance upon 
continuation schools compulsory is rapidly spreading in the States 
of the German Empire. In Bavaria, Baden, Wurttemberg, and 
Saxony attendance is compulsory for boys for a certain number of 
hours a week; in Prussia, towns are authorized to make such attend- 
ance compulsory, by local by-law, for all young people engaged in

industrial and commercial occupations. Most of the large towns in 
Prussia avail themselves of this authority. The current year is 
marked by the passage of a law (May 19) extending this power to 
local authorities in the smaller towns and rural districts in the fol- 
lowing provinces: Brandenburg, Pomerania, Saxony, Schleswig-Hol- 
stein, Westphalia, the Rhine Province, and Hohenzollern. 
In accordance with this law— 
all boys under 18 in employment may be required to attend a continuation 
school during three consecutive winters; the time for the instruction and other 
details are to be settled by the local authority, but no classes are to be held, as a 
rule, on Sundays. 
During the current year, also, attendance upon industrial con- 
tinuation schools has been made compulsory in the free city of 
Hamburg. This law is the outcome of an agitation that has been 
prolonged for several years, the discussion turning chiefly upon the 
proposition in the Lower House to extend the compulsion to girls, 
and to youths entitled to serve only one year in the army, while the 
Senate wished to exclude both these classes. The law as passed 
represents conclusions reached as a result of the largest experience 
in the Empire; the text of the bill, which is given below, is, therefore, 
highly suggestive. 
(1) Attendance at a continuation school is compulsory upon all male persons 
under 18 years of age in the town of Hamburg and in Great and Little Bradenau who 
have left school and are in employment. The compulsion extends, as a rule, to 
times of temporary unemployment, and lasts for three years aiter leaving the elemen- 
tary school, but not beyond the end of the school year in which the age of 17 is 
reached. 
(2) The following are exempted from attendance: (a) Those who can give proof 
of having reached the standard aimed at in the continuation school; (b) those attend- 
ing some other continuation or trade school; (c) those who have passed the examina- 
tion exempting them from more than one year of military service. 
(3) A special committee for the management of trade and continuation schools is 
to be formed, consisting of representatives of the senate and of the house of bur- 
gesses, as well as representatives of the chambers of trade and commerce, and of the 
various educational authorities. 
(4) The instruction is to be arranged with a view to training the boys for a trade. 
The number of hours per week is to be eight for those trades requiring drawing, and 
six for other trades, and all classes are to be held on week days and before 8 p. m., 
at latest. Details as to times and subjects are to be settled after consultation with 
all the authorities concerned. 
(5) Employers of labor are required to notify to the continuation school authority 
the names of all their employees of compulsory school age six days after engaging 
them, at the latest, and to give information when they leave their employment. 
(6) Employers of labor, as well as parents and guardians, are under obligation to 
see that the young people attend school and that they do so regularly. 
(7) Employers of labor, parents and guardians, and also children of school age 
who do not comply with the provisions of the law, are liable to a fine of 60 marks, or 
in cases of inability to pay, 14 days’ imprisonment.

(8) A fee of 6 marks is to be paid for each scholar every half year, by the employer 
with whom the boy is working, on June 15 and December 15, respectively. If out of 
employment on these dates, the next employer is required to pay the fee, which 
may, in all cases, be recovered from the employee.' 
Statistics —At the close of 1911 Germany possessed about 3,300 
industrial continuation schools, of which nearly 3,000 were under 
obligatory ordinance. The number of pupils was approximately 
550,000. The commercial continuation schools not included in the 
foregoing totals numbered at the same time 700, of which only 
80 were not under obligatory regulations. .The number of pupils 
in the commercial schools was, in round numbers, 102,000; 90,000 
boys and 12,000 girls. 
Agricultural continuation schools are very numerous in Prussia, 
Bavaria, and Alsace-Lorraine. For all Germany the number was 
1,700 obligatory and 3,500 optional. They comprise altogether 
about 84,000 pupils. 
Tn addition to the continuation schools having a vocational purpose, 
there were in Germany at the close of 1911, 16,000 continuation 
schools for general instruction, attended by 350,000 boys and 
250,000 girls. 
The foregoing statistics do not include the continuation schools 
of an industrial character for young women; since, as a rule, these 
have not been brought under obligatory orders, it is difficult to secure 
exact statistics relating to them. The reports indicate, however, 
that great interest is taken in the domestic training of young women 
in the Grand Duchy of Baden and in Alsace-Lorraine. ? 
As a general rule, the continuation schools are supported by the 
communes, with the aid of chambers of commerce, commercial 
societies, trade unions, etc. The annual expenditure for the schools 
of this order is estimated at 22,000,000 marks ($5,236,000); of this 
total the communes supply 10,500,000 marks, the State 6,500,000, 
and employers and pupils in the way of fees 4,500,000. The balance 
is met by voluntary subscriptions. The communes also furnish 
housing, light, heat, etc., for the schools. 
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL INTERESTS. 
In his letter already referred to, Dr. McMurry sums up the current 
educational interests in Germany as follows: 
Nearly all the important problems that we are struggling with in American schools 
are under lively, and almost too lively, discussion in Germany, only from the stand- 
point peculiar to German conditions; for example, vocational training, education of 
women, coeducation, experimental psychology, the common school as a basis for all 
schools leading to higher instruction, such as colleges, universities, and technical 
schools, moral and religious education, place and function of the fine arts, and uni-

  versity education. I was atonished at the vigor and incisiveness of the discussion 
on all these points. I think it is also correct to say that in nearly all these respects 
they are tending very rapidly toward some of the results which we have already 
reached in America; for example, coeducation, the overthrow of the old classics 
monopoly in education, introduction of construction and manual training in the 
schools, etc. Religious education is also being very vigorously discussed. 
From the current literature of education one gets a very strong impression that 
German writers on the subject are nearly always men of large and rich experience in 
practical educational work, and that they possess a sort of philosophical balance 
which prevents them from extreme radicalness or onesidedness. 
RELIGIOUS AND MORAL INSTRUCTION. 
The following statement shows the present status of religious and 
moral instruction in the elementary schools of Germany, with special 
reference to the city of Coburg, which is regarded as typical: 
In every Protestant school religious and moral instruction is given, and the Bible 
stories used are so written that great opportunity is given the teacher to include 
both. In the schools in Coburg ! and throughout the entire Empire, a participation 
by the scholars in religious and moral instruction is compulsory. Children of Catholic 
or Jewish parentage are, however, excepted, but must receive special religious and 
moral instruction from a Catholic priest or a Jewish rabbi in lieu of that given in the 
schools. 
The real religious instruction begins with the third school year, there being three 
or four lessons of an hour in length each week. In the Coburg schools three lessons 
are given. Only fairy tales, ending with a moral, are told in the first two school years 
two hours each week. This, in America, I think would be called moral instruction. 
The following description of one of these lessons gives a fair idea of how the children 
are instructed: The teacher first relates a Bible story in divisions, each of which is 
repeated by the children. The whole story is then read and the contents are brought 
to the understanding of the children by means of questions and explanations. Bible 
sayings, religious songs, and pieces taken from the catechism finish the lesson if time 
allows. Usually in the first and second school years, and sometimes in the third year 
as well, no books are used. In the third to the fifth years a book containing Bible 
~ stories is used, while in the sixth to the eighth school years either the Bible or—as is 
the case in most States—a so-called Bible Reading Book is used, containing extracts 
provided especially for school purposes, in which the parts not understood by 
children are left out. The ‘“‘whole” Bible has not been in use in Coburg for over 
10 years. The New Testament is also used in religious instruction. For the schools 
in the city of Coburg there is another special Biblical reading book in use, edited by 
the Coburg director of schools already mentioned, called ‘‘Reading Book from the 
Old and New Testament” (Lesebuch aus dem Alten und Neuen Testament), which 
is better adapted to the needs of school children. It contains a selected text with 
Biblical sayings, songs taken from the hymnal, and repetition questions at intervals. 
Large Biblical pictures, which are hung on the walls of the schoolrooms, are in general 
use in Germany, and have already met with much favor and ready sale in all the 
civilized countries of Europe. Several hundred of these pictures have been sent to 
the United States, but have evidently not yet come into public notice, for the sales 
are still very small.”

of the Religious Instruction in the Public Schools”? (Vorfragon zur Reform des Religionsunterrichts in

820 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
CLASSIFICATION. 
The old gymnasium, with its traditions extending over centuries, 
was until a few decades ago the only preparatory school for the 
universities. It is characterized now, as then, by its extreme adher- 
ence to the study of the dead languages; and a large proportion of 
the full secondary schools, however termed, are still arranged accord- 
ing to the traditional plan. 
The progymnasia, often called Latin schools in South Germany, 
are schools without the three upper classes, and chiefly devoted to 
the study of Latin and Greek. 
The salient fact in German secondary education is the rise of the 
reform schools. To quote a recent authority:on this subject: 
Since German educational methods were last exhibited in America (St. Louis, 1904), 
reform schools have made great strides in Germany. In the United States this term 
conveys a totally different meaning. In Germany it represents schools of a classic, 
or a modern, tendency which first instruct all their pupils alike through several 
classes, and then on this common foundation continue the instruction either in the 
classical method of the gymnasium, or in giving greater attention to the modern 
languages, mathematics, and the natural sciences. 
Since Director Schlee, of Altona, created this common basis for the Realgymnasium 
(a high school ofnine classes, with Latin, French, and English, but no Greek) and the 
Realschule (a high school of six classes, without the three upper ones, and which 
cultivates modern languages only), a great deal has been written for and against 
this principle. Extended practical trials of it were not made until 1890; in 1898 
this reform plan was working at 30 German high schools, two systems being dis- 
tinguished—that of Altona and that of Frankfort. 
In both these systems the teaching of French began in Sexta (elementary class, 
pupils averaging 10 years old); but the first added English in the third and Latin in 
the fourth school year, while the Frankfort system, chiefly advocated by Privy 
Councillor Reinhardt, director of the Goethe Gymnasium at Frankfort on the Main, 
allows of only one foreign language (French) in the three years’ course of common 
instruction, followed in the fourth year by thorough instruction in Latin; and not 
until the sixth school year (when the pupils are about 15 or 16) is English added on 
the modern side (Reform-Realgymnasium) and Greek on the classical side (Reform- 
Gymnasium). 
After six years’ attendance at one of the realschulen with satisfactory results, the 
pupil receives a certificate entitling him to serve for one year in the army, instead 
of two. The realschule with six classes, which teaches French and English, but no 
dead languages, dismisses its pupils with this certificate. 
As the founder of the Berlin realschulen (modern schools) desired to give an oppor- 
tunity to clever boys leaving the upper classes of the elementary schools (mostly at 
12 years of age) to enter a high school without difficulty and take advantage of its 
educational privileges, the authorities have created a number of realschulen (now 
13) in the curriculum of which no foreign langugage is taught in the first two classes. 
This is contrary to the general Government plan for all realschulen outside Berlin, 
and is meant to facilitate the transfer of pupils from the elementary into the higher 
schools. In the four upper classes French is taught very thoroughly, while English 
has on the whole not sufficient time devoted to it. There is no opportunity for the 
mixed education of boys and girls in schools of this type.
-P-A-G-E-875
  
GERMANY. 821 
EINHEITSCHULE. 
Reference may here be made to the system of the ‘‘Hinheitschule,” 
which involves both elementary and secondary -education. This 
system provides for a single school common to all the children of the 
locality, to take the place of the several kinds of elementary schools 
during the first six years of instruction, i. e., ages 6 to 12. The sepa- 
ration of pupils according to the different schools in which they will 
continue their education takes place at 12 years of age, some passing 
over into the gymnasia, others into the realgymnasia, realschulen, 
or the higher city schools. The einheitschule has been tried in Ham- 
burg and some other cities, and is vigorously advocated by many 
authorities, among them Prof. Rein, of Jena, as a means of lessening 
overpressure on the pupils, of promoting sounder principles of teach- 
ing, and of correcting the evils of extreme social distinctions. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. 
In Baden girls are admitted to the gymnasia, but in the other 
German States they receive secondary education in the intermediate 
schools or in the higher schools for girls, which are either private or 
municipalinstitutions. In thesecondary course for girls prominence 
is given to modern languages, and the instruction is carried to a point 
which enables pupils to enter the teachers’ seminaries that are often 
connected with these establishments. In these the students acquire 
both the theory and art of teaching, the latter by means of the ‘‘prac- 
tice schools” (Ubungsschulen) connected with the seminaries. A 
typical example of this class of schools is found in the Royal Augusta- 
schule at Berlin. The seminary of this school grants a certificate 
qualifying for the post of teacher at the higher and intermediate grade 
girls’ schools, and offers the pupils the chance of taking courses in the 
classical languages required for entrance to the universities. The 
first gymnasium for girls giving a certificate qualifying for the uni- 
versity was founded in Carlsruhe in 1893; almost at the same time 
Helene Lange opened a gymnasium course for girls in Berlin, and this 
was followed by a gymnasium course established in Leipzig by Frau- 
lein Dr. Windscheid. 
OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF WOMEN STUDENTS. 
It is worthy of note that young men intending to qualify for 
professorships in secondary schools receive their preparation at the 
universities. In connection also with the secondary schools them- 
selves seminary courses have been introduced which are intended to 
give the younger teachers, who are just beginning their professional 
careers, the opportunity of obtaining special pedagogic training. 
This is afforded by means of conferences held under the presidency of
-P-A-G-E-876
  
822 EDUCATION REPORT, 1918, 
the director and by lectures given by capable higher-grade teachers. 
The student teacher also prepares essays upon questions of education 
and methods. 
The exclusion of.girls from the Gymnasia, and the consequent 
obstacles in the way of their preparation for the universities where 
these are open to women, and the distinction between the training 
of young men and young women aspiring alike to be teachers of sec- 
ondary schools, are fruitful causes of discontent on the part of women 
teachers and the subject of constant discussion in the associations of 
women.

THE UNIVERSITIES, 
STATISTICS. 
The 21 universities of the German Empire had a total attendance 
of 60,346 students in the summer semester of 1913. This total 
includes 4,841 foreign students, of whom 4,310 came from other 
European countries, 287 from America, 196 from Asia, 45 from 
Africa, and 3 from Australia. The University of Berlin led, with 8,383 
students. Munich followed, with 6,655; Leipzig had 5,171; Bonn, 
4,460; Freiburg, 3,163. The number of students at the remaining 
universities range from 1,005 at Rostock to 2,790 at Breslau. Berlin 
naturally attracted the greatest number of foreigners, viz, 1,393— 
nearly one-third of the total number. 
One of the most noteworthy events in the development of univer- 
sity life in Germany relates to the admission of women students, 
and the increasing numbers of women availing themselves of this
-P-A-G-E-877
  
GERMANY. 823 
privilege is attracting great attention and has given the text for 
current discussions of social and economic problems. The total 
number of women students reported in the summer semester of 1913 
was 3,400, which, it will be seen, is a little more than 5 per cent of 
the total student body. In 1908 only 320 women students were 
registered, hence the number has increased tenfold. The faculty of 
philosophy attracted 2,502 women, and medicine followed with 804. 
The faculty of law reported only 82, and the faculty of theology 12. 
It is of further interest to note that the University of Berlin regis- 
tered 770 women, or nearly one-fourth of the total. 
The annual expenditure for the universities amounts in round 
numbers to about 37,000,000 marks, equivalent to $8,806,000. In 
1912 the expenditure for the University of Berlin was 4,738,061 
marks ($1,127,659). Of this amount, 3,931,169 marks, about 83 per 
cent, was derived from State funds. In general, State subsidies pro- 
vide the larger proportion of the incomes of the several universities. 
EXPANSION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL FACULTY. 
The development of science teaching in the German universities 
during the last two decades and its effects upon the industrial 
development of the Empire have attracted so much attention that 
movements in other faculties have been somewhat obscured. Special 
interest, however, attaches to the expansion of the philosophical 
faculty, which is not only a matter of importance in itself, but which 
has stimulated in great measure the scientific expansion. 
In its original form the philosophical faculty was intended to 
prepare students for entrance to the professional faculties, but at 
present its courses of instruction comprise the entire field of science, 
extending far beyond the range of a specialized profession. The 
faculty now affords professional training for the teachers of secondary 
schools and the scientific instruction which is essential to the newer 
technical professions, such as chemistry, agriculture, forestry, and 
more recently political. economy and science. In this faculty, also, 
medical students receive their training in natural science. On 
account of this extension, the philosophical faculty often requires 
the service of more professors than all the other faculties together. 
At some universities the faculty has been divided into two branches, 
the historical-philosophical and the mathematical-natural science. 
At other universities two sections have been formed having certain 
points in common. At Tubingen a special political science faculty 
has developed, and a similar faculty at Munich. 
This expansion of the philosophical faculty has important bearings 
upon education, considered both as a science and as an art. Several 
of the universities have one or more professors of pedagogics in the 
philosophical faculty, but according to Dr. Wilhelm Minch the sub-
-P-A-G-E-878
    
824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
ject has been usually regarded ‘‘only as a sort of minor division in 
the department of psychology, although several other sciences, like 
ethics, political science, and the history of civilization, trench on that 
subject just as much.” The statement quoted was made in 1911, 
at which time Dr. Minch was holding the chair of pedagogy in the 
University of Berlin. The fame of his teaching attracted many 
students, and gave an impulse to the subject in that university 
which led to pians for organizing a special seminary in its interest, 
Although Prof. Minch has since died, these plans have not been 
abandoned. At the same time a pedagogical seminary on a large 
scale was projected for Halle University, and thus these two univer- 
sities, it was expected, would be placed upon the same plane as Jena 
and Leipzig, long celebrated for their pedagogical seminaries. 
At Jena education is treated in a very comprehensive manner, 
including pedagogical principles and methods, and their relations to 
philosophy and ethics, but with strong emphasis on the Herbartian 
theory. The prospectus of the University of Berlin announced for 
the summer of 1912 a course in the history of pedagogics by Dr. 
Benno Erdmann, who is well known for his exposition of philosophy 
and experimental psychology. The University of Halle in its 
announcement for the winter session ending March 15, 1913, com- 
prises a pedagogical seminar including one course of lectures on the 
history of pedagogies by Prof. Dr. Fries, who is well known also for 
his critical exposition of philosophical systems. 
The intimate union of philosophy and pedagogics in university 
instruction accords with their fundamental relations; from age to age 
philosophy has determined the prevailing doctrines and processes of 
education. The latest successor of Kant in the University of Konigs- 
berg, Narciss Ach, in his “Seminar of Pedagogy,” expounds the 
modern philosophies, including Kant, whose ‘Critique of Pure Rea- 
son’ and “Categorical Imperative” changed for a generation the 
treatment of logic and ethics in the higher schools. 
The special seminars of pedagogics, which are among the latest 
adjuncts of the German universities, afford the opportunity for 
emphasizing the relations of philosophy and psychology to the science 
and art of education and illustrate also the increasing recognition of 
teaching as a liberal profession. 
THE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The scientific expansion of the universities, to which reference has 
already been made, is reflected in the increasing activity of the scien- 
tific academies which maintain close relations with the universities. 
The academies themselves preceded the great university movement, 
the Royal Academy of Science in Berlin, dating from 1700, the very 
dawn of the eighteenth century, which was distinguished by this form
-P-A-G-E-879
GERMANY, 825 
of organization in the chief nations. The scientific museums are a 
direct outcome of the development of scientific teaching, and. this 
entire movement reaches its climax in the organization of technical 
high schools, which have the prestige of universities. 
The following table shows the attendance and the expenditure (in 
round numbers) of the 11 schools of this type in 1912-13:

  TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS.! 
Teaching is a profession in Germany in a sense in which it is not 
in the United States, and the activities of German teachers’ organiza- 
tions are of definitely professional character. In the main these 
activities center about two aims: Betterment of professional status 
on the one hand, as represented in higher salaries, improved working 
conditions, and more liberal pension provisions; and educational 
advancement on the other. In respect to the first of these two aims, 
the German teachers’ associations partake of the function of guilds 
or labor unions—they represent the organized effort of the teachers 
as a class to better their position. In their educational aims the 
German associations are more comparable to the organizations of 
teachers in the United States. In both lines of activity the German 
teachers’ societies demonstrate the effectiveness of group association 
for a common definite end; the least that can be said of them, from 
the general association itself down to the innumerable local and 
special branches, is that they are highly efficient for the purposes for 
which they exist. 
The economic program is none the less effective because frankly 
avowed. Occasionally it appears to be the dominant interest. Thus 
the secretary of the general association of women teachers (Allge- 
meiner Deutscher Lehrerinnenverein), in a report covering the work 
of the association for the two-year period 1911-1913, lays special   
1 Statement furnished by W. Carson Ryan, jr.

  826 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
stress on the work of the organization for salary increases, No less 
than 46 main branches of this association have been waging an active 
campaign for better salaries during the past two years. Most of 
them, in view of the rapidly rising rents in German cities, have been 
agitating for an increase in the ‘‘house money” which the German 
city teacher regularly receives in lieu of residence. Although in Ber- 
lin, Brandenburg, Dusseldorf, Elbing, Magdeburg, and Naumburg the 
agitation was without results, varying success in receiving additional 
house money is reported from Elberfeld (40 per cent increase); Har- 
burg (an increase from 140 marks to 200 marks for one group of 
teachers and a concession of 70 marks annually to another group); 
Osnabruck, Neukoln, and in Silesia and Posen. In Saxony and 
Lubeck the special teachers obtained official recognition of certain 
of their demands for tenure of office and salary increase; in Mecklen- 
burg higher pay was secured in the larger cities; Hamburg raised 
the entrance salary of teachers 150 marks and increased the maxi- 
mum by 500 marks. 
It is not to be understood, however, that the educational aim is 
allowed to be subordinated to the more tangible work of salary agita- 
tion. All the teachers’ associations, general, State, provincial, or local, 
have vigorous educational programs. The Deutscher Lehrerverein, 
which is the central organization of teachers, corresponding roughly 
to the National Education Association in the United States, has a 
Pidagogische Zentrale, which acts as a sort of special executive 
council on the science of education, publishes a valuable yearbook, 
and in a variety of ways influences and directs current educational 
thought in Germany. The 1912 yearbook of the Pidagogische 
Zentrale discussed the principle of the Arbeitsschule as applied to 
science instruction. The 1913 volume carried on the same topic 
under the title ‘‘Reform efforts in geography and history teaching,” 
and also discussed to some extent the development of pedagogy as a 
science. A summary of the papers in this yearbook will give some 
idea of what German teachers are currently thinking about: 
In I, Richard Seyfert discusses the teaching of the home locality as exemplifying 
directness in instruction; Albert Miller sums up the current efforts at reform in geog- 
raphy teaching; G. Kalb tells how knowledge of local geography may be acquired 
by school walking trips; Richard Reisig shows the possibilities in linking up geogra- 
phy with drawing; M. Greubel argues for adequate modeling as a supplement to draw- 
ing in illustrating geography; Alfred Frenzel goes into details of instruction, using 
the River Elbe as a topic; Hans Stiibler discusses geography instruction as a part of 
the industrial work; R. Kabisch takes up the reform movement in history; A. C. 
Scheiblhuber reviews the relation of imaginative writing to the acquirement of his- 
tory; A. Tecklenburg relates history to the conditions of the home locality; G. Klemm 
considers history teaching of the work school type as a means of developing the con- 
cept of civilization and community life; Wilhelm Schremmer discusses the use of 
sources.
-P-A-G-E-881
GERMANY. 827 
In II, Aloys Fischer takes up the significance of the experiment in pedagogical 
research and the idea of an exact pedagogy; G. Deuchler considers the needs of scien- 
tific pedagogy in the universities; and R. Seyfert writes of psychology and pedagogy 
in the seminar. Short descriptions are also given of the Leipzig Institute for Experi- 
mental Pedagogy and Psychology; the Munich Pedagogical-Psychological Institutes 
and the scientific lectures of the Berlin Teachers’ Association. 
At the general meeting of the German Teachers’ Association, which 
will take place June 1-4, 1914, at Kiel, the topics to be discussed are: 
The question of the uniform public school (Die Nationale Einheits- 
schule); the attitude of the German Teachers’ Association toward 
pedagogy as a science; and the fundamental question, Is the school 
in danger of departing from its real function? The latter question, 
judging from a preliminary discussion of the points at issue by C. L. A. 
Pretzel, president of the association, will bring out the opinions of 
teachers on a problem that affects education everywhere—just where 
the line ought to be drawn between what the schools should do and 
should not do. That German teachers and their leaders realize the 
attractiveness of a combined study and pleasure trip may be seen 
from the fact that the June meeting will take place while the Ger- 
man Navy is going through its spring maneuvers, and as a special 
inducement the teachers are invited to visit, ‘‘in the company of 
expert guides,’ every vessel of the fleet, including the imperial yacht. 
Professional education is made as much of in the local groups as 
in the central organizations. The Berlin teachers’ association 
planned and carried out a vacation course of lectures at the University 
of Berlin, inviting teachers from all over Germany to participate. 
Courses were given in the following subjects: Philosophy, psychology, 
theology, history, astronomy, zoology, music, and laboratory work 
in psychology and pedagogy, and microscopy of plants and animals. 
The significant point in this is not that the courses were given, but 
that the teachers’ association directed the enterprise. 
In their educational meetings the German associations regularly 
follow the plan of setting aside one or two topics for discussion, 
assigning one speaker to lead off with an outline of the problem and 
a statement of his interpretation of it, and then opening the meeting 
to representatives of different opinions and different localities. In 
this way attention is concentrated on one or two topics; and the 
fact that the listeners are to render a definite decision at the close of 
the meeting in the form of adopting or rejecting proposals adds decided 
zest to the arguments. As an instance, at the Prussian ‘‘Lehrertag,”’ 
December 29, 1913, one of the really burning educational questions 
in Germany—that of university training for public-school teachers— 
was argued pro and con. After much discussion, some of which was  
-P-A-G-E-882
  828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
decidedly sharp, the following resolutions were adopted as the sense 
of the meeting: 
I. The Seventh Conference of Prussian Teachers declares its adherence to the reso- 
lutions adopted by the meeting of German teachers at Konigsberg in 1904, in which 
the demand is expressed that in the future all teachers shall receive their preliminary 
raining in the university; that for the present the elementary teachers’ certificate 
shall be sufficient warrant for admission to university study. 
Il. The teachers’ seminar is to be developed into an institution based upon the 
elementary school and equivalent to the three types of scondary schools for boys. 
III. In the transition period the seminar is to be arranged as follows: [Details 
omitted.] 
IV. All supervisory and administrative positions are to be held open to any teacher 
now in office without discrimination. 
To the two lines of association activity, economic and educational, 
a third has recently been added—that of social welfare. Social 
welfare work on the part of teachers’ associations (particularly 
societies of women teachers) includes: Establishing kindergartens and 
day nurseries; maintaining school lunches; doing vacation work of 
all kinds—swimming lessons, walking trips, etc.; play supervising, 
story-telling hours, and dramatics; aiding in the movement to 
‘improve motion pictures for school children; organizing young peo- 
ples’ societies; agitating against obscenity in all forms; publishing 
free lists of books and purchasing books; establishing and supporting 
free reading rooms; giving Christmas festivals for poor school 
children, etc. A number of the branches of the women teachers’ 
association are paying special attention to the problem of the girl 
just leaving school to go to work. This activity takes the form some- 
times of personal guidance in the selection of a vocation, of evening 
lectures on alcohol, morals, and sex enlightenment, of parents’ 
evenings, mothers’ meetings, etc. In some cases, where the com- 
munity did not furnish vocational opportunities for girls, the teachers’ 
associations have started vocational schools for girls and supported 
them with private funds. 
The vigorous professional spirit that gives the German teachers’ 
organizations much of their strength also serves as a limitation to 
.the extent of their influence. Most of the German associations of 
teachers are essentially of the group type. They are organizations 
of elementary teachers or secondary teachers or technical school 
professors, each with its special group activity, rather than educa- 
tional associations in the larger sense. Such organizations naturally 
make no appeal to others than teachers who might be profoundly 
interested in education. One of the new developments of the last 
few years is the formation of societies having a more general educa- 
tional purpose. Thus, the League for School Reform (Bund fiir 
Schulreform), though made up of educators, is not confined to any 
one group and hopes eventually to attract “laymen” to member-
-P-A-G-E-883

ship. In its meetings teachers from elementary schools, secondary 
schools, seminars, ete., docents from the universities, administrative 
officers, and others in any way interested in education come together 
and begin to realize that “all educators have common problems to 
solve and that their common efforts may have common aims and 
purposes.” This organization considers as its problems: The whole 
question of the ‘Arbeitsschule”; mental development and the 
school; types of schools; education for teachers; sex difference 
and its significance for education; relation of home and school. 
The league has held three congresses: Dresden, 1911; Munich, 
1912; and Breslau, 1913. The 1913 meeting was devoted to a 
thorough and illuminating discussion of the problem of coeduca- 
tion and coinstruction. 
The effort of schoolmen to get together in educational problems 
with those outside of school work is noticeable in another recent 
conference of considerable importance. On February 8, 1913, a 
conference on vocational guidance was held at Charlottenburg, par- 
ticipated in by Government authorities, representatives of trade and 
industry, of labor, and of the schools. Two speakers supplied by the 
“Qentral Bureau of Public Welfare” (Zentralstelle fiir Volkswohl- 
fahrt) outlined respectively the need of vocational guidance and the 
way in which the work should be organized. The following is a 
summary of the resolutions adopted at the close of the conference: 
1. Vocational counseling and placement are urgently. recommended for public- 
school pupils in the interest of the pupils themselves, as well as for economic reasons. 
The object of vocational guidance is the direction of young people into vocations in 
accordance with individual preference and ability considered in their relation to the 
service of the common welfare. The establishment of vocation bureaus is considered 
necessary also for higher positions and for feminine occupations. 
2. Of special importance for the vocational guidance and placement of public- 
school children is the cooperation of (a) the school, (6) the school physician, (c) labor 
exchanges, (d) boards of trade, and (e) child-welfare organizations. To facilitate the 
common purpose, committees should be formed and should be aided by expert and 
trained counselors. The trade associations and women’s organizations are particularly 
adapted for maintaining vocation bureaus. 
3. This conference requests all participating bureaus to take up vigorously the 
task of furthering vocational guidance and placement. This conference will select a 
committee which shall be authorized to advance the movement in every possible 
way, to forma center for uniting all efforts in this direction, and to make possible an 
interchange of experiences. This committee shall be composed of representatives 
of the central teachers’ association, the continuation school societies, the associations 
of school physicians, the labor association, the trade chambers, industrial societies, 
chambers of commerce, employers’ organizations, together with individual vocational 
counselors, representatives of vocation bureaus, and other individuals whose coopera- 
ticn may seem advisable upon further consideration. 
An idea of the multiplicity of teachers’ associations in Germany 
may be obtained from a glance at the following partial list of such 
associations for the city of Berlin alone: The Berlin teachers’ society,
-P-A-G-E-884
830 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Society for the study of local geography, Teachers’ science society, 
Society for school hygiene, Drawing society, Manual training asso- 
ciation, Foreign language society, League of auxiliary schools, the 
Diesterweg foundation, Teachers of the deaf, Society for the improve- 
ment of language, Committee of censorship for children’s books, 
Association of Catholic teachers of Berlin, Motion-picture committee 
for Berlin schools, Berlin association for vacation colonies, Central 
association for student walking trips, Berlin teachers’ singing society, 
Association for the education and care of backward children. The 
tendency to organize societies and hold meetings is evidenced by 
the following conferences, conventions, and congresses held recently: 
Education for temperance, auxiliary schools, juvenile literature, 
motion pictures in education (the so-called “ Kinokongress’’), Protes- 
tant schools, school hygiene, tuberculosis among school children, 
scientific pedagogy, and education for citizenship.

AUSTRIA. 
THE SYSTEM OF GENERAL EDUCATION. 
The organization of schools in Austria is similar to that of Ger- 
many. Elementary education is given in Volksschulen and higher 
elementary or Birgerschulen. Many of the former are ungraded, 
especially in the country, while those in the towns or cities have 
from two to eight classes. School attendance is compulsory for all 
children, the limits of compulsion in the majority of the Provinces 
being from 6 to 14 years of age. In Istria, Galicia, and Dalmatia, 
the limits are 6 to 12. Children may obtain a certificate when they 
have satisfactorily completed the required course of elementary 
studies, but children employed in large factories must continue their 
education at special schools, with the aid of their employers. 
The expenditures for elementary education fall chiefly upon the 
communes. The teachers are, as a rule, fully prepared for their 
calling, and the schools are well supplied with material aids to in- 
struction. On account of the different races comprised in the Em- 
pire, the language of instruction is a subject of much discussion, and 
at times decided efforts have been made to force the use of the Ger- 
man language upon all schools. These efforts have, however, failed, 
and the language varies in schools, that being generally employed 
which is the language of the majority of the pupils in the respective 
school. In many schools more than one language is used by the 
teacher. 
The secondary schools comprise three classes: Gymnasia or classi- 
cal schools, having an eight years’ course; Realschulen, having a 
course of seven years, modern languages replacing Latin and Greek; 
and Realgymnasia. The last have a four years’ course, which may 
include Latin and Greek. 
The secondary schools are either public (established by State or 
Province) or private, but all are subject to Government supervision, 
831
-P-A-G-E-886

follow the same programs, and prepare for the same examinations. 
Separate secondary schools are maintained for girls. State schools 
and those provided by the cities are noted for their fine buildings 
and liberal equipments. The following tables summarize the latest 
official statistics pertaining to the different classes of schools and 
higher institutions.

AUSTRIA, : 833 
INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Austria is distinguished by its elaborate provision for industrial 
and technical education. This work is managed independently of 
the system of general education, and the control of the various 
orders of training is centralized in different ministries. 
Industrial schools are under the ministry of public works, which 
acts in counsel with the departments of education and com- 
merce. At the head of this system are nine central institutions, all 
but one situated at Vienna; the exception is the art-trade school at 
Prague. Every trade and mechanical occupation is represented in 
the remaining schools, which include polytechnic or group schools, 
schools for single trades, for single branches of industry, industrial 
continuation schools, and schools for the industrial callings open to 
women. 
The polytechnic, trade, and industrial art. schools of Austria are 
regarded as models for other countries. The industrial continuation 
schools, on the contrary, are less satisfactory. Their defects are 
attributed mainly to the employment, of the ordinary elementary 
teachers, who naturally do not understand the aims and needs of 
schools of this order, and to the difficulty of arranging for day attend- 
ance. The ministry of public works has already taken measures to 
effect, a change in these two conditions; hence it may be said that 
the industrial continuation schools are at a transition stage. 
The agricultural technical schools are under the ministry of agricul- 
ture. They are all subject to State supervision and are maintained 
by State funds. : 
According to official statistics for 1909-10, there were altogether 
5,721 technical and industrial schools below the grade of the technical 
high schools, with 381,702 students. 
The close relation between trade schools and local industries in 
Austria may be illustrated by the schools for the gold and silver 
smiths trade, which are maintained in Vienna, which is famous for its 
trade in ornaments of precious metals and stones. In this city there 
are four schools for the gold and silver smiths trade—three municipal 
and the fourth maintained by the jewelers’ guild. The branches of 
study include trade, commercial matters, and work in silver and gold; 
in the guild school is added the study of gems, etching, and engray- 
ing. The school year lasts nine months, and attendance is obligatory 
for all who anticipate entering into this trade. The art of making 
ornaments of precious metals and stones is not taught in the schools, 
but must be learned during an apprenticeship which lasts from three 
to four years; but attendance upon one of the schools mentioned 
above is obligatory during the apprenticeship period.

  HUNGARY. 
The system of public education in Hungary is organized on, lines 
similar to those of Austria. Both derived their original impulse from 
the “ Ratio educationis” issued by the Empress Maria Theresa, but in 
Hungary a new direction, modern and national, was given to the 
system by the efforts of Baron Joseph Eétvés, the first Hungarian 
minister of instruction, who was brought into prominence by the 
revolutionary events of 1848. In his second term as minister, 
1867-1870, Baron Eétvés succeeded in carrying the elementary 
education act of 1868, which, with subsequent amending acts, con- 
stitutes the organic law of elementary education in force at the 
present time. The original law (1868) made school attendance oblig- 
atory for children from 6 to 12 years of age, and attendance at con- 
tinuation schools compulsory for the ages 12 to 15. Interest in 
industrial pursuits was promoted by -the practical subjects which 
were included in the original programs for elementary schools. Chief 
among these are the elements of natural science, with special regard 
to the occupations of the majority of the parents in the respective 
districts, practical gardening, drawing, and needlework. The ten- 
dencies cultivated in the elementary day schools are developed in the 
continuation schools, which at first simply continued or reviewed the 
subjects of the elementary schools. Since 1902 provision has been 
made for continuation schools having a technical character. 
As regards popular education, therefore, Hungary anticipated the 
most important recent movements. 
The secondary schools of Hungary are classified like those of 
Austria, as Gymnasia and Realgymnasia. Separate schools and a 
distinctive type of education for girls mark the system; but in 1895, 
by the authorization of Minister Wlasseis, young women were admitted 
to the university, and opportunities for preparation were afforded 
them by the establishment of a special classical course in the Budapest 
high school for girls. This school has since been transformed into a 
girls’ classical school, and other similar schools have been established; 
hence the education of girls now proceeds along two lines—one marked
-P-A-G-E-889

by modern languages and domestic science; the other assimilated to 
the classical schools for boys.

INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION, 
Hungary is abundantly supplied with industrial, technical, and 
commercial schools and institutions for agriculture. The total num- 
ber of pupils under instruction in these various classes of institutions 
in 1911 was 102,000. The law requires the establishment of appren- 
tice schools in all communities in which there are 50 apprentices work- 
ing in shops or factories; the masters of trade are obliged to provide 
for the attendance of their apprentices at these schools. 
The technical high school at Budapest, which is on the university 
plane, had 160 professors and 1,676 students in 1911-12. 
PROTECTION OF “ABANDONED CHILDREN.” 
Hungary is particularly noted for its system of infant protection, 
which dates from the efforts of the Countess Teresa Brunswick, who 
established the first infant home at Buda in 1829. She was supported 
in this effort by Count Szechenyi, the leader of the reform movement 
which spread over Hungary in the early years of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, and among its agencies developed an association for promoting 
the well being of children, which included among its members Louis 
Kossuth and many of his associates. Through the efforts of this asso- 
ciation a training college was established to prepare directresses of 
infant homes; and in 1848, when the war of independence broke out, 
89 homes were in operation. The work was crippled and the move- 
ment checked by the war, and little more was attempted in the same 
direction until the founding of a Froebelian association in 1869. This 
association and the Hungarian infant protective association have 
 
-P-A-G-E-890
836 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
ever since been centers of effort in behalf of young children. The State 
intervened actively in this work as early as 1891, at which time a law 
regulating this service was adopted. But it was not until 1901 that 
complete organization was given to the State system of infant pro- 
tection. The special features of this system are as follows: Provision 
for the establishment of infant homes by the State and by local au- 
thorities; the requirement of special training for the teachers and for 
other persons on the staff of the homes; the obligation placed upon 
parents to send their children between the ages of 3 and 6 who can 
not be properly cared for at home to the infant homes. For neglect of 
this duty the penalty of a fine ranging from 20 filler to 1 crown (5 to 
20 cents) is imposed. 
Provision for the care of abandoned children is made under some 
circumstances in public homes provided by the State; under other 
conditions the children are placed in families carefully selected with 
regard to their mode of living and the communities in which they live. 
The State maintains constant and careful supervision over all such 
children by means of a corps of specially trained inspectors. At the 
present time it is estimated that 55,000 children in different families, 
selected in 350 communes, are under the surveillance of the State. 
These children are furnished with clothing at public expense, no dis- 
tinction being made in this respect between them and other children 
in the same circle of life. About 85 per cent of all the wards of the 
State are committed to private families; the remainder are placed in 
the public homes. The latter are distinguished for their fine build- 
ings, admirably planned and thoroughly equipped for the instruction 
and entertainment of children. The training is marked by sympa- 
thetic adaptation to childhood and by the use of songs, stories, and 
pictures of national life which inspire love of Hungary. 
Ample provision is also made for the care and training of the blind, 
the deaf, and the dumb, and for children who are mentally defective. 
The education of these unfortunates ‘is under the supervision of the 
State in the same manner as that of normal children in the public 
schools. 
The demand for State control of the service arose from the inade- 
quacy of private and communal action and was based upon the prin- 
ciples advocated by Herbert Spencer, namely, that every neglected 
child has a right to the protection of the State, and that the welfare 
of the State demands such action. Wide scope was given to the ex- 
pression “abandoned child.” It was declared that every child 
deprived of sufficient food and of education, either because of poverty 
or environment or other chuses, is practically abandoned. Under 
this conception the protection of the State was to be extended to 
infants, to children of school age, and to adolescent youths between the 
ages of 14 and 16.

CHAPTER XXXVIII. 
EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE. 
ConTENTS.—Introduction—Recent events in Spain: Public-school education in Madrid; university move- 
ments—Portugal—Italy: Movements pertaining to elementary education; illiteracy; education of 
emigrants; welfare activities; promotion of agriculture; secondary and higher education—The Kingdoms 
of southeastern Europe: Disastrous effects of the B Ikan war; modern schools in the Turkish Empire. 
The States of southern Europe bordering on the Mediterranean are 
all marked by a high degree of illiteracy among the common people, 
and all have been recently the scene of conflicts, political or military, 
that have prevented the progress of education. During the present 
year, however, two of these States, Spain and Italy, have been free 
from disturbance and able to concentrate their energies upon matters 
of internal development, with the result that popular education has 
received new impulse, while the higher institutions have increased 
their resources and their activities. 
RECENT EVENTS IN SPAIN. 
The present year has given proof that the movement for the reform 
of primary education in Spain is firmly established in the Government 
policy. The movement began in 1900 by the creation of a ministry of 
education, which up to that time had been included within the minis- 
try of fomento (agriculture, public works, etc.). In 1902 the State 
assumed the payment of teachers’ salaries and the provision of school 
buildings in municipalities neglecting this duty. As a result of the 
events of 1909, which brought to a crisis the struggle between the 
elericals and the advocates of educational reform, the law of June 23, 
1909, was passed, extending the authority of the State in regard to 
the appointment of teachers, the conduct of schools, ete. The most 
important measure in the interests of primary education was the royal 
decree of January 1, 1911, creating the office of “general direction” 
of primary education in the ministry. The same year the budget for 
public instruction was increased by 6,000,000 pesetas ($1,158,000). 
Of this increase a large proportion was assigned for primary educa- 
tion, and for the employment of additional inspectors, increasing 
teachers’ salaries, and improving school buildings. The royal decree 
sanctioning the budget for 1911 provided that the lowest salaries 
837  
-P-A-G-E-892
  
838 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
for teachers, namely, 500 or 625 pesetas, should be raised to 1,000 
pesetas as far as possible. 
For the improvement of teachers already in the service, short 
courses of training have been instituted; and the teachers’ certificate, 
hitherto conferred by the Government upon candidates who had 
never attended a normal school, but who passed a very simple exami- 
nation, has been suppressed. 
The budget estimates for 1914 submitted by the Director General 
show the intention of continuing the efforts at reform in accordance 
with a general plan which includes increase of the administrative 
force; provision for sending students of the normal schools upon tours 
of observation for the improvement of their pedagogic, scientific, and 
artistic knowledge; the increase of salaries; and Government aid for 
the construction of school buildings.* 
Controversy has long prevailed over the matter of obligatory teach- 
ing of the catechism in the schools, and it was announced during the 
year that a royal decree had been drawn up making this study optional. 
Eventually, however, the decree was withdrawn, and the subject is 
still compulsory. 
The appointment of Dr. Altamira, the eminent savant, to the posi- 
tion of Director General of Primary Education has excited general 
confidence in the reform measures on account of the high esteem in 
which he is held by all parties. The disposition of the Government 
to avoid contest with the ecclesiastical authorities in regard to educa- 
tion is indicated by the decree respecting religious instruction in the 
schools. This decree provides that the catechism and sacred history 
shall be continued as obligatory subjects in the program of the public 
schools. But children of non-Catholic parents are exempt from 
attendance upon this instruction, at the written request of their 
parents. 
In a recent address Dr. Altamira sums up the situation with regard 
to primary education as follows: 
The development of primary education depends upon three principal factors: First, 
financial resources; second, an efficient teaching corps; third, the absolute separation 
of this work from all political influence. 
The appropriation for primary education in the budget for 1911 amounted to 
32,042,596 pesetas ($6,184,221.028). This sum was 6,000,000 pesetas in excess of the 
appropriation for the preceding year, but the budget for 1913 has carried a further 
increase of 6,000,000 pesetas, which amounts to an advance of 42,000,000 pesetas in 
three years. 
The general direction of primary education, which was established in January, 1911, 
has achieved a complete separation of the administration of primary schools from 
political influences. This central direction has organized courses for the preparation 
and improvement of teachers, and has succeeded in securing for them an increase of 
their salaries and a uniform classification. It has brought about the grading of a great

number of schools; established mutual aid societies among the pupils; introduced 
medical inspection of schools; increased the number of primary inspectors; and admit- 
ted women to this service. The establishment of circulating libraries and of courses 
of instruction for adults are among the latest evidences of progress. 
These results, in the opinion of Dr. Altamira, justify the belief that 
the progress of public instruction in Spain rests upon a permanent 
basis and inspires hope for the future. This confidence is strength- 
ened by the prosperity enjoyed by the country in 1912, which is 
evidenced by the reports of commercial, industrial, and agricultural 
activities. Great progress is reported in the planning and construc- 
tion of important public works, such as railroads, highways, harbor 
improvements, etc., and in measures for improving agriculture, which 
is the chief source of wealth. Unusual success attended the exhibi- 
tion of agricultural machinery held in Madrid in February of the 
present year. Farmers and landowners from the entire country 
were in attendance, and the interest manifested in the matters of 
machinery, dairying, etc., was so great that the exposition was pro- 
longed through a second week. 
PUBLIC-SCHOOL EDUCATION IN MADRID. 
The following detailed account of public-school education in Madrid 
indicates the manner in which the reform measures already considered 
are being carried out in the chief cities: 
According to the law of September 9, 1857, towns of 4,000 inhabitants should have 
three schools for boys and three for girls, the number of schools being increased by 
one for each sex for every 2,000 inhabitants over the above-mentioned number, and 
one-third of the total number of schools must be public. Taking the population of 
Madrid as 549,363 inhabitants, Madrid should have 551 schools, 184 of which should 
be public. Although there are more schools in Madrid than are required by law, 
they are far inferior to the present needs. The schools are about the same in number 
now as they were at the time the State took charge in 1902, but the cost to the cityis 
greater now than it was formerly, and if the royal decree of February 25, 1911, had 
been enforced the expenses for running the schools would have been raised to 500,000 
pesetas ($90,000) at least, without increasing the present number of teachers or gaining 
much in the way of hygiene and instruetion, and the cause of education in Madrid 
might have been compromised by the pretense of increasing the number of schools, 
However, to obviate this, the city council of Madrid, in February, 1911, approved a 
plan for the reorganization of the schools officially called, until within a short time, 
municipal schools. This plan shows.by means of figures that with the same amount 
of money as expended at present more teachers and better salaries can be obtained 
and 5,000 more children can be enrolled in the schools. This plan was at once sub- 
mitted for the Government’s approval, and recently action has been taken in the 
matter. 
Before the royal decree of March 14, 1918, went into effect many teachers received, 
besides their regular salaries, fees from well-to-do parents for accompanying their 
children to the schools, and this extra payment has met with many protests on the 
part of the parents. “Some of the cities have taken the matter up and agreed to pay 
the teachers the amounts thus received. By the royal decree of March 14, 1913, 
above referred to, the salaries of all grammar-school teachers are raised, the fees are
-P-A-G-E-894
  840 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
suppressed, and nine categories of teachers are established, receiving the following 
salaries: Four thousand pesetas ($720), 3,500 pesetas ($630), 3,000 pesetas ($540), 2,500 
pesetas ($450), 2,000 pesetas ($360), 1,650 pesetas ($297), 1,375 pesetas ($247.50), 1,100 
pesetas ($198), and 1,000 pesetas ($180). More positions for teachers are to be created. 
Many teachers have made complaints against this royal decree, as even with their 
salary increased they would not earn as much as they formerly did with combined 
salary and fees. Asa result, a royal order of April 5, 1913, provides that all teachers 
who would receive less salary by the application of the royal decree of March 14, 1913, 
than they formerly received by salary and fees shall receive the difference from the 
cities and the treasury. 
School census.—Under Spanish law it is compulsory for all children between the ages 
of 6 and 12 years to attend school. Of the 85,713 children of both sexes of school age in 
Madrid, 50,052 attend school; 33,806 receiving their education in private schools and 
16,246 in the public schools, not counting the pupils of the ‘‘C4rcel Modelo,” who are 
generally above the school age, or the pupils in schools for adults. At the end of the 
year 1911, Madrid had 781 schools, of which number 344 were for boys, 361 for girls, 
and 76 for kindergarten children. Of these schools 420 were private and 361 public, 
the latter being classified as those supported by the State, Provinces, cities, and pri- 
vate societies. Among the 420 private schools in Madrid, there are 11 foreign schools. 
One French school for boys, recently inaugurated, and a German school for boys and 
girls are subventioned by their respective countries. Besides these schools there are 
6 French schools for girls and 3 French schools for boys, which are supported by private 
subscriptions. The International Institute, an American school for girls, is supported 
by the Corporation of the International Institute, Boston, Mass. 
New school buildings.—By royal decree.of April 4, 1913, a society was founded under 
the protection of the Queen of Spain, the object of which is to promote the construc- 
tion of new buildings to be used for public schools. The president of the society will 
be the minister of public instruction of Spain, and the vice president, the ‘‘ Director 
General de Primera Ensefianza” (superintendent of primary schools). The other 
members will be a counselor of public instruction, appointed by the minister of public 
instruction; the director of the ‘‘Museo Pedagégico Nacional”; a counselor from the 
“Banco de Espafia,’’ appointed by the director or the bank; and a member of the 
city council of Madrid, appointed by the mayor. A general subscription is to be 
started, and the money obtained will be used in the construction of schools and the 
purchase of land and material for same. The use and care of such buildings, to be 
solely for educational purposes, will be turned over to the city of Madrid. The depart- 
ment of public instruction of Spain contributed 250,000 pesetas ($45,000) during 1913 
toward the construction of schools or ‘purchase of transportable schools; and 25,000 
pesetas ($4,500) will be appropriated annually for the same purpose. The expense 
of purchasing supplies will be paid for by the same department, and all architectural 
work will be done free of charge. 
Night schools for adults.—By royal orders of October 4, 1906, and October 28, 1906, 
and royal decree of May 19, 1911, schools for men were established. By royal decree 
of April 4, 1913, it is provided that schools for women shall be established in Madrid 
(and Barcelona), subject to the same conditions as the schools for men, 100,000 pesetas 
($18,000) being appropriated for their establishment. These schools will be divided 
into two classes; one class will be for illiterate children over 12 years of age, or for 
those who wish to repeat their grammar school education; the other class will be for 
children of the same age who wish to extend their education. The first will be 
taught reading, writing, arithmetic, domestic economy, hygiene, care of children, 
history, geography, literature, and singing, and they will be taken to visit museums, 
etc., on Sundays; illiterate children and those repeating their education will be in 
different divisions; the other pupils will be taught French, typewriting, shorthand, 
commercial practice, and general work. The classes will be held irom 6 to 8 p. m., 
 
-P-A-G-E-895
RECENT EVENTS IN SPAIN. 841 
from October to May, inclusive. The regular teachers will receive the same pay as 
the teachers in the schools for adults; teachers of special subjects will receive 1,500 
pesetas ($270) per year. The department of public instruction is to determine the 
number of classes to be established, take the necessary measures for the appointment. 
of teachers, choose location of schools, and purchase all necessary material. 
New courses for teachers.—Many teachers wish to perfect their education after leaving 
the normal schools, and a royal order dated March 28, 1913, has been published which 
provides that courses to perfect and amplify the studies for grammar-school teachers 
shall be established wherever the department of public instruction decides. These 
courses will comprise lessons on methods of teaching; studies of general scientific and 
artistic culture; visits to the different museums, collections, and libraries; practical 
classes for instruction in the principal matter of the school program, in metheds of 
drawing, singing and playing; and fundamental lectures on education, science, and 
literature. When it is deemed convenient, teachers will be admitted to take notes, 
etc., in the various universities. For the present only 20 male and 20 female teachers 
will be allowed to attend each course. Teachers admitted to the courses will receive 
5 pesetas (90 cents) per day during their stay in the place where the course is given and 
reimbursement for traveling expenses in a round trip of the third class. The depart- 
ment of public instruction will name the:professors to take charge of these courses and 
will determine the amounts to be expended for.excursions, etc. 
    UNIVERSITY MOVEMENTS. 
In a recent address at the Sorbonne, on the opening of a venter of 
“franco-hispanique” studies, Sefior Altamira, reviewing the edu- 
eational reforms in his country, dwelt upon the new spirit manifested 
by the Spanish universities. On this subject, he said: 
The universities are extending their field of action by exchanges with the similar 
institutions of other countries. They are also sending as many students as possible, 
including some on scholarship funds, to study in foreign lands. The traveling scholar- 
ships accorded in 1910 and 1911 numbered respectively 98 and 110; in addition, in 
1911-12 there were accorded 39 scholarships for scientific research. 
Among other proofs of this activity Sefior Altamira noted the found- 
ing of a Spanish school of archeology at Rome, of a new center of 
historic research, and an institute of physical and natural sciences at 
Madrid, and the fact that 58,000 readers during the last year had 
availed themselves of the rich library of the pedagogical museum.? 
The purpose of the Government to bring Spanish universities into 
more intimate relations with those of other countries is emphasized 
by the recent decree relative to the admission of foreign students as 
set forth in the following statement, which comprises an exposition 
addressed to the King of Spain by the minister of public instruction 
pertaining to the recognition of foreign diplomas and the royal decree 
on the subject.

EXPOSITION. 
Sir: The diploma of bachelor of arts represents in Spain, as well as its equivalent 
in other countries, a certain degree of knowledge which embraces the student's gen- 
eral culture and determines his vocation, it being more than anything else an indis- 
pensable preparation for the successful undertaking of higher studies. 
The preparatory character of this degree has, no doubt, shown to countries of so 
high a culture as Germany the propriety of acknowledging the validity of the foreign 
degrees of bachelor of arts; and in England, as well as in France, those who have ob- 
tained this degree in other countries find great facilities for matriculation in the sev- 
eral faculties. 
Spain, on the contrary, has never recognized the validity of such certificates of 
studies, in spite of repeated requests to do so, and for this reason there are in the above- 
mentioned countries perhaps more than 8,000 students from 20 different countries and 
from America and the Philippines who, speaking our own language, possessing our 
own blood, and being identified with our own literature and arts, are not identified 
with our science, since on returning to their own country with a professional diploma 
they bring with them German, English, or French science, because their mother 
country refuses what others grant them. 
Our institutions of learning should be the means by which European science could 
communicate with the countries which once were Spanish. It is necessary, therefore, 
to open our university lecture halls to these foreign students with certain restrictions, 
without denying this privilege to the subjects of other States who have an organized 
curriculum, or to Spaniards who have made their studies abroad. 
The undersigned minister, on having the honor to submit to Your Majesty the fol- 
lowing project of a decree, does not feel actuated by reasons of an economic nature; 
his purpose is only to contribute to the intellectual union with the States which 
received from Spain the baptism of civilization.

ROYAL DECREE. 
In conformity with what has been proposed by the minister of public instructions 
and fine arts, 
I hereby decree as follows: 
Arrticte 1. Diplomas, which in their respective countries are accepted on entrance 
into the several faculties of higher instruction, shall be as valid in Spain as if issued 
in the Kingdom, provided, however, they proceed from an official institution depend- 
ing on the State, and that the authenticity of the same has been proved by means of 
proper legalization or authorized documents, and that the persons possessing such 
diplomas shall be duly identified. 
Arr. 2. The same fees shall be paid for these as are paid for Spanish diplomas of 
bachelor of arts. 
Given at San Sebastian on this the 20th of September, 1913.

  The minister of public instruction and fine arts of Spain announced 
in 1912 the institution of a vacation course for foreigners, comprising 
lectures accompanied by short excursions to be conducted by Spanish 
professors, but under the general direction of Prof. D. Ramon Menen- 
dez Pidal.
-P-A-G-E-897
PORTUGAL, 843 
The detailed program shows that the subjects of the lectures related 
chiefly to the literature of the succeeding centuries from the fifteenth 
to the nineteenth, inclusive, together with current literature. 
The visits to the principal art museums of Madrid, namely, the 
Prado (the national museum of painting and sculpture) and the 
Museum of Modern Art, were directed by Manuel B. Cossio, professor 
of pedagogy in the University of Madrid and director of the National 
Pedagogic Museum; the visits to the Archeological Museum and 
the Royal Armory were under the direction of Sefior Manuel Gomez 
Moreno. Excursions were also organized for Toledo and the Escorial; 
and to Avila and Segovia, under the conduct of Sefior Moreno. 
PORTUGAL. 
The political upheaval which resulted in the overthrow of royal 
power in Portugal and the establishment of the republican form of 
government, proclaimed October 5, 1910, has been attended by rad- 
ical changes in the education laws- and administration. Primary 
education is compulsory, according to a decree of the provisional 
government bearing date, March 29, 1911, and so far as cireum- 
stances permit this decree is rigorously enforced. Official statistics 
for 1911 give a total of 7,120 primary schools, of which 6,320 were 
public. These statistics, which did not include either the enroll- 
ment of pupils or the number of teachers, are the result of a pre- 
liminary endeavor on the part of the Government to find out the 
actual state of the school provision in the country. It need hardly 
be said that many of the school buildings reported are totally unfit 
for their purposes, and it is recognized that before the compulsory — 
law can be fully enforced the number of buildings must be increased 
and efforts made to fit them for the purposes of instruction. The 
condition of the secondary schools is encouraging; these enrolled 
9,749 pupils in 1911, and 10,621 in 1912. In the latter year the 
universities registered 2,673 students; the School of Fine Arts at 
Lisbon, 963; and the Military Academy, 352. 
The current discussions respecting education are indicated by a 
bill which was presented to the Legislature during the present session, 
having for its purpose the establishment of a new order of schools 
termed ‘Jardins d’Adoiescents,” i. e., schools for children from the 
ages of 6 to 18, in cities having more than 30,000 inhabitants. 
The proposition recalls the interest long manifested by represent- 
ative men and women in Portugal in the idea of education as a 
training of the whole nature, under conditions favorable to the highest 
development of body and mind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-898
  844 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The draft of the law is introduced by a review of present conditions 
in Portugal and a synopsis of the principles of Pestalozzi, of Girard, 
and others. The proposed schools are to be organized upon the 
model of the ‘‘new schools,” which have sprung up in different 
countries of Europe since the original experiment’ was made at 
Abbotsholme, England. The author of the bill, Sr. Pinto, says: 
The new school should be an institution established by private initiative or that 
of a municipality, situated near a city, at a distance of not more than 15 or 20 minutes 
ride by cars, and furnished with all the equipment required for physical education, 
scientific training (museum, laboratories, etc.), aesthetic culture (painting, music, 
singing), and social training (industries, community life). 
The foreign schools of this order, ‘‘gardens for adolescents” as they are often called, 
are intended for secondary education; but with us, since there are no infant schools 
that can prepare for such an institution, the new school, temporarily at least, should 
take children at an early age, that is to say, 6 years, and retain them through the period 
of adolescence; that is, up to the age of 18 years, 
The draft of the bill was accompanied by an outline of the organi- 
zation of the proposed schools. As examples of the system in oper- 
ation, Sr. Pinto mentions besides Abbotsholme, Sunlight in England, 
Les Roches, in France; Haubinda, Ilsenburg, and Bieberstein, in 
Germany. 
ITALY. 
MOVEMENTS PERTAINING TO ELEMENTARY EDUCATION, 
The purpose of the Italian Government to extend and equalize 
the provision of elementary schools throughout the country was 
indicated by the passage of the act of June 4, 1911, which transferred 
the school administration from communal to provincial authorities 
in the case of communes in which more than 25 per cent of the 
inhabitants were illiterate. This act was followed by special appro- 
priations to aid communes in building schoolhouses and by increased 
appropriations for the support of schools. The expenditure by the 
State for elementary education, which was 5,756,171 lire ($1,110,941) 
in 1903-4, reached 26,791,116 lire ($5,170,685) in 1911. The total 
appropriation for education for 1912-13 amounted to 138,700,000 
lire ($26,769,100), of which 56,000,000 lire ($10,808,000) was for 
primary education, including ordinary and extraordinary expendi- 
tures. It was expressly ordered by the act confirming this appro- 
priation that 45,000,000 lire ($8,685,000) should be used to insure the 
appointment of new teachers or to increase the salaries of those in the 
service. This provision was necessary, since, as a result of the 
multiplication of schoolhouses, about 4,000 schools are in charge of 
untrained teachers, and 403 buildings are closed from want of teachers.
-P-A-G-E-899
ITALY. 845 
It may be recalled that, in view of the dearth of schools in southern 
and central Italy, an act of 1906 made provision for 18,000 new 
schools in these sections, at an expenditure of above 18,000,000 lire 
($3,600,000), of which 11,000,000 was contributed by the State and 
the remainder by the communes. 
The importance of increasing the provision for primary instruc- 
tion was emphasized by the fact that at the election which took 
place November 2 of the present year, the first under the electoral 
law of June 30, 1912, a large proportion of the five and one-half mil- 
lion new voters were illiterate. The electoral law referred to made 
the suffrage universal for men, excepting only those under 30 years 
of age who have neither performed their military service nor learned 
to read and write. The increase of illiterate voters was largely 
from the southern Provinces of Italy; in one village, it is said, not a 
single elector was found able to read and write on polling day. In 
view of this condition the Premier declared that ‘the shame of 
illiteracy can no longer be neglected.” The determination of the 
Government to eliminate the evil is indicated by the continued ap- 
propriation for building schoolhouses, which carries about $15,000,000 
to be expended in this work in the periotl 1913-17. 
The actual extent of school-attendance throughout the Kingdom 
is not known, as school statistics are only reported quinquennially, 
the last bearing date 1907-8, but it is certain that since that year 
school facilities and school attendance have been increased in the 
Provinces that were extremely backward. 
ILLITERACY. 
The movement for extending popular education is not related solely 
to children of school age. The problem of adult illiteracy has excited 
special attention throughout the last decade, by reason of the alarming 
revelations of the census of 1901.. At that time 48 per cent of the 
people above 10 years of age could not read, the only other European 
countries standing so low in this respect being Spain, with 58 per 
cent of illiterates, and Russia, with 70. Public-spirited men and 
women throughout Italy joined in a movement for ridding their 
country of this evil; and the census of 1911, just published, shows 
decided improvement, the ratio of adult illiterates having fallen’ 
to 30.8 per cent for the entire Kingdom. Piedmont, in the north- 
west, shows the lowest ratio, viz, 2.9 per cent; and Calabria, in the 
extreme south, the highest, 63.6 per cent. Even here there has 
been a reduction, as in 1901 the proportion of illiterates in the popu- 
lation above 6 years of age was 78.7.

    846 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
EDUCATION OF EMIGRANTS. 
The efforts for overcoming adult illiteracy have been promoted 
by the interest in the condition of emigrants who, in ever-increasing 
numbers, depart for new fields of labor in Europe and on the Amer- 
ican Continent. In 1901, a commission was established under the 
ministry of foreign affairs for the direction of the Government service 
relating to emigration. The first efforts of this commission were 
directed to the physical welfare of the emigrants, and a service of 
sanitary inspection was instituted and a medical officer assigned to 
every emigrant ship for the oversight of the Italian contingent during 
the passage. The movement for giving special instruction to emi- 
grants, which was described somewhat in detail in the previous report 
of this series, was started by private societies; it has grown to large 
proportions and has been brought under the general supervision 
of the Government. At the opening of a course of instruction estab- 
lished at Rome for teachers who are sent to the ports where emigrants 
are detained for inspection and instruction, the Italian commissioner 
of emigration gave an address on the growth of this movement, in 
which he carefully distinguished between the part which the State 
can perform in this respect and the activities of private societies. 
He said in part: 
Already we can perceive the dawn of the‘emancipation of the emigrant, symbolized 
in Italy by the formation of tutelary associations, supported by the emigrants them- 
selves and by a press specialized in the interests of the emigrants; and, outside of Italy, 
by the creation of nuclei of the emigrated and their descendants, who are conscious 
of their strength and proud of the glorious past of the race from which they sprang. 
These germs, from which a superior form of tutelage is bound to evolve, need help, 
but this help can not all be derived from the State. This may develop its own action 
with the development of the popular school understood in the ampler sense of the word. 
WELFARE ACTIVITIES. 
Social science has received much attention in the universities of 
Italy, which explains, in part, the many practical efforts undertaken 
for the amelioration of social conditions, and the union of philanthropy 
and scientific method which marks these efforts. This combination 
is shown in the establishment of open-air colonies for delicate children 
of the poorer classes. The first attempt of this-kind was made in 
December, 1902, at Padua, by the committee for the campaign 
against tuberculosis. The president of the committee was a senator, 
Achille de Giovanni, who was also a professor at the University of 
Padua. At Barbarano, a suburb of Padua, a site was secured on the 
southern slope of the Berici hills, and here, in a pavilion large enough 
to accommodate 10 children and the director, the first colony was 
established. Soon after, by the aid of a subsidy from the city of 
Padua, two more pavilions were added and the number of children
-P-A-G-E-901
ITALY. 847 
increased to 30. A second colony was established in the autumn 
of 1905, on an elevation on the outskirts of the city of Padua, the 
Red Cross society giving tents and the benevolent associations sup- 
plying the furniture and current expenses. This autumnal colony, 
called Ricreatorio per fanciulli deboli, was under the direction of Dr. 
. Allessandro Randi, chief of the medical service of the city. Here 54 
children, from 5 to 12 years of age, were received during the months 
of September and October; they were kept in the open-air eight hours 
a day the first month, and six hours a day the second month, and 
were fed twice daily during the former period and once daily during 
the latter period. The children were selected by a special committee 
from the pupils of the primary school, and when the Ricreatorio was 
closed for the winter the physicians in charge continued the over- 
sight of them at their homes, assisted by one of the school inspectors. 
These colonies were not intended for instruction, but for physical 
recuperation, and it was not until 1907 that school exercises were 
commenced under the charge of a regular teacher. The classes were 
so managed that delicate children in the ordinary schools could be 
sent in groups of 30 to spend an hour a day in the open air. 
In the period 1907-1911 provision for similar colonies was made 
by three other cities, Milan, Rome, and Genoa, and although in every 
case the primary purpose has been to promote the health and physical 
strength of delicate children, provision for class instruction has be- 
come a feature of the work. The results of these recuperative col- 
onies and open-air classes have led to a vigorous campaign in behalf 
of open-air schools similar to those in Germany, England, and the 
United States. The ardent champion of this cause, Prof. Lauriti, has 
aroused great interest by his articles published in the Tempo and 
other journals of Italy, which have won to the support of the cause 
_ Imany representative men, including the minister of public instruction, 
Sefior Credaro. The movement merges into the larger question of 
school reform, which is exciting great attention throughout Italy. 
As regards -the early period of training, this interest is fostered by the 
Unione Nazionale Educatrict Infanzia; and as regards the period of 
adolescence it is promoted by the university faculties of pedagogy, 
which, as a rule, are in full sympathy with the modern scientific 
movement with its emphasis upon the psychological and biological 
relations of educational processes. 
PROMOTION OF AGRICULTURE. 
The great importance of agricultural education in Italy is indicated 
by the fact that 92 per cent of the entire area is productive, and ac- 
cording to the census of 1901, out of a total population numbering 
25,386,507 above 9 years of age, 9,611,003 (37 per cent) were engaged 
in agriculture, forestry, and cattle rearing.
-P-A-G-E-902
848 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The interest of the Government in promoting agriculture was indi- 
eated by the endeavor made nearly a decade ago to establish an inter- 
national institute of agriculture, which, after extended correspondence 
with foreign countries, was successfully achieved in 1905. At that 
time 40 Governments entered into the agreement, and 10 others have 
since become signatories, so that the institute now includes nearly the 
whole civilized world. It is a Government institution in which each 
adhering power is represented by delegates of its choice; the work is 
earried on by a general assembly and a permanent committee. The 
scope of the institute, which is situated at Rome, is indicated by its 
organization, comprising: 
(1) A bureau of general statistics for the collection, coordination, 
and publication of statistical data pertaining to agricultural subjects. 
This bureau publishes a monthly bulletin of agricultural statistics and 
an international yearbook of the same character; also from time to 
time monographs on questions of current interest. 
(2) Bureau of agricultural intelligence and plant diseases. This 
bureau also publishes a monthly bulletin pertaining to its specific 
inquiries. ; 
(3) Bureau of economic and social intelligence. This bureau col- 
lects and publishes information on economic questions affecting agri- 
culture, especially such as relate to agricultural cooperation, insurance, 
and eredit; and, like the other divisions, publishes a monthly bulletin 
and from time to time special monographs on the subjects that come 
within its province. 
The library of the institute publishes a weekly bibliographical bulle- 
tin and also a yearbook of agricultural legislation, and promises to 
become a most complete depository of bibliographical documentary 
literature pertaining to agriculture. : 
The commission appointed by President Wilson to investigate and 
study rural credits and agricultural cooperative organizations in 
European countries found in Italy a rich center for the study of va- 
rious forms of cooperative associations and rural finance. ' A system 
of partnership between proprietors and cultivators is highly devel- 
oped in Tuscany and Umbria; and the savings bank of Florence, one 
of the greatest institutions of the kind in Europe, is specially noted 
for the volume and method of its land-credit business. 
At Milan the attention of the commission was directed to the coop- 
erative institutions for which Italy is noted, while the surrounding 
country afforded opportunity for studying the methods of intensive 
cultivation applied to wheat, corn, and silk breeding. The great 
productiveness of the Province of Lombardy is attributed to the sys- 
tem of irrigation, which utilizes the water of near-by lakes, and also 
in enormous quantities the sewage waste of the city. 
The Italian Government has adopted a plan for reclaiming the 
Pontine marshes, and it is hoped that within the next 10 years they
-P-A-G-E-903

may be brought under cultivation. The Government is to provide 
about a million and a half dollars for the enterprise, and the pro- 
prietors the rest of the required funds. 
SCHOOLS OF AGRICULTURE. 
  In accordance with an act of June 6, 1885, schools of agriculture 
are under the supervision of the minister of agriculture, industry, and 
commerce. They are established either by communal or provincial 
authorities, which provide an experimental farm and two-fifths of the 
expenses of the school, the State bearing the other three-fifths. Hach 
school is managed by a committee whose members are appointed 
partly by the Government and partly by the local authorities sharing 
in the expenses. The schools are classified as practical and special. 
The course of study for the former covers three years and includes, 
besides the elementary branches, geometry, surveying, drawing, ac- 
counts, natural and physical sciences, and agriculture. Sometimes a 
fourth year is added for practical work. Boys are admitted at 14 
years of age, but not after the age of 17. 
The special schools of agriculture are of two grades. Those of the 
first grade are organized like the practical schools, but the agricultural 
training relates to a particular branch, as dairying, horticulture, and 
vine-raising. The schools of the second grade, four in number, are all 
devoted to vine-raising and wine making, and their admission require- 
ments are similar to those of the secondary technical schools. 
In 1912 there were 30 practical schools, having 1,120 students, and 
7 special schools, with 533 students. 
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The year has been marked by discussions in the public press and 
in the legislature relative to the condition of secondary education 
and the wants of the universities. In this connection it may be 
recalled that in 1906 a royal commission was appointed to investi- 
gate the entire field of secondary education. The report of this 
commission included a proposal that the secondary schools should 
be organized in two grades, the first grade covering a period of three 
years, and comprising three divisions, as follows: 
(1) Ginnasio, intended as a preparatory division for higher sec- 
ondary schools, i. e., licei, having a five-year course leading directly 
to the universities. 
(2) A technical division, scwola technica, preparing for a higher- 
grade technical school. 
(83) Scuola complementare, corresponding to the French higher 
primary school, intended to complete the course of elementary edu- 
cation.

-P-A-G-E-904
    850 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
This proposition has been under discussion for nearly two years, 
but without definite results; it is interesting to note its resemblance 
to the plan of junior and senior colleges adopted in some places in 
the United States. 
During the scholastic year 1912-13, the number of students regis- 
tered in the Italian universities was 20,708, distributed as shown in 
the table below. There were also 153 persons who attended without 
having matriculated, making a total of 20,861. The University of 
Naples led, with 3,785 students, which is 500 less than the number 
in the previous year. Rome followed, with 2,895, an increase of 
about 40 over the previous year. 
It is noticeable that comparatively few foreign students resort to 
the Italian universities. The total number of such students for 
the year reviewed was 228 regularly subscribed, and 11 attending 
lectures. The number of women students was 2,093. 
The complaint is made in Italy of the excessive number of univer- 
sities, several of which suffer from insufficient resources; the propo- 
sition has repeatedly been made to convert the smaller universities 
into higher-grade secondary schools, or into specialized schools 
adapted to the needs of their localities, but provincial pride has thus 
far rendered such action impossible. 
In addition to the universities, there are 11 private institutes for 
higher education, of which the most important are at Milan and 
Florence. The others are special institutions of engineering, veter- 
inary medicine, etc. The total number of students in these institutes 
in 1912-13 was 3,988, including 87 auditors.

THE KINGDOMS OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE. 
In the Kingdoms of southeastern Europe all internal develop- 
ments were stopped by the Balkan War. The only educational 
events of which recent information has reached this bureau relate to 
schools under foreign auspices in the Turkish Empire. 
MODERN SCHOOLS IN TURKEY. 
The reform of education in Turkey proposed by the Young Turk 
Party had not passed the paper stage when the Balkan War broke 
out, ending for the time all efforts in that direction. The schools of 
the mosques continue their instruction in the Koran and in ele- 
mentary arithmetic as usual; in Constantinople the secondary 
schools, modeled generally after the French lycée, and a few special 
schools—the Imperial School of Medicine, Imperial Art School, 
Greek National School, and the Greek Theological Seminary—are 
still in operation. 
For modern education the Turkish Empire depends almost entirely 
upon schools of the Roman Catholic and Protestant missions, which 
are found in the principal towns of Turkey in Europe and Turkey 
in Asia, and which, even in the former division, continued operations 
wherever possible during the period of war. 
Robert College-—Robert College, Constantinople, maintained its 
work while the war raged, without interruption and with little 
diminution of numbers. Through the legacy of $2,500,000 from the 
estate of Mr. John S. Kennedy, of New York, the college was placed 
upon a solid basis in 1910, and extensive building plans were at once 
adopted and are still in process of execution. The latest published 
report from the institution covers the forty-eighth year of its oper- 
ation, which closed August 1, 1911. The number of students for 
that year was 427, representing 17 nationalities: The Greeks led, 
with 198 students; and the Bulgarians, Armenians, and Turks were 
represented by 68, 62, and 61, respectively. Of the remainder, 16 
were Israelites; other nationalities had small representation, ranging 
from 1 to 5 students. Among the religions represented were Greek 
Orthodox, Protestant, Moslem, Jewish, Greek Catholic, Roman 
Catholic, Armenian, and Syrian Catholic. 
The teaching force is even more cosmopolitan than the student 
body, but the larger proportion of the members are Americans, 
graduates of American universities and colleges, native teachers 
being employed chiefly for language instruction, though all the 
regular class exercises are conducted in English. 
President Gates has been wonderfully successful in infusing the 
American spirit into the college activities, which is promoted also 
by the possession of a gymnasium and athletic field; the exercises of 
 
-P-A-G-E-906
852 EDUCATION REPORT, ‘1913, 
  Founder’s Day recall similar exercises in the United States, the 
serious part of the program being enlivened by college songs, athletic 
exercises, etc. 
Robert College is undoubtedly the most prominent institution of 
learning in the Ottoman Empire. In the opinion of all authorities 
familiar with movements in that country, it has done more than any 
other one agency to raise up leaders among the races of the Empire 
and the adjoining States. Naturally, there is much rivalry in the 
institution, but each year tends to lessen hostile feelings among the 
students. A striking testimonial to its unifying influence, as well as 
that of the American College for Girls, is given by Sir Edwin Pears, 
an Englishman long resident at Constantinople, in his recent work, 
“Turkey and its People.’’ This writer attributes the transformation 
that has taken place in the minds of educated and thoughtful Moslems 
to the gradual infiltration of modern ideas through the work mainly 
of these two institutions. 
The affairs of Robert College are directed by an American board, 
of which Mr. Cleveland H. Dodge, of New York. is the president, 
and Rev. Edward B. Cole, D. D., secretary. 
The American College for Girls at Constantinople is in the process 
of removal from the site near Scutari, on the Asiatic side of the 
Bosphorus, to a fine position on the heights of Anaaout Keuy on the 
European side, 6 miles from Constantinople. The erection of the 
new buildings was begun in 1910, and the preparatory department 
was transferred to the new quarters in 1911; the work on the college 
buildings has since been rapidly pushed. The main group will con- 
sist of seven buildings, including Gould Hall, the administration 
office, the gift of Helen Miller Gould; the science building, Henry 
Wards Hall, the gift of another American woman; two dormitories, 
one the gift of John D. Rockefeller, who also furnished the power 
plant. All departments will be equipped after the best model of 
American colleges. Money has been freely contributed by friends 
in America to carry out the structural plans, but these emphasize 
anew the need of endowment funds for the maintenance of the edu- 
cational work itself, which at present depends largely upon voluntary 
subscriptions. 
This institution was opened in 1871 as a high school under the 
charge of the woman’s board of home missions, Boston, Mass. In 
1890, the standard of scholarship having been approved by the 
State legislature as sufficient, the school was incorporated as a 
college by “act of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ;” and under 
the presidency of Dr. Mary Mills Patrick, assisted by a strong faculty, 
it has well sustained its enlarged responsibility. 
. Candidates for admission to the freshman class of the college must 
pass an examination which includes English, geography, arithmetic
-P-A-G-E-907
    
THE KINGDOMS OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE. 853 
and algebra, history, French or German, and a classical language or 
vernacular. The regular college course leading to the bachelor’s 
degree extends over four years; candidates for the degree must com- 
plete before graduation the equivalent of 60 one-hour courses, of 
which a certain number are required and the rest elective. 
The student body is thoroughly cosmopolitan, including at the 
present time some 17 nationalities, principally Turks, Bulgarians, 
Armenians, and Greeks. The college enjoys the confidence of the 
Government, which, during the last year, was supporting several 
Mohammedan students, who were under promise to teach in Gov- 
ernment schools after graduation. The need of young women pre- 
pared for teaching is very great in the Turkish Empire, over 12,000 
being required to meet the demands, for which only about 500 
women are available. The college, therefore, hopes to secure funds 
for the support of a professional school after the model of Teachers 
College, New York City. Instruction in manual arts and crafts, in 
household arts, and in hygiene and sanitation is another urgent 
requirement of Turkish women at the present time. One of the 
professors of the college has arranged for general lectures to be 
given to women on these subjects by well-known physicians and 
experts. 
The graduates of the college number 124, representing 14 different 
nationalities. Mohammedan students, who were formerly prohibited 
from attending an institution of this character, now form a large 
element of the student body, and two adherents of this religion have 
already graduated. 
This institution, like Robert College, is under the charge of an 
American board, of whom the acting president is Grace H. Dodge, 
of New York, and the secretary, Samuel C. Darling. 
Syria forms a part of the Turkish Empire in Asia, covering an area 
of 114,530 square miles, with a population of 3,675,100. It com- 
prises six vilayets (districts), with populations ranging from 200,000 
in Lebanon to 1,500,000 in Aleppo. In this division of the Empire 
French influence predominates. Primary schools, secondary and 
higher schools, have multiplied, and have brought to the Syrians 
through the medium of the French language an occidental civilization 
which is superposed upon the old Arabian civilization. = 
Beirut is the center from which modern knowledge, ideas, and liberal 
aspirations are diffused throughout this Province. Among the noted 
institutions of this city are the Syrian Protestant College and the 
Catholic University of St. Joseph. The former was chartered under 
the laws of the State of New York on April 24, 1863, and opened in 
1866 as an interdenominational institution. It includes at present 
a preparatory department, collegiate department, medical school, 
and a school of commerce. - Plans for schools of law, engineering,

and agriculture have been approved by the trustees and will be 
begun as soon as adequate funds are secured. The direction of the 
affairs of the institution is vested in a board of trustees in New York 
City, of which the president is Mr. D. 8. Dodge. 
The University of St. Joseph, at Beirut, is a Catholic institution 
which received the Papal sanction in 1881, and, under the charge of 
the fathers of the Order of St. Joseph, has maintained vigorous 
existence to the present time. This institution is formed after 
French models, including both secondary and university departments. 
The oriental faculty has been especially distinguished for the erudi- 
tion of its graduates, and the large alumni association includes many 
eminent scientists and oriental specialists.

RUSSIA. 
CoNTENTS.—StatisticS of primary schools, 1911; the primary education bill; commercial education; agri- 
cultural education, 
The Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1912 contained 
a brief survey of education in Russia, including the organization of 
the public system and an account of pending legislation as related in 
particular to primary education. Since that report was published 
the Russian census of 1911 has been issued, and according to the 
Statesman’s Year-Book presents the following statistics of primary 
schools throughout the Empire:

The foregoing table shows increase in the total of primary schools 
and enrollment above that reported for 1910-11 in the Russian year- 
book; for the enrollment the increase amounts to nearly 2,000,000 
pupils. The figures may not be entirely accurate, as, from the ex- 
tent and character of the Empire and the imperfect statistical meth- 
ods, it is hardly possible to show the status of primary schools from 
year to year; but the general development, political and social, for 
example, the growing independence and activity of the zemstvos 
(county authorities) and the efforts for the improvement of the rural 
communities, and furthermore the support given in the Duma to 
the bill for compulsory education, make it certain that provision for 
primary education is rapidly extending. 
THE PRIMARY EDUCATION BILL. 
In 1911 the Third State Duma approved a project of a proposed law 
in regard to universal primary education in Russia. This proposal 
was sent up to the Council of State in January, 1912, but the Right 
855 
 
-P-A-G-E-910
856 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Party of the council made drastic changes in the propositions of the 
projected law which were not accepted by the Duma, and therefore 
the bill was virtually rejected. 
The conflict between the cabinet ministers and the Fourth Duma 
during the present year has prevented any progress in legislation 
affecting public education. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
Among the modern movements that are taking place in Russia, 
special importance attaches to the provision for commercial and 
agricultural education. 
The commercial schools of Russia are established either by the mer- 
chant societies of cities or by private individuals, but they are under 
the control of the Ministry of Trade,and Industry. 
The following information pertaining to this class of special schools 
is derived from a recent consular report on the subject: *

  The following shows the-grouping of pupils by nationalities: Russians, 33,030; 
Poles, 12,220; other Slavs, 185; total, 45,435. The Hebrew pupils numbered 20,136; 
Germans, 2,957; Lithuanians, 2,703; other nationalities and pupils concerning whom 
no information has been obtained, 6,695. 
The expenses for running the schools amounted in 1911 to $ 
revenues were $5,312,298, thus leaving a surplus of $23,246. 
The principal source of revenue of the schools is the tuition fees, which represent 
about 93 per cent of the same. 
The special courses are similarly placed, 89.9 per cent being covered by fees. De- 
scending in the scale of types, the importance of these fees decreases; in the case of 
commercial schools it is 62.1 per cent, and in trade schools 51 per cent. In private 
commercial colleges the fees make 86.3 per cent, and in the schools 99.8 per cent. 
Nonprivate institutions are to a high degree dependent on fees for diplomas and 
certificates, viz, 12.8 per cent in the case of the higher type, 8 per cent in that of trade 
classes, and 5.9 per cent in that of schools. 
This last-named source of income does not apply to colleges of the highest (or uni- 
versity type), nor to courses on special subjects. 
Another source of revenue is the school tax on trade certificates. The Government 
treasury gives but very slight assistance to the schools, about 14 per cent of the revenues. 
  89,052, while the

RUSSIA, 857 
Of the 399 schools, only 73 have their own buildings, the value of which amounts 
to $6,500,000. These figures afford a clue to the importance of the various types of 
institutions in the minds of the Russian merchant and business man himself. 
Another matter of interest is the social class from which the various 
groups of students are drawn. The total is derived by 10.8 per cent 
from gentlemen’s families, by 1.1 per cent from those of clergymen, 
and 16.3 per cent from professional circles, by 43.2 per cent from the 
lower middle classes, by 23 per cent from peasants, by 4.7 per cent 
from miscellaneous sources, and 1.1 per cent is contributed by 
foreigners. 
Thus, the middle class furnishes the largest per cent of students, 
not only for all the institutions, but for each type taken individu- 
ally, with the sole“exception of the trade classes; in these the peasants 
lead, with 43.3 per cent of all the students. 
These data point to the conclusion that commercial training is 
most in demand by the inferior type of business men, affording as it 
does a preparation for the intended calling as well as a form of general 
education, while the higher classes lay greater stress on general 
education and erudition. The consular report says: 
Instudying the history of these commercial institutions, two striking features appear, 
first, the fast and uninterrupted growth of the institutions of middle and lower type, 
most rapid since 1899—though 1895 already indicated the coming ascendancy—and 
second, the circumstance that the chief item in the budget is formed by the fees of 
the students. These two factors are full of significance, as they point to the awakening 
and increasing activity of the Russian merchants. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
  The following information in regard to agricultural education in 
Russia is derived from the official reports of the department of agri- 
culture, covering the period 1902-1912, inclusive :* 
  Up to last year statistics in connection with agricultural schools were only published 
at lengthy intervals. Now, however, in view of the steady increase in the number 
of such schools and the importance of the sums expended upon them by the Govern- 
ment and the zemstvos (county authorities), the interest displayed by the public 
in the results attained has grown to such an extent that from now on the Government 
proposes to issue annual statements as to the activities of the schools. 
Some years back the agricultural schools scattered throughout Russia were depend- 
ent on several ministr For instance, the ministries of justice, interior, agricultural 
and imperial domains all had schools within their jurisdiction. During the last 
two years this has been changed and all the agricultural schools in Russia are now 
dependent upon the ministry of agriculture. : 
During the period from 1910 to January 1, 1912, the number of agricultural educa- 
tional institutions under the jurisdiction of the ministry of agriculture increased 
from 239 to 281. These institutions can be grouped as follows: Higher grade, 5; 
middle grade, 15; lower grade, 152; practical schools, 65; primary schools, 13; agri- 
cultural reformatory schools, 9; childrens’ homes, 
          ther agricultural courses, 19.       
1 Information forwarded from the American Embassy    St. Petersburg, March, 1913.
-P-A-G-E-912
858 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
In 1899 the number of schools was 133. During the year ending January 1, 1912, 
47 new educational institutions began work and 5 were closed. The latter were all 
private institutions in receipt of subsidies from the treasury. 
As regards the cost of the schools, the final total of grants made during 1911 for 
meeting the requirements of 255 educational institutions was 5,295,741 rubles (United 
States equivalent, $2,727,307); of this tofal the treasury grants amounted to 2,721,661 
rubles ($1,401,656), and allotments from the zemstvos and other public bodies to 
1,128,186 rubles ($581,016). The fees paid by students, and income from sale of 
products of the schools, together with other special receipts, amounted to 1,446,894 
rubles ($745,150). In 1899 the total expenditure from all sources on agricultural 
education was 2,076,499 rubles ($1,069,397). Of the grants made by the treasury 
during the year ending January 1, 1912, 1,395,310 rubles ($718,585) went to 47 Gov- 
ernment institutions, and the balance of 1,326,351 rubles ($683,071) represents 
subsidies to 191 schools belonging to zemstvos, social bodies, and private persons. 
Some idea of the way in which the money requirements of the agricultural schools 
are growing may be obtained from an examination of the following figures: 
Income of agricultural schools.

Grants from the treasury (rubles) United States equivalent. . Income from other sources (rubles) . 2,407, 704 
United States equivalent... $1, 239, 866 | $1): $87, 845 
  
From this it will be seen that the treasury during the year 1911 increased its partici- 
pation in the support of agricultural schools to the extent of 41 per cent. 
Since 1910 the department of agriculture has begun to assist zemstvos in supporting 
low-grade schools by means of simultaneous grants for their equipment. 
The expenses in connection with the running of agricultural schools during 1911 
amounted to 3,982,818 rubles (United States equivalent, $2,051,151). Unfortunately, 
no accurate comparison of expenses can be made with previous years, owing to lack 
of statistics. The following figures, however, will be of interest as showing the aver- 
age growth of expenses in connection with the various categories of agricultural

The increases noticeable in the expenses are attributable to the application of the 
resolution as to agricultural education imperially confirmed on May 26, 1904. This 
resolution provided for a substantial increase in the remuneration of the personnel, 
attaining in some cases as much as 100 per cent. 
The cost of the personnel of the schools and the expenses in connection with teach- 
ing—for which purpose the treasury grants are generally made—represent about one- 
half of the total expenses of the schools.

As regards the number of scholars attending the schools and courses, available sta- 
tistics show that on January 1, 1912, there were 16,137 students attending 253 agricul- 
tural institutions, as against 10,237 attending 185 schools in 1909 and 5,992 attending 
133 schools in 1899. During 1911 there was an average of 63 students for each school, 
as against 55 in 1909, an increase which has, beyond doubt, resulted in reducing the 
annual cost of educating each student. Notwithstanding the great increase in the 
number of those attending the agricultural schools, a demand for a substantial increase — 
in the number of schools is still great, as is strikingly shown by the number of would-be 
students who could not gain admission. In 1909, 6,303 persons requested admission 
to the schools; of this number, however, only 2,925 were taken—that is, 49 per cent. 
In 1911 the number of petitions for entrance to the schools was 15,929, of which only 
6,150 were granted; in other words, hardly 39 per cent. In this respect the following 
figures will be of interest:

  In recent years there has arisen a great demand for men with a middle-grade agri- 
cultural education, and this has had the effect of increasing the number of those 
desirous of entering the middle-grade schools. This class of school is now making 
every effort to accommodate as many students as possible; its endeavors in this direc- 
tion resulted in an average of 195 pupils accommodated by each middle-grade school 
during 1911, whereas in 1909 the average number of students getting instruction at 
these schools was 145, 
During 1911, 1,918 students graduated from the agricultural schools. In the year 
ending January 1, 1912, the number of peasant children at the schools increased by 
9 per cent; they represented 62 per cent of the total number of students, as against 53 
per cent in 1909. For the most part this increase affected the lower-grade schools. 
As to the present activities of former pupils, the agricultural department was able 
to obtain particulars in regard to 76 per cent of the graduates, The following figures 
will show how these latter at present are employed:

From the above it will be seen that 54 per cent are employed in agricultural pursuits 
and 6 per cent have taken to teaching, for the most part in the low-grade agricultural 
schools. If it is assumed that half of the 24 per cent of the graduates of whom no 
statistics are available are engaged in farming, that half of the 4 per cent continuing 
their studies are doing so at agricultural schools, and that half of the 2 per cent serv- 
ing with the colors will eventually adopt agriculture as their profession, we find that 
70 per cent of the graduates from all the agricultural schools in Russia are engaged on 
the land.

  ASIA. 
The movement of modern education in Asia presents three phases 
of great interest. In Japan, China, and Siam it is a movement of 
internal origin; in India it is the outcome of foreign dominion; while 
elsewhere in this vast continent modern schools have been established 
by missionary effort or are the outcome of commercial and imperia 
advance. : 
The following statements comprise information respecting modern 
education in the different divisions of Asia, which has been received 
at this office since the publication of the Commissioner’s Report for 
JAPAN. 
The establishment of a system of modern education in Japan is one 
of the most notable achievements of the nineteenth century. The 
endeavor was of native origin, and although fostered at the beginning 
by foreign experts whose assistance was sought by the Government, s 
it soon passed almost completely under native direction; hence, the 
new order of education was assimilated without violent disturbance 
of old ideas and institutions, and derived support from the principles | 
of patriotism and reverential regard for imperial authority which the | 
old education had imparted. For the reason also that modern edu- 
cation in Japan is essentially scientific, there. was no clash between it 
and the traditional ethical or religious teachings; nor has there been 
any attempt to substitute European classics for the oriental in the 
higher schools; so that modern education appears as an offshoot 
from the old root, an indigenous growth rather than an exotic. 
The system of public education is as thoroughly organized as the 
French system, and is more completely unified than the latter, since 
861
-P-A-G-E-916
  862 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
not only all institutions for general education, but also industrial and 
technical schools are included in the province of the ministry of pub- 
lic instruction. 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
As regards primary education, the salient features of the system are 
the completeness of the school census, the efficient inspection service, 
and the large provision for the training of teachers. From these con- 
ditions it follows that year by year close watch is kept over the move- 
ment of the school population; close relations are established between 
individual schools and the central authority; and the teachers have a 
recognized professional standing. 
Statistics for 1910-11, the latest published, show that 98 per cent 
of all the children of school age (6 to 14) had followed or were following 
the prescribed course of instruction. The compulsory law provides 
that all children must attend school six years of the eight covered 
by the legal school period. As kindergartens are specially recognized 
in the system of Japan, a large part of the children are also under 
supervision from the ages of 3 to 6 years. 
The elementary schools are classified as ordinary and higher, the 
former covering the six years of compulsory school attendance; 
supplementary classes may be maintained in connection with schools 
of either division for pupils who for any reason have been unable 
to complete the course of study in regular grade. The following 
table comprises salient particulars respecting the elementary schools:

  MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA, 863 
' Every city, town, or village is obliged to establish and maintain 
elementary schools with sufficient accommodations for the children 
of school age within their respective areas. Teachers are appointed 
by local authorities from candidates who have submitted to the 
required tests and secured a license. These tests are conducted 
according to two methods, viz, without examination and by examina- 
tion. The tests by examination are held at least once in each year, 
while the tests without examination are held at any time, as occasion 
may require. 
The license is granted by the governors of Fu or Ken (Provinces) 
to those who have been successful in the test for elementary-school 
teachers, or to graduates of schools approved by the minister of 
state for education, or graduates of normal schools. The validity 
of this license is restricted to the Fu or Ken where they have. been 
granted. 
The governors of the Fu or Ken, who are appointed by the Emperor, 
are responsible for the educational affairs of their jurisdictions, but 
in each of these divisions and also in the subdivisions (guns) the 
minister of education is represented by inspectors selected by exami- 
nation. These officials report directly to the central authority. 
The support of elementary schools is derived largely from local 
revenues, but the contributions from the State have been recently 
increased. 
As regards the course of study and the internal conduct of the 
schools, the local authorities are guided by official instructions; 
these are chiefly advisory, but in respect to a few matters are manda- 
tory. Thus the textbooks and charts for elementary schools, which 
relate to morals, the Japanese language, arithmetic, Japanese history, 
geography, science, and drawing, must be publications the copyright 
of which is held by the department. As to other textbooks, they 
may be works either copyrighted by the department of education, 
or examined and approved by the minister, and the local governors 
have the right of choosing from among them. 
Special stress is placed upon school hygiene, and medical inspection 
is maintained over all schools under the immediate control of the 
department of education and over the public schools of the Provinces. 
The report for 1911-12 states that: 
In all Fu and Ken they began to take pains as to measures for school hygiene and 
to pay attention to gymnastics, exercise, sport, etc., of children and pupils. At the 
same time meetings of school physicians were called, that they might discuss and 
investigate all matters relating to school hygiene—or give lectures on health to the 
parents and relatives of pupils—and children, and, in union with the efforts of the 
parents and relatives in the homes, they expected to produce good, substantial effects. 
As regards educational societies, educational exhibitions, etc., subjects relating to 
school hygiene and materials of hygiene were gradually increasing. Especially 
close attention was paid to trachoma and other contagious diseases, and if a case broke 
out no time was lost for its prevention and disinfection, so that the disease might

not spread. It is a circumstance for great congratulation that honor has been con- 
ferred on meritorious physicians. 
The number of public schools in which school physicians are engaged included | 
12,957 elementary schools, 80 normal schools, 242 middle schools, 144 high schools for 
girls, 3 special schools, 494 technical schools, 31 miscellaneous schools, and 2 blind 
and dumb schools, the total being 13,953. Compared with the previous year, this 
shows an increase of 1,199 elementary schools, 2 normal schools, 1 middle school, 12 
high schools for girls, 1 special school, 72 technical schools, and 6 miscellaneous 
schools, the total increase being 1,293. 
The elementary schools and supplementary technical schools, in some localities, 
were ill provided with good physicians, and in some places one physician had a 
number of schools under his charge. The only schools which had no physicians of . 
their own were chiefly village elementary schools, or town elementary schools of 
some towns whose inhabitants are less than 5,000, and all of them were under some 
special conditions which did not allow them to engage physicians. This is allowable, 
because the ordinance relating to school physicians stated that the local government 
may permit elementary-school authorities to postpone the employment of physicians 
if circumstances do not enable them to do so. 
The percentage of elementary schools which engaged their own school physicians 
was 61. Compared with the previous year there was an increase of 7, and compared 
with five years ago the increase was 20. The rate has thus gone on increasing, but 
even now the proportion goes only a little ahead of three-fifths, which means that more 
attention on this point is requisite.   
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION, 
In the establishment and organization of schools of the different 
elementary grades, two purposes are emphasized, namely, that of 
proportioning the number of institutions to the actual needs of 
localities, and that of adjusting them to the wants of different 
classes of students. 
In his report for 1910-11,1 the minister of education says, with 
reference to secondary education: 
Its advancement and development were undertaken in proper ratio to the develop- 
ment and propagation of elementary education. The stress was put on the inner 
improvements of education, and care was given to discipline, no less than to instruc- 
tion, so that healthy thought and sincere character might be fostered. On one hand, 
careful selection of good, efficient directors and teachers was made, while, on the 
other, nonqualified teachers were gradually decreased in number.   
  . 
With respect to special schools the minister continues: 
The number of special schools newly established every year is very small compared 
with that of other kinds of schools, because the very nature of a special school makes 
| it unnecessary for every prefecture to have one or more schools of this kind. But 
those already established, realizing the rapid advancement of the time, were more 
and more trying to catch up with it by turning out good fruit of their investigation 
in art and science and of the development thereof. They also paid attention to the 
completion of equipment and stability of their foundations, no less than to the im- 
provement of the teaching staff and its work, as well as to the increase of the pupils 
and to the formation in them of sincere character, so as to produce graduates who can 
meet the future demand of the nation.

  MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA. 865 
The secondary and special schools are maintained by local appro- 
priations, students’ fees, and subscriptions. They are regulated as 
to studies and equipment by official orders, and they are all subject 
to Government inspection, scholastic and medical. 
In view of an apparent deterioration in the health and physique 
of students, an investigation was ordered by the minister during the 
current year for the purpose of determining the effect of the dis- 
cipline and the studies of the secondary and special schools, and the- 
means to be adopted for promoting health and physical development 
of students both in the young men and young women. 
STUDENTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
One of the most noticeable facts in the record of higher education 
is the selection of students who are sent abroad to complete their 
studies under the direct control of the education department. During 
1912 the number of such students was 34, who were assigned to 
England, Germany, France, and the United States. In several in- 
stances the student was expected to study in the universities of 
several countries before his return to Japan. 
EXPENDITURE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
The following table shows the expenditure for public schools 
established by the authorities of Provinces and cantons (guns),

SIAM. 
The administration of public affairs in Siam is organized after 
European models, and the King’s cabinet includes a minister of public 
instruction and ecclesiastical affairs who has charge of schools for 
general education. Technical schools are committed to ministries 
relating to their specialties. Thus the ministry of lands and agricul- 
ture maintains an agricultural college. Elementary training in rural 
industries is fostered by the work of the settlement commission, 
created in 1901 to decide on the ownership of lands, a work which 
has. brought about the allotment and settlement of the richest agri- 
cultural lands of the Kingdom. Other forms of technical education 
are provided for by the local schools and by a system of scholarships 
which are awarded to young men of great promise who pursue their 
studies in foreign schools of mining, engineering, etc., in preparation 
for directive service in their own country. 
The success of the royal Government in the endeavor to promote 
elementary education is largely due to the support of the Buddhist 
priests, who are trained for teaching in a Government normal school, 
and are thus prepared to impart the elements of secular knowledge in 
the monastery schools which are utilized for that purpose. 
According to statistics for 1911-12, there were at the capital, 
Bangkok, the following Government schools: 138 primary schools, 
with 10,100 pupils; 4 higher primary schools, with 420 pupils; 2 
secondary schools, with 184 pupils, and 6 English schools, with 549 
pupils. The nucleus of a university existed in a medical college, 
with over 100 students, a training college for teachers, and a civil 
service college, and plans had been formed for organizing a complete 
university comprising faculties of law, medicine, engineering, agri- 
culture, commerce, and pedagogy. 
  
MODERN EDUCATION IN CHINA. 
The origin and development of the movement for modern educa- 
tion in China are very fully set forth in a bulletin of this office which 
brings the account through the year 1910.1 It is not the purpose 
here to review this history, but certain particulars respecting the 
organization of the system of modern education in accordance with 
Government decrees is necessary to a clear understanding of additional 
information derived from official sources. 
The military necessities of the Empire and the remarkable activity 
of missionary societies in China prepared the way for the general 
movement, which derived its impetus from the decree of September 
5, 1905. This decree abolished the system of examinations which

for ages had determined the access to all official careers in China. 
Provision for western learning became a matter of public effort in all 
the chief centers of China. By a decree of December 6, 1905, a 
ministry of education was instituted and formal organization given 
to the new system. This organization followed in important particu- 
lars the model furnished by the system of Japan. The main features 
of the system are the concentration of authority in the minister or 
president; the constitution of separate departments in the ministry 
to deal with different interests of the system; the provision of Gov- 
ernment inspectors charged to report on the condition of schools in 
all the Provinces; the constitution of provincial boards of education, 
the members of which are appointed by the ministry, and the appoint- 
ment in each Province of a commissioner of education, who reports 
directly to the central authority. 
The classes of schools authorized in the new system were primary 
(including kindergarten), normal schools, middle schools, and col- 
leges. The establishment of an Imperial University at Pekin was 
decreed, and authority was also given to the Provinces to establish 
universities within their respective areas. 
The Republic of China was declared in February, 1912, and educa- 
tion was one of the most prominent subjects that engaged the atten- 
tion of the provisional Government then formed; the modern system 
as organized by imperial decree was adopted, and is still maintained 
with only slight modifications of its main features. 
For the understanding of present conditions, it is necessary to 
keep in mind the vast extent of the country, which covers an area 
of more than 1,500,000 square miles, with population variously esti- 
mated from 270,000,000 to 312,000,000. For local government the 
Republic is organized into 18 Provinces, besides those in Manchuria 
and other dependencies. 
A report received from T. D. Cheshire, Esq., American consul 
general at Canton, contains a translation of a series of decrees which 
were issued by the minister of education in the fall of 1912, and 
which provide minute regulations for the conduct of all classes of 
schools included in the system. The extent of these orders pre- 
cludes their repetition here. It is, however, of special interest to 
note the directions pertaining to technical schools, since these relate 
more particularly than any other class of institutions to the develop- 
ment of China as a modern nation. The order relating to these 
schools is as follows: 
OrpER or THE Ministry or Epucation Retatine To TecunicaL ScHoots. 
ArticLe 1. The object of the technical schools shall be to confer a high grade of 
technical knowledge and to develop expert talent. 
Art. 2. The different kinds of technical schools shail be: Law schools, medical

Sixteenth Order of the Ministry of Education. 
Subsequent orders give minute regulations respecting each one of 
the classes of technical schools named in the second article. 
Peculiar interest attaches also to the order providing for the unifi- 
cation of the spoken language as here cited: 
OrpER oF THE Ministry or Epucation RELATING TO THE UNIFICATION OF THE 
Spoken LANGUAGE. 
ArtictE 1. In obedience to the seventh clause of article 8 of the executive order 
relating to the duties of officials, the minister of education will call an assembly for the 
special purpose of discussing ways and means of making uniform the spoken language. 
Art. 2, The assembly will meet under the auspices of the minister of education. 
The opening date will be February 15, 1913. 
Arr. 3. The assembly will be composed of the following members: 
1. Members invited by the minister of education, whose number will not be fixed. 
2. Geographical representatives as follows: Two from each Province to be appointed 
by the minister of education; one each from Mongolia and Tibet to be appointed by

EDUCATION IN THE PROVINCE OF KWANGTUN 
  The translation of these orders is accompanied by the following 
statement pertaining to the Province of Kwangtung: 
Regarding the manner in which the new regulations are being enforced in the Prov- 
ince of Kwangtung, an interview was held with Mr. Chung Jung-kuang, the provincial 
commissioner of education. This gentleman has for many years occupied the position 
of dean of the Canton Christian College, one of the leading educational institutions of 
this Province, and is therefore well qualified for his present responsible post. He 
stated that the educational affairs of the Province had not since the revolution been 
completely reorganized. Many of the local primary schools, as well as private schools, 
had not yet been brought under the governmental scheme, but a thorough inspection 
of all the schools was soon to be made and it was hoped that matters would soon become 
more systematized. 
So far each district, of which there are 94, is required to maintain one model lower 
primary and one model higher primary school. More may be founded later, but this 
has been made the necessary minimum, 
In apportioning middle schools the Province has been divided into 14 divisions, 
and one middle school assigned to each. 
Next above the middle schools come the universities, of which, under the new 
system, one each is to be established at Peking, Wuchow, Nanking, and Canton. No 
university, however, has ever existed at Canton, nor does it seem probable that one 
will be founded for three years to come at least. Such a thing is doubtless financially 
out of the question at this time, and, furthermore, the need for a university is possibly 
less here than in any other part of the country, because of the proportionately large 
number of students from Kwangtung who obtain their university training abroad. 
Though not equipped with a university, the Province boasts of a higher normal 
school, whose fine buildings were erected a few years ago on the site of the old Canton 
examination hall. There is also a law school, an agricultural school of medium 
standard, and a commercial school of higher grade. Certain Government schools, 
notably the Industrial School and the School of Languages, which were in operation 
before the revolution, have not yet been reopened. In addition, there are many 
private schools founded both by Chinese subjects and by foreign missionary societies, 
of which it is hoped that many may be incorporated under the governmental system. 
For example, in Canton there are three medical schools, a school of pharmacy, a 
sectarian middle school (the Canton Christian College), as well as institutions carried 
on by American missionary societies. Mr. Chung stated that be hoped by the end 
of the summer to have a large number of. private institutions, as well as the schools 
organized by local communities, brought under the control of the Government.

    870 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The Canton Christian College, mentioned in the above statement, 
is an undenominational institution under the general management of 
trustees, incorporated in the State of New York. It is supported 
by voluntary subscriptions, which for the 10 years of the existence 
of the college have-amounted to $155,916. Of this amount about 
$23,000 was contributed by the Chinese, to be applied to the erection 
of dormitories on the college grounds. In their report for 1911 the 
trustees of the college urged the importance of appropriations 
amounting to at least $100,000 for the immediate uses of the insti- 
tution. 
EDUCATION IN AMOY.' 
Education in Amoy, a treaty port in the Province of Fukien, may fairly be divided 
into four well-defined groups: (1) The Government schools, new style; (2) the old- 
style Chinese schools; (3) mission educational enterprises; and (4) two secular schools 
under foreign management, one for boys and one for girls, supported by Chinese. 
1. Government schools.—The Government schools in this city, five in number, are 
allopen for boysonly. So far there are no Government schools for girls. The Govern- 
ment middle school, the most important of those mentioned, has a course of study 
conforming to that prescribed for all Government schools of its class. It includes 
Chinese history, Chinese literature (classics), Chinese geography, morals, mathematics 
(arithmetic and algebra), English, and physical culture (including military drill), 
elements of physics, chemistry and geology, Chinese penmanship, and Chinese com- 
position. It is difficult to determine just how much of this work is brought to a high 
standard, but from evidence given by the ‘“‘graduates” of this school it must be 
admitted that few of its students obtain a thorough grounding in elemental principles 
of the subjects offered. Generally speaking, it may be said that the standard of 
instruction is low. 
It is difficult to have pupils stay in the schools sufficiently long to reach the higher 
grades, Itisstill more difficult to have many remain in school if the standard of exami- 
nationsis placed high. It would be safe to say that the majority of pupils matriculated 
drop out of schools before having acquired any large degree of proficiency, and the 
pupil who stays to complete his course in a thorough manner is a rare exception. 
The Amoy Government middle school derives its support from the old fund used 
for the maintenance of the old examination halls. This fund comes from interest on 
old subscriptions, some lands, the rental of which is used for the schools and the rental 
from houses owned by the school. The gentry also give money for its support which 
is managed by a board of trustees elected from the gentry. While it is not possible to 
say definitely that no money comes to Amoy from the amount allotted to education 
in the Province, yet, it is confidently asserted by persons in Amoy, that of the entire 
$400,000 allotted to the Government schools for the Province of Fukien, none reaches 
this city. This is stated to be the cause for its backwardness in educational develop- 
ment. 
In Foochow, it is stated, $400,000 local currency ($200,000 gold) a year is allotted 
to the commissioner of education for the maintenance of the schools. This amount 
is derived from various forms of taxation, but just what taxes are collected for educa- 
tion it is impossible to say. It is known, however, that they include certain court 
fines. 
In Amoy a tax was levied on the exportation of narcissus bulbs, part of which was 
to be devoted to schools, while a portion of the taxes on the lottery monopoly was also 
to be used for the maintenance of the public schools. The attempt to collect this tax       
From statement furnished by Mr. Charles F. Brissel, vice consul in charge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-925
  
MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA. 871 
met with opposition, for it was asserted that the money would not be used for educa- 
tion, hence it was merely a means of increasing taxation without producing a benefit 
for those taxed. The remaining four of the Government schools mentioned above 
are supposed to derive their support from these taxes, but in many cases the main 
function of the principal of the schools is to obtain the necessary financial support 
either from public donations or from his wealthy friends whom he may be able to 
interest. Before the institution of the new-style school, the president of a school 
was always required to be a scholar of more than ordinary ability, and in many cases 
he was wealthy and with his own personal wealth met the expenses of the school, but 
if he were not wealthy, its support was usually provided by a board of trustees. 
The Amoy Government middle school has large, well-kept premises, being those 
formerly devoted to the halls for the old-style examinations. The buildings are 
located just within the north gate; that is, inside the old city wall of the original city 
of Amoy. The school has 180 pupils, ranging in ages from 8 to 20. There are 36 
recitation hours a week. The school hours are from 9 until 12 and from 2 until 5. 
The teaching staff is composed of a superintendent called a Chu-jen, a second degree 
man, said in the old style to correspond to the M. A. degree; 5 Sui-Chai, first degree 
men, old style said to correspond to the B. A.; 1 graduate from the Foochow Normal 
School and 1 graduate from the Tung Wen Institute in Amoy. 
The buildings and groundsare very favorably situated, but are much unlike western 
school premises. No one building is large; all are one-story and are so arranged about 
a quadrangle as to form what might be called,a small park. In these buildings there 
are some modern chairs and aids in teaching, but the equipment is very meager and 
not of great value. It is estimated to be worth $250 gold. The annual expenses are 
about $4,500 gold. 
A school of much the same type is the Amoy Public Middle School. This school has 
two divisions, the elementary and the advanced. While these are called “public 
schools,’ it must be remembered that tuition in them costs about $12 gold a year 
(the same charges 1n practically all the schools, more than mission schools, but the 
same as the Tung Wen Institute), and the scholars must buy their own books and 
supplies. There is no such thing as a real public school conducted on the lines of the 
public schools of New York City. The Amoy Public Middle School is located in the 
section of Amoy city called Wei Ching and has about 200 students. It has 12 instruc- 
tors, 2 from the Tung Wen Institute and most of the remainder from the Foochow 
Normal School. The three remaining schools of the Government class are extremely 
elementary. 
2. Old-style Chinese schools.—The old-style Chinese schools at Amoy are practically 
the same as in other parts of China. The teachers are usually very poorly paid, the 
instruction is given in a very unwestern way, the pupils study out loud and attend 
as little as possible. There are not more than 30 in one school, and at times only 3 or 
4 are in attendance. There is usually but one instructor. These schools are poorly 
housed and make no pretense at giving modern instruction. 
3. Mission educational enterprises —All of the missions (American—Reformed 
Church in America; British—The London Mission Society; the English Presbyterian) 
maintain educational enterprises in the various portions of this district. ‘The courses 
in these schools are not very advanced, and some of the schools-are not graded. It 
must be remembered that in most of the cities and towns where the mission schools 
exist there are no native schools excepting the old-style schools. 
In some of these mission schools there are kindergartens. One of these kinder- 
gartens has about 100 children whose ages range from 4 to 10. They all pay, and 
their fees are sufficient to meet the running expenses of the school, which has been 
self-supporting for 10 years. The pupils come from all classes, but usually not from 
the more wealthy. They learn to read and write in the romanized Chinese of this 
district and in Chinese character, as well as study arithmetic, drawing, object and
-P-A-G-E-926
  
  872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
nature study. The teachers are all girls who have had a good education in the mission 
girls’ schools and who give their services for the nominal salary of $1 gold a month to 
enable them to be trained as kindergarten teachers. Ten such girls, so trained, are 
now out teaching kindergartens, some getting very good salaries, being paid by native 
churches. 
In Amoy the English Presbyterian Mission and the American Mission maintain 
large schools for girls, while the three missions unite in maintaining the Union Middle 
School for boys. This middle school was established in 1881, and now has 64 boys. 
The school comprises an advanced grade, but owing to the difficulties of language 
(the boys are taught English as a subject and not taught in English), modern English 
textbooks are not used. The annual cost of maintenance is about $1,500 in gold, 
not including the salary of the foreigner who directs the school. 
Among other missionary schools should be mentioned the Anglo- 
Chinese College at Amoy, a British institution for boys who are 
supposed to have completed the course in the Union Middle School 
and two schools of the American Mission, which receive both boys 
and girls and include in their course of instruction manual training 
for boys and household industries for girls. Scattered throughout 
the district the missions have many schools attached to their churches 
and chapels; it is noticeable that the Chinese Christians contribute 
to the support of these mission institutions. 
4. Secular schools under foreign management.—The fourth class of schools includes 
the Amoy Girls’ High School and the Tung Wen Institute. The school for girls is 
maintained by the Chinese and is attended by those girls who are willing to pay more 
than is required at the mission schools. The tuition is $15 a year, in addition to 
which the pupils must provide their own books and supplies. There are about 40 
girls in attendance, the larger proportion being day pupils. The name ‘high school” 
does not accurately define the status of the school. It teaches practically all grades, 
and on occasion will teach French and German. 
The Tung Wen Institute is an efficient and progressive school. Its former students 
and graduates are found in a large number of the better-paid positions of the city, 
conspicuously in the customhouse, the post office, and the consulates, where they act 
as translators and interpreters. The school was established in 1899 by the Chinese, 
with the assistance of the then American consul, Mr. A. Burlingame Johnson. Since 
its establishment a fine building, costing $15,000 gold (a large sum for this part of 
China), has been erected. The building and grounds at the present time are con- 
servatively estimated to be worth $25,000 gold. Through the efforts of Mr. Julean H. 
Arnold, recently consul at Amoy, an endowment fund of $25,000 gold was raised by 
the Chinese, the trustees, and friends of the institute. This is one of the few, if not 
the only, educational institution in China conducted on these lines, and it is a con- 
spicuous success. 
The attendance during last year was 268. There are two foreign instructors (the 
superintendent and the assistant superintendent) and seven Chinese instructors 
who teach in English. There is one Chinese teacher of Mandarin and two Chinese 
teachers of the local dialect. This school teaches no religion and has among its stu- 
dents Christians, both Protestants and Catholics, and boys from families adhering to 
Chinese religions. The chief function of the school is to prepare for business and 
teaching, and, as previously noted, many of its former students and graduates are 
employed in public offices and there are many in the local business offices. In the 
city schools, as they were conducted prior to the revolution, many of the teachers 
were students of Tung Wen. This school at the present time is progressing splendidly 
and is a credit to the superintendent, Mr. C. J. Weed, who has conducted it since its
-P-A-G-E-927
  MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA. 873 
establishment. Associated with Mr. Weed, who is an American, are a number of 
Chinese gentlemen, and it is largely due to their liberal support, both with their per- 
sonal influence and their annual gratuities, as well as their contributions to the endow- 
ment fund, that this achievement has been made possible. 
A GOVERNMENT COLLEGE. 
Special interest attaches to the Tsing Hua College, which is an 
outcome of the Indemnity Fund returned to the Chinese Government 
by the United States, amounting to $10,785,286. In consequence of 
the action of Congress to this effect the Government of China decided 
to send yearly a considerable number of students to the United States 
for their education, and as a means of preparing students to profit by 
the opportunity for advanced study in America thus offered, the 
Tsing Hua Collegé was organized and began its work in the spring of 
1912. The college is under an administrative board, of which the 
president is Mr. Tsur Yetsung, an A. B. of Yale University and M. A, 
of the University of Wisconsin. The college is organized in two 
departments, namely the Chinese department and the Western 
department. The president of the board of administration is dean 
of both departments. The professors in the Chinese department are 
all natives of China. The professors of the Western departments are, 
with few exceptions, Americans, and all are graduates of leading 
institutions of this country. There are also assistant instructors, 
who are graduates either of Pekin University or of mission institutions 
of high grade in China. 
AN INTERNATIONAL ENTERPRISE, 
The International Institute of China was established at Shanghai 
about 20 years ago for the purpose of promoting the general welfare 
of the country, moral, material, and political; and under the new 
conditions the purposes of the institute assume new importance. 
The work of the institute is carried on under four sections: Com- 
mercial, educational, religious, and the-woman’s section. The funds 
for its support are derived from private sources. The director in 
chief is Dr. Gilbert Reid, who is assisted by an executive committee, 
comprising both native and foreign members of distinction. The 
institute has been successful in exciting interest and support among 
the higher classes in China. 
INDIA. 
THE NEW GOVERNMENT POLICY. 
The new Government policy with respect to education in India, 
announced on the occasion of the Delhi ‘‘durbar,’’ December 12, 
1911, has been defined by the issue of a resolution which appeared in 
the Gazette of India, February 22, 1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-928
  874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
In its preliminary statement this document comprises a review of 
education since the date of Lord Curzon’s well-known resolution of 
1904, and while noting the great advance made and the improve- 
ments effected in all departments of educational activity it draws 
attention to the serious problems that yet remain to be solved. The 
most pressing of these problems is declared to be the formation of 
character. The Government, therefore, while maintaining an atti- 
tude of strict religious neutrality, expresses deep interest in the 
experiments in moral education that are now going on in various 
parts of the country. Closely allied to these efforts is the creation of 
circumstances that tend to moral purity, and in this respect the 
Government has assumed direct responsibility by arrangements for 
the supply of residential accommodations, ‘‘hostels,” for pupils in 
high schools and colleges, thereby making sure that the young student 
residents shall be under the influence of persons of character 
entrusted with the care of their health and moral well-being. 
In elaborating the principles of primary education the Government 
of India has made it clear that a system of free compulsory education 
is contemplated, but for financial and administrative reasons this 
purpose can not be immediately realized. The resolution, however, 
calls for the widest possible extension of primary education and urges 
_ “local governments to make provision for free elementary education 
amongst the poorer and backward classes of the population.” The 
education of girls, which has rapidly advanced during the last decade, 
is declared to be a matter demanding continued effort with careful 
adjustments to existing social conditions. 
Discussing the means by which the extension of primary education 
is to be accomplished, a contemporary journal says: 
Indigenous schools of the old type are also to share in the patronage of the Govern- 
ment. An attempt is to be made to regulate the courses of instruction in rural and 
urban areas to suit the special requirements of village and town life. Better facilities 
for the training of teachers and for a periodical refreshment of their educational experi- 
ences are other noteworthy features of the scheme. ‘The low financial status occupied 
by teachers of elementary schools in the country has long been a disgrace to every body 
concerned with them. But thanks to the generous and practical sympathy of the 
present Viceroy, there is to be an appreciable improvement. The gladdening decla- 
ration has gone forth: ‘‘Trained teachers should receive not less than 12 rupees per 
month, special rates being given in certain areas. They should be placed in a graded 
service, and they should either be eligible for a pension or admitted to a provident fund.” 
‘The message will cheer many an unfortunate soul toiling for the very necessities of life, 
even when rendering to the community the valuable service of educating its young 
minds. Vernacular schools are also to be pressed into service to subserve the work of 
expansion, and there is to be an extension of the benefits of education on a very large 
scale. It may not be difficult to realize the hope: ‘‘It is the desire and hope of the 
Government of India to see in the not distant future some 91,000 primary public 
schools added to the 100,000 which already exist for boys and to double the 4,500,000 
pupils who now receive instruction in them,”? The larger use of the services of women
-P-A-G-E-929
MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA, 875 
  teachers and the securing of continuity in control and inspection are other reforms that 
have been suggested. 
The importance of secondary education, which is the basis of all 
professional and industrial education in India, is fully recognized in 
the resolution. At the same time it is announced that so far as pos- 
sible this will be left, as heretofore, to private enterprise. The action 
of the Government in this field will be directed to improving the 
quality of the instruction and the raising of standards. For this pur- 
pose it is proposed: 
(1) To employ in the few existing Government schools only graduates or trained 
teachers; introduce a graded service for their teachers, with a minimum salary of 40 
rupees ($13) a month, or a maximum salary of 400 rupees ($130) a month; to provide 
proper hostel accommodations; and to introduce aschool course complete in itself, with. 
a staff sufficient for teaching the “‘modern side’’; introduce manual training and im- 
prove science teaching. 
(2) To increase the grant-in-aid for private institutions in order that they may keep 
pace with the improvements in the Government schools in the directions above indi- 
cated, and encourage the establishment of new aided institutions where necessary. 
(3) Multiply and improve training colleges, so that the supply of qualified teachers 
for secondary schools may be fully equal to the demand. 
(4) Found new Government schools in localities in which this action is eminently 
desirable. 
The importance of technical and professional institutions of all kinds 
is emphasized in the resolution, and the purpose declared of remodel- 
ing them so as to bring them closer to Indian needs and conditions, 
In particular, it is promised that an effort will be made “to bridge 
over the gulf between the artistic traditions of the nation and the 
exotic elements that have been introduced into the art schools.” 
The first step in this reform will be that of preserving for and in 
India, “scientifically arranged collections of the products of its ancient 
and modern arts and crafts.” Specific recommendations respecting 
both technical and university education are deferred until Govern- 
ment inquiries now in progress are completed, but assurance is given 
that in both fields future advance will be directed with constant regard 
to the wants of India. Encouragement for oriental studies and the 
institution of an oriental college at Delhi are promised, the special 
colleges for chiefs are to be improved, and in view of the awakened 
interest of the Mohammedan communities in modern education lib- 
eral provision is to be made for them under conditions adjusted to 
their requirements. 
The spirit which animates the resolution is shown by the closing 
appeal to the Indian public here cited: 
The Governor General in Council trusts that the growing section of the Indian 
public which is interested in education will join in establishing under the guidance 
and with the help of Government those quickening systems of education on which 
the best minds in India are now converging and on which the prospects of the rising 
generation depend. He appeals with confidence to wealthy citizens throughout India  
-P-A-G-E-930
  876 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
to give of their abundance to the cause of education; in the foundation of scholarships, 
the building of hostels, schools, colleges, laboratories, gymnasia, swimming baths, 
the provision of playgrounds and other structural improvements, in furthering the 
cause of modern scientific studies and especially of technical education, in gifts of 
prizes and equipment, the endowment of chairs and fellowships, and the provision for 
research of every kind. There is a wide field and a noble opportunity for the exercise 
on modern lines of that charity and benevolence for which India has been renowned 
from ancient times. 
It is not expected that the large plans set forth in the resolution 
will be realized in a brief time, but already the announcement, sup- 
ported as it is by the increased grants from the public treasury 
amounting to 50 lakhs of rupees ($1,620,000) for popular education 
and an extra grant of 10 lakhs ($324,000) for higher education, has 
stimulated the provincial governments to renewed efforts. All 
authorities and observers are agreed as to this activity, the results of 
which are not yet measurable. The features of the year’s record are 
summed up by the joint secretary to the Government of India, as 
follows: 
The collection of materials for the preparation of extensive schemes for the spread 
of elementary education, and, in certain Provinces, for the improvement of secondary 
education; the growth of new ideas regarding university teaching, which has resulted 
in the proposal for a teaching and residential university at Dacca; the generous gift 
of Sir T. N. Palit to the University of Calcutta; the creation of a department of indus- 
tries at Madras as a portion of the scheme of industrial training and development; the 
sanctioning of an industrial scheme for the central Provinces; an inquiry carried out 
by Col. Atkinson and Mr. Dawson into the question of bringing technical institutions 
into cleser touch with the employers of labor; the institution of proposals for an Oriental 
Research Institute; and the conference held in July, 1912, on the education of the 
domiciled community, whose interests have not been overlooked in the distribution 
of imperial grants.! 
CHANGING ATTITUDE OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. 
One of the chief problems confronting the educational authorities 
in India arises from the attitude of the Mohammedans. Every com- 
mission has urged as a matter of great consequence efforts to secure 
the confidence of this people and to foster their interest in modern 
education. A change in the attitude of the leading Moslems was 
‘noticeable in the closing years of the nineteenth century and is 
attributed largely to the influence of the late Sir Syed Ahmad Khan. 
At first this influence was confined to the upper and middle classes, 
but it has gradually filtered down to the masses. This explains the 
fact that in the last nine years the number of Moslem pupils attending 
modern schools has increased by about 50 per cent and represents 
over 16.7 per cent of the children of that community of school-going 
age, a proportion slightly in excess of the average for the children of 
  
1 Bombay Government Gazette, Apr. 10, 1913.

  MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA, 877 
all the races and grades. In higher education, however, the number 
of Moslems under instruction is below the general average. 
For the purpose of promoting this movement the Government of 
India has issued a ciccular letter to the local governments on the 
subject. 
REVIVALS IN LITERATURE AND ART. 
One of the most interesting outcomes of British administration in 
India is the revival of literary interests in Bengal. Reference is not 
here made to the journalistic output, but to a true literary activity. 
A well-known authority on development in India says of this revival: 
The word ‘‘renaissance,’’ which I have already used, most nearly describes the 
period through which Bengal has been passing during the last century. There has 
come to pass under British rule a true rebirth of an ancient culture and civilization. 
The course taken has been more complex than that experienced by Europe in the 
sixteenth century—it has been a double instead of a single process—but the result- 
anthas been thesame. The Greek and Latin culture, which lay behind the European 
movement, was itself an indigenous European product. The Indian renaissance, on 
the other hand, was ushered in at first by a wholly foreign culture—the western learn- 
ing. But fortunately, or, as I should prefer to call it, providentially, this was but 
the beginning of the process, not the end. The second and far greater stage—the 
Indian renaissance stage proper—was reached when, owing to the impact of a foreign 
culture, the classical literature of India itself, and the ideals of civilization which it 
contained, began to be revalued and recovered. This was the true renaissance 
movement, corresponding most closely with that of Europe. ‘It is the working out 
of this greater impulse which we are witnessing on all sides to-day.! 
The development has been emphasized by the recent bestowal of 
the Nobel prize upon Tagore, whose poems seem to have inspired 
the article cited. 
Closely related to this literary renaissance is the interest in the 
revival of Indian art and craftsmanship, which was strongly advo- 
cated by Lord Curzon while Governor General of India, and has been 
urged by many Englishmen familiar with life and customs in that 
Empire. Conspicuous among these is Maj. J. B. Keith, formerly of 
the Indian Archaeological Survey, who has contributed important 
studies of Indian art and architecture to the Dawn, the organ of a 
society for promoting native interests. The London Morning Post 
finds the text for a recent article on the subject in a significant 
sentence quoted from another authority on the Indian situation. 
The passage which opens up the economic bearings of the subject is 
as follows: 
Every new outlet for artistic employment opened, or old one made wider, is a 
guaranty for law and order. Every good handicraftsman forced into menial labor 
or quill-driving is not only a loss to Indian revenues, but a direct contribution to the 
elements of sedition and discontent.

  878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The London Post, in indorsing this sentiment, says: 
Labor is the law of life, and never till the crack of doom will a nation’s life be 
other than happy so long as its labor is of the kind which exercises the lower rather 
than the higher instincts in men’s character.!

AFRICA. 
THE FRENCH COLONIES. 
The French Government was the first to enter seriously upon the 
work of establishing modern schools in northern Africa, and the 
experience gained in Algeria has determined the educational policy 
in the other French possessions. To insure stable government, great 
attention is paid to the details of administration, native regiments 
are formed and drilled under French officers; and native police 
assigned to service under close inspection. Thus, a secure basis is 
prepared for schools and teachers, that from time to time are pro- 
vided for districts outside the settled towns. In the latter the 
schools for the French residents and other Europeans are organized 
in the same way as the public schools of France, but for the natives 
all orders of missionary schools are encouraged, and from the first 
the policy was adopted of recognizing the native schools and en-

deavoring gradually to introduce into them modern subjects and a 
new order of teachers. 
Algeria forms an academy in the French university, and so far as 
Government schools are concerned is thoroughly assimilated to the 
French system of education. There is a university at Algiers, com- 
prising faculties of law, medicine and pharmacy, science, and letters. 
In 1912 the professors numbered 102 and the students 1,331. For 
secondary education there were 3 lycées and 7 colleges for boys with 
an enrollment of 4,774 students, and 3 lycées and 1 college for girls 
with 1,383 students. 
The modern primary schools were attended by 141,537 pupils in 
1911; there were also 226 Mohammedan schools for elementary 
instruction. Native teachers are trained in modern subjects in the 
normal schools, which are attended also by French candidates. There 
are altogether four normal schools for men teachers in the colony, 
and six normal schools for women teachers. The Government ex- 
pends for public instruction in the colony nearly nine million francs 
annually. 
In the regency of Tunis the French have been peculiarly successful 
in bringing Mohammedans into the modern schools; about one-fourth 
of all the boys who attend the French schools belong to this part of 
the population. 
In the island of Madagascar, which has been a French colony since 
1896, a system of education compulsory for children from 8 to 14 is 
established and has been effectively carried out among the Hora and _ 
other tribes of the central districts who are Christianized. The schools 
for the European population, who number about 12,000 in a total of 
8,000,000, are conducted in the same way as the schools of France. 
For the natives there are above 550 Government schools, with 875 
teachers and 54,000 pupils. The Government expends annually 
nearly $200,000 for education. Mission schools are encouraged, but 
not aided, by the Government; they are required to follow the offi- 
cial programs, and all children must learn the French language. 
There is every inducement for so doing, from the fact that natives 
are largely employed in subordinate positions in the civil and military 
service. 
In their eastern colonies on the continent the French have estab- 
lished many schools, which are exercising a decided influence over 
the male population; complaint is made that the endeavors to edu- 
cate the native girls have thus far, with few exceptions, been unsat- 
isfactory. 
In French colonies on the west coast less progress has been made 
in the establishment of schools, but the work has been stimulated 
since the appointment of an inspector general of education for all the 
areas on the west coast under French control. The headquarters of 
this official are at Dakar.

THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN POSSESSIONS. 
As a result of the war between Turkey and Italy, Tripoli has come 
under the sovereignty of the latter country, and the Italian Gov- 
ernment has taken active measures to bring its new possessions into 
the full current of modern life. Special attention has been given to 
the improvement of conditions in the city of Tripoli as regards 
administration and sanitation, and the development of public works. 
Schools have been established, and in all of these a service of medical 
inspection has been organized and efficiently carried out. 
The German Government, which controls possessions on both the 
west and east coasts of Africa, comprising altogether an area of 
931,460 square miles, with an estimated population of 4,500,000, has 
but recently adopted plans for the education of the natives in these 
regions. 
LIBERIA. 
A great impetus has been given to the cause of public education 
in the Liberian Republic by the recent action of the American 
Colonization Society. In October, 1912, the society paid over 
to Ernest Lyon, consul general of Liberia in the United States, the 
sum of $60,000, being the increment of the fund in trust to be applied 
to the education of the colored children of Liberia in public schools. 
The society was organized in 1817 for the administration of an 
-estate donated by Caroline Donovan, of Baltimore, the proceeds 
in rentals to be used in sending negro immigrants from America to 
Liberia and settling them in their new homes, with a reversion of 
the revenues for the education of Liberian children in public schools 
in case the primary purpose should not exhaust the fund. The 
decline of emigration has left the fund dormant for some time, and 
consequently the necessary measures have been taken to carry 
out the second purpose specified by the donor. The fund goes into 
the public treasury of the Republic and will be administered through 
the national legislature, which must pass upon all expenditures of 
the same. The trust provides a normal revenue of from $3,000 to 
$4,000 a year. 
The continuing income of the original fund will be used for the 
primary purposes of the society so far as required, and the balance 
annually turned over to the Government of Liberia. 
Primary education is supplied by Government schools, which 
number 113, and mission schools, of which there are about 90; it has 
been announced that the new fund will be used to maintain a school 
on the model of Hampton and Tuskegee.

EGYPT. 
Three decades have elapsed since the Khedive signed the decree 
of January 18, 1883, which abolished the joint control of England 
and France over affairs in Egypt. At that time an English adviser 
was appointed whose concurrence is required to give validity to. 
financial decisions. This official has a seat in the council of min- 
isters, but has no executive duties; nevertheless his influence is not 
limited to his own special province. 
During the period of joint control the French were most active in 
establishing schools chiefly at Cairo, Alexandria, and a few other 
of the provincial towns. The French schools aro still flourishing, 
but since English influence has been supreme a well-planned system of 
education has been adopted and is contributing greatly to the trans- 
formation which is taking place in governmental activities and social 
life. 
Control of public schools is centralized in the minister of public 
instruction; Government aid to schools is distributed in proportion 
to the amount of local support and upon certain conditions relating 
to the teaching staff and material equipment and the standard 
which the school maintains. The regulations in these respects 
so far as they pertain to secondary and higher institutions are 
determined by standards of European countries, modified by the 
special conditions of Egypt. 
As regards the elementary education of the mass of the people, 
the Government pursues a plan of great practical utility. From time 
immemorial indigenous schools have existed. called “kuttabs,” 
which were similar to the elementary schools in other Mohammedan 
countries. In 1897 the minister of education endeavored to bring 
these schools under Government supervision by offering grants to 
those that would teach the three R’s, using the vernacular language, 
but following an official course, and would submit to inspection. 
The Government itself maintains a few ‘“kuttabs,’ which serve as 
models for this elementary work. The number of the Government 
schools increased from 55, with 2,934 pupils (boys 2,547, girls 377), 
in 1897, to 146 schools, with 15,169 pupils, in 1911. Of the latter 
total, 9,901 were boys and 5,268 were girls. 
The progress in the Government kuttabs is significant, but not 
more so than that of the private kuttabs—that is, private elementary 
vernacular schools that have been brought under Government 
inspection. In 1909-10 the reports showed that 3,582 schools of 
this class, with 190,875 pupils (174,023 boys, 16,852 girls), were under 
inspection. Of these schools, 3,054 received grants in aid amounting 
to $105,000. In 1911-12 the corresponding figures were 3,556 
schools; 210,445 pupils (191,687 boys, 18,758 girls); the number of 
17726°—xp 1913—vor 1——56
-P-A-G-E-936
    882 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
schools receiving Government grant was 3,279; amount of grant, 
$110,000. 
The ministry has recently created five normal schools for training 
men teachers and one for women teachers, all preparing to enter into 
‘this work; during the current year holiday classes for teachers in the 
service were conducted at 35 centers. 
The latest development in this department is the establishment by 
the Government of trade schools for carpentry, metal work, etc., at 
Bulak and Assiut. Private agencies have followed this example, so 
that trade schools in close relations with the kuttabs are now formed 
in all the chief centers of population. 
Statistics for modern schools and higher institutions, not including 
the kuttabs, show the following for 1911: Number of students in pro- 
fessional colleges, 1,231, including 28 women; in secondary schools, 
2,160 boys; in higher primary schools, 7,709 pupils, including 505 
girls; in technical and trade schools, 1,139 boys; in normal schools, 
schools for household industry, and nurse training schools, 157 girls. 
REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE IN EGYPT. 
The following information relative to the requirements for the 
practice of medicine in all its branches in Egypt has been communi- 
cated to the Department of State for the information of Americans 
who may desire to enter into professional practice in that country. 
Under date of August 30, 1913, the American vice consul general at 
Cairo wrote as follows: 
In accordance with a khedivial decree, no one is permitted to practice medicine in 
any of its branches, unless he be the holder of a diploma from a recognized college, and 
obtains a license to practice from the Egyptian Department of Public Health. This 
department holds itseli us the sole judge as to whether the college which has issued the 
diploma is “reconnue”’ (recognized) and that the diploma must carry with it the right 
to practice in the country from which it emanates. 
With regard to the American diploma, it is now provided that a State license to 
practice must accompany the diploma, and that if the department of public health 
has any suspicion of the genuineness of these documents, it will require the appli- 
cant to obtain their authentication under the seal of the Department of State. 
The department of public health has requested that these regulations be brought to 
the knowledge of American universities in order that their Egyptian students may be 
informed of the requirements. 
During my conversation with the acting director general, he stated that these regu- 
lations would, not be enforced against the American diploma until after the date of 
notification to the American colleges, and that the licenses to practice would be given 
to holders of diploma, from recognized medical colleges, issued prior to that date. 
For foreigners the authorization is given upon stamped paper to the 
value of 30 milliémes (about 15 cents). In the case of foreigners the 
authorization must be accompanied by a certifieate of good charac- 
ter and identification from his consular authorities.

MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA. 883 
SOUTH AFRICA. 
The Union of South Africa, constituted by an act of 1909, effective 
May 31, 1910, comprises the former self-governing colonies, namely, 
Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange River 
Colony. The seat of the Government is Pretoria, but the legislature 
assembles at Cape Town. The governor general of the united colo- 
nies is appointed by the British sovereign; a provincial council in 
each Province legislates on subjects specified in the organizing act 
and on such other matters as may be delegated to it. Public affairs 
are administered through executive departments, including a depart- 
ment of education, whose chief bears the title minister of education. 
The province of the minister at present is limited to the general con- 
trol of the University of the Cape of Good Hope, the colleges, and the 
South African school of mines and technology. It was provided in 
the act of 1909 that for a period of five years, and thereafter until 
Parliament provides otherwise, education other than the higher 
should remain under the jurisdiction of the respective provincial 
councils. 
e EDUCATION FOR THE EUROPEANS. 
In all the Provinces provision for the education of the European 
children is made by Government schools and Government-aided 
schools. The general control of these schools is committed to a 
provincial department, but local school authorities have great freedom 
in respect to the establishment, staffing, and conduct of the schools. 
In Cape Colony, education has been made compulsory for the children 
of Europeans in nine-tenths of the school districts, the upper age 
limit of compulsion being 14 years, and the grade limit the fourth. 
The obligation applies to all children living within the legal 3 miles 
distance from school. Districts are aided in providing necessary 
school buildings by Government loans, which run for long periods. 
The schools are supported by local fees and taxes, supplemented by 
Government grants. 
In the Transvaal the law provides for free and obligatory education, 
but no upper limit of age is fixed for compulsion. In this colony 
the Government grant provides the chief support for the schools. 
In the Province of Natal, also, education is free and compulsory. In 
the Province of the Orange Free State education is compulsory, but 
fees are charged with provision for remitting same in the case of very 
poor children. 
Provision for secondary education is made in the cities, as a rule, 
by public high schools or advanced classes connected with the ele- 
mentary schools, but there are many private schools of secondary 
character, generally denominational.   
 
-P-A-G-E-938
  884 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
The public schools for the children of Europeans and their descend- 
ants are well organized, carefully inspected, and efficient, and the 
ratio of school enrollment to the white population is high. Present 
efforts are therefore directed mainly to the improvement of the schools 
and the social and financial condition of the teachers. 
The following statistics show the extent to which the white popula- 
tion avails itself of the public primary schools:

PRESENT PROBLEMS. 
The establishment of schools for the European population and the 
means of enforcing school attendance having been provided for, the 
matters now engaging chief attention relate to the provision for indus- 
trial education according to the different requirements of cities and 
the farming regions. 
In the Transvaal, which from the time of its coming under British 
control has had the services of a general director of education, con- 
siderable progress has been made in the direction of industrial educa- 
tion. At the present time there are two trades schools in the Province, 
one at Johannesburg and the other at Pretoria. These schools are 
equipped for teaching blacksmithing, carpentry, wagon making, elec- 
trical and mechanical engineering, printing and book binding, etc. 
Manual training has also been introduced into the public primary 
and high schools and into the normal schools. 
Provision for agricultural training in the form of what are termed 
“farm schools” is under consideration in all the Provinces. The 
proposition is to have agricultural schools provided each with a 
fully equipped farm. Schools of this character are not to be con- 
founded with the existing provision of farm schools—that is, primary
-P-A-G-E-939
  
MODERN EDUCATION IN ASIA AND AFRICA, 885 
schools conducted either by itinerant teachers who go from farm to 
farm instructing children remote from villages and towns, or schools 
maintained upon one farm to which the children of adjoining farms 
are brought. Provision of this nature is made to some extent in all 
the Provinces. 
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED AND NATIVE CHILDREN. 
The non-European population comprises the mixed races, natives, 
and a small contingent of East Indians. Separate schools are main- 
tained for the three classes, and it has not been found so far practicable 
to make school attendance compulsory for these people. The extent 
to which they are reached by elementary schools is indicated by the

AUSTRALIA. 
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS. 
  The report of the Commissioner of Education for 1912 presented an 
epitome of the systems of education in the six States comprised in 
the Commonwealth of Australia and a brief review of current opera- 
tions, together with statistics pertaining to the year 1911-12. The 
present chapter will deal simply with very recent developments in 
these States. 
New South Wales.—In New South Wales extensive provisions have 
been made for the instruction, of children who live in remote districts. 
This is done by means of (1) half-time schools under a single teacher, 
who devotes his time between two schools in such a way that during 
the week either is closed the elder pupils will have sufficient home 
exercises to enable them to make normal progress; (2) house-to-house 
teaching, for which the department supplies all necessary material; 
(3) subsidized schools, a private teacher being engaged by two or 
more families in combination, each family receiving a per capita grant 
of £5 or £6 per annum through the department; (4) conveyance to 
central school by van or steam launch (during 1912 children were so 
conveyed to 80 schools); (5) railway camp schools, which are held 
in tents with specially designed furniture, and which are opened 
along railway constructional works, moving as the work is shifted; 
(6) traveling schools on wheels, passing over districts assigned in turn. 
The new scheme of secondary education came into operation in 
1911; it provides for courses of study extending over four years, for 
new conditions of entrance, and the abolition of fees in the public 
high schools. The courses of study are intended to afford preparation. 
for various vocations and have accordingly been arranged in four 
groups, as follows: (1) General course leading to the professional 
studies of higher institutions; (2) commercial course; (3) technical 
887 
 
-P-A-G-E-942
  888 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
course; (4) domestic course. For admission to either course candi- 
date must have a qualifying certificate showing completion of the 
primary school. At the end of the first two years the successful 
student may receive the intermediate certificate; the leaving certifi- 
cate is secured by completion of the entire course and passing the 
prescribed final examinations. By arrangement with the university 
authorities the leaving certificate is accepted in lieu of entrance 
examinations. 
The movement for systematizing the work of continuation schools 
was begun in 1911, when the director of education was commissioned 
to make practical investigation of schools of this class in Great 
Britain and Europe for the purpose of recommending plans for 
similar schools in New South Wales. In his report the director 
advised the organization of evening continuation schools, as indus- 
trial, commercial, and domestic schools, and further that all pupils of 
the evening continuation schools should be required to take groups 
of subjects. THis report also made sweeping recommendations with 
respect to compulsory attendance upon these schools, including 
provisions on the part of employers and also on the part of the Gov- 
ernment itself, so far as it is an employer of labor, which should 
enable employees under 17 years of age to profit by the evening 
continuation schools. At the close of 1911, 18 continuation schools 
were in operation, with an average weekly enrollment of 1,597 pupils, 
and an average attendance of 1,162. In June, 1912, 21 such schools 
were in operation in the metropolitan district and 14 in country 
districts. 
The minister of public instruction, in his report for 1912, states 
that, in order to fulfill the purpose for which this provision is made, 
he is seriously considering the question of making it obligatory upon 
boys and girls of 16 years of age to attend continuation, schools unless 
otherwise educated, and of providing the means for their doing so by 
schools that will not involve their attendance during late evening 
hours. 
Queensland.—A system of itinerant teachers was introduced into 
Queensland by the appointment of one itinerant teacher to travel 
in the southwestern part of the State. As the settlements extended, 
the provision was increased, and at present 17 such teachers are at 
work throughout the State. These teachers are sent where there are 
neither provisional schools nor part-time schools, and the children 
they are trying to reach are those of prospectors, graziers, stockmen, 
timbermen, etc., who are unable to pay for tutors or governesses, or 
to send their children into the towns to be educated. 
The 17 itinerant teachers in 1912 covered over 55,000 miles in their 
attempts to carry instruction to 1,916 children of the remote districts 
of the State. It has been found advantageous, wherever possible, to
-P-A-G-E-943
  
AUSTRALIA, 889 
establish Saturday schools, which enable the children to meet their 
teacher once every week instead of two or three times a year. Accord- 
ing to the official report the children show surprising zeal and intelli- 
gence at these weekly meetings. Some of the pupils walk 5 miles to 
meet with the teacher. In several cases parents have written to the 
education department saying that the establishment of the Saturday 
school has enabled them to stay on the land. they have taken up, 
which otherwise they must have abandoned for the sake of their 
children. 
Among the important features introduced into the Queensland 
system by the school act of 1910 were the establishment of compulsory 
continuation classes; compulsory medical and dental examination of 
school children; raising the upper limit of compulsory attendance to 
14 years of age instead of 12; providing for compulsory attendance on 
every day on which the schools are open. 
South Australia.—South Australia has taken active measures for 
the provision of evening continuation schools and for the establish- 
ment of medical supervision of school children. This latter service 
has been started by the appointment of a medical officer, a dental 
officer, and two trained nurses. Special efforts have recently been 
made to insure an adequate force of trained teachers. In addition to 
the full course of the university training college, a short course was 
inaugurated in 1912, which has proved to be of great value. The 
attendance was large and many applications were received for 
admission at the next session. 
Victoria.—Under the amending education act of 1910, compulsory. 
school attendance is required in Victoria for the full period of 8 years, 
between the ages of 6 and 14; pupils meeting certain conditions may 
obtain exemption at 13 years of age. Special provision is made by 
the education department for the training of the mentally deficient. 
A council of public education has recently been formed for the purpose 
of insuring expert advice on educational matters generally, for the 
guidance of executive officers. 
Western Australia.—The education department of Western Aus- 
tralia opened a special school designed to give a four years’ course 
of training to children from 13 to 17 years of age, with specialization 
in the last two years in vocational directions. Continuation schools 
have been established in 14 different centers, and were attended last 
year by above a thousand pupils. 
Tasmania.—Like the remaining States of Australia, Tasmania has 
recently taken measures to advance the standard of education, and 
in January, 1913, two public high schools were established, one at 
Hobart and the other at Launcaston. These schools offer five 
separate courses of study, leading to professional studies or business 
careers.  
-P-A-G-E-944
890 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
  The education department has recently extended the work of 
medical inspection by the appointment of two trained nurses. The 
report of the medical officers for 1912 shows that the examination of 
school children is very fully carried out, and recommendations are 
made that it should at the earliest possible moment be supplemented 
by public provision for medical treatment where needed. Improve- 
ment in the personal habits, as well as in the health of the children, 
is an important result of this careful supervision. 
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. 
The universal interest manifested at the present time in the subject 
of religious instruction in public schools gives importance to what has 
come to be known as the system of New South Wales. The principal 
features of this system, which were particularly discussed in the 
conference on moral education held at The Hague, in August, 1912, 
are as follows: 
The school teacher in school hours gives selected Bible lessons from a book provided 
for the purpose, but is not allowed to give sectarian tediching. Any minister of 
religion is entitled in school hours, on days to be arranged with the school committee, 
to give children of his own denomination, separated from others, an hour’s religious 
instruction. Any parent may withdraw his child from all religious teaching if he 
objects to such religious instruction being given. The Scripture lesson textbookshave 
been used in New South Wales schools since 1848. There are a series of set questions 
at the end of each lesson; also valuable footnotes with a list of words and phrases to 
be explained. 
Religious instruction has also been adopted by Tasmania, Western 
Australia, and Queensland (the last in 1910), and its introduction 
into Victoria, South Australia, and New Zealand is under consid- 
eration. 
NEW ZEALAND. 
STATUS OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The report of the minister of education issued during 1913, and 
covering the year 1912, shows that New Zealand is maintaining 
the high standard which has long characterized the schools of that 
colony. The enrollment in public primary schools for 1912 was 
164,492, equivalent to 16.3 per cent of the population, exclusive of 
aborigines. On this enrollment an average attendance of 88.9 per 
cent was maintained, a slightly lower ratio than that for the previous 
year, viz, 89.3, the falling off being due to epidemics. The enroll- 
ment in private primary schools and lower departments of secondary 
schools would raise the total above given to 17.7 per cent of the 
population and would not materially lower the ratio of attendance, 
since the private schools, as a rule, come under State inspection in 
order to receive subsidies from the public treasury. These are 
based upon the inspectors’ reports.
-P-A-G-E-945
NEW ZEALAND. 891 
  With regard to the public schools, it is noticeable that a compara- 
tively large proportion of the pupils reach a grade as high as the 
sixth. The compulsory school age is from 7 to 14, but children can 
be admitted into school at 5 years of age. The statistics show that 
the largest proportion of the pupils attending school at any given 
time are 8 or 9 years of age. For 1912 the attendance of children of 
the former age was 19,899, nearly all of whom were either in stand- 
ard I or II; but the total number in standard VI was 9,920, or about 
half the number in the lower standard. Not only is the compulsory 
law well enforced, but children under 14 can not get exemption 
from school attendance unless they are able to pass certain exami- 
nations; hence there is every inducement for them to remain in 
school, whether they are pupils of public or private institutions. 
Provision is made for the instruction of children who live remote 
from schools by conveyance at public expense, by rail, by water, or 
by carriage road. The total amount paid by the State to education 
boards for conveyance in 1912 amounted to £14,691 ($73,455). 
During. the year under review the service of medical inspection of 
schools and school children was brought into operation, under the 
joint control of the education department and the department of 
public health. Four medical inspectors were appointed, one being 
stationed at each of the four chief centers of the colony. The min- 
ister states that— 
From the experience of older countries where systems of medical inspection have 
been in operation for some time it is not thought necessary to examine each child 
more than twice, or at the most three times, in the course of his primary school life, 
except in cases of suspected or proved abnormality. It was accordingly decided to 
begin by regular inspection of the children averaging 10 to 11 years of age. Asarule 
the medical inspector inspects these children in any school on the first day of his 
visit, and on the second day examines special cases from other classes brought under 
his notice by the head teacher or selected. by himself. 
An important part of the inspectors’ work is to train the teachers to do their share of 
medical inspection, for in those countries where the system is most successful the 
cooperation of the teachers has been found to be a most important factor. Accord- 
ingly, the medical inspector is always accompanied by a teacher, who in this way 
learns much as to the aims and methods of medical inspection. 
This individual training is supplemented by courses of Saturday lectures given to 
the teachers residing in or near each important center visited.. More extensive courses 
of lectures are given to training-college students. Notices are sent to parents of chil- 
dren in cases where the inspection shows that medical or dental treatment is required; 
no cases are, however, treated by the inspectors; parents are recommended to take 
their children to their own medical advisers. 
The teaching force employed for the primary schools is compara-) 
tively large, numbering, in 1912, 4,743, of whom 1,717 were men. 
The average salaries for adult teachers, exclusive of house allowances, 
amounted for men to $1,025, and for women to $620, more than half 
the male teachers receiving each $1,000 a year. The disproportion
-P-A-G-E-946
    892 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
between the salaries of men and women is explained by the fact that 
many of the rural schools are extremely small and easily managed by 
women, and the men in the rural districts are wanted for other work. 
New Zealand has made special efforts with respect to educating the 
children of natives, and in 1912 there were reported 108 native village 
schools, exceeding the number for any former year. There were also 
Maori pupils in attendance at 569 of the public schools. The total 
attendance at the native village schools was 4,694, which included 
520 children of European parents. 
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Provision for secondary education is made by endowed or other 
private schools, which, however, receive grants from the treasury. 
State scholarships are also maintained by means of which childrens’ 
parents who can not pay for their tuition are enabled to continue 
their studies, and the law also authorizes the establishment of ad- 
vanced classes in public schools where no secondary schools exist. 
Higher education is provided by four institutions, the Otago Uni- 
versity at Dunedin, Canterbury College at Christchurch, Aukland 
University College and Victoria College at Wellington, all affiliated 
to the University of New Zealand, which is an examining body. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
New Zealand has been distinguished by the provision made for 
technical training. In addition to technical evening classes which 
are maintained near the larger towns, there are eight day technical 
schools which are maintained by the combined action of the munici- 
palities, industrial and trade organizations, and the Government. 
The three largest technical schools in the Dominion are situated, 
respectively, at Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin. Interest in 
the higher technicai schools is promoted by the very ample provision 
made for manual training and the simpler forms of tool work, both in 
the public and secondary schools. In many cases the public schools 
are provided with special buildings for manual instruction. 
EXPENDITURE. 
The total public expenditure on education in New Zealand for 
1912-13 was £1,234,827 ($6,174,135). Of this amount £851,675 
($4,258,375) was used for elementary education; manual and tech- 
nical instruction was responsible for £93,289 ($466,445); higher edu- 
cation received from the treasury £25,180 ($125,900). The report 
of the education commission, which was submitted in 1912, has 
excited great interest and widespread discussion throughout the col- 
ony, but political conditions have thus far prevented definite action 
upon the recommendations presented. It may be said, however, 
that public sentiment is rapidly moving toward a closer coordination 
of all the teaching institutions and larger provision for free education,

EVENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEREST. 
ConTENTS.—International foundations: Amerika-Institut; American association for international concili- 
ation. International congresses and expositions: International congress for the protection of child- 
hood; Twenty-seventh international medical congress; congresses in connection with the interna- 
tional exposition at Ghent; additional international congresses, 1913. Congresses and expositions 
announced for 1914: The Adria exposition; International bureau federation of teachers, eighth annual 
reunion, Brussels, 1913; Report on the Montessori system and on luminous views with the cinemato- 
graph or other apparatus for the use of schools. 
INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATIONS. 
AMERIKA-INSTITUT, 
The Amerika-Institut, founded at Berlin in November, 1910, under 
the auspices of the Prussian minister of education, was described in 
the Commissioner’s Report for 1912 (see p. 617), Every year gives 
proof of the importance of this institution as a means of strengthen- 
ing the cultural relations between Germany and the United States 
by its service as a medium of inquiry and exchange in regard to mat- 
ters pertaining to education and scholarly research, literature and 
art, technics and social welfare, the promotion of peace and inter- 
national understanding. The present director of the Amerika- 
Institut is Dr. R. B. Drechsler. The office is located in the new 
building of the Royal Library, Berlin. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR INTERNATIONAL CONCILIATION. 
Among permanent results of the first Hague conference, which 
took place in 1899, was the establishment by Baron d’Estournelles 
de Constant of the ‘‘Conciliation Internationale.” The first branch 
of this central body was the American Association for International 
Conciliation; branches have since been. organized in other countries, 
and it is expected that new branches will be started in the near 
future. 
All branch associations look to the association in Paris as the parent 
and model, but they are in every sense independent societies. Their 
relations with the parent society and with each other, while close and 
cooperative, are informal and involve no other than moral obligations, 
The parent society and all the branches use a common seal and 
the same motto, which appears on the front page of publications 
issued by them.

-P-A-G-E-948
  894 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
A program of international conciliation, issued by Baron d’Estour- 
nelles de Constant in 1905, in which he states clearly the reasons 
leading to the organization in Paris, its aims and purposes, as well 
as the methods to carry them into effect, is in general the program 
of branch associations. 
The executive committee of the American Association for Inter- 
national Conciliation includes among its members Nicholas Murray 
Butler, president of Columbia University; Hon. Seth Low, former 
mayor of New York; Lyman Abbott, editor of the Outlook; and 
Hon. Robert Bacon. 
THE PAN-AMERICAN DIVISION. 
The Pan-American division of the American association has been 
recently organized for the special purpose of promoting closer intel- 
lectual and cultural relations between the peoples of the Republics 
of America by the methods outlined in the general program. The 
special program of this division covers the following operations: The 
collection and diffusion of information with reference to the social 
and intellectual life and institutions of the several American Repub- 
lics; the cultivation of friendly feelings between these Republics 
through the voluntary interchange of students, teachers, and pro- 
fessors; international visits of representative men and women; the 
encouragement of the study of the Spanish and Portuguese languages 
in the United States and of the English language in the other Ameri- 
ean Republics, and of a fuller provision in the higher institutions of 
learning for the study of the political and social life of the several 
Republics. 
This work is undertaken by the association with the approval and 
support of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and is 
a part of the Endowment’s consistent policy to promote international 
peace by working to bring about closer and more effective knowledge 
of foreign countries and their respective civilizations. 
The organizing director of the division is Dr. Harry Erwin Bard, 
with office at the headquarters of the American association, at 407 
West 117th Street, New York. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES AND EXPOSITIONS. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDHOOD. 
The International Congress for the Protection of Childhood was 
held at Brussels, July 23-26, 1913, under the auspices of the King 
of Belgium and the immediate direction of the ministers of foreign

affairs, of the interior, and of justice. The organizing committee 
appointed to promote the interests of the congress comprised repre- 
sentatives of 19 countries, in addition to Belgium itself. The final 
arrangements were in charge of an executive committee, of which 
the acting president was M. Adolphe Prins, professor at the Uni- 
versity of Brussels. 
This congress was the outcome of long-continued efforts to create 
in Belgium an international center for the various private societies 
and public agencies engaged in different countries in the care and 
protection of childhood. These efforts on the part of Belgium have 
been manifested by the organization of several international con- 
gresses, of which the first was held in 1894 at Antwerp. On this 
occasion an international committee was formed to make arrange- 
ments for suecessive congresses for the consideration and solution 
of problems connected with the protection of children. The com- 
mittee, which received the name of international patronage committee, 
met at Geneva in August, 1896, and at Brussels in November of 
the same year, at which latter meeting the by-laws regulating its 
activities were drawn up. At this meeting also it was decided 
that the committee should seek governmental recognition. 
Suceeeding congresses were held at Liege in 1905 and at Antwerp 
in 1911. At the Antwerp congress it was decided to create an 
international bureau for the promotion of the purposes of the con- 
gress, and this was eventually located at Liege and is supported by 
appropriations from several governments. 
The object of the congress held during the current year was to 
crown. the work for which previous congresses had laid the founda- 
tion, in particular by creating an international bureau for the pro- 
tection of childhood. 
INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CONGRESS. 
The Twenty-seventh International Medical Congress, which met at 
London, August 6-12, 1913, was remarkable in respect to the dele- 
gates participating and the character of the papers presented. Among 
the subjects considered, special interest was excited by a review of 
the advance in medical science during the three decades that have 
elapsed since the previous meeting of the congress in London in 1881. 
Among the evidences of this advance, special emphasis was given 
to the work of Pasteur and Lister, the two prominent figures of the 
previous congress in London. It was observed that “time and the 
progress of science have but emphasized the magnitude of their 
contributions to medicine and surgery.” 
The tendency toward a “rapprochement between medicine and 
surgery,” involving “the adoption by each branch of the medical 
art of what is best in the other,” was dwelt upon; and the recogni-  
-P-A-G-E-950

tion of the “expanding field of medical thought and action,” with 
corresponding increase of responsibility upon the medical practi- 
tioner. Attention was also called to ‘the growing importance of 
the new science of genetics, or eugenics, to medical practice.” 
At the concluding meeting of the congress Mr. John Burns, the 
president of the local government board, delivered an address on 
“the success of preventive medicine during the last three decades.” 
He noted— 
a falling death rate; the practical disappearance of typhus fever; enteric fever reduced 
to one-third; tuberculosis reduced to one-half; smallpox, scarlet fever, diarrhea, and 
dysentery materially controlled. 
“The essential unity and solidarity of medicine” were illustrated 
by the presence of “more than 7,000 representatives and 25 nation- 
alities meeting in fraternal and cordial intercourse’ on this memor- 
able occasion.! 
CONGRESSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION 
AT GHENT. 
The Kingdom of Belgium was the scene of many international 
congresses during the current year, the place of meeting having been 
determined by the international exposition, which was held at Ghent. 
Among these congresses was the Second International Congress on the 
Teaching of Domestic Science and Arts, Ghent, June 15-19. 
In the same month (June 15-18) a world congress of international 
associations was called together, part of the sessions being held at 
Brussels and the remainder at Ghent. The chief purpose of this con- 
gress was to take measures for creating a central office to serve as 
the executive organ of the united association. 
The Third International Congress of the Associations of Agricul- 
tural Women (Cercles de Fermiéres), held at Ghent, is noticed else- 
where in this report (see p. 783). 
ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES, 
The dates and places of assembly of additional international con- 
gresses of which notice was received at the Bureau of Education 
were as follows: 
An International Congress on Physical Education was held at the 
Faculty of Medicine in Paris in March, 1913. ~ 
The Tenth International Geographic Congress was held at Rome, 
Italy, March 27 to April 2, 1913.

‘The Fourth International Congress on School Hygiene was held 
at Buffalo, N. Y., August 25-30. An account of this congress ap- 
pears elsewhere in this report (page 563). 
At Budapest, Hungary, August 6 to 14, an international steno- 
graphic congress was held in continuation of the tenth congress, which 
convened at Madrid in 1912. 
In the same city, August 31 to September 5, the Tenth International 
Congress of Commercial Education convened. 
The Adria Exposition, held at Vienna during the current year by 
decree of the Emperor, offered in graphic display a review of the 
advance in civilization, the rich historical past, and the superb 
natural beauty of the Adriatic countries. The exposition included 
treasures of sculpture and painting, and literary and musical col- 
lections. These purposes were completed by the exhibition of the 
products of the sea and the mainland, technical achievements in 
ship building, and proofs of the development of navigation, industry, 
and commerce. Wide announcement was made of the exposition, 
with a view of attracting sightseers from all parts of the world. 
CONGRESSES AND EXPOSITIONS ANNOUNCED FOR 1914. 
An Anglo-American exposition will be held in’ London between 
May and October, 1914, to celebrate the 100 years of peace and 
progress between the English-speaking peoples since the treaty of 
Ghent in 1814. The exposition will comprise British and American 
art, inventions, the advancement in navigation, transportation, con- 
structive engineering, printing, transmission of messages and signals, 
progress in education, science, literature, etc. The preliminary 
arrangements for the exposition are in charge of general committees, 
including men of great prominence and influence in Great Britain 
and the United States. 
The International Conference on the Blind will be held 2 at London 
June 18-20, 1914. 
The Fourth International Congress of American Students will be 
held at Santiago, Chile, in July, 1914. 
The Congress for the Embellishment of Rural Life is to be held in 
Belgium during 1914; dates not yet determined. 
An International Exhibition for Commercial Education will be 
jeld at Leipzig from May to October, 1914. 
The Sixth International Dental Congress will be held at London, 
August 3-8, 1914.

and civic bodies. The president of the congress is Dr. M. G. Brum- 
baugh, superintendent of schools, Philadelphia. The President of the 
United States has accorded his patronage to the congress. The Com- 
missioner of Education, Dr. P. P. Claxton, has accepted the chair- 
manship of the ninth section; subject “The home and the school in 
cooperation for the education of the child—Voeational education 
expansion.” 
BUREAU INTERNATIONAL DE FEDERATIONS D’INSTITUTEURS. 
(Internationa) Bureau Federation of Teachers.) 
The year 1913 is the eighth of the existence of the International 
Bureau of Federation of Teachers. This bureau has held its succes- 
sive annual reunions at Munich, Paris, London, Prague, again at 
Paris, Berlin, and Amsterdam. Out of its activities also grew the 
Second International Congress of Primary Education held at Paris 
in 1910. The annual report of the bureau for 1908, the first which 
contained information as to its membership, showed that eight 
national federations were combined, making an effective total of 
151,000 members. 
The report for 1912 shows encouraging progress. The number of 
federations comprised had reached 18 and a total membership of 
411,000 members. Furthermore, the bureau has correspondents in 
four countries which, it is expected, will furnish affiliated members in 
the near future. 
The present year has also been marked by great improvement in 
the reports of the national associations, setting forth the nature 
and purposes of their activities. 
Among the important societies included in this bureau, with their 
presidents, when known, are: 
Deutscher Lehrerverein. President, Herr. N. Rohl, N., 65 Seestr., 63, Berlin. 
Deutsch-Osterreichischer Lehrerbund. 
Fédération générale des Instituteurs belges. Président, M. Ferrier, instituteur, quai 
de la Boverie, 13, Liége. 
Asociacién Nacional del Magisterio Primario. 
Fédération des Amicales de France. Président, M. Roussel, rue de Vaugirard, Paris. 
Norges Loererlag. President, O. J. Hoversholm, overlaerer, Kristiania. 
Schweizerischer Lehrerverein. President, M. Fr. Fritschi, Sekundarlehrer, Stein- 
wiesstr., 18, Zurich V. 
England is represented in the association by many members, but 
no one of the educational associations appears to have joined as a 
body. 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON THE MONTESSORI SYSTEM. 
This federation considers at each annual session subjects of timely 
interest pertaining to primary education. At the eighth annual
-P-A-G-E-953
  
CONGRESS AND EXPOSITIONS IN 1914, 899 
séssion held at Brussels in 1913, the report of a committee appointed 
to consider the Montessori method was presented by the president of 
the federation, M. Ch. Rossignol. The report comprised an extended 
synopsis of the system as set forth by Dr. Montessori in her work 
entitled ‘‘Tl Metodo della pedagogia scientifica.”” The report closed 
with a series of questions suggesting, but not affirming, the conclu- 
sions reached by the committee. 
(1) Can the Montessori system be introduced into the primary schools of to-day 
with an attendance reaching often 60 and even 70 pupils? 
(2) Is the principle of liberty or of respect for the personality of the pupil, as defined 
by Madam Montessori, compatible with the process of education as it is understood 
and given in schools of a higher grade than the Montessori school? 
(3) Or, tostate the inquiry negatively, is it not desirable to change the management 
of primary and secondary schools, inasmuch as one has to increase the respect for the 
personality of the pupil? 
(4) How many children should be confided to a single Montessorian teacher? 
. (5) When the child is at school should he be allowed to feel that the work is free, 
or ought he to have imparted to him the idea of obligation of doing what is ordered by 
the teacher? 
(6) Is not the idea of teaching a child to read in three years a pedagogical heresy? 
(7) Is not the Montessori system best adapted to open our schools where no rule is 
imposed? 
(8) Respecting the Montessori system, is it not desirable that every one should 
suspend judgment until the time when experiments have been made in different 
countries by teachers specially prepared for the work? 
CINEMATOGRAPHS IN SCHOOLS, 
A second subject considered at the same session dealt with the 
matter of luminous views as aids to instruction. Two reports were 
presented on this subject, comprising accounts of several examinations 
of the use of these aids that have appeared in contemporary journals 
or in reports of local teachers’ associations. In view of the opinions 
and the results of experiments set forth in the articles and reports 
referred to, the conclusion was reached that the use of such views in 
schools gives fuller and more complete ideas of subjects, because they 
resemble closely the things themselves. This fact has long been under- 
stood by publishers of classical works, who place upon the market only 
illustrated dictionaries. By the aid of these pictorial illustrations 
pupils can see in an hour what it would take a year’s instruction to 
impart, and the painting of the faithful image of the thing is indelibly 
impressed upon the young and impressionable brain. 
It is comparatively easy for great cities to secure cinematographs 
and films relative to different subjects of instruction. This requires 
a first expense of some thousands, and an annual expense of per- 
haps $100. Smaller places content themselves with reflectoscopes 
and a few series of pictures, which cost altogether perhaps $60 or 
$100.
-P-A-G-E-954
  900 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
The formal reports on the subject which were presented by M. Ros- 
signol, president of the federation, and by M. Skarvig, of Copenhagen, 
agreed in commending the use of the views, both moving and fixed, and 
in the conviction that cities could easily meet the necessary expense; 
on the contrary, it appeared that small towns and rural districts would 
have to be aided in this matter by the State or make use of traveling 
exhibits.

CHAPEER XLII. 
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913.1 
ContENTS.—Survey commissions—Compulsory attendance—Length of term—Rural schools—Vorational 
education—Medical inspection and health teaching—Wider use of the school plant—The State super- 
intendent—High schools and teacher-training—Teachers’ pensions—Buildings and grounds—Text- 
books—School fraternities. 
The legislatures of 42 States were in session during 1912-13. 
While the actual volume of school laws was no greater than in other 
years, in respect to single pieces of constructive school legislation the 
year was conspicuous. Chief lines of activity were vocational edu- 
cation, including agricultural education; school hygiene, with special 
reference to medical inspection; rural school betterment; and the 
wider use of the school plant—in all of which a persistent campaign is 
resulting in permanently valuable legislation. At the same time 
some notable progress was made in enacting laws affecting the funda- 
mental but less novel matters of compulsory school attendance, 
length of school term, and professional improvement of the teaching 
profession as measured by teachers’ retirement laws and multiplica- 
tion of teacher-training courses. Two States—Montana and Okla- 
homa—adopted new school codes, and Idaho made a number of 
changes in the code of 1911. 
SURVEY COMMISSIONS. 
In three States—Ohio, Minnesota, and Vermont—the legislature 
authorized the creation of commissions to make complete educational 
surveys. The Indiana commission of the previous year had come 
mainly from the vocational education motive. None of the three 
current enactments was quite so distinctly vocational in purpose. 
The Ohio survey, authorized by the resolution of March 11, 1913, 
was largely an inquiry into rural educational facilities; it has been one 
of the most fruitful investigations ever undertaken by any State, 
resulting already (January, 1914) in valuable legislation. In Ver- 
mont the purpose was more general. A commission of nine members 
authorized by act of November 19, 1912, was appointed by the 
governor to ‘investigate the educational system of the State.”

school administration.

902 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
Both of these surveys are conspicuous for the spirit of scientific 
inquiry which has marked them throughout. Further details of 
these surveys are given elsewhere in this report.* 
Minnesota’s public education commission, created under the act 
of April 28, is to “study the educational system of the State, revise 
and collate the school laws, and report to the governor not later than 
December 1, 1914.” 
In Connecticut the legislature directed the State board of education 
to codify the school laws and the laws relating to the employment of 
children and to report with recommendations to the next session of 
the legislature. California has arranged for what promises to be a 
very thorough investigation of one of the modern phases of educa- 
tion—the play movement. A recreational inquiry committee has 
been appointed, pursuant to the resolution of June 2, 1913, for 
“studying, investigating, and reporting with recommendations upon 
recreation for both young and old in California, including recreation 
in rural communities as well as in small and large towns and cities.” 
This is particularly welcome in its explicit recognition of the social 
and recreational needs of the open country. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
The six States previously reported as without compulsory school 
attendance laws are still without them, despite heroic efforts on the 
part of the friends of public education in the four of these States in 
which sessions were held. An especially vigorous effort was put forth 
in Texas. On the other hand, advances are to be recorded in two 
other States where conditions had been little better than in States 
entirely without compulsory laws. North Carolina and Tennessee, 
where compulsory attendance was operative only in certain counties, 
now have compulsory laws that apply everywhere in those States. 
The Tennessee law (ch. 9) makes compulsory education State-wide 
for children 8 to 14 years of age; also 14 to 16 if the child is not law- 
fully employed. In localities of less than 5,000 population 80 days’ 
attendance will be accepted as fulfilling the law; in larger cities it 
must be for ‘full term.” Truant officers and truancy schools are 
provided for in cities of 10,000 population and over. 
The North Carolina act is more elaborate than that of Tennessee, 
but hardly so specific; it shows the inevitable results of compromise. 
The ages affected are 8 to 12 years, and the required period four 
months of the school term of each year. Attendance at ‘‘private or 
church schools taught by competent teachers” may be accepted in 
lieu of attendance upon the local public schools, provided this attend- 
ance is for four months continuously. Private schools will be required 
1 See pp. 207-210,
-P-A-G-E-957
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913. 903 
to keep records of attendance and render reports identical with those 
of the public schools. In Mitchell County the upper limit for compul- 
sory attendance is made 15 years, and in Polk County the ages are 7 
to 15 years. Other exemptions are, briefly: Abnormal physical or 
mental condition as attested by a physician; distance of 2} miles or 
more from the schoolhouse; extreme poverty, making it necessary for 
the child to aid in his own support or the support of his parents; or— 
in any case in which said parent, guardian, or other person having charge or control 
of the child shall show before any magistrate, by affidavit of himself and of such wit- 
nesses as the attendance officer may require, that the child is without necessary books 
and clothing for attending school, and that he is unable to provide the necessary books 
and clothes: Provided, that when books and clothing shall have been provided, 
through charity or by other means, the child shall no longer be exempt from attend- 
ance under this provision. 
The North Carolina law is to be enforced by an attendance officer 
for each township, appointed by the county board of: education. 
The attendance officer is also to serve as taker of the school census 
and keeper of attendance records, and is to be allowed for that 
service 3 cents per child of school age each school year. The law is 
carefully hedged about with provisions to compel cooperation on the 
part of teachers, school officers, public officials, and parents. Strin- 
gent penalties are provided. 
Most of the compulsory attendance legislation of the year affects 
the difficult period of 14 to 16 years. New Jersey’s action is typical 
of the uncertainty that prevails. New Jersey was one of the first 
States to make school attendance compulsory up to 16 years, with 
certain familiar exceptions. The 1913 act modifies New Jersey’s 
stand somewhat. It is now provided that a child between 14 and 16 
must attend school unless— 
he regularly attended school at least 130 days during the preceding year; is able to 
read intelligently and write legibly simple sentences in the English language; has 
completed a course of study equal to five yearly grades in reading, writing, spelling, 
English language, and geography; is familiar with the fundamental operations in 
arithmetic, including simple fractions; has been granted an age and schooling certifi- 
cate; and is regularly employed in some useful occupation or service. 
Issuance of the age and schooling certificate is conditioned on the 
filing of a certificate from the medical examiner showing that the 
child is physically able to perform any work in which a child between 
the ages of 14 and 16 may legally be employed. This action is of 
particular interest in view of the repeated and well-substantiated 
claims of the vocational guidance experts that there are no jobs for 
children under 16 years of age that they should be allowed to take. 
The Michigan act of 1913 makes this State one of the most advanced 
in compulsory requirements. The period of compulsion is made 7 to 
16 for the entire term of school. Holders of eighth-grade diplomas 
are exempt, as are also “children over 14 years of age if needed for
-P-A-G-E-958
  904 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
the support of their parents’’—a provision which is not as dangerous 
in Michigan as it might be in other States, because of Michigan’s 
strict child-labor law. Minor exemptions include children under 9 
years of age if not within 24 miles of a schoolhouse, and if no trans- 
portation is furnished; and any child between 12 and 14 years of 
age while attending confirmation classes for not exceeding five 
months. 
New Hampshire’s new attendance law changes the provision for 
children between 14 and 16 from the general requirement, “must be 
able to read at sight and write legibly simple sentences,” to the 
specific requirement of completion of the prescribed course of study 
for the elementary schools (ch. 221). 
The Iowa provision (ch. 255) makes compulsory attendance apply 
to children 7 to 16 (hitherto 14), exempting children over 14 when 
lawfully employed and when possessed of qualifications equivalent 
to graduation from the eighth grade. 
The new Ohio law makes special efforts to safeguard children 
under 16. The law raises the compulsory age limit to 15 years, if 
male, and 16 years, if female. Parents or guardians must send the 
child “for the full time that the school attended is in session,” 
which in no case is to be less than 28 weeks. Attendance must begin 
during the first week of the school term, unless the child is under 
competent instruction at home, this to be decided by the superin- 
tendent of schools. Boys between the ages of 15 and 16 not engaged 
in some regular employment are obliged to attend school. One of the 
results of the new law was practically to eliminate the field of the 
compulsory continuation school, which Cincinnati had cultivated so 
successfully. Asst. Supt. Roberts, of that city, points out: 
The new law leaves subject to the old unchanged continuation-school law only 
those boys at work between 15 and 16 who have not finished the eighth grade. How- 
ever, under an interpretation of the attorney general, which construes as valid all age 
and schooling certificates issued before the new law went into effect in August, all 
children thus at work and subject to the law are attending continuation classes. 
The law contains a carefully considered provision for the issue of 
age and schooling certificates. Such a certificate must be presented 
by every boy under 16 and every girl under 18 who seeks any kind 
of employment, and employers are required to keep these certificates 
on file for inspection by the truant officer or officer of the department 
of workshops and factories. Certificates will be issued only after 
proof has been furnished that the child, if a boy, has passed a satis- 
factory sixth-grade test, and if a girl, the seventh-grade test, this 
proof to be furnished by a “juvenile examiner” in city school dis- 
tricts, who may either examine the child or accept the records of the 
school attended, if he is satisfied that its standards are sufficiently 
high. If a boy between 15 and 16 loses his employment, he is com-
-P-A-G-E-959
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913, 905 
pelled to report the fact at once to the superintendent of schools, and 
he will be required to return to school after two weeks if other employ- 
ment has not been obtained. The law further requires health cer-- 
tificates from boys between 15 and 16 who seek employment, but 
this certificate may be waived if the records of the school physician 
show that the pupil’s previous health has been sound. 
Indiana also legislated on compulsory education for the period 14 
to 16 years of age; the employment certificate must show that the 
applicant has passed fifth grade, instead of sixth grade, as in Ohio. 
In Massachusetts important legislation was enacted on employment 
of minors, much of it covering the period 14 to 16 years of age (ch. 
831; also 779 and 805). Massachusetts also extended the compulsory 
provision to require attendance at public evening schools, where such 
exist, of all illiterate minors between 16 and 21 for a sufficient period 
to learn to read and write (ch. 467). 
LENGTH OF TERM. 
In seven States laws were enacted making more or less important 
changes in length of school term. The action of these States varied 
as widely as the standards of education vary in the United States, but 
the net result was a real gain. Most noteworthy was the action of 
North Carolina in providing for a minimum school term of six months 
in every public school in the State, and appropriating $250,000 for 
carrying out the law, the money to be apportioned according to school 
population. The act further provides that 5 cents of the annual State 
tax levied on the $100 of valuation shall be set aside as ‘a ‘‘State 
equalizing school fund.” 
Nebraska has raised the minimum school term from three to four 
months for districts having fewer than 20 pupils. For districts having 
20 to 75 pupils the minimum has been raised from 6 to 8 months; and 
a district having more than 75 pupils must have a school term of not 
less than 9months. Every district must keep school open 9 months 
if this can be done on a levy of 15 mills, and for 8 months if it can be 
done on a levy of 20 mills. 
Missouri, in reenacting the statute relating to length of term, 
broadens its application to include State aid for all counties not ex- 
ceeding $50,000 assessed valuation (was $40,000), and omits con- 
ditions of area of district and number of children of school age. The 
only condition is that an average attendance of 15 pupils must be 
maintained, but in lieu of this an attendance of 60 per cent of the 
school population, whatever it is, will be accepted. The maximum 
amount of State aid is increased from $80 to $100 annually. New 
Mexico makes further provision for holding school for at least five 
months in every district by offering not exceeding $300 for building 
or completing schoolhouses and not exceeding $50 for furnishing the
-P-A-G-E-960
  906 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
schoolroom (ch. 75). In Vermont the period of school attendance 
required of every child every year was increased from 140 to 150 days. 
‘New York continues its notable progress in bringing rural schools up 
to an advanced State standard by requiring, in the amended law, 
(ch. 511) that school be conducted for 180 days, instead of 160, 
throughout the State, as a condition of receiving money by State 
apportionment. A deficiency not exceeding 6 days will be allowed 
for teachers to attend teachers’ conferences held by district superin- 
tendents. 
RURAL SCHOOLS. 
The lengthening of term referred to in the foregoing paragraphs is 
in the main an item of progress in rural schools. In the States cited 
the lengthened term refers almost entirely to the country, the cities 
throughout the United States having long since reached astandard of 
180 days or more. There are other definite instances of rural school 
progress in the 1913 legislation. The Florida Legislature passed a 
law creating two State rural school inspectors at salaries of $2,000, to 
devote all of their time to visiting and supervising the rural schools of 
the State. An allowance of $1,250 is made to each officer for traveling 
expenses. 
The movement for consolidation of rural schools still produces much 
legislation. Missouri, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Idaho have 
legislated on the subject in the past year. The Missouri act provides 
that the qualified voters of any community in Missouri may organize 
a consolidated school district for the purpose of maintaining both 
elementary schools and high schools. No consolidated district may 
be formed that does not contain at lest 12 square miles or have an 
enumeration of at least 200 children of school age. With regard to 
transportation the provision is as follows: 
If transportation is not provided for in any school district formed under the provisions 
of this act, it shall then be the duty of the board of directors to maintain an elementary 
school within 2} miles, by the nearest traveled road, of the home of every child of school 
age within said school district: Provided, further, that if transportation is not provided 
for, any consolidated district may by a majority vote at any annual or special meeting 
decide to have all the seventh-grade and the eighth-grade work done at the central 
high-school building. 
As an aid to consolidation, the State of Missouri will pay one-fourth 
of the amount required, up to $2,000, for building and equipping a 
central high-school building. To meet State requirements the dis- 
trict must provide this central building with a site of not less than 
5 acres. The building itself must contain one large assembly room 
for meetings of the citizens of the district and must have a modern 
system of heating and ventilating. In Tennessee each county board 
of education is given authority to consolidate two or more schools 
and provide transportation of the pupils out of county school funds. 
 
-P-A-G-E-961
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913. 907 
Wisconsin provides special State aid on a graduated plan to defray 
half the cost of erecting and equipping buildings for consolidated 
districts as follows: Consolidated schools maintaining one depart- 
ment, $500; two departments, $1,500; three departments, $2,000; 
four or more departments, $3,000; township graded school and high 
school, $5,000. State aid will also be given for transportation under 
certain specified conditions—transportation to be provided for at 
least 32 weeks; average daily attendance of transported pupils must 
be at least 80 per cent of the entire number enrolled for transporta- 
tion; driver to be of thoroughly responsible character and with a suit- 
able and comfortable conveyance. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. 
The definiteness of the trade and industrial side of the vocational 
education movement is reflected in the vocational legislation of the 
year. The new laws of Indiana, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are 
similar in their careful definition of the differing fields of vocational 
education; in fact, they were written largely under the direct advice 
of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, 
and follow closely the program formulated by that organization at 
the meeting in Philadelphia in December, 1912.1. In Indiana the 
vocational education law was the outcome of a special investigation of 
conditions in that State. The law is characterized by an insistence 
upon instruction with general industrial aims even in the grades. 
The following section will illustrate: 
Elementary agriculture shall be taught in the grades in all town and township 
schools; elementary industrial work shall be taught in the grades in all city and town 
schools; and elementary domestic science shall be taught in the grades in all city, 
town, and township schools. The State board of education shall outline a course of 
study for each of such grades as they may determine, which shall be followed as a 
minimum requirement. 
The law provides that after September 1, 1915, all teachers required 
to teach elementary agriculture, industrial work, or domestic science 
shall have passed an examination in such subjects prepared by the 
State board of education. 
For carrying out the law the State board of education was recon- 
stituted to consist of the superintendent of public instruction; the 
presidents of Purdue University, the State University, and the State 
normal school; the superintendents of schools of the three cities hav- 
ing the largest number of children enumerated for school purposes; 
three citizens actively engaged in educational work in the State, at 
least one of whom shall be a county superintendent of schools; and 
“three persons actively interested in, and of known sympathy with, 
vocational education, one of whom shall be a representative of em- 
1 See Educ. Rep., 1912, Vol. I, ch. 10, pp. 290-291. 2 Ibidem, Vol. I, ch. 9, pp. 277-280. 
 
-P-A-G-E-962
908 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
ployees and one of employers.” The State superintendent, with the 
advice and approval of the State board of education, is empowered to 
appoint a deputy superintendent in charge of industrial education and 
domestic science. For agricultural education, the State superintend- 
entis authorized to cooperate with Purdue University in the appoint- 
ment of ‘‘some person actually connected with the agricultural 
extension work at Purdue,’ as an agent in supervising agricultural 
education, who shall serve in a dual capacity as an agent of the State 
superintendent and assistant at Purdue University. Provision is also 
made for county agents, to cooperate with farmers’ institutes, farmers’ 
clubs, and other organizations; to conduct practical farm demonstra- 
tions, boys’ and girls’ clubs, and contest work and other movements 
for the advancement of agriculture and country life; and to give 
advice to farmers on practical farm problems and aid the county 
superintendent of schools and the teachers in giving practical educa- 
tion in agriculture and domestic science. A State fund for vocational 
education is established by the annual levy, as a part of the State 
common school levy, of 1 cent additional on each $100 of taxable 
property in the State. 
New Jersey provides for the establishment of State-aided voca- 
tional schools. Two methods of organization are recognized, (a) 
as separate schools, (6) as departments of other schools. When 
organized as a separate school, the vocational school must be in a 
building used solely for the work. It must have a separate organiza- 
tion for curricula, equipment, pupils, and teachers. While this school 
is a separate and distinct organization, it is, nevertheless, under the 
direct control of the board of education of the district organizing and 
maintaining it. When organized as a department of another school, 
it must be independent of the rest of the school in its vocational 
work and have a separate head or director for such work. County 
vocational schools are also authorized. State aid equal in amount 
to the money raised locally is provided, not to exceed $10,000 for 
any one school. The work is placed in charge of a ‘‘deputy com- 
missioner in charge of vocational education, including agriculture.” 
A further act authorizes the State board of education to establish 
summer schools for training teachers of vocational subjects. 
The Connecticut act providing for the establishment of industrial 
schools (ch. 217) authorizes school boards to establish day, evening, 
continuation, or part-time classes. When the local authorities 
begin the work, the State pays half of the gross expenses of mainte- 
nance, less returns from sale of products, not to exceed $50 per 
pupil. In schools that may be organized by the State board of 
education, the net expenses will be paid by the State, and the towns 
selected for such schools must furnish buildings and equipment. The 
total amount authorized from the State is $125,000. By a later
-P-A-G-E-963
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913. 909 
act school boards in Connecticut are allowed to establish vocational 
guidance as part of the educational system and to employ vocation 
counsellors. 
Montana’s new school code makes it obligatory for school districts 
of 5,000 or more inhabitants to maintain at least one manual training 
school, to be taught by teachers holding special certificates from the 
State superintendent. In districts having 10,000 or more population 
special courses for direct vocational training must be established, to 
which pupils over 12 years of age who have completed the fifth grade 
may be admitted. Trustees are empowered to use money from 
the graded school fund for the maintenance of manual and indus- 
trial schools, and the State treasurer is directed to pay to districts 
maintaining such schools and to county high schools maintaining 
such courses $10 for each pupil in attendance six months. 
Agricultural education is provided for in a number of special acts. 
Nebraska, Vermont, Tennessee, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and 
Michigan authorize county farm demonstration work in one form or 
another. A Washington law creates a bureau of farm development 
to work in the counties. Wisconsin authorizes county ‘agricultural 
representatives for the purpose of aiding in agricultural development,” 
and will pay $1,000 annually to each county organizing such work. 
Kansas authorizes the county commissioners to establish a county 
demonstration farm. Colorado provides for the appointment by 
the county commissioners of a county agriculturist to study farm 
management and to give instruction to farmers. Missouri authorizes 
the county courts to appropriate funds for a county farm advisor to 
act with the State college of agriculture in encouraging agricultural 
development. Wisconsin carries the short-course idea into her high 
schools, with courses of not less than 16 weeks’ duration in not ex- 
ceeding 20 high schools. The State contributes $200 per course. 
Michigan and Wyoming add agriculture to the list of subjects in 
which teachers are to be examined. Florida appropriates $1,500 
annually for two years for the promotion of work in boys’ corn clubs 
and girls’ canning clubs. Iowa requires instruction in elementary 
agriculture in the public schools. In Texas one of the functions of 
the new farmers’ county public libraries to be established is to employ 
a librarian ‘‘whose duty it shall be to gather information pertaining 
to agriculture, horticulture, and kindred subjects,” and to make 
such information available to farmers. 
A large number of minor enactments for the encouragement of 
vocational education deserve mention. Nevada provided that the 
prescribed courses of study in the seventh and eighth grades should 
comprise ‘“‘business forms and elementary bookkeeping or some 
features of industrial work, and in the high-school grades provision 
for full commercial work and industrial work suitable for boys and 
 
-P-A-G-E-964
  910 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
girls.”” The Wisconsin Legislature of 1913 increased from $50,000 
to $100,000. the amount of State aid to free high schools maintaining 
courses in manual training, domestic economy, or agriculture; and 
granted an additional $100 to a district maintaining a graded school 
of the first or second class in which instruction is offered in agricul- 
ture and other industrial subjects. An amendment to the New 
York law empowers school boards to establish part-time and evening 
vocational courses; the length of term required for receiving State aid 
is reduced from 38 to 36 weeks. In Arizona the State is to pay a 
sum equal to one-half the amount provided by any school for the 
support of vocational training. Iowa gives the following aid to 
consolidated schools equipped with two or more rooms including 
industrial and vocational subjects in the course of study: Two-room 
building, $250 toward equipment and $200 annually; three-room 
building, $350 toward equipment and $500 annually; four or more 
rooms, $500 toward equipment and $750 annually. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION AND HEALTH TEACHING. 
Most of the current progress in school medical inspection and other 
phases of school hygiene is in the cities, and has come about inde- 
pendently of State legislation, except where special permissive laws 
are necessary for municipalities. In New York State, however, 
medical inspection has not only been made mandatory (ch. 627), 
but the mandatory section is made effective by the provision that 
the State commissioner of education may withhold public money 
from a district not complying with the law. The act further pro- 
vides that school boards shall employ physicians as medical inspec- 
tors and may employ nurses. Pupils are required to furnish health 
certificates on entering school each year. 
In Ohio a supplementary act includes teachers and janitors within 
the scope of examination by the school physician. The law provides 
that whenever a school child, teacher, or janitor is found to be ill or 
suffering from positive open pulmonary tuberculosis or other con- 
tagious disease ‘the school physician shall promptly send such child, 
teacher, or janitor home.” If a teacher or janitor is found to be 
suffering from tuberculosis at the open stage, or any other communi- 
cable disease, his or her employment shall be terminated upon expi- 
ration of the contract, “or, at the option of the board, suspended upon 
such terms as to salary as the board may deem just until the school 
physician shall have certified to a recovery from such disease.” 
New Hampshire’s medical inspection law is permissive (ch. 83). 
Any city, union, special, or town school district may adopt its pro- 
visions. School physicians must have had at least five years’ med- 
ical-experience. The law provides for medical examination every 
year of all pupils, teachers, janitors, and other employees, of school
-P-A-G-E-965
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913. 911 
buildings, grounds, and surroundings to such extent as the health 
of pupils may require. The teacher will refer the pupil who shows 
signs of ill health or disease to the parent or guardian for examina- 
tion by some regularly registered physician. If the child is not so 
examined, he must be examined by the school physician. Special 
tests in vision and hearing are prescribed; the school physician is to 
have every child in the public schools carefully tested and examined 
in the presence of the teacher at least once in every school year to 
ascertain whether he is suffering from defective sight or hearing— 
or from any other disability or defect tending to prevent his receiving the full benefit 
of his school work or requiring a modification of the school work in order to prevent 
injury to the child or to secure the best educational results. 
Several of the 1913 laws relate to transmission of communicable 
disease, especially tuberculosis. The common drinking cup in schools 
is barred by a legislative act in Minnesota, West Virginia, Nebraska, 
North Dakota, and Wisconsin. As an aid to the fight against tuber- 
culosis the New Hampshire State Board of Health is required to 
prepare bulletins on the cause and prevention of tuberculosis. The 
school board of every district in the State must furnish each teacher 
with sufficient copies for all the families in the district. An Ohio law 
provides for the appointment of one or more instructing and visiting 
nurses to visit any house or place in the county where there is a case 
of tuberculosis.’ In Wisconsin each county board of supervisors is 
authorized to appoint a graduate nurse to act as consulting expert 
on hygiene; one of her duties is to visit the schools to give instruction 
in the prevention of tuberculosis. 
Other health measures of direct interest to the schools were the 
New Jersey law authorizing large cities ‘‘to make annual appropria- 
tions to incorporated dental associations which conduct and maintain 
dental clinics for the free treatment of indigent children” (ch. 291), 
and the Massachusetts act authorizing cities and towns to furnish 
meals free or at cost to school children. The latter provides that— 
the city council of a city and the selectmen of a town may provide meals or lunches 
free or at such price, not exceeding the cost, as they may fix, for children attending 
its public schools, and cities and towns may appropriate money for this purpose. 
The act must be approved by a majority of the voters in a com- 
munity before going into operation. 
WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT. 
The social center agitation resulted in definite constructive legisla- 
tion in 1913. At least nine States passed laws recognizing explicitly 
the principle of wider evening use of school plants for social, intellec- 
tual, or recreational purposes. The laws of New York and New 
Jersey, which are practically identical, are typical of what is sought. 
 
-P-A-G-E-966
    912 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
These laws specify five distinct purposes, other than the customary 
ones, for any or all of which school property may be used: 
1. By persons assembling therein for the purpose of giving and receiving instruction 
in any branch of education, learning, or the arts. 
2. For public library purposes or as stations of public libraries. 
3. For holding social, civic, and recreational meetings and entertainments, and 
other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community. 
4. For meetings, entertainments, and occasions where admission fees are charged, 
when the proceeds thereof are to be expended for an educational or charitable purpose. 
5. For polling places for holding primaries and elections, for the registration of 
voters, and for holding political meetings. 
Idaho authorizes school trustees to permit the use of schoolhouses 
“for community purposes”; Massachusetts enumerates ‘educa- 
tional, recreational, social, civic, philanthropic, and similar purposes” 
as constituting permissible types of wider use activity; Indiana 
specifies that civic gatherings in schoolhouses must be nonpartisan. 
“The Kansas acts appear to be somewhat different in tone—one 
authorizes school boards to open schoolhouses for the use of religious, 
political, literary, scientific, mechanical, or agricultural societies, or 
societies for the suppression of crime; a second law adds night schools 
and improvement associations to the list. The California law is 
both explicit and comprehensive. It provides for the— 
free use of all public schoolhouses and property for the establishment of a civic center 
at each and every public schoolhouse in the State, and the maintenance, conduct, 
and management of the same. 
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
Centralization of educational control and supervision within the 
States continue to be marked, as for several years, by growing recog- 
nition of the dignity, power, and responsibility of the State superin- 
tendent of public instruction, or whatever the designation may be in 
the separate States. One indication of this is the upward trend of 
salaries for chief State officers. In Maine the salary has been raised 
from $2,500 to $4,000; Wisconsin will hereafter pay her superin- 
tendent $5,000, and the assistant State superintendent $3,000; Minne- 
sota, $4,500; West Virginia, $4,000; New Hampshire, not exceeding 
$4,000. In New Hampshire three deputy State superintendents are 
provided, at least one of whom shall be a woman. 
In Delaware the legislature created the office of State commissioner 
of education. Although the salary ($2,000) is hardly commensurate 
with the importance of the work to be done, the step is generally 
recognized as in the right direction. In Minnesota the “State super- 
intendent of education,” as he is now designated, is to have a term of 
four years after 1915 instead of two, as heretofore. Two new duties 
are imposed upon him—he is to prepare a uniform system of records 
 
-P-A-G-E-967
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913. 913 
for all public schools and establish a uniform system of accounting, 
and he is to pass on plans and specifications for buildings and con- 
demn unfit buildings (ch. 550). In Iowa the superintendent is to 
hold office by appointment from the governor instead of by popular 
election, and North Dakota’s law of March 11, 1913, provides for 
nonpartisan nomination and election of both State and county 
superintendents. 
HIGH SCHOOLS AND TEACHER-TRAINING. 
One most important development in secondary education that is 
viewed differently by different observers is teacher-training in high 
schools. Originating in New York State, the plan has developed most 
rapidly in the Middle West. Nebraska now has 153 high schools 
engaged in training teachers; Kansas has 160; and Arkansas, which 
recently entered the field, has 15. 
A recent Missouri law, designed to prepare teachers for elementary 
and rural schools, grants State aid to the amount of $750 annually to 
approved high schools and academies maintaining teacher-training 
courses. Notmore than $1,200 is to be distributed to any one county; 
$100, 000 has been appropriated to carry out the provisions of this act. 
The Kansas Legislature appropriated $125,000 annually for two years 
to high schools maintaining manual training courses. Minnesota in- 
creased the amount of State aid to teachers’ training departments 
from $750 to $1,000 by act of April 12, 19138. Even Wisconsin, with 
adequate county normal schools, has made provision for teachers’ 
training courses in free high schools in counties that are without 
county training schools. In the East, Vermont also provided during 
the year for training teachers in high schools for the benefit of rural 
schools. High schools and academies of the first class are authorized 
to establish such courses under the direction and approval of the State 
board of education. 
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS. 
Four States established pension systems during the legislative year 
1912-183—Massachusetts, California, North Dakota, and Maine. 
The Massachusetts system was adopted after a very careful survey 
of pension systems in the United States and abroad. Itis considered 
by some observers to be the best in respect to scientific insurance prin- 
ciples yet adopted. 
The law goes into effeet July 1, 1914. All teachers who enter the 
service for the first time after that date must become members of the 
Teachers’ Retirement Association. Teachers now in service may 
become members. Principals, supervisors, and superintendents are 
17726°—z p 1913—vor 1——_58

classified with teachers according to the law. As Boston has had a 
separate pension system for teachers since 1900, Boston teachers are 
not eligible to membership in the retirement association. Teachers 
in day industrial schools operating under the provisions of chapter 471, 
acts of 1911, are eligible for membership. 
The system provides that in the future a member of the retirement 
association shall contribute a small part of his salary for a term of 
years not exceeding 30. Upon retiring at the age of 60 or over, the 
teacher’s contributions are used to purchase an annuity. The State 
contributes a pension of equal amount. In case of death or with- 
drawal from service before the age of 60 refund is made of the teach- 
er’s entire contributions, with 3 per cent compound interest. For 
teachers now in service who have served at least 15 years in the public 
day schools of Massachusetts, 5 of which must immediately precede 
retirement, the State guarantees that the total retiring allowance shall 
be at least $300 a year upon retiring from service at the age of 60 or 
over. The law specifies that the rate of assessment shall lie between 
3 per cent and 7 per cent of a teacher’s salary, and the retirement 
board has established a 5 per cent rate for the year beginning July 1, 
1914. No assessment is to be less than $35 nor more than $100 a 
year. Payments will be deducted from the teacher’s compensation 
on pay days by the treasurers of the cities and towns. 
The management of the retirement system is vested in the teachers’ 
retirement board, consisting of seven members: The insurance com- 
missioner for the Commonwealth, the bank commissioner for the 
Commonwealth, the commissioner of education for the Common- 
wealth, three members of the retirement association, and one other 
person. 
In commenting on the expected working of the act, Mr. U. A. 
Prosser declares :* 
The amount necessary to yield an annuity of $500 at age 60 years will yield very 
nearly $750 at age 70 years. Hence it will be possible for teachers paying the maxi- 
mum assessments ($100 per annum) for a long term of years to retire on an allowance 
of $1,500 if they continue in service until age 70 years. , As an offset to the possible 
temptation to remain in service too long for the sake of building up a larger equity, 
provision is also made for retirement after age 60 years by the school committee. 
The California plan is of the contributory type. The State con- 
tributes as its share 5 per cent of the moneys collected every year 
under the inheritance or transfer tax law. Every teacher is assessed 
$1 a month, deduction being made at the time of salary payment. 
Thirty years of service is required, at least 15 of which must have 
been in the State, including the last 10 years of service immediately 
preceding retirement. Voluntary retirement will be allowed at the

end of the 30-year period; or, if physically or mentally incapacitated, 
a teacher may be compelled to retire by the board of education. An 
annual retirement salary of $500 will be paid. In case of bodily or 
mental infirmity after 15 years of service, a teacher may go into vol- 
untary or involuntary retirement, receiving as an annual stipend the 
fractional part of $500 represented by his years of service. 
In North Dakota the pension system is also of the contributory 
type. The deduction from salaries is 1 per cent (but not exceeding 
$20 a year) for the first 10 years of service, 2 per cent (but not exceed- 
ing $40 annually) until the teacher has had 25 years of experience. 
Contribution to the fund is obligatory for all teachers entering the 
service after January 1, 1914. Teachers are eligible to retirement after 
25 years of service, 18 of which, including the last 5, must have been in 
the State. To provide money for the fund the county treasurers are 
directed to set aside from the county tuition fund a sum equal to 10 
cents for each child of school age. The annuity equals one-fiftieth 
of the teacher’s average salary for the last five years, multiplied by 
the whole number of years of service as a teacher. An important 
provision is that teachers withdrawing at any time are entitled to 
receive one-half the total amount contributed. 
The Maine law provides a straight old-age pension, as follows: 
Any person of either sex who, on September 30, 1913, or thereafter, shall have 
reached the age of 60 years and who for 35 years shall have-been engaged in teaching 
as his principal occupation, and who shall have been employed as a teacher in the 
public schools, or in such other schools within this State as are supported wholly or 
at least three-fifths by State or town appropriation and are under public management 
and control, 20 years of which employment, including the 15 years immediately pre- 
ceding retirement, shall have been in this State, and who shall be retired by_his 
employer or shall voluntarily retire from active service after completion of the school 
year next preceding the 30th day of September, 1913, shall, on his formal application, 
receive from the State for the remainder of his life an annual pension of $250; Pro- 
vided, however, That after the 30th day of September, 1913, no such employment as 
teacher within this State shall be included in its provisions unless the teacher shall 
hold a State teachers’ certificate issued under the authority of the State superintendent 
of public schools. 
Any person of either sex who, on September 30, 1913, or thereafter, shall have 
reached the age of 60 years and who for 30 years shall have been engaged in teaching 
as his principal occupation, and who shall have in all other respects met the require- 
ments of section 1 of this act shall, on his formal application, receive from the State 
for the remainder of his life an annual pension of $200. 
Any person of either sex who, on September 30, 1913, or thereafter, shall have 
reached the age of 60 years, and who for 25 years shall have been engaged in teaching 
as his principal occupation, and who shall have in all other respects met the require- 
ments of section 1 of this act shall, on his formal application, receive from the State 
for the remainder of his life an annual pension of $150. 
In addition to the laws just cited, Indiana created a teacher retire- 
ment system for Terre Haute; Illinois provided for contribution 
from public moneys in cities of over 100,000 population; and Oregon 
 
-P-A-G-E-970
    916 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913. 
increased the public support for the teachers’ retirement fund by 
giving 3 per cent, instead of 1 per cent, of the district’s portion of the 
county school tax and all fees collected from teachers and other 
employees. 
BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. 
Ohio maintains its advanced position with regard to State con- 
trol and supervision of schoolhouse construction. Several amend- 
ments in 1913 to the general code were all of a nature to make an 
effective law still more effective by extending fireproof provisions 
practically to all structures of any size used for school purposes. 
A new Texas law regulates the lighting, heating, ventilating, 
sanitation, and fire protection of public-school buildings costing 
over $400. County superintendents are authorized to issue permits 
for such buildings, and no school board is allowed to build without 
first having obtained a permit. 
The special point of fire protection was covered here and there 
in a number of laws. Connecticut requires fire escapes for every 
schoolhouse of two or more stories in which the greatest elevation 
of any floor used by pupils is 10 or more feet above the ground. 
In Kansas the office of State fire marshal was created; his duties 
are to see that teachers have a fire drill at least once a month and 
that doors and exits are kept unlocked during school hours. Lessons 
on the causes and dangers of fires are to be given at least once in 
every quarter, the material for the instruction to be based on a bulle- 
tin prepared by the fire marshal’s office. A fine of $10 is provided 
for any board of education which fails to comply with the law. 
Oregon is another State where instruction in fire danger was added 
during 1913. Minnesota, Indiana, and Oregon all enacted laws 
during 1913 requiring fire drills at least once a month; in Oregon the 
law is made to apply’ to both public and private schools. A North 
Dakota act requires that all exits for schoolhouses having more than 
one room shall open outward and that fire escapes be attached to 
all school buildings having more than one story. 
TEXTBOOKS. 
Several phases of the schoolbook agitation are reflected in 1913 
legislation. Michigan is wary of the “book trust”; California is 
deep in the difficulties of State printing; several States are experi- 
menting with State adoption; while others are appointing commis- 
sions to find out what neighboring States have done. : 
The Michigan law (Act No. 315) compels firms selling school- 
books to file a bond with the State superintendent that they have 
not entered into “any understanding, agreement, or combination 
to control the prices or to restrict competition in the sale of school
-P-A-G-E-971
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION IN 1913, 917 
textbooks.” Other provisions are that the firms or individuals 
having schoolbooks to sell must file copies of all textbooks sold by 
them, with a sworn statement of the usual list price, the lowest 
wholesale price, and the lowest exchange price. The bond, which 
is to be not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000, is also to 
make certain that the book dealer will furnish any of the books 
listed in all schools in the State at the lowest prices contained in the 
statement and that he will maintain this price uniformly throughout 
the State; also that the book dealer or firm— 
will reduce such prices automatically in Michigan whenever reductions are made 
elsewhere in the United States; and that all textbooks offered for sale, adoption, 
or exchange shall be equal in quality to those deposited in the office of the State 
superintendent. : 
In case of violation of the provisions of the bond the State 
superintendent shall declare the bond forfeited, and if judgment 
is rendered against the dealer he will be barred from further con- 
tinuance of his business within the State of Michigan for a period 
of five years. Various restrictions are put on the retail dealer 
and the school district to prevent more than a slight increase over 
the wholesale list price in selling to school children. A somewhat 
unusual provision is that when a family moves from one school 
district to another within the State the treasurer of the district shall 
purchase, at a fair price, the textbooks in actual use by the children” 
of the family. The price is to be based on the condition of the 
books, and these books may be resold, when necessary, to other 
pupils moving into the district. 
California’s attempt to distribute State textbooks free, in accord 
with the constitutional provision, was signalized by an appropriation 
of $500,000 to pay for this service. By chapter 364 (June 13) 
school boards and other officers empowered to designate textbooks 
are ordered to give preference to books written, compiled, printed, 
and published in the State. 
The new Montana code provides for State adoption. The governor 
is empowered to appoint a State textbook commission of seven 
members. This commission is to meet on the third Monday in July, 
1917, and every second year thereafter, to consider changes in text- 
books, receive proposals, etc. Changes are not to be made in the 
textbooks of more than three subjects at any one meeting. For the 
enforcement of State adoption, it is made a misdemeanor to use 
books other than those selected by the commission, and county 
superintendents are obliged to require school boards to report whether 
the adopted books were used. 
In Georgia and North Carolina commissions have been appointed 
to investigate schoolbook conditions. The North Carolina com- 
mission was empowered to investigate and report to the legislature  
-P-A-G-E-972
    918 EDUCATION REPORT, 1913, 
on the advisability of the State publishing schoolbooks and furnishing 
them to citizens at cost. In New York the commissioner of efficiency 
and economy was authorized to investigate and gather statistics 
and make report to the legislature upon the subject of the cost 
of providing free textbooks ‘‘in all the schools within the State 
supported by the State and its several subdivisions.’ Laws extend- 
ing the free textbook principles were enacted in Missouri, Nevada, 
North Dakota, and Oregon. Rhode Island passed a law allowing 
textbooks to become the property of a pupil who has completed the 
use of them in school, subject to rules and regulations prescribed 
by the school committee; and Indiana provides for uniform textbooks 
in the high schools of the State, the State board of education consti- 
tuting itself a commission to select such books. 
SCHOOL FRATERNITIES. 
Secret societies were legislated out of existence in a number of States 
in 1913. The Montana code contains several specific provisions 
prohibiting them. Michigan made the already existing act more 
strict by striking out the limit of time in which notice shall be given 
to offending pupils; the law leaves to the discretion of the school 
boards the steps taken to abolish school societies. 
@ The Colorado law prohibiting “‘secret fraternities, sororities, or 
societies, in the public schools,” recites— 
That from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any pupil, regis- 
tered as such, and attending any high school, district, primary, or graded school which 
is partially or wholly maintained by public funds, to join or become a member of any 
secret fraternity, sorority, or society wholly or partially formed from the membership 
of pupils attending any such schools, or to belong to or take part in the organization 
or formation of any fraternity, sorority, or society, except such societies or associations 
as shall be sanctioned by the boards of directors of the school districts wherein such 
schools are maintained. 
It is hereby declared to be unlawful for any person to cause, solicit, induce, or 
encourage any pupil or pupils of such schools to join any such fraternity, sorority, 
society, or association mentioned in section 1 hereof, or to solicit any such pupil or 
pupils to attend any meeting for the purpose of what is commonly known as ‘‘rushing,”’ 
or to induce or solicit any such pupil or pupils to join any fraternity, sorority, society, 
‘or organization organized outside of said school, except such societies or associations 
as shall have been first sanctioned by the board of directors of the school district 
wherein such school is maintained. 
Pupils violating the provisions of the law are declared to be delin- 
quents and may be proceeded against as such; and anyone advising 
or encouraging such violation will be dealt with as contributors to 
the delinquency of children. 
Maine and Oklahoma also passed lews prohibiting secret societies in 
the public schools.

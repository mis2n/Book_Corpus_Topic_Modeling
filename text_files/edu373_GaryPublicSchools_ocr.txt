INTRODUCTION 
Tue Gary PLAN » /_ 
In the last few years both laymen and professional 
educators have engaged in a lively controversy as to the 
merits and defects, advantages and disadvantages of 
what has come to be called the Gary idea or the Gary 
plan. The rapidly increasing literature bearing on the 
subject is, however, deficient in details and too often 
partisan in tone. The present study was undertaken 
by the General Education Board at the request of the 
Gary school authorities for the purpose of presenting an 
accurate and comprehensive account of the Gary schools 
in their significant aspects. 
In the several volumes in which the main features of 
the Gary schools are separately considered, the reader 
will observe that, after presenting facts, each of the 
authors discusses or—in technical phrase—attempts to 
evaluate the Gary plan from the angle of his particular 
interest. Facts were gathered in a patient, painstaking, 
and objective fashion; and those who want facts, and 
facts only, will, it is believed, find them in the descriptive 
and statistical portions of the respective studies. But 
the successive volumes will discuss principles, as well as

state facts. That is, the authors will not only describe 
the Gary schools in the frankest manner, as they found 
them, but they will also endeavor to interpret them in the 
light of the large educational movement of which they 
are part. An educational conception may be sound or 
unsound; any particular effort to embody an educa- 
tional conception may be adequate or inadequate, effec- 
tive or ineffective. The public is interested in knowing 
whether the Gary schools as now conducted are efficient 
or inefficient; the public is also interested in knowing 
whether the plan as such is sound or unsound. The 
present study tries to do justice to both points. 
What is the Gary plan? 
Perhaps, in the first instance, the essential features of 
the Gary plan can be made clear, if, instead of trying to 
tell what the Gary plan is, we tell what it is not. Ex- 
cept for its recent origin and the unusual situation as 
respects its foreign population, Gary resembles many 
other industrial centers that are to be found throughout 
the country. Now, had Gary provided itself with the 
type of school commonly found in other small industrial 
American towns, we should find there half a dozen or 
more square brick “soap-box” buildings, each accom- 
modating a dozen classes pursuing the usual book studies, 
a playground, with little or no equipment, perhaps a 
basement room for manual training, a laboratory, and a 
cooking room for the girls. Had Gary played safe, this 
is the sort of school and school equipment that it would 
now possess. Provided with this conventional school  
-P-A-G-E-9
  INTRODUCTION ix 
system, the town would have led a conventional school 
life—quiet, unoffending, and negatively happy—doing 
as many others do, doing it about as well as they do it 
and satisfied to do just that. 
As contrasted with education of this meager type, the 
Gary plan is distinguished by two features, intimately 
connected with each other: ‘ 
First—the enrichment and diversification of the 4. 
curriculum; 
Second—the administrative device that, for want ofa, _ 
better name, will be tentatively termed the duplicate 
school organization. 
These two features must first be considered in general 
terms, if the reader is to understand the detailed descrip- 
tion and discussion. 
As to the curriculum and school activities. While 
the practice of education has in large part continued 
to follow traditional paths, the progressive literature of 
the subject has abounded in constructive suggestions 
of far-reaching practical significance. Social, political, 
and industrial changes have forced upon the school 
responsibilities formerly laid upon the home. Once the 
school had mainly to teach the elements of knowledge; 
now the school is charged with the physical, mental, and 
social training of the child. To meet these needs a 
changed and enriched curriculum, including community 
activitiés, facilities for ¥ecreation, shop work, and ‘house- 
hold arts, has béen urged_on the contént side’ of school 
work; the transformation of school aims and discipline
-P-A-G-E-10
  x INTRODUCTION 
on the basis of modern psychology, ethics, and social 
philosophy has been for similar reasons recommended on 
the side of attitude and method. 
These things have been in the air. Every one of them 
has been tried and is being practised in some form or 
other, somewhere or other. In probably every large 
city in the country efforts have been made, especially in 
the more recent school plants, to develop some of the 
features above mentioned. There has been a distinct, 
unmistakable, and general. trend toward making the 
school a place where children “live” as well as “learn.” 
This movement did not originate at Gary; nor is Gary its 
only evidence. It is none the less true that perhaps no- 
where else have the schools so deliberately and explicitly 
avowed this modern policy. The Gary schools are offi- 
cially described as “work, study, and play” schools— 
schools, that is, that try to respond adequately to a many- 
sided responsibility; how far and with what success, the 
successive reports of the Gary survey will show. 
It must not, however, be supposed that the enriched 
curriculum was applied in its present form at the out- 
set or that it is equally well developed in all the Gary 
schools. Far from it. There has been a distinct and 
uneven process of development at Gary; sometimes, as 
subsequent chapters will show, such rapid and unstable 
development that our account may in certain respects 
be obsolete before it is printed. When the Emerson 
school was opened in 1909, the equipment in laboratories, 
shops, and museums, while doubtless superior to what 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  INTRODUCTION xi 
was offered by other towns of the Gary type, could have 
been matched by what was to be found in many of the 
better favored larger towns and cities at the same period. 
The gymnasium, for example, was not more than one 
third its present size; the industrial work was not un- 
precedented in kind or extent; the boys had woodwork, /! 
the girls cooking and sewing. But progress was vapid 
painting and printing were added in 1911; the foundry, 
forge, and machine shop in 1913. The opportunities 
for girls were enlarged by the addition of the cafeteria in 
1913. The auditorium reached its present extended use 
as recently as the school year 1913-14. The Froebel 
school, first occupied in the fall of 1912, started with 
facilities similar to those previously introduced piecemeal 
into the Emerson. 
These facilities, covering in their development a period 
of years, represent the effort to create an elementary 
school more nearly adequate to the needs of modern 
urban life. The curriculum is enriched by various ac- 
tivities in the fields of industry, science, and recreation. 
Questions as to the efficiency with which these varied 
activities have been administered will be discussed by 
the various contributors to the present study. Mean- 
while, it is perhaps only fair to point out that the modern 
movement calls not only for additions to, but elimina- 
tions from, the curriculum and for a critical attitude 
toward the products of classroom teaching. How far, on 
the academic side, the Gary schools reflect this aspect 
of the modern movement will also presently appear.
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii INTRODUCTION 
The administrative device—the “duplicate” organiza- 
the Gary plan—stands on a somewhat different footing, 
as the following considerations make plain. 
Once more, Mr. Wirt was not the inventor of the in- 
tensive use of school buildings, though he was among the 
first—if not the very first—to perceive the purely educa- 
tional advantage to which the situation could be turned. 
The rapidity with which American cities have grown has 
created a difficult problem for school administrators— 
the problem of providing space and instruction for chil- 
dren who increase in number faster than buildings are 
constructed. The problem has been handled in various 
ways. In one place, the regular school day has been 
shortened and two different sets of children attending at 
different hours have been taught daily in one building 
and by one group of teachers. Elsewhere, as in certain 
high schools, a complete double session has been con- 
ducted. The use of one set of schoolrooms for more than 
one set of children each day did not therefore originate 
at Gary. 
Another point needs to be considered before we discuss 
the so-called duplicate feature of the Gary plan. In 
American colleges, subjects have commonly been taught 
by specialists, not by class teachers. The work is “de- 
partmentalized”—to use the technical term. There is 
a teacher of Latin, a teacher of mathematics, a teacher 
of physics, who together instruct every class—not a 
separate teacher of each class in all subjects. Latterly,
-P-A-G-E-13
  INTRODUCTION xiii 
departmentalization has spread from the college into 
the high school, until nowadays well organized high 
schools and the upper grades of elementary schools are 
quite generally “departmentalized,” i.e., organized with 
special teachers for the several subjects, rather than 
with one teacher for each grade. : 
Out of these two elements, Gary has evolved an admin- 
istrative device, the so-called duplicate school, which, 
from the standpoint of its present educational signifi- 
cance, does indeed represent a definite innovation. 
For the sake of clearness, it will be well to explain the 
theory of the duplicate school by a simplified imaginary 
example: 
Let us suppose that elementary school facilities have 
to be provided for, say, 1,600 children. If each class is 
to contain a maximum of 40 children, a schoolhouse of 
40 rooms would formerly have been built, with perhaps 
a few additional rooms, little used, for special activities; 
except during the recess (12 to 1:30) each recitation 
room would be in practically continuous use in the old- 
line subjects from 9 to 3:30, when school is adjourned till 
next morning. A school plant of this kind may be 
represented by Figure I, each square representing a 
schoolroom. 
The “duplicate” school proposes a different solution. 
Instead of providing 40 classrooms for 40 classes, it 
requires 20 classrooms, capable of holding 800 children; 
and further, playgrounds, laboratories, shops, gardens, 
gymnasium, and auditorium, also capable of holding
-P-A-G-E-14
  xiv INTRODUCTION 
800 children. If, now, 800 children use the classrooms 
while 800 are using the other facilities, morning and after- 
noon, the entire plant accommodates 1,600 pupils 
throughout the school day; and the curriculum is greatly 
enriched, since, without taking away anything from their 
classroom work, they are getting other branches also. A 
school thus equipped and organized may be represented

40 rooms for cn classes, of 40 children each, i. e., facilities for the academic instruc. 
tion of 1,600 children. A school yard and an extra room or two, little used, for special activities, are also usually found. ‘

care of 4o children each (800 children), and B represents 
special facilities taking care of 800 children. As A 
and B are in simultaneous operation, 1,600 children are 
cared for. 
This method of visualizing the “duplicate” school 
serves to correct a common misconception. The plan 
aims to intensify the use of schoolrooms; yet it would be
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION xv 
incorrect to say that 20 classrooms, instead of 40, 
as under the old plan, accommodate 1,600 children. 
For while the number of classrooms has been reduced 
from 40 to 20, special facilities of equal capacity have 
been added in the form of auditorium, shops, play- 
ground, etc. The 20 classrooms apparently saved

have been replaced by special-facilities of one kind or 
another. The so-called duplicate organization and 
the longer school day make it possible to give larger 
facilities to twice as many children as the classrooms alone 
would accommodate. The duplicate school, as devel- 
oped at Gary, is not therefore a device to relieve conges- 
tion or to reduce expense, but the natural result of 
efforts to provide a richer school life for all children.

xvi INTRODUCTION 
The enriched curriculum and the duplicate organ- 
ization support each other. The social situation re- 
quires a scheme of education fairly adequate to the 
entire scope of the child’s activities and possibilities; 
this cannot be achieved without a longer school day and 
a more varied school equipment. The duplicate school 
endeavors to give the longer day, the richer curriculum, 
and the more varied activities with the lowest possible 
investment in, and the most intensive use of, the school 
plant. The so-called duplicate school is thus a single 
school with two different types of facilities in more or less 
constant and simultaneous operation, morning and 
afternoon. 
Such is the Gary plan in conception. What about the 
execution? Is it realized at Gary? Does it work? 
What is involved as respects space, investment, etc., 
when ordinary classrooms are replaced by shops, play- 
grounds, and laboratories? Can a given equipment in 
the way of auditorium, shops, etc., handle precisely 
the same number of children accommodated in the class- 
rooms without doing violence to their educational needs 
on the one hand, and without waste through temporary 
disuse of the special facilities, on the other? To what 
extent has Gary modified or reorganized on modern lines 
the treatment of the common classroom subjects? How 
efficient is instruction in the usual academic studies as 
well as in the newer or so-called modern subjects and 
activities? Is the plan economical in the sense that 
equal educational advantages cannot be procured by
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION xvii 
any other scheme except at greater cost? These and 
other questions as to the execution of the Gary plan are, 
as far as data were obtainable, discussed in the separate 
volumes making up the present survey. 
The concrete questions above mentioned do not, how- 
ever, exhaust the educational values of a given school 
situation. From every school system there come im- 
ponderable products, bad as well as good. Aside from 
all else, many observers of the Gary schools report one 
such imponderable in the form of a spiritual something 
which can hardly be included in a study of administra- 
tion and eludes the testing of classroom work. These 
observers have no way of knowing whether Gary school 
costs are high or low; whether the pupils spell and add as 
well as children do elsewhere; but, however these things 
may be, they usually describe the pupils as characterized 
by self-possession, resourcefulness, and happiness to an 
unusual degree. While different schools and indeed 
different parts of the same school vary in this respect, 
the members of the survey staff agree that, on the whole, 
there is a basis of fact for these observations. Gary is 
thus something more than a school organization charac- 
terized by the two main features above discussed. 
The reason is not far to seek. Innovation is stimu- 
lating, just as conformity is deadening. Experiment 
is in this sense a thing wholesome in itself.. Of course 
it must be held to strict accountability for results; and 
this study is the work of persons who, convinced of the 
necessity of educational progress, are at the same time
-P-A-G-E-18
xviii INTRODUCTION 
solicitous that the outcome be carefully observed. 
The fact that customary school procedure does not rest 
upon a scientific basis, does not willingly submit itself 
to thorough scrutiny, is no reason for exempting educa- 
tional innovations from strict accountability. The very 
reverse is indeed true; for otherwise innovation may im- 
peril or sacrifice essential educational values, without 
actually knowing whether or not it has achieved definite 
values of its own. Faith in a new program does not 
absolve the reformer from a watchful and critical atti- 
tude toward results. Moreover, if the innovator for- 
mulates his purposes in definite terms and measures his 
results in the light of his professed aims, the conservative 
cannot permanently escape the same process. Gary, like 
all other educational experiments, must be held account- 
able in this fashion. Subject however to such ac- 
countability, the breaking of the conventional school 
framework, the introduction of new subject matter or 
equipment, even administrative reorganization, at Gary as 
elsewhere, tend to favor a fresher, more vigorous interest 
and spirit. Defects will in the following pages be pointed 
out in the Gary schools—defects of organization, of ad- 
ministration, of instruction. But there is for the reasons 
just suggested something in the Gary schools over and 
above the Gary plan. Problems abound, as in every 
living and developing situation. But the problems 
are the problems of life, and, as such, are in the long 
run perhaps more hopeful than the relatively smooth 
functioning of a stationary school system. Thus, not-

withstanding the defects and shortcomings which this 
study will candidly point out, the experiment at Gary 
rightly observed and interpreted is both interesting and 
stimulating.

SCIENCE TEACHING 
I. SCIENCE TEACHING AS A PART OF A 
MODERN CURRICULUM 
Tes is fairly universal assent to the opinion 
that since science enters so largely into modern 
thought, experience, and action, it should be 
included in any curriculum which deliberately and ade- 
quately relates to the world in which we live. A length- 
ened school day, better equipment, and better use of the 
school’s environment provide increased opportunity for 
studies in science. In connection with science and shop 
work, the mere cultivation of dexterity and exercise of 
the senses have an undeniable value, for it is worth a 
pupil’s while to be “handy” and certainly worth his while 
to be observant. Thus, simply as training for the senses, 
a case can be made out for work in science. In order, 
however, to justify the elaborateness of the outfit which 
Gary has installed and the seriousness with which the 
subject is there viewed, more than sense training must be 
obtained. It is, for intellectual reasons, a sound philos- 
ophy of education which insists that pupils do things 
rather than read about them or see them done. But 
mere doing of concrete tasks—whether tasks assigned in 
3  
-P-A-G-E-24
4 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the laboratory manual or tasks from everyday life—does 
not in itself prolong the exercise into the intellectual 
region. To realize large educational value, the exercise 
needs to be carried far enough to bring out explicitly 
the intellectual side of processes. The pupil must think 
consecutively about the factors which he is manipulating; 
he must think about the causal and purposeful relations 
involved in the concrete processes that he is carrying out. 
He must eventually be able to express results in general- 
ized form, and to deal with laws and relationships. An 
educational development of this kind does not take place 
spontaneously, as a result of the pupil’s working with ma- 
terials such as animals, plants, metals, a printing press, a 
dynamo, or a camera. In these appealing tools and ob- 
jects, innumerable intellectual values and factors are 
involved—the origin and history of culture, the proper- 
ties of materials, the application of laws and principles 
to the work of men and to their organization of ideas. 
Only a skillful instructor, pursuing a well thought out and 
well wrought plan, requiring interested and protracted 
effort on the pupil’s part, can teach science so as to ob- 
tain these values from it. Unless it is so taught science 
teaching will not meet expectations or realize its possi- 
bilities. 
Great hopes attended the introduction of science stud- 
ies into education—hopes that to a considerable extent 
have thus far been disappointed. If we assume—as we 
do—that this disappointment does not really imply 
simply a mistaken enthusiasm on the part of those who
-P-A-G-E-25
  SCIENCE TEACHING 5 
still believe in the importance of science in educational 
development, several reasons may be assigned for it, 
viz., the lack of sufficient school time, the lack of teachers 
trained to know the science of common things, and the 
employment of unsound methods. It is probable that 
these factors go far to account for the unsatisfactory 
outcome of the early efforts to teach science in the ele- 
mentary and the high schools. The subjects usually 
got inadequate recognition in the school schedule; often 
the teachers had not been properly trained; finally, the 
method of presentation, being excessively formal and 
abstract, did not lead to consideration of the things 
about which pupils wish and need to know.
-P-A-G-E-26
Il. SCIENCE TEACHING IN THE GARY 
SCHOOLS 
(A) GENERAL PLAN 
HE Gary school system is composed of nine 
schools. Two of these schools—the Froebel and 
the Emerson—are large and commodious modern 
school buildings, the former accommodating 2,087 pupils, 
the latter, of about equal capacity, having an enrollment 
of 967, both, in point of equipment, adequate to the car- 
trying out of the Gary plan described in the introduction 
to this volume; the Jefferson school, with 1,011 pupils, is 
a remodeled building of conventional type; the Beveridge 
and Glen Park schools, with 683 and 315 pupils respec- 
tively, are both inferior to the Jefferson in facilities. The 
remaining schools are merely temporary structures. 
The Froebel and Emerson schools include complete ele- 
mentary and high school courses; the other schools are 
elementary schools, the Jefferson alone comprising all of 
the eight elementary grades. 
All the schools offer instruction in nature study and 
gardening in the primary grades. The Emerson and 
Froebel schools offer, in addition, botany, zoology, phys- 
ics, and chemistry. 
As far as possible the teaching is departmentalized; 
that is, the nature study of the primary grades is in charge 
6
-P-A-G-E-27
  
SCIENCE TEACHING IN GARY SCHOOLS 7 
of teachers chosen for that work, while the science work 
of the upper grades and that of the two high schools is 
in the hands of special teachers in the different subjects. 
According to the plan of organization at the time of the 
survey, the science work of all the Gary schools was organ- 
ized as a department of science with the chemistry teacher 
of the Emerson school as head. In studying the organiza- 
tion, administration, supervision and teaching of science, 
it was not possible to discover or secure a comprehensive 
statement of purposes of the work, nor an outline of the 
plan of the work for the entire system. There were in- 
deed few indications of general or unified policy. No 
plan or outline of work in the several subjects had been 
made to guide the teachers. It was rather the intention 
of the authorities to leave the several schools and the 
several teachers in any one school large freedom to 
determine their own purposes and to work out their own 
courses of instruction. 
(B) TIME ALLOTMENT 
The amount of time actually used in teaching science 
in the Gary schools is not easily determined, since the 
schools vary considerably and within each school the 
teacher is free to depart from the schedule. Since science 
is often taught together with English or shop work, etc., 
it is not possible to say exactly how much of the time 
belongs to science. This fact is not in itself necessarily 
a fault; but it renders any estimate made of the time 
used little more than a guess. Careful study of the  
-P-A-G-E-28
  8 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
school program and conference with the individual 
teachers of science lead to the following estimate of the 
number of hours of instruction in science received by 
the pupils in the different grades:

This table may be understood as meaning that in pass- 
ing through the eight grades of the elementary schools 
Gary children may devote approximately 550 hours to 
the study of science. The number of hours undoubt- 
edly varies considerably from grade to grade and from 
school to school. 
On this basis science is exceeded by six subjects and 
exceeds six in the average amounts of time given to itt 
Those which it exceeds are German, music, geography, 
writing, spelling, and history. It will be noted that the 
time allowance for science falls off sharply in grades 4 
and 5; this is accounted for by the increased time as-

1Language includes the grammar of the seventh and eighth grades. 
2Unfortunately we are unable to separate drawing from manual training or shop work. In the first two grades the allotted time is divided about equally. In the other grades, 
approximately one-third goes to drawing, including both freehand and mechanical, and 
two-thirds to shop work. 
‘The time allotment to music relates to regular music teaching, and does not include such parts of “auditorium” time as may be given to it. 
‘German is taught in Emerson and Jefferson only.

14 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
signed to drawing, manual training, and household studies 
in those grades. 
The figures above given differ considerably from the 
figures that appear on the school schedules. For in- 
stance, the Jefferson school schedule assigns to all classes 
either 50 or 100 hours of science work; the Emerson 
schedule assigns 200 hours to nature work in the first, 
second, and third grades; at the Froebel, the schedule 
runs from 100 to 400 hours. The differences in question 
doubtless arise in part from the fact that in certain grades 
time scheduled for science is employed for other purposes. 
It seems unlikely that all the time officially allotted to 
science was used for that subject in any of the schools. 
It also seems that the total allotted time represents, in 
the absence of any coherent plan of work, an excessive 
estimate of the time actually devoted to the work. 
The Emerson program, taken as a whole, schedules 
2733% hours possible for science for 11 classses; the 
Froebel, 5000 hours for 37 classes. Of the total Emer- 
son amount, rooo are listed for “helpers”; of the 
Froebel amount, 1900. “Helpers” are found mainly 
in classes devoted to science, sewing, cooking, and in the 
shops. The helper is a young pupil—in science usually 
belonging to the third, fourth, or fifth grade—who works 
side by side with older pupils on the theory that the 
younger pupil will profit by association and codperation 
with the older. The educational outcome of the arrange- 
ment will be discussed later.
-P-A-G-E-37
Ill. DAILY TEACHING SCHEDULES AND 
COMPOSITION OF CLASSES 
INCE the daily program of the teachers whose 
S work is confined entirely to the primary grades is 
usually less complicated than that of the teachers 
of special sciences, the programs for these two groups 
of teachers are presented separately on pages 16-17. 
Also, although all teachers whose programs are here 
shown by special subjects teach both high school and 
grade classes, some of the teachers were unable to sup- 
ply the desired data for all the terms of the school year 
and it must be borne in mind that these schedules are in- 
complete in a few instances. 
In the Gary schools each class is assigned a number 
which bears no relation to the’ grading of the class. 
When, as appears in the column “Class Number,” a 
class is said to consist of “12-11,” an inspection of the 
next column shows that the grades of classes 12 and 11 
are 6 and 5 respectively. 
An inspection of the column ‘Scheduled Grade” shows 
that high school teachers who teach in the elementary 
school may have classes at any level in the grades. It 
is not intended that these teachers should teach pupils in 
primary grades except when there are too many primary

classes for the primary nature study teacher and when 
vacant periods of other teachers may be temporarily 
occupied by teaching primary pupils.

of work in nature study in the different schools, 
it is not possible to present all in a single state- 
ment. Therefore, a rather full statement is made for 
one school, following which the distinctive features of the 
other schools will be described. Gem there is wide variation between the kinds 
A. THE JEFFERSON SCHOOL 
A special room is provided for the work of science 
classes. It has been made by use of a partition and other 
structural changes in a room which was formerly an ordi- 
nary classroom. The rear portion of the room with south 
exposure has been separated for use as a plant growing 
house, animal house, and work place for the children for 
any work which requires the use of materials or processes 
which could not easily be handled in the main room. 
This room? is approximately 27 feet long and 83 feet 
wide; that is, the room is as long as the main schoolroom 
is wide and is 8 feet 8inches deep. This provides a grow- 
  
‘Intermediate and upper grade work in the Jefferson school is included 
under this topic together with primary work.

ing house with three south windows, and one large west 
window. A long work bench runs along the south 
windows, and under this bench are earthen pots, animal 
cages, and other materials for class use. In the middle 
north wall are a wash basin and sink, provided with hot 
and cold water. Animal cages are placed about the . 
room. At the time of inspection there were four cages 
with live animals, and also a number of empty cages. 
On one wall are racks for the hoes, rakes, sprayer, and 
other garden tools. 
The partition separating the nature study room from 
the main seating room is made of narrow wooden strips 
and glass so that there is the minimum of interference 
with the lighting of the room in which the children sit 
when at their desks. There is an additional advantage 
in that the children may easily look through this parti- 
tion into the work room, and the teacher may easily see

any pupils who are working in this room while she is with 
a class in the main room. The walls of the nature study 
room also have strong braces fastened to the window 
cases for the support of large flower pots in which there 
were specially fine plants, such as ferns and araucarian 
pines.? 
The animal cages contained a guinea pig, a turtle, some 
rabbits and several white rats, some of which had young, 
which were of great interest to the children. The grow- 
ing boxes contained small plants such as geraniums, 
chrysanthemums, wandering jew, which the pupils had 
started from slips, and which were to be used in the gar- 
den in the spring. There is a large garden visible from 
the windows of the work room immediately to the south 
of the school building. 
The larger part of the room, while occupied by seats 
for the class, has additional features which are of value 
for nature study. -Above the blackboard, molding runs 
around three sides of the room at such a height that 
maps, charts, pictures, drawings, mounted plant speci- 
mens and other children’s handwork, collections of 
birds’ nests, twigs of different kinds of trees, etc., may be 
placed in plain view of all children in the room. Much 
material of these kinds was kept constantly before the 
children; it was partially changed from time to time, as 
was evident on later visits. In the front of the room is a 
sand table on rollers, which can be easily moved from 
place to place.

NATURE STUDY AND GARDEN WORK — 2: 
B, BEVERIDGE SCHOOL 
The nature study room in the Beveridge school is on 
the second floor of an old building, the first floor of which 
is used as the school auditorium. The room is provided 
with a wardrobe, a case for books, and a small corner 
room in which nature materials can be stored. There 
was a sand table on rollers, this table having been filled 
with soil and planted with growing plants. A long 
bench, 14 feet by 2 feet, had boxes upon it in which were 
seedlings that were being prepared for future garden 
work, toward which most of the nature study work of the 
school was directed. These boxes included seedlings 
of pansies, coreopsis, tomatoes, and cabbage. On one 
of the walls of the room was a wide cork wall board on 
which were displayed children’s drawings of nature work 
and nature materials that were brought in by the teacher. 
A small aquarium with sunfish, and a small insect cage 
containing a Cecropia moth, three fern baskets hanging 
from the ceiling, a rabbit in the corner room, willows, dog- 
wood, and twigs of other plants constituted the live ma- 
terial for study in the room. In a vacant lot at the 
side of the school building a garden space! is provided, 
this space being approximately thirty feet wide and 
eighty feet long. 
C. THE EMERSON AND FROEBEL SCHOOLS i 
These schools include both elementary and high 
schools, and most of the nature or science work in the

grades is done by the teachers who teach the sciences in 
the high schools. It is necessary, therefore, to present 
in this connection part of the grade work under the head- 
ing of nature study in the primary grades, and elsewhere 
to present part of the grade work under the headings of 
the special sciences. 
These schools have abundant equipment in material 
for experimentation, in laboratory and shop space, in 
gardens, and in provision for keeping living plants and 
animals in and near the school rooms. The Emerson 
school possesses an extensive set of poultry houses, and 
a zoo in which are many kinds of native wild animals. 
The Froebel gardens include several acres,’ and while the 
Emerson gardens are very much smaller, the Emerson 
school is provided with very much more equipment for 
animal studies than the Froebel school. The Emerson 
poultry houses? contain several kinds of domesticated 
fowls and pigeons, and the zoo contains wild ducks of 
several kinds, pheasants, foxes, raccoons, prairie dogs, 
opossums, skunks, coyotes, a wolf, a porcupine, and 
other animals. Both schools provide nesting boxes for 
wild birds, and both are located adjacent to extensive 
areas of undeveloped sandy land which are available for 
school use. : 
The details of equipment will appear more clearly in 
the later descriptions of types of work and in illustrations 
appearing therewith.

D. OTHER SCHOOLS 
The equipment in other schools—e. g., Glen Park and 
West Gary—was meager. At one time or another, how- 
ever, these schools utilize for instructional purposes the 
striking features of the region in which they are located.1

V.. STAFF AND INSTRUCTION IN NATURE 
STUDY 
r “HE teachers of nature study in the Jefferson 
and Beveridge schools were graduates of Cornell 
University. At the Emerson and Froebel the 
work was also under the guidance of college trained 
teachers. The kindergarten and classroom teachers in the 
earliest grades give a small amount of the nature work. 
Of general supervision there is almost none. That 
is, no member of the supervisory staff, not even the in- 
structor in the Emerson school previously mentioned, 
coéperates with teachers in any regular way in planning 
their nature study work or in inspecting their classes 
from time to time. The teachers in the various schools 
meet but rarely to discuss their work. Within the sev- 
eral schools, the principals take a varying interest in the 
classroom work. At the Jefferson the principal’s super- 
vision was general, but helpful; elsewhere, it amounted 
to little. There was in consequence no unity of effort, 
as respects purpose, content, or method. Each teacher 
followed her own judgment and too frequently lived 
“from one day to the next.” There was not only no 
course of study such as might afford general guidance to 
all who dealt with the subject—no complete course of 
24
-P-A-G-E-53
  INSTRUCTION IN NATURE STUDY 25 
study was procurable within any single school. Nor 
had any teacher kept a systematic record or diary of the 
subjects which had been taken up. On the walls and in 
the rooms was the only concrete evidence of the activities 
pursued, other than those which might be observed in 
operation at the times of visits. These were at times 
interesting and creditable. For example, the Jefferson 
school showed that the pupils in the preceding autumn 
had collected the seeds of the wild plants of the region 
and deserted birds’ nests; they had mounted pictures 
of birds and other animals and made drawings of the 
landscape. 
It is in consequence impossible to describe in general 
terms the nature study work of the Gary schools. At 
best, one can give examples of what was going on at the 
time of the survey. It may be assumed that similar 
activities of more or less unsystematic character were in 
progress at other times. At the Jefferson school, though 
garden work always occupies part of the time of grades 
doing nature study and though observational study 
of such objects as the pussy willow appears from time to 
time, for the most part nature study centered about geog- 
raphy. For example, a third grade class was engaged in 
studying the causes of winds. The recitation was typical 
of many observed. After a few general questions, the 
class was set to reading silently a text on the subject. 
After fifteen minutes, the same text was read orally, the 
teacher questioning the children on its meaning as they 
proceeded. From time to time the teacher endeavored  
-P-A-G-E-54
26 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
to utilize the personal experience of the children in the 
matter of climate. Thus climatic differences between 
Florida and Colorado, between seashore and mountains, 
were made vivid. In connection with winds a home ex- 
periment on the action of heated air was suggested, though 
unfortunately “cold fairies” were also mentioned by the 
teacher as possible causes. Finally, a spelling lesson was 
made of the unusual words occurring in the text read. 
In much the same fashion, a seventh grade class went 
through a lesson on the rotation of the earth. Though 
the reading matter assigned was difficult, the questioning 
was excellently carried out. 
At the Beveridge school, the teacher, who had only 
recently entered the Gary service, selected from day to 
day such topics as in her own words seemed “‘to fit in 
best.”” Her plan book showed for one class a succession 
of lessons dealing with seeds, pussy willow stories, a field 
trip for branches, the transplanting of seedlings; for an- 
other, a field trip for willows, a lesson on sparrows, a les- 
son on robins. In the main, however, her work was 
connected with the garden. In management it did not 
differ materially from the lesson above described. For 
instance, a class studying the dry bean first observed the 
object, followed the teacher’s exposition and drawing of 
its characteristics, read silently an account in a conveni- 
ent text, and then returned to the object. Finally, the 
common words employed were used as a spelling lesson. 
Subsequent visits to the school in the course of the spring 
found the children working in the garden effectively and

-P-A-G-E-56

-P-A-G-E-57
INSTRUCTION IN NATURE STUDY 27 
with a fair amount of intelligent oversight. In general, 
the teacher—and in a measure this is true in other schools 
also—being left without central guidance, having there- 
fore to work out everything independently, and having 
a long teaching day, had neither time nor energy to 
prepare a coherent course or to secure and prepare the 
materials which the work required. 
The work offered in these schools differs only in respect 
to variety. The kindergarten children of the Emerson 
school, for example, care for hens of different kinds and 
study the differences in their eggs and in their young; 
they own a turtle, rabbits, and gold fish, of which they 
have charge. The topics selected for study were, how- 
ever, of the kinds already described and the work was 
similarly conducted. At the Froebel, lessons were in 
progress dealing with poison ivy, the peanut, points of 
the compass, etc. Noticeable on one occasion was the 
presence of three “helpers,” who remained in the room 
throughout the entire hour with nothing to do and with 
no opportunity for codperation. Once when one of the 
helpers became restless, the teacher turned to her with 
the words: “Real helpers must not disturb. Please 
be quiet.” The order was obeyed. 
A third grade class at the Emerson is described by its 
teacher as having pursued the following program, giving 
to it one hour daily, five days weekly, for forty weeks: 
The time was divided into four periods. In these periods were stud- 
ied: first, the earth, or geography; second, the plant world; third, the 
animal world; and fourth, nature stories. In the first section of the year
-P-A-G-E-58
  28 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the children talked and learned of Gary, the city in which they live; of 
Lake County, the county in which their city is located; of Indiana, 
the state in which they live; of the United States as the country in which 
they live, and North America as the continent of which the United States 
isa part. These topics were covered briefly, and the points emphasized 
were those with which the children were somewhat familiar and in which 
their experience led them to be interested. Plant life was studied even 
more briefly because of the probability that these children would go to the 
botany class for such studies in the next year. 
In the study of animal life the children chose the animals in the school’s 
collection which most interested them, the coyotes, raccoon, prairie dog, 
gray wolf, porcupine, skunk, rabbit, hares, etc. The topics included 
inquiry as to where these animals are found in their natural state, what 
they eat, whether they are harmful or harmless, and what use is made of 
them in the commercial world. When the class had finished the list of 
animals in the school’s zoo, they were allowed to choose any other animal 
about which they wanted to learn. 
In the spring a small amount of work was done in the identification of 
birds, with the result that the pupils as a class learned the names of 53 
birds. 
During a part of the year post cardnature study pictures were given the 
children and stories were written about the animals in the picture. Most 
of the children in the class learned the names of the cocoons in the collec- 
tion in the room, could distinguish one from the other, and were able to 
identify the moths when they emerged. They also learned the difference 
between a moth and a butterfly. In helping to keep the large aquarium 
clean they learned of algal forms and examined a few of them under the 
microscope. 
In the nature study stories, attempt was made to choose the stories 
with care so that the ideas given in the story would be true to the facts 
of natural history and awaken in the minds of the children not only an 
interest in, but appreciation of, animals. 
The foregoing was one of the few outlines which the 
author was able to procure.

VI. BOTANY AND GARDENING 
(A) FROEBEL SCHOOL 
r | “HE Froebel school equipment for botany and 
gardening includes an excellent laboratory! in 
which there is equipment, such as aquaria, labora- 
tory materials of the usual kinds, a few microscopes, seed 
collections, garden magazines and seed catalogues. One 
large room is used for indoor laboratory work, recitation 
and conferences, reading room, and individual work room 
for any botany pupil who is engaged in work upon a 
project. This combination of various interests centered 
about a particular science study in high schools is to be 
strongly commended as a great improvement upon the 
too common plan of separation into “Laboratory” and 
“Class Room” or, still worse, ‘Lecture Room.” The 
room is a work room or shop in which pupils and teacher 
conduct experiments, discuss, read, report, or write re- 
cords, and is immensely preferable to the differentiated 
and technically scholastic high school practice of having 
recitation or lecture in one room, laboratory in another, 
reading in a third room, and too often no very real 
problems to solve in any one of these rooms. The botany 
work room in the Froebel school and the other science   
1See illustration opposite page 44. 
20
-P-A-G-E-60
  30 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
rooms at Gary are planned to centralize and focus interest 
upon the problems to be met. The Froebel teacher of 
botany has, as will be seen in a later statement, developed 
the work so as to centralize about the garden all the bot- 
any work within doors and out of doors. Indeed the 
garden is the dominant center of all the work and the 
botany room quite properly is little more than a means 
of carrying on those aspects of the work which cannot be 
conducted out of doors. 
The school garden consists of several acres, the whole 
area including 16 acres. At the time of inspection of 
the school work, there were approximately 300 gardens in 
use, and this number could be increased by subdivision of 
the gardens as needed. 
(B) EMERSON SCHOOL 
The Emerson school is provided with a small school 
garden and a school ground of several acres upon which 
considerable shrubbery is planted. In the school build- 
ing there is provision made for growing plants indoors 
by the use of the windows at the stair landings as green- 
houses, by the use of a section of the botany laboratory, 
and by the use of the hallways. In the laboratory there 
is the usual equipment of aquaria, tables, microscopes, 
etc., not differing from the equipment of ordinary 
laboratories sufficiently to justify further description. 
The school makes a commendable use of a single room 
for laboratory, demonstration, recitation, and study, thus 
making all the indoor material available at any time.
-P-A-G-E-61
  BOTANY AND GARDENING 31 
The garden work of the other schools is mentioned in 
connection with the discussion of work in nature study. 
In the botany work of the Froebel elementary school, 
no effort is made to follow any of the ordinarily accepted 
grade courses of study. In the high school course, while 
a regular text is used as source of reading material, ex- 
tensive readjustments are made in order and in content. 
In the grade garden work the teacher makes excellent 
use of out-of-door experiences and classroom study by 
organizing these into definite topics, often projects. A 
coherent sequence of topics or projects is not regarded as 
essential, but vitality of each topic or project is entirely 
essential to the plan pursued. The time allowed for 
the grade work in the Froebel school is one hour daily. 
The following statement of work done by the sixth 
grade class may be taken as fairly representative of the 
work in this school: 
PROJECT—HARVESTING 
The work of this grade (6C boys and girls) consists largely of garden 
work with just as much of the science of botany thrown into the scheme 
as will help in understanding the different situations. In the “harvest 
scheme” there are included those things which pertain to gathering of 
material from the garden which could have any possible immediate or 
future use. The work is grouped into the following divisions: - 
1. Gathering and disposing of all (edible) crops 
For home use from individual gardens- 
For domestic science use 
For sale 
For storage for winter 
2. Selection, collection, cleaning, labeling and preservation of fruits 
and seeds (both flowers and vegetables) for use in the school 
gardens the following year
-P-A-G-E-62
32 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
3. Transplanting for schoolrooms and for conservatory use 
4. Gathering and storing tender perennials (gladioli, dahlias, etc.) 
In addition to the garden work, there are occasional field trips, in which 
underground parts, and fruits and seeds were especially studied; also 
occasional periods were used in the Froebel Park where the time was 
spent in such practical work as tillage, spraying, etc. 
In gathering vegetables and in transplanting, etc., the children come 
in contact not only with a large number of kinds of plants but they 
also come in contact with various kinds of underground parts, and come 
to know them and distinguish them rather easily. Such underground 
parts are: 
i carrot, lettuce 
1. Soil roots—Tap-roots { cabbage, parsley 
Clustered dahlia 
onions 
Fibrous _ {potato 
tomato 
2. Tubers—Potatoes, and Mexican potatoes which also have aérial 
tubers 
3. Bulbs—Onions; Lilies 
4. Corms—Caladium, Gladiolus 
Rootstocks—Canna, Ferns 
This class also had an opportunity to plant a large bed of bulbs and 
corms—hyacinths, tulips, daffodils, Bermuda lilies and crocuses. 
In collecting their seeds, over ninety different species were collected, 
labeled, and preserved. The pupils had an excellent opportunity of 
studying the various problems connected with fruits and seed; such as: 
Seed selection 
Variation 
Cleaning, drying and preserving for winter 
Seed distribution 
Germination of self-sown seeds of lettuce, hollyhocks, etc. 
Origin of fruits and seeds 
Pollination and fertilization 
Edible and non-edible fruits 
Structure of seed including: 
Food storage, 
Seed-coats, and embryo.

BOTANY AND GARDENING 33 
In connection with the above outline of work such 
topics as the following were considered: climbing and 
procumbent plants; annuals, biennials, biannuals, and per- 
ennials; deciduous and evergreen; plant diseases, insecti- 
cides and fungicides; kinds of food stored and where. 
The teacher used the garden work as the basis of audi- 
torium programs to be given before other members of 
the school. For example, a group of sixth grade boys 
presented their work under the heading “Interesting 
Commercial Plants.” They presented discussions of 
tobacco, pop-corn, peanuts, flax, castor bean, cotton, 
and clover. A group of sixth grade girls presented 
“Seed Distribution” and used wild and cultivated 
plants, drawings, and demonstration experiments. An- 
other group of fifth grade girls presented a ‘‘Thanks- 
giving Harvest Play” as an auditorium exercise. In 
addition to the plant studies used in this play,;they stud- 
ied and presented some of the harvest time customs of 
ancient Greece and Rome and early America. 
An auditorium science program of this type is said 
to require for preparation an average of approximately 
two weeks of the scheduled science time. This expen- 
diture of time can be justified on the ground that the 
auditorium supplies a strong motive for rounding up 
the work done, and gives training in presentation of a 
subject to others. 
The following is a list of the projects which appear 
in the teacher’s outline of work for the botany and gar- 
dening course:

Preparation of Gardens and Shrubs for the Winter

Soils 
Study of the Struggle for Existence among Plants 
Study of Seed Dispersal 
Study of Plant Distribution in the Region of the School 
Meaning of Photosynthesis 
Relation of Plants to Water 
Types of Flowering Plants for Home Use 
Of the course above outlined it may be said that it 
can be readily adjusted to meet the needs of pupils of 
different ages. This was the more essential because 
classes not infrequently contained pupils some of whom 
had already studied the subject, while others were just 
beginning it, and still others who gave different amounts 
of time to the work, as well as assistants and helpers. 
At the Emerson school the course in botany is taken 
primarily by seventh and eighth grade pupils. Different 
divisions of the seventh grade are taught together as one 
class; i.e., 7A’s, 7B’s, and 7C’s are combined. The 
seventh grade work is based primarily upon the care of 
the garden, the shrubbery on the school grounds, and 
the potted plants which are kept in the schoolroom green- 
house and in the hallways of the school building. The 
high school course, which is provided for pupils in the

-P-A-G-E-66

-P-A-G-E-67
  BOTANY AND GARDENING 35 
ninth grade, is based upon the outline of work which 
appears in a course called*“ Practical Botany.” The 
textbook is followed quite closely, the laboratory and 
demonstration work being of a conventional nature de- 
signed to illustrate the points discussed in the text. The 
course which is given to the seventh grade runs through- 
out the year and is recorded as having a full hour each 
day five times a week for that period. Observations led 
to the conclusion that this schedule was not followed 
regularly since there was evidence that pupils sometimes 
were engaged less than the full hour, sometimes about 
half an hour, and sometimes less than five days per week. 
In some cases the pupils had a half hour with the botany 
teacher and a half hour with the physics teacher. 
The following comprehensive outline of seventh and 
eighth grade courses was supplied by the teacher. It 
was explained by the teacher that no class covered all 
the topics in the outline.

A single day’s eighth grade exercise may be described 
in order to illustrate the regular outdoor work. Some 
pupils were engaged in pruning shrubbery, others in 
hoeing and raking the soil about the plants, which were 
both shrubs and annual flowering plants; some were 
watering plants, some were watering the house plants 
within the building, pulling off dead leaves, and pruning 
away broken portions. It was stated that no employed
-P-A-G-E-75
  
BOTANY AND GARDENING 41 
workman assists in caring for these plants, all 
the work being done by the eighth grade botany 
students, under supervision of the teacher of botany. 
The garden work is also done by this class. They not 
only give the ordinary care to planting, cultivating and 
harvesting the crops, but do the heavy work of wheeling 
or carting manures, spading, and construction of cold 
frames or other structures that are needed in the garden. 
The pupils engaged in these activities evidently took 
great pleasure in their work. Indoor related work in- 
cludes such topics as the care and improvement of soils, 
proper selection of garden and farm seeds, preparation 
of and practice with spelling lists containing names of 
plants, processes, or implements. Occasional field trips 
are made to adjacent regions, but these must have been 
rare and brief since the pupils have but one hour avail- 
able each day for this work. No single textbook is used 
but numerous books are made available so that pupils 
may learn the proper care of plants in lawn, garden, and 
schoolroom. 
The ninth grade course, which is based upon one of 
the common texts in botany, does not follow the order 
of presentation in the text—a commendable variation. 
Local considerations should largely decide as to the 
order and nature of materials presented. Very prop- 
erly, too, no effort was made to handle separately 
recitation, class discussion, and laboratory work. The 
work in hand was carried on by one method or another 
or by all, as circumstances suggested. On the other  
-P-A-G-E-76
  42 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
hand, there was evidence that this particular ninth grade 
class did little work out of doors. The microscopic 
work and the drawings about the hallways—enlarged as 
they were from textbook plates—appeared to be of slight 
educational value.

  VII. ZOOLOGY 
(A) EMERSON SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 
I NOR instruction in zoology, the Emerson school 
is equipped with an excellent combination labo- 
ratory and recitation room which includes 
aquaria in abundance for work with aquatic animals. 
There is also a large room in the building for various 
kinds of animals, which are cared for by the elementary 
and high school pupils. This room is equipped with a 
large coop for poultry, containing pigeons and chickens, 
and cages for such animals as the porcupine and rabbits. 
Another room is occupied by incubators, of which three 
are provided for poultry work managed by the depart- 
ment of zoology. Out of doors there is extensive 
equipment for the care of animals, including a poultry 
house, incubators and brooding house, a pigeon house, 
large cages for quadrupeds, such as the wolf, coyote, 
fox, raccoon, porcupine, prairie dogs, large cages for a 
number of kinds of wild duck, and pens for runways 
for various kinds of poultry. At the time of the survey 
the live poultry included a pen of 26 white leghorn hens, 
42 Rhode Island red hens, several dozens of carneaux 
pigeons, several kinds of wild ducks, and several kinds of 
pheasants. There is a small barn in which the horses 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  44 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
and implements used by the school are kept. This de- 
partment is the best equipped science department in the 
Gary schools. 
(B) FROEBEL SCHOOL EQUIPMENT 
In the Froebel school the equipment for the depart- 
ment of zoology consists of a good laboratory-recitation 
room, in which there are aquaria, making it possible to 
keep various kinds of living animals. There is no col- 
lection of animals and no poultry yard or other equipment 
comparable with those of the Emerson school. 
(c) THE EMERSON COURSE IN ZOOLOGY 
The entire department of zoology at the Emerson 
school was in charge of a well trained and effective in- 
structor assisted by a trained assistant in poultry hus- 
bandry and a workman who looked after the horses and 
the barn, etc. The class studying the subject of zoology 
was composed in the main of high school pupils from the 
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades. The course ran for 
40 weeks and occupied two hours a day, five days weekly. 
The time was so divided that two months were given to the 
study of insects in the autumn, three or four months tothe 
study of the main animal groups, a month or six weeks to 
physiology, and the rest of the year to the study of ma- 
terials collected from the environment. Individual proj- 
ects were largely employed and elaborately developed. 
The instruction in zoology was in the main related to 
various types of animal activities. It is not possible to 
furnish a complete account of the topics touched on in

ZOOLOGY 45 
the course of the year, but the way in which a topic is 
handled is indicated by the treatment of insects. The 
grasshopper, June bug, and Cecropia moth were used 
as types of insect structure. The class did labora- 
tory work with these forms, including discussions and 
detailed drawings. The text used for this part of the 
work treats such topics as “Insects and Plants,” “In- 
sects and Human Disease,” “Insect Enemies of Live 
Stock,” ‘Beneficial Insects,” ‘Household Insects,” 
“Human Parasites,” and “Insect Control.” Since Gary 
is often infested in the summer by mosquitoes in large 
numbers, the class made a detailed study of mosquitoes 
and outlined methods for ridding the community of these 
pests. Field trips were conducted so that the pupils 
might determine the number and kinds of places in which 
mosquitoes develop, and collect specimens for laboratory 
use. Field trips were also conducted for the collection of 
cocoons of various kinds of moths, and these were cared for 
in the laboratory. Also caterpillars were collected and 
kept in the laboratory until they made their cocoons. 
It has been stated that much of the work in zoology 
takes the form of individual projects. This is especially 
true of work with pets and fowls. For example, the care 
of the pigeons and squabs in the animal house was as- 
signed to two girls; a boy looked after a group of wild 
ducks and tried to grow the young wild ducks in 
captivity; three girls were assigned to the care of the 
animal room in the school building, each having her own 
time and responsibilities connected with the work. One
-P-A-G-E-82
  46 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
girl had charge of a pen of golden pheasants, another of 
the silver pheasants, and still another of the ring pheas- 
ants. In order to secure time for their projects, indi- 
vidual programs were so arranged as to allow a one hour 
period daily for the work. 
In the autumn of 1915 an ambitious project in poultry 
work was undertaken in the Emerson school. It began 
with thirty chickens. During the fall pupils cleaned and 
disinfected the animal cages, kept the lot clean, mixed 
feeds for the poultry, and cared for them in various 
ways. The pupils also built a concrete foundation and 
a floor 14x 14 feet for the poultry house, and assisted 
in the construction of a cement room in which it was 
proposed to carry on the incubation and breeding of 
young poultry. When out-of-door work was impossible, 
there was blackboard drill in the study of feeds, housing, 
etc. Diagrams were made by the pupils to show how to 
construct feeding boxes and brooding houses. Pupils of 
all ages from the third to the tenth grade participated in 
these activities. 
A period of 13 weeks was devoted to the special prob- 
lem of fattening selected chickens for the market. The 
construction of a special fattening crate became neces- 
sary; plans were drawn roughly on a blackboard and dis- 
cussed, and the crate was ultimately constructed by the 
pupils themselves in the carpentry shop. As more time 
was required than could be given on the regular school 
schedule, several pupils came after school hours, even at 
night, to work on the crates.
-P-A-G-E-83
ZOOLOGY 47 
The pupils bought the chickens, weighed them, and 
placed them in the fattening crate, and kept records of 
their progress. 
The table on page 48 and the chart on page 48a are 
fair samples of the records kept. 
Unfortunately, the pupils were left so largely to their 
own devices, that errors were frequent. Pupils were thus 
misled as to the results obtained, and the incidental 
benefit expected from the vitalization of work in mathe- 
matics was lost. On the other hand, the work was inter- 
esting in itself and gave the pupils both information and 
skill that are of great value. 
The incubators were also handled as projects by suc- 
cessive groups of three pupils in charge for periods of 
three weeks each. The boys gave to the work one period 
daily of school time and such time after school as was re- 
quired. Responsibility was so divided that one boy regu- 
lated the heat, while the others watched the eggs. Egg 
testing with a view to the elimination of infertile eggs 
was carried on in the presence of the rest of the class. 
The number of children responsibly engaged in poultry 
projects at any one time obviously cannot be large. 
On the other hand, at the time of the survey, 72 children 
were counted about the poultry yards in the course of a 
single day. Most of them appeared to have no definite 
task; yet their interest, as manifested in questions, was 
both wholesome and helpful, and absence of definite 
assignment is therefore not necessarily evidence of ab- 
sence of important educational values.

  ZOOLOGY 49 
In addition to the tabulated records already presented, 
pupils working on projects in zoology are obliged to sub- 
mit a written report of their work. The following is an 
example: 
POULTRY FATTENING 
Part of our poultry work has been the study of milk fattening. This 
kind of fattening makes the flesh of the birds sweeter, whiter and tenderer 
so that it cooks very much easier. We have a special ration for feeding 
the birds which consists of butter milk 8 parts, corn meal two parts, 
ground oats 1 part, and shorts 1 part. 
We boys went down to Tittle Brothers Store on Fifteenth and Broad- 
way and bought sixteen spring chickens. We then brought them over 
to school and put them in a fattening crate which was 4 feet long and 3 
feet wide. It was made of slats with a wire bottom and with troughs 
along in front for the feed. The crate is divided into two compartments, 
each compartment holding 8 birds. 
We put a leg band on the right leg of each chicken to tell them apart 
and to tell which one of them gained the most during the period of fatten- 
ing which was two weeks. 
The boys divided the time into three periods. James Allison had the 
first period, I had the second period, and Lawrence Tittle had the third 
period. We fed the birds every morning at 7:30 and every evening at 
4:30. The feed had to be mixed and let stand for twelve hours before 
using. We let the birds eat for 30 min. and then what was left we 
weighed back and added it to next days feed. Here is a chart showing 
the different gains and feed consumed in the three periods.

1The reader is referred to page 47 for statements regarding the accu- 
racy of these computations.
-P-A-G-E-88
  50 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Here we note that in the first period we had the most gain and in the 
last period we had most feed consumed and very little gain. This proves 
that it pays to feed only about one week as the last two periods the birds 
did not gain enough to pay for their feed. 
We kept a table telling time of day, temperature, the weigh-in for feed- 
ing, the weigh-back after feeding, the feed consumed, and any remarks. 
We let the birds fast twenty-four hours before killing. On Saturday 
morning we came over to school and with the assistance of Mr. Stewart 
we killed and dressed the chickens. They were weighed after they were 
killed, after they were picked, and after they were drawn. Then we let 
them lie in salt water for about an hour and then we wrapped them and 
delivered them to homes where they had been ordered. The birds sold for 
from _75 to go cents. All three of us boys liked the work very much and 
we were all up helping each other every morning and evening during the 
three periods. And I can say myself that I would a hundred times rather 
eat milk chicken than I would the ordinary grain fed ones. 
A pigeon project is thus described by the two girls 
who were responsible for it: 
About March ist, we two girls, who are students of the Emerson 
Zoology Department took charge of the pigeons belonging to the School. 
These pigeons are French or Carneaux pigeons. They have beautiful 
brownish red plumage. They are of good size and we have about 30 of 
them. When we took charge of the pigeon house there were no nests in it. 
After reading all available material on the subject of pigeon raising, 
we began at once to put the house in good condition for them. We first 
had it cleaned. Then we put nest divisions in the boxes. There are 
about thirty nest boxes in the room, fifteen on each side. The first 
row is about four feet from the floor. The boxes are about one and one- 
half feet square. The divisions are boards which cut the boxes into equal 
compartments. The board runs down the center and one closes the front 
of the nest box. These boards are about 5 inches in height. We next 
obtained tobacco stems and broke them into pieces. The pigeons made 
their nests of these. The tobacco stems help to keep the nests free from 
vermin. 
We have been feeding them barley in the hopper each day, witha 
dainty of Canadian peas and Kaffir corn every other day. Rock salt 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  ZOOLOGY sz 
is kept on the window of the house as pigeons seem to require salt in 
order to remain in good condition. They seem to be doing well on this 
line of food. 
There is a fly pen adjoining the house which is about eight feet by ten 
feet. In this there is a bath pen which is cleaned and filled with fresh 
water daily. The fly pen gives the birds a good place for exercise and 
for sunning themselves. 
The breeding season is now here and up to this time we have eight 
squabs which seem to be growing large and fine. There is a man in 
Chicago who furnishes the Blackstone Hotel their full supply of squabs. 
Chances like this are not hard to find if one can guarantee a supply. A 
great many hotels, boarding places, hospitals and sanitariums give yearly 
contracts for squabs and pay good prices. There is much profit in squab 
taising and the work is not hard. We would advise any one to take up 
this work if the opportunity offers, for we have derived much pleasure 
from it in the short time we have been working at it.

  VIII. PHYSICS 
HE physics laboratory of the Emerson school, 
used by both elementary and high school 
pupils, includes a combination laboratory and 
recitation room, a shop room,! and a storage room. 
While some of the ordinary pieces of physical ap- 
paratus were found, most of the equipment consisted 
of extremely simple apparatus such as is met in every- 
day experience, and of machines of various kinds which 
illustrate physical principles. Discarded machinery— 
such as weighing devices, photographic cameras, a sew- 
ing machine, an automobile engine, automobile bodies 
and bicycles—were collected in the shop for the use of 
students of physics. The whole department had the 
appearance of an ordinary shop rather than that of a 
physics laboratory. The equipment could be used with- 
out danger of serious damage or heavy financial loss. 
The equipment of the Froebel school laboratory 
was less noteworthy.2 In addition to ordinary school 
apparatus, it contained a small number of appliances 
derived from the activities of the environment. 
At the time of the survey, instruction in physics in 
1See illustration opposite page 54.

52
-P-A-G-E-91
  PHYSICS 53 
the Emerson school was given to two fourth grade 
classes, a fifth grade class and a high school class in 
which two high school grades were combined. It was 
shown by inquiries in other studies that there were 
pupils in the upper high school class who had not studied 
the subject. These may have been pupils who had en- 
tered the Gary schools from other school systems. 
A term of thirteen weeks was devoted to the study 
of physics by the grades. The course was based upon 
twenty-five experiments. Before performing an experi- 
ment, the instructor endeavored to elicit from the pupils 
their experiences and observations bearing directly or 
indirectly upon it. The metric system was made real 
by requiring that pupils weigh and measure freely in 
both metric and English systems, thus learning how to 
convert one into the other; the relations of diameter and 
circumference were experimentally ascertained as the 
basis of developing the formula expressing them; various 
bicycle gears and their different effects were studied; 
thermometers, ice machines, ventilation, water, gas and 
electric meters, automobile engines and other topics 
were taken up in the same fashion; appliances were ob- 
served and experimented with and gradually the pupils 
were led back to the underlying principles and laws. 
Finally, throughout the course, the pupils were required 
to make in their notebooks lists of new words used in the 
physics course. 
As illustrations of the manner of conducting the work 
of the elementary school pupils, an exercise dealing with 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  54 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the manufacture of electric cells, and an exercise dealing 
with the use of wheels of different sizes, may be de- 
scribed. 
At the outset six metals were tested in pairs in order 
to determine which pair gave the strongest electrical 
current when placed in a weak solution of sulphuric acid. 
The pupils worked in small groups, each making his own 
record of results observed and the methods by which 
they were secured. One fourth grade boy having been 
absent on the preceding day had missed the introductory 
experiment made to develop an electric current. Hear- 
ing what had been done the day before, he went off by 
himself with the materials needed, tried the experiment 
himself, and prepared the records of his results with as 
constant interest and faithfulness in performance as 
could ordinarily have been secured from a much older 
student. 
For the study of the relations between wheels of dif- 
ferent sizes a number of small wooden wheels or disks 
of various sizes are provided. The pupils are taught 
how to determine the circumference by rolling a disk for 
one complete revolution upon the table, then measuring 
the distance covered. A good many trials are required 
before some students could see the relation which exists 
between the circumference and the diameter, but a few 
students succeeded in four or five trials in determining 
the relation. A written report of the experiment is 
required and the arithmetical work involved is of a 
practical nature.

  PHYSICS 55 
Bicycles are brought into the room and the pupils 
are required to determine the “gear” of the different 
machines. The instructor stated that an ordinary class 
will be able to determine the gear of two differently 
geared bicycles in a laboratory period of sixty minutes. 
The following is an outline of the questions and direc- 
tions given to the pupils for this work: 
Object—to find the gear of two different bicycles. 
Apparatus—bicycle and measuring stick. 
Manipulation—Count the number of sprockets in both the large and 
small sprocket wheel. Measure the diameter of the rear wheel in- 
cluding the tire. To find the gear multiply the diameter of the rear 
wheel by the quotient obtained by dividing the number of large 
sprockets by the small sprockets. 
Wheel No. 1. 
Number of sprockets in large sprocket wheel. 
Number of sprockets in small sprocket wheel—_———. 
Quotient = number of large sprockets+number of small sprockets: % 
Quotientdiameter= —————gear. 
Wheel No. 2. 
Number of sprockets in large sprocket whee_————. 
Number of sprockets in small sprocket wheel: 
Quotient = number of large sprockets+number of small sprockets-———. 
QuotientX<diameter= -————gear. 
Conclusion—Does the high or low gear cause the wheel to run the faster? 
Which is easier to push up a grade or against the wind? 
What class of lever is used in the pedal chain and sprocket wheel of a   
bicycle? 
Where is the force located? The weight? The fulcrum? 
Spelling—1. gear 6. coaster 
2. sprocket 7. pedal 
3. Tear 8. spoke 
4. quotient 9. speed 
5. bicycle 10. velocity 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
  56 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The bicycle offers a good problem for pupils in deter- 
mining the relation between fulcrum point and applica- 
tion of force and weight in the bicycle pedal. Also the 
idea of levers is well illustrated in the use of scales, tee- 
tering board and wheelbarrow, and all of these are used 
in this experiment. 
This exercise also serves to illustrate the correlation 
between physics and shop work. After the preceding 
calculations, the class is taken to the machine shop, 
where there is a machine with a belted wheel and a 
motor. The pupils calculate the comparative diameters 
of the belted wheel of the motor and the belted wheel of 
the machine to be driven. The instructor checks the 
pupils’ measurements by the exact facts as determined 
by himself or recorded by the engineer who installed the 
machinery. The number of revolutions of the two 
wheels is determined; in this way the pupils gain an 
impression of how increasing the speed of one wheel 
may result in a change in the nature of the work that may 
be accomplished by a wheel of a different size. 
The high school course in the same subject was based 
on one of the more comprehensive high school textbooks. 
The course did not appear to differ materially from that 
given in any one of a large number of high schools. 
At the Froebel school the physics work of the elemen- 
tary grades was of the same general character as that of 
the Emerson school, but it was less efficiently managed. 
Experiments were performed and demonstrations made 
in the presence of the children who were encouraged to
-P-A-G-E-97
  
PHYSICS 57 
comment and ask questions. But in the lessons ob- 
served, the questions were neither well answered nor 
directed toward further experiments and the phenomena 
were not well explained. In consequence, an unfavor- 
able judgment must be recorded on the ground that the 
course was both inconsequential and unorganized. 
In the Froebel high school, no outline of the work 
was procurable, though one of the commonly known 
textbooks was in use. The complete list found in the 
students’ notebooks showed the range of the experi- 
mental work undertaken. Forty experiments covering 
the usual high school course in physics were outlined in 
one notebook. In other notebooks examined, the num- 
ber of experiments recorded varied considerably: one 
contained 32, another 25, still another 18. In the classes 
visited, it was clear that the day’s work had not been 
carefully planned or foreseen, but was, more or less, con- 
trolled by chance. Nor was the teacher’s standard suf- 
ficiently exacting. Experiments described in the pupils’ 
notebooks were at times ‘“‘approved” or “o. k.’d” 
with the teacher’s initials added, despite serious errors in 
calculation, spelling, and plain evidence that the phe- 
nomena described were misunderstood and incompletely 
recorded.

Ix. CHEMISTRY 
‘T= Emerson and Froebel schools have each a 
commodious room which serves at once for reci- 
tation, lecture, and laboratory purposes. Each 
has an adjoining photographic room. The equipment 
provided is of the usual type to be found in satisfactorily 
equipped high schools; in addition, appliances of indus- 
trial character:are found.’ 
Chemistry is scheduled as being taught to sixth and 
eighth grade classes in the elementary school. In the high 
school it is elective, primarily in the second year, but is 
available to pupils in later years of the high school. No 
statement showing the details of the elementary school 
course in the Froebel school was procurable; on the occa- 
sions when the classes were visited the pupils were work- 
ing with cameras; but it was clear that no organized 
course of instruction was pursued. At the Emerson 
school a syllabus for the sixth and eighth grade classes 
had been prepared as follows: 
September—Enrollment and organization of classes. 
Work’on solution and crystallization. 
October —Starch conversions. 
November—Carbon and carbon compounds. 
December —Fermentation.

January —Nitrogen. 
February —Oxygen. 
March —Carbon dioxide. 
April —Solvay process for soda. 
May —Hydrogen, water. 
June —Juices of fruit as a solution. 
On the occasion of one visit the instruction was con- 
ducted by a teacher with a high school pupil acting as 
assistant. The class, numbering 27, of whom 6 were 
helpers, was divided into groups of 3 or 4. The class 
was engaged in making oxygen from chlorate of potash, 
according to specific directions which were written by 
the pupils at the teacher’s dictation. It was perhaps 
not without significance that a group of pupils in charge 
of the student assistant was wrongly advised regarding 
the things to be done, with incorrect results. No com- 
ment or explanation was made by the instructor at the 
time when his attention was called to the mishap. 
The high school course at the Froebel school was de- 
scribed as based upon a textbook supplemented by work 
on the various processes involved in the manufacture of 
steel. In the absence of outlines or notebooks this work 
could not be inspected; but during none of the visits 
to the class was any work of a supplementary character 
observed and no adequate outline of the work was 
available. 
In the Emerson school the high school work in chem- 
istry is of an industrial nature, relating to several import- 
ant industrial processes. For example, the coal used 
by the schools of Gary is tested by the chemistry class 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  
60 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
under the direction of the chemistry instructor. Samples 
taken from each wagon load of coal delivered to the 
school during any given month are locked in a metal 
sample can. They are then ground together so that a 
composite sample of the kinds of coal furnished for the 
entire month is secured. This composite sample is used 
for examination and is tested for calorific value early in 
the following month. It is stated that the results of 
the test are reported to the office, which on the 15th of 
each month pays the companies supplying the coal, 
basing the payment upon the pupils’ reports as to the 
calorific value of the coal furnished. It was further 
stated by the superintendent of schools and the head of 
the chemistry department that the work of the pupils is 
sufficiently accurate to be entirely satisfactory to the 
companies furnishing the coal and to the school authori- 
ties. 
Another experiment conducted by the high school 
class in chemistry had to do with the use of dyes of dif- 
ferent kinds in commercial jellies. Pupils tested jellies 
purchased from a number of shops, in order to determine, 
first, whether glucose was present and if so in what per- 
centage; second, whether cane sugar was present, and 
in what percentage; and third, what coloring materials 
had been employed. 
Still another type of work had been developed in codp- 
eration with the City Health Department and the food 
inspector. The instructor in chemistry in the Emerson 
school directed the work of the paid assistants who ex-

amine food and conduct bacterialogical tests for the 
Board. High and elementary school pupils were assist- 
ing, six at a time being assigned to the work after school 
hours. Each pupil must serve 133 hours in this work 
in order to secure one school credit. The pupils plated 
the milk samples to determine the number of bacteria 
present, washed and sterilized the glassware, measured 
the samples, labeled the plates, counted the colonies and 
estimated the number of bacteria per cubic centimeter. 
The teacher, together with the Board of Health as- 
sistant, the city food inspector and Board of Health 
officers, also conducted inspection trips with pupils. 
On these trips conditions of dairies, kinds and conditions 
of cows, and handling of milk containers and of milk were 
noted. Undesirable conditions were made the subject 
of official criticism to the owners in the presence of the 
pupils. Good and bad conditions alike were discussed 
with the owners. Subsequently compositions were 
written about these trips and these compositions were 
used as science and language lessons. At times 
auditorium exercises based upon the inspection trips 
were given before the entire school. There can be 
no question that substantial results, practical as well 
as educational, have been thus obtained, as is witnessed 
by the following composition by one of the pupils: 
CONDITION OF CONTAINERS 
The milk pail is an important utensil in the production of clean milk. 
In pails where the dirt which falls in does not remain, where the streams 
of milk strike against it, a strainer cloth aids in keeping down the number 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  
62 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
of bacteria which gain access to the milk. The metal strainer is safer 
where milkers are careless, as they will handle cheese cloth strainers 
and lay them down in dirty places. But we can obtain good results 
from cheese cloth if the milker is careful and sanitary cheese cloth is 
used. Milk pails should have all seams smoothly covered with solder. 
The aluminum pail is best because it is made in one piece without joints. 
After milking, all the utensils should be rinsed at once with cold water, 
then washed with hot water and washing-soda, and rinsed againin clean, 
cold water. Finally, all the metal dairy utensils should have boiling 
water poured over them, which sterilizes and dries them at once. Dairy 
utensils should never be dried with towels. Cans should be scalded with 
boiling water or have steam turned into them and be placed upside down 
so that air also may be admitted. Rusty cans should never be used as 
they sometimes give milk a fishy taste. This fishy flavor is said to be 
given to milk when washing soda is not well rinsed from dairy utensils. 
When the cans become much dented they are difficult to clean and should 
not be used. In Gary, if a rusty can comes into the city the milk is 
dumped out and a bright red label placed upon the can, saying that it 
is not to be sent with milk again. It is then sent to the owner and if it 
is again sent to the city with milk it is destroyed. 
Some people can remember when milk was peddled from house to 
house in a wagon, having one or two large pails, from. which the milk 
was dipped or drawn from faucets near the bottom of the pails. 
It is only within the last twenty-five years that the glass milk bottle 
came into general use. Then we thought all our troubles were at an 
end. It was soon found, however, that the glass milk bottle might be a 
source of real danger. The most danger against it is that it is likely to 
become infected and spread disease. Further, they are difficult to keep 
clean. The bottle may become infected in the household in many ways. 
For instance: A person with diphtheria may drink from the bottle, or it 
may have been wiped with a cloth which has been infected from a case 
of typhoid fever. If such a bottle is again filled with milk without proper 
disinfection, grave consequence may ensue. The manner in which milk 
bottles are cleaned at a dairy before they are again filled with milk would 
not meet the approval of a careful housewife. Therefore, milk bottles 
should always be thoroughly cleaned by the householder before they are 
returned to the dairy. 
Milk wagons should be kept in a good condition, also. A wide step

should be affixed to the wagon behind on which the driver may stand 
when getting bottles at the rear of the wagon. A sheet iron floor with 
. an open slit at either side running the whole length to permit water 
draining is a good idea. The wagon should be kept well painted for the 
good of the milk and for looks, also. If milk is allowed to remain on the 
floor, dirt and disease may collect to contaminate the milk. It is a good 
idea to have the ice placed in the boxes where the milk is kept.
-P-A-G-E-108
  X. TESTS 
voted to the preparation of tests in the usual 
school subjects, and in some subjects a considerable 
amount of comparative data has been assembled. Thus, 
tests in spelling and in certain arithmetical operations 
have been given to such large numbers of school children 
working under fairly uniform conditions that standards 
of performance have been established in those subjects. 
In reading and composition progress has been made. 
There are as yet no accurate standards by means of which 
to test the results of science teaching in any adequate 
way. Our confidence that the study of science is val- 
uable is based upon general observation and reasoning, 
rather than on definite demonstration in the form of the 
results actually secured. 
Though, for the reasons stated, it was impossible to 
measure the science teaching at Gary as the teaching of 
some other subjects was measured, efforts were never- 
theless made to determine by practical tests what 
amount of ability pupils possessed in the observation, 
discrimination, and interpretation of phenomena. The 
tests utilized were intended to include: 
(z) Some elements or features so simple that only 
64. I: RECENT years much attention has been de-
-P-A-G-E-109
  TESTS 65 
distinctly poor pupils would fail to give accept- 
able responses to them; 
(2) Some elements which would elicit acceptable 
responses from the majority of pupils who 
had attained the types of ability in question; 
(3) Some elements to which acceptable responses would 
be made only by those pupils who possess the 
types of ability in question in a marked degree. 
It is not possible as yet to state how much harder the 
elements last mentioned are than those first mentioned, 
but the kind of difference in question may be illustrated 
by reference to an observation and discrimination test 
based upon two bird pictures, in one of which the bird 
has a distinct “top-knot” and a small and inconspicuous 
hook-tipped bill, while in the other the bird has no 
“top-knot” but has a straight-tipped bill. Nearly all 
pupils tested noted the first points of contrast, and only 
quite accurate observers noted the second point. 
Nine tests were used in the five eighth grade classes in 
the Emerson, Jefferson and Froebel schools, and in the 
seventh grade in the Beveridge school; and in the twelfth 
grade high school classes in the Emerson and Froebel 
schools. The tests may be classified into three groups, 
though the particular feature tested in any one group 
necessarily appears in some measure also in each of the 
other groups. 
The first group dealt with observation and discrimi- 
nation based upon objects which were placed before the 
pupils. This group consisted of two pairs of tests, each
-P-A-G-E-110
66 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
pair including one test in observation and discrimination 
based upon objects which, superficially at least, were 
quite different, and another test based upon objects 
which, superficially at least, were less different. For ex- 
ample, the first test was based upon a leaf from a white 
oak tree and one from an elm tree, each pupil having 
before him the pair of leaves, with instructions to indi- 
cate all the differences by means of which he could dis- 
tinguish one of the leaves from the other. Following 
this test was one based upon a leaf from a white oak tree 
and one from a red oak tree. In the other pair of obser- 
vation and discrimination tests, the first one was based 
upon colored pictures of the kingbird and the king- 
fisher, birds which are strikingly different; and the sec- 
ond upon the kingbird and crested flycatcher, birds 
which at first glance are less readily distinguished. 
The second group of tests relates primarily to the 
pupil’s ability to recognize natural phenomena, to recall 
experiences in science study, and to make constructive 
statements regarding these experiences. The first of 
these tests was based upon accurately colored pictures of 
common birds, each pupil having before him a card with 
the pictures upon it, from which he was to recall and then 
write the names of the birds. Of the two other tests in 
this group, one was based upon the names of ten common 
birds, the other upon the names of ten common insects, 
each pupil being asked to select four from each list of 
ten and to answer certain questions about each of the 
four birds and the four insects which he selected. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  TESTS 67 
The third group consisted of two tests of ability to 
give reasons for, to interpret, or to explain changing 
phenomena, the changes occurring in the presence of 
the pupils in the form of an experiment or demonstration, 
One of these tests was based upon certain facts related 
to gravity, the space-occupying property of air and the 
fact that water is heavier than air. The other test 
dealt with the fact that heated air is crowded upward 
by incoming colder air. 
It should be emphasized that these tests cannot be 
said to do more than test abilities as related to the par- 
ticular objects and processes used in these particular test 
experiments. The extent to which the results may be 
related to abilities in thinking about other science ma- 
terials cannot be known until further investigations have 
been made; nor do these tests show the extent to which 
the results were due wholly to instruction in science 
alone. The pupils, so far as is known, had had no 
specific training in the use of the exercises upon which 
the tests were based, but in most cases they had more or 
less science work of types supposed to give acquaintance 
with common phenomena and to develop observation 
and discrimination. 
The pupils tested were asked to indicate whether they 
had pursued nature study, elementary or general science, 
physiology, physiography, botany, zoology, physics, chem- 
istry, or agriculture. Of the 191 reporting in the elemen- 
tary school classes, 133 stated they had studied science 
of some kind; 47 that they had not; 11 did not answer
-P-A-G-E-112
    68 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
this question. Since the reports by the same pupil 
differed on this point in different papers, the above 
figures regarding previous science studies cannot be re- 
garded as entirely reliable. Pupils were also asked to 
indicate how long they have been in the Gary schools. 
The length of time varied from one year to nine years 
(nine years in only two cases). In one case an eighth 
grade pupil had entered the school the day before the 
information was asked for. The average number of years 
in the Gary schools for 184 of the 191 elementary school 
pupils, as reported by the pupils themselves, was 4.97 
years. The remaining seven pupils did not answer the 
question. 
TEST NUMBER I 
_ On each of forty plain gray cards, 11x 14 inches in size, 
there was mounted a pair of leaves, one from an elm tree 
and one from an oak tree, each leaf properly named.! 
Each card was numbered so that any evidence of in- 
dividual variations in the leaves might be checked, in 
case such evidence appeared in the answers. The 
leaves had been carefully collected, dried and mounted 
so as to secure as nearly as possible a uniform set of 
leaves. It must be kept in mind that the materials were 
prepared, not for instruction regarding the leaves of elms 
and oaks, nor to test ability to discriminate between 
oak and elm leaves in general, but to test ability to ob- 
serve and discriminate between characteristics of the two 
leaves which were placed before the pupil.

The cards and printed blanks were placed face down- 
ward upon the pupils’ desks, the pupils being told not 
to turn them over until directed todo so. When all were 
distributed, the pupils were told to turn the blank sheets, 
to read the directions as the instructor read them aloud, 
and then fill in the personal data called for. When the 
personal data had been entered, the pupils were given 
the hour and minute to be entered in the first time blank, 
then told to turn the cards, and go to work. 
The blank for test 1 appears on page 69. 
After studying a large number of answers which were 
given, a list of the points which might be expected in a 
complete answer to the test was prepared. This list, 
which was used as the fact-basis for scoring or grading 
the papers of test 1, is as follows: 
1. Shape or form of the leaves. 
Size of the leaves. 
Color and color markings. 
Surface—rough, smooth, hairy, uneven. 
Margin—appearance, notched margin, smooth or 
toothed margin. 
Midrib—present, absent, heavy, light. 
Veins—present, direction, free or joining. 
Stems—size, length, form. 
Base—form. 
Apex—form. 
Two systems of scoring results were used in all the 
tests, one, the percentage grade system, the other, the 
point system. In scoring under the percentage grade CR te So Se Ey oO
-P-A-G-E-117
TESTS 7 
system, a definite value was assigned to each of the parts 
of a complete answer. For example, in test 1, in which 
there are ten parts recognized, each one was given a value 
of 10, and the whole a value of 100. The relative dif- 
ficulty of each of the parts of the complete answer is not 
known. It would seem that one could establish the rela- 
tive difficulties of these parts only as a result of a long 
series of tests in which tabulation is made of the actual 
relative accomplishment of many pupils who have had 
all parts of each test. In certain tests the different parts 
of which obviously vary in difficulty, a difference was 
made in the numerical value assigned to each part. 
The difficulty in assigning a definite value to each part 
of a test does not necessarily vitiate the value of a 
test, since if all papers are scored faithfully upon any 
assumed value for each part, the relative positions of the 
different pupils whose work is scored is likely to be the 
same as if other assumed values had been assigned. 
However, the assigning of definite percentage scores to 
parts of tests when the relative difficulties of these 
parts are unknown gives an unjustified appearance of 
accuracy and may be misleading. The percentage 
scores are not presented, therefore, but the method used 
in presenting the pupils’ standing in all the tests is desig- 
nated as the point system. The points used as the basis 
of the percentage grading are used as the basis of this 
system, but the system is planned for the purpose of 
avoiding the assignment of definite numerical percentage 
values to each part of the tests. A reasonably satis-
-P-A-G-E-118
  72 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
factory answer to one point is given a “+” mark; an 
answer which misses the point, or a failure to answer is 
given a “—” mark. An answer which contains some 
merit but which is lacking in important features is 
given the intermediate mark “‘y.” The point system of 
scoring makes it possible to show whether a pupil did or 
did not observe or interpret the points in question with- 
out undertaking to state the relative difficulties of the 
different observations or interpretations. When re- 
turns from a large number of pupils have been secured, 
it may be possible in connection with studies elsewhere 
to assign numerical values to the different elements of the 
tests used. 
A few representative answers are given below in order 
to indicate the nature of the responses. The pupil 
numbers here used bear no relation to the pupils’ ranking, 
each pupil having been assigned a number which is used 
for that pupil in all tests. The grade and score in 
number of points answered satisfactorily are also given. 
In test 1, a complete answer included ten points as the 
responses were analyzed. In printing the pupil’s answers 
no corrections have been made in sentence structure, 
spelling, or terms used. Replies have been selected from 
each of the four schools in which the tests were given.

include the time used in filling in blanks which 
ask for personal information. 
4. The topic headings of all points, ten in all in this 
test, are given and the pupil’s +, y, or — score 
isindicated below. At the right is the summary 
of individual scores. 
5. The scoring is first given for the boys in the class, 
then for the girls, then a summary of boys and 
girls combined. 
Pupil No. 28, for example, answered four points satis- 
factorily, partially answered two, and did not respond 
or gave incorrect responses on four points. If this 
pupil’s two partial answers or “‘y” scores are each 
scored as half-correct and these added to her + scores, 
she would have a score equal to satisfactory answers to 
one-half the whole number of points. Her score is + 4, 
y 2,—4, or if the y scores are combined with the + and   
1See page 76a.

— scores, the whole would be + 5,—5. Similarly pupil 
number 29, who made a most favorable score, is repre- 
sented as + 9, —1, but in this case none of the ++ scores 
is due to redistribution of y scores. If pupil number 14 
is compared with pupil number 31, it is seen that their 
respective scores are + 5, yo, —5;and+ 4,y 2,—4. By 
redistributing the y score of number 31 the whole score for 
pupil number 31 would read exactly as the score of pupil 
number 14. Since it is decidedly questionable whether 
two indefinite, though partially correct answers, are 
really equal to one clearly satisfactory answer, the y 
scores are not regularly combined with the + scores, 
but are summarized separately. 
It is also shown in Chart I that the mean number of 
replies for the 9 boys who were present when the test 
was given is +4.1, y 1.7,—4.1; and for the 16 girls who 
were present is + 5.0, y0.6,—4.3. The girls in this class 
on this test not only made a higher mean + score than 
the boys, but made a lower y score, and almost the same 
— score. 
In the summary the distribution of the class upon the 
basis of the + scores is given. The low score is 1, the 
high score 9, the mean 4.6. Fifteen of the pupils (6 boys 
and 9 girls) are below and 10 (3 boys and 7 girls) above 
the mean. 
Study of the vertical columns of pupil scores shows that 
there is a wide range between the value of responses on 
different points. Points 2, 5 and 7 when combined re- 
ceived more + answers than all the other 7 points com-

bined. This is interpreted as meaning that the other 7 
points are more difficult than points 2, 5 and 7, and that 
a-+t or y reply on one of these 7 points is of more value 
proportionately than similar answers on points 2, 5, and 7. 
In order to study the results obtained through giving 
the nine science tests to six elementary grades and two 
high school classes at Gary, summaries were made of 
each test for all the schools, and for each class and for 
each school upon all the nine tests. These and other 
similar studies resulted in the construction of more than 
ninety charts which classify and depict the results in 
detail. It would be useless to include in this volume all 
this material. Instead there is presented in connection 
with the description of test 1 a sample detailed class 
chart; there is then presented in Chart II a summary of 
the elementary school classes which shows the distribu- 
tion of the total scores for each class. 
A study of the returns from six classes? in four schools 
shows that 116 of the 150 pupils made satisfactory obser- 
vations regarding the distinctions between leaf margins. 
In addition to these 116 satisfactory observations, 26 
others made partially satisfactory answers on this point. 
On the other hand, but 9 satisfactory reports of the 150 
were made regarding the distinction between the sur- 
faces of the leaves, and but 4 partially satisfactory re- 
ports were made upon this point. Similarly 104 satis- 
1As stated above, only + replies. are shown in this table. Other data 
appear in unpublished charts. 
See Chart II, page 78a.

factory records were obtained regarding veins and 26 
additional partially satisfactory records; while the dis- 
tinction that the elm leaf has a ‘“‘lop-sided” base and the 
oak does not, received g satisfactory records and 8 
partially satisfactory ones. 
In Chart II,1 a summary of scores on test 1 for six 
elementary classes, it will be noted that the Beveridge 
class is presented separately since it was a seventh grade 
class. In this, as in most of the other tests, the Beveridge 
seventh grade class has a lower score than the eighth 
grade classes in the other schools. The class is not only 
one year less advanced but the principal of the school 
stated that this class had had little elementary science 
work since the primary grades. 
The chart also shows: 
a. Each point receives responses from some of the pupils. 
b. Points 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 receive a very consider- 
able number of correct responses, almost one-third of 
the pupils reply correctly on points 6 and 10, but only 
one pupil in 16 replies correctly on points 4 and 9. 
c. The number of y replies averages 1.1 for the 150 
pupils. 
d. The summary of individual pupil plus scores in each 
class shows the low score in each class was 1, the highest 
score was 9, but in all classes but one, the high score was 
6. Thirty-eight boys and 34 girls are below their class 
mean, while 27 boys and 51 girls are above their class 
mean.

e. The boys have a lower mean score than girls in 
their own classes in all schools except the Beveridge, in 
which boys and girls have the same + score and show 
only insignificant differences in their other scores, except 
that there are 10 girls and 6 boys below the mean. 
TEST NUMBER 2 
The preceding rather complete description of test 
number 1 will make it possible to present more briefly 
the essential features and results of the remaining tests. 
Different classes are selected for the different sample class 
charts in order to show the class variations. 
Test number 2 was designed to test ability to make 
comparisons by use of materials! which are seemingly 
more alike than those used in test 1, though the ma- 
terials really include points similar to those of test num- 
ber 1. On page 80 is a copy of the test blank. 
The following sample answers quoted from pupils’ 
papers will indicate the nature of the reactions given:

seven, while the red oak has five orso. The red oak is a much darker 
green. It is also longer than the red oak. The veins on both go to

TESTS 83 
parison of the final summaries of all classes on the two 
tests it is seen that there are important differences in the 
returns. Chart III shows: 
a. Points 2, 5, and 7 again elicit the larger number of 
successful replies in the individual class chart; and point 
3, which received a fairly correct reply in test 1, has a 
higher score, in consequence probably of a somewhat 
more striking difference in leaf color in test 2, as compared 
with test 1. 
b. The number of y replies by both boys and girls is 
less than in test 1, the girls’ y score still being below that 
of the boys. The average y score for the whole 148 pupils 
is 0.6 as compared with 1.1 in test 1. 
c. Since the mean + score is 3.5 as compared with 
3.7 in test 1, and the y score is 0.6 compared with 1.1, itis 
evident that the total correct response in test 2 is con- 
siderably below test 1, as would be expected from the pre- 
sumably increased difficulty of the comparisons called for. 
d. A study of the summary of individual pupil + 
scores in each class shows individual scores of wide range, 
from o to 6, with 35 boys and 41 girls below their class 
mean and 29 boys and 43 girls above their class mean. 
Since in tests 1 and 2 certain of the points involved are 
of such difficulty that but few pupils record the requisite 
observation, and since on all 10 points there are favorable 
average responses of almost four points per pupil, it is 
clear that ability to observe and record observation 
of the objects has actually been measured by these two 
tests.

TEST NUMBER 4! 
Tests 4 and 5 were used for the same purpose as 1 and 2 
but were based upon uniformly colored pictures of birds. 
In tests 1 and 2 the white oak leaf was common to both 
tests. In4and 5 the picture of the kingbird is common 
to both. In 4 the kingbird is contrasted with the strik- 
ingly different picture of the kingfisher, and in 5 the 
contrast is between the kingbird and the apparently 
similar but really quite distinctive crested flycatcher. 
The blank used in test 4 appears on page 85. 
The following are sample answers on test 4: 
Jefferson Class No. 18 
Purim No. 22. 
“The breast of the Kingbird is white. The throat is white. 
The crest has a small red mark on it. The back is brown. The tail 
is brown & the feathers have white ends. The wings seem to be 
shorter than those of the Kingfisher. The breast of the Kingfisher 
has a yellow band across it & brown streaks on either side of the 
breast. The throat of the Kingfisher has a gray blue band below it. 
The crest of the Kingfisher is large and upstanding, its color is gray 
blue. The back is bluish gray. The tail is grayish blue. The bill 
is longer than that of the Kingbird. The Kingfisher has a white 
spot near its eye.”

  88 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
In reading scores based upon 12 points instead of 10, 
as in tests 1 and 2, care must be used to avoid thinking 
of a score in this test as strictly comparable with those 
previously discussed. 
In Chart IV' the Beveridge seventh grade class is used 
for individual pupil illustrations and below it there appear 
the summaries and the distributions of individual class 
scores. ‘The chart shows: 
a. Certain points are observed and recorded by most 
of the pupils. Thus 29 of the 31 Beveridge pupils record 
the distinctive characters of the crowns of the two birds, 
and 139 of the total 172 pupils make these distinctions. 
On point 1, the beak, 21 of the 31 Beveridge pupils give 
satisfactory replies, as do 145 of the total 172. Similarly, 
satisfactory replies are given on points 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10. 
b. Points 4 and 12 are recorded only by most careful 
observers. For example, pupil number 34, Beveridge 
class, one of the four high pupils in the class, is the only 
one of the whole Beveridge class to respond correctly 
on point 12. 
c. The boys of the Beveridge as well as in all the 
schools make scores as good as those of the girls. The 
girls have the widest range of scores. 
d. The individual class distributions show a range in 
scores from o to 10, with 30 boys and 47 girls below their 
class mean, and 46 boys and 47 girls above their class 
mean.

Emerson class 14 is used for detailed illustration, and sum- 
maries of other classes are also given. Chart V shows: 
a. Certain points are observed by nearly all pupils, 
and the color of the bird’s breast is observed and recorded 
by all pupils in Emerson class 14 and by 163 of the 
1See page 92a.
-P-A-G-E-148
  92 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
total 168 pupils who took this test. Tail markings are 
observed by all but 3 Emerson class 14 pupils and by 159 
of the total 168. The distinctive crown markings are 
recorded by 33 of the 39 Emerson class 14 pupils and by. 
152 of the total 168 pupils. 
b. Only 16 of the 168 pupils record observations regard- 
ing differences in the form of the feet of the two birds. 
c. The very low score for ‘“‘y” or indefinite records 
is notable, since apparently a point when observed at all 
could easily be formulated correctly and clearly. 
d. Pupils who observe and record the most dif- 
ficult points, such as numbers 4, 5, and 6, are generally 
pupils who make a high score on other points, indicating 
that the less frequently answered points are really the 
more severe tests and thus serve to differentiate the better 
from poorer pupils. 
e. In the summary of individual pupil + scores in each 
class, it is noted that the girls slightly excel the boys, 
though both boys and girls make favorable records. 
SUMMARY OF TESTS ON OBSERVATION AND DISCRIMINATION 
OF LIKENESSES AND DIFFERENCES 
Tests 1, 2, 4, and 5 all bear directly upon ability in 
observation and discrimination. Study of records from 
these tests shows a considerable number of satisfactory 
responses, which are fairly uniform in their nature so far 
as facts reported are concerned. A comparison of the 
mean results of the four tests is made in the following

These mean scores are made up of so many elements 
that the figures cannot be interpreted as being anything 
more than a general statement, but they show possession 
of the types of abilities in question so far as they relate 
to the particular objects used in the tests. 
From the charts which give the summaries of the six 
classes on each of the four tests the girls are seen to score 
a little higher than the boys in most cases. The pupils 
in the Beveridge seventh grade class and the Jefferson 
eighth grade class reported that they have had nocon- 
siderable instruction in science. Notwithstanding these 
facts the Beveridge seventh grade pupils are close to the 
other classes in their scores on two of the tests and below 
them on two others. The Jefferson class leads in its 
average score on three of the four tests and is second on 
the other one. Undoubtedly elements other than pre- 
vious training in science enter into the ability of the 
Jefferson pupils as well as others who took the tests. 
TEST NUMBER 3! 
Tests numbers 3, 6, and 7 were planned to give a check 
on pupils’ abilities to recall past experiences in nature 
See note on page 84.  
-P-A-G-E-152
94 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
studies or elementary science and to use these expe- 
riences in similar or new situations. Practically all 
elementary instruction in science deals at some time 
with identification of common birds, with the nesting 
habits of birds, and with the life habits of some of the 
more common insects. 
In test 3 eight pictures of birds (instead of 10 as indi- 
cated on the test blank) were used. These pictures, 
which are uniform and of the best colored prints avail- 
able, are of the robin, flicker, bluejay, meadowlark, 
kingfisher, bluebird, kingbird, oriole. All these birds 
are found at some time of the year in and about the city 
of Gary. The test blank is given on page 95. 
Since this test called only for the common names of 
the eight birds as shown in the pictures, no sample 
answers need be presented. It should be said that no 
pupil named all the birds correctly, and that names of 
several birds other than those whose pictures were shown 
were given. 
In Chart VI! Emerson class 14 is selected for detailed 
study because of the fact that the scores of the boys in 
this grade are so strikingly different from those of the 
girls. It is evident that most scores were reduced by 
the fact that the pupils called the flicker a woodpecker, 
a not wholly incorrect name since it is sometimes improp- 
erly so called. Few of the pupils knew the kingbird or 
the meadowlark. 
The mean score for the boys is + 4.4, y 1.0,— 2.5;

and for the girls the mean is + 2.8, y 1.0, — 4.0. In this 
class 4 boys and 14 girls are below the mean; while 12 
boys and 8 girls are above the mean. Of all the classes 
26 boys and 46 girls are below their class mean, and 
42 boys and 309 girls are above their class mean. The 
boys excel the girls in this test in all but one class, Froebel 
45, and equal the girls in that class. 
As shown in the individual scores of Emerson class 
14, most pupils recalled having seen the birds whose pic- 
tures were used, and a good many recalled having used 
the birds in class studies. Since this test was based 
upon ability to recall names of things seen, it is important 
to associate the test with 6 and 7, in which processes, 
experience or uses of information are also called for. 
TEST NUMBER 6 
Tn test 6 ten common birds are named and the pupils 
_are asked to select any four from this group and to an- 
swer questions about them. Four questions were asked 
about each bird for the purpose of discovering the ex-

TESTS 99 
In test 6 it was not expected that pupils would give 
detailed descriptions of the materials of which nests were 
constructed, nor that they would give long lists of ma- 
terials which are fed to the young birds. Any definite 
and correct statement is accepted as worthy of a full score 
even though it might have been possible to make a more 
detailed statement. 
In Chart VII! Froebel class 45 is used as a sample 
illustration of detailed scoring. Near the right hand 
end of the chart the names of all the birds are given and 
the particular four selected by each pupil for his test 
are indieated by check marks. The first group of points 
I, 2, 3, 4 provides for answers upon all four questions 
for the first bird, the second 1, 2, 3, 4 for the second bird, 
etc., until all 16 points are provided for. Each bird in 
the list was chosen, but those chiefly chosen in all classes 
were the robin, red-headed woodpecker, and the English 
sparrow, though others, such as the crow, bluebird, oriole, 
and wren were chosen by almost one-third of all pupils. 
This shows a fairly wide range of information about most 
of the birds listed. 
In Froebel class 45, used for detailed individual illus- 
tration, the boys’ mean score is + 7.1, y 8.0, —0.8, with a 
low score of 3 and a high score of 13. The girls have 
a mean score of + 7.5, y 7.1, — 1.2, with a low score 
of 5 and a high score of 12. The summary of in- 
dividual pupil + scores in each class shows a range 
from o to 14, there being 27 boys and 53 girls-below 
1See page 98a.  
-P-A-G-E-162
100 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the class mean, and 43 boys and 38 girls above the class 
mean. 
The four questions asked about each bird called for 
somewhat different types of information. In considera- 
tion of this fact it is notable that of a total of 164 pupils 
who took this test no question received less than 31 satis- 
factory replies and 109 satisfactory replies were given to 
one question and gz to another. 
TEST NUMBER 7 
In this test, which is similar in purpose to number 6, 
the names of ten common insects are given. From this 
list pupils are asked to select four, about each of which 
they are to answer four questions. The test blank 
is on page or. 
The following are sample answers on test 7:

Grade 7, Score + 6,y 7,—3 
A study of the Jefferson sample individual class scores 
given in Chart VIII! shows that the element of indefinite- 
ness or failure is much more common in the results of this 
test than in other tests. Out of a possible score of 16, 
the mean class score is 4.1, y 6.2, 5.6. The summaries 
of scores on each point given for all other classes shows a 
similar proportion of indefiniteness and failure in other 
classes. In but one point, the habitat of insects, did 
the 166 pupils make a score above 100, this being on 
the insect first chosen. Thesummary of individual pupil 
+ scores in each class shows a range in scores from o to 
12, with 35 boys and 52 girls below the class mean, and 
40 boys and 39 girls above the class mean. The insects 
chiefly chosen for discussion were the housefly and 
mosquito. 
SUMMARY OF RESULTS IN TESTS 3, 6, AND 7 
When results from tests 3, 6, and 7 dealing with recol- 
lection and use of previous experiences are compared 
with tests 1, 2, 4, and 5, which deal with observation and 
discrimination, it appears that pupils in their responses 
to these tests make less satisfactory responses on the sec- 
ond group than on the first. The amount of response 
1See page 102a.

is large enough, however, to show a considerable knowl- 
edge of the questions asked in these particular tests. 
TEST NUMBER 8 
Tests 8 and 9 were planned to discover the extent of 
abilities in interpretation of phenomena which change 
under the observation of the pupils. The test blank 
and the accompanying photograph! of the apparatus 
used in test 8 show that a large candle (or three candles) 
is lighted and placed in the glass faced box, which is then 
closed with the exception of two openings—one directly 
above the flame and the other in the end of the box oppo- 
site the flame. A piece of punk or bundle of Chinese 
incense sticks is lighted and placed near the end open- 
ing in the box. Part of the smoke from the punk moves 
first through the end opening of the box into the box, 
then through the box and out at the opening above the 
flame. The pupils are asked to state what was done 
in the performance of the experiment, what movements 
of smoke occurred, and to explain what caused the smoke 
to move through the box. The test blank is on page 105. 
The following are sample answers on test 8: 
Jefferson Class No. 18. 
Purrt No. 8. 
“(z) First we lighted the punk or smoking coal and placed it by 
the hole in the side of the box. Then we lighted the candals and 
closed the box. we put the glass tube over the chimney. (2) Some 
of the smoke that the smoking coal made rushed into the glass 
box while the other part rushed to the ceiling. The smoke that 
the candals made went through the chimney at the top. (3) When

Although this is not a test of speed, it is important to record the time of beginning and of closing 
your work. After the experiment has been shown you, and when told to do so, enter the exact 
time in hours and minutes in the first time blank; then do the work requested; and then enter the 
  time of finishing.

  In the experiment we shall use a glass-faced box, a lamp flue, a lighted candle, and a smoking 
piece of punk. After carefully observing what happens, you are asked to make three statements: 
What was done? What movements of smoke occurred? What made the smoke move as it did? 
Answer the questions below: 
1. What was done?....

the box was closed the candals heated the air causing it to expand 
and grow lighter and thus rising to the ceiling carrying the hot smoke 
with it. When the air in the box rose to the ceiling through the 
chimney the fresh or cold air on the outside of the box rushed in 
through the hole in the side of the box to take the place of the hot 
air. Thus taking the smoke from the punk with it. Winds are 
caused by the same principal.”

“(z) We lit the smoking coal and then the candles and closed the 
box. and put a glass chimney on the opening on top. (2) The smoke 
from the punk was put at the opening and the smoke went in the box 
through the opening. (3) The air was use up by the candle and the 
smoke took the place of it then it when to the top and new air took 
it place that cause a suchtion.”

“first he took a lamp chimney and put it on the top of the box. 
Then he lit the punk and let the smoke go in through an empty 
space. Then he lit the three candles and closed the box. (2) 
The smoke went towards the burning light. It went eastward after 
it reach the burning candle it went out of the lamp chimney. (3) 
the burning candles make the smoke draw nearer to the flame be- 
cause a fire draws smoke because smoke is light & heat makes smoke 
follow it.”

“(z) Three candles were lighted in the box and some lighted punk

At first the smoke from the punk went up but when the candles were 
lighted the smoke passed through the opening into the glass box. 
Some of the smoke would go up (3) The candles heated the air and

the smoke went through the opening.” 
Grade 8, Score + 11, y0,—7 
The points on which test 8 was scored are given below. 
Since it was desired to fix attention definitely upon the 
different parts of the apparatus so that the further state- 
ment of what occurred and the interpretation of what 
occurred might be as definite as possible, the pupils 
were asked in Part I to state what was done in the per- 
formance of the experiment, in Part II to state what 
occurred, and in Part III to explain results. The records 
were thus divided into three parts in order to assist in 
securing definiteness in responses. If statements which 
belong under one part appeared under another part they 
were accepted. The list of points used in scoring was 
made up not only from the points which were expected 
in a complete answer, but after a careful study of the 
responses actually given by pupils. There is evidently 
wide range in the relative value of the different points 
used in the scoring. Also there is some overlapping of 
points, as, for example, in point 18, the idea of which 
would often be included elsewhere; but this was dis- 
tinctly mentioned in a few cases and was therefore in- 
cluded as one of the points scored.

Door of box was closed. 
Punk was lighted. 
Punk was placed outside, in front of lower hole. 
Chimney was placed on outside, above candles. 
Part II. What happened 
A part of the smoke went around the box into the 
room. 
A part of the smoke went into the box through the 
hole. 
This passed through (or across) the box. 
A part of this smoke passed up the chimney. 
The smoke from the candles passed up the chim- 
ney. 
Pari III. Explanation of Results 
Oxygen of the air caused candles to burn. 
The air above the flame became heated. 
Air, when heated, expands and becomes lighter. 
The lighter air rises. 
Cooler air comes in through the hole at the bot- 
tom, crowds the lighter air upward, and thus 
takes the place of the lighter air. 
With this current the smoke*from the punk is 
carried. 
The smoke becomes heated and most of it rises 
through the chimney. 
The answer “The draft caused the smoke to move in” 
has been credited under point 16.

  TESTS tog 
The individual scores of Froebel class 46 given in 
Chart IX! show that one or more pupils responded on 
each of the eighteen points, though on point 14 there 
is no + score and but one y score. This shows that, 
while point 14 is important as a fact in interpretation of 
occurrences in the test, it is practically negative so far 
as this particular class is concerned. ‘This is almost 
equally true of points 11, 12, 15, and 18. A study of 
the summaries of other classes presented in the lower part 
of Chart IX shows similarly low returns in other classes 
on points 14, 15, and 18. In the individual class chart 
record it is interesting to note that, of the 20 pupils 
present when this test was given, all have + scores on 
point 1, 19 have + scores on points 2 and 8, and 18 have 
+ scores on points 4and5. The summaries of all classes 
show relatively high returns on points 1, 2, 4, 5,and 8, 
there being 160 or more scores on each of these points 
from the 168 pupils. 
The individual pupil summaries for Froebel class 46 
show pupil scores ranging from + 3, y 6, — 9g and + 4, 
y2,—12, to +11,y1,—6 and +11,y0,—7. The 
class mean score is + 8.1, y 1.6,— 8.2. The summary 
of individual pupil + scores in each class shows a range 
in scores from 3 to 17, there being 41 boys and 45 girls 
below their class mean and 36 boys and 46 girls above 
their class mean. 
The Jefferson class has a strikingly high score, a class 
mean of +10.2, y 0.9, —6.8. This class, as previously 
See page 108a.  
-P-A-G-E-178
  110 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
indicated, has a much more regular school program as a 
whole, without any of the elementary science courses 
which are given in the grades by high school teachers in 
the Froebel and Emerson schools. 
Referring again to the summaries of scores of all the 
classes, it is seen that the high scores, as would be ex- 
pected, are chiefly on the points under Part I, which 
called for statement of what was done. Good scores also 
appear under Part II, which called for statement of 
what occurred, but low scores appear in Part III where 
interpretation was called for. 
TEST NUMBER 9 
This test,! as in test 8, is divided into three parts, but 
the different parts are not comparable to those of 8, 
since in g, each part calls for interpretation of occur- 
rences, as is indicated in the test blank on page 111. 
The following are sample answers on test 9: 
Jefferson Class No. 18. 
Purr No. 23.

would not let the air out. (3) The cork let some of the air out—and 
the water rushed in to take its place.”

In the experiment we shall use a tall glass jar, a funnel, a glass of water, and a rubber stopper. 
We shall perform the experiment in three parts, after which you are to answer the questions below: 
1. When the water was first poured into the funnel, why did it flow down into the tall glass jar?. . . 
  2. After the funnel was inserted into the cork, the cork placed in the jar, and the water poured into 
the funnel, why did not the water flow down into the tall glass jar?. 
    3. When the cork was slightly withdrawn the water began running down and continued running, 
then stopping, then running and stopping in the same way until all the water had run down. 
What caused the water to act in this way?.

chance to flow in. (2) The water did not flow into the jar because 
it was stoped up by the air that was in the jar, because it couldn’t

The list of points on which pupils are scored is as

POINTS CONSIDERED IN GRADING TEST NO. 9 
Pari I 
1.. “Gravity” or “weight of water” causes it to run 
down the tube. 
2. Pressure of water downward is greater than that 
of air upward, or pressure of water and air 
downward is greater than that of air upward.

II.

  TESTS 113 
The air is forced out of the jar by the water. 
Some relation to air—miscellaneous answers in 
addition to above. 
Part IT 
The jar is already filled with air. 
The stopper prevents this air from escaping. 
The upward pressure is sufficient to hold up the 
water. 
Two things cannot occupy the same space at the 
same time, or, the water could not enter be- 
cause it could not force the air out. 
Part III 
The inside air pressure is reduced. 
A little water enters. 
The force of the entering water compresses the 
air in the flask so that the pressure inside and 
outside are again unequal. 
A few bubbles of air escape until pressure is re- 
duced. 
More water enters, and the process is repeated 
until the water has all entered. 
In Chart X" the individual class records of Emerson 
class 15 are presented as illustrations. There is a wide 
range in the value of different points as is shown by the 
fact that on point 4, 28 of the 35 pupils who took this 
test have + scores; while on point 11 no pupil in this class   
See page 114a. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  114 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
made either a+ or ay score. Also it is shown by the 
totals from all classes at the bottom of the chart that no 
one made a-++ score on points 11 or 12, and only 13 and 12 
made y scores. Notwithstanding the low return on these 
points, it still seems wise to retain them in scoring since 
the ideas of these points are involved in a thorough ex- 
planation of what occurred in the experiment. 
The scores of individual pupils in Emerson class 15 
range from that of pupil number 29 who gave no answer 
of merit, to pupils numbered 6 and 7 whose scores re- 
spectively are + 7, yo, —6, and + 7, y2,—4. Only 
9 of the 35 pupils made scores of + 5 and more, and the 
mean score for the whole class is + 2.2, y 0.4, — 10.2. 
However, the boys made markedly better scores than 
the girls, only 2 of the 18 girls making scores better than 
+1. Astudy of the summaries of all classes shows that 
the class average scores range from the Beveridge seventh 
grade, which, as stated, had received no science instruction 
and has a mean score of + 0.8, y 0.1, — 12.0, to Froebel 
45 with a mean class score of + 4.5, y 1.0,— 7.4. The 
summary of individual pupil + scores in each class shows 
that they range from o to 9g, with 28 boys and 64 girls 
below their class mean, and 51 boys and 31 girls above 
their class mean. 
The individual scores of Emerson class 15 as well as the 
total scores of all classes show that Part I of the test 
received the largest satisfactory response and Part IT 
and Part III almost the same amount of satisfactory 
response. However, in Part I, point 4, which was a mis-

cellaneous category, received more satisfactory replies 
than any other point.! 
SUMMARY OF TESTS 8 AND 9 
The individual and class scores on points which in- 
volve interpretation are much less favorable than were 
those which involve observation of objective phenomena, 
and recall of previous experiences. This result was of 
course to be expected since interpretation is much the 
more difficult process. Again, tests 8 and g are more 
difficult than tests 1 to 7, so that the lower scores in the 
former set do not necessarily indicate less ability. The 
inferiority in scores of girls to boys on tests 8 and 9 may 
possibly be correlated with the fact that in the Emerson 
and Froebel schools the boys were said to have had more 
instruction in elementary physical science and the girls 
more in household sciences. This explanation would 
not, however, apply to the Beveridge and Jefferson 
schools where no courses in elementary physical science 
had been taken by any of the pupils; yet in these schools 
the scores made by girls are lower than those made by 
boys just as in the Emerson and Froebel schools. The 
scores on test 9 of the Beveridge seventh grade class are 
low as compared with those of eighth grades in other 
schools. On test 8, however, the Beveridge seventh 
grade made a quite favorable showing as compared with 
the other schools. Tests 8 and g differ from one another   
1This fact shows the need of a further refinement of the system of 
scoring these responses. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  116 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
in difficulty and the two tests together differ in difficulty 
from the other seven, and are of quite different na- 
ture. It is clear, however, that pupils in these schools 
show no marked ability to reply satisfactorily to tests 
8 and 9. 
RECORDS OF EACH CLASS ON ALL TESTS 
Charts have been prepared by means of which to de- 
termine the relative standing of each class on all of the 
g tests, and also charts which show the comparative re- 
sponse of all the six classes upon each of the g tests. 
These charts show considerable variation in the relative 
performances of the different classes. The Jefferson class 
has the {highest mean score on 5 of the g tests; and the 
Beveridge seventh grade class has the lowest mean score 
on one of the 9g tests and ties for lowest on tests 1 and 2. 
The greatest divergence appears in the classes in the Froe- 
bel school. Five of the nine lowest mean class scores ap- 
pear in one or another of these two classes, and three of 
the highest class means appear in a Froebel class. In 
tests 4, 6, and 9 Froebel class 45 ranks highest. It ranks 
lowest in tests 5and 7 and ties for lowest on1rand2. The 
irregularity of attendance in Froebel class 45 undoubt- 
edly helps to explain the scores, since, on the day when 
test 9 was given, 6 of the 18 pupils were absent; two were 
absent when test.4 was given and 4 when test 5 was given. 
When test 7 was given there were 5 pupils absent, but 
they were not the same pupils who were absent when 
tests 4, 5,and g were given. Five of the six pupils who 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  
TESTS ‘17 
were absent when test 8 was given were present when test 
7 was given and these 5 made very low scores on test 7. 
The rankings of the 6 classes on all nine tests are in the 
following order: Jefferson, Emerson 14, Froebel 45, 
Froebel 46, Emerson 15, Beveridge. 
The tests when grouped according to the chief purpose 
for which they were devised, it is repeated, are 1, 2, 
4, 5 to discover abilities in observation and discrimina- 
tion; 3, 6, and 7 to discover abilities to recall and use 
previous information and experiences; 8 and g to discover 
abilities to see what occurs and to interpret or give rea- 
sons for these occurrences. Summaries of scores grouped 
under these three headings show that on these particu- 
lar tests the classes tested have highest rank on the 
second group; next highest on the first group, and lowest 
on the third. i 
The results secured by the tests are, as has already 
been stated, not wholly due to school work in science; 
they are affected by all the other influences, in school 
and out, to which children are subjected. Nevertheless, 
they would undoubtedly be better if the school work in 
science were more clearly planned and more efficiently 
conducted. On the basis of facilities provided, the Jef- 
ferson school should rank distinctly lower than Emerson 
and Froebel; but the superiority of Jefferson in 
its greater regularity of procedure and definiteness’ of 
program and purpose more than compensate for its in- 
ferior plant.. If the Jefferson pupils could enjoy the 
Froebel and Emerson opportunities without losing their
-P-A-G-E-190
118 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
present advantages they would probably show still better 
results. They are not now better because of their limita- 
tions, but because the school makes better use of what it 
has. 
The tests which were given to the last grade of the 
elementary schools were also given to the senior high 
school classes in the Emerson and Froebel schools. The 
charts showing the detailed scores for each pupil on all 
the nine tests are not presented in this report, but the 
comparative class scores are given. In the summary given 
in Chart XI! the results from 66 senior high school pupils 
and 174 grade pupils are presented. The four observa- 
tion or discrimination tests are grouped together. In 
the same way the three tests on recall and use of informa- 
tion are grouped, and finally the two tests on interpreta- 
tion or reasoning. The scores for boys and for girls are 
given both separately and combined, It will be noted 
that the mean plus score for the high school pupils 
exceeds that of the elementary school pupils in almost 
all of the 36 combinations presented, and that in the 
6 cases where elementary classes score higher than high 
school classes, the difference is very slight in all but one 
case. In the observation and discrimination tests the 
elementary school girls slightly surpass the boys, and in 
these same tests the high school girls scored distinctly 
higher than the boys. In recall and use of information 
high school boys and girls had equal mean scores, while 
elementary school boys were markedly superior to the

girls. In the interpretation and reasoning tests the 
mean scores of the boys in both elementary and high 
school were distinctly higher than those of the girls. 
The total mean scores show throughout a higher score 
for high school pupils than for elementary school pupils. 
The difference is greatest in the last group of tests, 
i. e., those dealing with the more difficult matters of rea- 
soning. The high school pupils had all studied one or 
more sciences in the high school, but it is not possible 
from the data to determine the amount of high school 
science studied, since the questions asked did not differ- 
entiate high school and elementary school science. It is 
possible that some of the higher scores in the high school 
may be due to the fact that some pupils remaining to 
the senior year of the high school are persons of superior 
ability, but it is equally possible that pupils who do not 
remain to the senior year also possess superior ability. 
While it is not proved, therefore, that the higher scores 
of high school pupils on these tests are due to their high 
school science training, it is likely that this is true.

XI. PUPIL HELPERS IN SCIENCE WORK 
made to “pupil helpers,’ and since the “helper” 
plan is used in science quite freely, a word should be 
devoted to it in this connection. When a pupil from 
a lower class is assigned to work with a more advanced 
class he is known as a “helper.” When a pupil 
from a more advanced class works with a lower class he 
is known as an “assistant.” The theory of the helper 
plan, as has already been stated, is that a younger pupil 
learns something, and gains much stimulation, when he 
observes the work of older pupils. Teachers usually 
underestimate the amount of real understanding which 
immature pupils may secure of work ordinarily consid- 
ered too advanced for them. Such work may also arouse 
desire for further study. Adults who have been pupils 
in district schools often testify to the amount of infor- 
mation and interest gained by them through listening 
to the recitations and discussions of older pupils. It 
seems likely that with our modern definite classifications 
and separately taught classes we may lose much that 
might be gained through contact with older pupils. The 
helper plan is designed partly to supply this need and 
no doubt has value. [: THE preceding account frequent reference has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
122 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
But to be of real educative use, helpers should not be 
merely kept in the same room with the older class, but 
should have some opportunity to participate, if no more 
‘than enough to avoid the deadening effect of sitting idle 
for a whole period in a room where no obligation or re- 
sponsibility rests upon them. In case of some kinds of 
shop work, science laboratory work, or garden and poul- 
try work, the helpers should be kept engaged as real 
helpers to pupils who are primarily responsible for the 
work in hand. Ina system of duplicate classes the need 
of disposing of some pupils for one or more periods some- 
times leads to the abuse of the helper plan by assigning 
pupils day after day as helpers in classes where they do 
no more than sit or wander about the room idly until 
the close of the assigned periods. The most serious 
danger of the system is that it may foster a habit of care- 
lessness, of time wasting, of irresponsibility. There is 
abundant evidence that this danger is not always avoided. 
The benefits of the plan, now only occasional, could be 
more frequently secured, if pupils were assigned as help- 
ers only at times and in places where they may really 
learn something and really help; at all other times they 
should be profitably engaged elsewhere.

XII. CONCLUSION 
‘ N JE HAVE stated that science is still in most 
schools grudgingly treated in the way of time, 
facilities, and supervision, and that science 
materials make too feeble an appeal to children largely 
‘because they lack concreteness. Gary has been com- 
paratively generous in giving time and providing equip- 
ment, and has thus explicitly stamped the subject as 
important. 
It is, however, quite impossible to -characterize the 
instruction in general terms. Here and there—notably 
in some of the high school grades of the Emerson school— 
it was good, that is, the instructor pursued an orderly 
plan in choosing and arranging material and constantly 
sought to show the way in which science principles and 
science knowledge are used in the affairs of modern so- 
ciety. The pupils were interested, but they were more 
than interested—they were being trained to think and 
act effectively. The teaching of botany and gardening 
at the Froebel school was in a high degree intelligent and 
effective; while not deficient in scientific order, it never- 
theless kept in close contact with the facts and needs of 
life. Elsewhere, however, the instruction was too fre- 
quently formless and aimless. It had often abandoned 
123  
-P-A-G-E-196
  
124 THE GARY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the safe though usually dispiriting support of the text- 
book, without finding other safe plan or guidance, and 
was often less effective than conventional work would 
have been. 
The lack of continuity and of organizing purpose to 
which attention has been frequently directed is fatal to 
good work. Even science teaching of conventional type 
cannot run itself; still less so, science teaching which 
abandons the beaten path. Supervision and staff organ- 
ization, necessary under ordinary circumstances, need 
to be more efficient and more intelligent, if they are also 
to be more flexible, as under the conditions that obtain 
at Gary. But Gary’s science supervision is nominal and 
its staff conferences far too rare to answer their purpose. 
Under such circumstances, conventional teaching would 
be unlikely to be good of its kind; and a large experi- 
mental undertaking when so conducted is likely to have 
an unsatisfactory result. 
Gary has, however, shown courage and resource- 
fulness in trying to free science teaching from its remote 
and abstract character, in trying to bring it into touch 
with the pupil’s experience and to relate it to his other 
school work. Teachers of English and teachers of sci- 
ence attack a large problem together; the shop and the 
laboratories are at times brought to bear on identical 
problems. This is excellent as far as it goes, and con- 
tains the foundation upon which a rational course in 
school science may ultimately be worked out. But it is 
not enough merely to break away from the formal, cut-
-P-A-G-E-197
CONCLUSION 125 
and-dried type of science teaching represented by most 
textbooks and to introduce concrete problems from time 
to time. Chaos follows unless aims have been sharply 
defined; unless orderly development of laws and princi- 
ples is assured through intelligent and forceful guidance; 
unless careful and exacting work is secured through 
competent teaching. Beyond a general and sound pre- 
dilection for the concrete as embodied in the environment 
and experience of the pupil, it is impossible to discern at 
Gary satisfactory principles of organization or progres- 
sion in science teaching. Unquestionably, the children 
are interested in their science work and derive pleasure 
from it, and to this end the work is of value. But 
science fulfills its educational mission, not simply by 
arousing interest in a disconnected series of phenomena 
or giving pleasure through a disconnected series of ex- 
periences, but by cultivating capacity to deal intel- 
ligently and vigorously with significant problems. This 
ought indeed to be both an interesting and a pleas- 
urable task; but unless it involves order, persistence, 
and hard work, its educative effect is probably of minor 
importance. Unless so presented, science is likely to be 
a transient diversion rather than a profoundly formative 
and truly disciplinary influence in the pupil’s develop- 
ment.

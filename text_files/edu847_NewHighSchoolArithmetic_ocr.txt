page 158, etc. The processes are clearly and striking 
in unique form in rules such as those on pages 30, | 
The model solutions set an example of clearness ax 
cannot fail to impress pupils and result in more accur:

important terms are printed in striking manner (page | 
fully indexed. There is provided for drill purposes a | 
of examples and problems (pp. 4, 6, 8, 89, 58, 235) + | 
the simple sensible sort met in real applications (7, |, . 
59, 63,103). These examples can and should often be done men-| 
tally, and will be found to be properly graded in difficulty in the! 
separate lists. Topics which are not strictly essential for all pupils} 
are plainly marked as supplementary. These topics are in some| 
cases interesting but not necessary (as Cube Root on page 142), 
and in other cases are important but can be included in a 
only when local conditions render it possible (as Topie A c: 
179). 
How much and what to include in the course in arithmetic in 
any particular community depends upon the previous preparation 
of the pupils, upon the special aims of the course, and u; 
time allowed for the study. In most cases some selection a 
as well as of examples and problems becomes necessary. 
Chapters I to V, excepting the Supplementary Topics, are a 
fundamental part of any course. An effort should be made, how- 
ever, to get over these chapters as speedily as is « 
the development of a reasonable amount of skill i: 
An abundance of drill has been provided, with 1 
that some of it will be done orally and some of it 1 
special assignments for those pupils who are weak i: 
Obviously it is not necessary that all the example: 
. should be solved by any one class. 
What use is made of Chapter VI will depend upon whether the

course in arithmetic precedes or follows the course in geometry. 
If it follows, then much of this chapter between pages 145 and 
168 should be omitted, although some of the problems should be 
solved. If time must be saved, pages 168 to197, and 205 to 207 
may also be omitted. If this chapter precedes the course in 
geometry, it will be found valuable preparation for that course.

I. INTEGERS 
1. Writing and Reading Integers in the Hindu System. — 
Pupils are familiar with the manner of writing and reading 
small Integers or whole numbers in the Hindu System by 
means of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, -», 9. 
Norz.— Our system of writing numbers is often improperly 
called the Arabic System. 
They should recall that a number like 2,643 is read “ two 
thousand, six hundred forty-three,” not “and forty-three.” 
EXERCISE 1 
Read 4,275; 3,560; 2,708; 6,029. 
What are the digits? 
Tell what each digit of the number 6,035 represents. 
4. In numbers like fourteen, what does the syllable 
“teen” mean ? 
5. In numbers like thirty, what does the syllable “ty” 
mean? 
enrp 
2. For convenience in reading integers, the digits of a 
number are divided into groups of three, starting from the 
right. Each group is called a Period. The first three figures 
form the units’ period; the second three, the thousands’ 
1
-P-A-G-E-9
2 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
period; the third three, the millions’ period; the fourth 
three, the billions’ period. 
Thus, 20,793,106,452 is read twenty Dillion, seven hundred ninety-| 
three million, one hundred six thousand, four hundred jifty-two. 
Nore. — The following table gives the names of each of the 
first fourteen periods. Only the first four of these periods are 
used in ordinary computation.

62d Cong., 1913-1914, appropriated $ 2,118,060,671.12 | 
68d Cong., 1915-1916, appropriated $ 2,231,055,150.57 
5. Read the following figures, which give the estimated 
value of the farm products of the United States in the years 
indicated. 
a. 1910, $9,037,390,744 d. 1913, $ 9,849,512,511 
b, 1911, $8,819,174,959 e, 1914, $ 9,894,960,531 
c, 1912, $9,342,790,149 Ff 1915, $10,501,686,375 
3. In the Roman System of writing integers the follow- 
ing symbols are used : Meas oe, 
I represents 1 C represents 100 
‘V represents 5 D represents 500 
X represents 10 M represents 1000 
L represents 50 
All other small integers are represented by writing two 
or more of these letters side by side, according to the follow- 
ing: 
Rule I.— If a letter follows one of the same or greater 
value, the number represented is the sum of their values. 
Rule II,—If a letter precedes one of greater value, the 
number represented is the difference between their values. 
Thus, XVIL=104+5+141=17. 
Thus, XC = 100 — 10 = 90. 
The Roman System of writing numbers is seldom used 
now except for numbering chapters in books, hours on a 
clock face, dates on buildings or monuments, and the vor 
umes of a set of books.

Addition of Integers 
4. The integers arranged in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., are 
said to form a Sequence. 
The Sum of two integers, like 3 and 5, is the fifth integer 
beyond 3 in the sequence of integers. 
Addition of Integers is the process of finding the sum when 
two or more integers are given. The integers added are 
called Addends. 
_ 5. Skillful addition depends upon accurate and rapid ree- 
ognition of the sums of the following pairs of integers. 
These are all the possible pairs of two digits, omitting the 
digit zero.

sary that all be done at this time or that every pupil do

low in adding should be required to practice on this drill daily 
til he can do the exercises skillfully. From time to time, a few 
inutes can be spent profitably upon oral drill based on this table. 
Do not copy the numbers from the book.

Subtraction of Integers 
7. In Subtraction, two numbers are given, the Subtrahend, 
and the Minuend. Subtraction is the process of finding the 
number, called the Difference, which must be added to the 
subtrahend to give the minuend. 
Thus, to subtract 8 from 12 means to find the number which 
must be added to 8 to give 12. This is 4. 
Subtraction is also thought of as a process of taking 
away and pupils are doubtless more familiar with it in that 
form. 
In actual business computations, both meanings of sub- 
traction find application. The following example illustrates 
a solution in accordance with the first meaning. 
Example 1.— Subtract 483 from 758. 
Think 84+5= 8 Write 5 in the units’ 
Minuend 58 Place. 
Subtnak i nS Think 8+7=15. Write 7 in the tens’ 
. ‘DFR Place. Difference 275 Think 1, carried, +}4=54+2=7. Write 
2 in the hundreds’ place. 
Check: The sum of the subtrahend and difference equals the 
minuend, 
Example 2.— Subtract 436 from 859 by the taking away 
method and explain the solution. 
Whatever the method used, skill in subtraction, like 
skill in addition, depends upon accurate and rapid recogni- 
tion of the difference between (a) any integer less than ten 
and a greater integer to ten inclusive, or (b) between any 
such integer and the integer formed by adding ten to a 
smaller integer.

Solution. —$1.63 and 2¢ = $1.65; $1.65 and 16 
$1.75 and 25¢ = $2.00; $2.00 and $2.00 = $4.00; 
$1.00 = $5.00. 
Hence the change consists of two pennies, a dime, 
$1.00 bill and a $2.00 bill; altogether $3.37. 
In practice, the procedure is as follows: 
$1.63 and 29 is $1.65; and 10¢ is $1.75; and 257 i: 
$2.00 is $4.00; and $1.00 is $5.00.

Multiplication of Integers 
9. In Multiplication, a Multiplier and a Multiplicand ar 
given, and a product is to be determined. 
The Multiplicand is the number multiplied ; th 
is the number by which the multiplicand is mult _ 
When the multiplier and multiplicand are integers, th 
product is obtained by using the multiplicand as an adden 
as many times as there are units in the multiplier. 
The symbol for multiplication is x. It will be rea 
“times” in this book. Hence 3x5 means 5+5+5 or 1i 
10. If a number of things of one kind be multiplied by 
an integer, the product is things of the same kind. 
Thus, 6 times 7 books is 42 books. 
It is agreed that the multiplier is always a pure or ab 
stract number. Thus 5 cannot be multiplied by 4 ft., no 
can 6 bu. be multiplied by 7 bu, 
      
   
   11. Parentheses, ( ), placed about two or mor 
which are connected by mathematical symbols, 1-.-- .— 
the result obtained by performing the computation withi 
the parentheses is to be treated as a single number in fu 
ther computation. 
Thus, a. 3 + (5+ 6) means that 5 + 6 or 11 is to be added to! 
b. 4 x (7 + 8) means that 7 + 8 or 15 is to be multiplied by 4. 
12. Three Fundamental Laws of Multiplication. 
a. Since 3x5=545+45=15, 
and 5 x 8=3+4+3+43+4343=15, 
clearly 3x 5=5 x 3.  
-P-A-G-E-32
| "INTEGERS 25 
| This is an illustration of 
The Commutative Law of Multiplication 
The multiplier and multiplicand in a product may be inter- 
changed without changing the value of the product. 
db Since (3 x 2) x5=6x5=30, 
and 3 x (2x 5)=3 x 10 =30, 
clearly (3 x 2) x 5=3 x (2 x 5). 
This is an illustration of 
The Associative Law of Multiplication 
To obtain the product of three integers, the third may be 
multiplied by the product of the first two, or the product of the 
last two may be multiplied by the first. 
c. Since 8 x (445) =3X 9 or 27, 
and (8 x 4) + (3 x 5) = 12 415 or 27, 
clearly 3 x (4+5) =.(8 x 4)+ (8 x 5). 
This is-an illustration of 
The Distributive Law of Multiplication 
To multiply the sum of two (or more) numbers by a number, 
ultiply each of them by the multiplier and add the products 
) obtained. \ 
Example 1. Bx (24447) =(6X2V4+GxX +5 x7) 
= 10420 435 
= 65. 
Another form of the distributive law is illustrated in the 
allowing example, 
Example 2. —8+ x4=(BXD)4(7x 4) 
=12428 
= 40.

19. In applications of division, two types o: 
occur. 
If any number of things of one kind be divided l 
number of things of the same kind, the quotient is a 
number. 
Example 1.— A train travels 35 miles an hour. In ho 
many hours will it travel 105 miles if it travels always 
the same rate? 
Solution. —1. 105 miles + 85 miles = 3. 
2. Hence it will take 3 hours, 
If any number of things of one kind be divide? * + 
abstract number, the quotient will be a number of thir. | 
same kind as the dividend. 
Example 2.—A train travels 120 miles in thre 
How far does it travel in one hour if it travels. 
at the same rate? 
Since it travels 120 miles in 3 hours, it will travel in one ho 
as many miles as 3 is contained times in 120, or 40 miles. 
120 + 3 = 40 miles. 
In applications of division, the remainder frequently ha 
no meaning and must be ignored. 
Example 3.— An autoist stopping to buy gasolin: | 
that he has just $1.67. If gasoline is selling for 22, 
gallon, how many gallons may he ask for? 
Solution. — $1.67 + $.22 = 7+. 
That is, he has enough money for 7 gallons, but sorte 
not enough for 8 gallons. He buys 7 gallons and 22/167 154 has 18 ¢ left over. 5 
This example illustrates one of the most common form 
in which division is used. The division is perform: ~

30. A. Proofs of the Rules of Divisibility. (Page 44) 
Proof of I.— A number whose last digit is 0 consists 
vided by 10. 
Thus, 560 consists of 56 tens, for 500 = 50 tens and 60 = 6 tens Hence any number ending in 0 ean be
-P-A-G-E-54
INTEGERS 47 
Proof of I1.—If a number ends in 0, it consists of a num- 
ber of tens. Each ten can be divided by 5. Hence the 
whole number can be divided by 5. 
Thus, 360 = 36 tens, and therefore 72 fives. 
If a number ends in 5, it consists of a number of tens and 
five units. ‘ 
Thus, 365 consists of 36 tens and 5units. The tens are divis- 
ible by 5 and also the 5 units are divisible by 5. Hence the whole 
number is ‘divisible by 5. 
Proof of III. — If a number ends in 0, it consists of a num- 
ber of tens. Each ten is divisible by 2. Hence the number 
is divisible by 2. 
If a number ends in 2, 4, 6, or 8, it consists of a number 
of tens plus 2, 4, 6, or 8 units. 
The tens are divisible by 2, and also the-units are divis- 
ible by 2. Hence the whole number is divisible by 2. 
Proof of IV. — Consider the number 684. 
1 684 = 6 hundreds + 8 tens + 4 units 
=6(99 +1) +8041) +4 
=6x994+464+8x9+844 
=6x994+8x9+6+8+4) 
2. But 6 x 99 and 8 x 9 are each divisible by 3, since 99 and 9 
are divisible by 3. 
3. Therefore 684 is divisible by 3 if (6 + 8 + 4) is divisible by 3. 
4, 648+4+4=-18=6x 3 
5 Therefore 684 is divisible by 3.

ty factor of 221 is also a factor of 442, since 442= 2 x 221.
-P-A-G-E-55
48 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
3. Hence any factor common to 493 and 221 must also be 
mon to 498 and 442, and therefore to 493 and 51. 
4, Also, any factor common to 221 and 51 must occur i 
result when 51 is added to 2 x 221; i.e, it must occur in 493 
5. Hence 221, 493, and 51 have the same common factors, 
general, — the G'. C. D. of any two integers is the same as the G. U.U. 
of the less integer and the remainder obtained when the greater is di- 
vided by the less. 
6. Dividing 221 by 51, we have 5 
7. «. the G. C.D. of 51 and 221 is the same as af22i] 4 
the G. C.D. of 17 and 51. 
8. Dividing 51 by 17, the quotient is 3. 
Hence the G. C. D. of 51 and 17 is 17. 
9. Therefore 17 is the G. C.D. of 51 and 221. (Step 7.) 
Therefore 17 is the G.C. D. of 221 and 498. (Step 5.) “17 
This solution illustrates the 
Rule. — To find the G. C. D. of two integers : 
1. Divide the greater by the less. 
2. If there is a remainder, divide the previous divisor by it. 
3. Continue in this manner, making each remainder a divisor

Least Common Multiple of Integers 
32. A Multiple of an integer is any integer which will 
contain the given integer as an exact divisor. 
Thus, 12, 20, 32, etc., are all multiples of 4. 
33. A Common Multiple of two or more integers is a mul- 
tiple of each of them. Jt will contain each of them as an

3. In order to contain 84, the L. C. M. must contain the factors 
84; that is, the factors 2, 2,3, and 7. It must therefore con-

4, In order to contain 40, the L. C. M. must contain the factor 
5, as well as the factors 2, 2, 2. 
5. Therefore the L.C. M. must have the factors 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 
5, 7. 
, That is, the L.C.M.=2x2x2x2x3x3x 5x 7=5040. 
Rule. — To find the L. C. M. of two or more integers : 
1. Find the prime factors of each of the integers. 
2. Form the product of all the different prime factors that 
appear in Step 1, using each of them the greatest number of 
times that it occurs in any one of the given integers. 
Example 2.— Find the L. ©. M. of 24, 60, and 105. 
Solution. — 1. 24=2x2x2x3 
60=2x2x3Bx5 
105=3x5x7 
2. 2 appears as a factor three times in 24, and less frequently 
in the other integers. 
3 appears as a factor only once in any of the integers. 
5 appears as a factor once in 60. 
7 appears as a factor once in 105. 
8. ..the L.C.M.=2x2x2x3x5x7= 840. 
Notr.—If the L. C.M. can be seen by inspection, then cer- 
tainly get it that way, —do not take this longer way. Thus, the 
L.C.M. of 2, 8, and 4 is evidently 12.

36. A Common Fraction consists of two integers, a Numera- 
tor and a Denominator. It is usually expressed by writing 
the numerator over the denominator, separated by a hori- 
zontal line. The numerator and the denominator together 
are called the terms of the fraction. 
In elementary arithmetic, the denominator is regarded as 
indicating a number of parts into which a whole is divided 
and the numerator as indicating the number of the parts 
being considered. 
Thus, $ is interpreted as three “one fourths” of a unit. 
Mathematicians regard a fraction as indicating the di- 
vision of the numerator by the denominator. 
Thus, 2 is interpreted by them as 3 divided by 4, or one fourth of 
three equal units. 
Both meanings are useful in applications of fractions. 
The two meanings are equivalent, in the case of integers. 
In the following figure, rectangle AB represents a unit 
and AC repfesents 3 units. Study of the figure discloses 
that AD is three “one fourths” of the unit, AB, and is also 
one fourth of the three units, AC.

2. Divide both terms of the resulting fraction by any of thei 
common factors. 
3. Continue in this manner until there results a fraction 
whose terms do not have a common factor. 
Note 1.— This process is equivalent to dividing both terms by 
their G. C. D., so a fraction can be reduced to lowest terms at one

Rule.— To multiply one fraction by another : 
1. Multiply the numerators of the fractions for the numerator 
of the product, the denominators for the denominator of the 
product. 
2. Reduce the resulting fraction to its lowest terms. 
Thus, x $=H,and2x}= 4h 
Since a fraction is reduced to lowest terms by dividing 
both numerator and denominator by any common factors of 
them, it is preferable to remove such common factors, as in

III. DECIMAL FRACTIONS 
59. Powers of Ten. — The numbers 100, 1000, etc., can 
obtained by multiplying together a certain number of 
ens. 
Thus, 100 = 10 x 10, and 1000 = 10 x 10 x 10. 
Such numbers are called Powers of Ten. Notice that the 
number of zeros in the number is the same as the number 
of tens that must be multiplied together to give that 
number. . 
Thus, 10,000 is the. product of four tens. 
60. Decimal Fractions are fractions having as denomina- 
tors powers of ten, when written as follows: 
fy is written 3; ,§, is written .08; ete. 
The period placed before the number is called the Decimal 
Point. The figures to the right of the decimal point are 
said to be in the first decimal place, the second, the third, and 
so on, 
61. A figure written in the 
first decimal place denotes tenths; 
second decimal place denotes hundredths ; 
third decimal place denotes thousandths; __ 
fourth decimal place denotes ten thousandths ; 
fifth decimal place denotes hundred thousandths ; 
sixth decimal place denotes millionths ; ete. 
Thus, .087 means 75 + 3$5 + ro's0 
But rho + reso = robo + roles = thto 
and «. 087 = 333. we Beas

Similarly, .245 means yy + ro + ra's0- 
But Y5 + ré0 + ioe = ils + rite + Woo = tte 
and ws 245 = fio. 
Rule. — To read a fraction written in decimal form: 
1. Read the number on the right of the decimal point a **‘ 
were an integer, disregarding any zeros immediately to th: 
of the decimal point. 
2. Then repeat the name of the fractional part indicated by the 
right-most digit. ° 
3. If there are digits to the left of the decimal point, read the 
number indicated by them, then the word “and,” and finally the 
decimal fraction. 
Thus, .261 is read two hundred sixty-one thousandths ; 
.0261 is read two hundred sixty-one ten thousandths ; 
-000261 is read two hundred sixty-one millionths ; ete. 
Also, 2.305 is read two and three hundred five thousandths.

Example 1.—.8+2=8,+2=~4=4 
Example 2.— .045 + 3 = 7455 +3 = zhhy = 015. 
Example 8. —12.18 + 6 = 1258 + 6 = 293 = 2.03. 
Notice that the number of decimal places in the quotient 
in each example is the same as the number in the dividend. 
Hence, 
Rule. — To divide a decimal by an integer : 
1. Carry out the division, disregarding the decimal point. 
2. Point off from the right in the quotient as many decimal 
places as there are in the dividend. 
The following example illustrates the. most convenient 
arrangement of the solution. 
Example 4.— Divide 4742.66 by 754. 
6.29 Solution. — Notice that each figure of the quo- 
tient is directly above the last figure of the partial 754|4742.66 
  
product obtained by multiplying the divisor by that 524 
figure of the quotient. Notice also that the decimal 218 6 
point of the quotient is directly above that of the 1508 
dividend. 67 86 67 86 Example 5.— Divide 287.5 by 68, carrying out the divi- 
sion to three decimal places.

68. Dividing a Number by a Decimal Divisor. 
Notice the following divisions. 
4 4 4 
2/8; also 20/80; also 200/800.       
Observe that the dividend and the divisor in the 
division have each been multiplied by 10, and in th 
division have each been multiplied by 100. All uw. 
quotients, however, are the same. Hence, 
Rule I.— The dividend and the divisor may each b: 
plied by 10, 100, etc., without changing the value of |. .... 
tient. 
This fact aids in solving 
Example 1.— Divide 6.804 by 2.1. 
Solution. —- The divisor can be made an integer bj | 
it by 10. Hence multiply both dividend and divisor _ 
  
  Then the solution of | . { the solution of 
2.1 /6.504 is the same as { 3.24 
_ , . 21(68.04 
The second dividend and divisor are 63 
obtained by moving the decimal points 50 
of the original ones one place to the 42 - 
right, et 
Rule II.— To divide a number by a decimal divisor: 
I. Move the decimal point of the divisor to the right until 
the divisor becomes an integer; then move the decim ~ ~*~ | 
the dividend an equal number of places to the righ: 
zeros as may be necessary. (See Rule above.) 
2. Then carry out the division as directed by. the Rule in

Example 2.— Divide 2.75918 by .7261. 
Solution. -~Notice that the original decimal 
points have been crossed-out, and new ones in- 
serted four places to the right. 
Example 3. — Divide .06084 by 2.54. 
Solution. -—In this example, there must be three 
decimal places in the quotient, of which 2 and 6 
oceupy the second and third places. A zero must 
be prefixed to 26 before locating the decimal point, 
in order to have as many places in the quotient as 
in the dividend.

the back of the book. Units of Measure, by whic! 
sponding quantities are measured, are given in thes: 
The Measure of a concrete quantity is a number « 
of measure of the same kind. 
Thus, a line may be eight feet in length, — the meast. 
eight and the unit one foot. Again, a lot may contain 23! 
feet, — the measure being 2345 and the unit one square foot.

Solution. —1. There remain in June 17 da. 
There are in July 31 da. 
‘There are in August 31 da. 
There are in September 30 da. 
There are in October _10 da. 
2. .. the total number of days = 119 da. 
Nots. — The first of the given dates is not included, but the 
st is ineluded. 
Example 2.—Express in years, months, and days the - 
me between Apr. 12, 1915 and Nov. 20, 1918. 
Solution. —1. From Apr. 12, 1915 to Apr. 12, 1918 is 3 yr. 
2. From Apr. 12 to Nov. 12, 1918 is 7 mo. 
3. From Nov. 12 to Nov. 20, 1918 is 8 da. 
4. «. the total time is 8 yr. 7 mo. 8 da. 
This method of solution is useful when the exact time in years, 
onths, and days is wanted. 
Nore. — When reckoning from the last day of a month having 
. days, the number of months from then until the last day of 
te month preceding the final date is taken as the number of 
onths, and then the number of days is counted. 
Thus, the time from Mar. 31 to Oct. 17 is found as follows: 
From Mar. 31 to Sept 80 is 6 months. 
From Sept. 80 to Oct. 17 is 17 days. 
Hence, the whole time is 6 months and 17 days. 
Example 3.— How long is it from Feb. 18, 1915 to

82. Reducing Denominate Numbers in the’ Metric System. — 
| In the tables of measures of length, weight, and capac- 
ity, any unit is ten times the next smaller unit of the table. 
Hence to change any number of these units to the next 
smaller units, merely move the decimal point one place to 
the right; to change to the next larger unit, move the 
decimal point one place to the left. 
Thus, 25 m. = 250 dm. = 2500 em. = 25000 mm.; 
and 25 m. = 2.5 Dm. = .25 Hm. = .025 Km. 
Expressions like 2 m. 5dm. 3 mm. are therefore unneces- 
sary in the metric system, for 
2m. 5dm. 3 mm. = 2000 mm. 500 mm. 3 mm. 
= 2503 mm. 
In changing units of surface or square measure, the 
decimal point must be moved two places to the right or . 
left for every change to a smaller or a larger unit respect- 
ively, for in the table of surface measure, each unit is one 
hundred times the next smaller unit. 
Similarly, in changing cubic units, the decimal point must 
be moved three places.

86, If a number is used as a factor two or more times 
the result is called a Power of the number. 
Thus, 3 x 3 or 9 is the second power of 3; 
and 5 x 5 x 5 or 125 is the third power of 5. 
5x5x5 is written 5% The small number written at 
the right and a little above the 5 is called an Exponent; 
the number 5 is called the Base. 
An integral Exponent indicates the number of times that 
the base is used as a factor. 
Thus, 2° means 2 x 2 x2 x 2 x 2 or 82. 
87. Involution is the process of raising a’ number toa 
required integral power. 
The second power of a number is called the Square of the 
number. 
Thus, 7 squared or 7? is 49. 
The third power of a number is called the Cube of the 
number. 
Thus, 4 cubed or 48 is 4 x 4 x 4 or 64

Thus, since 25 = 5%, then 5 is the square root of 25." 
If one number is the cube of a second, then the second is 
called the Cube Root of the first. 
Thus, sinee 8 = 23, then 2 is the cube root of 8. 
89. Evolution is the process of finding a required root of 
a number, 
90. The Radical Sign, V , when written over a number, 
indicates some root of the number. The particular root 
wanted is indicated by writing an Index to the left of and a 
little above the radical sign. 
V8 means the cube root of 8, or 2. 
V8l means.the fourth root of 81. This is 3. 
When no index is written, then the square root is 
indicated, 
Thus, V25 means the square root of 25, or 5.

based upon the following method of squaring a’ number. 
To find 742, 
Notice that 74 = 7044, To multiply 70 +4 by 70+ 4, on¢ 
may first multiply by 70 and then by 4 as below. 
70x (7044) = 7074+ 70x 4 
4x (70+4) = MWx44+ 
Hence (70 + 4)? = 70? + 2 x 70-x 4+ 4%

That is, to square a number of two figures, first square the 
tens, add twice the product of the tens and the units and 
finally add the square of the units. 
Thus, 23? = 20? + 2 x 20 x 3 4.32 = 400 + 120 + 9 = 529. 
93. Notice next that 12 = 1, 10* = 100, 100? = 10,000; ete. 
From these results it is clear that 
a. The square of a number of one figure has either one or 
two figures in tt ; 
b. The square of a number of two figures has either three or 
Sour figures in it; 
c. - The square of a number of three figures has either five or 
six figures in it. / 
Therefore, working backward, if a power be divided into 
groups of two figures each, beginning with the units’ figure, 
for each such group there will be one figure in the square 
root. The groups are called Periods. 
Thus, 6889 becomes 68 89. The square root must have in it two 
figures. It cannot have three figures by ©). above, and it must 
have more than one by (a) above. 
Similarly 45,632 becomes 4 56 32. Its square root must have in 
it three figures, a hundreds’, a tens’, and a units’ figure. 
If there are figures to the right of the decimal point, di- 
vide them also into periods of two figures each, starting from 
the decimal point. 
Thus, 4857.265 becomes 43 57.26 50. The last period on the 
decimal side is completed by annexing a zero to the given number. 
The square root of this number must have two figures to the left 
of the decimal point and two to the right of it. 
94. The Process of Computing the Square Root. 
Example 1.— Find the square root of 6889. 
Solution. —1. 6889 divided into periods becomes 68 89. There 
are in the square root a tens’ and a units’ figure. 
2. The tens’ figure must be 8, for 80? = 6400 and 90? = 8100,

From 6889, subtract -80? or 6400. 64 00 
Then 2 x 80 x 2 + 2? must be 4 89 
To find z, form the trial divisor 2 x 80 or 160. . This is con-

To the trial divisor 160 add 3, making 163. This is the com-

squaring 83.

Nors.. 1. — It sometimes happens that, on multiplying a com- 
| plete divisor, the product is greater than the remainder. In such 
cases, the figure of the root last obtained is too great, and the 
next smaller integer must be substituted for it. 
Norse 2.—If the remainder, in Step 4, is less than the trial

and 1,000,000 is between 10 and 100; etc. Hence, 
given number is divided into periods of three figure: 
beginning with the units’ figure, for each period 
number, there will be one figure in the cube root. I! 
are figures to the right of the decimal point, divide -__.: 
also into periods of three figures each, starting from th: 
decimal point. 
Thus, 3457.82653 becomes 3 457.826 530. 
The following example illustrates the method. o 
- Example 1,— Find the cube root of 74,088. 
Solution. —1. 74,088 has two periods. Hence. 
there are in the root a tens’ and a units’ figure. — 
2. 64,000 is the largest perfect cube in 74,088, 
V64,000 = 40. Place 40 in the root. . 
3. Subtract 64,000 from 74,088. 
4. Trial divisor. 3 x 40?= 3 x 1600 = 4800. . 
10,088 + 4800 = 2+. Place 2 in the root. 
5. Complete divisor. Add to 4800: 
(a) 8 x 40 x 2 or 240; and (6) 2? or 4, mak- 
ing 5044, 
6. Multiply 5044 by 2 and subtract from 10,088. Since th 
remainder is zero, the cube root is 40 + 2 or 42. 
Nors.—In practice the zeros crossed out are omitted from th 
computation. 
Rule. — To find the cube root of a number: 
1. Separate the number into periods of three figures each. 
2. Find the greatest number which is a perfect cube that i 
less than or equal to the first period; write its cube root 
the first figure of the cube root of the given number; sul

tract the cube of it from the first period, and to the remainder 
annex the next period. 
3. Form the trial divisor by taking three times the equare of 
the part of the root already found and annexing two zeros. 
4. Divijle the remainder in Step 2 by the trial divisor and 
annex the integral part to the root already found. . 
5. Form the complete divisor by adding to the trial divisor 
three times the product of the new root figure by the part of, 
the root already found, with one zero annexed, and also the 
square of the new root figure. 
. 6. Multiply the complete divisor by the new root figure and 
subtract the product from the remainder formed in Step 2. 
7. Continue in this manner until the cube root or the desired 
number of decimal places for the root has been obtained. 
Note 1.—Note 1, p. 139, applies with equal force to the above 
tule. : 
Nore 2.—If any root figure’ is zero, annex two zeros to the 
‘trial divisor and annex the next period to the remainder.

One and only one straight line can be drawn through two 
points. 
A straight line is supposed to extend indefinitely i in each 
of two directions. 
The part of a straight line between two 4 B 
points of it is called a Segment; as seg- °°

The shortest distance between two points is measured 
along the segment between them. Segments are measured 
by units of length, as the yard, the foot, the mile, ete.

statement is still to be found in elementary texts although it 
does not agree with the best modern mathematical practice. . 
Since a polygon is a closed line in a plane, it incloses a 
part of the plane called the interior of the polygon. 
This interior of the polygon is measured by units of sur- 
face measure. The Area of the polygon is the number of 
times that the interior of the polygon contains the unit of 
surface measure. 
Thus, if a polygon is such that its interior contains 8 sq. ft., 
then the area is 8 and the unit of measure is a square foot.

a. A Triangle is a polygon having three sides; as tri- 
angle ABC. A 
Any side of a triangle may be con-

opposite sides of a parallelogram are 
equal. 
Any side of a parallelogram may be 4 FD

and comes in single rolls of 8 yd. o Sable rolls oi | 
The single rolls therefore contain 4 8q- yd. of : 
Paper comes also in other widths, but in each cas 
are approximately 4 sq. yd. in a single roll of d 
paper. When estimating the quantity of paper node 
allowance must be made for the waste in cutting to ~-* 
the pattern. It is customary to cut full length 
where there are not openings, — in the expectation t 
small spaces over doors and windows can be covered witl 
the pieces of the rolls remaining after the long strips ar 
cut. 
A rough estimate of the quantity needed is obtained by 
assuming that a single roll will cover 33 sq. ft. of surface 
The total surface of the room, less the openings, divided by 
33 will give the number of rolls, 
Another way is to subtract the total width of all door: 
and windows from the perimeter of the room, and divid 
the result by the width of the paper. This will give the 
number of strips needed for the walls. The number tha‘ 
can be cut from a roll depends upon the height of th 
ceiling. .

5. Subtracting the width of all openings leaves 31’. 
6. The number of strips needed = 31'+ 18” = 202 or 21 strips. 
7. Since only 5 strips can be cut from a double roll, it will 
take 4 double rolls and one single roll, — all together 9 rolls, 
8. The cost will be 9 x $.60 or $5.40 for the sides. 
9. On the ceiling, if the strips are run the narrow way of the 
room, the number of strips needed = 17’+ 18” = 11} or 12 strips. 
10. Each strip must be 12’ long. 4 such can be cut from a

Carpeting comes usually 27 in. wide. If there is a dis 
tinct pattern in the carpet, then there is a certain amount 
of waste in cutting to match the pattern. 
Example. —If.a room is 15 ft. 4 in. long and 11 ft. 9 in 
wide, how much will the carpet cost. to cover it, if the 
carpeting is 27 in. wide and costs $.63 per yard? Assume 
that there is a waste of 11 in. on each strip except the first 
in matching the pattern. 
Solution. — 1. The natural way to run the strips is lengthwise 
of the room. ‘There will be needed as many strips as 27 in. is cor 
tained times in 11 ft. 9 in. or in 141 in. 
«. 6 strips are needed, as 141 + 27 = 5+, 
2. The first strip must be 15 ft. 4 in. long. 
Each of the others must be 11 inches longer, namely 16 ft. 3 in 
There are 5 such strips. 
3. .. there is required 15 ft. 4 in. + 5 x (16 ft. 3 in.) or all 
together 96 ft. 7 in.

120. Measuring Lumber.-— Lumber is ) measured in terms 
ofa unit called a Board Foot. 
A board foot (B. FB) is a piece of wood 1 in. thick and 
1 ft. square, 
Thus, @ board 1 in. thick, 1 ft. wide, and 10 ft. long, contains 
BF. 
Clearly, if the board were 2 in. thick it would contain 2 x 10 
or 20 B. FL 
If the board were 1 in. thick, 6 in. wide, and 10 ft. long, it is 
equivalent to a board 1 in. thick, 12 in. wide, and 5 ft. long, and 
hence has 5 B. F. 
Rule.— To find the number of board feet in a piece of lumber : 
1. Find its area in square feet. 
2. Multiply by its thickness in inches; except that, by agree- 
ment, all boards less than 1 in. in thickness are measured as if 
Lin. thick.   Example 1,—- Find the number of board feet in a 2 in. 
plank, 18 ft. long and 14 in. wide. 
Solution. —1. The area of the plank = 18 x 44 sq, ft. 
2... the number of board feet = 18 x }4 x 2 = 42. 
Nore. — Observe that the length in feet multiplied by the width 
* inches, divided by 12, and multiplied by the thickness gives the

number of board feet. Expressing these computations as in 
Step 2, permits of cancellation. 
Lumber is sold at a certain price per 1000 board feet 
(per M). 
Example 2.—Find the cost of 24 planks 20 ft 
14 in. wide, and 2 in. thick at $42 per M. 
Solution. —1. The number of B. F. = 24 x 20 x44 x 2.

The Cylinder 
121. The cylinder most commonly used should be called 
the Right Circular Cylinder to be accurate. Its flat surfaces 
are circular and are equal; they are called the Bases, The 
perpendicular between the bases is the Altitude of the 
eylinder. The area of the curved surface is the Lateral 
Area of the cylinder. 
122. Measuring the Right Circular Cylinder.— If a sheet 
of paper be cut of such size that it can be wrapped around 
the lateral surface of a 
right circular cylinder, 7 E 
AC LD so that its edges TR 
and US will exactly 
meet at line MN, then 
B e 
N the area of that sheet 
and of the lateral sur- 
face will be the same. Evidently the sheet of paper when 
flattened out will be rectangular, having its altitude 7'R 
equal to the altitude MN of the cylinder, and its base RS 
equal to the circle bounding the base of the cylinder. u

the altitude of the cylinder multiplied by the circumference of 
the base. 
In Solid Geometry, is proved :

OO SUPPLEMENTARY TOPICS 
A. Problems of the Carpentering Contractor 
124, The contractor determines from the drawings of an 
object the kind and quantity of lumber to order. He must 
always make allowances for the difference between nominal 
size of boards and actual size ; thus, a 1x 10" board dressed 
on one edge and one surface will actually measure 18" x 93". 
Also he must make allowance for waste in cutting. Most 
lumber is sold only in even lengths, so that he must order 
material that will cut up well. 
Assume that a contractor is asked to furnish for a factory 
20 sets of shelves as described in the figures below: ue
-P-A-G-E-187
  180 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
For the ends he will need 40 pieces 1” x 12” finished cypress 5’ 
long. He will probably order 20 pieces 1” x 12” cypress 10’ long. 
For the shelves and 
tops he will need 100 Front End 
pieces 1” x 12” cypress i 
about 581” long. He 
will probably order 50 
pieces 1” x 12” x 10° 
long. 
For the shelf rests 
he will need 160 pieces 
1” x 38” x 1’ long. He 
will probably order 16 Vou 3 = geale 4="" 
pieces 1” x 8” x 10’. 
For the diagonal braces, he will need 20 pieces about 64’ long. 
(Lhe length determined by measurement on the drawing.) This 
makes 130 ft. He will probably order 10 pieces 1” x 3” x 14’ long. 
For the back, since each piece of 4” ceiling wood shows only 
3)” face, he will require as many pieces 4’ long as 3}” is contained 
times in 60”; that is, 18+ or 19 pieces. For the 20 sets, he will 
therefore need 20 x 19 or 380 pieces, 4’ long. This makes 1520

Such a graph not only represents the taxes by means of 
which the graph was constructed, but can be used to deter- 
mine the taxes for other incomes between those used. 
Thus, the tax on an income of $4250 under the 1917 law is 
determined by finding on the horizontal axis the point correspond- 
ing to that income. (See the graph.) Find then the point above 
$4250 on the “tax line.” Determine the point on the vertical 
axis which is opposite this point on the tax Hine. It corresponds 
‘in this case to $50. This means that $50 is approximately the 
tax on an income of $4250, In the same manner, the tax on an 
income of $ 4250 under the proposed law is represented by a point. 
This point is opposite a point on the vertical axis which would be 
marked about $135. This means that the proposed tax would be 
about $135. Actually, this is the amount of the proposed tax.

D. United States Government Land Survey 
145. The land area of the Central and Western States 
was surveyed by the United States Government. 
Surveyors first marked the true meridian of the earth 
(running north and south) through some prominent point 
in a district. This is called N 
the Principal Meridian. 
The surveyors also marked 
the parallel of latitude running 
(east and west) through this   
    
  "yal

|_| 
  os | 24   
  point. This parallel is called & a Base Line. They also marked woh 2 24 BASE LINE © 
the parallels of latitude at in- als 
tervals of twenty-four miles Fate 
north and south of the base rea? 
line. 
On each of these parallels, points were established at inter- 
vals of twenty-four miles east and west of the principal 
meridian. Through these points, meridians were marked 
between the parallels, as shown in the figure adjoining. 
Because of the curvature of the earth, these meridians are 
a little less than twenty-four miles apart at the top, although 
” xy are full twenty-four miles apart at the bottom. 
As a result, the land was divided into tracts which are 
proximately twenty-four miles square. (See also Fig. 2.) 
Each of these tracts was divided by true parallels of lati- 
le and true meridians into parts approximately six miles

meant to be 6 mi. square. The east and west boundarie:

The townships in a line north and

VII. PERCENTAGE 
146. The expression Per Cent is an abbreviation for per 
centum, meaning “in” or “by a hundred.” 
Thus, 3 per cent means 3 in every hundred. 
The symbol for per cent is % ; thus, 3 per cent is written 
3%. 
Since 3% means 3 in every hundred, then 3% of 200 
must be 6,3% of 500 must be 15, ete. Evidently 3% of 
a number is the same as >, or .03 of the number. 
147. The Rate Per Cent is the number of hundredths to 
be found, 
The Base is the number of which a certain per cent is to 
be found. 
The Percentage is the result obtained by taking a certain 
per cent of a base. 
148. A Rate Per Cent is usually Expressed in Decims. 
when it is used. . 
Thus, 27 % = yyy = .27. 
BB 58% = 22 = .053, % = 799 = 098

151. Finding what Per Cent one Number is of Another is the 
most common method of comparing two numbers. 
Example 1.— 610 is what per cent of 2745? 
Solution. —1, 610 is the percentage, 2745 is the base, and the 
rate is unknown. 
2. Since the rate times the base equals the percentage, then 
the percentage divided by the base must give the rate. 
3. w. the rate = 610 + 2745 = 4% = 222%, 
Rule. — To find the rate when the percentage and the base 
are given, divide the percentage by the base. 
, Norn, — Usually it is wise to form a fraction whose numerator 
is the percentage and whose denominator is the base. If the 
fraction is easily reduced, it should be reduced, because the result 
may be one of the fractions given in Example 1, p. 210. If the 
fraction is not easily reduced, divide, carrying the result out, if 
necessary, to one or two decimal places, as in § 149.

152. Finding the Base when the Percentage and the Rate are 
Given, while less common a problem than those considered 
in § 150 and § 151, is necessary at times. 
Example 1.— 85 is 5 % of what number? 
Solution. —1. 85 is the percentage, 5 % is the rate per cent, and 
the base is unknown. 
2. Since the rate x the base = the percentage, 
then the base = the percentage + by the rate. 
3. wo. the base = 55 — 1700. 05 
Check. — Does .05 x 1700 = 85? Yes. 
Rule.—To find the base when the percentage and the rate 
are given, divide the percentage by the rate. 
Norn. — If the rate is easily expressed as a common fraction, 
the solution may be performed as in Example 3, below. 
Example 2. — What number increased by 8 % of itself is 
540? 
Solution. —1. The number is 100 % of itself. When increased 
by 8 % of itself, the result is 108 % of the number. 
2. .. 540 = 108 % of some number. 540 is the percentage and 
108 % is the rate per cent. 
3. +. the base = 540 + 1.08 = 500. 
Check. — Does 1 08 x 500 = 540? Yes. 
Example 3. —126 i is 871 % of what number? 
Solution. —1. 874 % =F 
2. .. 126 = § of some number.

VIII BUYING AND SELLING GOODS 
153. The advertised price at which an article may be 
bought is called the List Price.. Sometimes the article is 
sold for less than the list price; then the difference between 
the list price and the actual selling price is ealled a Dis- 
count. 
A discount is usually stated as a certain per cent of the 
list price. 
Thus, a discount of 2% from the list price means that 2% of 
the list price is subtracted from the list price. 
154. Why Discounts are Given. —— Wholesalers usually pub- 
lish a general catalogue describing their goods. In this 
catalogue, a list price for each article is given. This price 
is usually made. great enough so that it is the maximum 
price that must be charged even if the price of material and 
labor should increase. In order to inform their customers 
about the actual prices at any time, wholesalers issue from 
time to time a list of discounts from these published list 
prices, In rare cases, especially recently, wholesalers have 
had to add to their list prices in order to arrive at adequate 
selling prices. 
The following is an excerpt from such a price list, giving 
prices relating to page 184 of a certain jobber’s catalogue.

Sometimes special discounts are given to favored cus- 
tomers, either because they are large purchasers or as a 
special courtesy to them because of personal friendship. 
such cases, the first discount is computed on and subtracted 
from the list price; the second discount is computed on and 
subtracted from the first remainder ; ete. 
Ezample.— Find the net cost of an automobile tire listed 
at $32.60, with discounts of 20% and 10%. >

The first remainder = $26.08 -» , 4 fan 
3. 10% or of $28.08= 261 * YI, 
The net price = $23.47. LY 
156. When goods are bought, an agreement is made a 
about the time when payment is due. This comes u: 
the Terms of Sale. The sale may be for “net cash,” o1 
“net cash in 10 days,” or 30 days, or 90 days. When, , 
ment is not demanded at once, a discount for cash payment 
is usually offered. 
Thus, the terms of a sale may be “29% for cash in 10 days, or 
net cash in 30 days.” The cash discount is subtracted from the 
net cost after all other discounts have been subtracted. 
157. Below is a sample Invoice, modeled after one used 
by a well-known manufacturing company. Note in it the 
manner of indicating the terms of payment, as well as the 
general form of the invoice. 
In this invoice, “2%/15th Prox.” means that 2% will be 
-“owed if payment is made on or before the 15th of the next 
ath. 
At the end of the invoice, the 2 % cash discount had been de- 
ted by the clerk at Wharton and Huber’s at the time of mak- 
payment, for, as indicated by the Receipt, the Payment was 
je before the 15th of the next month.

Profits and Losses 
158. Profits and Losses in sales of merchandise or in other 
business transactions are usually computed and described in 
per cents, 
The Net Cost of an article is the actual sum paid for it. 
If other expenses are incurred in getting possession of the 
article, such as freight or delivery charges, fees to a pur- 
chasing agent, or if expenses are incurred in disposing of 
the article, such as expense for rent, heat, light, clerk hire, 
etc.,—all these items must be added to the net cost to give 
the Gross Cost. 
If an article is sold for more than its cost, then 
The Selling Price — The Gross Cost = The Profit. 
If an article is sold for less than it cost, then 
The Gross Cost — The Selling Price = The Loss. 
Profits and losses are usually computed as a certain per 
cent of the cost. The cost is the base, and the profit or loss 
is the percentage.

Marking Goods 
159. Merchants often employ a secret system for mark- 
ing the cost and selling price of their goods. Often the 
letters of some word are used to represent the digits with 
which numbers are written. 
Thus, the letters of the word manuscript, 
adjoining, might be used to represent the 
digits below them respectively. manuscript 
12384567890 
Then, to represent $269, the letters acp would be written on 
the price tag. 
To avoid the repetition of one letter where a price like 
44¢ is to be represented, a repeater such as the letter z is 
used. 
Thus, 44 ¢ would be represented by uz. 
A typical price tag representing a cost of mnsr 
$13.57 and a selling price of $16.75 is shown | —jrors |

160. One problem of the merchant is the determination 
of a selling price so as to gain a reasonable profit on the

Commission and Brokerage 
161. Firms and individuals often buy or sell goods or 
conduct other business transactions through agents. Such 
agents are also called Salesmen, Commission Merchants, or 
Brokers. : 
A Commission Merchant buys and sells farm, garden, and 
dairy produce, and groceries. 
| A Broker arranges business bargains and contracts be- 
tween parties. There are real estate brokers, stock brokers, 
bond brokers, cotton brokers, ete. 
The person or persons for whom an agent acts is called 
his Principal. 
The fee charged by an agent in general is called a Com- 
( mission. That charged by a broker is called Brokerage. In 
j many cases the fee is a certain per cent of the money value 
of the property involved in the transaction. 
162. Goods shipped by a commission merchant to his 
principal or by a principal to his agent is called a Shipment ; 
goods received by either from the other is called a Consign- 
ment, 
A commission merchant, after selling goods for a principal, 
sends him an Account Sales; after buying goods for a prin- 
cipal, he sends him an Account Purchases. 
The Gross Proceeds of a sale is the sum received from the 
purchaser. The Net Proceeds is the sum remaining for the - 
principal after all charges have been deducted. 
In case a commission merchant purchases goods for a 
principal, the Prime Cost is the actual sum paid for the 
goods. The Gross Cost is the sum of the prime cost and all 
other expenses involved in making the purchase and ac- 
quiring possession of the goods, such as freight, cartage, ete. 
  163. The commission fee, when expressed as a per cent, és 
based upon the gross proceeds of a sale or on the prime cost of a 
purchase.

164. Interest is money paid for the temporary use of 
some other person’s money. It is like rent paid for the 
temporary use of a house, farm, boat, or any other piece of 
property belonging to another person. 
The Principal is the money borrowed, on which interest is 
paid. The Amount is the sum of the principal and interest. 
Interest is usually deseribed and computed as a certain 
tate per cent of the principal for one year. This rate per 
{ cent.is the Rate of Interest. It will be understood that the 
j tate is for one year. The year is usually regarded as con- 
sisting of 12 months of 30 days each or 360 days. IX. INTEREST

cipal alone.

= $59.50, 
2 .. the interest for 2 yr. = 2 x $59.50

Solution. —1. The interest for L yr. = .05 x $775 = $38.75. 
2. .. the interest for 1 mo. = zy of $38.75 = 33.229, 
38. .. the interest for 7 mo. = 7 x $3.229 = $22.603, or $22.60. 
4, Since 11 days = 43 mo., the interest for 11 days = 4} x $3.228 
= Beene = $1.183+ or $1.18, 
5. .. the total interest is $22.60 + $1.18 = $23.78.

Rule. — To find the interest on a given principal for | 
time at a given rate, multiply the principal by the ra_., 
that product by the time expressed in years. 
Nore 1.—In practice, one uses the method which best suits 
the problem. 
a. Tf the time is a number of years, multiply the interest fo 
one year by the number of years. 
b. If the time involves months, find the interest for on |! 
by dividing the annual interest by 12, and then multipl, ., —' 
number of inonths. 
However, for such a time as 8 mo., take 44 or } of the annua 
interest, 
Add the interest for the number of months to the interest fo! 
the given number of years. 
c. If the time involves days, consider 80 days as forming : 
month. Divide the monthly interest by 30, or the annual interes 
by 860, and multiply by the number of days. Add the result t 
the interest for the given number of years and months. 
However, if the time is such as 12 days, note that 12 
or # of a month, hence the interest for 12 days is 3 the | 
interest. Similarly, 12 days = g% of a year, cnd hem... | 
terest for 12 days is #4 or yy of the annual interest. 
Nore 2.— Carry out computations only to mills, and then in 
crease the number of cents by 1 if the number of mills is & ‘ 
than 5. Thus, $29.637 will be called $29.64. Otherwise (

167. Six per cent is a commonly used rate of interest. 
This rate, combined with the assumed thirty-day month, 
leads to the use of the Six Per Cent Method of computing 
interest. 
«, The interest on any principal for a year at6% is .06 of 
the principal. Hence, the interest for two months is .01 of 
the principal and for one month is } of .01 of the principal. 
Rule.—To find the interest at 6% for any number of 
months: 
(1) Find .01 of the principal by pointing off two places. 
(2) Then divide by 2 and multiply by the number of months. 
Norr.— When the number of months is even, multiply the 
result of Step 1 by 4 the number of months. 
Thus, the interest on $175.25 at 6 % for 10 months is 
5 x $1.7525 = $8.7625 = $8.76, 
And the interest on $175.25 at 6 % for 7 months is 
7x 4 of $1.7525 = 7 x $.87625 = $6.13375 = $6.18.

months and days may be computed as in the following 
example. 
Example.— A man bought $175 worth of coal on July 
17, 1918, agreeing to pay 6 % interest on this sum until the 
bill was paid. He paid it on Nov. 10,1918, How much 
interest did he have to pay? 
Solution. —1. From July 17 to Oct. 17 is three months; from 
Oct, 17 to Oct. 31 is 14 days; from Oct. 81 to Nov. 10 is 10 days. 
Hence the total time is 3 months 24 days. 
2. The interest on $175 at 6% for 8 mo. = $2.63. (§ 167) 
3. The interest on $175 at 6% for 24 days = $ .70. 
4. .. the total interest . = $3.38. 
If the time is more than one year, find first the number 
of years, and then the number of months and days as in the 
following example. 
Example. — Find the interest at 6 % on $1150 from June 
18, 1917, to April 11, 1919. 
Solution. —1. From June 18, 1917, to June 18, 1918, is 1 year. 
From June 18, 1918, to March 18, 1919, is 9 months. 
From March 18, 1919, to April 11, 1919, is 24 days.

171. Since the calendar year consists of 365 days, there 
is a slight inaccuracy in basing interest computations upon 
an assumed year of 360 days. 
Thus, the interest for 40 days should be’ 34%; of the annual 
interest instead of 34, The interest therefore should be a little 
less than that charged by the computations based upon a 360-day 
year. 
Interest calculated by considering the exact number of 
days in the given time and using 365 days for the year is 
called Exact Interest. It is used by the United States Gov- 
ernment in computing interest on its securities. It is also 
used by some business houses.

Example. — How long must $1000 be on interest at 6 % 
to double itself? 
Solution. —1, Since the money doubles itself, it earns $1000 in 
interest. 
2. The interest on the given principal, $1000, for 1 yr. at 6% 
is $60.00. 
8. Therefore it will take as many years as $60 is contained times 
in $1000.

ifficiently accurate results are obtained. Thus, if the time should 
appen to be 2.736 yr., the years are 2. 
-736 yr. = .736 x 12 mo. = 8.832 mo. 
-832 mo. = .882 x 30 da. = 24.96 da. or 25 da.

176. A Savings Bank receives small sums of money for 
deposit, paying interest therefor. Interest is computed, as 
a rule, quarterly or semi-annually on certain specified 
Interest Days. The time between two successive interest 
days is called the Interest Period. Interest is allowed 
usually only on the smallest cash balance of the depositor 
during the interest period ending on the day interest is 
computed. Interest is not allowed on any fractional part 
of a dollar. 
Thus, if the smallest balance during a period is #278. 67, 
interest is computed on $273. Savings Bank Accounts

Interest is usually at the rate of 3% or 4%. 
If the interest is not drawn when payable, it is added to 
the principal, and draws interest as a new deposit; in this 
way savings banks pay compound interest. 
The following form of record is kept in a savings bank. 
It is assumed that interest at 4% is computed on the 1st of 
January, April, July, and October.

at a certain rate compounded semi-annually for a certain sumo 
of years is the same as the compound interest on and the 
amount of $1.00 at one half that rate compounded annually for 
double the number of years.

unpaid, some contracts provide that interest shall be paid 
upon unpaid interest as well as on the principal until all is 
paid. This form of interest is called Periodic Interest. This 
form of interest is illegal in some states.

X. INSURANCE 
182. Property is often destroyed by fire, wind, and acci 
dents ; individuals lose wages as a result of sickness, acci- 
dents, and other causes ; families lose their source of support 
through the death of some member. AI] persons are exposed 
to these risks, some more and others less, but only a small 
number actually suffer losses of any one kind in a limited 
period of time. 
Insurance is the business devised for distributing these 
losses so that each member of a group bears a share deter- 
mined by the protection he receives. The business of fur- 
nishing insurance is conducted by insurance companies who 
operate through agents to be found in all towns. 
Thus, 100 farmers each owning a $3000 barn might agree that 
they would rebuild the barn of any one of their number if it 
should be destroyed by fire. If one ‘barn is destroyed, $3000 is 
lost. Each farmer would then contribute $30, including the man 
whose barn was lost. Each is willing to make this expenditure 
to protect himself against the possible loss of $3000. 
An Insurance Policy is the contract between the company 
and the insured. It states the amount of protection, called 
the Face of the Policy, and the conditions under which the 
insurance is afforded. Every one taking out an insurance 
policy should read it with great care, and should insist 
upon having the meaning of all its conditions fully ex- 
plained. 
An Insurance Premium is the sum which the insured pays 
the company in return for the insurance. 
272
-P-A-G-E-280
| INSURANCE 273 
Fire Insurance 
i83. The Standard Fire Insurance Policy provides insur- 
ance “to an amount not exceeding” a specified sum for any 
direct loss or damage by fire. This loss is the “actual cash 
value” of the property damaged at the time of the fire. 
Norsr.—In case some insurance is paid an insured because of 
damage to his property by fire, the face of the policy is then auto- 
matically decreased by the amount of insurance already paid by 
the company. 
By agreement with the companies, an insured may divide 
_ his total insurance among two or more companies. Then, 
in case of loss, each company pays as much of the loss as 
insurance is of the total insurance. 
Thus, if the total insurance is $5000, one company insuring 
00, and another $2000, then the first company would pay § 
| the second % of any loss by fire. 
.84. The. fire insurance premium depends upon many 
tors, —such as, the kind of fire protection provided by 
: city or town, the kind of building occupied by the 
ured, the business conducted by the insured, the number 
occupants in the building, etc. As a rule, fire insurance 
npanies are members of one of two associations of such 
npanies. These associations employ men whose business 
is to decide upon rates which will be adequate and just. 
ese rates are recommended to the companies. Specific 
es are recommended for each risk in a business district 
a city, and a schedule of rates for all other kinds of 
urable property. 
The rate is usually expressed as a number of cents per 
.00 of insurance for one year. 
185. Upon some kinds of property, a policy can be taken 
6 for a term of three years or of five years. When a
-P-A-G-E-281
274 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
policy és taken out for a term of three years, the premium 
is two and one-half times, and for five years the premium is 
Sour times the annual premium. (Western Union rates.) 
Norg.— Formerly the three-year premium was twice, and the 
five-year premium was three times the annual premium.

186. The agent of the company receives a Commission 
for his services. 
The commission is a per cent of the premium charged by 
the company. 
One group of companies pays its agents: 
25% on dwelling houses and contents and most public build- 
ings; 20 % on mercantile buildings; 15 % on other buildings.

TS - —— INSURANCE 277 
187. Short Term Rates. —- Policies are sometimes written 
for less than a year. In such cases the following table of 
short term rates is used. 
These rates are used also when a policy is canceled. If 
the insured asks to have the policy canceled, and he always 
has the right to do so, the company is allowed to charge 
the short term rate for that part of the term of insurance 
which has already expired, and must return to the insured 
the balance of the original premium. [If the insurance com- 
pony cancels the policy, and it has the right to do so on 
five days’ notice, then it is allowed to charge for that part 
of the term of insurance which has already expired as much 
of the original premium as the expired term is of the orig. 
inal term, 
Thus, if a one-year policy has run for seven months, the com- 
pany can retain only seven-twelfths of the original premium, 
This is called pro-rating the premium for the short term.

188. Co-insurance.—Some policies provide that the in 
sured should insure his property for a specified per cent o! 
the value of the property. The owner, however, may no 
take out the specified amount of insurance. In such cases 
‘the policy provides that only as much of any loss suffere 
will be paid as the actual insurance is of the specified in 
surance, not exceeding, however, the face of the policy.   Thus, suppose that a piece of property should be insured for 
$8000 and that the owner carries only $6000 worth. Then the 
owner will receive only 3 of any loss he suffers by fire. If th 
fire damage is $4000, he will receive $3000. 
This provision is contained in a co-insurance clause of the 
policy, which states the per cent of insurance that the in 
sured should carry. The idea is that the insured becomes : 
co-insurer with the company if he does not take out th 
specified amount of insurance. Co-insurance is never ap 
plied to dwellings or household goods. Usually a lowe 
rate is charged when the policy contains a co-insuranc 
clause.

Life Insurance 
190. Life Insurance premiums are based u 
rate computations in which percentage ir 
another plays an important part. These 
however, are all made in the actuarial depa 
companies. The computations which either ue agene or 
the insured have to make are quite elementary. The pre- 
miums depend upon the kind of policy the insured desires 
and upon the age of the insured. Below are given the 
rates of a certain company for certain ages for eacl 
three kinds of policies. Similar rates for applicants ol 
ages between 20 and 60 inclusive are obtainable from we 
agents of a company. The rates of different companies 
vary a little but not much from these.

Under the ordinary life policy, the insured pays premiums as 
long as the policy is in force; the face of the policy is payable to 
the beneficiary at the death of the insured. 
Under the twenty-payment life policy, the insured pays pre- 
miums for twenty years at most. At the end of twenty years, the 
policy is fully paid. The face of the policy is payable to the 
beneficiary of the insured at the death of the latter, whether that 
occurs before or after twenty years. 
Under the twenty-year endowment policy, the insured pays 
premiums for twenty years at most. The face of the policy is 
payable to the insured at the end of twenty years, if he is living, 
or to the beneficiary of the insured if the latter should die before 
twenty years. 
If the premium of a life. insurance policy is paid semi-

191. Dividends. — Most life insurance policies now issued 
are participating policies. Annually the insured receives 
from the company what is incorrectly called a dividend. 
Actually, it is a refund from the company of the insured’s 
share of savings made by the company on estimated ex- 
penses, or of savings from estimated losses, or of certain 
interest earnings of the company in excess of those antici- 
pated. These dividends may be used by the insured to 
decrease the amount of the premium due the company, may 
be allowed to accumulate at compound interest in th: 
of the company, or may be disposed of in other way:: 
the consent of the insured and of the company.

XI. TAXES 
192. Village, city, town, county, and state taxes include 
some or all of the following: 
a. Real Estate Tax, levied upon the assessed value of 
| the real estate (including improvements) of an individual. 
b. Personal Property Tax, levied upon the removable 
personal property, such as household goods, automobile, 
animals, money, securities, ete. ‘ 
ce. Special Taxes for special purposes, such as the con- 
struction of sidewalks, sewers, streets, etc. 
d. Income Tax, levied upon the assessable income of an 
individual. 
e. Inheritance Tax, levied upon wealth inherited from a 
deceased resident of the taxing community. 
f Poll Tax, a fixed amount levied upon each (male) 
resident of a community. 
Of these taxes, the first three are quite general; the next 
two are increasingly becoming sources of revenue for gov- 
| ernmental agencies. 
a Property Taxes 
193.. The assessed value of property is the valuation 
placed upon it for taxing purposes by the properly con- 
stituted officers, called Assessors. 
The value is sometimes definitely assumed to be only 
one third or one half the actual value; in other cases, it is 
assumed to be the actual value of the property. 
Any individual, dissatisfied with the assessed valuation 
of his property, may appeal to the Board of Review, at an 
| agreed-upon time, for a revaluation. 
287  
-P-A-G-E-295
288 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
194. The tax itself is computed as a certain rate per 
cent of the assessed value; this rate is called the Tax Rate. 
The following example shows how one community deter- 
mined its tax rate in a recent year. ,

The tax rate was determined by regarding the total 
taxes, $ 989,845.36, as the percentage and the total assess- 
able property, $70,703,240, as the base. 
What per cent of $ 70,703,240 is $989,845.36? The re- 
sult is the tax rate. 
By § 151, the tax rate is 1.4%. 
Example 2.— What was the real estate tax and the 
personal property tax of a man whose real estate was 
valued at $3575 and personal property at $1450? 
Solution. —1. The realty tax = 1.4 % of $3575 
= $50.05 
2, The personal property tax = 14 % of $1450 
= $20.30. 
Where the assessed valuation of the property is very 
- great, as in the case of railroads and public utility corpora

town is $825,000 and of personal property $394,625. 
There are 465 citizens who pay a poll tax of $1.50 each. 
The town wishes to raise $16,475 in taxes. What must be 
the rate of taxation ? 
195. Special Assessments are levied at times upon the 
owners of property which will be benefited by some special 
improvement. They are levied particularly in villages and 
cities to obtain income with which to pay for the construc- 
tion of sidewalks, streets, sewers, ete. The computation 
 
-P-A-G-E-299

of the assessments for street construction is usually base 
upon a specified amount per front fcot. These and the 
other special assessments rarely present any arithmetical 
difficulties. 
Supplementary Topics 
196. Several states in the United States now derive rev: 
enue from Income Taxes. While the laws of the several 
states vary in minor particulars, all agree in specifying +hat 
a certain part of the income of a resident of the state shall 
be exempt from taxation, and secondly that income d: , 
from certain sources shall be exempt, — such as incom: 
corporations that pay taxes to the state. The bala... -- 
the income of a resident is called his taxable incom. 
In one state, $800 of annual income of every 
is exempt, and $1200 of income of every mati.cw wun 
whose wife is living; besides, an additional $200 for every 
child under 18 years of age, and for every dependent of the 
resident, is exempt. The rates of taxation for taxable in- 
come follow: 
Taxable income between $1 and $1000 is taxed 1 % ; 
between $1000 and $2000, 11%; between $ 2000 and 
$3000, 14 % ; between $3000 and $4000, 13 % ; between 
$ 4000 and.$ 5000, 2% ; between $ 5000 and $ 6000, 21 % ; 
and each additional $1000 is taxed an additional 1% until 
$ 13,000 is reached. All income above $ 13,000 is taxed 6%. 
Norx.— Observe carefully that a certain rate applies to the 
first $1000; then a new rate to the second $1000; a new one to 
the third $1000; etc., until $ 13,000 is reached. 
Example. — What is the annual income tax of a man in 
this state whose taxable income is $ 2500? 
Solution. an 
1. The tax on the first $ 1000 is 1 % of $1000 or 
2. The tax on the second $1000 is 13 % of $1000, or

State Inheritance Tax 
198. Some states derive income from inheritance taxes. 
The laws regulating these taxes also vary but have some 
common elements. The rate of taxation depends upon the 
amount of the inheritance, and secondly, upon the relation- 
ship of the beneficiary to the deceased. The following 
table gives the rates in one state, for near relatives.

National Taxes 
199. The money for the support of the national govern- 
ment is derived chiefly from Duties levied upon the most 
recent Tariff Law and taxes levied upon the most recent 
Revenue Act of Congress. : 
Duties 
200. Duties or Customs are taxes levied upon goods im- 
ported into the United States. 
A Specific Duty is a fixed tax upon an article without 
regard to its value. If the weight or quantity of the goods 
is expressed in metric units, these must be changed to equal 
English units. 
Thus, the duty on maple sugar is 3 per pound. - 
An Ad Valorem Duty is levied at a certain rate per cent 
of the cost of the goods in the country from which they 
are imported. If this cost is expressed in units of foreign 
money, the cost must be expressed in units of our money. 
Thus, the rate on silk clothing is 50 % ad valorem. 
Tf a silk dress costs 500 fr. in France, the equivalent price in our 
money is 500 x $.193 or $96.50. The duty on it would be 50 % 
of $96.50 or $48.25. 
Ad valorem duties are not computed on fractions of a 
dollar. 
201. When the duty is specific, certain allowances are 
made. 
Tare is an allowance made for the weight of.the container 
in which the goods is imported. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
296 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
Leakage is an allowance for the loss of any liquids im- 
ported in casks or barrels. : 
Breakage is an allowance for the loss of any liquid im- 
- ported in bottles. 
202. The Tariff Law provides rates of taxation on all 
articles likely to be imported. 
Norr.— A copy of the latest tariff law can be obtained through 
the representative in Congress from your district. 
There is a list of articles on which duties are levied, — 
called the Dutiable List; there is also a list of articles on 
which duties are not levied, — called the Free List. 
Thus, pure bred animals for breeding purposes, leather boots 
and shoes, coffee, enter free of duty. 
203. Administration of the Tariff Law. — Goods purchased 
abroad must enter the United States through certain ports 
called Ports of Entry. At each such port, is located a 
United States Customs House. Proper officers at the eus- 
toms house receive a description of important merchandise, 
examine some or all of a shipment, decide upon the duties 
that must be paid, and, after receiving the duties, issue the 
necessary permits to have the merchandise landed. 
Nore. — Importers may store goods in government warehouses, 
after giving bond for the payment of the duties. Later, upon 
payment of storage charges, duties, etc., the importer may with- 
draw his goods from the warehouse. 
Individuals entering the United States from abroad must 
declare whether they have in their baggage any dutiable 
goods. Their baggage and persons are subject to inspection.

Internal Revenue 
204. Revenue taxes for the Government derived from 
sources within the country are levied at present (1919) 
under a Revenue Act of Congress which was enacted in 
February, 1919. This act levies taxes upon the manufac 
ture, sale, and consumption of various products; upon 
various forms of amusement and business; upon incomes 
of individuals and corporations ; and upon inheritances. 
Norr.— A copy of this Act of Congress can be obtained from 
the Collector of Internal Revenue of your district, or through the 
Congressman from your district. 
205. United States Income Taxes.— One schedule of 
tates is provided for the taxation of the incomes of. 
individuals, and another for the incomes of corporations. 
‘The kind of income that is taxable is described in the 
revenue act. , 
An Income Tax Return must be filed by every unmarried 
person whose net income for the year is more than $1000, 
and by every “head of a family” whose net income is more 
than $2000. For the former, $1000 is exempt from taxa- 
tion, and for the latter $2000 is exempt, and also for the 
Jatter $200 additional for each child under 18 years of age 
and for each dependent who is actually supported by the 
head of the family. 
The law provides for a Normal Tax and a Surtaz on the 
net annual incomes of an individual. 
Normal Tax Rates. — On the first $4000 of net taxable 
income the rate is 4%; on the balance of the net income 
the rate is 8 %. 
Thus, a single man, having a net income of $8500 is allowed an 
exemption of $1000, so that his taxable income 
first $4000 of this, the tax is 4% or $160; on th 
the tax is 8% or $280. Hence his total normal -. — .....

Surtax Rates. —If the net taxable income of an individual 
exceeds $ 5000, an additional tax is levied, at different rates 
for different parts of the income.

The following examples show how to compute the surtax 
and the total tax. 
Example 1.—-'The normal tax for a single man having a 
net income of $ 8500 was found to be $440. His surtax is 
computed as follows: 
On the $1000 between $5000 and $6000, he pays 1% or $10 
On the $2000 between, $6000 and $8000, he pays 2% or 40 
On the $500 between $8000 and $8500, he pays 8% or 15 
His total surtax is 
His total income tax is $440 + $65 or $505.

4. The surtax is computed on that part of the income in excess 
of $5000. 
On the first $1000 (i.e. up to $6000) the tax is 1% or $10 
On the next $2000 (i.e. up to $8000) the tax is2% or 40 
5. Hence the total surtax is $50 
6. Hence the total income tax is $804 + $50 or $354. 
Example 3,.— What is the income tax of a man and wife 
having an income of $25,000? 
Solution.—1. Their exemption is $2000, so that their taxable 
income subject to the normal tax is $23,000. 
2. Normal Tax. On the first $4000, the tax is 4% or $ 160 
On the remaining $19,000, the tax is 8% or 1520 
Hence the total normal tax is $1680 
8. Surtax. The surtax is computed on all the income in excess 
of $5000. 
On $1000 between $5000 and $6000, the taxis1% or $10 
On $2000 between $6000 and $8000, the tax is 2% or 40 
On $2000 between $8000 and $10,000, the tax is3% or 60 
On $2000 between $10,000 and $12,000, the tax is4% or 80 
On $2000 betwetn $12,000 and $14,000, the tax is 5% or 100 
On $2000 between $14,000 and $16,000, the tax is 6 % or 120 
On. $2000 between $16,000 and $18,000, the tax is 7 % or 140 
On $2000 between $18,000 and $20,000, the tax is 8 % or 160 
On $2000 between, $20,000 and $22,000, the tax is 9% or 180 
On $2000 between $22,000 and $24,000, the tax is 10% or 200 
On $1000 between $ 24,000 and $25,000, the tax is 11% or 110 
Hence the total surtax is $1200 
4. Hence the total income tax is $1680 + $1200 or $2880.

XII. BANKING 
207. Uses of Banks. Banks afford places of safe deposit 
for money. Money deposited in a checking account ordi- 
narily does not draw interest. Such deposits give the 
depositors a corresponding amount of Credit. 
Banks lend money or credit. 
Banks furnish convenient means of transferring money 
or eredit from one person or firm to another. 
Promissory Notes 
208. A Promissory Note is a written promise of one per- 
son (or firm) to pay a specified sum of money to another 
‘fed person (or firm). , 
e Maker of the note is the person who signs it, — the 
womising to pay. 
e Payee of a note is the person to whom payment is 
ised. One of the following forms is used. 
Pay to John Davis. 
:alone may demand payment. 
Pay to John Davis or order. 
:or any one whom he designates may demand payment. 
Pay to bearer. 
ly one legally possessing the note may demand payment. 
1e Face of a note is the sum to be paid. 
1e place of payment is usually specified. If it is not, 
the note is payable at the office of or else at the home’ 
te maker.

whenever payment is requested during business hours of 4 
working day. 
b. A Time Note is payable at a future time that can be 
determined, — such as “ thirty days after date.” 
Norz.—If payable a certain number of months after date, 
then calendar months are meant. 
If payable one month after the last day of any month, it is 
payable on the last day of the next month. 
If payable a certain number of days after date, the actual num- 
ber of days, including Sundays and holidays, is meant. 
If a note becomes payable on Sunday, or on a holiday, or ona 
Saturday when Saturday is a half-holiday, the note is is payable on 
the next business day. 
Three additional days, called Days of Grace, in which 
payment might be made were formerly quite commonly 
allowed. In a few states they are still allowed. 
210. Interest-bearing Notes. — If interest is to be paid on 
the note, then the words “ with interest” or “ with interes 
at a number of % ” are added after the place of payme

can be sold by the payee to another person. Such a note is 
Negotiable. Otherwise a note is Non-negotiable. The payee 
of a negotiable note may surrender his rights by Indorsing it

The form a is called a “blank indorsement”; form 6a 
“full indorsement”; form ¢ a “qualified indorsement.” 
When using form a or b the indorser assumes responsibility 
for the payment of the note if the maker fails to pay. 
When using form c, the indorser does not guarantee the 
payment of the note. 
212. Joint and Several Notes. A note reading “We 
Promise to pay” and signed by two or more persons is a 
Joint Note. A note reading “I promise to pay” and signed 
by two or more persons is a Several Note. 
In either case, the payee may collect the whole payment 
‘if necessary from any one of the makers. When the note 
is a joint note, then each of the makers can hold the others 
for their share of the face of the note. 
213. To obtain payment of a note, the holder must pre- 
sent it to the maker on the date of maturity. If the maker 
refuses to make the payment, the holder may turn the note 
over to a notarv public, who also presents it to the maker 
payment is again refused, the notary 
sest, and sends notice of the facts to all 
i the note. Then, each indorser in turn 
e for the payment of the note.

Partial Payments 
215. Sometimes the holder of a note permits the maker 
of it to pay part of the face of the note before the date of 
naturity. Such payments are called Partial Payments. 
In many cases, the holder of a note will not accept any 
partial payments except on interest payment dates, and 
then only if the partial payment is a specified sum such as 
a multiple of $50. ‘Thus, if a note is dated on June 5, 
1918, with interest payable semi-annually, partial payments 
might be accepted only on Dee. 5, and June 5, and in multi- 
ples of $ 100. 
Whenever partial payments are accepted, they are recorded 
on the back of the note as below:

216. One of two rules is employed to determine th 
amount still due on the note at maturity, when partial pay- 
ments have been made. 
The Merchant’s Rule is usually employed when final se- 
tlement is made within a year from the date of the note. 
Rule.—x1. To the face of the note, add the interest upon it 
from the date of the note to the date of the settlement. 
2. To each partial payment, add the interest upon it from the 
date when it was made to the date of settlement. 
3. From the result of Step 1, subtract the sum of the results 
in Step 2. The remainder is the balance due. 
This rule will be applied to determine the amount due on 
Dee. 8, 1918, on the note with indorsements shown in § 215.

In columns 1, 2, and 4 are recorded the date of the note and of 
the payments, the date of final settlement, and the face of the note 
and of the payments. In column 8, is entered the difference in 
time between the corresponding dates in columns 1 and 2; thus, 
the first payment draws interest for 8 mo. and 20da. The inter

est is then computed and entered in column 5, and the amount in 
column 6. Then the sum of the amounts of the three payments

217. The United States Rule. If the final settlement is 
made more than one year after the date of the note, the 
amount due is found by the following rule, adopted by the 
Supreme Court of the United States. 
Rule.—1. Find the amount of the face of the note to the 
time when the payment or the sum of the payments made 
equals or exceeds the accrued interest. 
2. From this amount, subtract the payment or the sui 
the payments. 
3. Consider the remainder the new face of the note and pro 
ceed as before up to the date of the settlement. 
Notice that the interest to date must be paid before any 
partial payment or payments can be used to decrease the|

face of the note. The justification for this rule is that the 
lender has a right to expect his interest on the debt before 
consenting to apply a payment to a reduction of the debt.

Discounting Notes 
218. Banks, when lending money, may deduct the inter- 
est in advance. 
- Thus, a man borrowing $1000 from a bank for 60 days, with 
interest at 6 %, may be asked to pay in advance $10, the interest 
on $1000 at 6 % for 60 days. / 
The bank, in this case, is said to Discount the Note. 
A person or firm, having accepted from an individual his 
note, and wanting the money at once, may ask a bank to 
purchase the note. Again, the bank is said to Discount the 
Note. 
Example. —The Acme Manufacturing Co. holds a non- 
interest-bearing note for $1000, payable in 60 days. They 
ask a bank to discount it. What are the proceeds? — 
Solution. —The bank may offer $990 for the note. In doing 
80, the bank deducts $10 from the face of the note, this being 
the interest on $1000 at 6 % for 60 days. The proceeds are $990. 
219. Bank Discount is a charge made by a bank for the 
payment of a negotiable note before the note is due. 
The day on which the note is discounted may not be the 
day on which the note was written. The time from the day 
of discount to the date of maturity is the Term of Discount. 
The Discount is a certain per cent of the amount of the 
note at maturity. The rate per cent used is called the 
Rate of Discount. This may not be the same as the rate of 
interest payable on the face of the note. 
The Proceeds of a discounted note is the amount at matu- 
ty less the discount. 
Example 1.—Find the proceeds of a 90-day note for 
500 discounted on the date of making at 6%. 
Solution. 1. Since the note is non-interest-bearing, its amount 
+ maturity is $500.
-P-A-G-E-321
314 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
2, Being discounted on the date of making, the term of discount 
is 3mo. 
3. The discount = the interest on $500 at 6 % for 3 mo. = $7.50. 
4, ~. the proceeds = $500 — $7.50 = $492.50. 
Example 2.— Henry Sanders asked his bank to discount 
for him on Oct. 25, 1918, a note for $1200, payable in 90 
days, without interest, dated Oct. 15, 1918. What were 
the proceeds ? 
Solution.—-1. The note did not bear interest, hence the amount 
at maturity was $ 1200. 
2. Being a note for 90 days, it matures 90 days after Oct. 15. 
Hence on Oct. 25 it still has 80 days to run,—-the term of dis 
count. 
3. The bank offers to discount it at 6 %. The discount, there 
fore, is the interest at 6 % for 80 days on $1200, or $16. 
4, The proceeds are $1200 — $16, or $1184. 
Example 3.— Find the proceeds of a note for $750 dated 
May 12, 1918, payable 90 days after date, bearing interest 
at 5 %, if discounted June 23, 1918, at 6 %. 
Solution. —1. The interest on $750 at 5 % for 90 days is $9.38. 
Hence the amount of the note at maturity = $ 750 + $9.88=§$ 759.38. 
2, The note matured 90 days after May 12, or on Aug. 1* 
3. The term of discount was from June 23 to Aug. 10, or 4: 
4. The discount was the interest on $759.38 for 48 days : 
or $ 6.08. 
5. The proceeds were $759.38 — $6.08, or $753.30.

Checks 
221. A Check is a written order upon a bank made by 
sue of its depositors, to pay a specified sum of money toa 
specified individual or his order. 
The bank is the Drawee; the person signing the check 
is the Drawer; the one to whom it is payable is the Payee; 
the sum to be paid is the Face of the Check.

222. If Henry Sears as well as William Marks : 
positor of the Commercial National Bank, and Hen: 
presents the check for deposit at this bank, the clerL. u.., 
merely transfer credit of $25.31 from the accour* -* “ 
Marks to the account of Mr. Sears. This is th 
form of the problem of exchange. 
Mr. Sears, or some one to whom he indorses the chee 
may deposit or cash the check in a diferent bank. 
Banks, are in this way daily cashing or accepting for d 
posit checks drawn upon other banks. In a smal’ 
nity, each bank is likely to send a messenger dail: 
of the other banks of the community whose che 
been accepted, to ask for money to the value of thes 
Thus, credits in one bank are transferred to another vaus. 
This also is a simple problem of exchange. 
In a larger community, the settling up between banks 
is accomplished through a Clearing House. Clerks repre 
senting each of the members of the clearing house associa 
tion gather at a specified time, exchange with one another 
the checks of their respective banks, recording the amount: 
thereof, and report to the manager of the association the 
totals of these exchanges. By suitable procedure, the ix 
debtednesses between the member banks are all paid within 
a few hours. This is the most complex problem of exchange 
in a given community. 
223. Banks in small communities usually have funds on 
deposit in at least one bank of a near-by larger com 
In particular, banks of the country are grouped in 
districts in each of which is a Federal Reserve Banu, wi 
which most of the banks of that district are associated. 
224. Payments made by Checks to persons in other towns.

in college at Cambridge, Massachusetts. His son

receiving credit for it. The Federal Reserve Bank at Bos- 
ton will send it to the Federal Reserve Bank at Dallas, 
Texas, receiving credit for it. If the bank on which the 
check is drawn is a member of the Dallas Federal Reserve 
Bank, the latter, deducting the amount of the check from 
the account of the issuing bank, sends the canceled check 
to that bank. The issuing bank, in turn, deducts the amount 
of the check from the balance of the drawer. Thus, credit 
has been transferred from the father in Texas to the son in 
Massachusetts. Sometimes a small fee, ; % of the face 
of the check, is charged as exchange by the bank cashing 
the check. The other banks handle the check as a matter 
of business courtesy between themselves. 
This process represents a complicated form of Domestic 
Exchange. 
Other Ways of Transferring Credit 
225. Since a check is signed only by an individual, per- 
sons unacquainted with him, or the payee, often do not wish 
to accept the check. Hence, for transfers of funds to a 
considerable distance certain other means are often employed. 
     
       
  226. A Certified Check is a personal check of a depositor 
in a bank, across the face of which am officer of the bank 
has written over his signature the word “Good” or 
“Certified.”

Such certification dispels any doubt about the value of 
the check, for it is a criminal offense for a bank to certify 
a check unless the face of it is actually on deposit in the 
bank. 
227. A Cashier’s Check is a check drawn by the cashier 
of a bank, making a sum of money payable to an individual. 
There is not any charge, usually, for issuing such a check 
to a regular depositor of a bank.

  To obtain such a check, Mr. Winters must pay the 
bank the equivalent of it. The check is readily accepted 
in exchange, for it has behind it the reputation of the bank. 
228. There are other methods of. transferring money 
from one community to another, which should be men- 
tioned because of their connection with the preceding 
sections. 
Post Office Money Orders may be used to transfer credit 
either to a point in this county or abroad. They are espe- 
cially useful for sending small sums of money. 
The members of the class should each obtain or be given 
an Application for Domestic Money Order. They may be 
obtained at any post office. Upon the back of this Appli 
cation will be found the rates for money orders.
-P-A-G-E-328
BANKING 321 
Money may be Transferred by Telegraph. The only ad- 
vantage in so. transferring credit is the speed with which 
it can be done. The rates and provisions are obtainable at 
any telegraph office. : 
‘Travelers’ Checks are used very commonly by persons 
who are traveling. Express companies and banks charge 
$% vf the face of the check as commission.

Such certificates of deposit serve as receipts for funds 
left. on deposit with a bank. Banks pay interest on such 
funds. 
In one community, 21% interest is allowed on funds 
remaining on deposit three months, 3% on money on de- 
posit six months, and 4% on money on deposit one year. 
By properly indorsing the certificate, the owner of it 
may transfer his credit to some one else. 
The certificate may be made payable to some one else at 
the start.

Drafts and Acceptances 
230. A more popular means of sending money to a dis- 
tance is a special form of check called a Draft. 
A Draft is a written order from one individual, firm, or 
bank to another, directing the latter to pay a specified sum 
of money to a third party,
-P-A-G-E-330
BANKING 323 
The Drawer is the person signing the draft; the Drawee 
is the person, firm, or bank to whom the draft is directed ; 
the Payee is the one to whom payment is to. be made. 
Ezample.— Assume that Mr. Sampson of Philadelphia, 
Pa., owes Mr. Bristol of Peoria, Ill., $600. He may go 
toa bank in Philadelphia and purchase a draft, payable to 
Mr. Bristol. Since the Philadelphia bank does not have a 
correspondent in Peoria, it will probably give him a draft 
on a Chicago bank. 
To obtain this draft, Mr. Sampson must pay the Phila- 
delphia bank $600. Also, a charge of 3, % of the face of 
the draft is often made. This charge is very commonly 
omitted when the purchaser of the draft (Mr. Sampson) is 
a regular depositor in the bank. 
Mr. Sampson will send the draft to Mr. Bristol. The 
latter, to obtain the money, will proceed exactly as if he 
had received a check (§ 221). The bank cashing the draft 
may make a charge for the cost of collecting the face of the 
draft. 
Nors.—1. Mr. Sampson may have the draft made payable to 
him, In this case, he will indorse it over to Mr. Bristol, using 
the full indorsément (§ 210) and then send it to Mr. Bristol. 
Norz.—2. The words “value received” and “charge.to the 
account of ” are not necessary. 
When both the drawee and: drawer are banks, the draft 
is called a Bank Draft. A bank draft is particularly desir- 
able as a means of sending money to a distance, because it 
| ss behind it the business reputation of a bank. 
Usually, a bank draft is a sight or demand draft. Pay- 
ment is specified by such phrases as “pay on demand” or 
“pay at sight.” It is payable as soon as presented and will 
be cashed or accepted for collection by any bank.

in commercial transactions. Such drafts are call. wun 
mercial Drafts. They may be either sight drafts or time 
drafts. 
Commercial Sight Draft. Suppose that the No 
ing Company of Minneapolis, Minn., sells to Henr 
Maumee, Ohio, a carload of bran. They receive fui vue sau 
road company a Bill of Lading. Mr. Marston must present 
this bill of lading to the railroad delivering the car before 
he can get possession of the car. If the Milling Company 
wants to insure payment for the bran, they make out the 
following sight draft upon Mr. Marston.

    and is Dollars 
Value received and charge the same to the account of 
The Northern Milling Co. 
T____enry Manaton William Martell, 
Maumee, Chto. Secretary. 
  
The Milling Company deposits this draft, attached to 
the bill of lading, at its bank in Minneapolis. The bank 
sends it to a bank in Maumee, Ohio. That bank notifies 
Mr, Marston that it has the bill of lading and draft. Mr. 
Marston, after paying the face of the draft, receives the bill 
of lading, and can then get his carléad of bran. 
The Maumee bank may charge a small fee for its services. 
This charge may be a small fee (25) or a small per cent 
! (ts %) of the face of the draft. It sends the net proceeds 
to the Minneapolis bank, and the latter credits the account 
of the Milling Company. The Minneapolis bank may, but 
probably does not, make any charge for its services to the 
Milling Company, because the latter are regular customers 
of the bank, The minimum charge is usually 25 ¢. 
232. A Commercial Time Draft is payable after the expira- 
tion of a specified length of time. Payment is specified by 
such phrases as “15 days after date,” or “15 days after 
sight.” 
In such cases, the draft is presented to the drawee to 
determine whether he intends to pay the money. If the
-P-A-G-E-333
326 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC . 
drawee decides to pay the draft, he signifies 1 
by writing across the face of the draft the word 
with the date and his name. 
After the draft is accepted, it is called an Accept: ~-- 
An acceptance is a form of promissory note. Thr 
having accepted it, thereby promises to make pa; 
a certain time. 
The date of maturity is reckoned as the specified 
days from the date of the draft, tf i is payable a 
days after date, or as the specified number of days fi 
of acceptance if it is payable a number of days after sight. 
Example.— Assume that Henry Green of Windsor, IHL, 
has owed Arthur Brown of Boston, Mass., $250 for some

233. In case the payments from one community to an- 
other are much greater than the collections for it from the 
other, then it becomes necessary. to send actual money from 
the first community to the second to pay the indebtedness. 
Persons in the first community asking for drafts to make 
payments in the second community will then be asked to 
pay a fee for exchange, amounting possibly to 1% of the 
face of the draft. In this case, Exchange on the second 
community is at a Premium or above Par. 
On the other hand, if the credits of one community are 
greater than its debits, then the person offering to purchase 
a draft payable in the second community may be offered 
a discount. Exchange is then at a Discount or Below Par.

The Rate of Exchange is the rate per cent of the face of a 
draft charged for drawing the draft when business con- 
ditions make it necessary to control the flow of money from 
or into a community. This charge is in addition to the fee 
for issuing the draft.

form of promissory note, it will be discounted on the same 
conditions as a promissory note. -Jt will be assumed that 
the drafts are payable a number of days after sight, unless 
something is said to the contrary. 
Example. — The Hartford Manufacturing Co. had a ninety- 
day draft for $1250 drawn upon James Markley, dated 
May 12, and accepted by Markley on May 15. Needing

l of Exchange. Formerly, when ocean transportation

ued in triplicate. These were sent by different routes

thereby. Now, however, they are issued at most only in| 
duplicate, one copy being placed on file as a matter of 
record in case the other is lost. When issued in duplicate, 
they take the following form:

Exchange may be transmitted also by cable. 
236. Rates of Foreign Exchange depend upon the balance 
in trade between this country and the foreign country to 
which it is desired to send money. Exchange on foreign 
countries is quoted daily in the newspapers of large cities. 
In exchange between the United States and England, 
£100 is theoretically equivalent to $486.65, and $100 is 
theoretically equivalent to 518.1 fr. in exchange between 
the United States and France. In the table following are 
given the rates of exchange on July 23, 1918. 
Cables 476.425 Cables 570 
Tondon Checks 475.275 France Chocks 5715 
This means that £100 was equal to $476.42 if ex- 
changed by cable, and to $475.275 if exchanged by draft; 
that $100 was equal to 570 francs if exchanged by cable, 
and to 571.5 if exchanged by draft.
-P-A-G-E-340
LL aL A LT, BANKING 333 
Comparison with the theoretical equivalents shows that 
exchange with England and France was below par on July 
23, 1918, indicating that the balance of trade was in favor 
of the United States, since bankers deemed it necessary to 
encourage shipment of funds abroad by giving more than 
the theoretical equivalent. 
Example.— What was the cost of cable exchange on 
London for £160 8s. on July 23, 1918? 
Solution. —1. £160 8s. = £ 160.4. °

XIII. PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATIONS 
287. A Partnership is an association of two or more per- 
sons, called Partners, formed by a written contract, to 
engage in business in common for the purpose of making 
profits. 
Nore. — Students will find an interesting article discussing the 
subject of Partnership in the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
Partnerships are organized under special laws of the 
various states. 
The total money and property contributed by the partners 
is called the Capital. 
The Assets of a company comprise all its money and 
| property at any particular time, and the Liabilities of a 
company are its debts. 
238. A General Partner may be a real partner, one who 
actually shares in the management and profits of the busi- 
ness; a silent partner, one who shares in the profits but 
not in the management of the business; an ostensible 
partner, one who appears to be but is not actually a partner. 
The general partners of a business are individually re- 
sponsible for all liabilities in excess of the assets. 
In some states, special partnerships may be formed... In 
such, there must be at least one general partner. The 
special partners contribute to the capital, and are liable for 
debts of the company only to the extent of their contribu- 
tion to the capital. 
A partnership is sometimes for a fixed term of years and 
sometimes for an indefinite period. A partner cannot 
withdraw from a firm before the close of the term of 
agreement unless the partnership is dissolved.

The death of a partner, the bankruptcy, or th. 
of a partner automatically bring about the diss: 
the firm. A partner cannot dispose of his inter 
out the consent of the other partners. 
The manner of distributing the profits is spec“ * 
contract between the partners. In the followin. 
some methods of distribution are described.

vorth. They agree to divide the profits equally. If | 
profits are $3780, what should each receive ? . 
2. A and B formed a partnership, A contributing $ 2000 
and B $4000. They gained $2460. They agreed to divide 
the profits in proportion to their respective contributions to 
the capital. 
Suggestions. —1. What was the total capital? 2. What part 
of the capital did A contribute? 3. What part of the profits 
should he receive? 
3. A, B, and C form a partnership to which each con- 
tributes equal services; A contributes $2000, B % 3200, 
and C $4800. They agree to divide the profits in propor- 
tion to each partner’s contribution to the capital. "What 
should each partner receive out of $4350 profits ? 
4. A, B, and C form a partnership. A contributes 
$ 8000, B $7500, and C $6500. They agree to divide the 
profits in proportion to their shares of the capital. How 
much should each receive out of the $6275 profits ? 
5. Suppose that, in the preceding example, the partners 
also agree to divide any losses as they divide the profits. 
If the assets of the ‘company at the time of dissolution are 
$ 22,750, and the liabilities are $ 28,430, how much should 
each contribute to pay off the indebtedness ?

6. Assume that partner A in Example 5 is bankrupt at 
the time of dissolution. How much must B and C each 
pay if they agree: a. To pay their own shares and each 
to pay one half of A’s share? 0. To pay the debts in pro- 
portion to their contributions to the capital ? 
7. Assume that partners A and Bin Example 5 are both 
bankrupt at the time of dissolution and that C has great 
wealth, How much must C pay to the creditors to close 
up the affairs of the firm ? 
8, A and B form a partnership. A contributes $15,000 
and B $5000 to the capital. They agree that A is to re- 
ceive from the business a salary of $150 per month and 
B $100 per month, and that the net profits at the end of 
the year shall be divided in proportion to their contribu- 
tions to the capital. The average monthly income is $ 450, 
from which the salaries are deducted. What should each 
teceive at, the end of the year from the accumulated net 
profits ? 
9. A and B form a partnership as follows: A contrib- 
utes $ 7300 and B, $4700. They agree that each shall 
receive at the end of the year 6 % interest on his share of 
the capital, and that they will divide equally the surplus 
profits. What should each receive out of $2350 gross 
profits ? 
10. Suppose that A and B in Example 9 agree that the 
surplus profits, after paying the interest on invested capital, 
shall be divided in proportion to the amount of capital in- 
vested. What should each receive in this case? 
11. The following plan is a very common one. 
Aand B invest $6000 and $10,000 respectively in a ~ 
business. They agree that A is to receive from the busi- 
ness annually $1500 and B, $1800; that: each is to receive 
6 % interest on his invested capital; and that the surplus 
profits are to be divided equally. What does each receive 
out of gross profits of $ 5200?

$ 1200, $ 3300, and $2700, respectively. They agree that 
each is to receive 6 % interest on his invested capital and 
that the net profits shall be divided equally. At the close 
of the year (Dec. 31), they found that they had liabilities 
as follows: bills payable, $736.45; a note for $500, dated 
Nov. 20, with interest at 6%, which they must pay on or 
before Jan. 30. 
They have the following assets: cash on hand, $ 1638.75; 
bills receivable, $1482.31; a 90-day note for $375, with 
interest at 6 %, dated Dec. 1; a 30-day acceptance for $ 250, 
dated Dec. 15 ;.a 60-day acceptance for $ 425, dated Nov. 25.

Corporations — Stocks and Bonds 
239. Men wishing to engage in a large business under- 
taking usually organize a Joint Stock Corporation. To do 
so, they must comply with the laws of the state in which 
they organize. A copy of the statutes relating to private 
corporations can be obtained by applying to the secretary 
of state in any state. 
240. The ownership of a corporation is divided into 
Shares of Stock. Stock is either Common Stock or Preferred 
  | dividends when and only when. all other obligations ofthe, 
company are paid The owner of preferred stock, is not

The preferred stock may be Cumulative sca in which 
case the owner is guaranteed income at a fixed rate per cent 
per year; if the dividend for any year or years is unpaid 
when due, the owner is guaranteed that it will be paid 
ultimately if the corporation is solvent. 
Each share of stock has a nominal value, called the Par 
Value as a rule. Recently, corporations have been issuing 
common stock having no par value. Often but not always, 
the par value is $ 100. 
The shares of stock are sold in order to obtain the Capital 
of the corporation.

Each purchaser of stock is given a Stock Certificate.

information about them. 
The owner of shares of stock may sell them to some o 
else, by indorsing his stock certificate. The new purchas 
then sends the indorsed certificate to the transfer age 
of the corporation in order to have a record of the transf 
made upon the books of the corporation.

involved in buying and selling follows : 
Mr. Jones wants to sell 100 shares of U. S. Steel Common

sell “at the market” or at some specified price. If the market 
price happens to be 116}, Mr. Jones may ask 116} f

Bonds 
244. A Bond is a certificate indicating ownership of part 
of an indebtednéss of a corporation; it is a promise to pay 
a fixed sum of money at a definite future time, with interest 
at a fixed rate, payable periodically. Often there is some 
sort of security pledged to secure payment of the bonds. 
Thus, the owners of a piece of property, wanting a large 
sum of money, borrow it from some banking institution, 
and, as security, mortgage their property to the institution 
as trustees. 
The bankers then issue bonds whose total face value is 
the amount of the sum loaned the owners of the property. 
On the other hand, governments of nations, stetes and 
municipalities issue bonds, the only security for 
ment of which is the honor of the issuing govern. 
. The rate of interest and the time when the loan 
able are specified in the bond. The interest is , 
payable semi-annually. It is a rate per cent of t: 
the bond. 
A Registered Bond provides a place in which thi 
name may be written. The borrower then mail] 
terest to the owner of the bond when it-falls due. 
A Coupon Bond has coupons for each of the int: | 
ments due upon it attached to it. As these bec 
the owner of the bond cuts them off and deposit: 
his bank for collection. 
A complete description of the various kinds o: WL... .. 
beyond the scope of this book. 
Nore. — In the section of a magazine, like World’s Work, devoted 
to! financial advertisements, investment houses often advertise their 
«0 send without charge a copy of a pamphlet describing 
Bonds. One such copy for a school is enough. 
uker in the town can -probably give to the school a 
zent number of the Bond Record, published by Halsey 
of New York City.
-P-A-G-E-353
346 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
245. Bonds are described in such manner as ta 
such items as the name of the debtor, the year of t...u..., 0 
the rate of interest, and often the character of the security. 
Thus, Western Pacific R. R. Co. 1st Mortgage 5’s, Series 
A, is a 5% Ast mortgage bond of the Western Pacific 
R. BR. Co. 
246. The great advantage of bonds, in general, over 
stocks is that they represent a definite sum of money that 
must be paid at a certain time; that they bear interest ata 
definite rate that must be paid at specified times, taking 
precedence over all dividend payments of the debtor. 
247. Cost of Bonds. The current market price of bonds 
may be above or below the face value of the bond, — above 
or below par. Whatever the market price, the owner of a 
bond is entitled to the face value of the bond at maturity. 
Bonds sell at a certain market price plus accrued interest, 
Thus, if a man buys on March 1 a bond on which the interest is 
payable on January 1 and July 1, he must pay the market price 
plus interest on the face of the bond from January 1 to March L 
On July 1 he receives the interest on the face from January 1 to 
July 1, thus getting the interest he paid the previous owner of 
the bond as well as the interest due on the bond since he pur 
chased it. 
‘When bonds are purchased through a broker, Brokerage 
amounting to 4% of the face of the bond is charged. 
Hence the purchase price equals market price plus ac 
crued interest plus brokerage. 
248. The Rate of Income from a bond is the rate per 
cent which the annual interest is of the purchase price. 
Example.— Find the purchase price of a $1000 5% 
bond at 95 on March 12, if the interest is payable Feb. and 
Aug. 1. Also find the annual rate of income.

-P-A-G-E-354
PARTNERSHIPS AND CORPORATIONS 347 
Solution. —1. The market price = 95 % of $1000 = $950. 
2. The accrued interest on $1000 from Feb. 1 to March 12 — 
that is, for 39 days— is $5.42. 
The brokerage is 1 % of $1000 or $1.25. 
Hence the purchase price = $950 + $5.42 + $1.25 = $ 956.67. 
The annual income is 5 % of $1000 or $50. 
The annual rate of income is 5.2+ %, 
~ for $50 is 5.2+ % of $956.67. Poe we 
249. The Yield of a Bond is the rate of income realized 
from the bond if the bond is held until maturity. 
Thus, suppose a man buys a $100 bond for $98; that the rate 
of interest is 5 % and that the bond matures,in 1 year. 
the year, the man receives $5 interest (5% of $100), 
the end of the year $2 more than he paid for the bond, 
bond is worth $100 at maturity. All together he receive 
an investment of $98 for Jd year. His rate of income i 
71%. 
If this same bond matures in two years, he will have rec 
total of $10 interest and $2 profit when the bond matures. 
gether he will have received $12 for the use of $98 for tw: 
or at the rate of $6 per year. This is about 6.1%. This: 
the approximate yield of income on this bond, as compoun 
est on the interest paid semi-annually has been neglected.

is, attached to each are coupons for the semi-annual interest. 
‘When the interest becomes payable, the coupon should be 
cut from the bond and taken to a bank, where the full cash 
value of it (less a small collection charge possibly) can be 
obtained for it. Coupons for the interest for two years’ 
time were attached to the bonds. At the close of that time, 
information about the manner of obtaining the semi-annual 
interest may be obtained from any banker, 
If the holder of a bond is compelled by circumstances to 
sell it, he should go to a bank where he will be able to obtain 
the current market price of the bond.,

XIV. EQUATION OF PAYMENTS 
251. Equation of Payments is the process of finding at 
what time several payments which are due at different times 
may be paid at one time without injustice to either debtor 
or creditor. 
The Date of Payment so determined is called the Equated 
Date, +- and the time is called the Equated Time. 
Example 1.— A owes B $25 due in 3 mo., $50 due in 
4 mo., $35 due in 5 mo., and $40 duein 7 mo, What is 
the equated date of payment ? 
Solution. —1. A at present is entitled to the use of the $25 for 
3 mo. This is the same as the use of $1 for 25 x 3 mo. or 75 mo. 
2. Thus, 
A is entitled to the use of $25 for 8 mo. or of $1 for 25 x 3 or 
75 mo. 
A is entitled to the use of $50 for 4 mo. or of $1 for 50 x 4 or 
200 mo, 
A is entitled to the use of $35 for 5 mo. or of $1 for 35 x 5 or 
175 mo. 
A is entitled to the use of $40 for 7 mo. or of $1 for 40 x 7 or 
280 mo. 
3. All together, A is entitled to the use of $1 for 730 mo. 
4. The total sum owed is $150. He is therefore entitled to the 
use of $150 as many months as 150 is contained times in 730. 
This is 4}4 mo. or 4 mo. 26 da. 
5. .«. A can make the payment 4 mo. 26 da. from now. 
Nore 1.—To check the solution, find the interest up to the 
equated date on all payments due before that date, and the discount 
on all payments due after it at any rate per cent. These two 
should be equal approximately.

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS 351 
Nors 2,—-If in a result a fraction of a day is 4, or more, then 
the length of time is increased by one day; otherwise, the frac- 
tional part of a day is omitted. 
Example 2.— What is the equated date of payment of 
$200 due May 4, $ 300 due June 12, and $ 400 due July 24? 
Solution. —1. Assume that all payments are made on May 4. 
2. Then the June 12 payment is made 39 days ahead of time, 
and therefore the debtor loses the use of $300 for 39 days or of $1 
for 11,700 da. 
3. The July 24 payment is made 81 days ahead of time, and 
therefore the debtor loses the use of $400 for 81 days or of $1 for 
32,400 days. 
4. All together, the debtor loses the equivalent of the use of $1 
for 44,100 days. 
5. Hence, the date of payment is as many days after May 4 as 
on is contained times in 44,100, or 49 days. 
*. the equated date = May 4 + 49 days = June 22. 
Example 3, —Find the equated time and the balance to be 
we on the following account.

Solution. —1. The Aug. 27 item is actually due on Sept. 26; 
and the Sept. 8 credit matures on Oct.8. These and the other 
due dates are in the third column below. 
2. Assume that the settlement is made on the earliest of the 
: datas in anhimn 8, 
ebit item is paid “ days before itis due. Hence 
es the use of $350 for 14 days or of $1 for 4900 
Similarly for items 2 and 3 of the debits. All 
the use of $1 for 28,275 days. (See Cols. 4 and 5.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
352 NEW HIGH SCHOOL ARITHMETIC 
4, The first credit item is paid 26 days after the settlement da’ 
Hence Mr. Johnson gains the use of $275 for 26 days or of $1 f 
7150 days. Similarly, for items 2 and 3 of the credits. All t 
gether, Mr. Johnson gains the use of $1 for 17,150 days. 
5. By paying on Sept. 12, Mr. Johnson loses the use of $1 f 
11,125 days. This is‘equal to the use of the balance of $100 f 
111.25 days. 
6. Hence the real date of settlement should be 1114 days afte 
Sept: 12. This is Jan. 1, 1918. Legally this makes the date 
settlement Jan. 2, 1918.

4, All together, Mr. Stuart. owes interest to the amount of 
$5.9292 — $5.40 or $.5292, if he settles the account on Sept. 7.

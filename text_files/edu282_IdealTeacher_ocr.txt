INTRODUCTION 
On the whole the American people are sincerely 
and deeply appreciative of their schools and teachers, 
The teachers themselves are for the most part con- 
tented in their work, strenuous and baffling as it may 
be. And whatever may be said of the shortcomings of 
teaching as a life, they stand loyally by it. In spite of 
moments of pessimism, they seldom change to an- 
other work, so tenacious are its ultimate attractions. 
But it would be quite wrong to assume that either 
the public or teachers have no just criticism to make 
upon the life and the product of schools. The educa- 
tional ideals, and consequently the expectations of 
both, are too high to permit a smug satisfaction with 
things as they are.; The layman wants better service 
from teaching) The teacher wishes a happier life in hig 
swork. They will probably continue to demand these 
till the end of time, though the schools grow con- 
stantly better. There is no ungratefulness in this at- 
titude; it is part of the idealism that attaches to the 
work of schools and keeps them forever progressive. 
It is for the body of teachers to strive earnestly to 
do their part to achieve both these ends —¢ to increase 
the social service of their.teaching-and.to~perfect

their joy in the work. This is what we mean when 
we say that we should make of teaching both a pro- 
fession and a fine art. 
Teaching will be a profession when we have learned 
the need of thorough scholarly equipment, and single- 
minded devotion to our daily and hourly duties in 
the school-room, under the guidance of those larger 
ideals which the world has set up for the protection 
of its cherished values. Nothing less. than expert 
knowledge, tempered by a spirit of reverent ministry 
_tothoseplaced under our tuition, will ever make us 
"professional teachers. 
Teaching will be a fine art when the situations of 
schoolroom life are made to call for the best in teacher 
and pupil. In such a soil of noble motivation the 
highest powers of human beings thrive. The teacher 
who drives or is driven, who forces himself or his 
children through stated tasks, without any sense 
of their significance, will not find teaching congenial. 
He will never know that absorption which is the 
essence of art. Half-heartedly he will teach, his other, 
more imperious impulses beckoning him away to 
another life. And while he stays, he will know only 
that pain of conflict which destroys the possibility 
of happy work. To achieve real success, teaching 
must be kept an interesting business, where the free 
impulses of children and teachers are so used as to 
accomplish useful things happily.

THE IDEAL TEACHER 
In America, a land of idealism, the profession of 
teaching has become one of the greatest_of human pacing uae Decome one ol ie pose 
Z In 1903-04 half a million teachers

same facts differently, we may say that a fifth of our 
entire population is constantly at school; and that 
wherever one hundred and sixty men, women, and 
children are gathered, a teacher is sure to be among 
them.

knowledge has widened, and the creative opportu- 
nities involved in conducting a young person over 
it have correspondingly become apparent, the pro- 
fession of teaching has risen to a notable height of 
dignity and attractiveness. It has moved from a sub- 
ordinate to a central place in social influence, and 
now undertakes much of the work which formerly 
fell to the church. Each year divinity schools attract 
fewer students, graduate and normal schools more. 
On school and college instruction the community 
now bestows its choicest minds, its highest hopes, 
and its largest sums. During the year 1903-04 
the United States spent for teaching not less than 
$350.000,000. 
Such weighty work is ill adapted for amateurs. 
Those who take it up for brief times and to make 
money usually. find_it unsatisfactory. Success is 
rare, the hours are fixed and long, there is repe- 
tition and monotony, and the teacher passes his 
“days among inferiors. Nor are the pecuniary gains 
considerable. There are few prizes, and neither in 
school nor in coltege will a will a _teacher’s ordi 
come carry him much above want. College teach- ing is falling more and more into the hands of 
    “men of independent means. ‘The poor can hardly 
afford to engage in it. Private schools, it is true, 
often show large incomes; but they are earned by 
the proprietors, not the teachers. ‘On the whole, 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  THE IDEAL TEACHER 5 
teaching as a trade is poor and disappointing 
business. 
‘When, however, it is entered as a profession, as 
a serious and difficult fine art, there are few employ- 
ments more satisfying. All over the country thousands 
of men and women are following it with a passion- 
ate devotion which takes little account of the income 
received. A trade aims primarily at personal gain; 
.a_profession at the exercise of powers beneficial to 
mankind. This prime aim of the one, it is true, ~ 
often properly becomes a subordinate aim of the 
other. Professional men may even be said to offer 
wares of their own — cures, conversions, court vic- 
tories, learning — much as traders do, and to receive 
in return a kind of reward. But the business of the 
lawyer, doctor, preacher, and teacher never squares 
itself by equivalent exchange. These men do not give 
so much for so much. They give in lump and they 
get in lump, without precise balance. The whole 
notion of bargain is inapplicable in a sphere where the 
gains of him who serves and him who is served coig- 
cide; and that is largely the case with the professions. 
_ Each of them furnishes its special opportunity for 
the use of powers which the possessor takes delight 
in exercising- Harvard College pays me for doing 
what I would gladly pay it for allowing me to do. 
No professional man, then, thinks of giving accord- 
ing to measure. Once engaged, he gives his best,
-P-A-G-E-12
6 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
gives his personal interest, himself. His heart is in 
his work, and for this no equivalent is possible; what 
is accepted is in the nature of a fee, gratuity, or con- 
sideration, which enables him who receives it to 
maintain a certain expected mode of life. The real 
payment is the work itself, this and the chance to 
join with other members of the profession in guid- 
ing and enlarging the sphere of its activities. 
The idea, sometimes advanced, that the profes- 
sions might be ennobled by paying them powerfully, 
is fantastic. Their great attraction is their removal 
from sordid aims. More money should certainly 
be spent on several of them. Their members should 
be better protected against want, anxiety, neglect, 
and bad conditions of labor. To do his best work one 
needs not merely to live, but to live well. Yet in that 
increase of salaries which is urgently needed, care 
should be used not to allow the attention of the pro- 
fessional man to be diverted from what is impor- 
tant, — the outgo of his work, — and become fixed 
on what is merely incidental, — his income. When 
a professor in one of our large universities, angered 
by the refusal of the president to raise his salary on 
his being called elsewhere, impatiently exclaimed, 
“Mr. President, you are banking on the devotion of 
us teachers, knowing that we do not willingly leave 
this place,” the president properly replied, “Cer- 
tainly, and no college can be managed on any other
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE IDEAL TEACHER he 
principle.” Professional men are not so silly as to 
despise money; but after all, ‘it is interest in their 
work, and not the thought of salary, which predomi- 
nantly holds them. 
Accordingly in this paper I address those only 
who are drawn to teaching by the love of it, who re- 
gard it as the most vital of the Fine Arts, who intend 
to give their lives to mastering its subtleties, and 
who are ready to meet some hardships and to put 
up with moderate fare if they may win its rich dh 
portunities. 
But supposing such a temper, what special quali- 
fications will the work require? The question asked 
thus broadly admits no precise answer ; for in reality 
there is no human excellence which is not useful for 
us teachers. No good quality can be thought of 
which we can afford to drop. Some day we shall 
discover a disturbing vacuum in the spot which it 
left. But I propose a more limited problem: what 
are those characteristics of the teacher without which 
he must fail, and what those which, once his, will 
almost certainly insure him success? Are there any 
such essentials, and how many? On this matter I 
have pondered long; for, teaching thirty-nine years 
in Harvard College, I have each year found out a 
little more fully my own incompetence. I have thus 
been forced to ask myself the double question, 
through what lacks do I fail, and in what direction 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  8 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
  lie the roots of my small successes? Of late years 
I think I have hit on these roots of success and 
have come to believe that there are four of them, 
— four characteristics which every teacher _must 
possess. Of course he may possess as many more 
as he likes, — indeed, the more the better. But 
eae fot appese fundamental I will briefly name 
’ an_aptitude for vica- 
§ ian: and second, an already accumulated 
ok wealth and thir ili invi li TOU! 
knowledge; and fourth, a_readiness to be forgotten. * 
Having these, any teacher is secure. Lacking them, » 
lacking even one, he is liable to serious failure. But 
as here stated they have a curiously cabalistic sound 
and show little relation to the needs of any profession. 
They have been stated with too much condensation, 
and have become unintelligible through being too 
exact. Let me repair the error by successively ex- 
panding them. 
The teacher’s art takes its rise in what I call an 
aptitude for vicariousness. As year by year my col- 
lege boys prepare to go forth into life, some laggard 
is sure to come to me and say, “I want a little advice. 
Most of my classmates have their minds made up 
about what they are going to do. I am still uncer- 
tain. I rather incline to be a teacher, because I am 
fond of books and suspect that in any other profession 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
    THE IDEAL TEACHER 9 
TI can give them but little time. Business men do not 
read. Lawyers only consult books. And I am by 
no means sure that ministers have read all ithe books 
they quote. On the whole it seems safest to choose 
a profession in which books will be my daily com- 
panions. So I turn toward teaching. But before 
settling the matter I thought I would ask how you 
regard the profession.” “A noble profession,” I 
answer,“ but quite unfit for you. I would advise you 
to become a lawyer, a car conductor, or something 
equally harmless. Do not turn to anything so peril- 
ous as teaching. You would ruin both it and your- 
self; for you are looking in exactly the wrong 
direction.” 
Such an inquirer is under a common misconcep- 
tion. »The teacher’s task is not primarily the acqui- 
sition of knowledge, but the impartation of it, — an 
entirely different matter. We teachers are forever 
taking thoughts out of our minds and putting them 
elsewhere. So long as we are content to keep them 
in our possession, we are not teachers at all. One 
who is interested in laying hold on wisdom is likely 
to become a scholar. And while no doubt it is well 
for a teacher to be a fair scholar, —I have known 
several such, — that is not the main thing. What con- 
stitytc. the teacher is the passion to make scholars; 
and again and again it happens that the great scholar 
has wo such passion whatever.
-P-A-G-E-16
  10 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
But even that passion is useless without aid from 
imagination. At every instant of the teacher’s life 
he must be controlled by this mighty power. Most 
human beings are contented with living one life 
and delighted if they can pass that agreeably. But 
this is far from enough for us teachers. We inces- 
santly go outside ourselves and enter into the many 
lives aboui us, — lives dull, dark, and unintelligible 
~ to any but an eye like ours. And this is imagination, 
. the sympathetic creation in ourselves of conditions 
which belong to others. Our profession.is.therefore 
a double-ended one. We inspect truth as it rises fresh 
and interesting before our eager sight. But that is 
only the beginning of our task. ySwiftly we then 
seize the lines of least intellectual resistance in alien 
minds and, with perpetual reference to these, fol- 
low our truth till it is safely lodged beyond ourselves. 
Each mind has its peculiar set of frictions. Those 
of our pupils can never be the same as ours. We 
have passed far on and know all about our subject. 
For'us it wears an altogether different look from that 
which it has for beginners. It is their perplexities 
which we must reproduce and — as if a rose should 
shut and be a bud again — we must reassume in our 
developed and accustomed souls something of the 
innocence of childhood. Such is the exquis**=-husi- 
ness of the teacher, to carry himself back with all h* 
wealth of knowledge and understand how his sul  
-P-A-G-E-17
THE IDEAL TEACHER 11 
ject should appear to the meagre mind of one glanc- 
ing at it for the first time. 
And what absurd blunders we make in the process! 
Becoming immersed in our own side of the affair, 
we blind ourselves and readily attribute to our pupils 
modes of thought which are not in the least theirs. 
I remember a lesson I had on this point, I who had 
been teaching ethics half a lifetime. My nephew, 
five years old, was fond of stories from the Odyssey. 
He would creep into bed with me in the morning and 
beg for them. One Sunday, after I had given him 
a pretty stiff bit of adventure, it occurred to me that 
it was an appropriate day for a moral. “Ulysses 
was a very brave man,” I remarked. “ Yes,” he said, 
“and I am very brave.”’ I saw my opportunity and 
seized it. “That is true,” said I. “You have been 
gaining courage lately. You used to cry easily, but 
you don’t do that nowadays. When you want to cry 
now, you think how like a baby it would be to cry, 
or how you would disturb mother and upset the 
house; and so you conclude not to cry.” The little 
fellow seemed hopelessly puzzled. He lay silent a 
minute or two and then said, “Well no, Uncle, I 
don’t do that. I just go sh-sh-sh, and I don’t.” 
There the moral crisis is stated in its simplicity; 
and I had been putting off on that holy little nature 
sophistications borrowed from my own battered life. 
But while I am explaining the blunders caused by
-P-A-G-E-18
12 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
self-engrossment and lack of imagination, let me 
show what slight adjustments will sometimes carry 
as past depressing difficulties. One year when I was 
lecturing on some intricate problems of obligation, 
I began to doubt whether my class was following 
me, and I determined that I would make them talk. 
So the next day I constructed an ingenious ethical 
case and, after stating it to the class, I said, “Sup- 
posing now the state of affairs were thus and thus, 
and the interests of the persons involved were such 
and such, how would you decide the question of right, 
— Mr. Jones.” Poor Jones rose in confusion. “You 
mean,” he said, “if the case were as you have stated 
it? Well, hm, hm, hm,— yes, —I don’t think I know, 
sir.” And he sat down. I called en one and another 
with the same result. A panic was upon them, and 
all their minds were alike empty. I went home dis- 
gusted, wondering whether they had comprehended 
anything I had said during the previous fortnight, 
and hoping I might never have such a stupid lot of 
students again. Suddenly it flashed upon me that it 
was I who was stupid. That is usually the case when 
a class fails; it is the teacher’s fault. The next day 
I went back prepared to begin at the right end. I 
began, “Oh, Mr. Jones.” He rose, and I proceeded 
to state the situation as before. By the time I paused 
he had collected his wits, had worked off his super- 
fluous flurry, and was ready to give me an admirable
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE IDEAL TEACHER 13 
answer. Indeed in a few minutes the whole class was 
engaged in an eager discussion. My previous error 
had been in not remembering that they, I, and every- 
body, when suddenly attacked with a big question, 
are not in the best condition for answering. Occupied 
as I was with my end of the story, the questioning 
end, I had not worked in that double-ended fashion 
which alone can bring the teacher success; in short, 
I_was deficient in vicariousness, —in swiftly put- 
ting myself in the weak one’s place and bearing his 
burden. 
Now it is in this chief business of the artistic 
teacher, to labor imaginatively himself in order to 
diminish the labors of his slender pupil, that most 
of our failures occur. Instead of lamenting the im- 
perviousness of our pupils, we had better ask our- 
selves more frequently whether we have neatly ad- 
justed our teachings to the conditions of their minds. 
We have no right to tumble out in a mass whatever 
comes into our heads, leaving to that feeble folk the 
work of finding in it what order they may. (Ours 
_ it should be to see that every beginning, middle, and 
end of what we say is helpfully shaped for readiest 
access to those less intelligent and interested than we. 
But this is vicariousness. Noblesse oblige. In this.

his past failures have been due to the absence of 
not commit that blunder again. On going to his 
class to-morrow he will look out upon his subject 
with his pupils’ eyes, not with his own. Let him at- 
tempt it, and his pupils will surely say to one another, 
“What is the matter to-day with teacher?” They 
will get nothing from that exercise. No, what is 
wanted is ugh aresglve, but an aptitude. The time 
for using vicariousness is not thetime for acquiring 
‘it. Rather it is the time for dismissing all thoughts 
of it from the mind. (On entering the classroom we

But into that nature vicariousness should long ago 
_have been wrought. It should be already on hand. 
Fortunate we if our great-grandmother supplied us 
with it before we were born. There are persons 
who, with all good will, can never be teachers. They 
are not made in that way. Their business it is to 
pry into knowledge, to engage in action, to make 
money, or to pursue whatever other aim their powers 
dictate; but they do not readily think in terms of 
the other person. They should not, then, be teach- 
eo 
The teacher’s habit is well summed in the Apos- 
tle’s rule, “Look not every man on his own things, 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
THE IDEAL TEACHER 15 
but every man also” — it is double — “on the things 
of others.” And this habit should become as nearly 
as possible an instinct. Until it is rendered in- 
stinctive and passes beyond conscious direction, it 
will be of little worth. Let us then, as we go into 
society, as we walk the streets, as we sit at table, 
practice altruistic. limberaess and learn to escape 
from ourselves, \A true teacher is always meditating 
his work, disciplining himself for his profession, . 
probing the problems of his glorious art, and seeing 
gillustration of them everywhere. In only one place 
. is he freed from such criticism, and that is in his 
classroom. Here in the moment of action he lets 
himself go, unhampered by theory, using the nature 
acquired elsewhere, and uttering as simply as pos- 
sible the fulness of his mind and heart. Direct human 
intercourse requires instinctive aptitudes. ‘Till al- 
truistic vicariousness has become our second nature, 
we shall not deeply influence anybody. 
But sympathetic imagination is not all a teacher 
needs. Exclusive aljruism is absurd. On this point 
too I once got instruction from the mouths of babes 
and sucklings. The children of a friend of mine, 
children of six and four, had just gone to bed. Their 
mother overheard them talking when they should 
have been asleep. Wondering what they might need, 
she stepped into the entry and listened. They were 
discussing what they were here in the world for.
-P-A-G-E-22
   
  16 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
That is about the size of problems commonly found 
in infant minds. The little girl suggested that we are 
probably in the world to help others. “Why, no 
indeed, Mabel,” said her big brother, “for then what 
would others be here for?” Precisely! If anything 
is only fit to give away, it is not fit for that. We must 
know and prize its goodness in ourselves before 
generosity is even possible. 
fx” Plainly, then, beside his aptitude for vicariousness, 
‘our Ydeal teacher will need the second qualification 
of an already accumulated wealth. These hungry 
pupils are drawing all their nourishment from us, 
and have we got it to give? They will be poor, if we 
are poor; rich if we are wealthy. We are their source 
of supply. Every time we cut ourselves off from 
nutrition, we enfeeble them. And how frequently 
devoted teachers make this mistake! dedicating 
themselves so to the immediate needs of those about 
them that they themselves grow thinner each year. 
We all know the ‘“‘teacher’s face.” It is meagre, 
worn, sacrificial, anxious, powerless. That is exactly 
the opposite of what it should be. The teacher should 
be the big bounteous being of the community. Other 
people may get along tolerably by holding whatever 
small knowledge comes their way. A moderate stock 
will pretty well serve their private turn. But that is 
not our case. Supplying a multitude, we need wealth 
sufficient for a multitude. We should then be clutch- 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  THE IDEAL TEACHER 17 
ing at knowledge on every side. Nothing must es- 
capeus. Itis a mistake to-reject-a bit-of truth because 
it lies outside our.province. Some day we shall need 
it. All knowledge is our province. 
In preparing a lecture I find I always have to 
work hardest on the things I do not say. The things 
I am sure to say I can easily get up. They are 
obvious and generally accessible. But they, I find, 
are not enough. I must have a broad background 
of knowledge which does not appear in speech. I 
have to go over my entire subject and see how the 
things I am to say look in their various relations, 
tracing out connections which I shall not present 
to my class. One might ask what is the use of this? 
Why prepare more matter than can be used? Every 
successful teacher knowsAI cannot teach right up 
to the edge of my knowledge withoui a fear of falling 
off. My pupils discover this fear, and my words 
are ineffective. They feel the influence of what I 
do not say. One cannot precisely explain it; but 
when I move freely across my subject as if it-mat- 
tered little on what part of it I rest, they get a sense 
of assured power which is compulsive and fructify- 
ing. The subject acquires consequence, their minds 
swell, and they are eager to enter regions of which 
they had not previously thought. 
Even, then, to teach a small thing well we must 
be large. I asked a teacher what her subject was,
-P-A-G-E-24
  18 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
and she answered, “ Arithmetic in the third grade.” 
But where is the third grade found? In knowledge, | 
or in the schools? Unhappily it is in the schools. 
But if one would be a teacher of arithmetic, it must 
be arithmetic she teaches and not third grade at all. 
We cannot accept these artificial bounds without 
damage. Instead of accumulated wealth they will 
bring us accumulated poverty, and increase it every 
day. Years ago at Harvard we began to discuss the 
establishment of a Graduate School; and I, a young 
instructor, steadily voted against it. My thought was 
this: Harvard. College, in spite of what the pub- 
lic imagines, is a place of slender resources. Our 
means are inadequate for teaching even under- 
graduates. But graduate instruction is vastly more 
expensive ; courses composed of half a dozen students 
take the time of the ablest professors. I thought 
we could not afford this. Why not leave graduate 
instruction to a university which gives itself entirely 
to that task ? Would it not be wiser to spend ourselves 
on the lower ranges of learning, covering these ade- 
quately, than to try to spread. ourselves-over the en- 
tire field? ne 
Doubting so, I for some time opposed the coming 
of a Graduate School. But a luminous remark of 
our great President showed me the error of my 
ways. In the course of debate he said one even- 
ing, “It is not primarily for the graduates that
-P-A-G-E-25
* 
THE IDEAL TEACHER 19 
I care for this school; it is for the undergraduates. 
We shall never get good teaching here so long as our 
instructors set a limit to their subjects. When they 
are called on to follow these throughout, tracing 
them far off toward the unknown, they may become 
good teachers; but not before.” 
I went home meditating. I saw that the President 
was right, and that I was myself in danger of the 
stagnation he deprecated. I changed my vote, as 
“did others. 'The Graduate School was established; 
and of all the influences which have contributed to 
raise the standard of scholarship at Harvard, both 
for teachers and taught, that graduate work seems 
to me the greatest. Every professor now must be 
the master of a field of knowledge, and not of a few 
paths running through it. 
But the ideal teacher will accumulate wealth, 
not merely for his pupils’ sake, but for his own. 
f great teacher one must be a great personality, 
and without ardent and individual tastes the roots 
of our being are not fed. For developing personal 
power it is well, therefore, for each teacher to culti« 
vate interests unconnected with his official work. Let 
the mathematician turn to the English poets, the 
teacher of classics to the study of birds and flowers, 
and each will gain a lightness, a freedom from 
exhaustion, a mental hospitality, which can only 
be acquired in some disinterested pursuit. Such a       
-P-A-G-E-26

private subject becomes doubly dear because it is 
just our own. We pursue it as we will; we let it call 
out our irresponsible thoughts; and from it we ordi- 
narily carry off a note of distinction lacking in those 
whose lives are too tightly organized. 
'o this second qualification of the teacher, how- 
ever, I have been obliged to prefix a condition simi- 
lar to that which was added to the first. We need not 
merely wealth, but an alr. ccumulated wealth. 
At the moment when wealth is wanted it cannot be 
acquired. It should have been gathered and stored 
before the occasion arose. What is more pitiable 
than when a person who desires to be a benefactor 
looks in his chest and finds it empty? Special know- 
ledge is wanted, or trained insight, or professional 
skill, or sound practical judgment; and the teacher 
‘who is called on has gone through no such discipline 
as assures these resources.( I am inclined to think 
that women are more liable to this sort of bankruptcy 
than . Their sex is more sympathetic than ours 
and they spend more hastily. They will drop what 
they are doing and run if a baby cries. Excellence 
requires a certain hardihood of heart, while quick 
responsiveness is destructive of the larger giving. 
He who would be greatly generous must train him- 
self long and tenaciously, without much attention 
by which he took thirty years for acquisition and

three for bestowal, is not unwise, provided that we 
too can say, “ For their sakes I sanctify myself.” 
But the two qualifications of the teacher already 
named will not alone suffice. I have known persons 
who were sympathetically imaginative, and who 
could not be denied to possess, la i { \ aoe 
wealth, who still failed as teachers¥ One needs a third 
something, the _ to invigorate life through Jearn- 
ing. We do notalways notice how knowledge nat- 
urally buffets. It is offensive stuff, and makes young 
and wholesome minds rebel. And well it may; for 
_ when we learn anything, we are obliged to break up 
' the world, inspect it piecemeal, and let our minds 
seize it bit by bit. Now about a fragment there is 
always something repulsive. Any one who is nor- 
mally constituted must draw back in horror, feeling 
that what is brought him has little to do with the 
beautiful world he has known. Where was there 
ever a healthy child w. did not hate the multipli- 
cation table? A boy who did not detest such ab- 
stractions as seven times eight would hardly be worth 
educating. By no ingenuity can we relieve knowledge 
of this unfortunate peculiarity. It must be taken in 
disjointed portions. That is the way attention is 
made. In consequence each of us must be to some 
extent a specialist, devoting himself to certain sides 
of the world and neglecting others quite as important. 
These are the conditions under which we imperfect 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
22 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
creatures work. Our sight is not world-wide. When 
we give our attention to one object, by that very 
act we withdraw it from others. In this way our 
children must learn and have their expansive natures 
subdued to pedagogic exigencies. 
Because this belittlement through the method of 
approach is inevitable, it is all-important that the 
teacher should possess a supplemental dignity, re- 
placing the oppressive sense of pettiness with stimu- 
lating intimations of high things in store. Partly 
on this account a book is an imperfect instructor. 
Truth there, being impersonal, seems untrue, ab- 
stract, and insignificant. It needs to shine through 
a human being before it can exert its vital force on a 
young student. Quite as much for vital transmission 
__as for intellectual elucidation, is a teacher employed. 
His consolidated character exhibits the gains which 
come from study. He need not point them out. If 
he is a scholar, there will appear in him an august- 
ness, accuracy, fulness of knowledge, a buoyant— 
enthusiasm even in drudgery, and an unshakable 
confidence that others must soon see and enjoy what 
has enriched himself; and all this will quickly con- 
vey itself to his students and create attention in his 
classroom. Such kindling of interest is the great 
function of the teacher. People sometimes say, “I 
should like to teach if only pupils cared to learn.” 
But then there would be little need of teaching.

to teachers. ¢ i is wi oO are 
unawakened._ In the Sistine Chapel Michael Angelo 
has depicted the Almighty moving in clouds over 
the rugged earth where lies the newly created Adam, 
hardly aware of himself. The tips of the fingers 
touch, the Lord’s and Adam’s, and the huge frame 
loses its inertness and rears itself into action. Such 
may be the electrifying touch of the teacher. 
But it must be confessed that not infrequently, 
instead of invigorating life through knowledge, we 
teachers reduce our classes to complete passivity. 
The blunder is not altogether ours, but is suggested 
by certain characteristics of knowledge itself: for 
how can a learner begin without submitting his 
mind, accepting facts, listening to authority, in 
short se obedient? He is called on to 2

two sides of knowledge, information and intelligence, 
he is to keep the balance true, While a boy is taking 
in facts, facts not allowed to be twisted by any fancy 
or carelessness, he is all the time to be made to 
feel that these facts offer him a field for critical 
and constructive action. If they leave him inactive, 
docile, and plodding, there is something wrong with 
the teaching. Facts are pernicious when they subju- 
gate and do not quicken the mind that grasps them. 
[Education should unfold us and truth together; and_ 
to enable it to do so the learner must never be allowed 
to sink into a mere recipient. He should be called 
on to think, to observe, to form his own judgments, even_at the risk of error_and crudity. Temporary 
one-sidedness and extravagance is not too high a 
price to pay for originality. And this development 
of personal vigor, emphasized in our day by the elec- 
tive svStem_ and independent, research vis the

I have said that knowledge buffets, forcing us into | 
an almost slavish attitude, and that this is resented | 
by vigorous natures. In almost every school some : 
of the most original, aggressive, and independent 
boys stand low in their classes, while at the top 
stand “grinds,” — objects of horror to all healthy 
souls.

ifsimply given something to do. Until the mind 
‘eacts for itself on what it receives, its education is

The teacher who leads it so to react may be truly 
called “productive,” productive of human beings.

and corrupted, and is now hardly more than a piece 
of educational slang. According to the judgments 
of to-day a teacher may be unimaginative, pedantic, 
dull, and may make his students no less so; he will 
still deserve a crown of wild olive as a “ productive” 
man if he neglects his classroom for the printing press. 
But this is to put first things second and second 
things first. He who is original and fecund, and 
knows how to beget a similar spirit in his students, 
will naturally wish to express himself beyond his 
classroom. By snatching the fragments of time 
which his arduous work allows, he may accomplish 
much worthy writing and probably increase too his 
worth for his college, his students, and himself. But -- 
the business of book-making is, after all collateral 
with us teachers. Not for this are we employed, de- 
sirable though it is for showing the kind of mind we 
bear. Many of my most productive colleagues have 
printed little or nothing, though they have left a deep 
mark on the life and science of our time. I would 
encourage publication. It keeps the solitary student 
healthy, enables him to find his place among his 
fellows, and more distinctly to estimate the contri- 
butions he is making to his subject. But let him never 
neglect his proper work for that which must always 
have in it an element of advertising.

ble, section of my paper. Briefly it is this: af teacher

_> must have a readiness to be forgotten. And what is 
harder? We may be excellent persons, may be daily 
doing kindnesses, and yet not be quite willing to 
have those kindnesses overlooked. Many a man is 
ready to be generous, if by it he can win praise. The 
love of praise, — it is almost our last infirmity; but 
there is no more baffling infirmity for the teacher. 
If praise and recognition are dear to him, he may 
as well stop work. Dear to him perhaps they must 
be, as a human being; but as a teacher, he is called 
on to rise above ordinary human conditions. Who- 
ever has followed me thus far will perceive the rea- 
son. I have shown that aulencheslacs nol ne-tar— 
imself, but for his for the t 
imparts. His aim is to be a colorless medium oieh 
which that truth may shine on opening minds. How 
- can he be this if he is continually interposing him- 
self and saying, “ Instead of looking at the truth, my 
children, look at me and see how skilfully I do my 
work. I thought I taught you admirably to-day. I 
hope you thought so too.” No, the teacher must 
keep himself entirely out of the way, fixing young 
attention on the proffered knowledge and not on 
anything so small as the one who brings it. Only 
so can he be vicarious, whole-hearted in invigorating | 
the lives committed to his charge. 
Moreover, any other course is futile. We cannot 
tell whether those whom we are teaching have taken

~~ THE IDEAL TEACHER 27 
  our best points or not. Those best points, what are 
they? We shall count them one thing, our pupils 
another. We gather what seems to us of consequence 
and pour it out upon our classes. But if their minds 
are not fitted to receive it, the little creatures have 
excellent protective arrangements which they draw 
down, and all we pour is simply shed as if nothing 
had fallen; while again we say something so slight 
that we hardly notice it, but, happening to be just 
the nutritive element which that small life then 
needs, it is caught up and turned into human fibre. 
We cannot tell. We work in the dark. Out upon 
the waters our bread is cast, and if we are wise we 
do not attempt to trace i ea

Empiricism I undertook a line of exposition which 
I knew was abstruse. Indeed, I doubted if many 
of the class could follow; but there on the front seat 
sat one whose bright eyes were ever upon me. It 
seemed worth while to teach my three or four best 
men, that man in particular. By the end of the term 
there were many grumblings. My class did not get 
much out of me that year. They graduated, and a 
couple of years later this young fellow appeared at 
my door to say that he could not pass through Cam- 
_ bridge without thanking me for his work on Locke, 
Berkeley, and Hume. Pleased to be assured that
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
my questionable methods were justified, and unwill- 
ing to drop a subject so agreeable, I asked if he 
could tell precisely where the value of the course lay. 
“Certainly,” he answered. “It all centred in a single 
remark of Locke’s. Locke said we ought to have 
clear and distinct ideas. I don’t think I got anything 
else OutOf the course.” Well, at first I was inclined to think the fellow 
foolish, so to mistake a bit of commonplace for gos- 
pel truth. Why did he not listen to some of the pro- 
found things I was saying? But on reflection I saw 
that he was right and I wrong. That trivial saying 
had come to him at a critical moment as a word of 
power; while the deep matters which interested me, 
and which I had been offering him so confidently 
day by day, being unsuited to him, had passed him 
by. He had not heard them. 
To such proper unthankfulness we teachers must 
accustom ourselves. We cannot tell what are our 
good deeds, and shall only plague ourselves and 
hinder our classes if we try to find out. Let us dis- 
play our subjects as lucidly as possible, allow our 
pupils considerable license in apprehension, and be 
content ourselves to escape observation. But though 
what we do remains unknown, its results often awake 
deep affection. Few in the community receive love 
more abundantly than we. Wherever we go, we 
meet a smiling face. Throughout the world, by

some good fortune, the period of learning is the 
period of romance. In those halcyon days of our 
boys and girls we have a share, and the golden lights 
which flood the opening years are reflected on us. 
Though our pupils cannot follow our efforts in their 
behalf, and indeed ought not, — it being our art to 
conceal our art, — yet they perceive that in the years 
when their happy expansion occurred we were their 
guides. To us, therefore, their blind affections cling 
as to few beside their parents. It is better to be loved 
than to be understood. 
Perhaps some readers of this paper will begin to 
suspect that it is impossible to be a good teacher. 
Certainlyit is. Eachof the four qualifications Ihave 
named is endless. Not-one of them—can-be——fully_at- 
-tained. We.can always be more imaginative, wealthy, stimulating, disinterested, Each year we creep a 
little nearer to our goal, only to find that a finished 
teacher is a contradiction in terms. Our reach will 
forever exceed our grasp. Yet what a delight in 
approximation! Even in our failures there is com- 
fort, when we see that they are generally due not to 
technical but to personal defects. We have been put- 
ting ourselves forward, or have taught in mechanical 
rather than vital fashion, or have not undertaken 
betimes the labor of preparation, or have declined the 
trouble of vicariousness. 
Evidently, then, as we become better teachers we )
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 THE IDEAL TEACHER 
also become in some sort better persons. Our beau- 
tiful art, being so largely personal, will at last be 
seen to connect itself with nearly all other employ- 
ments. Every mother is a teacher. Every minister. 
The lawyer teaches the jury, the doctor his patient. 
The clever salesman might almost be said to use 
teaching in dealing with his customer, and all of us 
to be teachers of one another in daily intercourse. As 
teaching_is the most universal of the professions, 
those are fortunate _who le to devote their 
lives to its enriching study.

INTRODUCTION 
School supervision in the United States is recognized 
as a definite rank of professional service. This profess 
come into existence in response to the peculiar demands or our 
American communities, and owes its origin and characte 
genius of our American institutions. In no other cou 
we find an educational office that corresponds in its du 
requirements to that of the American superintendent o 
schools. 
It has been only within the last few years that s 
phasis has been placed upon the qualifications and du 
school superintendent. At first it was too common) 
tiee to divorce the work of supervision from that o: 
This was especially true with regard to the supervisic 
schools. But there are few communities in this coun 
urban or rural, in which the people do not recognize 
mental principle that real supervision involves rea: 
and that the expert superintendent must first of all be 
teacher. ‘To the progressive recognition of this priz 
be attributed the rapid development of our edueatior 
during the past decade. Those charged with the insy 
supervision of our schools to-day must be men who nave come

from the ranks; they must be fitted by experience and study to 
lead their teachers, and to develop skill and teaching power in 
the individual, by practical demonstration as well as by counsel 
and advice. Besides, the memory of their own trials and diffi- 
culties is calculated to make them more practical and sym- 
pathetie with the struggling young teacher. 
A second principle is also quite generally recognized to-day: 
While the superintendent must be a teacher, he must. be some- 
thing more.. The scope of the teacher’s work may be limited 
to a class or a specific subject. The superintendent’s field of 
vision must inelude all classes and all the topics of the cur- 
riculum, He must be able to comprehend not only things, but 
relations as weil. It is not enough for him to be familiar with 
stibjects; he. must have power to correlate these subjects in a 
consistent course of study, to estimate their specific educational 
values, and to preserve both in matter and method pedagogical 
unity and proportion. 
The third prineiple in school supervision involves the busi- 
ness or administrative element. Aside from his professional 
fitness, the school superintendent must. be a man of affairs. 
Even in his relations to teachers and pupils he must. possess a 
degree of business sense and executive power. He must be able 
te plan and to bring things to pass. In his relations to the 
Board of Education and the community he must have business 
ability of no mean order. The publie is far more likely to 
deteet the want of economy in methods which may be measured 
by dollars and cents, than in the more subtle processes which 
must be valued by their mental and ethical results. 
On the practical side it is assumed that the work of super- 
vision requires a substantial basis of experience in teaching.

Introduction vii . 
‘The wider the range of this experience, the better and the 
broader will be the foundation. On the other hand, too much 
emphasis cannot be placed upon the theoretical side of the 
superintendent’s preparation. The man who shapes the educa- 
tional policy and moulds the destiny of a community should be 
a practical student of psychology and of the theory and history 
of education. In order to inspire and train the teachers under 
his direction, and in order to develop in them the right spirit 
and the true ideal of their work, the superintendent must be 
masterful in theory as well as in practice. ‘ 
While there are many excellent institutions in which this 
general preparation for supervision may be obtained, it is to 
be regretted that there is none in which the young superin- 
tendent can get training and instruction in the more specific 
duties of the profession. Possibly it is too much to expect this 
species of training from any institution in the present stage of 
educational development. The fact that the opportunities are 
offered in a number of our summer schools for this preparation, 
indicates the growing recognition of its importance. It is some- 
what surprising, however, that so few practical hand books have 
been prepared, embodying in general outline, the ideals and 
practical duties of the superintendent. 
The publication of this course of lectures by Superintendent 
Evans will be hailed with pleasure by those who are entrusted 
with the work of school supervision in the smaller cities of this 
country, as well as by those who are charged with the destiny 
of our rural schools. The author of these lectures is fortunate 
in that his long experience includes the supervision of rural as 
well as city schools. These lectures are admirably sane and 
suggestive. Much of their value will be found in the author’s

conservatism and in his freedom from that dogmatism which 
seeks, too often, to crystallize educational theory and method 
into the saneless routine of a mechanical system. The lec- 
turer’s zeal and enthusiasm are invariably guided by a whole- 
some common sense, and his treatment is characterized through- 
out by such philosophical and ethical considerations as are cal- 
culated to render them effective for inspiration as well as for 
instruction.

PREFACE 
School supervision, which is so closely related to education, 
is necessarily receiving greatly increased attention, especially 
so in this transitional and constructive stage of the great educa- 
tional movement in the Southern states. By reason of this 
greater stress on supervision and the increasing difficulties and 
problems connected therewith, our Southern superintendents 
will gladly welcome a work that has been the product of South- 
ern conditions, and has grown out of the experience of one who 
inas for many years been serving in the capacity of both a city 
and county superintendent. Just such a work the Southern 
Edueational Review is offering to the public and especially to 
the superintendents. The Review is under great obligations to 
Superintendent J. H. Phillips, of Birmingham, Ala., for 
writing the introduction; and to Superintendent R. J. Tighe, 
of Asheville, N. C., for a critical review of the manuseript and 
fer many valuable suggestions.

Lectures on School Supervision 
/ Lecture J 
THE QUALIFICATIONS, PREPARATION AND 
POWERS OF A SUPERINTENDENT . 
The time is passing when just anybody will do for a leader 
of teachers. Of late years there is a protest against untrained 
workers in the office of school supervision. The influence of 
the politician in placing his friends, the cry of the needy gen- 
tlewoman that she must have work, the demand that indigent 
relatives, shall be cared for, are growing less in the face of the 
stern resolve of the parents and public that their children shall 
not be tutored by tyros. 
Teaching is now a profession. One of its departments is 
superintendence. Just anybody may keep school, but real 
teaching is another thing. Just anybody may hold office, but 
real superintending is different. , 
He Makes the Standard. The superintendent sets the educa- 
tional standard for his people. The schools are known as hig 
schools. If they are good he deserves the credit. If they are 
poor he gets the blame. There is no way of shifting the respon- 
sibility to other shoulders. It belongs to him, and if he is not
-P-A-G-E-10
12 Lectures on ScHoon SUPERVISION 
the responsible party then he is not the superintendent. A 
school system will not rise above its leader, for he is the foun- 
tain head of its waters. Let us understand in the beginning 
that we hold the superintendent responsible for whatever goes 
on in his school system. He must get control of the situation 
and must set the pace or else he merely holds office. 
He Does the Thinking. He is employed to do the thinking 
and the planning for the schools, and should have the ability to 
do it. He should keep ahead of everybody in his community in 
school matters, and at the same time should be careful not to 
get out of sight or hearing of his people. He should lead though 
the pace may be slow at times in order that all may follow. 
Somebody will do the thinking and planning, and if that some- 
body is not the superintendent the system runs wild, and things 
may happen. The only salvation is for the superintendent to 
be prompt and wise and strong. Then he may announce that he 
has a plan and a way, he has thought it out and studied over 
it, and he proposes to see it through, or know the reason why. 
Then the people pay attention, the teachers turn their eyes on 
him, and the Board understands that they have not employed a 
figure head or paid out their money for nothing. Everybody 
admires a man with ideas, and is willing for a strong man to 
have his way. 
The day has passed when teaching apologizes to any other 
profession. It depends largely upon the superintendent to 
dignify the schools of his community by believing in and assert- 
ing the worthiness of the profession, by conducting himself in 
such a way as to prove the faith that is in him. If he does not 
believe in-his schools, nobody else will. If he does not respect 
and dignify his calling, others will hold it in contempt. As the 
superintendent, so are the schools. Everybody takes the cue
-P-A-G-E-11
THe QUALIFICATIONS OF A SUPERINTENDENT 13 
from his conduct, his words, his faith. Let him be noble and 
worthy and the schools move up to his standard. : 
He Should Know Good Teaching. It might also be added that 
he should know poor teaching when he sees it. After a while it 
becomes a matter of instinct with him, and the moment he 
enters a school room, the very atmosphere, the appearance of 
things, the faces of the children, and the teacher herself, all 
betray at the glance the grade of the work. It is locking at the 
thermometer, a glance shows the temperature. If he has not this 
instinct then he is without pedagogical sense. It is not in him 
and ean never be put in him. Nor can this instinct be defined, 
or explained, any more than harmony can be defined to one de- 
void of musical sense. 
Be a Student. ‘The superintendent should be a student of 
school affairs. It is all very well to talk about general culture, 
by general réading, but this is.the day of specialties, and if a 
superintendent is to know education, he must read education. 
There is a literature as wide and profound and varied on this 
subject as on any subject, and a good superintendent should 
master the literature of his business. Then he should know 
what is going on in the school world, what experiments are try- 
ing elsewhere and with what results, and what recent deduc- 
tions have been made from extended observations. He should 
know where his schools stand in relation to other schools, 
whether he is ahead or behind, and where his excellencies and 
defects are as compared with them. The higher he rises in the 
contemplation of school matters, the farther he can see. 
Know Books. A book is but a means and a help to a good 
teacher, but a good book isa better means and a greater help than 
a poor book. Therefore a superintendent should know school | 
books: While it is true that good teaching may be done with a
-P-A-G-E-12
14 Lectures oN Scnoou SuPERVISION 
poor book or with no book at all, yet for most teachers the best 
text-book is none too good. Of late years the publishers have 
been issuing wonderful products of school book making and a 
superintendent could almost shut his eyes, reach out and get a 
good text, if he had only the late ones before him. However, he 
should know the teachable qualities of a good text book. 
Know Methods. It is not safe to say that a superintendent 
should necessarily be a great teacher, any more than a teacher of 
veeal music should be a great singer, but it is safe to say that 
he should know how teaching should be done, and be capable 
of saying and showing how it should be done. He should be a 
competent critic, though it is easy to see that certain of his 
teachers could do better work in the grades. He should always 
he ready with wise and helpful advice, and prove his wisdom 
by showing that it is based on sound pedagogical principles. 
There is today a system of teaching, methodology in the profes- 
sion, based on fundamental principles of child life. These are 
explained in the books on the subject and are exemplified in 
the best schools. It is this that the superintendent should know, 
end be prepared to explain and expound to his teachers. They 
are not tricks nor short cuts, nor royal roads to learning, but 
they are the right ways of teaching children, so that most profit 
can be gained for them in the shortest time. 
Travel. One of the best ways to learn good methods is to be 
where they are used. A superintendent needs to travel, to visit, 
to see others at work doing the right thing. He needs to attend 
a pedagogical clinic, and see the masters at work. He there 
drinks it in with every sense and absorbs the spirit by breathing 
the atmosphere, charged with the tonic of great work. Nothing 
is so narrowing as staying at home and looking at one’s self. No 
better help can come to a superintendent than to leave his low
-P-A-G-E-13

vaulted environment, and get out into the open where he can 
breathe and grow. Therefore, let him go where great lights are 
illuminating great themes by lectures and discussions. Let him 
sit the day through in the presence of a school where the right 
thing is doing in the right way, This will make him humble; 
but it will help to make him great. 
He Should Have a Plan. Every superintendent should have 
an ultimate plan and should work out his system in accordance. 
He should know where he is going and add a bit year by year, 
toward its attainments. He should not work in the dark nor. 
at hap-hazard, but definitely. He should announce his plan, 
and enthuse his people for its early accomplishment. Let him 
state boldly and definitely what his people need, and they will 
become as impatient as he is, to see the result. Let him have 
an end in view, a complete plan, an aim, and if he be wise and 
enthusiastic, the community gathers momentum like water down 
hill. 
Be Sane. A superintendent should be thoroughly sane. This 
is not inconsistent with enthusiasm and devotion to his work, 
but it recognizes that other people have rights, and have good 
ideas, and that there are more ways than one. Let us remem- 
ber that wisdom is the principal thing—and patience. Once let 
people think he is a crank and he is lost. He must remember 
that he is to work through the people for their own good, and to 
that end he must retain their good will, their respect and their 
regard. If he is obstinate and domineering, and wants his way 
without proving that it is the best way, they set him down for 
a fool and that ends it. They get another man who is more 
adroit. Therefore a good superintendent does a good deal of 
listening, and smiles as he listens. He is as patient as he can 
be, and takes everybody’s troubles as his own, and is never
-P-A-G-E-14
16 Lectures on ScHooL SUPERVISION 
vexed with foolish suggestions. He merely keeps his counsel, 
bides his time, proves his case and has his own way. 
Be Strong. Every school system needs a strong hand to 
guide it, a strong head to think for it, and a strong nature to lean 
on. The schoo! system grows around the superintendent. He 
is its support, and tower of strength. Everything should look 
up to him and should depend upon him.. Everything radiates 
from him, and he is responsible for everything that goes on. 
Therefore, he should be reliable. Whatever he says to one 
should not be denied to another. He should have the courage 
to declare himself, when it is time to speak, and having declared 
himself let him stand by it. Weak, unreliable, vacillating men 
are not good supports. They are not to be depended on. What- 
ever the superintendent. says, goes. It can be relied on, and 
he is not afraid to stand by his utterances, for he does not expect 
to deny or retract them. Therefore again, he had best be careful 
how he talks and what he says. Let him weigh his words, so that 
he may not have to retract or apologize or explain. One of the 
greatest virtues in any man is that he can be relied on, whether it 
be to speak the truth, or declare his mind, or keep forever still, 
ot redeem his promise, or stand by a friend, or what not—so that 
he may be found just where he belongs when he is wanted. 
Be Fair. Judges are supposed to act without prejudice or 
passion, or partiality and with due deliberation and caution. It 
is not a bad idea to reserve most decisions for deliberation and 
thought, but having once delivered them they should stand as 
law. In the contact with teachers they should be treated with 
fairness and without prejudice. The good qualities of the poor 
ones should be recognized and the best ones are not without their 
faults. It should be understood that the superintendent can be 
appealed to for due consideration and just treatment, no matter
-P-A-G-E-15
Tue QuatiFications oF a ScHooL SUPERINTENDENT 17 
what is the point at issue. He should train himself to perform 
this office. : 
Be Agreeable. Some men think that official dignity requires 
an anstere face and severe tones, and that a cold, frightful man- 
ner is a sure way to make an impression. They confound real 
and serious dignity, with assumed mannerism, and in this way 
they make a mistake. Dignity is a noble word, and a worthy 
trait, and it comes from the due consideration of one’s responsi- - 
bility and influence. It is a trait that cannot bé assumed, We 
attain to it by being constantly mindful of the effect upon others 
of our undue levity, as well as mindful that people often meas- 
ure an office by the conduct and character of the man that holds 
it, 
Teachers should never feel fear of their superintendent. They 
should not be alarmed and frightened at the prospects of his visit 
to their schools, nor apprehensive of what he might say about 
them. They should feel that he is going to make his criticisms 
to their faces, and pay them compliments to others. It is always 
a bad sign when the teacher trembles and gets pale and nervous 
when her best friend, the superintendent comes around. One 
time I heard a good woman, once a teacher, now a happily mar- 
ried mother, say, “I shall never get over my absolute dread of 
that man. He was the principal of the building’in which I 
‘taught school, and he scared me nearly to death every time he 
walked in. I used to feel then that I had been ‘caught in the 
act’ and T still feel so every time I see him.” 
One Man Power. He should be the undisputed head of the 
school system. What he says should be the law and gospel to the 
teachers under his supervision. He is in charge of the teaching 
force. He is to the schools what the superintendent is to a mill. 
He runs the system. He is paid to do so, and should be allowed —
-P-A-G-E-16
18 LectTuREs on Scroon SuPERVISION 
cnough liberty to make the teachers feel his power, and the 
schools receive the imprints of his ideas. There is value in one 
man power. A wise school committee will select the best super- 
intendent they can find, pay him well, give him plenty of room 
to work in, and hold him responsible for results. A half dozen 
men cannot run a school system. It requires but one man, and be 
needs watching. Therefore no teacher should be encouraged or 
allowed to run to the board members with requests and com- 
plaints seeking to go behind the superintendent or get favors 
not otherwise to be had. A wise board will refer all such matters 
te their proper place. 
Select the Teachers. Every superintendent should be called 
upon by his board to prepare a list of eligible candidates for 
positions in the schools. This list should contain the names of 
all those whose work the superintendent can guarantee to be 
satisfactory. From this list the board should by its own formal 
resolution bind themselves to select the teachers. In this way 
the superintendent has the opportunity of saying who shal] not 
teach, and the board has the chance to say which among a num- 
ber of good ones, shall be the particular ones to teach. It 18 4 
fair compromise and is safe in the hands of a fair minded super- 
intendent. 
Train the Teachers. All matters of method belong to the 
province of the superintendent, and to.a degree the methods of 
instruction and managment should be uniform throughout a 
school system. This is quite consistent with the individual lib- 
erty on the part of the teachers. This is the reason why we: 
have urged that the superintendent should know school methods, 
otherwise he could not guide or direct. It is safe for the super- 
intendent to annoutice to his teachers that they are responsible to 
him for their results, they are to follow his plans of teaching and
-P-A-G-E-17
THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT 19 
government, and he is the one to be pleased or displeased with 
what they do. 
Select the Books. It is his business to know good school books, 
and it should be his affair to decide which are to be used in his 
schools. No matter how excellent the membership of a school 
board, it is not their business to know the qualities of school 
books, and they should not presume to decide. They know other 
things, but school books is not in their line. It should be useless 
to say that a superintendent will probably take counsel of the 
best teachers regarding books, that adoptions will only be made 
after mature-consideration, and that changes will be made only 
when necessary. And still more useless to warn them against ~ 
the specious arguments of too insistent agents, whose persuasive- 
ness often elicits a promise that is afterwards fulfilled with 
regret. It is generally a good idea to say, “I will think this over 
and write to you about it.” 
As a general proposition, the powers of the superintendent 
extend over the inside affairs of the schools. He selects, and 
trains and manages the teachers, looks after the text-books and 
course of study, decides upon methods of instruction, keeps up 
the supplies, and concerns himself, with supervision of what is 
going on. All this he can do, and yet keep in full touch with 
the people and with the great educational world beyond his own 
horizon. 
Supervising. The purpose of a superintendent is to supervise 
the schools and this cannot be done so long as he stays in his 
oftice and attends to other matters. If he has to do this in the 
nature of his special office, then he must have the supervision 
done for him, and under his plans and orders. But no super- 
intendent, however great or busy, should fail to keep in contact
-P-A-G-E-18
20 Lectures on Scuoo, SUPERVISION 
with his work, and this can only be done by going into the 
schools and abiding with the workers. 
It has been discussed at length how much supervision one 
man can do and it has been decided that it all depends—some 
men can do more, and some teachers need more. But as a rough 
estimate of the average man and an average system let us say 
fifty teachers is a good allowance for one man to worry over. 
But the above figures are by no means certain, for as was said, 
it all depends. 
There is a supervision that merely sits around and says noth- 
ing, and goes away leaving a distinct feeling of disapproval 
behind it. This supervision does not supervise. To be real it 
should be live and active and interested and helpful. The visit 
should be full of meaning, of comment for improvement, or en- 
couragement for work well done, of kindly but candid criticism 
and suggestions how to do better. The superintendent should 
not be afraid to speak his disapproval, but should do it in a 
way that need not offend. He should not withhold his generous 
praise, for that lasts a long time in a teacher’s heart. He should 
be prepared with something new, pleasant, progressive, cheering, 
that the teacher and children will delight to see, to work with, 
to read, to hear about. In-other words his visit should mean 
something. It should be an event. Something to be talked 
about afterward, an event full of substance and without a shad- 
ow. This is the supervision that supervises. 
There are those that think that we can rush through a school 
in a few minutes, open the school door, say good morning, 
glance around and decide what is going on. It is probably true 
that we can detect whether things are right or wrong by the looks, 
but we are more than detectives, we want to know how right and 
how wrong, and what we can do to aid the good and save the
-P-A-G-E-19
THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A ScHOOL SUPERINTENDENT at 
poor. So the supervision that hurries always confuses, and the 
teacher does not regain her nerves in time to reallv be at work. 
If it should so happen that we have but one hour for a building, 
it is better to let some one teacher needing us have all that time. 
Then probably our visit will amount to something. 
The supreme test of a good superintendent is found in his 
work in the school room. To that extent he is a teacher, and a 
leader, and his work counts for help and inspiration and encour- 
agement. If his presence is a perpetual incentive to something 
letter, if he is cheerful and comforting to the discouraged, pa- 
tient with the earnestly struggling, ready and resourceful to 
those who could if they only knew how, if he comes in like sun- 
shine and makes things warm and bright and the school room is 
happier and better for his having been there, he may write him- 
self down as well on the way in his career of a superintendent.

THE SUPERINTENDENT’S RELATION TO 
THE COMMUNITY. 
It should always be held in mind that the school system 
belongs to the people. It is their money that supports it, and 
their children that attend it. They constitute the last court 
of appeals and they have the power and the right to abolish the 
whole thing if they want to. [A superintendent should beware 
lest he get the notion that the system belongs to him, and that 
he is responsible to nobody. Let him keep in mind that he 
has mainly duties while everybody else has rig! 
The Peopie’s Rights and Duties. The public is entitled to a 
full knowledge of what is going on. There is nothing in a 
school system that should be concealed from the people. 
Everything should be known and explained and proved. It 
is fair to say that a school system should be kept before the 
people’s notice, and made conspicuous. Not that the superin- 
tendent should praise himself ever, or court notoriety or seek 
te see his name in print, but rather for the purpose of inform- 
ing his people of what is going on in the schools. The public 
does nof object to spending money freely if they can see where 
it goes, and knows that it is expended wisely. It is always 
suspicious of affairs that are not properly aired. But a degree 
of prudence and discretion is needed, never to boast of what is 
not concerned in the greater problems. There is more than 
one superintendent who has brought contempt upon himself
-P-A-G-E-21
Tue SUPERINTENDENT's RELATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY 23 
and his schools by an incessant praise of his own virtues and 
the merits of his schools. The people are not readily fooled. 
What they want is information, not panegyric—the truth, and 
not boasting. 
So the public can be taken into one’s confidence regarding 
plans for the future. They want to know why more money 
is needed, why better teachers should be employed, why new 
iouses should be built. And knowing all these the school funds 
are more readily enlarged. Do not be afraid of the people. 
Individuals may rant, but the great silent mass will stand by 
the man who is right. 
The people should know the real intent and meaning of the 
modern school, and what is going on in other places, and what 
the masters think on great educational themes. Further 
than that, the home training and rearing of children, their 
habits, companionships, diet and health are all facts that the 
general publie is ignorant of and should be informed of. What 
training a child should have before he comes of school age, 
what should be expected of the home after he enters school, to 
what extent parents should help with the home studies, and 
co-operate with the teacher, and many other topies open the way 
for the superintendent to lead the thought of his people to- 
ward a high, noble and useful system of correlation of home 
and school. We may be sure that unless we relate and cor- 
relate the home and the school, until the child’s education is one 
and continuous, we are missing a great opportunity. 
The Daily Newspaper has always been open to the schools. 
There is not a paper in the land which will not be glad to print 
good articles on education, for it knows that every home con- 
tains a parent, and the child’s present and future welfare is 
the absorbing thought of the age. School articles should be
-P-A-G-E-22
24 - Lectures ox Scuoou Surerviston 
short, easily read and full of suggestion. The public will 
read a half column article, and generally that is enough. It is 
better to be frequent than lengthy. 
The Public Meeting on school questions is a good thing, for 
it serves to arouse interest in new subjects, but that is not so 
important as parents’ days in schools. On these days all the 
parents are invited to see the schools at their work, to meet 
the teacher, to hear the children recite, sing, declaim, and to in- 
“spect their written work. School entertainments occasionally 
are helpful, provided they are not elaborate. But all these 
things are insignificant in value compared to the mother class- 
es. Every teacher should have a meeting of all the mothers 
of the children in her school, say once a month. Here the real 
heart of the matter is reached. It is woman with woman, and 
heart talks to heart. I venture to say that any teacher who 
has never had mother’s meeting and who will have just one to 
try it, will find out things that will make her shed tears for 
shame at her ignorance. What to do at the mother classes? Tell 
them how you teach and what, how you want the children to 
behave and why, what they should do at home, ete., etc. 
you need not be afraid of the meeting being dull. Who has 
ever heard of a woman’s meeting where their children were 
the themes, that was dull? 
Right of Patronage. ‘The public has the right to patronize 
the schools so long as that right is not abused. We might 
safely say from a legal point of view, that each child has the 
right to a seat in the schools, and that the schools could never 
exclude any pupil on the ground of not having room. What- 
ever benefits are offered should be evenly distributed, though - 
it is‘not possible to make these benefits equally accessible. It 
is questionable if a community can be taxed to support a school _..
-P-A-G-E-23
Tue SUPERINTENDENT’s RELATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY - 25 
cr a school system, and only a limited number of pupils accom- 
modated. Jf a man pays his tax he should be allowed to send’ 
his child to school, somewhere or somehow. That is so long 
as this right of enrollment is not abused. 
It is abused by the patrons when they interfere with the 
teacher’s discipline, refusing to allow the children to conform 
to the school regulations. There are many instances on record 
of patrons, irate and storming, who have entered upon the 
school premises and, in the presence of the children have abused 
the teacher and the school to the point of extreme irritation. 
In such instances, the parent has forfeited his right of patron- 
age and may justly be asked to transfer his child to private 
tuition. 
The schools suffer greatly from parental prejudice and inter- 
ference. Not long ago in a County Institute a young teacher 
of a rural school who had listened patiently to the unfolding of 
modern methods of teaching, especially in reading, said, “It is 
useless for me to try that in my school. The people would not 
stand for it. They want me to teach the “good old way” and 
if I vary a hair breadth they will get another teacher.” The 
wise conductor said in reply: “Well, don’t you vary, yet 
awhile; wait until they like you well enough to let you have 
your way. In the meantime keep on learning.” 
While it is.true that the people as a whole have a right to 
say how much of a public school system they can afford to 
have, and what sort it shall be, yet when it comes to individuals 
in the community, they have no right of interference, diree- 
tion or dictation. 
Individual Rights. | However, each individual has a right to 
consideration and to justice. His complaints should be care- 
fully attended and investigated, and as much attention given
-P-A-G-E-24
26 Lectures oN ScHoon SUPERVISION 
to his individual trouble as if the matter was a public uprising 
or involved the whole mass of the people. A superintendent 
should not allow a single member of his community to have a 
grievance against the schools uninvestigated and unattended to. 
He should give himself freely and fully to satisfying every 
iaan, woman or child who lodges a complaint. I will go fur- 
ther and say that a superintendent should seek personal inter- 
views with anybody who he hears has said anything about the 
schools and explain away the misunderstanding. He should 
do this with a sure hold on his temper, and with a firm but per- 
suasive spirit see that the complaint is set right or, if he has 
just cause, that his complaint is investigated and the schools 
set right. Calmness and good temper are great helps when the 
patrons are mad, especially when the interview can be made 
face to face. Nine out of ten complaints arise from misun- 
derstandings or exaggerations. Face to face is the only way 
to settle the difficulty, and let all parties keep their temper. 
A case in point is as follows: A patron telephoned me 
once that a teacher had called his little girl “a low down little 
lussy,” and that in the presence of all the children. He was 
mad, his wife was crying, and he demanded that the teacher 
apologize promptly before the school or else the case would go 
before the board, etc. I answered, “Yes, that is very bad and, 
if true, the teacher shall make due amends. Meet me at the | 
school room tomorrow at nine o’clock. Bring the little girl and 
let her name all the children who heard what was said.” 
Promptly at nine o’clock I was on hand, and so was the man 
and his little girl. The investigation was conducted in the 
principal’s office privately. In answer to my first question 
the little girl said that the teacher had not used the words ~
-P-A-G-E-25
Tae SUPERINTENDENT’s RELATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY 27 
before her, but after she had gone. Some other girls had told 
her about it. 
{ called in the first witness, who said that another girl had 
told her. This other girl names still another who came in and 
said that she thought the teacher remarked “It was low down 
to act that way, and little girls should hurry on the way from 
school.” . 
When the teacher came in and was asked about it, she was 
surprised that any trouble was in the air, and remembered 
distinetly saying that “Mary was too nice a little girl to act ° 
that way, and it was wrong to bear tales on another, anyhow.” 
By this time the irate parent had cooled down considerably, 
aud ended by thanking the teacher for the ladylike way she 
handled some childish quarrel of the pupils on the way from 
school, and apologized for taking so much of our time about 
nothing. 
Thus will end most cases, when one side keeps good-natured 
and patient and brings the parties face to face. 
It is the Duty of the Public to Uphold the Teacher: In 
nearly every instance the teacher is right and the child is 
wrong. There is no easier way to break down a school or to 
weaken a teacher’s influence, than by having the parents crit- 
icise and abuse the teacher in the presence of the children. 
When the home and the school are antagonistic the child has a 
poor chance. He generally makes a poor pupil, and often a 
rebellious one. The influence of the tea-table and the fireside 
upon the discipline of a school room is more potent than teach- 
ers generally think. It is well worth a teacher’s while and 
time to visit the homes of the children, know their parents and 
secure their co-operation.
-P-A-G-E-26
28 LecTuREs on ScHoou SUPERVISION 
Politics. It is also the duty of the public to let the schools 
alone, especially in the matter of selecting teachers. The most 
baleful influence upon the school systems of the country is the 
political influence of powerful men who seck to make the 
schools the source of support for indigent gentlewomen. They 
may be needy, they may be worthy, but it is a crime to support 
them at the expense of the public and of the children, if they 
are not good teachers—and this latter the superintendent alone 
should say. How many weary battles have been fought for 
the schools, for the children and for the public itself, by the 
superintendents of the land, who have bared their breasts to 
the storm and said they would have none of it, that the schools 
were for teachers and not for kinfolk, or political allies and- 
friends! 
It is this kind of interference that is most far reaching in 
its effect, for when once started it gains in momentum, and 
once under full headway the school system is surely doomed to . 
worthlessness. There is no other good way, than for the super- 
intendent to say who shall and who shall not teach. 
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 
It is not within the province of these notes to discuss at 
length the methods of selecting a school board. So far as the werk 
of the superintendent is concerned, it matters but little whether 
his board is chosen by popular vote, by the city council, or 
appointed by the mayor. He is not responsible for this side 
of the work. It may matter much so far as the’ schools are 
concerned, though I do not know of any plan that entirely 
removes the selection of members of the board from politics. 
So long as men are ambitious for office any public institution
-P-A-G-E-27
Tue SuPERINTENDENT's RELATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY 29 
will be subjected to unworthy influence. This is to be expected, 
and it is to be deplored and combated. 
The schools belong to the people, and they must directly or 
indirectly select their representatives on the school board. The 
only safe plan is that which contains some check to interference, 
and makes it impossible for unworthy men to place unworthy 
teachers in the schools. If there is a safeguard in the law, or 
in the rules of the board, it makes but little difference how the 
board is chosen. 
The school board has its duties to perform that should be 
well defined and not encroached upon by the superintendent. 
These duties relate to the outside management of the schools, 
especially all matters of finances. It is for them to decide so 
far as they have the power, the amount of money to be expended 
upon the school system and to apportion this amount in such 
way as they may decide. . They may ask advice of the superin- 
tendent, and should do so, but after all the power is with them, 
and it should be respected by the superintendent. 
The Control of Finances extends to the fixing of the salaries 
of the superintendent and the teachers. The amount to be 
spent in supplies and apparatus, the cost of school sites and 
houses, and the proper auditing and payment of all bills and 
the inspection of the books of the treasurer. This is a very im- 
portant function and should be carefilly guarded by the board, 
to avoid waste or extravagance and a deficit at the end of the 
year. Having apportioned the amount, great or small, the. 
superintendent should set himself to aid the board in the wise 
and economical expenditure of the school funds. 
The board should have the power to elect the superintend- 
ent, and to define his duties. It will depend very largely upon 
the size of the school system as to what these duties will consist
-P-A-G-E-28
80 LECTURES ON ScHOUL SUPERVISION 
of. He may be able to supervise all the teachers himself, or 
may need to have it done through assistants. In which case 
he should be empowered to nominate his assistants. He may 
or may not be the secretary, and even the treasurer of the 
board. This depends upon the size of the school system, its 
peculiar needs, and is not essential to this discussion. The main 
point is that the superintendent is chosen by the board, and is 
its chief executive officer. 
The Board also Elects the Teachers. These should be selected 
by the superintendent as we have before seen, but power rests - 
with the board to say who the individuals shall be. 
Lastly the board is a court of appeals, to whom matters may 
be finally carried and by whom all disputes may be adjusted. 
it is easily seen that differences will arise between ihe super- 
intendent and the teachers, and between him and the public, 
and that the strong arm of the last authority is needed to 
enforce what is right. 
We should not forget to mention that it is the duty of the 
school board to be personally informed as to what is going on 
in the schools, they should visit the rooms, and see for them- 
selves what conditions prevail. The superintendent should 
insist upon this in order that his recommendations may be more 
readily appreciated and more cheerfully adopted. These visits 
need not be heralded beforehand, but quietly and unannounced 
the members should drop in and make up their estimates of 
the quality of the work. 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE BOARD. 
The superintendent should never undertake to select the 
membership of the Board. When it comes to who shall and 
who shall not be members, he should say, “It is none of my
-P-A-G-E-29
THE SUPERINTENDENT’s RELATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY 31 
affair.” As soon as it is suspected that he seeks to control the. 
nominations to membership, he arouses an antagonism among 
the people, and in case his candidates are defeated, his oppo 
nents will hardly be in accord and sympathy with his plans for 
the school. The safest plan in the long run is to let the elections 
or nominations severely alone, and avoid giving advice as far 
as possible. He should be so strong and so secure in his own 
division of the labors, that he does not fear the advent of any 
one on. the board. 
The superintendent should never assume any authority not 
granted by the board. He should not trespass on their rights 
or prerogatives. Whatever matters are in their province he 
snould respect and steadily refer to them. It is the only way 
to have the board respect the rights that belong to him. What- 
ever limitations are set by the board should not be exceeded by 
him. For instance, if the board reserved the right to make all 
contracts for school supplies, and even to order all school ma- 
terial, the superintendent has no right to go beyond that and ‘ 
make contracts or give out orders, expecting his board to stand 
by him. No matter how much power or influence he may have 
with his board it is a question of right, and of prudence, of cour- 
tesy and of safety for him never to go beyond the delegated 
powers. Whatever he does should be defensible, on the ground 
that he had the right and the power to do it, and that he did 
what was wise and proper. 
No superintendent can afford to ignore his board, for men 
do not like to be ignored, or overshadowed. Whatever credit 
or improvement belongs to them should be accorded to them. 
Whatever praise is due them for their efficiency should be 
allowed them. The superintendent who tries to be the whole 
thing, and makes out his board to be nothing, who rushes
-P-A-G-E-30
32 LECTURES ON ScHOOL SUPERVISION 
into print to say what he has done, and keeps a wood cut of 
himself on hand to insert in the paper every time the board 
has a meeting, will find out very soon that the board tires of 
so much greatness, and that they do not care to monopolize so 
much magnificence. It is best to be modest, let others praise 
you and to see that the board is given its share of the honors. 
The superintendent who absorbs all the credit some day may 
have to shoulder all the blame. Best not be greedy. 
On the other hand, all troubles should be settled outside the 
board if possible. The members are generally busy men, who 
do not care to be burdened with much detail of school work, 
and who feel embarrassed to be compelled to decide disputes or 
trivial matters. There are times when they must be called in, 
but let these times be as seldom as possible, for their sake. A 
superintendent shows his strength by the skill with which he 
manages his work, by the little friction he creates, by the little 
noise he makes. There are hundreds of small differences that 
constantly arise, that could be fanned into great flames of wrath 
and dispute, if not wisely handled, and the board would be in 
continuous session settling troubles, if the superintendent chose 
to keep them busy. If he is prudent, he keeps trouble away 
from his board, and shows his value by relieving them of all 
disagreeable details, and never going to them or allowing a case 
to get to them unless he has exhausted all his resources and 
needs their support to uphold his authority. The best machin- 
ery is that which works with least friction or noise and which 
needs the least repairs. 
A Good Superintendent is Loyal to His Board. He feels 
kindly to each member, and is perfectly frank. He will not 
stoop to flatter and still less to boasting or deceit. He will not 
merit their contempt by that species of sycophancy that
-P-A-G-E-31
Taz SUPERINTENDENT's RELATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY 33 
expends itself in nervous and effusive attention. He still meets 
them as man to man, and preserves his dignity and originality 
and independence, thereby preserving their regard and respect. 
He is loyal to their interests and can be depended on to defend 
their actions. 
He Never Talks Outside. Whatever he has to say by way of 
criticism he says it to the board itself, or to the teachers 
themselves. He does not indulge in street corner gossip about 
variances in the school affairs. If he has anything to say’ he 
defends the policy announced, or at least. keeps silent if he can- 
not approve. Least of all will he comment upon the personal 
shortcomings of those with whom he works, whether they be 
his superior or inferior officers. He not only abstains from 
gossip but frowns upon it in others, remembering that it is 
species of treason, and that disagreeable comment from high 
authority travels fast and generally direct to the persons com- 
mented upon. 
The superintendent should be brave enough to speak his own 
mind to the board on school matters, fearlessly and without 
heat and passion, but having done so let him remember that 
their decision is final, and having spoken let him be still. Noth- 
ing so irritates a board as a nagging superintendent, who is 
never content with the dictum of those who have a right to 
give him orders. In accepting their judgment on affairs 
within their province, it should be done cheerful: 
and finally. 
This makes the superintendent reliable. The

Lecture III 
THE SELECTION AND TRAINING OF 
TEACHERS 
In the selection, training and management of the teachers the 
superintendent will have an opportunity of showing his great- 
est skill. A school system depends on its teachers. A fine corps 
cf teachers can make a good system even if the superintendent 
is ordinary, but the best superintendent is doomed to failure 
if his grade work is hopeless. Therefore, the real crisis is 
when a teacher is to be chosen, remembering that it is always 
easier to keep a poor teacher out than it is to put him out. 
The general ery everywhere is that the schools are used for 
political purposes, and inefficient and untrained persons are put 
in charge of the buildings and grades, at the instance of board 
members who wish to please their political allies and support- 
ers, or who are led away in sympathy for the needs of indigent 
women. 
Such a condition will ruin any school system. So long as 
teachers are employed upon any other basis than that of school- 
room ability, the system is doomed to inefficiency. Everybody 
will recognize the truth of the statement, in his calmer mo- 
ments, that school-teachers should not be selected upon a 
basis of sympathy or political reward. Even the board mem- 
bers recagnize that. Therefore, when there is no election 
pending, when the waters are calm and no instance is up, and 
nobody to be made an example of, then is the time to get the
-P-A-G-E-34
36 Lectures oN Schoo, SuPERVISsION 
board to bind itself by formal resolution to do the right thing 
when the next time comes. Then when the crisis arises and a 
few wish to override the schools, there is a rule against it which 
the superintendent and the board may fall back upon to pro- 
tect the schools. 
HOW TEACHERS ARE SELECTED. 
As a general thing the majority of teachers in a large school 
system come from the local supply. This is all right, and I 
am willing to say that so long as good teachers can be had 
from the city or county in which the schools are located this 
home talent should be considered. But home talent is to be 
taken only so long as it is talent, and when it is no longer so, 
it is not too far to go to the ends of the earth to get a good 
teacher. 
While this is true of home talent, it may also be said that 
every system needs the infusion of new blood at times, and 
that the importation of outside talent brings new ideas and 
methods and introduces a freshness that could not otherwise 
be had. A system can return into itself by too constantly em- 
ploying its own product, until it becomes set: and formal. 
The superintendent should have the power to prepare an 
eligible list of candidates from which the board agrees to elect 
the teachers. This power being granted, the superintendent 
should make it his most earnest duty to find good teachers by 
all means in his power. The supply of teachers will come 
from three sources. 
1. Those local high school graduates who will go to repu- 
table Normal Schools and spend their time and money in pre 
paring themselves for teaching. 
2. Those local high school graduates who are not able to go
-P-A-G-E-35
Tai SELECTION AND TRaINInG oF TEACHERS 387 
off to Normal Schools, but who want to teach, and who will 
spend time in a sufficient training in the local training school. 
8. Those who are non-residents, who have taught with 
success elsewhere, and who by virtue of special merit and 
special reasons are desirable acquisitions to your own school 
systems. 
Let us consider some of the qualifications that a superintend- 
ext seeks, aside from technical training. 
1. Every Teacher Must Have a Good Education. Without 
this as a basis nothing can be done. The broader and deeper 
the education the greater the culture. All learning is of value 
in the school room. The superintendent should satisfy himself 
that all applicants have a good foundation of scholarship before 
starting upon their professional training. Every teacher in the 
grammar grades should have at least a high school education, 
and every high school teacher should have a college education. 
We may say in general terms that a teacher’s education should 
be at least four years beyond the work he is called upon to do. 
2. Every teacher should have an abounding good health, 
and should take care of it. Our success is dependent on our 
health, and the school-room demands the best that is in us. 
Sickness begets irritability, crossness, peevishness and impa- 
tience. It is hardly too much for a superintendent to demand 
a physician’s certificate of health of every applicant for posi- 
tions in his schools. 
It is palpable viclation of common sense for a teacher, who 
has consumption, or indeed any contagious or infectious disease, 
or coming from a family where acute contagious diseases pre- 
vail, to be allowed in the school room. Consumptives often seek 
school work, thinking the labor is light and the exposure not 
dangerous. A superintendent should be on his guard and while
-P-A-G-E-36
38 Lectures on Scuoon SurERVIsSION 
the issue is hard, he should be firm and just. In fact every 
teacher and every school house, should be under the regulations 
of the board of health of the city, and only the soundest condi- 
ticns should be allowed. More than once I have received ap- 
pealing letters from teachers in higher and colder latitudes, ask- 
ing for positions in the schools of the South, saying they were 
delicate and needed the warm air of the southern climate to 
restora them to health and vigor. My answer has always been 
that school rooms needed teachers of perfect health and vigor 
and that delicate people needed out-door exercise and work in 
cur balmy southern latitudes. 
I will not go to the length of saying that all teachers should 
be good looking or that they should be graded in appearance, 
but I feel sure in saying that children love beautiful things 
and beautiful people, and that it does seem as if we at times 
take advantage of the innocents by compelling them to gaze 
upon some forbidding countenances. I use the word forbidding 
advisedly, for I am ready to confess that some of the most at- 
tractive faces have the least pretensions to beauty. They have 
what is far better than beauty—they have spirit. 
3. This last remark leads up to the statement that disposi- 
tion counts for nearly everything in a teacher. The teacher’s 
attitude toward the childrén and her work generally, will de- 
termine whether she is made of the right sort or not. No one 
ean define the teacher’s spirit, nor expound it in set formulas. 
It is with some people, and not with others. It is also as ummis- 
takable as it is indefinable. It is in the manners, the voice, the 
eyé, the face, but no one can say what or tell how it can be ac- 
quired. It is truly born, not made. 
4, A Teacher had Best Begin Young. Youth is the period of 
enthusiasm, vivacity and cheerfulness. It is the time when we
-P-A-G-E-37
Tue SELECTION AND TRAINING oF TEACHERS 89 
acquire our habits and our style, and get our dispositions set. 
It is the plastic period. I have rarely seen anybody turn to 
teaching after thirty-five or forty years of age that made even 
a measurable success in it. 
HOW TEACHERS ARE TRAINED. 
Every applicant should go through a training before begin- 
ning to teach. In these days of Normal Schools in every state, 
when tuition is free and boarding is nominal, there are not 
many who ean truly say they cannot afford to get ready to 
teach. However, granting that a superintendent feels the need 
of training and testing the material that comes to him, it will 
not be amiss to deseribe the plan I have pursued in my own 
schools in Augusta. 
Local Training School. I selected the three best teachers in 
the schools, one for the first grade, one for the second grade, 
and one for the third grade, and established them as training 
schools in one of the school buildings convenient to ‘my office. 
These three teachers had regular grade work to do, with the 
usual enrollment of pupils and the regular course of study to 
follow. I expended much time in detailing the method of those 
teachers and had them approximate the standard of excellence 
desired for all teachers. 
To begin with I reduced the room to approximately ideal 
conditions of physical equipment. The walls, the blackboard, 
the light, the heat, the pictures, the desks, the cabinets, the 
window boxes, the vases, the teacher’s desk, the children’s sup- 
plies, the apparatus—indeed everything that a school room 
ought to have—I put into these three rooms, and I called them 
the standard toward which, the system as a whole should strive 
and gradually reach. I at least had three good rooms to show
-P-A-G-E-38
40 ' Lectures on Scroon SuPERVISION 
as a sample of what all other rooms should be. In these rooms 
T put the three best teachers I had and paid them a little more 
than usual for the work they had before them. They represented 
scholarship and leadership, and experience, and were not afraid. 
To these teachers I then assigned the applicants for positions, 
those who desired to become teachers in the schools. They 
were the apprentice teachers under skilled workmen and were 
required to work in those grades at least a year before they 
would be considered available for regular work. In this way 
each apprentice has one or two months study and daily instruc- 
tion in each of three grades during the year. By this time it 
is not difficult to decide who has most skill for the school room, 
and who has least. 
These schools are not observation schools. ‘The student 
teachers go daily, two or three at a time, remove their hats and 
wraps, and are assigned to such help as they can do. As they 
individually become more skilled they assume more work until 
the regular teacher withdraws and leaves them in complete 
charge. When this is satisfactory the course is complete. We 
know then whom we want as teachers, when there are vacancies 
to be filled. 
In addition to training the applicants, the training school 
teachers supervise the work of the regular teachers. The teach- 
ers in training are sent out to do practice work in the schools 
and the regular teachers being relieved thereby spend a week or 
more in the school, comparing and correcting their own work. 
By this means the superintendent can test the value of new 
methods in his training school, and promulgate it to all other 
teachers without difficulty. It has aided the superintendent in 
the work of supervising the lower grades and has simplified the 
introduction of methods and has given a proper avenue for all 
applicants to enter the system as regular teachers.
-P-A-G-E-39
Tue SELECTION aND TRAINING OF TEACHERS 41. 
The value of the training school in protecting the system 
against polities or sympathy is considerable. Suppose a man 
comes to you or goes to any of the board and says, “I should 
like my daughter to get a position as teacher.” Your answer is, 
“Why certainly, sir, we will be delighted to have her enter our 
training school in order to prepare her for future work.” Well, 
she enters the training school, and possibly she may become a 
fine teacher, or at least you have the chance to quietly prove to 
her satisfaction that she is not suited to the school room, or 
that others have made better records. Sometimes it is not a 
bad idea to tire the applicants out rather than provoke a con- | 
vulsion in the community. In this way the training school op- 
poses a front to imposition in the school. 
This plan is equally applicable to rural schools, by a simple 
modification. If a superintendent will select one of his rural 
schools, nearby—easy of supervision, and expend his energies 
upon making it a model for all his schools, he can then use it 
asatype. It will make the best institute for a week’s instruc- 
tion he could have. 
Course of Reading. Along this training in practice work 
should go a course in reading. This course in reading has been 
divided into four heads :* 
1. Psychology, or a basis of principles. 
2. Methodology, or a basis for instruction. 
3. Economy, or a basis for management. 
4. History of, education, for breadth of view. Oy 
I cannot undertake to name the books that a teacher should 
read and study under each department. There are m 
good, excellent hooks under each head, and the superintendent's

library will be filled with samples of each sort. I will say that 
each teacher should own his books, should buy them as the be- 
ginning of his pedagogical library, should mark them as he 
chooses and annotate them all he can, and re-read them as often 
as necessary. I believe I could name a dozen books that would 
inake a satisfactory working library for any teacher. 
A Liberal Policy. I wish to suggest to you a liberal policy 
toward your teachers in the matter of training. Many of 
them are too poor to go off to school unaided, and they need their 
monthly wages to live on, and possibly to support others depend- 
ent on them. If they could afford it in any way they would 
gladly go off for training. I suggest that you get your board to 
pass a resolution exeusing any teacher for a year on full pay, 
less a small amount to pay a substitute in her grade, provided she 
takes what is left and goes off to school. If a teacher is getting 
$500 a year, she could take $15 a month for nine months or 
$135 and with it employ some one out of the training school to 
teacher her grade. With the remainder, $365, and a loan outside 
if necessary, she can spend a year in a good normal school 
and come hack equipped for better work. Thei teacher gains by 
it, and the board loses no money by it. I have tried this 
and I know its value, in enthusing and stimulating the 
teachers. 
Teacher’s Meetings. After all is done and said there remains 
yet the fact that a superintendent needs to come face: to face 
with his teachers at regular times, as well as have them come to- 
gether for conference with each other. In ordinary conditions, I 
should advise the monthly assembly of all teachers in a school 
system for general lectures and discussions. In these meetings, 
topics of general and universal interest should be discussed. The 
superintendent may lecture, he may conduct an experience
-P-A-G-E-41
Tur SELECTION AND TRAINING OF TEACHERS 43 
meeting, he may have a program of several subjects, or he may 
have some speaker invited to address the teachers. At any rate 
the meeting should be a live one, and the teachers should feel - 
an interest in assembling. 
Then there are grade meetings, reading clubs, manual art 
classes, and other devices and methods for getting the teachers 
te assemble and help each other in their work. 
By all means the superintendent should insist upon the 
teachers meeting by grades, to discuss the subjects peculiar to 
their work. Tf possible he should meet with them, and find out 
what they think and what they need. Each grade could thus 
pursue a line of study and investigation most helpful to the 
teacher bearing directly upon the grade needs. 
Individually each teacher should subscribe to a teacher’s 
paper, or journal, or magazine, according to the grade of work. 
Some money must be invested in the business, and the money 
that counts the most is that spent for books and periodicals. A 
teacher’s club is possible, in which several join to make a sum 
of money to be invested in a number of journals for cireulation 
among the members. A good superintendent will see that every 
teacher is a subscriber to a school paper and he will be ready 
with good advice on this subject. 
Likewise will every superintendent’s office be provided with 
professional books for circulation among the teachers. It is 
worth while for a board of education to invest some money in 
a school library for the use of its workers, and the superintend- 
ent should see that it is used. If every teacher is not calling 
for books, select one and send it with the kind advice to read 
it. This may start some individuals to reading. 
All these means and many others emphasize the need of

THE PROPER TREATMENT OF 
TEACHERS 
Th seems to me if I were a teacher in a public school system 
I would rather feel settled than unsettled, satisfied that I would 
be undisturbed except for cause; that I had a chance to inerease 
my pay if I deserved it; that my superintendent was going to 
help me instead of finding fault with me, and that when T grew 
too old to serve, that the board was going to provide for me 
in some way. I should then feel comfortable and do my utmost. 
to please. On the other hand, if I was eternally afraid of my 
position being filled by somebody else, of having my pay cut 
down, my work abused, myself talked about, I should be so 
nervous and fearsome that my heart would not be centered on _ 
what I was doing. I would be so busy holding on to my job: 
that I could not do any teaching. 
Security, Prospects, Encouragement, Provision for Illness and 
Age are what every teacher wants. Then she can work; for 
she is not distracted by worry. The superintendent has a good 
deal to do with all this, for he is the man to be pleased or dis- 
pleased, to encourage or discourage, to help or hinder, to soothe 
or distract. Every teacher feels that her hopes are in the hands 
of her superintendent and as he thinks so will she be. They 
think right, for the superintendent is in charge of the. teachers. 
and he is the man to decide what they must do, bow they
-P-A-G-E-44
46 LEcTuREs ON ScHoOL SUPERVISION 
should do it, and whether they shall be the ones to do it. There- 
fore, the superintendent needs to know what is going on. 
Teachers—Their Treatment. The superintendent needs to 
know what the teachers are doing in the school room, and there 
is but one way and that is to go and see. His visit may have 
a two-fold purpose, one to find out what is going on, and the 
cther to help. A superintendent may quietly enter a school 
room and sit unobserved and inobtrusive through many exer- 
cises, in order that he may ascertain the general character of 
the work done by the teacher. Having done this he should 
then privately make such comments as he feels proper, either 
of commendation, suggestion or criticism. If his visit brings 
hima feeling of dissatisfaction the teacher should know it, and 
he should define in what particulars he is dissatisfied. 
Physical;Condition of the School Room. Among the things 
to be noted by a superintendent, are first the physical condition 
of the school room—if it is too hot or too cold, if the air is 
vitiated, or the light is too dim or too strong. Te should note 
the neatness of the room, if the floor is littered, the desks untidy 
the shades awry, or if order and neatness prevail. He should 
observe the decorations of the room. The condition of walls 
and blackboards, flowers and other things that give a pleasing 
or a disagreeable effect. 
It is advisable to persist in the determination to have 
the school rooms kept in order, clean, decorated, well aired and 
lighted, some flowers, some good pictures, clean window glass, 
ete. It has been observed many times that an orderly, well 
cared for exterior indicates excellence in the interior, and that 
a school room that looks well, is generally taught well. Some- 
how there is born in us a great respect for decent things and we 
do better when we are surrounded by respectable and uplifting
-P-A-G-E-45
THe Proper TREATMENT oF TEACHERS ay 
influences. A good teacher is known by the school room she 
keeps. A crown does not make a king, but it indicates one, 
Attire does not make a man, but it generally marks him. So 
a well-kept, well-decorated, clean and wholesome school room 
may not make a good teacher, but it generally indicates one. 
Other Things He should observe the methods of instruction; 
if they tend to order or disorder, if interesting or dull, if cm- 
phasis is placed on bright pupils only, if the class is alert and 
eager or dull and listless. Having observed these, he should 
consider the causes of failure, if such be the case, and suggest 
remedies at the proper time. 
He should mark the progress of the pupils, and discover 
if they have kept vu» with whatever standard he has set, and 
notify the teacher whether the class is going too fast or too 
slow. 
He should pay attention to whatever individual instances 
are worthy of attention, Some pupils who could be advanced 
may be held back on account of others. Some may be struggling 
to keep up with a class too advanced for them. These should 
be regraded. 
This kind of critical supervision should be discussed with 
the teacher in charge and practical suggestions made that will 
really help. If a superintendent merely goes in and sits down, 
and passes an hour or more listening and goes away without a 
word, his visit has been a waste of time for himself and for 
the school. He has not supervised. He has merely visited. 
Also, a superintendent may enter right. into the spirit of the 
grade, and make his presence a real inspiration to the teacher. 
He could come in like sunshine or a breeze, and have a bright 
way of hearing a recitation, or a book to give the grade, or 
some exercise for the pupils to work, or something to show or
-P-A-G-E-46
48 Lectures on ScHoon SuPERVISION 
tell them. His visit will then be an event to be remembered. 
By all means, let the time spent be worth while. Let the super- 
vision be real and substantial, and if there are errors to be 
corrected, let them be noticed and corrected. 
This takes time. No grade can be understood that is 
casually visited for a few minutes every now and then. A 
superintendent needs to spend the entire day with a teacher if 
he will understand the work. Tis visit should be repeated at 
least once every two months. An easy calculation will show 
how many teachers one man ean thus safely supervise. 
A superintendent should remember that the teachers are not 
his subordinates, but his fellow workers. It is true they follow 
his leadership, but they should always be treated with the 
courtesy, kindness and consideration that is due the gentle 
women who always occupy the place of grade teachers. A su- 
perintendent commits an unpardonable error when he is rude 
or neglectful or impolite, or takes advantage of his position, 
or presumes upon his office. 
“ He Should Have no Favorites Among the Teachers. ‘That is, 
no personal favorites. He may justly say that certain teachers 
are excellent in their work, but his commendations and ex- 
pressions should be limited to their professional values. It is 
ruinous for a superintendent to distribute favors among his 
teachers according to his own likes or dislikes. It lowers his 
level. It begets jealousies, enmities, rivalries and brings criti- 
cisms and comments that affect his own dignity, and disturb 
the true relation of the teachers with each other. Therefore, 
no comparisons, one teacher with another. 
Be careful what you say of the teachers, and to the teachers ; 
for you may be sure that your comments will go with exaggera 
tion to the parties under discussion.
-P-A-G-E-47
Tue PRopEeR TREATMENT OF TEACHERS : 49 
A superintendent stands in great danger of doing too much 
talking. He is led on to say things of the teachers, of the 
schools and of the board, that are indiscreet and often unjust. 
More superintendents have hurt their work by too much talking 
than by too little. A good superintendent first learns when 
not to talk, He then learns when to talk. 
Likewise no Compliments. It is below the dignity of a su- 
perintendent to excite the vanity of teachers by undue praise 
vf their labors, and the jealousies of those who are not com- 
mended. Jf words of commendation are due, they can be 
delivered in dignified and worthy ways, generally in person 
and alone, but flippant flattery is belittling. Likewise no 
familiarity. A superintendent cannot afford to be familiar 
with his teachers. He should hold himself in a cordial but 
rather formal relation with them, that they may always look 
up to him with respect and regard. 
I think there are teachers who would like the superintendent 
to be attentive to them, to visit them, or show them courtesies 
outside of the routine of his business. This the superintendent 
cannot afford to do. He must seek his intimates outside his 
corps of teachers. for he cannot well control his force if he 
admits them to the level of his daily confidences. 
Proper Emphasis. One of the dangers that a superintendent 
is liable to, is his tendency to pay too much attention to the 
good teaching and te neglect the apparently hopeless. As a 
matter of fact, the emphasis of a superintendent’s work should 
be placed on his poor teachers. If there is a poor, struggling 
and unsuecessful teacher anywhere who wants to succeed and 
does not, there is the place for the superintendent to spend his 
time and to show what he can do to help, The good teachers 
can take care of themselves, but the poor teachers need help.
-P-A-G-E-48
50 Lecturzs oN Scnoo. SUPERVISION 
It is hard for a superintendent to avoid turning into grades 
where he will feel proud and satisfied with the character of the 
work, but if he does this constantly his system will separate 
into two classes, and the good teachers will get better and the 
poor teachers will remain as they are. 
To a Limited Degree a Superintendent is Responsible for the 
Failure of any Teacher of his System. He cannot. console him- 
self by saying that the ability was not there, for often he has 
not paid enough attention to the case in hand to find out. No 
teacher should be given up as hopeless until the superintendent 
can conscientiously declare that he knows the conditions that 
prevail, and has done his best to reform them. One may 
almost go to the extent of saying that a superintendent who 
puts all his life into saving the apparently impossible teacher, 
will find that nine out of ten will respond enough to satisfy 
his demands. The superintendent should look upon his 
teachers, as he would have the teachers look upon their pupils. 
He should no more favor the bright teachers and disregard 
and seek to be rid of the dull ones, than. a teacher should favor 
the bright pupils and be glad to be free of tne dull ones. 
A superintendent should also be careful not to interfere with 
or discourage the independence of the teachers. There is a 
possibility of carrying uniformity of methed too far. It is 
sufficient for the teachers individually to adbere to the general 
principles of instruction as given them by the superintendent, 
and exemplified in the training of the schools, but each teacher 
should be left free to pursue his own plan of application. Nor 
should he resent any candor or criticism on the part of the 
teachers toward his particular outline of procedure. If a 
teacher differs from him, the discussion of that difference may 
bring more light upon the subject. At any rate, there should he
-P-A-G-E-49
Tue Proper TREATMENT oF TEACHERS SL 
perfect treedom of opinion, although it must in the end be 
subordinate to the orders that are issued. 
If a school system is organized upon the military basis in 
which the board of education hands down its orders to the 
superintendent, he hands down his to the principals, and they 
tc the teachers, there can be no confusion. Until orders are 
issned there can be great liberty of discussion and opinion, but 
atter the orders have been made all discussion is at.an end, and 
everybody should fall in line and give cheerful and prompt 
and co-operative obedience. This definition of authority, and 
a strict adherence to rights and duties and spheres of authority, 
is the only way to prevent confusion and to forestall insubor- 
dination. 
The happiest condition prevails when the teachers recognize 
in the superintendent their best friend and support. When 
iney feel they can rely on him to deal fairly by each one, to see 
that justice is secured, and proper attention is paid, then a 
spirit of confidence is created among them that makes collision 
and misunderstanding well nigh impossible. The teachers 
should know that the superintendent is on their side. He can 
be depended wpon to stand by them4n a crisis, and defend them 
against the public or the board, or anybody who assails them 
unjustly. While he is candid to them as to their faults and 
striet in his requirements of them, yet he is never unfair, or 
harsh, or rude, or unkind and never abuses them to others. His 
best things are said of them, his severest things are said to 
them. The greatest compliment to be paid a superintendent 
is for his teachers to say: ‘He is our friend, and we can de- 
pend on him.” For such a one, every woman. who teaches under 
him will work her very best with gladness, and every man will 
spend his life in the fulness of sacrifice and service.
-P-A-G-E-50
52 Lectures on ScHooL SUPERVISION 
Payment of Teachers. There are various opinions of how 
teachers should be paid for their work. We may summarize 
them as follows: 
1. According to grade of room. 
2. According to length of service. 
3. According to value of work. 
There is only one broad proposition that covers the ground, 
and that is that teachers should be paid according to what they 
are worth. Even a good teacher is not worth as much the first 
year of teaching as the second or third, and a poor teacher is 
not worth any more, no matter how long the experience. So 
that in the very beginning even good teachers should not be 
paid as much as those who have added to their ability by study 
and experience. It is, therefore, best to start all new teachers 
at a minimum rate and to increase their pay as. they improve. 
It will not do to increase their pay according to the length of 
service, for some teachers show no improvement year after 
year, and a superintendent is inclined to deal leniently with 
their shortcomings and give them another chance. 
Since teachers must. be put to work in city schools in some 
grades, it is best to start them in one of the middle grades and 
promote them up or down according to special talent for lower 
grade or upper grade work. Also as they develop ability in the 
school room, their compensation should increase until the 
maximum rate is reached regardless of whether they are pro- 
moted or not. This fact of improvement the superintendent 
must decide, and he must decide it conscientiously and after 
full investigation. If a teacher has been studious and has 
shown an increasing power in the school room then more pay 
should be allowed, if not, then not. I do not know of any other
-P-A-G-E-51
Tue Proper Treatment or TEACHERS 53 
way to settle the question, though I admit that few schools base 
their salaries upon such a schedule. 
What Shall be Done With the Incompetents? As I have above 
remarked, a superintendent should hold himself partly account- 
able for failure of any of the teachers of his system. It is his 
business to concern himself deeply with the weak places in his 
school, to advise, demonstrate, stimulate, explain, provide and 
help daily, if need be, until the last effort has been used. Then 
if failure be the result he cannot be held to account. As a mat- 
ter of fact, a good superintendent will have but few failures in 
his schools, for he will move against such a predicament by em- 
ploying only good material and taking care of it, once it is 
under his charge. But there are incompetents and these should 
give way. It is not right to endanger the education of children 
by the retention in the system of those who cannot or will not. 
It is hard to do, and apparently cruel to do, but it is advisable. 
- The few must suffer for the good of the many. 
The Aged Should be Retired, with the thanks of the public for 
service long rendered, and their expenses should be borne by 
the board as pensioners upon the system, at a small sum per 
month, so long as they live. It is but right, and the cost is 
small, and it does not often occur. 
All those means J have advocated tend to the strength of a 
school system, by Jetiing teachers know that once in, they will 
be safe so long as they ax good work. They will be paid more 
as they are worth more. They will be made good teachers by 
every means possible, and p.ovided for in their old age. This 
gives stability and center to a school system, relieves the mind 
and tension of the teachers, so tat all their energies are upon 
their labors, and so dignifies the calling that the best talent

THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE 
COURSE OF STUDY 
It devolves upon the superintendent to arrange the Course of 
Study for the guidance of the teachers and the instruction of 
the children. Upon the choice of good, interesting, teachable 
text-books as a basis, and their best, wisest and just disposition 
in the grades, will depend in great measure the ease of teaching 
and the suecess of the instruction. The Course of Study should 
be constantly in your mind. It will need readjustment every 
year in some detail, though it need not be. overhauled too 
frequently. . 
A child is sent to school to get his education. Here he gets 
culy a part of it, for everything educates him, his companions, 
his books, and whatever he sees or touches—what he gets out 
of the books is only a part of the great scheme of training that 
results in his establishment as a man, adjusted to his environ- 
ment, and capable of reacting upon the influences of nature 
and of people. Let us see for a moment what a boy will meet . 
when he gets into the world, and what forces will impel and 
compel him. 
Society. He finds himself among people, in an organized 
society, with a code of ethics not all written in the statute 
books, but as fixed and definite as any laws. He must know 
then his relations to his fellow men, how to behave in company, 
how to be polite and respect the rights and feelings of others,
-P-A-G-E-54
56 Lectures on ScHoon SuPERVISION 
liow to enlist the interest of men in his affairs, and how to lend 
his own interest to their affairs. So the study of Ethics as 
based upon the Bible and the experience of mankind, that keeps 
men from stealing, from lying, from. murder, from excess of all 
sorts, and that leads up to self-restraint and the establishment 
of good principles is of the first and greatest moment. 
Business. In this society he encounters the problem of self- 
support. He must make his bread by dealing with the people 
who have things he wants and who will exchange them for 
things he has. If he has more to exchange than he actually 
needs, he accumulates a surplus and becomes rich. If he has 
less to exchange than he needs, he keeps poor. Tf he has noth- 
ing to exchange he becomes a pauper. The great medium of 
exchange is language—men need to talk, to write, to spell, to 
read, and this with ease and accuracy—otherwise their inter- 
course will be labored and unsatisfactory. 
Then men need to calculate. Their transactions arc based 
on figures, and bookkeeping. All the commerce of the world, 
all the manufacturing of the world, all the system of change 
and exchange can be recorded only by figures. So the mathe- 
matical sciences help men to earn a livelihood. Likewise the 
manual arts, and the industrial occupations, and all the me- 
chanical and technical handicraft eccupations are based upon 
the sciences and mathematics, in which men engage in order to 
be producers of things that other people want. In other words, 
he finds himself surrounded not only by a society of people, 
but also a society of busy people, struggling each to support 
himself and to wring a livelihood out of the world of business. 
Self. In order to do all this a man must take care of his 
health and strength. The first duty he owes to himself is a
-P-A-G-E-55
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE CouRsE oF SrupY 57 
knowledge of the laws of his own body, whereby he can work 
it to the greatest advantage with the least pain and greatest 
efficiency and for the longest time. How to prolong life, and 
make it comfortable is essential knowledge. This brings up 
ihe question of what and how a man eats, what and how he 
sleeps, and what comforts he has at home; what recreations, 
what pleasures, what rest, what consideration he gives to the 
spiritual and poetical and cultural sides of his life. In other 
words, how does he care for himself, what sort of a home life 
has he, and what does he do to oceupy the hours of his leisure? 
Therefore, physiology, hygiene, music, art, poetry, fiction, the 
domestic sciences of cocking, sewing, cleaning, sanitation, child 
rearing, are all concerned with’ what a man owes to himself 
and those dependent upon him, and somewhat answers the 
question of how will a man spend his livelihood after he has 
made it. 
The State. It is every man’s duty and right to be a patriot. 
The love of one’s country is a sentiment that does one honor, 
and for which one will die. One knows his country througli 
its history and through its civic studies. In the same way one 
imows his own state, his own county, his own town. The more 
he knows of it the warmer his patriotism. Besides, one needs 
to know what mankind has done on the earth and with it, from 
the beginning until now, in a general way, in order to better 
understand things as they are now. So he needs to know the 
carth, where people are and how environed and conditioned and 
what they are now doing; what everybody has done is history, 
what everybody is now doing is geography. -If he is a part of 
the state and of the world he wants to know the récord and 
what is now going on, This gives him an idea of his duties as
-P-A-G-E-56
58 LecturEs ox ScH001 SUPERVISION 
a citizen and his rights as a man, and helps him keep his place 
in society and keep society in its place. 
Thus we have the scheme outlined and we see the needs of 
our coming man. Put into one statement it may be something 
like this: He will find himself in an organized society, with 
which he must communicate and to which he must contribute 
in order to live. He must recognize his own physical, spiritual ” 
and domestic needs and his obligations as a citizen in a regular 
government. This takes no account of his moral responsibilt- 
ties, of course, but that belongs to the churches as well as to 
the school. 
Reading. With all this in view we can now understand why 
the emphasis of a course of study should be placed wpon Lan- 
guage. This is the most important subject of all—how to talk, 
how to write, how to read with fluency, correctness, elegance, 
precision, with pleasure to one’s self and to others. The main 
business of the first year, indeed of the first two years, should 
he learning to read, and taking the first steps in writing, whick 
will involve spelling. Nearly .all the time should be devoted . 
to language in its many forms of expression. The first grade 
should learn to read. Then in the succeeding grades, book 
should follow book as safely as cireumstances allow. A grade 
should read in the second readers until it is able to read in the 
third readers, and so on. I seriously question the wisdom of 
rereading any book, if it is possible to arrange for an abundance 
of supplementary matter. I have known a grade to read five 
second readers before the teacher was satisfied to pass them into 
the third reader class. In some places the board furnishes 
text-books, but in places where they do not, it is well for the 
pupils to buy their own readers, and for the board to own the 
supplementary readers.

The doctrine of interest determines good reading. I have. 
anown a grade of poor readers to be revived into fair pupils by.” 
a new book, of new interest, which gave them something to 
read for. The one book a year course in reading is not en 
There should be a basal reader to dig in, work over, study from,. 
and then two or three others full of stories and descriptions just 
to read from and enjoy reading at sight without any stopping 
to be corrected, just to read and get all you can, and be helped 
over the hard places. In the basal reader the word is the thing.. 
In the supplementary reader the story is the thing. The one is 
study—the other is reading. The one is learning how, the other 
is doing. I commend unto you the practice of silent read-_ 
ing among the pupils. I have known a tired teacher almost 
to have a recess by handing around the supplementary 
readers and announcing fifteen minutes for everybody to read 
what he likes best, to be talked about afterwards. A child gets 
as much from silent reading as he does from oral reading. 
The School Library comes in from the fourth grade up. 
Every school should have a‘library, with as many books as there 
are pupils, a book for each one. The grade library is better 
than the general library, since it brings the pupils to a more 
intimate connection with the books, and calls the teacher’s at- 
tention to those who are and who are not reading. Ordinarily 
speaking, fifty books is a splendid library for a grade—books 
that the pupils will read, rather than those they ought to read 
and will not. 
Language Studies. Che unmistakable evidence of culture is 
the use cf language, whether it be in speech or in writing) Our 
speech betrays us; in fact, the tones of our voice, the precipi- 
taney, the loudness, the inaccuracy, the inelegance, or what not.

When we talk or write we must show what we know or what 
we do not know. Therefore, while learning to read and 
interpret other people’s thoughts, we should also learn how to 
express our own thoughts. Language exercises belong in all 
grades—the necessity for much speaking and for much writing. 
At the beginning teachers must correct those bad habits carried 
over from the preceding generation, that we call home influ- 
ences. Pupils should be taught to avoid the common errors 
and to adopt the conventional forms. Unless this is done early 
it will be too late, for once acquired a trick of speech clings 
forever. Therefore, the first several years of school life should 
be devoted to the foundation of proper habits of speech. These 
foundations will have the following clements—accuracy of 
speech, elegance of speech. Then follow in order one or two 
books on systematic language, study, and on into formal gram 
mar, which should not come until the seventh or eighth year 
of school life. 
Most people ‘are deficient in the power of original written 
composition. Few people write well with ease, rapidity, clear- 
ness and accuracy. There is not enough writing in the ordinary 
course of study. The old practice of compositions once a week 
was founded in good sense, and while its use was not always 
wise, yet it had its influence. The composition exercise suf 
fered from isolation and lack of relation to everything in par- 
ticular. One knows that in his own experience he often sits 
down to write a note or letter from a sense of obligation and 
frets over it, because he has nothing to say, while in a business 
matter he can turn out page after page and never pause for 
an idea or a word. It is the question of relation and expression 
of those ideas that are in us and must be poured out on the 
paper before us. Therefore, in the language course provide
-P-A-G-E-59
Tus SUPERINTENDENT AND THE Course or StuDY 61 
for much writing about things being studied, whether there be 
set compositions or not, and fluency, accuraey and elegance will 
follow. 
Arithmetic. After the language, the mathematical studies 
come next in importanee, and of these we are mainly concerned 
with Arithmetic. I would not advise pressing the matter of 
munbers upon pupils of the first grade. If the first four years 
are consumed in the elementary processes of addition, subtrac- 
lion, multiplication and division, preparing a grade of the fifth 
year to take up the matter of fractions, the progress is natural 
and normal. It is altogether probable that pupils can learn 
enough of arithmetic in six years to compass all the needed 
subjects, leaving the eighth and succeeding years to be devoted 
to algebra and other branches of mathematics. At any rate, 
it is sure that many needless subjects are dragged into the 
course and much time is consumed in teaching divisions of 
erithmetic that will need to be learned again, and in another 
way. Bank discount, exchange, carpeting, papering, partial 
payments and a number of subjects can well afford to be elimi- 
nated and more time put upon the general and universally 
applied rules and practices. 
All the conundrum problems that tease and vex teachers may 
be postponed for practice in the high school. What is essential 
is the abundance of simple, practical every-day problems that 
concern the business of life, and that are not mere mental 
puzzles for the sake of training the mind to think. I should 
certainly add oral arithmetic to the daily course, giving some 
ten or fifteen minutes practice in the rapid solution of prob- 
lems. Tn fact, I should insist that no problem that can be 
worked in the mind should ever be put on paper. This is good 
mental training, of the right sort.

Physiology. The familiar science of health should receive 
more attention than is given it. Every-day hygiene, the care 
of the body, the rnles of health, how we are made and how we 
should be cared for are vastly important in this world. What 
will one take for his health? What amount of money can buy 
your appetite, and your ability to digest anything you can 
swallow? Better to be well and strong, than to know all in the 
books or to be the child of great fortune. Yet we neglect this 
thing very much, er devote a short time only to its teaching, 
and practically nothing to its observance. The three things 
that support life, viz.: the food we eat, the water we drink, the 
air we breathe, are the three things about which ‘people are 
most careless. The science of physiology, the hygiene of the 
household, the chemistry of the kitchen, are more important 
than we appear to give them credit for. 
History. Next in rank come such studies as History, 
Oivies, and those which relate to the larger experience of man- 
kind in general and their doings upon the earth anywhere. 
While it is true that one can go through life ignorant of these 
subjects and still get. on very well, yet as culture studies they 
add greatly to his intellectual stature and to the pleasure he 
gets out of knowledge. Probably no other subject opens such a 
field for controversy and unfair teaching as history, and no 
subject can be touched in the high places only with so much 
advantage. We press history too much, especially the detail. 
The salient features only are important to a child, the anecdote 
side of it, the biography side of it.. Certainly, the controversial 
side of it should be left’ to colleges and university studies, if not 
postponed indefinitely It is well enough in the lower grades 
to read the stories of the great men of history, and for one or 
possibly two years in the last grades to read and discuss the
-P-A-G-E-61
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE Course or Stupy 63 
history more at length. But we emphasize history too much 
and the result is children do not enjoy it as they should. — 
Geography is the most interesting, comprehensive and beauti- 
full of all the studies. It embraces all the natural sciences, and 
opens up the field of nature study, observation lessons, field - 
studies and museum lessons to an endless variety and extent. 
There is practically no end to the subject of geography, and 
it is all valuable; that is to say, real geography. There. is 
cnough of valuable, interesting and easily obtained information 
on the subject for the live teacher to leave all the dull dotails 
alone. Probably no subject is harder to teach well than 
geography. The subject should be introduced in the first 
grades, by oral and field lessons. The text-book study should 
hegin about the fourth and fifth grades, and continue through 
the ninth grade. The superintendent will find this subject to 
Le one of the most dificult he will have to get the teachers to 
teach well. They will bury their noses in the book, and stick 
to the map questions, in spite of all he can do. In fact, one 
may almost go to the point of saying that the best and hardest 
test of a teacher is the way she gives a lesson in geography— 
more is needed for preparation than in any other study and 
there is more demand to interest and instruct children. 
- The Importance of State, County and Town Studies should not 
be forgotten. It would be valuable if there was a text-book on 
the county, or the city, for every system—written by the super- 
intendent, published by the board and loaned or given to. the 
pupils. This book should be studied in the last half of the 
eighth evade, and should concern itself with the history, 
topography, occupation, government, industrial possibilities, 
social advantages and topics of like nature. It is fair to say
-P-A-G-E-62
64 Lecrurzs on ScHoon SuPERvIsion 
that one needs to know intimately his own town, his own people, 
and to visit and understand the places of historic, ornamental 
and industrial interest. Through geography in its broadest 
aspect are our eyes open to the world in which we live, and tie 
people with whom we live, and the things by which we live. 
In all school courses we must regard such ornamental studies 
as music and art. They have a distinct value in life that does 
not deserve altogether the sweeping remark of Mz. Herbert 
Spencer that “as they oceupy the leisure part of life, so should 
they oecupy the leisure part of education.” The leisure part 
of life is as important as any part of life—in fact, we labor 
that we may accumulate the wherewith to enjoy our leisure 
hours. Pitable is the man who has no resources for his leisure 
hours—who does not love music, nor pictures, nor books, nor 
flowers. The man who loves music and flowers is not altogether 
bad. 
Drawing is a Form of Expression. We have ideas that cannot 
be spoken, nor sung, nor gesticulated.. They must be drawn. 
Who shall say whether the world will lose the most if the 
Parthenon be forgotten, or the Venus of Milo be broken, the 
Liad of Homer be lost, the musie of Bethoven be silenced, or 
the Sistine Madonna be destroyed? Each is a supreme ex- 
pression of its kind Can the world decide which it can afford 
to lose ? 
Drawing is the Foundation ot our Industries. All manual arts 
worthy the name are based on projection, design, calculation, 
measurement. They are first conceived in the mind, then rep- 
resented on paper, then reproduced in wood or metal as the 
case may be. The beginning of manual training is expression 
on paper of ideas in the mind. The profession has practically
-P-A-G-E-63
Tun SUPERINTENDENT AND THE CouRSsE oF Stupy 65 
committed itself to the introduction of manual training in the 
course of study. It is for me to advise you to keep your own 
mind clear, and not to rush into this or indeed into anything, 
just because somebody says it is a good thing. So in nature 
study, child study, and so in everything. But one cannot have 
everything in his school system, if he does the children will be 
heavily burdened with half performed tasks, and will finish 
with half satisfied minds. Unless you thoroughly understand 
what is proposed by manual training, unless you can start it 
properly in at least one grade, by one teacher, and can look for- 
ward to having an expert director, you had best not open up 
the subject to all your teachers and have them guessing in order 
for you to boast that you are keeping up with the procession. 
In other words, follow your own head, and not another’s dic- 
tation, but be alert to get more light, in order to have a clear 
view of what is doing in the world. The best superintendent is 
he who wants to have what is best, who seeks incessantly to find 
out what is best, but who enterprises nothing in his course of 
study but what he understands and believes in. If you do not 
believe in it, do not do it. 
In making then your course of study, it must be an expression 
ot what you believe in, as evidenced by your reading, your 
observation, your reflection, and particularly as modified by the 
conditions that prevail in your school system. You may not 
have everything you believe in for lack of money, or the support 
of your board or people. You may have to wait, but whatever 
you do, put your head and heart in it—-then it is yours. 
Do not be Afraid to Experiment with the Course of Study. It 
will necd fixing every year. It can be improved all the time, 
and like any good machine or device it needs to be studied con- 
stantly in order to devise improvements or prevent deteriora-

tion. I do not mean that text-beoks need to be changed every 
year—that would not be wise, hut I mean that the preeise point 
and method of applying the text-book, in what quantities and at 
what times, is a matter of constant experiment. 
I would not advise you to subdivide your course of study, or 
lay out daily schedules too minutely. Leave something for 
your teachers to do. The superintendent who boasted that he 
could look at his watch and tell what each teacher in the fifth 
grade was doing at that hour, had reduced system to the 
deadly point. He had too much order in his system, and the 
teachers were oppressed by his regulations. I think that if the 
year’s work is outlined, and if it be divided into two parts, each 
part being called a term’s work, you have done enough, and 
then leave each teacher to her pace. 
As I said before, do not be too strict about grade divisions 
in your course of study. The great thing is to go on. Every- 
thing should make way for the child, and if a elass has com 
pleted the fifth year’s work by March, and is able and willing 
to go on into the sixth year’s work, let them go on. It is a crime 
to hold them back. This is disorder but it is good sense, and 
if the system gets mixed up by it, then mixing up is a good 
thing. .

road, headed. in the same direction, though they may scatter 
along according to their pace. You can do a great help to your 
schools by making your manual inspiring and helpful, especially 
to the young teachers. They. all want to know what to do, and 
the manual is a continual lecture, ready at hand, a word from 
you on all sorts of subjects, giving your ideas of how things 
should be. Do not oppress your teachers with too much method, © 
or too much rule. Such regulations as that a teacher must stand 
to teach, must not ever look in the book, etc., are unnecessary 
and foolish. Be helpful, watchful, inspiring and stimulating, 
and the course of study will get smoother and smoother as it 
worn by the many feet of its happy travelers.

Lecture VI 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE 
PUPILS 
The purpose of a school system is to educate the children of 
a community. The best system is that which reaches the great- 
est number of children and accomplishes the best work with 
them. The child is the object toward which all plans move. It 
is for his benefit that all schools are, on him rests the future 
welfare of the country and the race. Therefore, let us not lose 
sight of the child. 
In the old system of education, and even to-day in the un- 
graded and rural schools, a great deal of attention is paid and 
can be paid to the individual child. Under the private school 
system, and in the ordinary public schools of the rural districts, 
there are no grades. Every child enters upon a course of study 
and takes it as fast. as he can or as leisurely as he may. Thereit 
lies one of the excellencies of country schools. But in the city 
schools it is necessarily different. Children come to the schools 
in battalions and are graded by years or months and all of one 
degree are put together in one grade and there they stay until 
a certain portion of the course of study has been satisfactorily 
gone over, then they are promoted. This is one of the almost 
unavoidable evils of the city schools. 
Ideally speaking, education does not come by grades or 
degrees. These divisions are artificial and are born of conven- 
lence and necessity. Children should be allowed to take their
-P-A-G-E-67
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PUPILS 69 
own pace in getting their development, mental and physical. If 
I should undertake to preseribe ideal conditions I should say 
that 
1. Every child should be allowed all possible freedom to 
get his education as fast as is consistent with his mental and 
physical health. 
2. Every indifferent child should be stimulated by proper 
incentives to assume the rate that is normal for one of his years. 
8. Every teacher should have no more pupils to teach than 
she can manage by individuals, giving each one liberty to ad- 
vance beyond his fellows and move beyond her jurisdiction. 
But these are ideal conditions and require ideal teachers, 
ideal equipment and plenty of money. The best we can do is 
to approximate ideals and take into consideration our oppor- 
tunities, our necessities, our limitations and our circumstances, 
and then do the best we can. 
Flexible Grading. It seems to me quite certain that there are 
some reforms that are possible and that are needed in our city 
schools for the benefit of the pupils, and one of these is a more 
flexible grading. It is quite evident that children are not all 
of the same intellectual power, nor have the same opportunities 
of attendance, nor attention at home, nor. degrees of health. 
Therefore, the year’s interval between classes yokes together 
the bright and eager, and the dull and listless. This does both 
’n injustice. We should provide for some to go on as fast as 
they can, and for others to take their time. 
lt is all right for a system of schools to be divided into eight 
grades below the high school, and for each grade to be under 
charge of a separate teacher, and to correspond to about a year’s - 
work, But to say that it shall correspond to a year’s work, no
-P-A-G-E-68
70 LectuREs ON ScHoot SUPERVISION 
more and no less, is too harsh a treatment for many pupils. It 
_ gtades the school by the calendar, and makes the course of study 
according to the nionths rather than to the pupils. We need 
to make the grades more flexible so that a pupil can be advanced 
into higher work whenever he is ready for it regardless of his 
slower or duller companions. 
Annual promotions are too far apart, even semi-annual pro- 
motions are unnecessarily far apart. The bright ones become 
impatient to go on-—to take longer, harder lessons—to advance 
into other territory. In other words, to be promoted ; to study 
something else. This can be accomplished by a subdivision of 
each grade into sections, in the essential studies, each section 
corresponding to about eight or ten weeks’ time, and at regular 
and short intervals, have a regrading or reclassifying of pupils. 
This will necessitate such an arrangement and rearrange- 
ment of recitation and study schedules that any pupils who have 
completed the work of any section, can find a teacher ready to 
take up the beginning of the next higher section. Instead of 
each teacher beginning the course of study for her grade once a 
year, she begins it every eight or ten weeks, receiving pupils 
and passing them on to a higher section in her own room, and 
so on until they have passed all her sections and on into the 
next grade. 
Suppose forty-five pupils enter the first grade in September, 
fifteen of these went to school the last two months of the 
previous year, fifteen are new, but bright, and fifteen are new 
but dull. There are three sections then, in September. Section 
‘No. 1 takes up the first reader, and studies the numbers, 6, 7, 
8, 9 and 10, and by December having finished the first grade 
work, is passed into the second grade. In the meantime section 
2 has moved up and now becomes section 3, or at least many of
-P-A-G-E-69
Tae SUPERINTENDENT AND THE Purim bid 
them do. Some have been sick, some kept busy, some jc 
most of them are advanced and are now called section 3, 
of the dull ones have waked up and are ready for the ¥ 
section 2. So that the teacher can announce to the super 
ent that she can start a new section No. 1 with any beginners 
who may be outside waiting to get in. So that the teacher in 
grade No, 1 has promoted one section to grade No, 2, has ad- 
vanced two other sections to higher work in her own room and 
started again with a fresh lot of pupils. co 
In the meantime the teacher in grade No. 2 has done the 
same thing and passed one section on to grade No. 3 to make 
room for the new pupils from the grade below, and has begun 
her work for section 1 again. This goes on throughout every 
grade even to the high school, and gives every pupil a chance 
to make his own record. By this regrading a pupil can compass 
section work more rapidly than the regular rate prescribed, can 
go from section 1 to section 8, and in many ways has a chance 
for saving time. In a school system of eight grades or years 
a bright boy or girl may compass the course in six or seven 
years, while the plodders are at liberty to take their leisure. .

out a plan that promises good results. Our plan is to see — 
tion the work of each year into two or three parts, and to 
allow each teacher to take the brightest section of her classes as 
far as possible, regardless of the prescribed year’s work of her 
grade. At the end of the year only is there a change of teachers, 
‘and children are regraded rather than promoted. A number of 
pupils may be advanced to another teacher or grade with half 
the work already done in the grade below. In which event the. 
teacher will take up where the other teacher left off rather than . 
begin where the catalogue prescribes. By this means a bright

section of pupils will ultimately gain one or maybe two years 
in the school curriculum. 
Examination. For years the schools of the country have been 
oppressed with the nightmare of examinations. The finals, the 
semi-finals, the quarterlies, the monthlies, all to be written and 
rewritten, have been the source of more real agony and heart- 
ache, and cramming and cheating than any other one thing in 
our school system. Formerly final examinations were used as 
a, test for promotion, in spite of every obvious reason why it 
was unfair, unreliable and unnecessary. But we all did it, and 
the innocents were slaughtered. Fortunately we are coming to 
our senses now, and there is not much more heard about the 
final examinations. ‘We have come to look the fact in the face 
that education is profressive daily, and that there is no such 
thing as promotion exactly, any more than a child is promoted 
when he passes from being seven year's of age and becomes eight 
of age®.. He is growing all the time. There are transi 
in his edueation from subject to subject, from division to 
on and from teacher to teacher, but these are not serious 
: or leaps, like great ditches which demand his strength 
.. ...e or else he must go far back and take another start. .—~ 
’ 
Written Tests. I believe in examinations, daily, weekly, at 
any time and at all time. But they are tests of what a child 
can do and what he knows, and are for the purpose of giving 
information to those who need it, and giving power of expres- 
sion to the pupil. These written tests ought to be made at all’ 
times and the results laid aside for comparison. The tests for 
October should be kept to compare with the tests for Novem- 
ber, and then with December, and the tests for May ought te 
show the best results of all.
-P-A-G-E-71

‘Furthermore, those written tests should be done in the very 
best style. No scratch paper and pencil and any sort of writing, 
so it is correct, but pen and ink for those who know how, and 
vniform paper, and best style. There is education in record 
work, Ii is the time when we not only do our best but we put 
on our best appearance. ‘There is stimulant in style. I have 
even found that elegance and accuuracy are ready companions 
It seems always a pity not to have a fine piece of work accurate 
in every detail. 
Teacher’s Judgment. There is no escape from the proposition 
that a teacher’s judement should be the tribunal that decides 
4 pupil’s fitness for passing beyond the jurisdiction of her grade 
into charge of another teacher. There may result some errors 
at times, for the personal equation is ever present in all things 
that humans do, but the likelihood of gross injustice is reduced 
when we trust the opinions of those who do the teaching 
_tather than the chance product of written examination. 
The Recitation. The public school system has its limitations, 
and one of these limitations is the almost impossibility of indi- 
vidualizing the instruction. The class is the necessary result of 
the grade and is one of the attendants of a public school system. 
We grade a school when we resolve it into classes, for recitation 
purposes. These classes save time in instruction by multiplying 
the teacher’s power and time according to the number of pupils 
engaged. But a recitation has certain principles that a teacher 
should know and should enforce. 
1. No greater number should be engaged in one recita- 
tion than the teacher can well handle, and care for. The 
‘younger the pupils the fewer should be taught at one time. 
in the kindergarten twelve is enough for one teacher to have.
-P-A-G-E-72
74 Lecrures on Scuoon SurErRvision 
Tn the primary grades fifteen at one timo is quite enough. In 
the upper grades the number may be increased, until for some 
studies the entire grade may be at work at one time. 
2. Class teaching and individual learning are consistent. 
A teacher is in error when she teaches the individual and allows 
the class to be inattentive. She should deliver instruction in 
such a way that each individual will be profited by what is told 
to all. A class should be handled as it were one. Every eye 
should be fixed. Every mind busy, and every edge cut. Devices 
should be adopted, methods employed that involve the entire 
class in the work. 
3. A recitation should not continue any longer than atten- 
tion can be healthily sustained. In the upper grades a recita-- 
tion can safely continue longer than in the lower grades. When 
pupils are interested in the subject and manner of the recitation 
there is less strain, than when everything is dull. However, 
it is possible to sustain the attention too long by such exercises 
as oral arithmetic, and carry the brain forces to the point of 
exhaustion. I do not believe in too much exhiliration for class 
work. J think a reasonable amount of stimulant is well, but a 
child suffers who is allowed excessive nervous strain. It is the 
steady, hourly, daily, pull without strain that gradually settles 
into fixed habit of industry, and which counts in the long run. 
A mule that can walk fast and jog steadily will make more 
miles in a week than a quarter horse. 
4, The real purpose of the recitation is instruction on the 
part. of the teacher. A school divides itself into two parts, those 
who are reciting to the teacher, and those who are studying for 
themselves. Those who are reciting should be advancing into 
new territory, learning new things, having difficulties explained 
and new ways marked out. Pupils should go forward with
-P-A-G-E-73
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PuPILs 75 
their teacher and review at home. Recitation work is initiative, 
advancing, explanatory. Parents say, and justly so, that chil- 
dren Jearn at home and recite at school, and that the parents are 
the real teachers. This arises from the fact that some teachers 
have the habit of saying to a class “take the next case” or “the 
next lesson,” without any thought or explanation of its contents 
or difficulties. It would be better for the child to approach a 
new case first in the class, have the teacher explain all about 
the new case, and how the examples are worked, then if home 
work is to be done, it can be and should be-in the nature of a 
review and does not demand the explanatory powers of the 
whole family. Children miss a great deal when they are denied 
the help of a good teacher who sees in the hour for recitation an 
opportunity for doing more than finding out how well a child 
has studied at home. 
Home Work. So far as home work. for pupils is concerned 
the less there is of that the better. Five hours a day of real 
intellectual work at school is enough for a growing boy or girl, 
this side of a high school, and even in the high school not. more 
than an hour at home should be required. It grieves me to 
know that some children spend the blessed hours of the after- 
noon poring over the lesson, when they should be romping at 
their play. If we would keep the health of the pupils we must 
allow for an abundance of movement, of out doors, of open air 
exercise. “What shall it profit a man if he gain the world of 
knowledge and lose his own health ?” 
Besides, it is well for the discipline of a school that pupils 
study in school. They have something to do, and are kept out 
of mischief. School is the place and time for mental occupa- 
tion, and if a boy is busy for four or five hours a day learning 
things, he has spent enough time at that.) He needs the rest of
-P-A-G-E-74
76 Lectures on Scroon Supmrviston 
daylight to forget things. All physicians are telling us to care 
for the health of the pupils, not to crowd or overstrain their 
brains, nor confine them to the rooms, nor restrict their play. 
This advice is good. Health is first. Better to know less and 
be well in body, than be a dyspeptic savant. Therefore, it is 
well to avoid much keeping in at recess, or after school, and to 
dismiss the lower grades earlier in the day than the upper 
grades. Generally speaking, few pupils are benefited by being 
kept in for not knowing their lessons. Under the plan of recita- 
tion I have advocated above the terrors of keeping in for missed 
lessons will be done away with, for there can be no missed lesson 
when every recitation is distinctly an advance into new and 
unexplained fields. 
Occupation. Occupation is a great aid to discipline in a 
school. When the mind is oceupied the hands and feet are out 
of mischief. The danger hours are the leisure hours. The idle 
brain is the tempter’s opportunity. The reason that new teach- 
ers fail in discipline is because they cannot keep the school 
occupied in work or thoughtful in study. 
Discipline. By discipline is meant that orderly arrangement 
in a school which affords every child the greatest degree of 
bodily comfort and mental freedom. A school room is in order 
when it is at work, and disorder is oftentimes more apparent 
than real. A teacher should allow for necessary noise, moving 
about, and the hum of industry. Let it not make her nervous. 
It is the sign that things are moving. At best our desks are 
very uncomfortable things, and children are not to blame for 
finding them hard and impossible to enjoy for hours at a time. 
Therefore, for the sake of discipline, have an abundance of 
rest, of movement, of change, and just as much liberty as you 
can without degenerating into positive license.

Tae Bad Boy. However, there are still in the world boys and 
even girls that vex a teacher’s spirit. They are of many sorts, 
the nervous boy, the mischievous boy, the mean boy, the bad 
boy, the stupid boy, the lazy boy, ete., ete. For all such the 
public schools are made, and it is for the imps that salvation is 
designed. There are bad boys I know in every school. It 
cannot be helped. Yet how earnest our efforts should be to 
save that bad boy. THe may not be bad after all, but only 
misunderstood. He is surely worth all of our effort. 
Resistance. Much has been said from time to time about 
the debasing influences of public schools, because all sorts of 
boys and girls attend, that bad and good are mixed up together, 
and the old adage of a bad’apple in a barrel is constantly before 
us, But the adage dees not apply, for good apples have no 
powers of resistance and boys have. A bad apple cannot be 
made good, and a bad boy can. Of course, there are bad boys 
in sehool as there are bad men in life, and if we keep our boys 
away from bad influences what powers will they ever have to 
resist temptation when it comes in their way? The best plan 
is not to keep the boys away from evil hoping thereby to keep 
them good, but rather to have them resist the evil influences 
and thereby make them strong. Education consists in power, 
power io do, and power not to do; power to persist and power 
to resist. Iam not grieved when my boy hears bad language, 
but T am grieved when he is tempied to use it. A school is life 
aud the element of evil is an important one for the education 
of these who would know how to withstand it. Thereby the 
bad boy has his uses. He may become too bad, I admit, and 
should be dispensed with, but ordinarily let no parent fret be- 
cause there are bad boys in the world. They have their uses 
as object lessons of evil.

Mischievous Boy. I think it is time to defend the .vis 
chievous boy. Teachers consider him a nuisance because he is 
so noisy, and must forever be kept down. He is eternally av 
something, always alert, with a smart answer ready and finishes 
his tasks in plenty of time to get into mischief. He is gener- 
ally a leader, and is generous and nobleminded. But he is a 
nuisance and we are glad when he is not at school, things are so 
peaceful. But let us consider that mischievous boys have made 
the world what it is. The boy who is hard to keep down in school, 
will be hard to keep down in the world. The boy who asks 
hard questions in school, will give hard questions to his fellow- 
men. The boy that leads his companions in their sports will 
continue to lead them in their pursuits. The shrinking, timid, 
quiet boy may be a great pleasure to the teacher but the world 
needs qualities different. And school is not merely a prepara- 
tion for life, it is life: the very beginning of the great struggle 
and the great triumpb. 
T shall not close this talk without having you consider that 
part of our instruction that is often disregarded, or is passed 
over too lightly. I refer to the instruction in morals and 
manners. 
The Bible. I believe the Bible should be taught in our 
schools. It represents the foundation of our laws, our civiliza- 
tion and our religions. Whatever the modern world is, it owes 
to the Christian religion. And this without reference to ereeds 
or doctrines or denominations. There is enough platform in 
the Bible, common to all people, for us all to stand on without 
one saying to another “you do not belong here.” Every day 
should be begun by reading the Bible, short, impressive and 
with little or no comment, certainly none of a doctrinal sort

For years the public school children of Augusta have given 
thousands of packages of clothing and groceries to the poor on 
Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas, and better than mere bring- 
ing them to school, they have distributed them among the 
homes of the poor themselves. What a splendid lesson in help 
to the needy. 
Similarly about the manners of the pupils. The time spent 
in insisting upon politeness, thoughtfulness, carefulness, neat- 
ness, and all those qualities that betray an inward culture is 
time better spent than in scolding and in keeping in. After all, 
aman is known by his habits, and we get our habits when we 
are young, and are in school, and they have but little to do with 
what we know. What we learn out of our books is one thing, 
what habits we acquire is another, and good habits are better 
than much learning. Ruskin says that “education does not 
eonsist in teaching men to know what they otherwise would 
not know but rather in teaching them to behave as they would 
not otherwise behave.” 
What our pupils get from the teacher is attitude. The 
superintendent should see that this attitude toward life is the 
vorrect one and that the faces are turned toward the light.

THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE 
SCHOOL PRINCIPAL 
The office of principal or head master is one of the inventions 
of the medern school system. We may say that it is an inven- 
tion that has grown out of necessity. The functions of a prin- 
cipal are very like those of a superintendent in a restricted 
way. When properly organized, the principals can be of great 
service in carrying out the plan of close and expert supervision. 
Every large school, say of 200 or more pupils, should have 
a principal. This principal is more than the teacher of the 
highest grade in the building. He is the head of the building 
and in charge of all of it. .He ranks next to the superintendent, 
receives orders from him, and carries out his plans in the detail 
workings of the building. 
Male Principals Preferred. We may as well discuss here the 
undecided question of whether a man or a woman should be 
at the head of a building. I cheerfully acknowledge that I have 
visited many buildings in charge of women, where the work 
was all that could be desired. Also I have visited some other 
buildings of which men were in charge where the work was 
abominable. In these instances I find the fact that there are 
many women in the world with all the vigor and strength 
necessary for almost any position. Also that there are many 
men in the world not fit for anything. 
However, I may as well bravely say, that taking into consid-
-P-A-G-E-79
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHOOL CHILDREN 81 
eration that the question is between a good man and a good 
woman, that it is hést to put a good man. at. the head of a large 
school. Let me recount the arguments: 
1. All children need the father side of their education de- 
veloped as well as the mother side. The contact with the 
gentlewomen in the lower grades gives that grace and refine- 
ment that only good wemen can transmit. by their influence. 
The contact with a man in the upper grades gives that strength 
and manliness that only a good man can transmit. It needs 
both man and woman to shape the character of the coming 
generation. 
2. There are facts in the instruction of boys that only a 
man ean dare to teach, and he must needs be a very wise man 
te do this, It is quite certain that no woman can do it, and 
ihat parents are neglectful of it. This instruction should come 
ts boys before they reach the high school grade. 
3. 'Theve are times in the discipline of boys that the facts 
cannot bear the investigation of a woman, and a man’s presence 
is needed to deal wisely and firmly with a full knowledge of 
all that happened. So far as the girls are concerned there are 
always plenty of good women in the building who will under- 
take this delicate instruction and discipline. Both sexes are 
provided for when there is a man at the head and a corps of 
good women to assist him. 
4. In large emergencies, such as conflicts with parents, or 
rebellions pupils, or in cases of fire or panic, the stronger nerve. 
of the man is more likely to control the school affairs to the 
hest purpose. In the larger enterprises, such as community 
work in investigating parental conditions, or providing enter- 
taimment or instruction for the adult population of the school
-P-A-G-E-80
82 Luecturxs on Scroon SuPpERviston 
neighborhood, the greater freedom of man’s life brings greater 
opportunity for good work. 
I do not say that women do not make good principals, I zub- 
mit that men should make better principals. here are too 
many facts to the contrary. I merely argue that all things 
being equal, a man’s nature and a man’s freedom brings 
larger opportunity and a surer result than is possible for 
women, on account of the necessary limitations of sex. In the 
organizing of a large system of schools, the men should be put 
at the head of the large school buildings, and all their assistants 
should be women. 
Every principal should be the supervising officer of his 
building. The amount of actual teaching he should do depends 
on the size of the building and the demands of his supervisory 
work. He may find that one hour a day will be sufficient, or 
two hours, but it is easily conceivable that in a sehool of 400 
or 500 children, with ten to twelve teachers, he may have little 
or no time for actual teaching. 
Therefore, the principals should have no regularly assigned 
grade of pupils to sit in his room. Pupils should come to him 
trom other grades to recite, or to be reviewed and tested, or to 
hear lectures, or stand examinations. He cannot supervise 
closely and teach a whole grade, unless he has but four or five 
teachers, who need but little help from him. According to the 
plan of supervising principals, the first hour or more is needed 
for general inspection, attending cases of tardiness and dis- 
order. He may then have regularly assigned classes to come 
to him for instruction. Certainly after recess hour he needs 
to visit his weak grades, or have them sent to his room for 
special work. By this means he knows what is going on every- 
where and anywhere in his building.

Relation to the Superimtendent. As we have just remarked, 
the principal stands next i. rank to the superintendent. He is 
the officer in command of <hat section or division of the force, 
and is to be held responsible for whatever goes on under his 
jurisdiction, This being true the superintendent acts upon 
the building through the principal and not directly. If he has 
any orders to send out they are handed down to the principal. 
If he sees anything out of order, he calls the attention of the 
principal to it. This repose and center of authority has a 
strengthening effect upon the system, because it divides the 
responsibility and labors, arouses a pride and interest in the 
entire building, and brings all the work under a close super- 
vision. . 
The principals then form the council or cabinet of the super- 
intendent, and are entitled to his fullest confidence. With 
them he can discuss all his plans and measures for the improve- 
ment of the schools, and ean correct his own judgment by hav- 
ing the opinions of those in daily contact with the conditions. 
To this end the principals should have a regular association and 
a weekly meeting with the superintendent for conference .and 
reports and disenssions. These meetings should be without 
Prepared program, should be informal and easy, and all the 
talk should be about the work. Everything said should be in 
the strictest confidence because the utmost candor is necessary 
in order to effect the needed reforms. This then is the cabinet 
meeting and it discusses the gravest issues of the administra- 
tion. Some of its effects are: 
1. To dignify the office of the principal, and to strengthen 
the immediate head of each building. It is am office much neg- 
lected and much imposed upon. It needs more dignity and 
More attention. It can be made the means of perfect super- 
vision if the superintendents will treat it properly.
-P-A-G-E-82
84 Lectures on ScrooL SUPERVISION 
2. To enlarge the views of each principal by comparing 
work with the others. He avcids rvs and routine, he gets new 
ideas and plans, he compares methods of management, finds - 
out where he is weak and how others have avoided his troubles 
or met his difficulties. Ile gets good advice for special cases 
brought up for consideration, and is sustained or correeted by 
the opinions of those at the same work as himself. 
3. It simplifies the labor of the superintendent in that it 
brings before him for conference those whom he needs most to 
instruct and inspire, and throngh whom he. can enthuse the 
whole body of teachers. Instead ef having but one devoted 
laborer for the schools he has many, for the: principals feel that 
the superintendent’s cause is their cause, and that they form a 
part of the machinery. that is lifting the schools to higher 
planes. 
4. It does away with much jealousy or rivalry among the 
teachers of the various schools of a school system. It avoids 
those envies that make the life of a superintendent unhappy 
and retard his movements. It creates a better sentiment 
toward the superintendent himself and prevents that unfor- 
tunate condition of antognism, that often makes the principals 
and teachers inert, if not actively against any proposed plan 
for improvement. THis plans become “our plans,” and we must 
stand by our own. No more running to board members to 
talk about the orders, no more objections or obstacles. They 
are “our plans” and we will try to carry them out. The super- 
intendent is “our leader” and not our master, and we are his 
enthusiastic followers. It is a happy condition for the schools 
when the teachers say, “we are trying to do so and so” instead 
of “the superintendent has ordered us to do so and so.”
-P-A-G-E-83
Tur SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHOOL CHILDREN 85 
5. Finally a principal’s association can institute uniform 
test work for all the buildings, can compare these results and 
make averages. By these means a principal can see where he 
stands in relation to other buildings, can compare his teachers’ 
work and can give the superintendent an easy means of test 
work for the entire system. 
The principal keeps all the records and makes all the reports 
for his buildings. He is the center of the statistical part of 
his section, and is responsible for all information of all sorts 
that should be kept, information regarding total attendance, 
cases of absence or tardiness, averages and percentages, of in- 
crease or decrease. He keeps the alphabetical list of all pupils 
in his buildings, with their records of percentage, residence, 
home conditions, their entrance, promotion, detention, trans- 
ference to another building, or withdrawal from school. So 
that the superintendent can call him up over the telephone at 
his office in the building and inquire about any pupil, and in 
five minutes all the facts come back in detail. That is system. 
Lastly, the superintendent pays the accounts of each build- 
ing through the principal. At the regular pay day the consoli- 
dated amount due to the teachers and help about each building 
is turned over to the principal, who receipts for the whole 
amount. He then distributes it to the individuals who receipt 
to him. This makes the principal the paymaster for his build- 
ing, thereby lightening the duties of the treasurer, or the 
superintendent, or whoever has the finances of the schools in 
keeping. 
" Relation to the Teachers. ‘The principal is the immediate 
Supervising officer of the tedchers, and they are directly re- 
sponsible to him for direction and advice, and are entitled to
-P-A-G-E-84
86 Lectures on ScHoor SUPERVISION 
all the assistance they need in the discharge of their duties. 
The teachers should early learn their dependence upon the 
strength and vigor of their principal, and should have confi- 
dence in his ability to direct them, in his willingness to help 
them, in his justice and impartiality toward them, and in his 
strength to defend them, 
Therefore they obey his orders promptly and with cheerful- 
ness. They may advise with him regarding what is best, but 
when an order is handed down it goes without comment and 
without hesitation. Prompt and implicit obedience is one of 
the necessities of any organization—an obedience that is cheer- 
ful and loyal and co-operative; that does its best. and keeps its 
counsel. The responsibility rests with those who give the 
order, the duty of subordinates is to carry it out. There are 
two virtnes I love in a teacher—one is loyalty, that makes ber 
carry out an order and never say a word, that makes her 
defend the schools or hold her peace. And the other is effort— 
that commits her to an eternal persistence to do what is set 
before her to do, and this very persistence is almost a guarantee 
of success. 
The principal should know the detail work in every grade 
of his building. He should be able to advise with the first 
grade teachers about phonics and the eighth grade teachers 
about physics. He should know something of knife work in 
wood for the boys and sewing for the girls. He ought to answer 
the fourth grade teachers when they want to know about mak- 
ing relief maps, or where to go to study the geology of their 
neighborhood. In fact, the principal needs to be an all around 
teacher, disciplinarian, and man of affairs. His supervision of 
the work should not, conflict with the outlines of the superin- 
tendent, but should rather be in the nature of earrying out pre-
-P-A-G-E-85
Tux SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHOOL CHILDREN 87 
arranged plans. He should know the superintendent’s outlines 
and ideas, and his work in the grades will be in furtherance of 
the general scheme of instruction and management. 
It is the principal’s duty to see that the teachers of the build- 
ing are supplied with all necessary materials and supplies. 
They look to him rather than to the superintendent for those 
things. He stands between them and the superintendent in 
all matters as far as he can, and should have a supply depart- 
ment for the teachers of his building. 
Likewise should they send to him all cases of complaints 
from outside in which parents are concernned. THe is the man 
that stands between the teacher and the outside world. The 
patrons appeal to the principals if they are not satisfied and 
the principal makes it right with the teacher. When parents 
are incensed against individual teachers for supposed griev- 
ances, it is always for the principal and superintendent to in- 
tervene and have the wrath drawn off a little before the actual 
parties face each other. While I believe it is well at all times to 
bring the parents and the teachers face to face in case of con- 
troversy and have them talk it over, yet if the principal is pres- 
ent, and has previously heard both sides, generally grievances 
will prove to be fancied, and. quarrels will be averted. We 
may say here that it is the duty of a principal to stand by his 
teachers, and to let them know he can be relied on. The par- 
ents cannot bulldoze, nor bully nor browbeat him. He is there to 
stand up for his teachers, and to protect them. Even when 
they are wrong he must be relied on to see that they are not 
insulted or abused. He, himself, will treat them with perfect 
gentility, perfect impartiality, a degree of cordiality that never 
approaches familiarity, will preserve a dignity that requires 
his subordinates to be formal, without being afraid, and will
-P-A-G-E-86
88 Lecturns on ScHoou SupERVISION 
never indulge in words or manners that offend his teachers by 
the rudeness, or roughness, or injustice, or haste, or condescend 
to such flippancy or flattery as may lower their high regard for 
his dignity and worth. A principal had best err on the side 
of too much formality rather than too much familiarity in 
dealing with his teachers. 
Relation to the Pupils. The principal is in general charge of 
the entire school. All offences against individual rooms come 
under the jurisdiction of the grade teacher. 
Tardiness or absence is an offence against the entire school, 
and as such belongs to the principal. There is a deterring effect 
in knowing that the principals must be faced when children 
loiter or are detained at home. His very presence is more 
stimulating to punctuality than the severest measures of their 
daily teacher. The opening part of every day’s session should 
be devoted by him to those cases that are necessarily absent or 
tardy, and each one dealt with according to its value. 
You will pardon me for referring to the question of ex- 
cuses. Every child who is tardy or absent should be required 
to explain the fact to the principal in writing by a note from 
the parents. A printed form for that purpose will save time 
by explaining to the parents the necessity for it. The form 
should contain the law and the reason for it and a space for the 
written excuse. If a child is absent or tardy and comes with 
no excuse from his parents he should be given a blank form 
and required to bring it filled out the next day, under penalty 
of being sent home for it. 
As to what constitutes an excuse. I venture to plead for 
the simplicity of receiving any request, with or without rea- 
son assigned as sufficient explanation of the child’s delinquency.
-P-A-G-E-87
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHOOL CHILDREN 89 
It Has always seemed to me a sort of impertinence on the part 
of teachers to demand of parents the reason why their children , 
‘are detained from school. We have nothing to do with the 
reason, and there is no jurisdiction over the home life of the 
child that compels his attendance daily, or obliges him to ex- 
plain. 
It saves time and trouble to abide by the simple device of 
a written statement from the parent explaining that the child’s 
absence from school was due to his parents detaining him at 
home. The purpose of the written note is to inform. the teach- 
er that the absence was not caused. by truancy, and that the 
child was not to blame. 
This naturally leads us to consider the question of punish- 
ment. Theoretically speaking, in ideal communities everybody 
would be good and there would be no punishment. In ideal 
schools every child is good and there would be no punishments. 
Tn this world of sin the divine law has provided that those, 
who err must suffer. So must it be with schools—more’s the 
pity. Until we have ideal children to teach there can be no 
government without a penal side. It is so with men because 
it isin human nature. However, let us be wise about it. Let 
the principal see that his building is not governed by fear, hut 
by love of the work. Let the rod be on hand, but out of sight. 
Tet the teacher be slow to punish as she should be slow to 
wrath, and let the punishment be private if possible. It is 
a sad crisis in a school when a child has to be whipped. It is 
4 condition when the teacher who is physically able and has 
the authority deliberately decides that bodily pain is the only 
temedy, for the trouble at hand. 
Therefore let the principal keep up closely with the cases 
of corporal punishment, and never allow them to oceur except
-P-A-G-E-88
90 LecturREs ON ScHoon SUPERVISION 
when necesssary to quell insurrection or subordination, oto 
decide the pupil’s own appeal to arms. \ 
Young teachers rush to arms. The’ children are enemies, ' 
they must be repelled, and put down. ‘Tyros are always look- 
ing for trouble and they generally find it. It is a confes- 
sion of incapacity and weakness. Those who punish the most 
accomplish the least. The rod is a poor disciplinarian, and 
force has never yet developed a good man out of a mean boy. 
Suspension should be the rare event of once in many years, for 
as there are some men whom society puts out of the way by ex- 
ecution, so there are some sad instances of bad boys who were 
spoiled before the school had a chance to save them and whom 
the school is better without. 
Relation to Yards and Buildings, The principal has charge of 
the buildings and grounds. He is the custodian of the school 
property, and is responsible for everything that may occur 
to it, The superintendent has an opportunity to simplify 
itis own work by directing that certain repairs or im 
provements be made and designating the way in which they 
shall bé done, and then turning the supervision of the work 
over to the principal. In general the work will be done better 
and cheaper because the principal will have a pride in the re 
sult. This is but another way of relieving the superintendent 
of that detail which isso harassing to a man whose business 
it is to think largely and plan broadly. 
The principal should employ and dismiss the janitors. They 
are his workmen and responsible to him, subject to his employ- 
ment and dismissal. These janitors should be required not 
only to keep the building clean and in order, but should at- 
tend to the wants of the teachers. To do this he should wear
-P-A-G-E-89
Tun SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHOOL CHILDREN 91 
a white coat and put on style. If there is one thing that is 
out of harmony, it is to see a fine school house attended by a 
coatless janitor, whose personal appearance is an indication of 
the carelessness of his work. Every school building should 
be provided with a front door bell, and an electric system of 
call bells, and the janitor should answer with the dispatch and 
manners of the service of a hotel. It is a good object lesson 
in house keeping that will not be lost on teachers and pupils. . 
The principal has charge of the play grounds and his pres- 
ence is advisable at the recess. He is needed to prevent the 
exuberant pupils from overflowing in their sport and running 
over the weak and helpless. He can guide the games and be 
umpire of disputes. It is a great field for principal’s thought 
—this of children’s games. How often he knows that cer- 
tain sports are too rough but he eannot think of anything bet- 
ter. A good principal knows what to play and how to play it, 
and can start all sorts of games that boys like. His assistants 
can be with the girls and perform similar service. Also we 
might remark that the principal needs the recess as well as the 
pupils, that he and all his teachers need a lunch and exercise 
and fresh air and relief of mind for the thirty minutes that 
come in the middle of the day, while the windows are up and 
the school rooms are blown out. I wonder how long it will 
be before we get to the proposition that no child need be de- 
prived of his play for missing his lesson, and that recess in 
full and certainly in part is the inalienable right of every boy 
and girl and every teacher in a whole school system ? 
You will pardon me for the deplorable condition which 
makes it necessary to urge upon all officers the close inspec- 
tion of the toilet rooms of boys, and even of girls. There is
-P-A-G-E-90
92 LectuREs oN Scnoon SUPERVISION 
always an evil minded and foul minded quantity in our public 
schools. These are to be expected and are to be dealt with. 
They are contaminating and debasing and the seclusion of the 
toilet rooms is the favored opportunity for display of vulgarity. 
I know of nothing more menacing for pure minded children 
than this utterly dreadful thing of vulgarity on the walls of 
the outhouses of public schools. Every day should the prin- 
cipal or his assistants inspect the premises, and require the 
janitor to obliterate by water or whitewash all vulgar writing 
and obscene pictures. Break this thing up as quickly as pos 
sible. The closest care should be given to the Jength of time 
children are under such influences, and remembering always 
the value of the remark of some wise man who confessed that 
he went to school to a teacher but had his education from 
his companions. 
Finally a parting bit of advice to prinicpals. Avoid the 
dress and style of a teacher. ‘Do not let your assistants or the 
children call you “professor.” Be a man of affairs, with the dress 
and style of a business man of the world, whom business men 
respect. Why should a teacher be eternally draped in black, 
with a long coat and long hair, pale face and sober mien, afraid 
to act like folks and everybody saluting him with the apologetic 
title of “professor.” Be very neat and clean in your dress and 
personal appearance. Shave every morning and be scrupulous 
about your linen, shoes and other evidences of personal clean- 
liness. Dress does not necessarily make but it generally marks 
the gentleman. The assistant teachers deserve the tribute of 
gentlemanly attire and manners that should always be accorded 
to ladies. Be like the rest of the self-respecting, progressive 
world; go to its business meetings, its political meetings, in- 
dulge in its sports and partake of its pleasure. Be a part of

Lecture VIII 
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE 
SCHOOL BUILDINGS 
Ordinarily the public school building is the center of com- 
munity interest. This is particularly true of villages and smali 
towns where there is but one school building for all pupils or 
cne grammar and high school building in the center for the 
larger pupils and one or more primary schools for the smaller 
ones. Such being the case the public school square and building 
should be the very best that the town can afford, a pride and 
ornament to the city. You should always urge and insist that 
the Board and Council build as fine a school as possible, way 
beyond what they think they can afford. If they say a ten 
thousand dollar building shonld do, you must figure on a twenty 
thousand dollar building, for once up and the community likes - 
it, there will be nothing in the building to be ashamed of or 
regret. If you build just any sort of a house, you hardly finish 
it before you are dissatisfied with it, and there it is stuck on the 
community for fifty years, and everybody sorry you did not do 
better while you had a chance. Tt is better to wait a year or 
two until you get the right thing, rather than take anything for 
the present. The best is none too good. I remember in my 
own experience that the board once decided to build a $7,000 
wooden school house in one of our wards. I begged them to 
wait a year and see if they could not accumulate a larger fund.
-P-A-G-E-93
Tux SUPERINTENDENT AND THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS 95 
They waited three years and appropriated $15,000 for a brick 
building of eight rooms. J showed them that eight rooms was 
not enough, and they fianlly ended by building at a cost of 
$30,000 a twelve-room building and now nobody regrets it. In 
fact, there are some who say $5,000 more would have done so 
and so. The public never regrets paying for a good thing of 
which it is proud, and it does not want a poor thing at any 
price. Therefore, build for the future, and strain every point, 
go in debt and do all sorts of ways, to cajole the board or 
people to spread themselves when it comes to an affair that is 
to last fifty years or more. 
The location of a school house is almost as important as the 
house itself. Many a good house is spoiled by crowding on a 
small lot, or crouching on a low lot, or forgotten by hiding on a 
back lot, or made unsightly by standing on a barren, neglected 
lot. A good picture needs a good frame. A good house needs 
to be well set, on a large lot, high wp, with terraces, trees, orna- 
mental shrubs, ete. Then when people pass by they will 
say “That is a beautiful building, What a fine location, and 
how well kept everything looks!” Of course, there should be 
ample space for playgrounds in front and in the rear, but the 
ornamental part of the school grounds should not be forgotten. 
The size of the school building will depend altogether upon 
eireumstanees. It should provide for the development of the 
village or ward, and should look far into the future needs. It 
ie hardly too much to say that a building should be twice as 
large as the present seems to demand, for who can tell what the 
conditions will be twenty-five years ahead? I generally advo- 
cate a twelve-room building with an assembly hall. There 
should be an office for the principal, and another room for the 
teachers, which can also be the library and the reception room. 
By all means have an architect draw the plans and supervise
-P-A-G-E-94
96 Lecrurzs on Scoot SuPERVISION 
the construction of the building. He has an educated eye for - 
taste and beauty and is trained to see that good, honest work is 
done. It is poor economy for any superintendent to be his own 
architect. The building is certain to be ill-proportioned and 
unsightly. The exterior should be as pleasing as possible. 
Simple lines, not much ornament, but in good proportion, giv- 
ing an idea of harmony, durability, simplicity and _ service. 
Avoid towers, steeples, belfries, perishable ornament in terra 
cotta and tin and adhere to that severe but classic taste that has 
Ulustrated that harmony of design is better tbau cheap and 
fading’ ornament. 
Assembly Halls. Every school house should have an Assent 
bly Hall. It is the meeting place for all the pupils in the 
morning devotions where impressive exercises are held and they 
get the idea of the size and dignity of their school. It is the 
dipping together in the general dish before each onc goes to his 
work. These opening exercises should be short, but impressive. 
Perfect order should prevail, a few verses from the Bible read, 
ihe Lord’s Prayer in concert, all standing, then a song, first a 
sacred song, then a school song, then a short one-minute talk 
from the principal, a few announcements; and the pupils file 
out! in perfect order, each to his own room. The time thus oc 
cupied is, of course, taken from books, but there are other and 
better lessons than those we find between the pages. 
Every school should have a piano, and a good one. It is one 
of the necessary adjuncts to a school, as is the library, or the 
heating apparatus. There are hundreds of children who wil! 
never hear any music except what they hear at school, and I 
have scen many stand with open mouth around the piano and 
beg for more because their souls had never been fed with 
harmony. A-piano is a good thing and it should be kept going.
-P-A-G-E-95
Tur SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHoor Buriprnes 97 
Not merely to march in and out by, but to play on for the 
children to hear bright, inspiring music of the better sort but 
not necessarily of the classical sort. The best rainy day 
recreation I know of is for the children to go into the Assembly 
Hall and listen to the piano for ten minutes. They love it and 
should be allowed to enjoy it. Of course, some one or more of 
tho teachers must do the playing. You will have to keep a 
musician in your corps of teachers and she must play for the 
love of it. 
The Assembly Tfall, which has a good stage, with lights 
overhead, comfortable seats, and is generally properly equipped, 
can be used for the following purposes, besides the daily 
opening: 
1, Lectures or Talks to the pupils by citizens or by some 
celebrity who happens to be passing. A school lyceum course 
is among the possibilities. These lectures should not occur too 
often, say once a month. They should not be too long—say 
thirty minutes. They should not be dull, but on bright, inter- 
esting topics. It is not everybody that has the gift of talking 
to children, and the talkers must be selected with care and their 
topics assigned them according to what they know. I recall 
some lectures and topics in a school lyceum course as follows: 
“\ Visit to the Mammoth Cave.” “The Life of a Cow Boy.” 
“All About Guns.” “The Everglades of Florida.” “How a 
Newspaper is Gotten Out.” “The Care of the Eyes.” “What 
We Should Eat.” These lectures were delivered once a month, 
by people who had been there, worked in the trade and were 
able to tell about it, and they were very interesting and profit- 
able, They were asked to talk thirty minutes about that par- 
teular subject to the children,
-P-A-G-E-96

2. Stereopticon Shows for Children. A stercopticon is a 
luxury, I admit, but it is a very helpful and enjoyable means 
of teaching. . If the school owns the stereopticon the slides can 
be rented. In fact, the slides and the lecture can both be 
rented, on all sorts of subjects, historical, geographical, scien- 
tific, animal life, plant life, travels, ete., ete. Nothing is more 
entertaining to- children than pictures and a stereopticon that 
costs $75. is, an, unfailing scuree of interest. and profit. For a 
light you can’ use oil, electricity, acetylene or oxy-hydrogen if 
you care to go to that expense. Any of the school supply com- 
panies will get you the instrument, or you can look up the ad- 
dresses of any dealer of optical instruments, or ask any jeweler 
to give you the names. 
3. Concerts. Then there are concerts, musicales, enter- 
tainments of all sorts for the benefit of the pupils and their 
parents. People like to see their children dressed up and “say- 
ing a piece” on the stage. They do not object to spending 
several dollars for a dress and some ribbons and paying 25 
cents to come in, where they will flatly refuse to buy a 50-cent 
grammar. So foolish are we regarding the way we will spend 
our money.. It is well to interest the people in the school. It 
becomes the center of their life and entertainment and a live 
principal organizes for the education and improvement of the 
people of his commpnity. 
4. Benefit Shows, for the purpose of raising money for the 
library, to buy a piano, or a stereopticon, or pictures for decora- 
tion, or whatever the school most needs. About twice a year 
you can afford to give a pay show, and charge 25 cents for 
grown people and 15 cents for children. The purpose should 
be stated plainly and the results announced, and the expendi- 
tures accounted for in the books, or pictures, or whatever is
-P-A-G-E-97
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHooL Buripines 99 
tought with the proceeds. I know several schools that have 
bought pianos, and furnished themselves, throughout with pie- 
tures by giving a series of cheap shows, or ice.cream: festivals, 
or oyster suppers, in which everybody joined, for the good of 
the cause. : 
Whether the Assembly Hall should be used by the public 
generally for dances, outside entertainments, political meet- 
ings, religious services and things of. that ‘nature remains an 
open question and depends upon local conditions. In large 
cities where there are other halls to be had for the hiring, and 
the chances of abusing the school house are great, T should 
promptly say no. The school hall is for school purposes only, 
and for enterprises undertaken and directed by the school 
authorities. In villages where there are no public halls, and 
the school house is built for that purpose, and the traditions of 
the town run that way, one cannot very well escape a general 
use of the school hall for all sorts of purposes, though I deplore 
the fact, for it cheapens and abuses the hall, makes it dirty and 
common, and vexes the principal who feels responsible for 
whatever happens. . 
School Rooms. Upon no part of the school house should 
more thought be given than to the school room where the pupils 
stay most of the time. After all the school room is the thing, 
and everybody makes way for that. You may as well get a 
school room big enough. If the roll is to be fifty pupils, and 
that seems to be the general average, a room 25x35 is none too 
large, although 25x80 ig considered normal. The ceiling 
saould be thirteen feet high, and the windows so placed as to 
come very near the ceiling for the sake of, ventilation in warm 
Weather when the sash is down from the-top. Rooms may 
be lighted from two sides, the rear and the left of the pupils as 
LIBRARY

100 Lectures on ScHoou Surervision 
they sit. Light from the left side only if abundant is probably 
best. In case of top-story rooms, where windows are located 
badly, a skylight is an admirable substitute. In fact, overhead 
light is even better than side lights, and I cordially commend 
the skylight for those who wish more illumination and that from 
a high source. 
Light should be abundant, but not glaring. ‘Therefore, ample 
space should be provided for light on dark days, but it needs to 
be tempered on very bright days by shades, or blinds, or some 
device that softens and controls the light. Generally a trans- 
‘iucent shade of clive or cream color is sufficient to control the 
light, and ‘give that soft tone to a school that indicates coolness 
and quiet. I dislike a glaring, eye-hurting school room. It 
makes one squint, feel hot and irritated. Enough light, well 
diffused, softened by shades makes one feel pleasant. Strong 
light is analogous to loud tones. One wants quiet in color and 
sound. 
There are all sorts of ways of heating and ventilating a 
school room. Indirect steam heating is best and most expensive. 
I suppose no one nowadays wants to put stoves in a new school 
house, but I can understand why it must be done in some cases. 
My objection to hot water is that careless janitors will leave the 
pipes full of hot water and let the fires die out and a freeze will 
come and break everything. My objection to hot air gravity 
furnaces is that they will not work in some exposed rooms on 
windy days on account of the air pressure occasioned by the 
draught. The best system of heating and ventilating is none 
_ too good for’a modern school. By all means have a care for 
abundance of pure and tempered air. Children cannot work 
or thrive in a vitiated atmosphere. 
Individual desks are the only proper seats for a schoo! room.
-P-A-G-E-99
Tue SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHoon BumpInes 101 
They should be arranged to place the light behind and to the 
left of the pupil. An aisle of thirty inches should be left 
around the room and aisles of eighteen inches will suffice be- 
tween the rows. The desks should be adjustable in height, or 
elsc there should be three sizes in each room, one row for the 
undersized pupils, a number of rows for the normal sized 
pupils, and a row for the over sized pupils. Sometimes an entire 
row is not necessary, but in all cases pupils should be inspected 
and none allowed to swing the feet or bend over in a cramped 
position. The desks should not face an open light. It is toc 
trying on the eves. They should face a good blackboard length, 
over which are placed pictures, a calendar and some other 
room decorations. The blackboards should certainly be made 
of slate which will cost about 20 cents per square foot put up. 
The board should be from two feet to three feet from the floor, 
according to the grade of the pupils and their size. The board 
need not be more than three and one-half feet wide, and should 
have grooved chalk rack at the base. These boards should run 
about fifty linear feet in every room so that about twenty 
pupils could be put to the board at one time. They should be 
washed regularly and sometimes scoured with a brush. If after 
the lapse of eight or ten years they become gray with chalk dust, 
a fine emery paper rubbed over them will restore the surface 
and remove all the chalk from the grain. 
There should be no platform in a school room. What is the 
use of those tall perches, that isolate the teacher; those stairs 
up and down which the teacher ceaselessly climbs? Let every- 
thing be on a level, space is saved, effort is saved, expense is 
saved. There should be tavo chairs, one for the teacher, one for 
the visitor. T never like to stand, nor to sit on. a ‘desk, nor take 
the teacher’s chair. I prefer the comfort of a visitor’s chair 
when I enter a school room. Every teacher is entitled to such
-P-A-G-E-100
102 Lectures on ScHoon SUPERVISION 
articles of comfort as a rig under her feet, a rack for her 
books, a basket for waste paper, a good size lock cabinet to store 
the school material. She does not need a bell, in spite of her 
protests to the contrary; a bell is out of place in a school room, 
and is overworked by the nervous teacher and disregarded by 
the pupils. The best bell is the teacher’s voice. She should 
have the custody of such articles of school use as pens, paper, 
pencils, drawing material, copy books, supplementary reading 
matter, and examination or test blanks. The need of a good 
cabinet to keep these in safely has already been mentioned. 
The pens, pencils, ete., should be marked and numbered so that 
each child should have his own. The unavoidable habit of 
biting pencils makes it dangerous for them to be used promis- 
euously. Matting for the floors is not to be advised for sani-._ 
tary purposes. 
The color of the walls is worth careful consideration and 
should be determined by their exposure. North rooms should 
have a warmer tint than south rooms. Blue should never be 
used. The ceilings should always be wood, painted cream or 
white. A good color for doors, wainscot, and window frames 
is grained oak. A good color for walls is light green, grey or 
cream. A good color for window shades is olive or cream. We 
want harmony in color, with softness and gentle tones that 
sooth without depressing. 
School Room Decoration. It may be safely said that a 
teacher is known by the room she keeps. A disorderly looking | 
house is generally a disorderly house. <A neglected looking 
school room generally indicates a neglected or at least an insuf- 
ficiently taught class. A school room should be a place of 
beauty, pleasing to the eye, attractive to the taste, clean, well- 
kept, showing pride on the part of the teacher, and interesi. on
-P-A-G-E-101
Tne SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHooL BurLprnes 108 
the part of the pupils. Pictures should be suspended on wire 
that is hung by hooks to a pieture molding, This avoids nails 
in the wall, which are always disfiguring, Pictures should be 
cf the better sort, some in color if possible, and all of them 
of good subjects that cultivate the taste of children. Hoffman’s 
“Qhrist Among the Doctors,” Millet’s “Feeding the Birds,” 
Bonheur’s “Horse Fair,” Holmes’ “Can’t You Talk?’ then a 
few bright calendars, one or two simple pictures of landscapes 
or animals, possibly a east of Barye’s Lion (50 cents), a por- 
trait of one or two of our national heroes, and you have enough 
pictures. T would not advise you to crowd the walls with any 
sort of print you can find. A few pictures, well chosen, well ° 
spaced, properly hung, kept level and clean, gives a neater ap- 
pearance than a miscellaneous mass crowded in, advertising 
cards of cigarettes, cheroots, beer, patent medicines and the 
like. No matter how attractive the accompanying picture, I 
should at least obliterate the advertisement features. A few 
mecttoes well made are not amiss, though personally I am not 
mueh in favor of an eternal precept before my eye. I finally 
revolt at its eternal sermon, as I do at a story with an appended 
moral. But perhaps this is personal and mottoes may be all 
right for those who like such things. 
Nothing is more decorative and easier to have than growing 
plants in a school room, vines, flowers, palms, ferns. Every 
window should have an inside ledge or shelf upon which. flower 
pots or window boxes are placed and in which ferns are grow- 
ing. Upon the teacher’s desk should be a vase of flowers, or a 
pot plant. The pupils should be encouraged to bring cut flowers 
to school for the room decoration. Every yard has flowers, and 
the woods are full of them, beginning with the golden rod, the 
autumn leaves, and ending with the wild violets and azaleas, 
honeysuckle and jessamine. Anything will do to put them in,
-P-A-G-E-102
104 Lecrurss on Scuoor Supervision 
though of course regular vases are preferred if you can afford to 
get them. To stimulate an interest in growing things you might 
encourage the pupils to plant seeds in a large box, such as nas- 
turtium, and watch the growth, and care for the flowers. 
A school room should have a supply of necessary maps, 
charts, globes, diagrams and devices of that sort that belong 
to the studies the grade is pursuing. Geography cannot be 
taught without a globe,“and maps of some sort. ‘he teachers 
should be encouraged to make their own maps, either of manilla 
paper, cloth bound, and colored crayon well rubbed in, or on 
blackboard cloth in printed outlines to be filled in as the class 
progresses in the study. Reading charts, number charts, word 
lists, all ean be made by the teacher herself if she is supplied 
with the raw material and given a merchant’s lettering outfit. 
In fact it is well to ask the teachers to make all they can them- 
selves and ask you to buy only that which they cannot make. 
Tt is a good lesson in economy. A clean school room is essen- 
tial, clean floors, clean windows, clean walls, no dust in the 
corners, no dirt anywhere, no paper on the floor, no litter to 
be seen. All is order, arrangement, neatness and the children 
grow up to like that kind of thing, and to be satisfied with no 
other conditions. You see these are lessons not taught from 
books. 
Suitable provisions should be made in every school building 
for the cloaks, the hats, the umbrellas, the lunch baskets of the 
pupils. There should be a cloak room, or hall, with hooks 
numbered to correspond with the seats, each child having a 
hook for his hat and cloak. In these cloak rooms should be 
stands for holding umbrellas, and shelves for holding lunch 
baskets. The room should be ventilated and lighted and kept 
clean.
-P-A-G-E-103
Tre SUPERINTENDENT AND THE Scnoorn BuitprNnes 105 
Every school building should have such conveniences as 
door mats, wire mats, shoe serapers and such things to 
prevent the dirt and mud being brought into the school 
house. If a child has no way to clean his shoes he should not 
be censured for having mud under his desk. This soils the 
floor and keeps the janitor busy cleaning up unnecessarily. 
The front door should have a bell communicating with the jan- 
itor’s room, for the conveninence of visitors, and each room 
should likewise have a bell for calling the janitor. The jani- 
tor himself should be required to wear a white coat and be very 
neat and clean in his appearance. I think that style counts, 
it counts for good impression upon visitors, good influence up- 
on pupils. It indicates attention to detail and shows that 
things are run as they should be. It makes things respected 
by having them respectable. Children respond to their en- 
vironment and are good or bad according to circumstances. 
Water Closets. You will pardon me a word about the just 
necessity for sanitary, well constructed, closely inspected water 
closets. I do not know of a more dangerous or demoralizing 
influence than that which comes to pupils from the ordinary 
conditions of ihe usual outhouse. Here the larger boys con- 
gregate, they indulge in vulgar and profane language, they 
write obscene words and draw obscene pictures on the walls, 
they demoralize each other and corrupt the minds and mouths 
of the smaller pupils. They are practically unsupervised there 
and the teacher is at the merey of their plea of necessity for 
leaving the room. First let the closet be as good as you can 
afford. If painted have the paint sanded to make a rough 
coat that will dull a knife or break a pencil point, or from 
which chalk dust can be swept by a broom, Guard the num- 
ber of pupils out at a time and the length of time each one

is out. Take the boys to themselves and talk to them about 
the evil of such and while you cannot eradicate vulgarity vou 
can mitigate its evil influence. 
School Grounds. In closing I should like to impress upon 
you the value of beautiful school grounds, and assure you that 
it is not only possible but easily practicable to have around 
school grounds the same beautiful flowers and grass that we 
have around other public buildings or around our own private 
dwellings. The school grounds should be ample in size with a 
definite space for the pupils to play in. There should be 
planted a number of quick growing native trees for shade in 
the spring, and some evergreen trees for ornaments all the 
year round. The trees should be planted after the order of 
nature, in clumps and irregularly and not in rows after the ar- 
tificial order of the nursery. The trees should be in the rear 
and to the side of the house mainly, so as to leave the build- 
ing exposed to good view from the front. There should be a 
grassy plot and lawn, definitely set aside for effect, and in 
the corners of the building and along the fences should be 
planted hardy flowers, such as cannas, and the like that will 
give color in early spring. The teachers of the building should 
be divided into committees, and a committee on the yard 
will be one of them, whose definite duty will be to see 
that the yard is kept clean, the walks defined, the flowers 
planted, the trees protected. A handsome school yard is well 
worth while and a little care will bring it all about. You 
need have no fear that the children will disturb the flowers. 
They will be too proud of the effect to be vandals among 
the flower beds. 
I have in mind a school house in one of the suburban wards
-P-A-G-E-105
Tur SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ScHooL BurLpINGs 107 
of my own town where the children were particularly bad and 
destructive. They broke window glass, wrote on the walls, 
stopped up the drains, and were generally a nuisance. The 
school house was an old rented dwelling, fixed up for a school 
house and was not worth having—at least the boys thought - 
so, and they came near tearing it down and carrying it away. 
The time came to build a new school house and everybody 
prophesied evil consequences for a fine building. But we put 
our faith in the boys and we built them a good one—big win- 
dow glass, mosaic floors, white wood work, delicate tinted walls 
and say “now boys you have a good house, what are you go- 
ing to do with it?’ From that day forth there was a change, 
and not a chalk mark, nor a pencil mark, nor a broken glass, 
nor a cut place, has been noticed in the new building. Having 
something to take eare of, they care for it. They deserve the con- 
fidence put in them, and are averse to abusing a Plece of proper- 
ty that should be protected. 
You see there are elevating influences about neat surround- 
ings that have their silent but forceful and persistent lessons. 
So I can end this topic by directing you to the words of the 
report of Twelve on Rual Schools. “If children are daily sur- 
rounded by those influences that elevate them, that make them 
clean and well ordered, that make them love flowers and pic- 
tures and proper decorations, they at last reach that degree 
of culture where nothing else will please them. When they 
grow up and have homes of their own, they must have them 
clean, neat, bright with pictures and fringed with shade trees 
and flowers, for they have been brought up to be happy in no 
other environment.”

Lecture IX 
A WORD TO THE SUPERINTENDENT 
OF RURAL SCHOOLS 
Let us suppose in your ease that you have been selected to 
superintend the schools of your county, mainly through the 
influence of friends and without any great regard for your fit- 
ness or preparation. for the office. It may be you have had no 
experience as a teacher, and many years have passed since you 
saw the inside of a school room. In all probability you were 
elected by political influence, and feel under obligation to those 
who voted for you or worked for your election. It may be 
that your salary is small, not more than a few hundred dollars 
a year, and it is necessary for you to have other business to 
support your family. All this is true, but not to your dis- 
ctedit, nor should it prevent your becoming a good superin- 
tendent and a real live leader in your county, though of course 
you have many things to learn. . 
In the beginning you should lay aside all prejudice against 
the new plans and methods of teaching. Things are different 
from what they were when you were a boy and much better. 
You remember only the good part of your schooling and are 
apt to exaggerate its value seen through the softening medium 
of time. School teaching is better now than it was, and you 
should think so and say so. You will also need all your cour-
-P-A-G-E-108
110 Lecrurss on ScHoon SuPERvVISION 
age to resist the importunity of those who have a grievance, 
or a pet scheme, or a friend or relative to put in the schools, 
and it will be hard to hold to your own sound judgment and 
that with perfect sweetness of temper, but if you are going to 
be the superintendent, and not a figurehead holding office, you 
will need to believe in good schools and plant yourself in the 
way of those who will use them for selfish ends. 
It may be that you have had some experience as a teacher, 
or have already been superintendent for a number of years. 
If so this much is to your advantage. 
Having a Plan. Before entering upon any reforms or 
changes in your schools, you should carefully study the situa- 
tion, and consult with those who know, and make up a plan 
of proceeding that will have a definite end in view. Let it 
be distinctly understood by you what your county needs in 
the way of equipment, how many school houses and where lo- 
cated, and the approximate cost of each. In some places 
schools can be united, in others they cannot. In some places 
houses can be repaired, in others new ones are needed. The 
physical need of your county is the first consideration and 
should be carefully considered, presented to the proper author- 
ities, and plans suggested for its ultimate accomplishment. It 
may take years to work it all out, but at least you have the satis- 
faction of knowing that progress is being made in a well con- 
sidered direction, and that you are not guessing. 
Census Analysis. In order to know where the children are, 
to what building they belong, and what should be the size. of 
each school, it is well to make a complete analysis or digest of 
your schoo] census. As the enumerators go from house to house 
they make a note of the school nearest each child enrolled. When
-P-A-G-E-109
A Worp To HE SUPERINTENDERT OF RuRAL ScHooLs ill 
the returns are made to you, you should have them analyzed 
and all the pupils living near any one school should be sepa- 
rately listed as the roll of that school. This gives you the 
total available of each school and of the entire county, as shown 
by the census. These separate lists of possible pupils should 
be made out in duplicate, one given to the teacher of the school 
and one kept in your office. The teacher then is‘ furnished 
the roll of the school, and it becomes his business to account 
for every name given him as belonging to his area. He may 
report some moved away, some too old to go to school, some 
attending other schools, some refused to attend, and so many 
enrolled. If the system is worked out carefully every child 
in the county is accounted for and the superintendent kuows 
where he stands and what his schools are doing. 
Teacher’s Reports. Jn addition to the above general report 
qade at the end of each term, there should be weekly reports 
made to the superintendent of a statistical nature. A postal 
card system can be devised that gives all the information 
needed at little expense. Those reports should state the num- 
ber of pupils present, and number absent, during each day of 
the week also the total on roll, average daily attendance, and 
such other facts as the superintendent may find valuable. 
These cards should be printed and furnished the teacher at 
the expense of the board, and one should be mailed from each 
teacher to the superintendent at the end of the week. 
The superintendent should keep a book in his office, with 
the name of each school, in which should be recorded the total 
of the weekly enrollment, the average of the daily attendance, 
the. number of pupils available for each of the schools. The 
total of all the schools will show the whole number enrolled, 
the average attending, and from that the percentage of popula-
-P-A-G-E-110
2 Lectures on Scoot SuPERVIStON 
tion enrolled can be ascertained. If this record is kept ac- 
curately for a number of years the superintendent will know 
whether his schools are improving or retrograding and which 
schools are doing well and which are not. Statistics are good 
indications of growth. If the system grows larger year by 
year, it is a good sign of healthy nourishment. If it falls off, 
something is the matter. 
Interesting the Public. It is essential to have the good will 
of the people, and their real interest in the welfare and progress 
of the schools. The public should be taken into your coufi- 
dence, regarding the larger plans for the system, especially 
where they involve money. It is not necessary for you to prate 
every detail of your business on the street corner, or to tell 
your plans before you have fully matured them, or discuss the 
unnecessary incidents of school administration. | Nor should 
any of the confidences of the board, or the teachers be betrayed, 
nor any disagreeable things told. If you are wise you will 
know when to hold your tongue and when to talk. The man 
who can hold his tongue when he should is often the man 
who can talk to some purpose when the time comes. How 
ever, if you want your schools to grow you should know how 
to keep the school idea before the people, without mentioning 
yourself, or taking any eredit, or putting on any airs, or be 
traying any vanity. You speak for the schools, and avoid 
speaking of yourself. Praise the schools as much as you like, 
but let another man praise you. 
The Newspaper goes into every home nowadays, and goes 
daily. People read now and they need information. There- 
fore the daily or weekly press is the largest avenue to the pub- 
lie mind on any topic. Educational subjects are always in
-P-A-G-E-111
A Worp To Tum SUPERINTENDENT or RuraL Scnoors 113 
teresting and the latest ideas in the great educational 
world, the proposed plans for the county systems at large, and 
even for individual schools, and the new enterprises set on foot 
are legitimate items of news. If you can set the people talk- 
ing and get their minds in motion with definite plans and 
propositions, the schools will feel the benefit of the agitation. 
A series of articles by the superintendent, and by prominent 
men of the county, as the general topic “What can be done 
to make our schools the best schools,” will stir the public heart 
more deeply than the ordinary superintendent thinks possible. 
Public Meetings are good devices for interesting the people, 
especially in remote districts where any gathering is a novelty, 
and the neighborhood comes together to “talk it over.” A few 
good speeches by the superintendent, and other leaders, a defi- 
nite preposition for the meeting to discuss, a few ideas in edu- 
cation for them to consider, and they rise at once to the dignity 
of wanting the very best thing. In such meetings the duties 
of parents toward their children and toward the school teacher, 
the relations between the board of education and the people, 
the necessity for better school houses, the advantages of con- 
solidation, the qualifications of a teacher, the new things in ed- 
ueation, and many other topics will infuse energy into the 
people. 
School Entertainments. The value of school entertainments 
a8 a means of interesting the people is an open question. It 
depends upon the people, and the entertainment. An elabo- 
tate exercise delivered to an already enthusiastic community 
is a waste of time. A good exhibit to an indifferent commu- 
nity will help. It is well for the superintendent to. encourage 
such enterprise on the part of the teacher as parents days,
-P-A-G-E-112
114 Lecrurss on Scuoon Supervision 
school work exhibits, mothers classes, and all such teachers de- 
vices as are designed to explain the school work and engage the 
cooperation of the people. ‘ 
New Buildings. The location of a country school should be 
carefully considered. As a general rule it should be on a large 
lot of several acres, a portion of which is heavily wooded for 
shade, near a spring or farm house where water can be obtained 
and upon the highway where passers-by can see it. It should 
be the best house that you can get the people or board to build. 
It should be built for the future, and everybody should strain 
a point to build a house that the community will be proud of 
for years to come. [f it is a one room house, the room should 
be about 25x80 feet to hold forty pupils. The windows should 
be so arranged that the light enters mainly from the sides and 
rear of the room. The long stretch of wall space for black- 
board purpose should be in front of the pupils. There should 
be ample blackboard space, some of which is as low as two feet 
from the floor for the little pupils, and some as high as three 
feet for the larger ones. 
There should be hat hooks in abundance for the boys and 
for the girls, shelves for the lunch baskets, a box for the wood 
and ample cabinet to hold the school material, and also the 
books for the library. The stove may be located anywhere, 
preferably in the center of the room, with the stove pipe going 
straight into the flue. On each side of the stove should be 
placed zine screens to protect the children from the direct heat. 
Under the stove should be a sheet of zinc. If you desire a 
simple device for admitting fresh air, you may have a hole six 
inches square cut in the floor under the stove, controlled by a 
sliding door of zinc. The cold air rises and is warmed by con- 
tact with the stove and is allowed to cireulate through the
-P-A-G-E-113
A Worp To THE SUPERINTENDENT OF Rural ScHoois 115 BS gs eet 
room, finally escaping through a few inches aperture at the top 
of the window. For the purpose of ventilation the windows 
should reach nearly to the ceiling. The house should be neat- 
ly painted inside and out and every care taken to make it a 
comfortable and attractive building. © , 
The School Grounds. The school yard should receive particu- 
lar attention, keeping ever in mind that a well cared for ex- 
terior is a safe index to the probable condition of the interior. 
The teacher should be directed and. assisted to prepare a plan 
for laying off, grading and planting the school grounds, and 
some financial assistance should be given for the purpose. One 
of the duties of the teachers should be to keep good school 
yards, and they should be made to understand so. Unusual 
care should be given to the outhouses, to avoid conspicuous- 
ness, enforce cleanness and decency in their surroundings. 
Provision should be made for an abundant supply of drinking 
water for the pupils. If a spring is near by, it should be 
curbed and cleaned, some seats placed for the pupils, and possi- 
ble a spring house built for comfort and beauty. 
Consolidation. One of the questions before every superin- 
tendent is that of having as few schools as possible in order to 
have better school buildings, larger enrollments, longer school 
terms, better paid teachers and graded schools. Therefore con- 
solidation of schools is a subject for you to think about in your 
general plan for improvement. | Is is estimated that two teach- 
ers in one building can do better than three teachers in separate 
buildings. Sometimes consolidation involves the ‘question of 
transporting children in covered wagons from remote distances 
to the school house. In such cases if the teacher, or one ‘of the 
larger pupils, can be employed as driver, the cost becomes muck 
less, Tt is well to remark that there is no use trying to con-
-P-A-G-E-114
116 Lectures on Scuoor SupERvISION 
solidate schools unless the advantages of such consolidation can 
be proven to the community, and their consent gained to the 
plan. Before announcing that certain schools will be con- 
solidated and before employing a wagon and driver for the 
purpose, a meeting of the people should be held, and the plan 
unfolded before the patrons, and their promise to send the 
pupils secured. Otherwise you had best wait a while. There 
is no community more stubborn, or independent of school mat- 
ters than the average rural community. They will persistent- 
ly refuse their patronage to a school that does not please them, 
regardless of the loss their children are suffering. 
Model School. ‘The best way to improve a school system is 
to begin in one place and fix that as it should be, then go to 
another, until you have gone around. Your pace will depend 
upon yourself as a campaigner, and your friends as a basis of 
supplies. Some superintendents can move faster than others, 
because of their nature or their opportunities. It is well for 
you to have one of your schools as a model or standard schoo! 
for the others to go by. If you cannot at once get a model 
school system, you can at least start with one model school 
house and grounds and teacher. Everything must have a be 
ginning and this is the way to begin. Select a good school m 
a good place, put in it one or two of your best teachers, fix the 
interior and exterior of the building with all comforts, ap- 
pliances and decorations, plant the yard with all the trees, 
shrubs, vines, flowers that are needed, and see that the school 
studies and methods of teaching are as they should be. You 
then have one school fixed to your notion, one standard to 
taeasure by and one pattern to work from. This school could 
be used for the other teachers to visit, to study in and to get 
their ideas from. It serves for an observation school, and if
-P-A-G-E-115
A Worp To. tHE SuPERINTENDENT oF RuRAL ScHooLs 117 
it be of the right sort, and is made conspicuous, every com- 
munity and every teacher will be eager to have one like it, and 
the impetus for the whole system will be great. 
This becomes known as your standard rural school. It is your 
experimental station, in charge of your expert teacher or teach- 
ers. It is the one place that illustrates your ideal of what the 
others should be. It is a place you show visitors, where you. 
work out your new ideas in education, where you inspire the | 
whole force by practical demonstration of what could be. It 
becomes the center about which the community is made to. 
revolve, and the inspiration of the People to declare * ‘we must 
have them all like this.” 
Course of Study. One of the greatest helps to the teachers 
is a well digested, orderly, complete course of study, with full 
directions what to do. In many cases you will not be able to 
select the text-books, since that may be done for you by state — 
wuiformity, or by the board of education, but at any rate no 
cue will interfere with the way in which the texts should be 
used, and in what grades. It is possible that you may be able 
to control the text-books to be used in your schools. In all 
events your teachers need directions what to do with the text- 
books and how to use them. This calls for a course of study, 
which would be printed on heavy paper, in the form of a dia- 
gram, with the grades down one side and the studies at the top, 
the intersecting squares showing which studies belong in the 
separate grades. . 
Teacher’s Manual. Jn addition to the course of study, you 
should prepare for the use of the teachers a small hand-book 
of methods giving a detailed statement of the work of each 
grade on each subject with some directions on methods of teach- 
ing. The manual should contain all the rules of the board for
-P-A-G-E-116
118 Lucrorgs oN Scuoon SUPERVISION 
the conduct of the teacher and the pupils, and many general 
directions or requirements regarding school matters. In fact, 
everything you should like the teacher to know and do should 
be briefly stated in the form of directions. This constitutes the 
teachers’ guide in teaching, in the care of the school room, in 
the control of the pupils, in the care of the school grounds, in 
the matter of reports. You will find that a manual of twenty- 
+ five or thirty pages of some three hundred words to the page or 
more, will be enough for your purpose. This manual should 
be used as the basis for study in the. weekly or monthly meet- 
ings of the teachers, where the rules could be explained, amend- 
ed, improved, added, to or taken from. ‘The manual will be the 
shortest and easiest way to.reach the teachers, for it is a con- 
tinual lecture, always on hand, ready for everybody, and is a 
standard for conduet that is equivalent to a personal letter, and 
better than a lecture. 
2! The Teachers. In the selecting and managing of the teach- 
ers, you will find opportunity for displaying your greatest. skill. 
The real crisis in the school comes when the teacher is chosen, 
for the teacher is the greatest factor for success in the school 
system. <A good superintendent cannot overcome the effect. of 
poor teaching and if he wants his path to be made easy let him 
sea to it that only the best teachers are chosen for his schools. 
As a general thing it is a mistake for the people to choose the 
teacher for their schools. They are liable to get into a quarrel 
over the individual, to select some one living in the community, 
or related to a prominent local family, or some indigent person, 
or some political leader. In any event the school is likely to 
suffer. The board should stand firm by the proposition that 
only the board can employ and dismiss the teachers. 
Be careful about the qualifications of those you employ. A
-P-A-G-E-117
A Worp To THE SUPERINTENDENT oF Rurat ScHOOLs 119 
good education comes first. No teacher can teach unless he 
has the information to start with. Every teacher of the com- 
mon school grades should be at least a high school graduate, 
who has refreshed his knowledge in the common school studies. 
The health ofthe teacher should be perfect. The demands 
of the school room are exacting, sick people are generally 
nervous and irritable, and incapable half the time. It is not 
just to expose children to the caprices and incapacities of those 
whose health does not guarantee steady and efficient work. The 
disposition of a teacher counts for everything else, and this is 
a question of temperament. Those who enter upon the duties 
of the school room, with abounding joy and cheerfulness, ready 
to do anything, go anywhere with great faith in themselves and 
the virtue of their cause, already have won the battle of the 
school. The half-hearted never succeed in anything, and the 
whole-hearted rarely fail. The superintendent should so select 
his teachers as to secure this enterprising spirit that thinks of 
things, and does not wait to be told; that goes farther than his 
crderg would carry him, and who does more than he is paid for, 
and more than is expected of him. What a blessing and what 
a rarity is a teacher who surprises you! 
The Treatment of Teachers. You should be most careful in 
the treatment of the corps of teachers, remembering always that 
there is a cordiality that differs from familiarity, and a criti- 
¢ism that is not a rebuke. So far as your relations with the 
men teachers is concerned you need no advice save to be candid 
in your criticisms, impartial in your judgment and fair in your 
dealings. With the lady teachers ‘you should preserve that re- 
spectful deportment that does not presume upon. your authority 
to be familiar in your conduct or to disregard their feelings. A 
superintendent should neither flatter the teachers nor rebuke
-P-A-G-E-118
120 Lectures on ScHoon SuPERVISION 
them. He should be neither soft nor harsh, but with a cordial 
manner, and in a friendly, helpful spirit, should treat. all alike 
with fairness and propriety. In this way he gains their confi- 
denca and respect, and they are prepared to consider him a 
leader and are willing to do what he says in order to please him. 
Superintendent’s Library. Every superintendent should 
have a library of reference books, catalogued and ready for dis- 
tribution. Each teacher should keep a book on hand, and be 
a constant reader. It is not too much to ask of each teacher to 
study two or three books carefully each school year. Insatiable 
and hasty reading is not the best sort. , The teacher who reads 
carefully, and thoughtfully, is the one who. gets the most from 
te books. If you find that some teachers are not reading any 
books, you should select one from the library and send it to him 
with a note asking him to read it. The list of books in your 
library need not be large. Fifty well-chosen books on peda- 
gogical subjects will probably exhaust the best ones. In addi- 
tion to this it is well to keep for comparison the various text- 
books sent to you for consideration. Teachers need several 
kinds of texts on all subjects, and often get more from consult- 
ing them than from reading pedagogical books. You should 
also encourage the teachers to procure a library of a few good 
books, and a selection of desk copies. 
Teacher’s Meetings. It is sufficient under ordinary condi- 
tions to have monthly meetings for the rural school teachers. 
Those meetings are of great help, being the occasion of social 
meeting of the teachers to exchange ideas and experiences, to 
get acquainted with each other, and to receive from you such 
instruction as you have prepared. You should give much 
thought to the program for such days, using the manual as the 
basis for discussions. Sometimes a prominent educator should
-P-A-G-E-119
A Worn to THe SuPERINTENDENT oF RuRaAL ScHOOLS 121 
be invited to lecture to the class and answer such questions as 
they may choose to put to him. If your model school is in oper- 
ation the meeting should sometimes be held there, to inspect the 
building, apparatus and grounds. Every meeting should be 
different from the others, A committee on program from 
among the teachers will be of aid to you. At any rate you want 
the day to be worth while and thought and preparation on your 
part will make it so. 
Circulating Libraries. One of the most helpful things you 
can do for your schools is to arrange for a series of libraries, 
of fifteen or twenty volumes each, one for each school, to be 
exchanged at stated times, until all the libraries have in suc 
cession been used in each school. Each library should be num- 
bered, the list of books made out and pasted on the box and 
printed directions attached regarding the use and care of the 
volumes. The exchange need not be made but once or twice a 
year, and in this way each school gets the benefit of close con- 
tact with what would otherwise be a remote general library. 
lf you cannot procure libraries for all the schools, you can 
start with one and send it on its rounds, and add others as fast 
a8 you are able. Possibly you can persuade a few of your rich 
friends to subscribe ten dollars for one of the libraries to be 
named after them and started on the circuit. 
The rural population suffer greatly for lack of reading mat- 
ter. They rarely see any magazines or periodicals of any sort. 
Their papers are confined to the agricultural journals that con- 
cern their monotonous life. They want something to relieve the 
tedium of the dreary days and nights when they see no one and 
have nothing to do, Reading is the safest and best occupation 
for leisure hours. Suppose you keep this in mind, and resort 
to all devices to be of service. For instance, a number of fami-
-P-A-G-E-120
122 Lectures oN ScHoou SuPERVISION 
lies of the richer sort will give you regularly all the old maga- 
zines and illustrated papers that have gone out of date, and you 
can keep a supply of them on hand at your office for the teachers 
to get, or you can take them with you on your visits to the 
schools. A magazine for each family in the school will be a 
great pleasure in the long winter nights around the fire. 
A Final Word. After all, the test of :your efficiency as a su- 
perintendent will be in the work you do in the schools and for 
the teachers. ‘To an extent you are a teacher and a leader of 
teachers, and your work counts both for tuition as well as for 
inspiration and encouragement. If your presence be a per- 
petual incentive to something better, if you are cheerful and 
comforting to the discouraged, patient with the earnestly strug- 
gling, ready and resourceful to these who could if they only 
knew how, if you come in like sunshine and make things warm 
and bright and the school-room happier and better for your hav- 
ing been there, you may write yourself down as well on the way 
in your career as a superintendent.

A WORD TO THE SUPERVISED 
/ In order to make the success of a school certain, it is neces- 
sary for all those concerned in it to be in perfect harmony. All 
the parts of the machinery must work together and must fit 
exactly, or there will be friction, which means heat, waste of 
__. energy and probable damage to the product. 
Co-operation Necessary. The superintendent is to be taken 
into account. He is the immediate superior officer of the 
teachers, and his good-will and co-operation are essential to an 
efficient conduct of affairs. He should be taken into consulta- 
tion with all the plans of the teachers, should be asked to help, 
and to bear his share of the labor and responsibility. 
The moral support of the superintendent is a tower of 
strength, especially if he is a wise and strong man. His con- 
sent and co-operation is all the more needed if he is a small 
man, apt to find fault and disagree. A good, strong man can 
help by his positive character. A weak man is apt to hinder by 
his sensitiveness if he is ignored. 
Therefore, take care of the superintendent. If you have good 
plans he will be entiusiastic in seeing they are carried out. If 
the plans are nos practicable and are liable to involve you in 
controversy with the patrons, or an expense that neither you 
nor the people nor the board could afford, his larger experience 
and wisdom will guide you cautiously and advise you safely. 
Tf your plans meet with opposition outside, then his co-opera-
-P-A-G-E-122
124 ‘ Lecrurss on Soxoou Supervision 
tion secured in advance will be something to fall back on and 
he and you will face the opposition together. 
Sometimes it is enough to say that you have talked this mat- 
ter over with the superintendent and you and he have agreed 
upon a certain plan, This will silenca some complaints and 
convince those who are uncertain. At any rate, you feel com- 
fortable that the head of the school is on your side, that your 
plans are not to be turned down, your enterprise rebuked or 
your enthusiasm checked by those who have no right to dictate 
or interfere, 
Especially ig this true in the matter of school management, 
and the measures of your discipline. Country people take 
more notice of the details of their school affairs than city people, 
and every patron knows and seeks to know, the last item of your 
program and plans. They are inclined, therefore, to be critical, 
are strong in their opinions, loyal in their friendships and firm 
in their prejudices. The superintendent knows this, and often 
his best friends and political supporters are among the patrons 
of ‘your school. When they go to him and complain of you, 
your plans of improvement, your discipline, possibly your pun- 
ishment of one of the pupils, the ordinary superintendent lends 
them his ear. He finds it impossible not to agree to some of 
their statements. They get the first word with him and he 
becomes set. Then he comes down to your school, and a con- 
versation ensues that reverses what you proposed to do, dis- 
courages you and probably arouses an antagonism between you 
and him. You see, the superintendent ordinarily depends on 
his friends for the position he holds. The position he holds 
brings him a support for his family. In all likelihood you 
have no political influence, are a stranger in the community, 
and it is a great deal easier to get rid of you than it is to imperil 
cne’s job for your sake. Therefore, it is very wise to see the

superintendent first, ask his advice how to proceed, probably 
iead him along by suggestions, then when a crisis comes in the 
discipline of the school, and a bad boy from an influential 
family is reckoned with, the superintendent is as much in it 
as you are and he feels bound to. explain. 
In most cases, however, the superintendent being a wise man, 
and a friend of both sides, will pursue a policy of conciliation 
that will save everything. He will advise with the parents, in- 
dividually and collectively, and avoid many a catastrophe that 
would have come had he net been called in early. 
If you are an independent teacher, and a good one, you will 
not need to carry many cases to the superintendent for his 
advice. Too many such consultations may impress him with 
your weakness or indecision or inability to govern the school 
he has given you. The superintendent should be advised with 
as a last resort, held in reserve like corporal punishment, when 
all other means have failed. He naturally feels that a teacher 
should not bother him with trifles, that he is to be appealed to 
in great emergencies only. A teacher understanding this will 
know exactly when to resort to the superintendent, but when the 
time comes a full explanation is made, advice is given and 
taken and the superintendent practically takes charge of the 
case, 
Be Loyal. If you expect the superintendent to support you 
mm your plans you must be entirely loyal to him and to all of the 
school system of which you are a part. You should be greatly 
distressed if you should hear that he said some unkind words 
about you to anybody, especially to any of the patrons of your 
schools. You should be as considerate of his feelings and as 
loyal to his administration, as you. would have him be to you 
and your school.
-P-A-G-E-124
126 Lecrures on ScHOoL SuPrERvIsION 
Naturally, the school affairs will be i. nearly every conversa- 
tion that you engage in. You cannot help it, and should not try 
to avoid it. The superintendent comes up in that conversation, 
and you are supposed to know as much about him and his 
ability as anybody, because you are constantly in touch with 
kim. Such being the case, be careful how you talk; willing 
tongues spread and distort unkind things that eager ears attend. 
A forceful superintendent has run counter to many people, and 
they are glad to use your words and opinions as a ram to batter 
him down. The chances are that he will hear of any mean 
speech that you may make about him. This will make you both 
very uncomfortable and your school will suffer. 
If you have anything good to say, mention that. Surely 
every man has some good points, and it is not your place to 
speak of any other sort. If you have nothing good te say, be 
disereetly silent, and avoid the curious enquiry vy changing 
the topic. If you have any real complaint against the super- 
intendent, you should bravely prefer it before the board of edu- 
cation and abide the result. The general public, however, is no 
forum for bitter discussion. They are willing listeners, of 
course, for everybody is more or less curious, and sympathetic, 
but after you have gone they generally look at each other and 
smile. 
Likewise one teacher should not comment upon the work of 
another teacher or school in the same system. That is disloy- 
ality to the superintendent, for he is in charge of the whole. 
Nor should one school interfere with another by soliciting pu- 
pils or taking them when not in good standing at the school 
they attend. It is as important that all the teachers in a school 
system stand together and face the public as one body, as that 
each should have the good will of the superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-125
A Word To THE SUPERVISED . 127 
Obey Orders Cheerfully. Every school system should be 
upon a military basis. The board of education makes certain . 
rules for the superintendent and the schools, the superintendent 
makes other rules within his powers, the teachers make rules 
for the individual schools. Each department has its own pow- 
ers, duties and limitations, and there should be no interfering 
or overlapping of authority. Things tend toward inextrica- 
ble confusion when the board tries to run the schools directly 
and not through the superintendent. . The teacher makes a 
great mistake in appealing to the board for things that belong 
strictly to the province of the superintendent. The superin- 
tendent makes a mistake when he makes rules that the board 
only is authorized to make, or dictates in affairs that belong 
exclusively to the right of the teacher of the school. Each 
should keep to himself and all respect the orders and rights of 
the other. 
When the superintendent receives an order from the board, 
the argument is ended, and the time for silent, prompt and 
cheerful action has arrived. When the teacher gets an order 
from the superintendent there is no more to be said. The de- 
cision is made. The order is issued. The time has come for 
4 prompt, cheerful, willing and full obedience. In such cases 
each should think that the superior officer knows his business, 
_ and that it is the duty of a subordinate to follow orders and 
make no objection. After the council is over, the action 
should be prompt and harmonious. Remember no talking out- 
side, no grumbling, or complaints. That way lies trouble for 
everybody. 
Have no Fears. There is no occasion for a conscientious 
teacher to have any fears of a good superintendent. If both 
are doing their duty, they should work together with mutual
-P-A-G-E-126
128 Lucrures on ScHoot SuPERVISION 
respect and confidence. A teacher should feel at liberty to go 
to the superintendent and talk over the general situation in 
frankness and without fear. He should be accessible at regu- 
lar times, should be agreeable in his manners, kind in his na- 
ture, respectful to those who are his fellow workers. It is not 
wise to linger long after the business is over and waste the time 
of a man who is too polite to betray his anxiety to get at some- 
thing else, but it is equally unwise to stay away from ihat un- 
reasoning dread that some people have of any one who has au- 
thority over them. 
Do not be Sensitive. A feeling akin to fear is sensitiveness. 
Tt renders you very unhappy, since you are watchful of every- 
thing done and every word said, and you are apprehensive of 
neglect or criticism, and suspicious of meaningless actions. 
More than one teacher eats her heart out in suspense and dread 
because the superintendent failed in cordiality, or was not 
pleased with everything he saw, and forthwith pictures to ber- 
self the dire consequences of his wrath or displeasure. Now, 
superintendents have their moods and their bad hours, and 
they are not mad every time they look ugly. It is not fair 
to them for the teacher to be sensitive and suspicious of their 
motives and conducts. It makes the superintendent. nervous, 
and if he be a kind hearted man he will feel bound to say more 
than he wants to say, to keep you from feeling slighted. - This 
in the end will irritate him and he will think it is too mnch 
trouble to keep you in good humor. It is better to be natural 
with yourself and with him. After all he is just a man, for all 
his parading about and looking wise. If 
“Like turbaned Turk, with whiskers curled 
He struts around and scorns the world,” 
just let him. Have no fear of him and do not be sensitive
-P-A-G-E-127
‘ 
A Worp To Tan SurerviseD 129 
about his lack of attention nor greedy to have an excess of it. 
He wants you to be natural, yourself, so that he can be himself, 
and that is best for everybody. One feels sorry for the young 
teacher who tremblingly says to her self, “Great heaven, the 
superintendent is coming; what shall I do, where shall I hide?” 
She goes white to the lips with fear, or crimson with nervous- 
ness, because her best friend is coming to help her, and she 
does not know it. The superintendent also feels fretted at the 
teacher who tells somebody and that somebody tells him, that 
the superintendent “only staid so long in my school, or has not 
been to see me this month, or when he came he looked so ginm 
that I have been worried to death ever since.” That kind of 
fearsome creature tortures herself with shapes that loom up like 
ghosts in the dim path of her future, and frighten her to weak 
and trembling steps, where she should run with exceeding 
gladness and joy. 
Be Discreet. On the other hand, and the reverse, you do not 
need to repeat every nice thing that the superintendent chooses 
to say to you or about your work. If he stayed an hour in 
your school, why should you rush out and tell it to another 
teacher whose school he did not visit at all, especially when 
you embellish it with such extravagances as “Mr. spent 
a whole hour with me to-day, said everything was lovely and 
wished ali children were as good as mine. Of course, he was 
just trying to please me, but really he did say some awfully 
uica things, ete., ete.” This gets back to the superintendent, of 
course, for some one tells him everything, and the next time he 
gives you the formal visit and then you “wonder why Mr. 
is so cross. He hardly said a word to me today.” Your work 
may be ever so fine, and just exactly as it should be, but if you   
 
-P-A-G-E-128
130 Lectures on Scuoon SurEervision 
prate of the compliments you deserve and receive, they must, of 
course, be withheld. 
Do not Object. I suppose there always will be those who 
are inert in every business, who teach for the pay and com- 
plain that it is too small, and promise to do better when the 
pay gets larger. There are those who do not try, who do not 
co-operate, who find objections to every plan proposed, and 
reasons why it should not be, who want to be let alone, who 
cannot be depended on for anything except the most common- 
place performance of as little work as possible to keep their 
position, and who are always saying “Why all this? We are 
doing well enough; what is the use?’ They are the hopeless 
ones—the objectors. They deceive themsclves only, for there 
is nothing in them, and the superintendent knows it, and every- 
body knows it. They are just tolerated, they are driven along 
and nobody really counts on them. 
yo think I know some teachers who seem to have taken a pro- 
ional narcotic; they want to sleep their lives away, and be 
let alone. They are fortunate if they are left to stay where 
they first fell. Their desires are granted, and the superin- 
tendent lets them alone, and they go on sleepily year after year, 
responding to no stimulants, and after awhile they dry up and 
are blown away—and everybody is glad. I know superintend- 
ents, and I have heard many say “Deltver me from the hope- 
less task of making a teacher out of the man or woman who 
meets you always with the query, What is the use?” 
Try. Every superintendent admires a teacher who will try, 
who is co-operative, who pulls with him, who takes readily and 
kindly to new ideas, who can be depended on to undertake 
anything for the welfare of the school-room, the school build- 
ing, or the school system in general. In fact, almost anybody
-P-A-G-E-129
A Worp To THE SUPERVISED 131 
can become a good teacher who will try, who is not afraid of 
work, who is eager for new ideas, who is self-reliant and self- 
helpful. It is true of any occupation, as well as of teaching, 
that success belongs to those who work at it hard enough and 
‘long enough. If a superintendent sees you going ahead on 
your own motion doing things yourself, suggesting things with- 
out waiting, ready to take hold whenever he wants you, putting 
yourself in the general attitude for saying “Here I am, take 
me,” he gets in the habit of relying on you for great effort 
anyhow, and often for great success as well. You are a com- 
fort to him, indeed, and when he wants anything done his 
mind turns toward you. We all love a willing spirit. It is 
the spirit of the thoroughbred, to whom no road is too long and 
no hill too steep. Commend me to one who will try. 
The Teacher’s Rights. You have certain rights that you 
should insist upon, and which the superintendent should be 
made to respect. You have a right to be treated fairly, politely, 
with consideration. You are a co-worker, and not a subordi- 
nate, and are entitled to that quiet, decent, orderly considera- 
tion which your dignity and the importance of your work de- 
mands. Tlie superintendent may not be able to give you 
everything you want or that you ask for, but you are entitl 
to a patient and polite hearing, and a good reason why ma \ 
Under no cireumstances should you receive neglect, rebuke, or 
harsh treatment. You are entitled to the support of the super- 
intendent in your enterprises, and his co-operation in your 
plans for school improvement. Your conferences with him are 
confidential, and you have a just cause for complaint if you 
hear of his talking of you unfairly and imprudently. Like- 
wise should you be treated with that deferential and respectful 
behavior, that avoids familiarity and levity, and does not seek
-P-A-G-E-130
182 Leerurss on Scnoon SuPERVISION 
to compromise you by any manifestations of partiality or ten- 
derness. The superintendent is your official superior, your 
friend and heiper. Anything outside of that, ordinarily, is 
madness and folly. 
Inside in your own room you have rights that should be - 
respected severely. Within your room you are mistress of the 
situation, and under ordinary conditions the superintendent 
has no right to interfere. In such things as the seating of the 
pupils, and the like, the superintendent had best go no further 
than suggest. A good teacher will do better work if she is 
allowed to use her own sense sometimes. Considerable lati- 
tude of judgment should be allowed teachers, and their opinions 
on cases should often be final. If you say a boy ought not to 
be advanced to another grade that ought to settle it, if you are 
not prejudiced. You see, you are not an automaton, galvan- 
ized by the superintendent and not to move except when he 
presses a’ button. You are supposed to be an active, independ- 
ent, capable young weman, teaching forty or fifty children, 
and are not to be interfered with in minor matters, and are to 
be eradited with good intentions, good judgment, and are to be 
helped when you need it, and advised with constantly, and 
there are times when your judgment in matters should be final. 
If everybody is really trying to do right, and be right, and keep 
a sweetness of temper and to help each other along, there is not. 
much chance for things to go wrong. 
The Visits of a Superintendent should be made the occasion 
ot good cheer and brightness to the pupils and to himself. It 
is embarrassing for a superintendent to feel that. the teacher 
is quite upset by his presence, is nervous and anxious about 
the way things look arid the pupils recite, and is counting the 
minutes until he goes. He generally realizes the tension of
-P-A-G-E-131
A Worp ro THE SUPERVISED 133 
the situation and escapes with as much relief as the teacher 
feels when he has gone. Try to be easy and natural when the 
superintendent comes around, shake hands and welcome him 
with a smile, offer him a chair, make no apologies for anything, 
go on with the classes, show him some good work you have 
saved for him to see, exhibit anything especial, that yout pupils 
have done or are doing; incidentally mention your excellent 
pupils, but never your bad ones; suggest pleasantly some things 
you should like to do or have him do, and keep him just as long 
as you can. - 
Do not begin by apologizing for the condition of the room, 
the number of pupils present, or their inability to recite their 
lessons. Do not ask him to take the book and hear the recita- 
tion. Ile will do so himself if he wishes. Do not bring up 
the bad bey, or the stupid boy, or the lazy boy, or the boy who 
‘comes one day out of the week, for a mortifying and painful 
comment. Do not ask the superintendent to make a talk or a 
speech to the school. Te will think of that himself if it is 
worth while. Do not complain of what he has not done for 
you, of the infrequeney of his visits, of their brevity; in fact, 
do not complain at all then. It puts a bad taste in the mouth 
of a visitor who has come several miles and wants a bright hour 
if he can get one. . 
The following is a copy of a letter.a superintendent in Ili- 
nois wrote to his teachers. It is plain’ and to the point: 
“T notice in my visits that some of the teachers do not seer. 
at ease. I do not wish to embarrass you in any way, and as 
some of vou seem at a loss what to do or how to conduct your 
selves during my visits, IT send you’ this circular. There are 
two prime objects to be desired from the visit of a superintend- 
ent to a school. ; :
-P-A-G-E-132
4 134 Lecrures on ScHoon Supervision 
“First—That he may observe the manner and conduct of the 
teacher in her work, study her methods of instruction, dis- 
cipline and government. 
“Second—That he: may instruct, advise and counsel the 
teacher regarding the methods of teaching. If we can work 
together and each do his duty, the schools of this county will 
advance in efficiency, and the result will be shown in the lives 
of the boys and girls entrusted to our care. 
“In order that I may observe you and your work to the best 
advantage when visiting your school, the following suggestions 
are offered : : 
“First—I wish you to go on with the regular order of exer- 
cises. That I may know this, it will be necessary that a copy 
of your program of recitations be before the school. 
“Seeond—I wish to inspect your records, viz.: Daily Regis- 
ter, Term Register, Examination Papers, Report Cards, and 
any other school work you may wish me to examine. Please 
leave these out on your desks that I may inspect them without 
asking for same. 
“Third—Do not ask me to take charge of a class. If I feel 
that I can at any time assist you, I will do so without invita- 
tion. 
“Fourth—Many times I have felt that I could do the pupils 
of-a school good by saying a word to them before going; but 
some teachers never give me an opportunity. 
~~” “Wifth—I expect in the future to keep a record of sugges- 
tions and criticisms which I shall let you inspect, hoping that 
‘they may be an aid to you in your future work. 
“Now I have written you what I wish you to do. I want 
you to write me what I can do when I visit your school to make 
my visit more profitable to you and the school. Feel just az

A Worp To Ta: SupeRVIsED 135 
frea to write me as I have been in writing you, and in so doing, 
we can arrive at a stage of procedure that must. surely result 
in better schools.” 
Make your Wants Known. The superintendent is entitled to 
a full knowledge of the needs of your school. He often needs 
to be reminded several times of real necessity. The teacher 
should not be backward in making demands. It is quite likely 
that the superintendent will not think of these things as soon 
as the teacher will, and the live teacher makes his requisitions,. 
even if some of them are turned down. 
However, a teacher should be wise enough not to ask for 
things he can make himself. Instead of making a demand for 
a five-dollar set of maps, it is more to the point to request 
plenty of good, large paper and some colored chalk, and then 
set to work to make the rest yourself. You show your faith 
by your work. A good superintendent will help them who help 
themselves. As a general rule for the school, it is better to 
make things than to buy them. There are some things, of 
course, that must be bought, such as books, but whatever the 
teacher can do to save money to the school, should be done in 
erder to have more for the things that cannot be made. 
Attend the Teacher’s Meetings. Every school system will 
have teachers’ meetings, monthly or oftener, and these every 
teacher should attend cheerfully and cordially. Do not com- 
plain of the poor meetings, or their lack of interest, but see 
what can be done to make them better and more interesting. 
Throw your whole soul into the teachers’ gatherings, offer your 
services to the superintendent, do not hold back from doing 
Your part of the program, and encourage others to go. 
\Every superintendent appreciates a teacher who stands by 
hit, and who is not afraid of him; who has the good sense to
-P-A-G-E-134
186 Lecrurzs on Scmoon SUPERVISION 
behave with propriety in his presence, who makes reasonable 
, ,tequests only, who is not afraid of work, who welcomes him 
to the school and has something worth seeing, and who enters 
  with cordial spirit into any plan or experiment that may help 
along the eause of education in the community. 
  An ambitious young teacher asked her superintendent to 
spend the morning in her school room, and write to her his im- 
pressions of her work. She was really anxious to. improve and 
was not afraid of criticism, nor him, She did her best, and 
he observed her at work and then wrote her thig letter: 
Dear Miss   
What [ shall say to you by way of comment on your work this morn- 
ing in the school room, must be taken with allowance. I saw only a half 
day’s work, at your special request, and I realize that a few detached 
hours of observation of a teacher who may be nervous or disturbed by the 
presence of a critical observer, is not enough basis for a complete judg- 
ment of her work. 
I have already expressed to you my admiration for the unrestrained 
prodigality of self expenditure that you have shown for your school work. 
In faet, your beautiful spirit of devotion to your punils may imperil the 
length of your service, from physical exhaustion. I should caution you 
against the way that you and many other teachers haye of never relieving 
the tension of teaching, by a moment's rest, or by guiet occupation on the 
part of the pupils, You stand too long, you walk too much, and musi in 
the end affect your teaching ability by weakness. You should sit down 
occasionally, give some work to the pupils that would oceupy them a 
quarter of an hour and give yourself a breathing spell. There are other 
teachers who have this failing, and they find it very trying during the 
warm months. 
A fundamental fault that you may be drifting into is that of teaching 
by the lecture plan, instead of educating by the work plan. One gets the 
idea that you are demonstrating with the help of your class. You are do 
ing too mach of the work, and the class is doing too little. There were 
at least half of your pupils idle today, and two boys who sat in the rear 
of the room did not answer a single question, nor pay any attention at 
all, nor learn one thing while L was there. They wrote four seutences ov
-P-A-G-E-135
A Worp 10 THE SuPERVISED "187 
the slips you distributed and lounged the rest of the time. There were 
fourteen pupils in the rear who practically did not follow you. 
This may mean that the class needs to be divided and recite by see 
tions, or that you should teach from the side wall instead of the end, or 
teach from the rear when you are not needed at the board. You should 
decide what is best, but now, the -fact is that only half of the class is being 
taught. I know that one cannot get all the pupils to attend closely, nor 
do I expect it. but the percentage of inattention should be small. 
I was under the impression that you spent more time on preparing 
the class for recitation than the subject deserved. It is not necessary to 
display the pictures, nor act the words, which you wish to teach. To 
write them on the board rapidly, a few words about each, the pupils copy- 
ing them on their spelling lists, is sufficient. You weary the pupils in 
getting them ready, and when the time comes to read they are already 
tired. There is such a thing as taking so long a run and start that we 
are too tired to jump. Your class was inattentive today because you went 
into unnecessary detail and delayed them from the main purpose, namely 
the reading lesson. Preparation should be over in five minutes and the 
class should get down to its reading. Too long an introduction vexes the 
patience. It is carrying method too far. You lay too much stress upon 
how you are teaching, and appear bound by the mechanism of your well 
studied methods. 
T would suggest to you definitely, 
  1. Shorten the length of your preparation for recitation, and take 
some things for granted. You are not teaching a kindergarten. 
2. When the pupils read. let them read with as few interruptions and 
explanations as possible. They want the story and interruptions too 
lengthily discussed weary them. {It is one of the abominations of the mod- 
ern methods that in teaching veadfig’ a child is not allowed to read with- 
out a vast deal of chaff on the part of the teacher.) You can solve some 
questions by putting yourself in the child's place and dealing with him as 
You would be dealt with. 
3. More pencil and paper work for the pupils, to keep them occupied. 
A child is anxious to be at something, and only what he gets through his 
hands igs really his. The carving of desks, the scribbling on paper, is: 
nothing but the evidence of craving for manual occupation. Keep the 
pupils at hand work in reading, spelling, numbers—by paper slips and 
Pencils, 
  4. Watch the rear of the room. It is a common fact and a significant 
one, that unpromoted pupils sit at the rear of the school room. The best
-P-A-G-E-136
188 Lectures on Scxoon SUPERVISION 
pupils are in front, do all the answering and the rear ones are idle. It 
is true with you as others that your attention is not evenly divided. 
It would be a good device to have the front and the rear change seats 
every day or two for a recitation. The rear of the school needs to be 
in close range. To use a military phrase they seemed “beyond the zone 
of fire,’ your guns did not carry to the back seats. Suppose you try the 
device of revolving the school around the center desks, so that the rear 
shall come directly in front at times. 
Now I have said enough to discourage you I know, but I have been 
honest so far as I could see. I have told you the faults you have, as 
they appear to me after three hours observation of your work, I hope 
you will not Jabor over the suggestions too strenuously. You are inclined 
to overdo your strength in school work anyway and expend your nervous 
force where you should restrain it. No teacher should work too hard. 
I should advise you to give up your Sunday school class, not to do any 
summer school work this year, and avoid Saturday work in the interest 
of your school. If at any time you wish to go away for a while and visit 
other school systems, or study special problems, you may do so. I want 
my teachers to be as free and unbound as possible and I really wish to 
be liberal to them. 
I need not repeat for I have already said, that we are fortunate to have 
you among our corps of teachers. I hope you will be content to work with 
us for many years, and I assure you that I am your very good friend.

Lecture XI 
A SUPERINTENDENT’S ADVICE TO THOSE 
WHO WOULD BE TEACHERS 
IT have been supervising schools for a long time, and I have 
seen many sorts of teachers, and all sorts of teaching. In one 
school I have delighted to linger, and remained with comfort 
and pleasure through many exercises and many lessons. In 
another school I have felt the distress of the situation, have 
suffered all the time I stayed, and have escaped with relief to 
myself and gladness to the teacher. 
What was the matter? It was not with the rooms, for they 
are generally capable of comfort. It was not with the pupils, 
for all children are born alike; it is training that differentiates 
them. The trouble was with the teacher. The one knew how, 
the other did not. One was fitted for it, the other was not. 
Possibly one really cared, the other did not. And so in one 
school there was contentment, in the other there was strife. In 
one was peace, in the other was war. 
Every Child is Entitled to a Chance and a Good One. He tis 
entitled to a good mother and to a good father, and to a good 
teacher. As there are some men and women who are not fit to 
be parents, so there are some people who are not fit to be 
school teachers. It is not in everybody to be a teacher, not 
every one has the teacher’s instinct, nor the teacher’s attitude. 
So those who cannot, ought not to try. Those who care not, 
should not be permitted.
-P-A-G-E-138
140 Lectures on Scnoén SurERvisron 
Let every one aspiring to teach, setile these two questions. 
Is it in me? Do I really care? Let it not be a question of 
necessity for the issues are too momentous. Let it not be the 
ceeupation of the trivial or careless, for there is too much at 
stake, 
The best. teachers are those who begin when young, whose 
dispositions have molded and set about the school, and whose 
natures have adjusted themselves to the demands of the chil- 
dven. 
The Ideal Age to Begin Teaching is Between Twenty and Twen- 
ty-Five Years. There is that in the glow of young manhood, 
and the flush of young womanhood that knows no obstacles, 
before whose enthusiasm all difficulties melt away, in the soft- 
ness of whose nature all inequalities are adjusted, to the 
warmth of whose affections there is an answering glow in the 
heart of childhood. 
Nearly all Amateurs Have the Same Faults. These are to be 
expected and grow out of the strangeness of the work. The 
worst of these is nervousness, which betrays itself in too much 
talking, especially in a loud voice, and in unnatural tones. A 
nervous teacher makes a nervous school. A teacher who lets ga 
of herself, generally lets go of her pupils. In. order to com- 
mand the situation one must ‘be cntirely self-contained, self- 
centered, and regardless of irritations, must never let go. All 
teaching is wearing on the nerves, especially poor teaching, and 
the poorer the teaching the more exhausting it becomes. The 
teacher who is worn out and hoarse at the end of the day, has 
been on too much tension, has strung herself too higb, has 
failed of pose, and that very tension has told on the children, 
and they are affected badly by it. The school room is no place
-P-A-G-E-139
Apvice To THosE wHo wounp BE TEACHERS 141 
foy nervous people. First-conquer your nerves, get yourself in 
hand, be sure of yourself. 
The Profession Misunderstood. Again, I should say that 
many enter the profession not understanding the nature of 
teaching. Teaching consists in leading and directing, Chil- 
dven do not need repression. They need direction. They do 
not come to school to keep still. They come to be taguht, to 
be teld, to be directed. The best teaching is that by which 
every child is occupied, happily and usefully The wise’ teacher 
allows for such noise as is necessary to full mental movement. 
‘The amateur will continually ery “Children, you must keep 
still,’ but after awhile she will learn to say “Children, come 
let us do this.’ Childhood cannot and should not be sup- 
pressed, nor repressed. The teacher who tries it hangs on to 
the safety valve. A school should vent itself in work, in study, 
in ceenpation. Then it is order. And so after awhile the 
order no longer is “Children, shut up,” but it becomes “Chil- 
dren, open up.’ 
Force and Fear in Discipline. Let no teacher try to hold a 
school down by force, or fear, and leave the minds and hands 
unoccupied. It has been tried these thousand years, and it is 
ever a failure. The child mind refuses to be vacant. It will 
fill itself with thoughts, and the hands will fill themselves with 
deeds, if left alone. Allow for no idle time, as you value your 
peace of mind, or value the time of the school. 
Occupation. Now it is naturally impossible in a lecture this 
length to suggest occupation, but you may know that it is worth 
your while to provide yourself with a collection of all sorts of 
interesting things, games, occupations, manual work for your 
school. The time spent in drawing, in cutting, in sewing, in
-P-A-G-E-140
142 Lecrurss on Scuoon SuPErvision 
designing, in knife work, is gained in the occupation, and men- 
tal direction and stimulation of your school. They are at work. 
No child will rest with idle hands, unless 
He be an idiot. No brain is vacant save 
Those to whom the Lord has sent eternal night 
The joyous spring of youth rushes from hands, 
And head and heart. And woe betide the man 
Who seeks to dry the fountain. 
Fearing an overmastering flood. 
Better to let it come, and thank the Eternal 
That boys are as they are; that hands will turn 
To work or mischief; that tongues will speak, 
And restless feet find paths of peace or woe. 
And teacher thou art guide: No sitting down 
In ease for thee. Thy flock will wander far 
And feed at will, and many may be lost, 
Unless thou lead them on, 
“Be Gentle and Keep Your Voice Low.” One of the things 
that all teachers must learn, is that saying of Mr. Hubbard: 
' “Be gentle and keep your voice low.” I am not speaking of 
storming, or threatening, or raving, which is as upsetting to a 
school as it is distracting to a teacher, for no school was ever 
atormed or thrashed into order. I am speaking of the decency 
and propriety of low, quiet voices and a noiseless behaviour 
on the part of the-teacher. I do not. like vociferous oratory. 
It frets my ears, becomes monotonous, wears on my nerves. 
So children do not like vociferous teaching. They love a quict 
teacher, and they respond to quiet manners. The ideal school 
manner is almost a noiseless one. Voice low, movement quict 
and orderly. A good teacher is felt more than she is heard. 
The great men of earth have been quiet men, simple men, but 
they have the noiseless force of the rising sun. Therefore, so 
teach that the end of the day will not find you hoarse, or ex- 
hausted. So teach that the children will not try to keep pace
-P-A-G-E-141

with your own noise. So teach that you will not interfere with 
the good order that might prevail, if you did not set a bad 
example. Remember the tribute of Lear to his beloved daugh- 
ter: “Her voice was ever soft, gentle and low, an excellent 
thing in woman.” 
Patience. A virtue akin to gentleness is patience. Most: 
teachers are impatient of results. We expect to leap to heights 
that were made te climb. At the opening of the year we are 
oppressed with the density and ignorance of the pupils. We 
cannot see how the year’s work ean be accomplished, and we 
fret over the stupidity of the pupils, forgetting that impatience 
and fretting do no good. Then we are surprised to find that 
towards the end of the year the stupid ones are doing very 
well, and the year’s work has been accomplished in spite of our 
fears and apprehensions. (Education is necessarily a slow 
work. A too rapid growth is made at the expense of root 
and stem. ~The sturdiest growth drives the deepest roots, 
is ever slow and discouraging to those who watch. I am nota 
believer in prodigies in the schools. The child who learns too 
easily forgets too easily. Facility is dangerous, for it begets 
carelessness. Nearly all great men have developed slowly. We 
can look our country over and see it dominated by men who 
were the terror and despair of their impatient teachers. 
{Impatience vents itself on the dull or the indifferent and 
the apparently vicious. Therefore, teachers spend themselves 
on the bright and eager, and let the others go. It is so easy to 
do. Now the testing of good teaching is applied to the bad 
boy, the so-called incorrigible. ‘B¥etruly conscientious teacher 
will understand that it is her duty to see that the backward, 
and inert, the unawakened and wnambitious receive her

thoughts, her efforts and her especial care. If there is one boy 
in all the school with whom you should be eternally patient 
and whom you resolve to save at all cost, it is the one you would 
os. auost like to get rid of.~> 
    Incorrigibles. As for incorrigibles, there are none such. All 
vhildren are naturally good. It is training that has made or 
marred them. The parents, direct or remote, the ecompanion- 
ships, or the teaches are at fault. I do not believe there are 
paturally bad boys and girls. I do not believe there are any 
sueh anywhere that cannot be saved. I think sometimes it is 
beyond a teacher’s time and chance to do it, but I know there 
is the making of a good man in every boy. All he needs is a 
chance, and somebody that really cares, 
\. Aniybody ean teach a good boy. It takes a teacher to save 
one that has been misdirected. _ 
Kindness. Therefore, a teacher is ever kind. She does the 
best she can and is good. It does no good to hurt one’s feel- 
ings. You may as well kill a dog as give him a bad name. If 
there is one distressing thing to me it is to go to a school room 
and have some unkind teacher in the presence of the schoo! 
call out the names of those who have displeased her, in order to 
mortify them in my presence. I do not enjoy it. The schoo! 
does not, nor do the reprimanded ones. The teacher is the only 
ene who is pleased. She gets her satisfaction in having morti- 
tied and perhaps hardened some sullen child. J have yet te 
hear that such scenes have ever helped anybody. Such things 
should be done in private. 
A teacher who is kind is at home with her pupils. She feels 
enough interest in them to draw them to her. There is co- 
operation instead of strife, They all pull the same way. There 
is peace because there is understanding and harmony.
-P-A-G-E-143

Let us understand this at the start. No child ever grew 
better or wiser for having been scolded, or abused, or antag- 
onized, or bullied, or beaten. Growth does not come that way. 
Correction may be necessary as pruning is, but we need more 
sunshine than pruning fork. 
Cheerfulness. If there is one characteristic of childhood 
more distinct than another it is cheerfulness. Children are 
not fond of gloom or moroseness. They love a cheerful sur- 
rounding. They seek the sunny places of life. A smile is as 
natural to the face of a child as perfume to the rose. There 
fore, a teacher is cheerful and she keeps her room bright. 
There is a smile of greeting for the morning, a good word for 
everyone. Something pleasant to say, or tell, or read. A 
happy note rings in her gentle tone and she wears a smiling 
fxea all day. No frowns, no knitting of brows, no clouds, no 
rainy weather. It is a note of gladness that we are all here, 
an unelouded face, and unwrinkled brow, and a perfectly 
natural voice, Why should the school-room be a place for 
sternness and long faces? Why change the note of our voice as 
we say “come, children, let us work.” / 
A teacher should be her very best self in the school. She 
should earry there her sunniest and happiest mood, her well 
cared for health, her stored up strength, her complete diges- 
tion. Her teaching should be her song and her praise, and she 
should be glad in her work. Those who are unhappy in the 
school should never enter it as teachers. Let us do the work 
we love to do, if we ever hope to succeed. No one ever yet 
was great in a business to which he did not spring with glad- 
uess, and for which he did not yearn with a great longing. 
Be Fair and Treat all Alike. If you would win the respect 
of your pupils and the support of your patrons be fair and
-P-A-G-E-144
146 LEctuRES on Scooon SuPERVISION 
treat all alike, with justice, moderately administered, and tem- 
pered with mercy. Children are naturally fairaninded and 
resent injustice. Thev are quick to detect and resent favorit- 
ism. They want to be treated all the same, with uniformity 
day by” day, with certainty of reward for work well done and 
with equal certainty of rebuke for work neglected or badly 
done. ~,Thoughtless teachers are prone to be partial in their 
estimates of pupils, loving some because they “cannot. help it,” 
and slighting others because they are not lovable. It is best to 
be fair to them all, not overlooking the faults of the good, or 
the virtues of the bad. 
Nor do I believe in gush on the part of a teacher. A quiet, 
dignified display of interest and affection, a cordial and a veal 
concern for the welfare of the pupils through a sincere and con- 
stant fecling of responsibility for each individual, is better 
than loving intensely the lovable ones, and avoiding as nich 
as possible the unlovable ones. 
Let each day’s work be approached with minds at peace with 
all the pupils, with no prejudices for or against any and with 
a firm resolve to be just and generous, and uniformly and for- 
ever kind. 
Interest. We generally do well in that in which we are 
interested. If we are interested in teaching we will probably 
teach well. If we are interested in learning, we will probably 
study well. If we are interested in what a speaker is saying, 
the hardest bench becomes a cushion. The question is one of 
interest. Of all things deliver me from dullness. A good rule 
fer speaking is to have something worth saying and say it well. 
SA good rule for teaching ts to have something to teach and 
teach it well’That is to say, teach it in an interesting man- 
ner. ee all demoralizing influences, monotony on the part of

_ the teacher is th rst. Children tire very quickly of the 
* same thing repe: They rarely re-read the same lesson with 
interest. The last copy on the page is usually the poorest. In 
fact, anything that degenerates into the mechanical is tiresome 
and uninteresting. The mind should be kept alert for new 
things. It should be constantly on the exertion. 
Work Done Perfectly. In this view of the case, it is never 
wise to have children doing anything perfectly. ‘Perfection 
once attained invites satisfaction. They have arrived, there- 
tove they rest. This satisfaction begets inactivity. It is best 
lo stop just short of excellence and assign other, harder and 
newer tasks, instead of re-reading the old book, that they might 
icarn it better, why not read another book of the same grade 
for the sake of variety? Who wants to read the same book 
twice? This may not make a fine school for display on oc- 
casions but it keeps the mind alert, and that is what we are 
secking for. 
This leads us right to the proposition that the secret of dis- 
cipline in the school is employment. Be industrious, and keep 
your school busy, and the certainty is that you will keep it in 
order. It takes an ingenious teacher to keep all the pupils em- 
ployed, and all the minds fixed, but no other sort succeeds. 
The real trouble is with those who are not reciting and who 
sit idle, restless, noisy, waiting their turn, unless occupied. 
Therefore, if you value the discipline of :your room, leave no 
child nnprovided with work. Be ready and have resources. 
Provide something for the pupils to do all the time. Some- 
thing elastic, that they ean keep on doing, until you are ready 
for them. 
Be Neat and Keep Your Room Clean. Turning to more visi- 
ble and tangible things, let me beg you to be neat and keep
-P-A-G-E-146
148 Lectures on Scnoo. SurERvis1on 
your room clean. Somehow there is born in us a great respect 
for decent things, and we do better when we are surrounded by 
respectable and uplifting influences. A good teacher is known 
by the school-room she keeps. A crown does not make a king, 
but it indicates him. Attire does not make a man, but it gener- 
ally marks him>~So well kept, well decorated, clean. and whole- 
some school may not make a good teacher, but it generally 
indicates one. 
Influence of Environments of School Room. Children sitting 
daily in the influence of well ordered, clean, decent school- 
rooms, abundant of flowers and good pictures, with no waste 
paper to soil the floor, with a happy and beautiful surrounding 
to sink into their lives, will come after a while to tolerate no 
cther sort of thing. The voiceless influence of decent enviren- 
ment, is as potent for growth, as the warmth of the silent sun 
that paints the fields and perfumes the flowers. 
School Teaching is no Easy Matter. Let no one delude limn- 
self with the idea that it is simple and easily done, It requires 
rare combination of powers and eternal effort. ‘fhe ways of 
, to-day may not do to-morrow: The thought of the world is 
fon the next generation, and we, the teachers, are the master 
builders. But we must be studious and keep up. Let no one 
rest his oars, for the work he has done. There is always some- 
thing better beyond. None of us is doing his best. We may be 
doing our utmost, but our best is yet to come. Keep your 
{thought on your work, and not on other things. Consider how 
you may do this or that better, day by day. 
Above all Let us Have Faith in Ourselves, in the righteousness 
‘of our great work, and in the boys and girls of to-day, who will 
be the men and women of to-morrow. Let us not lose heart,
-P-A-G-E-147
Apvice To THOSE WHO WOULD BE TEACHERS 149 
nor be discouraged. But putting our trust in our ability to do 
whatever we really will to do, and what we really care to do, 
let us sow with a liberal hand and a glad heart, knowing that 
time will bring us an abundant harvest.

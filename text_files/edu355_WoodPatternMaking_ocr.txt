PREFACE. 
Ten years ago I gave up my association with a concern manu- 
facturing woodwork to enter the field of education. After two 
years at a normal school I landed my first teaching position. Like 
many others my first experience was obtained in a small com- 
munity. It was a progressive little place and could boast of a few 
manufacturing plants—foundries, pattern shops and knitting mills. 
The school board was desirous of having an industrial department 
that might, so far as possible, serve the community along with the 
needs of the local industries. The available equipment and money 
did not permit us to attempt very much. To accomplish the 
wishes of the board it was necessary for the one instructor to 
teach grade and high school woodwork, pattern making, mechanical 
drawing, and to instruct state continuation school and night school 
classes with their wide varieties of individual problems. I made 
a start, but it was soon evident that with the time left outside of 
school, one man could not plan and furnish satisfactorily all the 
work required to teach these students and keep them busy. I con- 
sulted publishers and was well rewarded with excellent textbooks 
for all of my classes except that in pattern making. True enough, 
I did receive some excellent books on pattern making, but to me 
they only served as reference books. 
In my struggle to keep the class in pattern making busy and 
interested and to furnish them all a well rounded, effective course 
under the conditions and with equipment available, I became more 
and more interested in the work. It became apparent to me that if 
an instructor was to become thoroughly efficient in his profession, 
it was necessary that he specialize. 
In the present text, the instruction and shop work are given on 
a basis of trade units or blocks. In presenting these units to the 
student, it will be necessary for the instructor to carry on numerous 
demonstrations during the period of instruction. The detailed 
work as specified in the text serves as material for these demon- 
strations. If the boy is not led to think and to develop new 
thoughts as he progresses in the work, there is negligence or ineffi- 
ciency on the part of the instructor. In carrying on demonstra- 
tions, it is necessary to keep the student fully interested. Sugges- 
tions as to ways of carrying on new operations, in fact any sug- 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-6
gestion based on the student’s experiences, if they bear on the 
work in question, will help greatly in impressing the instruction 
upon the boy. 
When the student is directed to apply the instruction which he 
has received, shall he repeat the work just completed by the in- 
structor or shall he solve a new problem involving the same prin- 
ciples? The answer must come from the instructor and may de- 
pend on circumstances. It may be suggested that at least a few 
dimensions or even all of them as furnished in the text be changed. 
The drawings are simple and may readily be worked out to a new 
scale by the student in the drafting room, which should be closely 
allied with that of the pattern making. In so doing the operation 
sheets will still be most suggestive, and although of no practical 
value now, the student can check back the operations with the 
drawing as worked out by the instructor in his demonstration. 
Just here the problems of trade practice come in and their suc- 
cessful development will bear largely on the originality and initia- 
tive of the instructor. In each of the simple pattern problems 
which follow one another in the book, a certain principle is taught. 
It does not follow that the method used is the only procedure 
which is available. It is this interweaving of these principles in 
these patterns and all others, that may be used in the shop to 
increase the value of the training from the standpoint of the trade. 
To more clearly bring out the point and to clarify them, some of 
the changes in the pattern construction of the problems in the text 
may be enumerated as follows: 
1. The Building Washer in the text calls for a green sand core. 
Alternate this procedure with a vertical baked core as required in 
the case of the gear blank. 
2. The Gear Blank calls for a baked core. The construction 
may be changed to involve a green sand core and the draft may be 
applied to the hole with a burning iron. 
3. The Bushing is developed as a means of illustrating a hori- 
zontal core. Would it not be policy to cast a small bushing on 
end? Since the dirt floats on top of the metal, should any get into 
the mold, it would then come on the end of the bushing. Secondly, 
should any shrinkage take place it would be on the end and not 
cause a flattened surface on one side of the bushing as would result 
if the mold were not properly made and poured. Owing to the 
6
-P-A-G-E-7
  length of the core it would be necessary to have a tapered core 
print in the cope as noted in the directions. for making a pulley 
(page 113). 
4. The Jack Screw is developed as an opportunity to build up 
a core box. Suppose a concern desires to have the top of the jack 
screw solid and it becomes necessary to support the core at one 
end only, it then will be necessary to work out the problem of a 
balanced core print or tail piece, as developed in a Tool Rest 
Holder. 
5. The Gib is purely given as a problem in loose pieces. The 
same casting may be made by introducing a core into the mold. 
As a correlated problem why not work out the gibbed way, or the 
slide, as such a gib might travel on? 
6. The Bearing is worked out to bring out the principle of the 
“D” core print. This may be done away with and the pattern may 
be made in two parts (split pattern) involving a vertical core. 
Or it may be split to provide for a horizontal core, having the 
bosses as loose pieces. The latter process would not be advisable 
when the other better methods are available for construction. 
7. The Pulley Wheel is offered as a problem in segment work. 
It will serve also as an excellent problem in dry sand molding. If 
this method is used, all parts of the casting are obtained by the 
assembling of numerous cores in the mold. 
8. The Elbow is worked out as an example of pipe patterns. 
Other similar patterns as a pipe “TI”, a return pipe bend, an offset, 
etc., may be worked out. 
In American foundry practice various methods enter into the 
molding of the patterns. Some of the problems in the book, if 
properly made, will serve as excellent tests of a boy’s efficiency as 
a molder. However, it is not the purpose of the text to teach 
foundry work from a trade standpoint, but merely to help drive 
home the principles of Pattern Making. 
The thanks of the author are extended to the several teachers 
who have made valuable criticisms and suggestions for improving 
this second edition of Wood Pattern Making. The thanks of the 
author are also extended to the several manufacturers of wood 
working machinery who have kindly contributed cuts for use in the 
section devoted to wood working machines.

1—WOOD PATTERN MAKING 
Pattern Making dates back to the time when man first poured 
metal as a liquid and made castings for use. 
Before a metal casting is produced it is first necessary to con~ 
struct a form of either wood or metal and of such construction 
that it may be easily withdrawn from sand. The form so 
constructed is known as a Pattern. The man who constructs wood 
patterns is a “Pattern Maker” while the man who finishes up metal 
patterns is known as a “Metal Pattern Maker”. 
During the past few years pattern making has taken a position 
of vast importance among the other trades and industries of the 
country. The reason for this condition may be briefly outlined as 
follows: 
1. The decreasing forest supply which has resulted in the pro- 
duction of many metal products which were formerly made of 
wood. 
2. The vast increase of automobiles and motor trucks. 
3. Improved farm machinery. 
4. The demand for more durable products. 
5. Increasing number of inventions and discoveries. 
As most patterns are made of wood, either for the construction 
of castings or metal patterns, the pattern maker is universally 
understood to be a woodworker. The pattern which he makes 
may be defined as a form by the use of which a mold may be made. 
There are certain facts about the pattern trade for which the 
tradesman may be thankful, among which might be noted the fact 
that the skilled work done by his master hands has not been 
replaced by modern machinery to such an extent as in the case of 
the cabinet-making trade and others. Again, there is less danger 
of the pattern maker being put out of work by the employment of 
women than in any other trade. 
In his work he finds continual interest. Routine and monot- 
cnous, repeated operations are lacking, as he daily and hourly 
works out some new problem with which he is continually meet- 
ing. Every pattern that he undertakes presents a new task different 
from the last, generally presenting or involving some new prob- 
lem as to its construction and method of molding. 
13
-P-A-G-E-14
14 Woop PattERN MAKING 
When a concern finds it necessary to order several patterns 
of one particular kind, only one of the patterns is made of wood. 
The balance are generally made of metal from this original pattern 
through the process of molding. The first pattern which he con- 
structs of wood is known as the “Master Pattern”. The metal 
patterns constructed or molded from the master pattern are made 
of aluminum, brass, white metal, or iron. 
Since most patterns are each an individual problem, most of 
the work is done by hand at the bench, aided by the band saw, 
lathe and other woodworking machinery. 
To become a thoroughly efficient tradesman, the prospective 
apprentice should aim to meet the following requirements: 
1. A thorough understanding of mechanical drawing and the 
ability to read any drawing as well as the man who made it. 
The drawings which come to the pattern maker are generally 
small, that is drawn to scale, and it becomes necessary for the 
pattern maker to lay out in full size, without the assistance of the 
draftsman, each piece that is to be made. In large institutions the 
drawings are worked out in every detail and it only is necessary for 
the pattern maker to work out the patterns. However, in smaller 
shops where the work is not sufficient to employ a designer, the 
ideas to be developed are brought to the pattern maker and it 
becomes his duty then to develop the working drawings as well as 
the patterns. 
2. He should understand all of the allowances required in the 
construction of the various types of patterns. 
3. He should understand the proper construction for the 
various types of patterns. 
4. That the pattern which he constructs may give the molder 
the best service possible, the pattern maker should thoroughly 
understand the art of molding and core making. 
5. He should thoroughly understand the various types of 
woodworking machines and be able to care for them and operate 
them properly. 
6. He should be able to put speed into his work without 
lowering the quality of his patterns. 
7. He should be able to tell after some thought the strongest 
and cheapest methods for building all kinds of patterns. 
8. He should be exact in his work that the patterns will check
-P-A-G-E-15
  MAcHINES AND TooLs 15   
exactly with the blueprints and other data furnished when com- 
pleted. 
9. He should show neatness in his work as well as his person. 
10. He should understand all kinds of woods suitable for 
patterns and be able to select the best stock when required and 
the best methods of gluing up stock to resist warping. 
11. He should have a practical knowledge of the properties of 
metal. 
12. He should have a fair knowledge of mathematics, including 
a number of geometrical problems. 
13. He should have some knowledge of the machinist trade. 
14. He should have confidence in himself. 
2—MACHINES AND TOOLS 
The pattern shop should include such woodworking machines 
as a band saw, a circular saw, a jig saw, a planer, a disk sander, an 
edger, a trimmer and several lathes, including a pattern maker’s 
lathe. Such a lathe is equipped with a threaded spindle at the out- 
side end of the head stock that large face plate work may be turned, 
and the bed of the lathe should be several feet in length to accom- 
modate extra long stock. For details and cuts of machines see 
Pages 171 to 183.

CARE OF THE TOOLS 19     
3—CARE OF THE TOOLS 
Good workmanship is-only accomplished by using sharp tools. 
The tools may be ground on a grindstone or emery wheel. 
The grindstone, as shown 
in Illus. 1, is cut from natural 
stone called “quartz stone”. 
It is aided by the use of 
water which carries off the 
heat and particles of steel 
which would otherwise be- 
come embedded in the stone 
and injure the cutting prop- 
erties of the wheel. The 
grindstone should not be left 
standing in water as it will 
soften and then wear uneven- 
ly. It should run at a speed 
of 550’ to 650’ a minute, or at 
the highest speed at which 
water will not be thrown from 
the wheel. 
The tool should be held 
against the wheel so as to 
form a cutting angle of about 
25 degrees. Tools can only 
be ground accurately by being 
held in one position against 
the wheel during the process 
of grinding. To accomplish this, the tool is held in a holder that 
travels on the grindstone, or by using a tool rest placed in front 
of the wheel. Plate 1 shows a drawing for constructing 
such a‘rest. The cross piece may be moved forward or backward 
until the desired angle is reached. The rest is then locked in 
place. Radiating out from the cutting surface of the wheel on the 
rest, are grooves, the purpose of which is to locate and hold the 
handle of a skew chisel at an angle to the side of the wheel as is 
required to correctly grind the skew or scraping tools. 
  Tilus. 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
20 Woop PatTeRN MAKING   
The greatest care should be exercised in grinding tools on an 
emery wheel as the friction produced from the high rate of speed 
at which the wheel travels is likely to burn the tool before one 
realizes it. The tool should be constantly dipped in cold water. 
Emery wheels vary greatly in their texture and a wheel suited for 
grinding castings cannot be used to advantage in grinding tools. 
  Illus. 2. 
In using the grindstone the tools should be held constantly in 
one position during the process of grinding. If an emery wheel 
stand is lacking in the shop equipment, the wheel may be handled 
on the lathe as shown in the illustration. It is necessary then to 
equip the emery wheel with a tapered spindle corresponding to the 
taper on the live center of the lathe. In this case the bed of the 
lathe may be used as a rest for the hands that hold the tool, moving 
them back and forth along the bed of the lathe as the grinding pro- 
ceeds. Care should be taken when inspecting the tool not to disturb 
the position of the hands on the tool so that it may assume exactly 
the same position when placed back on the wheel. Illus. 2 shows a 
boy grinding a plane blade as described above.

After a grindstone has been 
used for some time it wears 
unevenly under the best of care. 
The stone must then be dressed 
back to shape. The work is ac- 
complished by holding a piece of 
gas pipe against the stone while 
in motion, rotating it from one 
side of the wheel to the other. A 
special tool, consisting of a series 
of corrugated washers is required 
to dress down an emery wheel. 
A tool, when properly ground, 
has a concave surface as shown 
in Fig. 2, Plate 2. A tool poorly 
ground, that is one that has not 
been held steady against the 
wheel, is likely to have a convex 
surface as shown in Fig. 2a, Plate 2. 
  Illus, 38, Combination Grinder. 
After the tool has been properly ground, it is honed on an oil 
stone. There are several grades of stones on the market including 
both natural and artificial. 
An artificial stone having a superior cutting composition is 
known as the India Oil Stone”. The stone is manufactured with 
two cutting surfaces, one side of which is fine and the other coarse. 
Another stone of superior cutting qualities is known as the 
“Carborundum” stone. 
Natural oil stones are known as “Arkansas” and “Washita” 
stones. The Washita stone is coarser in grain and cuts more 
rapidly, but will not produce as keen an edge as the Arkansas 
stone, 
In ‘honing a chisel or plane blade, the tool should be held in 
the hands and a stroke should be taken against the cutting edge 
the full length of the stone. The tool should then be lifted off and 
the same process repeated. In removing the wire edge of the tool, 
care should be taken to keep the straight side of the tool flat on the 
stone. The heel of the tool should be applied to the stone first, 
Fig. 4, Plate 2, and not the edge, shown in Fig. 3, Plate 2.

Inside ground gouges cannot be 
ground on the emery wheel or grind- 
stone. To meet this difficulty an 
emery cone is prepared from hard 
maple as shown in Fig. 5, Plate 2. 
Turn the spindle to correspond to 
the size of the live center, the cone 
forming an angle of about 50 de- 
grees. The outside diameter of the 
cone should be about 1%”. After 
the cone has been turned to shape, 
it is removed from the lathe, coated 
Illus. 4, Top View of a Combination With hot glue and dipped into a box 
Cereer of emery dust. After the glue is 
dry, the process is repeated three or four times. The cone is then 
slipped into the lathe and the gouge is ground on it. Illustrations 
3 and 4 show views of a modern machine which will care for all 
kinds of tool grinding. 
  For honing gouges a slip stone is used. Hold the gouge in the 
left hand, bringing the handle up under the left arm. Into the barrel 
of the gouge drop a little oil and allow it to run down to the bevel 
edge of the gouge, then onto the slip stone. The slip stone is held 
in the right hand and moved back and forth against the bevel. 
Should it be necessary to remove the wire edge from the inside 
of the gouge of an outside ground gouge, the round edge of the 
slip stone is designed for this purpose (Fig. 6, Plate 2). 
4—THE WOOD-TURNING LATHE 
A large amount of pattern construction is accomplished on the 
wood-turning lathe, shown in the illustration. Before attempting 
to do any work on the lathe the student should familiarize himself 
with all the parts of the machine and their relation to each other. 
Jf we refer to Plate 3, we shall find all of the parts as indicated by 
the following numbers: 
1. Cone pulley. 
2. Head stock. 
3. Threaded spindle, for face 
plates and tapered_inside to 
receive live center. 
4. Live center. 1 Tool rest.

wheel. 16. Tail stock binder. 
12. Tail spindle. 17. Lathe bed. 
13. Dead center. 18. Lathe legs. 
14. Tail stock. 
The work is either turned between the centers (No. 4 and No. 
13), termed spindle turning, or it is attached to a face plate (No. 
9) which is screwed on to the threaded spindle (No. 3). This 
latter work is classified as face plate turning. 
The lathe operates as follows: The live center (No. 4) is 
driven by the cone pulley (No. 1) which is belted to another cone 
pulley. This pulley we find in the countershaft which is generally 
situated above the lathe and fastened to the ceiling. In addition 
to the cone pulley, the countershaft consists of two other pulleys, 
one loose and the other tight on the shaft. These loose and tight 
pulleys are operated in turn by one belt over to the line shafting. 
The line shafting generally runs down the center of the shop and is 
connected with and operates all of the countershafts that are dis- 
tributed about the room. The line shaft is sometimes divided 
into units which are connected to one another by a clutch. The 
line shafting is belted to one or more motors or engines of sufficient 
power to drive the entire body of machines in the shop. In putting 
the lathe in motion the belt-is shifted from the loose pulley over to 
the tight pulley. It may be run at different speeds by shifting 
the belt from one step on the pulley to another. 
Before proceeding with any work on the lathe, all movable 
parts should be oiled in places provided for oiling. Occasionally 
the belts should be tightened, but care should be taken never to 
have the belts so tight as to bind the shafting tightly against the 
bearings, which causes them to become hot. 
See Page 176 for the latest word in a speed lathe. 
5—THE SPRUE PIN 
As an elementary exercise in learning to operate the turning 
lathe we will prepare a Sprue Pin for use in the foundry (Plate 4). 
The sprue pin is used to form the sprue hole in a mold through 
which the molten metal is poured. 
The work will be turned between centers and will require a

piece of white pine 114”x1!4"x6%4". Having procured a piece of 
stock as specified, the ends are first centered. This operation is 
accomplished by drawing lines from corner to corner, as “AB” and. . 
“CD, Fig. 1, Plate 5. 
At one end of the stock the lines may be sawed to a depth of 
about 1%” to receive the spurs of the “live center” which drive the 
work in the lathe. 
To place the stock in the lathe, loosen the tail stock binder, . 
(No. 16), (which will allow the tail sto¢k to move to and fro on the 
bed)ofthetathe. Bring the tail stock back far enough so that the 
stock may be driven against the live center with a mallet Hold 
the stock in place against the live center and with the right hand 
bring the tail stock along the bed until the dead center meets the 
other end of the stock at which time the tail stock binder (No. 16) 
is again locked securely in place. The dead center is now brought 
into place by turning the hand wheel (No. 11), taking’ care that the 
center enters at exactly the intersection of lines “AB” and “CD”, 
  Illus. 5. 
Having forced the center in as far as it will go, it is released until 
the work revolves freely in the lathe, a drop of oil is then placed on 
1It is perfectly permissible to remove the center from the lathe and drive it 
into the stock to be turned. In this practice, however, one should take care to use 
a wood mallet and not a hammer as the latter, when hammered on the center, will 
upset the metal; that is, it will sooner or later change the shape of the taper on the 
center and in a very short time will be found to fit poorly in the lathe.

the center and the same locked securely in place by the hand lever 
(No. 10). 
The tool rest (No. 5) is next brought into place close up to the 
work. The top edge of the rest should come down slightly below 
the axis of the work. The rest is fastened in the holder by turning 
the binder (No. 15) and the holder is secured in place by turn- 
ing the binder (No. 7). As the work narrows down in size the rest 
should be continually brought up close to the work.? 
In roughing down the corners of the stock the work should 
revolve at only a moderate speed and the belt should be shifted on 
the cone pulley accordingly. 
The roughing cut is taken with the gouge, the handle of which 
is held firmly in the 
right hand. The tool 
is guided back and 
forth across the work 
with the palm and 
fingers of the left 
hand as shown in 
Illus. 5. 
After the corners 
have been removed 
and the work assum- 
es the shape of a cyl- 
inder (Fig. 2, Plate 
5), it is next sized. 
The sizing of a 
cylinder of wood, as 
shown in Fig. 3, 
Plate 5, is done with 
a sizing tool or part- 
Tilus. 6. ing tool and a pair of 
calipers. 
In using the parting tool for sizing the stock, the calipers are

mall work may be turned at this speed with safety, but as the work increases in 
diameter, say from 3” to 6”, the belt should be shifted on to the next step; work 
over 6” should be driven from the third step of the pulley, and so on. mee the 
process of roughing down the work to a cylinder has been accomplished the speed 
of the work may be increased.

held in the left hand and allowed to ride in the groove being formed 
by the parting tool which is held and operated by the right hand.* 
The tool is easily handled if one will only take time to see that it 
is sharp, and held firmly in the hand, as shown in Illus. 6. As the 
groove is turned to size, the calipers which are riding in the groove 
will slip over, at which time the tool is released and the operation 
repeated again and again until the work resembles that in Fig. 4, 
Plate 5. 
Again the gouge comes into use as before and the stock between 
the grooves is removed, but care must be taken not to go so deep 
as to remove the marks left by the sizing tool. Our stock which 
has now been roughed to size still has a more or less uneven 
surface and it is now necessary to straighten up this surface by 
musing a medium sized skew chisel. In using the skew chisel the 
speed of the work is first increased from that used for roughing. 
The pattern maker handles the skew as a scraping tool and does 
not pare off the work in the skillful way used by the professional 
wood turner. 
The length of the 
sprue pin is next marked 
off on the stock, allowing 
the same amount for trim- 
ming -at each end. Allow- 
ing 14” for trimming at each 
end, the stock ‘is cut to a 
rough length with the part- 
ing tool, as shown in Fig. 
5, Plate 5 (Illus. No, 7). 
The parting tool leaves the 
work rough and torn and it 
is necessary to finish off the 
end of the sprue pin with a 
Diamond Point or a Flat 
Chisel. The stock is re- 
moved in several successive 
thin cuts. The operation is 
8In using a pair of spring calipers a boy will often wonder why his work is 
not to size when he is positive that he has set his calipers very exactly. This may 
be explained by the fact that the friction of the calipers when riding in’ the groove, as the work is in motion, causes the calipers to vibrate and immediately the little 
adjusting wheel starts to turn, and the distance between he jaws of the calipers 
naturally increases. Knowing this it becomes necessary to control the little adjust- 
ing wheel between the fingers, as noted in Illus, 6. 
  Illus. 7.

more or less difficult at the start, but with careful instruction it 
will soon be mastered. 
The pin must still be tapered so that it is now necessary to set 
the calipers to 7” and size the small end, as shown in Fig. 6, Plate 
5. Midway between the ends, the work can be sized to one inch 
and so on, after which the piece is again finished with the gouge 
and skew as noted in turning the cylinder to size, and as shown in 
Fig. 7, Plate 5. 
The work should now be well sanded, removed from the lathe 
ends, cut off and sanded and the pin given about three coats of 
shellac. Fig. 8, Plate 5. 
6—INTRODUCTION TO FOUNDRY WORK. 
Foundry work is the name applied to that branch of engineer- 
ing which deals with the melting of metal and the pouring of it 
into molds by which it is shaped into castings of all descriptions. 
In the manufacture of machinery there are four casting metals, 
each having its individual properties such as durability, lightness, 
strength and toughness, etc. Most castings are made of first, 
grey iron, or second, copper alloys, or third, mild steel or fourth, 
aluminum. Grey iron is chief among these because it can be 
machined directly as it comes from the mold, without further treat- 
ment. There are two other forms of iron, for example, chilled iron 
from which such products as plows and wheels are made and 
malleable iron from which are made such products as builders’ 
sundries, harness trimmings, buckles, hooks, etc. In foundry 
practice there are four branches of work: 1, Green sand molding; 
2, dry sand molding; 3, loam molding; 4, core making. 
Green sand molding is the cheapest and quickest way of mak- 
ing castings. Damp sand is rammed over the pattern in suitable 
boxes, called flasks. After the pattern has been drawn from the 
sand, the iron or metal can be poured immediately while the sand 
is damp. We have various kinds of flasks, large and small, snap 
flasks, etc. 
Core making deals with the different shapes or bodies of sand 
that form cavities or pockets in castings. Such shapes are called 
Cores. Sand for cores may be made of different combinations as 
will be discussed later. After they are-formed they are laid on 
iron plates and baked in an oven until they become hard.

Dry sand molding is the term applied to that branch of molding 
in which a layer of core sand mixture is placed next to the pattern 
and the balance of the mold is filled with ordinary molding sand. 
An iron flask is used and the entire mold is baked in an oven. 
The moisture in the mold is entirely driven off and it becomes 
hard, with no chance for breaking. Such molds are made during 
the day and baked all night. 
Loam work molds are made of brick. The molds are of simple 
construction. Such products as large kettles and propellor blades 
are cast in this way. The work is constructed on large iron plates 
resting on three points so as to have an even bearing at all times. 
A special facing mixture is used and shaped, after which all parts 
are baked giving a clean hard surface. 
7—MOLDING EQUIPMENT 
If the principles of pattern construction, with which the text 
of this book is striving to instruct the boy, are to be made clear 
and impressive as well as interesting, it will be well worth the 
time and trouble to equip the school pattern shop with at least one 
molding outfit. 
A “molding tub” suitable for the pattern shop can easily be con- 
structed as will be seen by studying the working drawing, Plate 6. 
Special care should be taken to guard against warping as the 
material in the bottom of the tub will be in direct contact with 
the damp molding sand at all times. These boards ought to be 
run over the circular saw until numerous saw cuts about one inch 
apart cover the entire inside of the bottom of the tub. The bottom 
boards should be left loose so that the sand may be easily removed 
at any time. The installation of an electric vibrator, which is not 
absolutely necessary, would make the tub complete.* 
A satisfactory tool equipment may be procured at or through 
a local hardware dealer and should include the following: 
Molders shovel. 
14” riddle, 4%” mesh. 12” riddle, %” mesh. These riddles will fit one 
into the other. 
‘Should there be objection to the small amount of sand that will occasionally 
work out of the bottom of the tub when the boards are loose, it is advisable to have 
the entire inside of the tub lined with galvanized sheet iron, 
   
-P-A-G-E-34

One or more 12” snap flasks. 
A few flask jackets. 
A medium sized sprinkling can. 
Two hand rammers, about 234” diameter. 
One pair of bellows. 
A few various molders’ slicks and a trowel. 
A vent wire. (A hat pin will do.) 
A gallon of boiled linseed oil for making cores. 
Several sprue pins as noted in the chapter on “Sprue Pins”. 
A few molding boards, 12”x12”, with cleats on one side. 
A gate cutter. This may be made by cutting a piece of tin, about 2”x3”, 
folding so that the sides become parallel, about 4” apart and round at the 
bottom. 
Order in from a local foundry the following: 
A barrel of molding sand 
A box of parting dust 
A box of parting sand. 
Tf you desire or intend to pour the molds with iron you should 
include a small sack of graphite with the latter order. This should 
be dusted on the mold through a sack as a final step before pour- 
ing the metat, as will be noted later. 
8—INSTRUCTION ON MOLDING A SIMPLE SPLIT 
PATTERN 
Having equipped our shop with a small molding outfit, as noted 
in the preceding chapter, the operations of molding a simple 
pattern will not be hard to master. 
The sand should first be put into a tub and wet down with a 
sprinkling can. It should then be turned over with a shovel and 
again wet down. This process should be repeated until the sand 
becomes damp enough to pack in the palm of the hand. Care 
should be taken not to wet the sand too much. When once in 
good shape it will only need an occasional sprinkling. The molder 
terms this operation of turning over the sand and getting it ready 
for use, “tempering the sand.” g 
Having the sand all ready, the flask should be inspected. If the 
snap flask is to be used, note that the snaps are all securely 
fastened in place, and that the parts of the flask work snugly but 
freely together. If they need adjusting a small set screw will be 
found provided for this operation. 
For ordinary molding we find the flask provided with two parts.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
Motpinc A SrmpcLe Sprit Patrrern 35   
As the mold sets on the floor ready for pouring, the top is called 
the “Cope” and the bottom the “Drag”, or “Nowel”. The two parts 
of the flask can easily be distinguished by their construction. The 
cope, which has to be removed to allow the pattern to be taken from 
the sand, is provided with grooves to hold the sand from slipping 
out. 
To begin with the work, secure a molding board upon which 
place the pattern as shown in Illus. 8. If the pattern is a one-piece 
pattern, determine from its construction which side of the pattern 
must be removed first from the sand. This side of the pattern is 
termed the “Face Side”. 
In commencing the mold- 
ing of the pattern the face 
side is placed down on the 
molding board first. 
If the pattern is of two 
parts, the section without 
the dowel pins is placed 
on the molding board or 
follow board, first as in 
the case of the “Jack 
Screw”, Illus. 8. 
The second operation is to place the drag on the molding board 
with the pins down’, and fill it with riddled sand as shown in Illus. 
9. In performing this operation it is advisable to first cover the 
  Illus, 8. 
  Illus. 9 and 10. 
3 arts of a flask are very accurately guided together. This is 
accomplished “by Placing pins on the drag that operate into openings in the cope. 
In foundry practice they are frequently termed the EYES and EARS. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 Woop PATTERN MAKING   
pattern with sand, sifted through the fine riddle and then finish 
filling the drag, using the other riddle of coarser mesh. 
The molder next secures a pair of hand rammers and with the 
peened end rams down the sand, going around the inside of the 
flask first as shown in Illus. 10. Before he has gone very far with 
the ramming, it-is necessary to again fill up the flask with more 
riddled sand. After the 
inside edge has been well 
rammed, the molder takes 
the butt end and packs 
the center of the mold 
down firmly. The sand 
must not be too hard as 
it will then help to pre- 
vent the gas escaping 
from the mold. However, 
the sand must not be so 
soft that it cannot with- 
stand the pressure of the 
Illus. 11. iron nor to hold together 
in the flask during the operation of removing the top portion of 
the mold. 
  After the sand has been packed, the molder secures a bar of 
sufficient length to 
strike all the sur- 
plus sand down level 
with the flask. 
When the hot iron 
comes in contact 
with the damp sand 
a certain amount of 
gas forms which 
must be carried off 
from the mold, or 
chances are good for 
a spoiled casting and 
Illus. 12. possibly an accident. 
For this reason the mold must be vented. This is accomplished by 
   
-P-A-G-E-37
      Motpine A SIMPLE SPLIT PATTERN 37   
taking a small wire and inserting it at regular intervals all over 
the mold as we see the molder doing in Illus. 11. 
The molder now proceeds to prepare to turn the mold over or, 
as he would technically say, “to roll the flask over.” First he takes 
a small handfull of molding sand and scatters it over the mold, 
after which he places another board with cleats on the bottom, 
which he terms the bottom board as it remains at the bottom of the 
mold from this time on. The board is moved across the mold a few 
times so that the uneven places will pick up the loosely scattered 
sand and give the mold an even bearing all over. He then picks 
up the drag, as shown in Illus. 12, and proceeds to roll it over. 
Remove the molding board, or follow board, which now exposes 
the pattern. If it is a two-part pattern, as illustrated, the second 
part of the pattern is now placed, the parts being located and held 
in position by the dowel pins. (See Illus. 13.) If we would now 
proceed to make the cope, the sand in both parts of the flask would 
stick together. This condition is prevented by coating the top 
surface of the drag with some sand or parting compound contain- 
ing no bond, such as beach sand, sand from a river bed, or burnt 
molding sand, such as comes off the surface of a fresh casting. The 
sand is sprinkled on as shown in Illus. 13, and is called “Parting 
Sand”, 
  Illus. 13. 
Next, place the cope and be sure that the latches at the corners 
are secure. (Illus. 14.) Secondly, note that the latches are on the 
same corner, as it will be almost impossible to remove the flask    
-P-A-G-E-38

later, without injuring the mold, under such conditions. Next 
place the “Sprue Pin” about an inch to one side of the pattern and 
proceed with the 
molding as in the 
drag, or at the begin- 
ning, riddling the 
sand, ramming, level- 
ing off, venting, etc. 
With the fingers 
scoop around the 
sprue pin so as to 
make the hole which 
it forms funnel 
shaped at the top; 
then remove the 
sprue pin. 
Grasp the cope 
firmly by the eyes 
and lift off, as shown 
in Illus. 15, allowing 
it to rest on the mold- 
ing board. The pat- 
tern is next removed 
from the mold. It is 
customary to run a 
Illus, 16, small stream of water 
  Tilus. 15. 
   
-P-A-G-E-39
  Motpinec A SIMPLE SpLit PATTERN 39 
around the pattern first, to make the sand good and firm. This 
operation is termed “swabbing the mold”. The swab generally 
consists of a rubber bulb, or a small bag containing a sponge. The 
bag, or bulb, is tapered to a point at the bottom as an aid in creating 
a very small stream of water. 
The pattern must next be loosened in the mold. To accom- 
‘plish this a spike of suitable size for the work is driven into 
the pattern, rapping it back and forth with a similar spike as shown 
in the Illus. 16.° Having loosened the pattern, it is lifted from the 
mold by the inserted spike, termed the “Draw Spike”, Illus. 16. 
With a split pattern it is now necessary to go to the cope and 
remove the other part of the pattern in a similar manner. 
It is then neces- 
sary to cut a passage 
for the metal from 
the sprue hole to the 
mold. This is termed 
the “Gate” or “Run- 
ner”. This operation 
is accomplished by a 
small piece of tin as 
shown in Illus. 17, 
called a gate cutter. 
In cutting a gate 
Illus. 17. it should be made 
shallow near the 
mold. After the mold has been poured and later shaken out, the 
casting will be found to contain an additional body of metal that 
formed in the gate and sprue hole. This has to be broken off and 
will naturally break in its thinnest section which should be in that 
section which joins the casting proper. 
  The surface of the casting may be improved at this time by 
facing the mold with powdered graphite, dusted on the mold 
through a sack. The graphite does not melt when in contact with 
the hot iron, but it glows red and forms a thin film which seals 
up the pores of the sand and keeps the iron from penetrating. 
The core is next placed in the mold, as shown in Illus. 18. 
*This rapping increases the size of the mold and must be taken into considera- 
tion on very small patterns. It is this condition which necessitates an allowance 
for “SHAKE” as discussed in the chapter on pattern making allowances.
-P-A-G-E-40
40 Woop PATTERN MAKING   
Before placing the cope back, the bottom corner of the sprue 
hole is cut away, the purpose of which is to help catch the dirt that 
may be running with 
the iron into the 
mold.” 
The cope is now 
placed carefully back 
on the drag, the 
latches are unlocked, 
and the entire flask is 
removed from the 
mold, as shown in 
Illus. 19. A jacket is 
then slipped down 
over the mold as a 
support to its wall 
Illus. 18. necessary to resist 
the pressure of the inrushing metal, and as an aid in stopping any 
    Illus. 19. 
‘Every precaution must be taken by all concerned to produce a casting that is 
free of dirt. Before the pot of metal is poured it is skimmed off, and again it is 
skimmed as it is poured into the mold, but with all the care there is danger of 
slag and dirt getting into the mold. In pouring the mold every effort must be 
made to keep the sprue hole filled with metal, the slag being so much lighter than 
the weight of the iron floats on top, and consequently the clean metal will flow from 
the bottom of the sprue hole into the mold. At the start, and sometimes during the 
operation of pouring, the stream of metal will dwindle, allowing the possible dirt 
to reach the bottom of the sprue hole. If the bottom of the hole has been cut away 
the dirt is likely to catch. This may be more readily understood if one will think 
of a stream of water and how the recesses along its banks will generally be filled 
with drifting refuse,

metal that by chance may be leaking out where the two parts of the 
mold join. (See Illus. 20). : 
The mold is then placed on the floor and a weight is placed 
on top of it. Unless weighted down, there is enough pressure 
from the iron in the sprue to raise the cope and allow the metal 
to leak out from the mold.

9—SELECTION OF STOCK FOR PATTERNS 
The greatest care should be taken in the selection of stock for 
patterns. The stock should be well seasoned, that is, left out in 
the open air for several years according to conditions, or thoroughly 
dried in a “Dry Kiln”.* After the stock enters the shop for use, 
it should be carefully stored away to best avoid warping. 
Of all the stock available for patterns, white cork pine is used 
the most extensively, due to its relative cheapness in cost, the 
ease with which it is shaped, and its durability. The material 
should be as free of knots as possible and straight of grain. Under 
these conditions the stock is easily worked to shape. 
Other patterns are made of such woods as mahogany, walnut, 
cherry, baywood, beech, or poplar, which, due to the closeness of the 
grain and the texture, form most durable pieces of work. Maple is 
*When seasoning wood in the open air the pile should be sheltered by a roof. 
The boards should be so pied. that the air may freely circulate between them and 
have access to all parts of the plank. The process of drying is slow and uniform, 
and when thoroughly seasoned the board has about the same amount of moisture as 
that of the atmosphere. In the case of wood that is seasoned in a kiln, the board 
is robbed of its moisture to a degree below that of the outside atmosphere and _con- 
werneatly is in greater danger of warping than that stock which has been dried out 
in the open,

SELECTION OF STOCK 43   
also used in the pattern shop and makes an excellent stock for work 
on the turning lathe. 
In selecting a piece of stock that will best retain its shape and 
warp the least, one should look for a piece of stock that has been 
cut near the center of the tree. This will only be known by study- 
ing the end of the board, where numerous concentric rings will 
be found. Fig. 1, Plate 7, shows a cross section of a tree which 
reveals two distinct features, the concentric rings and a series of 
lines branching out from the center. The rings are called 
“Annular Rings” because one ring is formed each year, while the 
radiating lines are called the “Medullary Rays”. 
After a tree has been cut from the mother earth, it immediately 
begins to throw off from its body the moisture of which it is 
largely composed. As the action takes place, the wood begins to 
shrink. The shrinkage that takes place is always along the 
annular rings and never in the direction of the medullary rays. 
To prove this to yourself, when out in the woods, observe some 
tree trunk that has fallen by the wayside. The wood has dried 
out and shrunk. As the wood shrunk something had to give, the 
result being that the trunk has split open at sections around its 
circumference as shown in Fig. 2, Plate 7. Now select some boards 
from around the shop that have been cut from different parts of the 
tree and note how they have warped. If we would cut down a 
green tree and rip up the trunk into boards, we would probably find 
the following conditions. The piece cut near or at the center of 
the tree would shrink as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, Plate 7. A piece 
cut some distance from the center of the tree would shrink as shown 
in Figs. 5 and 6, Plate 7. As the annular rings shrink the piece 
is drawn to the shape shown in Fig. 6, Plate 7. 
Is it not important then, knowing of these conditions of the 
wood, that one should do all possible to overcome this evil where- 
ever possible? For instance, Fig. 7, Plate 7, shows several pieces 
of stock that have been properly glued together. The grain in 
each piece has been alternated so that as warpage takes place a 
slight wave is effected rather than a serious warp. The high spots 
on the wave may be easily removed and a permanent condition 
produced. 
Likewise, in building up layers of stock, it is advisable to 
alternate the grain as shown in Fig. 8, Plate 7. If conditions per-
-P-A-G-E-44
44 Woop PATTERN MAKING   
mit, it is advisable to run saw cuts down the surface of the board 
before gluing to take up any expansion or shrinkage that might 
take place. 
It is possible to cut a tree into a number of boards in which 
each one has a minimum of shrinkage. Such a method is known 
as “Quarter Sawing” and one method is shown in Fig. 9, Plate 7. 
The log is first cut into four quarters and then each quarter is ripped 
as shown in Fig. 9, Plate 7. The objection to sawing stock in this 
method is the waste which comes in the number of narrow pieces. 
10—GLUE. 
There are several grades of glue available for use in the pattern 
shop. The most satisfactory for use in assembling patterns is 
known as animal glue, sometimes called Cabinet Makers’ glue or 
white glue. Animal glue generally comes in sheets or crushed to a 
powder, as an aid to hasten its preparation for use, and is generally 
of an amber or white color. In preparing such glue for use, it 
should be placed in the glue pot, covered with cold water and 
allowed to stand for several hours or until it turns to a jelly and 
readily melts when heat is applied. Glue should be warmed in a 
double boiler as a protection against overheating and burning. 
If stock is to be glued to the best advantage with hot glue, the 
surfaces should’ first be warmed, either over a flame, or by laying 
them for a few minutes on hot steam pipes. This protects the 
hot glue from chilling the moment that it touches the wood. In 
gluing up the end grain, it should first be coated with a thin coat- 
ing of glue and allowed to stand a few minutes until the pores 
of the wood have been sealed up. This operation is termed 
“Sizing the end grain”. The wood is again coated with hot glue 
and the pieces are clamped together. 
Each time that the glue is reheated it loses some of its adhesive 
qualities. It is therefore advisable to mix at one time only a 
limited supply, preparing a fresh pot of glue every few days. 
Should the boiler, in which the glue pot sets, boil dry unnoticed, 
resulting in the giue burning, it should be thrown out, the pot thor- 
oughly cleaned and a fresh supply mixed. Pattern parts that have 
been glued with this class of glue should stand several hours before 
using. 
Liquid glue is sometimes used on patterns but does not resist
-P-A-G-E-45
\ SHELLAC 45   
the moisture as well as the animal glue. For this reason it is 
2: seldom used except on patterns that are to be used in the foundry 
for a brief period. 
11—SHELLAC. 
Shellac, as it is commonly known in the commercial world, 
is a resinous incrustation formed on the twigs and young branches 
of trees by an insect, known as the Coccus Lacca, which 
infests them. The term “lac” means a hundred thousand and is 
indicative of the countless hosts of insects which make their 
appearance with each succeeding generation. . As the young insects 
form, they attach themselves to the tree and draw their nutriment 
from the sap of the tree. The insects immediately commence to 
cover themselves with the resinous secretion, forming a sort of 
cocoon from which the female insect never escapes. _ 
To obtain the largest amount of resin, it is necessary to gather 
the twigs with their living inhabitants in or near June and Novem- 
ber. The resin is crushed to small fragments and washed in, hot 
water to free it of colored matter. It is then melted, run through 
canvas and spread out in thin layers. This is known as “Shellac” 
Shellac may be bleached by dissolving it in a boiling lye ol 
caustic potash and passing chlorine through the solution till all 
the resin is precipitated__This product is known as. “White ~ 
Shellac”. 
The shellac is prepared for use by dissolving it in alcohol. 
Wood and grain alcohol, in its various forms, may be used to 
dissolve the flake shellac. The alcohol should be 95 per cent pure, 
and one gallon of alcohol will be necessary to dissolve four pounds 
~—“of shellac gum. - White shellac may be made from the bleached gum 
but it dries more slowly and does not produce as hard a surface as 
the orange.shellac. However, the liquid shellac, as it becomes es 
thick from evaporation, should not be diluted with a different form 
of alcohol than was used in the original mixing, as this will cause a 
slow drying shellac. 
~~" After the shellac has been prepared, it should not be kept in 
a metal jar, lest the action of the metal on the shellac discolor it. 
Should the shellac become discolored or muddy from this source 
‘or another, it may be cleared by adding a small amount of “Oxalic 
Acid”/ which comes in crystal form. All cheap shellac substitutes 
    Se a

or copal varnishes should be avoided, as they become flaky and 
scale off, and do not stand the exposure and moisture. 
The brush which is to.be used for shellacing a always be 
left suspended or immersed in the shellac. This may easily be 
taken care of by attaching a small wire hook to aps handle of the | 
brush. Should the brush be left lying across the top of the bottle 
it will immediately dry out and become hard. It can only then 
be used again after letting it soak in a can of alcohol. 
Black shellac may be prepared by adding a small amount of 
jamp black to the liquid shellac. The lamp black which comes in 
various grades can be tested for its quality by rubbing a little 
between the fingers. In a good grade of lamp black grit is missing. 
Red shellac may be prepared by the addition of vermillion. 
(Chinese is the best.) 
Coloring of the Patterns—Color schemes are worked out in 
many of the shops to designate the metal to be used. Although 
many shops have their own color.scheme the following suggestions 
are in general use. for a brass casting the pattern is shellaced in 
its natural color and the core prints are painted red or black. If the 
pattéin is for an iron casting the pattern is_painted black and the 
core prints red or yellow, or the pattern red and the core prints 
black. The inside of the core box which accompanies the pattern 
is also shellaced or varnished black. ‘Core boxes are seldom 
shellaced on the outside in practice. 
All nail holes or any other defects of the pattern should be filled 
with beeswax applied with some warm tool or blade. The wax 
should be applied aiter the first coat of shellac has been applied and 
sandpapered to obtain the best results. 
    Great care and skill are required in the application of shellac. 
Shellac shold be applied to the work in several successive thin 
coats rather than a couple of heavy coats. In the application one 
“should learn to work fast and complete the surface at the time and” 
not necessitate going over the same a few moments later. If one 
does he finds that the shellac has already begun to dry and that 
the new shellac only gums up. The result is a rough and most 
displeasing appearance of a pattern.» Before applying a second coat 
of shellac, the work should be gone over with a sheet of very fine 
sandpaper, or steel wool, only sanding until it feels smooth. The

shellac, although it has apparently dried in an hour or so, does not 
thoroughly dry in less than eight to twelve hours. Should a good 
hard finish be required, the work should stand at least twegty-four 
hours between the coats. Three coats of shellac shoul neces- 
a to give a lasting finish. 
S— 12—PATTERN MAKING ALLOWANCES. 
Before we can undertake the construction of patterns for use 
in the foundry, there are certain allowances which must be made 
on the patterns and which must be thoroughly understood by the 
pattern maker before he can accomplish much of the practical 
work. 
These allowances might be enumerated as follows: 1, Shrink- 
age; 2, Draft; 3, Finish; 4, Shake. 
1. Shrinkage. Most castings, regardless of the metal from 
which they are cast, are smaller than the mold in which they are 
made. This is due to the fact that most metal shrinks from the 
time it is poured as a liquid until it hardens. However, all metals 
do not shrink alike. For instance: Seas 
1. Aluminum shrinks 4%” to the foot. 
2. Brass shrinks 3/16” to the foot. 
3. Iron shrinks 1%” to the foot. 
Again, we have a composition metal often used for making 
metal patterns, known as white metal, in which the shrinkage is so 
slight as to be specified in the thousandths. 
It is of most importance then that, when one undertakes to 
build a pattern, he should first find out from his blue print or other 
data of what metal the casting is to be. Knowing this, and the 
shrinkage of that particular metal, the pattern may be increased in 
size in proportion to the shrinkage of the metal, the result being a 
casting smaller than the pattern but of the size specified on the 
drawing. 
To.compute all‘this shrinkage during the construction of a 
pattern would be an endless and most tedious task. However, 
this difficulty was remedied years ago and today we have for use 
in the pattern shop “Shrinkage Rules” for every amount of shrink- 
age and combination of shrinkages in metals. If a pattern is about 
to be constructed for a casting of iron, one would use a rule stamped 
¥%" shrinkage per foot because iron shrinks 1%” to the foot. The

rule has every appearance of a standard rule, but when the two are 
placed end for end the shrink rule will be found to exceed the 
standard rule by 4%”. Such a comparison of a few of the shrinkage 
rules and a standard rule is shown in Plate 8. 
2. Draft is a taper put on the sides of a pattern that will 
enable it to be easily withdrawn from the sand. The amount of 
taper that should be put on the outside of a pattern is about 14” 
per foot, for every 12” that the pattern stands in height. The 
amount of draft will vary with the style of pattern, but there should 
be enough draft so that the pattern may draw out of the sand easily 
without changing the shape of the pattern too much. If a hole is 
placed in a pattern the amount of draft on these walls is increased 
to 34” per foot.® This is necessary as the small body of sand would 
have a tendency to break off and come with the pattern unless it is 
released from the pattern easily. We distinguish the two types 
of drafts as “inside” and “outside” draft. Plate 9 illustrates a cross . 
section of the building washer which is one of the patterns to be 
built in the immediate instruction to follow. In this cross section 
both types of draft and their application are illustrated. 
FACE SIDE OF PATTERN —~a     2 4 
Plate 9. 
In laying out the size of the pattern the question arises, Shall I 
increase the size of the face of the pattern, or decrease the bottom 
of the pattern and keep the face the required size? 
The latter is assumed to be correct for the following reason. 
Assume a pattern for a block of iron, 12” square. The face of the 
pattern would then be built 12” square and the bottom of the 
pattern 1134” square. The casting, however, would come out 
approximately 12” square as the pressure from the iron in this 
°The statement that inside draft requires a taper of %” per foot is not true 
in all cases. The amount of draft as stated is essential on a very small opening, as 
is the condition of the pattern about to be built by the student. As the size of the 
pattern increases, the amount of taper on the inside walls of the pattern diminishes 
and an average of %” per foot would be nearer a standard, 
Pattern makers, as a rule, prepare a template of various degrees of draft on a 
board. Each taper is marked, and as soon as the pattern maker decides on a draft 
he wishes for a particular surface, it is only necessary to take out his sliding T-bevel 
and set the blade. 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
  
50 Woop PatreRN MAKING   
mold, 12” deep, would be sufficient to press out the sand and to 
increase the size of the mold and the casting. However, it is 
customary for all pattern makers to give and take draft as the case 
may require. 
3. Finish. When castings have to be machined, the surface 
to receive such treatment is noted on the drawing, having been 
designated as such by the draftsman who assumes the responsi- 
bility. Finish should be shown on the drawing by the letter “f” 
placed on the edge view of the surface to be finished. In construct- 
ing the pattern, the pattern maker adds stock to the surfaces on the 
pattern, the amount being from 1/32” to 14”, and even more on 
very large patterns, especially where there is danger of the surface 
warping.’° 
4. Shake. On very small patterns, particularly those less than 
4” in size where great accuracy has to be taken into account, the 
pattern maker has to make an allowance for shake. Before the 
molder removes the pattern from the sand he must rap the pattern 
back and forth in the sand to loosen the same, so that it may be 
easily withdrawn from the mold. This rapping increases the size 
of the mold and consequently of the casting, and has to be com- 
puted in the size of the pattern, if the casting is to be held to 
check with the drawing. The reduction in the size of the pattern 
can only be accurately gained from experience. It sometimes hap- 
pens that two castings are to fit together in the rough. If the 
patterns are made to fit snugly together, the castings will not fit 
and an allowance for shake must be made in such a case. 
In our large productive foundries but few wooden patterns will 
be found in use. In their place will be found metal patterns. Most 
of these are made of aluminum because they are light, easily pre- 
pared, and durable. Other patterns are made of brass, some of 
white metal, and some of iron. 
In most instances a wooden pattern was made in advance. This 
pattern is molded in the sand, a casting is produced, and the 
same machined up and used as a pattern. In such a procedure the 
wooden pattern is designated as the “Master Pattern” and in its 
construction an allowance for “Double Shrinkage” must be made. 
2°Too much stress cannot be given in a short term course of pattern making in the discussion of “FINISH” as one of the pattern making allowances. 
The term is so suggestive of shellac, varnish and sandpaper, that it is no wonder some students will answer when questioned on this allowance that “it is the extra amount added to a pattern to be taken off in sandpapering, ete.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
  PATTERN MAktnGc ALLOWANCES 51   
In other words, from the time the first pattern is made until the 
required casting for commercial use has been cast, two shrinkages 
have taken place. If a metal pattern made of aluminum is con- 
structed for use in a foundry to produce iron castings a 34” Shrink- 
age Rule must be used. For example, the aluminum pattern will 
be 14” per foot smaller than the wooden pattern, while the iron 
casting will be 4g” smaller than the aluminum pattern, or 3@” in all. 
If the pattern is to be machined, as is generally the case, an addi- 
tional amount for finish will have to be made on the pattern, which 
the pattern maker terms “Double Finish”.

13—THE BUILDING WASHER. 
In the construction of large brick buildings, it is customary to 
bolt the interior construction to the outside brick wall. To make 
the head of the bolt more secure, a large metal washer is generally 
employed. These washers, which are usually cast in various 
shapes such as stars, diamonds, squares, etc., are generally made 
of cast iron. The washers are first designed and drawn up by a 
draftsman, blueprints are made and the same are turned over to 
the pattern maker who prepares a pattern for the foundry. 
The pattern maker studies the print with the following in view: 
1. Are there any projections on the pattern to give the molder 
any annoyance? If so, make adjustments to simplify work in the 
foundry. 
2. The best and cheapest methods to construct the pattern. 
This decision would be based on whether or not the pattern would 
be used but once or for an indefinite period. 
3. The best woods suited for the pattern. 
4. The kind of metal wanted for the casting. 
Plate 10 shows a working drawing for such a washer for which 
we shall prepare a pattern. ; 
A study of the drawing reveals a simple form, the only part 
which could cause the molder any trouble being a square one inch 
hole, central on the pattern. As the pattern is only to be used in 
the rough, a slight taper on the walls of the hole will not make 
any material difference, and the pattern will then afford the molder 
every advantage that he could wish for. 
Since the casting is to be made of iron which shrinks 1%” to the 
foot, a 4%” shrink rule will be required in laying out the work. 
To proceed with the pattern secure a piece of white pine and 
square it to 4” as noted in Fig. 1, Plate 11. Since we are using 
a shrinkage rule, the piece will be actually a shade over 4” when 
measured with a standard rule. In squaring up a piece of the 
stock proceed as follows: 
53
-P-A-G-E-54

-P-A-G-E-55
  
  Tue BuiLptnc WASHER 55   
1. Square up a face side. Mark this side with a couple of 
witness marks. 
2. Square up an edge and mark same. 
3. Square up an end and mark as before. 
Note.—In laying out the balance of the work, it should be done 
from these three sides which have been marked. If this is done, 
they will not be confused with the balance of the surfaces. 
4. Measure for length and square off a knife line at the other 
end of the block. Square the work with a plane to the knife line. 
Note.—If the surface formed by the knife is not removed in 
planing, but the wood is removed to this surface which can very 
readily be seen, the end will or should test out perfectly square. 
The knife edge is in this case a salvation to the boy who always 
finds it impossible to square up the end of a block. 
5. Gauge for width and square up the opposite edge. 
6. Gauge for thickness and square up the opposite side. 
Having squared up the block, proceed to lay out the 1” square 
for the hole. Before proceeding to lay out the, hole it will be 
necessary to compute the size of the hole at each end to give the 
walls inside the proper amount of “draft”. Review “allowance on 
draft” and you will note that for inside draft 34” to the foot is 
required, or a taper of 1/16” to every inch. Our block, being 
approximately one inch thick, would require a taper of 1/16” on 
each side or a difference of 14” in the size of the two ends of the 
hole. A one inch hole being specified, we shall construct the hole 
in the pattern so that it is 15/16” at one end and 1-1/16” at the 
other end. In laying out the hole it will first be necessary to 
construct two sets of center lines around the block, as shown in 
Fig. 2. In this operation we should learn that center lines running 
with the grain of the wood are made with a marking gauge, while 
those crossing the grain are made with a knife and a square. 
Having accomplished this, secure a compass, and at the intersection 
of the center lines on both sides of the block construct a circle. 
One of them will be 15/16” in diameter, and the other one will be 
1-1/16”. Next secure a miter square or a protractor set at 45 
degrees and construct a square on both sides of the block, using a 
sharp knife and being sure that the lines just touch the circles and 
cross each other on the center lines, as shown in Fig. 3. 
The laying out of the pattern should be done with a knife for 
several reasons, namely: Accuracy, and as a protection against
-P-A-G-E-56
56 Woop PatrerN MAKING 
surface splitting in boring the hole and likewise in chiseling. 
Again all construction lines must remain on the finished pattern 
and will not be removed when the pattern is finally sandpapered. 
Other reasons will be noted in the instruction. The piece is now 
placed in the bench vise as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 11. This will 
protect the piece from splitting when boring the hole. The bulk 
of the stock can be removed with a 34” bit, which is a No. 12, (the 
number on the bit corresponding to the number of sixteenths in 
the fraction or size of bit wanted). In boring the hole the work 
should be turned around as the spur of the bit penetrates through 
the piece, or the back surface will split. Should an accident hap- 
pen the knife lines will act as a protection. 
The block is removed from the vise, placed on a scrap 
piece, and the walls of the square hole are chiseled out as shown in 
Fig. 5, Plate 11. It is advisable to cut in one direction only, as 
operating from both sides will tend to form a ridge that will 
seriously interfere with the molding of the pattern. The easiest 
method is to cut from the large end of the hole down to the small 
end. 
  Front Back 
Illus. 21. 
Having finished operations on the hole, the work is laid out for 
the bevel which comes in one inch from the edge and tapers 
down to the center of the edge. The construction lines should be 
made as noted in the case of the center lines; that is, using the 
marking gauge for the lines running with the grain, and the knife 
and square for the lines running across the grain, as the case may 
require. Place the piece in a vise, as shown in Fig. 6, Plate 11, 
and plane down to the construction lines. Work the surface 
across the grain first, and the two sides running with the grain 
last. Fold a piece of sandpaper around a small sanding block and 
proceed to sand up all of the surfaces of the pattern. The pattern,

when completed, will appear as shown in Illus. 21. Note the con- 
struction lines. These lines should all remain on the finished pattern 
so that the person who now makes a business of checking the 
finished work, has some means of checking your layout. 
Finish the pattern with three coats of shellac, sanding between 
each coat with 00 sandpaper, or steel wool. 
See that your name, date and class appear on the back of the 
pattern.   
14—CORES AND CORE PRINTS 
When hollow castings are wanted, or castings with holes 
through them, a core must be introduced into the mold. The core 
may be formed by the pattern itself, or shaped in a box and placed 
in the mold after the pattern has been withdrawn from the sand. 
Any projection of sand into the mold, regardless of size or shape, 
is known as a core. 
Illus. 22 shows the mold as formed from the pattern of the 
pulley wheel which is discussed later in the instruction. Central 
in the mold are four projections of sand that form the spokes. 
  Illus. 22. 
Projecting into the mold, as they do, they must be termed cores. 
These cores were formed by the pattern itself and are known as 
“Green Sand Cores”. 
All patterns are not of such construction that they can form 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 Woop PATTERN MAKING   
their own cores as in the case of the “Jack Screw” which we dis- 
cussed in the operations of molding earlier in the book. In this 
case it is necessary to make a core in a core box, later placing 
it in the mold. Illus. 23 shows another mold in which a baked 
core has been introduced into the mold. The casting is to be a 
hose connection for a tank car. Note the core box, the partial 
cores, and the completed core in the mold. Also the provision 
made on the pattern to support the core in the mold. In order 
  Tlus. 28. 
that such a core may be supported in the mold, special recesses 
have to be formed in the sand upon which the core may rest. 
These recesses are formed by projections on the pattern, and these 
projections on the pattern are known as “Core Prints”. One can 
readily distinguish the core prints from the rest of the pattern by 
the color scheme. If the pattern is coated with orange shellac it is 
customary to coat the prints with red or black shellac, etc., as noted

Since the core rests in the space made by the core print and 
completely fills the space, no metal is given a chance to enter, and 
hence, when the casting is formed, all projections painted on the

pattern as core prints are not found on the casting and at their 
location an opening into the casting has been formed. When the 
casting is first exposed it is found to still contain the core sand. 
This is now readily shaken out as the bond which held the core 
sand together has lost its life, having been burned out by the heat 
of the iron. 
15—MIXING, SHAPING AND BAKING OF CORES 
There are several things to be considered in the making and 
baking of the cores, such as: 
1. Various mixtures of sand. 
2. Reinforcement of core. 
3. Venting. 
4. Baking. 
1. Mixtures of Core Sand. In mixing the sand for a baked 
core, some material that will bind the sand together must be used, 
and this must be of such composition that the bond will loosen 
after the hot iron has been poured into the mold so that the sand 
may be shaken from the casting. For making cores, beach or 
tiver-bed sand is used. The sand is passed through a very fine 
riddle and cleared of stones and other substances. Several bind- 
ing materials are used—raw linseed oil, thin glue water, rosin, 
flour and water, etc. The binding material is worked into the sand 
until the sand is damp enough to hold together after it has been 
shaped in’a core box.? The sand is packed into the box, struck 
off, and the box is quickly turned over onto an iron plate, should the 
type of core box in use demand this, as is the case in the bushing, 
Fig. 14, Plate 16.1% It is then tapped lightly from all sides to loosen 
the core. The box is then lifted steadily’* until the core is released 
All dry ingredients used in the core must first be thoroughly mixed and 
sifted while dry. The sand should be tempered a little damper than molding sand. 
If the sand is too wet, it will adhere to the surface of the core box, while if too dry 
it is harder to shape and readily crumbles after baking. 
For additional information on core mixtures consult any good reference on 
foundry work. 
1sWhen the core box is of the type as shown in connection with the gear blank, 
Fig. 5, Plate 13, it is only necessary to place the box on the core plate, fill the 
opening with core sand, vent, and then part the box when the core is ready for 
baking. 
MGreat care is required in the lifting of the box. Should it shift side-ways 
before the core is entirely freed, chances are some surface will be damaged. 
Many core boxes are symmetrical inside as is the case in the bushing, Fig. 14, 
Plate 16. Such a box may be removed without any injury to the core by keeping 
the front edge or corner firm on the plate, using it as the pin when raising the box 
as you would open a hinge.

and left lying on the iron plate, at which time the core maker again 
repeats the operation and makes another core. If the core has a 
straight edge, such as is used in the bushing to follow, the core 
maker, upon lifting the box from the core, proceeds to push the core 
up close to the last one that he made, using the outside edge of the 
box as a means of pushing the core along the plate. At the same 
time the edge of the box leaves the core perfectly straight. Illus. 
24 shows a boy in the act of making a plateful of cores for a hose 
connection. 
  Illus. 24, 
2. Reinforcing a Core. If the core is delicate, or likely to 
break in the handling or from the action of the metal in the mold, 
it must be reinforced by introducing wires or iron rods and some- 
times nails and screws into the sand before baking. The rein- 
forcement is placed in a suitable place in the sand at the time it 
is packed in the box. After baking, the core is firm and strong. 
All cores cannot be placed directly on a flat plate for baking 
owing to their construction. In such a case an additional support 
has to be placed between the elevated part, or under the surface of 
  js il irae

  Mrxinc, SHAPING AND BAKING CorEs 61   
the core and the plate. Should such a core be made on a produc- 
tion basis, a metal form to support that particular core is made and 
is known in the foundry as a “Drier”. When the production does 
not warrant the making of a drier, then the core may be supported 
on a bed of damp sand. This sand is tempered with water, and as 
  Tilus. 25. 
the baking of the core takes place, the bed dries out and crumbles 
away from the core. A gas engine water jacket is a good example 
of such a type of core. 
3. Venting a Core. The materials used as binders in cores 
will form more or less gas when in contact with the hot metal.
-P-A-G-E-62

-P-A-G-E-63
THE GEAR BLANK 63 
This gas must be carried out of the mold as directly and carefully 
as possible, and like the mold the core also must be vented. If the 
core is small the sand may be vented while being shaped in the 
box with a vent-wire, noting that the lead given the gas passes 
onto the molding sand and not the metal.!® If the core is large, wax 
.strips are placed in the sand at the time the sand is placed in the 
core box, and as the core is being baked the wax melts and flows 
out, or is absorbed in the sand, and thus forms the vent. 
4. Baking the Core. Great care must be taken in baking the 
core. If it is overbaked it will readily crumble, and if underbaked, 
or green, an excessive amount of gas will be formed. The length 
of time to leave the core in the oven (see Illus. 25), may be judged 
by the color and is best learned from experience. A core, when 
ready to remove from the oven, has turned a deep brown, while if 
left longer would turn black and be useless. 
Many cores are made in two or more parts and are pasted to- 
gether after baking. Ifa core is symmetrical, as in the case of the 
bushing and jack screw to follow, a one-half core box serves for the 
entire core, as two halves made from the same box are baked and 
joined together to form the complete core. 
After the core has been pasted together, the joint must be filled, 
or a ridge would form inside the casting. The process of filling 
the joint is known as “Daubing the Joint”.’* 
After the core has been daubed, it is painted all over with a 
coating of graphite which seals the pores of the sand and insures 
a smooth casting. 
All core boxes should be thoroughly cleaned after using. The 
work may be done to advantage by using a rag dipped in kerosene. 
If the box is not cleaned and allowed to stand, the remaining 
sand and oil will harden, and the box will become useless. 
16—THE GEAR BLANK. 
Castings from which gears are cut in a machine shop are termed 
“Gear Blanks”. A working drawing for such a blank (Plate 12) 
Jf the lead given a vent hole is to reach the molding sand, it will be neces- 
sary to carry that lead to the part of the core which will rest in the recess formed 
by the core print on the pattern. 3 
To prepare a mixture for daubing, secure some plumbago and mix with an 
equal part of fine parting sand, moistening with clay wash. The joint should be 
filled, after first brushing it, with a thin solution of blacking, and should finally 
be smoothed off even with the surface of the core.

  THE GEAR BLANK 65   
is furnished with this lesson so that the student may have an 
opportunity of using the face plate on the lathe, and may apply his 
knowledge of the principles and allowances in pattern making as 
studied thus far to the construction of a pattern for the gear blank. 
In order to get a hole in the gear blank, without any taper on 
the walls, it will be necessary to introduce a vertical core in the 
mold. To support the core in the mold, it will be necessary to have 
at least one core print on the base of the pattern, as shown in Fig. 
4, Plate 13. (Review Chap. 14, Cores and Core Prints). 
The casting, when machined, is to be 214” in diameter and 7%” 
thick. Certain surfaces are to be machined and are noted on the 
drawing by the letter “f’. These surfaces are increased on the 
pattern by 4%”, making the pattern 234” in diameter and 1)%” thick. 
To proceed with the work, secure a piece of stock about 314” 
in diameter and 114” thick. Fasten it to a face plate, as shown 
in Fig. 1, Plate 13, and screw the face plate on the threaded spindle 
of the lathe after having first removed the live center. A tool rest is 
placed in front and the piece is turned to 234”, having the edge. 
square with the front surface of the block. A slight amount of 
draft may be applied to this edge. In this case the calipers should 
slip over the work easily at “FG” and snug at “DE”, Fig. 1, Plate 13. 
The pattern is now turned to 1-14” thick. 
The core print will be attached to the pattern by a dowel pin 
that will be received in a small hole, as shown in the cross section, 
Fig. 2, Plate 13. This hole, which may be cut out on the lathe 
with a small skew chisel, should be about %4” in diameter and 
¥%" deep. In forming the hole on the lathe, it is bound to come 
exactly central and perfectly square with the surface. 
The work is now well sanded and removed from the lathe, and 
the screw holes on the face side of the pattern are filled with wax, 
after shellacing and sandpapering. Central on the face side con- 
struct a circle the same diameter as the core print to be made, and 
fill the area of the circle with black shellac. This indicates to the 
molder that the casting must come finished with a hole running 
through. If the hole were only to penetrate part ways into the 
casting, the face side of the pattern would remain clear. 
The core print is now turned to shape and the work is accom- 
plished between the two centers of the lathe. Again the drawing 
must be studied and the matter of finish marks on the hole con- 
sidered. The hole, when machined, must check up to 1”. To be 
able to accomplish this in the machine shop the casting must come 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
  
66 Woop Pattern MAKING 
in with a 34” hole. The core print which is to make provision 
for a 34” core must itself be turned to 34” diameter. The core 
print should project on the pattern about 1”.17 In turning up the 
print, the dowel pin at “A”, Fig. 3, Plate 13, should be turned at the 
dead center end which will allow the tail stock to be released and 
the pin fitted to the pattern without removing the same from the 
lathe. When the print is completed, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 13, 
it is given a coat of black shellac, and when dry it is glued into 
the pattern, after which the entire pattern is given a coat of white 
or orange shellac, and appears as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 13. If 
the pattern were molded and cast without any additional parts 
added to the pattern or the mold, we would have a casting the 
same shape as the pattern, but not with a hole through it as 
specified in the drawing. This can only be accomplished now 
by constructing a core box in which a lug of sand equal in diameter 
to the core print and the same length as the pattern plus the core 
print may be shaped. Fig. 5, Plate 13, shows a simple design for 
such a core box. In preparing the block, the only item of great 
importance is the depth of the block “Y” which must correspond to 
the length of the pattern “Y” in Fig. 4, Plate 13. Place the two 
blocks in a vise and locate for the dowels. Prepare two dowels, 
using the formula on Page 69, and place them as noted in Fig. 5, 
Plate 13. Gauge a center line across each end and where it crosses 
the intersection of the two pieces, construct a circle at both ends 
of the block. Separate the blocks, and with the marking gauge 
connect the ends of the semicircles, after which each section is 
gouged to shape with an inside ground gouge. The surface is then 
sand-papered and the inside shellaced black. The box, when com- 
plete, will resemble the sectional drawing, Fig. 5, Plate 13.18 
In preparing a core, the box is placed on an iron plate and the 
center filled with core sand, after which the two sides are parted 
and the operation is repeated as often as cores are wanted.!® 
“The diameter of a core print is always determined from the drawing. The length, however, that a print is to be made rests with the good judgment of the pattern maker. If a core is dependent for support in one recess of the mold, it Stands to reason that the print should be of a greater length than when supported at both ends. 
**Dowel pins may be omitted by sawing the block as shown in Fig. 5A, clamping blocks together and boring a hole the size of the core print. A small slot is sawed first for the spur of the bit to follow. 
Cores of this type are very common in the foundry. If the core is too long and slender to stand on end, it must lay upon the plate. It is common practice to roll the core onto the plate, but danger lies in the core baking with one flat side. If production warrants the expense, a special plate is made, having recesses of corresponding shape into which the core is laid until baked.
-P-A-G-E-67
  
Tue BusHING 67 
The pattern is molded as noted in the chapter on molding. The 
core is placed in the drag, and is fitted into the recess made 
by the core print, as shown in Fig. 6, Plate 13. If anything, it is 
well to have the core just a shade long so as to bear lightly against 
the cope in this case, as the core is only supported at one end. 
If the core happens to be too long, it will bear too hard against 
the cope, and probably result in the latter being cracked. 
Stock Cores. All progressive foundries carry more or less of a 
stock of cores for which there is a constant demand. For instance, 
in the case of the gear blank, from the standpoint of trade practice, 
it would hardly be necessary to prepare a core box as in most cases 
the foundry would be able to furnish a core of 34” diameter from 
the stock room, the length of which could be cut to fit the job. 
17—THE BUSHING 
A pattern for a cylindrical casting such as the bushing is 
generally made in two parts and termed a “Split Pattern”. The 
advantages gained in this construction are in the molding as will 
be explained later. That we may become acquainted with the 
general methods used in laying out a split pattern, we shall prepare 
a pattern for the bushing from the drawing, Plate 14. 
Before beginning the construction of the pattern, one should 
study the drawing with a view as to the best method of securing 
such a casting by molding. To secure the hole running the length 
of the casting it will be necessary to place a core in the mold, as 
in the case of the gear blank. However, owing to the size and 
construction of the casting, it will be advisable to place the core 
horizontally in the mold and support it in the mold at each end 
of the core. The two types of cores may be distinguished as 
“Vertical and Horizontal Cores”. The horizontal core placed in 
the mold is shown in Fig. 16, Plate 16. 
To accomplish the latter it will be necessary to prepare our 
pattern with a core print at each end, as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 15. 
Our drawing calls for (f) all over so that we must furnish a cast- 
ing 2144” diameter by 34” long with a 134” hole running length- 
wise through the center. 
Commence the pattern by squaring up a piece of stock 
14"x2¥%4"x16". Gauge a center line the length of the piece, as 
shown in Fig. 1, Plate 15. 
Since the pattern is a split pattern, it ill be necessary to cut 
the block into two parts. Place these two 8” pieces side by side in 
 
-P-A-G-E-68

Tur BusHING 69 
‘the vise that we may locate accurately for four holes, as shown in 
Fig. 2, Plate 15. 
With a sharp knife, square center line “CD” across the pieces, 
and 114” and 134” each side of line “CD” square two more lines, as 
shown in Fig. 2, Plate 15. At the four intersections marked “X”, 
bore four 4” holes 14” deep. These holes are to receive the dowels 
which are fastened securely in one of the pieces. The two pins are 
‘neatly shaped with a knife or sharp chisel. A very satisfactory 
formula for dowels is as follows: 
   
   PARTING LINE A equals the diameter of the dowel. 
D equals the diameter of the dowel. 
B equals % diameter of the dowel. 
C equals % diameter of the dowel. 
  ; | 
The purpose of the dowels is not to hold the parts together, 
but merely to keep the parts from slipping, or to keep them in 
their relative place during the process of molding. Hold the top 
piece in one hand. If the friction of the pins is enough to hold 
the bottom piece in the lifting, then it will be necessary to remove 
the pins and round the ends a trifle more until the two parts will 
part freely, when tested as noted above. The best method for 
rounding the dowels is to place them, one at a time, in a chuck 
on the lathe turning them round, or to use a file and sandpaper. 
Avoid whittling a point on the pin and throwing the work crudely 
together. 
The two blocks are placed together in a vise ends up, and 
corrugated fasteners are driven in the ends until they appear as in 
Fig. 3, Plate 15. These nails should project slightly so that they 
will be seen during the process of turning and the danger of turn- 
ing into them will be avoided.” 
Place the stock in the lathe and turn to its largest diameter 
2%4”. In setting the calipers it will be necessary to use a shrink 
rule. As the pattern is for a bronze casting, which is a form of 
brass, it will be necessary to use a 3/16” shrink rule. If a knife has 
been used in the laying out of the dowel holes as requested, three 
scars will now appear on the work at the intersection or joining of 
the two pieces, as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 15, “ABC”. “B” informs us 
“Corrugated fasteners are specified by the manufacturer as follows: First the length of nail, then the number of corrugations in it, as % No. 8,

that this is the center, from which all the laying out of the work 
should be done. “A” and “C” inform us that directly below are 
located two dowel pins, and that there should be no occasion for 
turning into them by placing the body of the pattern in the wrong 
portion of the stock. 
The body of the pattern is to be 314” long, and laid out 154” 
each side of the center scar. From each end of the body of the 
pattern turn the stock down to the diameter of the core prints which 
will be 1%4” when finished. Set the calipers a shade large, allowing 
a little for sandpapering. The core prints are next cut to length. 
For this operation the length may best be marked off with a pair 
of dividers, bringing one point up to the end of the bushing, bearing 
the other point on the work while the same is in motion. In work- 
ing on the ends of the work be sure and use the parting tool first, 
allowing enough stock so that the ends may be finished off with the 
skew chisel. 
The pattern is now well sanded all over, the core prints are 
colored, and the balance of the pattern is coated with orange 
shellac.** 
Before beginning the core box, the inside of the pattern is well 
sanded, and the shape of the core is generally printed on the drag 
half of the pattern, as shown in Fig. 5, Plate 15. In outlining the 
shape of the core, a knife line should be made, then the liquid 
shellac will cease to run as it flows into the knife line, and will form 
a clean straight edge. 
To lay out the core box, secure a piece of stock the same length 
as shown in the comparison between Figs. 5 and 6, Plate 15. The 
stock should be about 114” thick by about 2” wide, and a center 
line should be gauged down the face side. At each end a semi- 
circle must be marked off, radiating around the center line. This 
may be done best by clamping a block against the work, as shown 
in Fig. 8, Plate 16, which will allow the point of the compass to 
come in the exact position. 
The ends of the semi-circle are joined with gauge lines, as 
shown in Fig. 9, Plate 16, and the bulk of the stock removed with 
4If we are to follow the commercial practice as discussed in the shellacing of 
patterns:in Chap. I, it will be necessary to shellac the body of the pattern in its natural color and the core prints red. (For a brass casting.) 
Remember it is advisable to coat the entire pattern with the white or orange shellac before applying any colored shellac.

a gouge. If one has access to the circular saw the practical way. 
to remove the stock is by running numerous saw cuts along the 
work, as shown in Fig. 10, Plate 16. 
If the core box plane is not available, as shown in Fig. 12, Plate 
16, an inside ground gouge should be used. The trueness of the 
work may be tested out with a square by rotating it back and 
forth between the corners, as shown in Fig. 11, Plate 16. If the 
work is accurately done, the point of the square where the two 
sides meet will touch the surface at all places as the square is 
rotated back and forth. This is merely carrying out the principles 
of one of the problems in geometry and may be made more clear 
if one will undertake to construct a circle with the square. Secure 
two nails and place them on a board as far apart as you desire the 
diameter of the circle to be. Rotate the square between the nails 
holding a pencil point at the apex of the square and the results will 
be a circle. 
The principle of the core box plane is explained in the procedure 
taken with the square and pencil. Note in Fig. 12, Plate 16, that 
there are two sides to the plane. These are at right angles to each 
‘other. At the apex there is a pointed cutting knife and its location 
corresponds to the point at which the pencil was held. In operating 
it works between two points as was done with the square. Fig. 
13, Plate 16, shows the plane about to cut out a core box. Note 
the stock has been removed almost to the semi-circle. At each 
‘end of the semi-circle a portion of the stock is removed with a 
knife to the semi-circle so as to give a shoulder for the plane to 
| work against.”* Note that the knife must be set so as to cut on one 
side of the plane only. If the least bit is allowed to cut on the | 
other side, the shoulders between which the plane operates will 
be cut and the distance increased. Increasing the diameter will 
. increase the size of the core box and the work made useless. The — 
plane is operated from one end of the box to the other and brought 
back and repeated. Each time the point goes lower, but always in © 
line with the semi-circle. When the bottom of the box is reached 
the work is turned around and the other half of the box cut | 
in the same way. When through planing, the inside surface of 
™A thin strip of wood may be tacked along the path of travel to form the 
shoulders for the core box plane to bear against, in taking its first and second cuts. 
‘The inside edge of the strips should connect the ends of the semicircles.

the box will have a number of small ridges which will now have 
to be sanded out. At each end of the box fasten a small 14” strip. 
The ends of the box should first be slightly tapered so that when 
the end pieces are fastened their inside surface will show a slight 
amount of draft.” If a strip is then fastened to the sides and 
nailed into the end pieces, there will be no danger of the end pieces 
coming loose in practice. The inside of the box should be finished 
with a couple of coats of colored shellac. 
To use the core box, first prepare the sand as instructed before 
and pack in the box. Removing the box leaves the partial core 
on the iron plate as shown in Fig. 14, Plate 16. In order to com- 
plete one core, a second must be prepared and the two are then 
pasted together and appear as shown in Fig. 15, Plate 16.* After 
pasting, the joint is daubed and the core coated with graphite as 
explained before. 
A cross section of the mold showing the core in place is shown 
in Fig. 16, Plate 16. 
18—VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING STOCK FOR 
SPLIT PATTERNS. 
In the last lesson we learned of the general method of con- 
structing a split pattern. However, there are other methods that 
may be more convenient at times, and practical, the principles of 
which we shall discuss at this time. 
In addition to corrugated nails as a means of holding the two 
halves together while turning, screws may be used. See Fig. 17, 
Plate 17. A hole, large enough to accommodate a screw driver, 
is first bored and then the screw is inserted. This will protect the 
screw from the danger of running a tool into it. In addition to 
screws might be mentioned “Pinch Dogs” which are always more 
or less conspicious about the pattern shop. A cross section show- 
ing one in place is illustrated in Fig. 18, Plate 17. The pinch dog 
This taper may be accomplished by setting the band saw table to show an 
angle of 5 degrees, and then sawing off the end. Likewise, set the table of the cir- 
cular saw, or the table in front of the disk sander, or if desired use the plane. 
As an alternative to this procedure leave the ends of the box square, bring the 
end pieces into place, and on them trace the inside edge of the box. Remove the 
pieces, and with coarse sandpaper taper the surface inside of this area to the center 
of the semicircle. 
*Before pasting the halves of the cores together, it is customary to form vent 
openings By scratching the inside surface of the core from one end to the other. 
Care must be taken, however, not to block these openings when applying the paste. 
Another method would be to vent the core with a wire at the time of making. 
Owing to the construction of the box in its present shape, one cannot readily pass 
a wire from one end of the core to the other. A recess in which a wire may be 
passed directly through the core, may be formed by cutting a very small “V” notch 
at the center of each end of the box. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  16 ; Woop PatrerN MAKING   
is staple-like in its construction, but it is different from the staple 
owing to the fact that the inside of the jaws are tapered. The 
result of the tapered jaw is a powerful clamping effect when driven 
into the wood. 
The pinch dog has other uses about the shop than merely hold- 
ing stock together while turning. As an example picture yourself 
trying to clamp two parts of a pipe bend together when gluing, as 
shown in Fig. 19, Plate 17. Owing to its shape it would be prac- 
tically impossible to clamp the stock with ordinary hand clamps; 
however, pinch dogs may be driven into the two parts (Fig. 19, 
Plate 17,) which will draw the two parts together in a most satis- 
factory manner and hold in place until the glue sets. After the 
parts are secure the pinch dogs are removed and the holes are filled 
with beeswax. 
Again, if one is entirely without corr ugated nails, screws, or 
pinch dogs, a strip of paper may be glued between the two parts 
to be turned. This is sufficient to hold is wood together, but 
will readily split when separated with a chisel or plane blade. 
Wooden dowels were used in the construction of the bushing, 
but they have disadvantages when used out in the commercial 
world. The objection is due to the fact that wood swells when it 
comes in contact with moisture. The patterns being used in damp 
sand, the pins soon begin to swell and necessitate the whittling 
down again by the molder until they ee easily. He is then   able to proceed and finish up his mold satisfactorily. Sooner or 
later the pattern is stored away in the pattern vault. There the 
pins dry out and the next time the pattern goes to the foundry the 
pins are found to be too loose and new ones must be fitted in. This 
all takes time and costs money in the long run. For this reason 
metal dowels are used. Figs. 20 and 21, Plate 17, show two typical 
types of such pins. Note their construction. The section of the 
pin that enters the wood is threaded, and the thread is so tapered 
that it may be easily driven into the wood, bit only by forcing can 
it be withdrawn. 
For large patterns types of pins are used as shown in Figs. 22 
and 23, Plate 17. They are screwed to the pattern and the flange 
is sunk down into the wood. Metal dowels are made of brass so 
that they will not rust. 
In locating the dowel holes for the pattern of the bushing, knife

lines are used. This method has its advantage as the pins are 
readily located at all times, but it takes time. The holes for the 
pins may be quickly spotted by the use of brads which are laid 
between the two pieces, on the center line, and at the proper places, 
after which the two pieces are tapped together which results in aw 
impression of the brads on both pieces, as shown in Fig. 25, Plate 
17. If one desires to have the knife lines, they may be hastily 
squared across one of the pieces. “The holes are now bored and 
the impression made from the head of the brads is taken as a 
center. 
Again we find the pattern maker in a hurry to place the dowel 
pins. This time he bores the two holes first through one of the 
pieces. Then he places the two halves together in a vise and bores 
the holes in the second half. No bit gauge will be necessary if the 
turns of the bit are counted and it is estimated that the bit enters 
the wood (soft) 1/16” on each complete turn. The dowels are left 
long enough so that a portion of them act as a plug to the outside 
holes. : 
19—A JACK SCREW. 
For years the jack screw has been used as one of the best means 
of raising heavy bodies, such as buildings, vehicles, ete. Jack 
screws are made in various types and range greatly in size. A 
small jack screw, as described in this lesson, will ‘be found most 
practical and useful around the home and the garage (Plate 18). 
Study the Drawing. The profile of the jack screw does not 
vary greatly from that of the bushing, and will require practically 
the same construction. However, the inside of the casting shown 
on the drawing reveals an irregular surface and, owing to this 
irregular surface, the core box must be built up as will be described 
later. To support the core, a core print will be required at each 
end, See Fig. 3, Plate 19. 
The pattern may be constructed as a split pattern or it may be 
made solid. The solid pattern, however, will require more time 
and skill on the part of the molder. A solid’pattern is used exten- 
sively in the foundry, but the work of molding is simplified by the 
additional use of a “Match” or “Follow Board” as will be discussed

later in the book. At this period of the work it will be advisable 
to prepare for the jack screw a split pattern, as instructed in the 
previous lesson. Follow the general procedure given before except 
that the dowel pins may be placed farther apart, say 15%” each side 
of the center line. You will note in the preceding lesson that the 
pins were placed at different distances each side of the center line. 
This is done where both ends of the pattern are alike so that the 
molder will have no question in mind as to which way the pattern 
halves ought to go. In the jack screw, which has a different shape 
at each end, the pins may be located an equal distance each side 
of the center line. Study the drawing and turn the stock to its 
largest diameter which will be 234”. Why? An iron casting is 
wanted, what shrink rule will you use? The length of the casting 
will be 41%4”.. Why? Locate the center scar and with the dividers 
lay off 21%” to each side of the center line. The remaining stock 
available will be turned to form the two core prints. The large 
opening at the bottom does not call for (f) and will remain as cored 
on the finished jack screw or 11%” diameter which will be the 
diameter of the core print at that end of the pattern. At the 
other end a hole must be cored sufficiently small to allow for drilling 
and threading with a 34” tap. The hole cannot possibly be larger 
than 5%”, which diameter we will make the other core print. The 
stock when turned, as noted in the last bit of instruction, will now 
appear as shown in Fig. 2, Plate 19. Check the ends of the pattern 
and see that they are square with the center line of the pattern, or 
have a slight amount of draft. Bear in mind, when thinking about 
draft, that the pattern as it is in the lathe is in the same position 
that it will occupy in the mold. Too frequently these ends are 
ignored in the turning, and when removed from the lathe they are 
found not to be square, nor to have draft, but taper in; then it is too 
late to satisfactorily repair the ends. 
The body of the pattern is next tapered and the length of the 
core prints made to 34”, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 19. The work 
may be conveniently shellaced as it is held steady between the 
centers on the lathe after which it may be removed. If we are to 
follow our color scheme, it will be necessary to finish the pattern 
in black shellac, since it is for an iron casting. The core prints 
should again be red as in the case of the bushing. When it is dry

the ends may be trimmed off and sanded, and the two parts 
separated. Inside the pattern show the shape of the inside of the 
casting, or the core, as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 19. Use a knife in 
making the outline, and paint in this pictured area with black 
shellac. 
The core box is next prepared. Secure a piece of 134” stock 
2%” wide and cut it into three sections, as noted in the comparison 
between Figs. 4 and 5, Plate 19. Before cutting it into sections, 
place a center line along the piece and mark the divisions “AA” 
and “BB” so that the three pieces may readily be placed together 
after cutting. In sawing the blocks apart, it would be advisable to 
cut them on a miter box so that the ends will fit together perfectly. 
At the end of each block a semicircle is constructed. The diameter 
of the end pieces will equal the diameter of the two core prints, 
while the diameter required for the center section must be taken 
from the print which has been constructed on the cope side of the 
pattern. (See Fig. 4, Plate 19.) The ends of the semicircles are 
now connected with gauge lines or knife, as the case may require. 
They are then hollowed out with an inside ground gouge, and when 
finished will appear as shown in Fig. 7, Plate 20. Test the work 
with a square as noted before. Although it is possible to use the 
core box plane on this work, it is hardly advisable, owing to the 
smallness of the work. The end grain is then sized with a thin 
coat of glue and the sections are glued together, after which they 
are placed in a clamp and allowed to dry. If the work has been 
accurately done, the center section will form a 5/16” margin at 
each of the inside ends of the end sections. The corner, which is 
formed along this margin, will need a fillet as noted in Fig. 8, Plate 
20. For core box work, the leather fillet will probably give the 
most satisfaction, as the core sand very often has a tendency to 
stick to the beeswax, and it is sometimes impossible to get a good 
core where the wax has been used. 
The sides and ends are next fitted with strips of wood 14” to 
4" thick, as shown in Fig. 8, Plate 20. One might think the strips 
unnecessary, but they are needed as the continual rapping of the 
box in the making of the core would soon jar the sections loose. 
*If the student has access to the circular saw, the side pieces may be omitted, and as an alternative a slot may be cut down the center, in this case about 4” deep and 4” wide. In this slot a spline is glued, using the same material as that from qhich the core box has been made.

Finish the inside of the box with black shellac and the outside with 
red shellac. 
From the box prepare several partial cores, each one appearing 
on the plate as shown in Fig. 9, Plate 20.°° When pasted together 
they will appear as shown in Fig. 10, Plate 20. Daub up the joint 
and finish with a coat of graphite. A cross section of the mold 
with the core in place is shown in Fig. 11, Plate 20. 
20—FILLETS 
Sharp corners on a pattern, whether inside or out, should be 
avoided for at least the following reasons: 
1. Sharp corners weaken a casting. 
2. Round corners mold easier. 
3. Round corners add to the appearance of the casting. 
Fig. 1, Plate 21, illustrates a cross section of a casting, the 
inside and outside corners of which have been cast square. As the 
iron changes from a liquid to a solid state the little molecules of 
which the iron is composed seat themselves perpendicular to the 
surface of the casting. As the corner of the casting is approached 
we find the molecules pulling in two opposite directions. This 
action results in making the casting porous in the corner as shown 
in Fig. 1, Plate 21. This evilis particularly worthy of consideration 
in the case of cylinder heads and other castings which are subject 
to great pressure and strain. 
For rounding corners a special tool, very simple in construction 
has been prepared. It is illustrated in Fig. 4, Plate 21. The tool 
comes in various sizes and has two sizes to the individual tool. 
To use the tool it is merely drawn along the corner in the direc- 
tion that the grain runs. The construction of the tool allows only 
so much of the stock to be removed, at which time the corner will 
be found to be rounded in excellent shape. When such a tool is 
not available, and when other conditions do not permit, the work 
will have to be done with the plane, spoke shave, or any tool 
suited to the work and finished off with sandpaper. 
On inside work it is necessary to fill in the corner with certain 
materials which are later shaped. This is known as a fillet. Bees- 
wax, leather, wood, and metal are all used at times as fillets. 
*The core for the Jack Screw will have to be vented in the same manner as 
noted in the instruction on the Bushing.

FILLets 85 
Beeswax perhaps is used the most extensively for fillets, with 
leather next.?7 
Beeswax is probably used the most owing to its cheapness and 
the ease with which it is applied. Added to this is the fact that it 
makes a very neat job and can be applied to any shape of corner. 
Leather fillets are used on the better grades of patterns where 
durability and neatness are both considered. They come more 
expensive both from a standpoint of material and the time taken 
in their application. 
A wood fillet is only applicable on straight corners; and 
although more or less troublesome to apply, it is a neat and durable 
fillet, inexpensive and always on hand. 
The metal fillets are also only practical on straight corners. 
However, they cause considerable trouble in the foundry as the 
continuous rapping of the pattern causes the nails or brads with 
which they are applied to loosen. Both the wax and leather fillets 
are applied and shaped with a fillet tool shown in Fig. 5, Plate 21. 
The fillet tool, which is made of metal, has a small ball of a different 
diameter at each end. Several of these fillet tools of different 
sizes form a set. 
Wax fillets may be bought in round strips, resembling string, 
and of different diameters such as %”, 1%4”, etc. They may also be 
bought, already molded in strips with two sides at right angles 
and the third side rounded concavely as would be accomplished 
by the use of the fillet tool. To apply a wax strip as ‘mentioned 
first, lay the strip in the corner of the work (Fig. 6, Plate 21). 
Warm the ball of the fillet tool slightly and run it along the center 
of the wax strip pressing toward the corner. This will result in 
shaping the wax as shown in Fig. 7, Plate 21. The surplus wax 
which is pressed out to one side of the fillet should be removed 
with a knife. Having placed fillets in all corners required, take a 
rag dipped in gasoline or turpentine, and wash lightly over all the 
surface treated.** The second type of wax fillets mentioned is 
applied in the same way, only less time is required in the applica- 
tion and removing of the surplus wax. 
Putty also. is used as a material for fillets. The material, however, is not 
satisfactory as it takes several days for the putty to harden, and’as it readily works 
loose it could only be used on a pattern for temporary use. 
~The action of the gasoline is to polish up the fillet and remove, such specks 
as may have been left by the tool and not removed with the surplus wax.

FILtets 8? 
In applying a leather fillet the following procedure may be 
helpful. If the leather is stiff and refuses to fit in a corner, it 
should be soaked in water, preferably hot, for a few minutes. The 
two sides that are to be fastened in the corner are coated with 
glue and then placed in the corner. At the starting end the fillet 
may be held down with a small brad, then the fillet tool is run 
along the fillet squeezing out as much glue as possible, shaping 
the fillet at the same time. Wipe off the extra glue with a damp 
rag. Occasionally here and there an additional brad may be used. 
The fillet must be watched for a while, and if the edges start to 
curl up they should again be gone over with the tool and a little 
glue added where it appears necessary. 
Wood fillets are on the market all machined to shape, but 
owing to their delicacy and the fact that the edges have a bad 
tendency to continue to curl up during the process of gluing them 
in, they can hardly be called practical. If a wood fillet is wished 
for on a pattern or if no others are available, and the corner is of 
such shape that a wood fillet will serve the purpose, the following 
procedure is probably the most advisable. A square or triangular 
strip of suitable size is glued in the corner and is allowed to dry 
(Fig. 8, Plate 21), after which it is gouged to shape, as shown by the 
curved line. 
Strings of wax for fillets may be easily shaped and the work 
found fascinating by the boys in the shop. A “fillet gun” will first 
have to be prepared (Fig. 9, Plate 22). Secure a brass tube 
of about 114” diameter and securely plug up one end. A maple 
plug, held in place with round-headed screws, will do. Next turn 
up a plunger that fits snugly in the tube and is of sufficient length 
to extend a few inches beyond when fully inserted. Just inside 
the plug, small holes of various diameters, say from 1/16” to 14”, 
are drilled. If only one tube is prepared, divide the holes around 
the tube about two of each size, or prepare several guns having a 
standard lot of holes in each one. To operate the tube or gun, 
fill it with small pieces of wax and warm it, but not so warm as 
to cause the wax to run out in a stream. Place the gun in a bar 
clamp. The end of the bar clamp may be held in a vise. The 
clamp is then screwed up to force the plunger into the tube and the 
wax out through the holes. Before they harden the fillets should 
be gathered up at once and rolled into a convenient bundle or laid 
flat in a long box.

Leather fillets also may be shaped in the shop from strips of 
leather. The strips are cut with a special tool, similar to that 
shown in the sketch, Fig. 10, Plate 22. -The cutting blade, or cutter, 
is triangular in shape and may be operated up or down by loosen- 
ing the set screw. The depth of the cut adjusts the size of the 
fillet which the tool will shape. To operate, the strip of leather 
is held firmly on the bench and the tool passes along it as one 
would operate a plane on a piece of wood, the fillet coming up 
inside of the cutter and passing out over the handle. 
21—A GIB 
In the construction of machines many parts are used. Some of 
the parts must be movable and still bound together. To accom- 
plish this end the bearing surface is often constructed as shown in 
the working drawing of a gib, Plate 23. For instance, the tool 
holder on a machine lathe is attached to a gib, and the slide on 
which it operates is known as a gibbed way. 
The working drawing of the gib, Plate 23, is presented to the 
student that he may become acquainted with a new principle in 
pattern making, that of loose pieces. In the pattern shop it is rare 
that a job comes in, in which the pattern maker does not have to 
make some adjustment on the pattern to allow it to be withdrawn 
from the sand. The adjustments possibly may be divided into two 
large groups. That is, the adjustment is made by coring the work 
or the pattern has a section of it loose. The principle is to have 
these loose pieces remain in the mold until the center or body of 
the pattern has been removed, allowing the loose pieces to be 
brought to the center of the mold and out through the path left 
by the body of the pattern. The occasion for loose pieces and the 
best method of holding them to the pattern to meet the require- 
ments of molding is the next step to be mastered by the young 
apprentice. 
The casting for the gib appears as in Fig. 1, Plate 24. The 
pattern is constructed with the same profile, except that the 60 
degree pieces are made separate, as shown later in Fig. 6, Plate 24. 
The pattern is composed, or built up, of five pieces, the speci- 
fications for each piece being shown in the working drawings Figs. 
2, 3 and 4, Plate 24. Compare these dimensions with the working

drawing and see if they are correct. Note that the drawing calls 
for “f” all over. Assemble the first part of the pattern as shown 
in Fig. 5, Plate 24. These parts should be glued and bradded 
together. Brad them first and check as to squareness and distance 
between parts and then, if O. K. remove the brads, and glue the 
parts together. The two remaining pieces may be placed in the 
pattern and a 60 degree line drawn across the ends, placing the 
triangle bottom edge along the face edge of the pattern. To plane 
these small strips they might best be held in a vise, bringing their 
ends against the jaws of the vise. These strips are held in place 
in the pattern by small brads or nails.’® 
These pins, however, are not permanent, nor are they driven 
tight into the pattern. The pins should be sufficiently loose that 
they may be easily removed with the fingers. This may be best 
accomplished by first driving in a nail larger than the one to be 
used, or by drilling the holes with a drill a shade larger than the 
pins to be used. 
If there are any loose pieces, the sides that go against the 
pattern are colored yellow. The pattern is colored black, but that 
part of the pattern against which the loose pieces go is also colored 
yellow, so that when the pieces are in place no yellow shellac can 
‘be seen. 
To mold the pattern, place it on a molding board and, with the 
drag in place, cover the pattern with finely sifted sand. With the 
fingers tuck the sand about the pattern and firmly against and be- 
tween the loose pieces. When the sand has been packed with 
the fingers sufficiently firm to hold the loose pieces in place, the 
pins are ready for removal from the pattern and the molding is 
proceeded with as usual. The cope, being later lifted off and the 
pattern removed, finds the two pieces still in the mold (Fig. 8, 
Plate 24). These pieces are now coaxed over and are lifted out 
with the draw pin through the space left by.the pattern, as shown 
in Fig. 9, Plate 24, 
2°Pins as described above are used in this particular problem, because they are the most rigid means of holding these small pieces in place during the beginning 
process of molding. 
When the bearing surface of the loose piece is large or wide enough so as to 
support itself on the pattern, and the pieces are to remain on the bottom of the 
mold as in this particular case, dowel pins may be used between the loose parts 
ae the body of the pattern as described in the instruction on preparing split 
patterns. 
The use of pins as described above in the instruction is especially adapted to 
small pieces such as bosses, small pads and the like as may come on the sides of 
a pattern and which could not be held in place by permanent dowel pins,

The projection on 
the side of a pattern 
is often held in place 
by a dovetailed con- 
struction. A pattern 
with the piece re- 
moved and of this con- 
struction is shown in 
Illus. 26. The sides 
of the dovetailed 
ee piece are tapered, like 
draft on a pattern, so that the piece is easily removed from the 
pattern. The “GIB”, with loose pieces so dovetailed, is shown in 
Fig. 10, Plate 24. 
    
22—AN EYE BOLT 
Quite often’ the pattern maker finds it necessary to prepare a 
pattern where part of the same piece of stock is worked to shape 
on the lathe and part of the work is done by hand or on other 
machines. As an example of this type of work, we shall prepare 
a pattern for an eye bolt, the working drawing of which is fur- 
nished in Plate 25. 
To prepare the pattern, first, square up a piece of stock 
114"x34"x6%", as shown in Fig. 1, Plate 26. Three inches of this 
stock will be turned to shape on the wood-turning lathe. It is 
advisable to remove what stock is not needed, as shown in Fig. 2, 
Plate 26. Having previously run centerlines about the piece as 
shown in Fig. 1, Plate 26, the piece is then placed accurately in 
the lathe. In placing the stock in the lathe, have the section to be 
turned bearing on the dead center end. The driving center should 
be at the strongest portion of the stock, and again the tools should 
be kept as far away from the live center as possible. 
Turn the piece to 144”, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 26. Two and 
one-quarter inches from the end, the stock is now turned to a 
diameter of 54”, as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 26. This leaves a section 
of the stock remaining 114” diameter x 34” long. On this section 
mark off a 14” space, measuring over from the shoulder as shown 
in Fig. 5, Plate 26. Between this line and the remaining stock 
the work has to be rounded out to a diameter of 54” at its smallest 
part. The work should be done with a round nose tool. Unless

the tool is ground correctly, that is perfectly round, it will be 
almost impossible to get the results wanted on the work. The 
other end of the work is pointed with the skew chisel and later 
* removed from the lathe, and the point is finished up with a jack 
knife. Before removing from the lathe, the work should be well 
sanded and the shoulder adjoining the 5g” spindle should be tapered 
slightly for draft. 
The work is then removed from the lathe and the remaining 
part of the stock is treated with the marking gauge. The stock 
should be worked from the face side only with the gauge set so as 
to mark off the central portion 5g” between the gauge lines. The 
stock is then lined up with the band saw and the outside portions 
are cut off, leaving the stock as it appears in Fig. 7, Plate 26. 
The center lines are again scribed on the newly-cut surfaces 
and a center line is squared around the stock, as shown in Fig. 7, 
Plate 26. With the intersection of these center lines we are fur- 
nished the center of the eye. With this as a center, construct two 
circles, 114” diameter, and 234” diameter. The outside circle should 
be continued so that its end will run into the profile of the bolt as 
formed on the lathe. 
The center circle must now be bored out. Owing to the size 
of the hole and delicacy of the piece, it will split unless placed in 
some form of clamp. This may be accomplished by holding the 
work between the jaws of the vise as shown in Fig. 8, Plate 27. 
The hole must be bored with an expansive bit. This type of bit 
is shown in Fig. 9, Plate 27. Set the cutter so as to cut a 144” 
hole. This is done by loosening the set screw at the front which 
will then release the screw at the side so that it may be turned 
to move the cutter back and forth. When at the point desired the 
set screw is again tightened and the work of boring is proceeded 
with. Before boring the hole, it is advisable to drill out the center 
of the hole with a drill about the size of the spur of an expansive 
bit. The spur on the bit does not remove any material but spreads 
it, and the stock is likely to become split even though it is held in 
a vise if it is not first drilled. In boring, turn the stock around as 
soon as the spur of the bit penetrates the other side. As soon as 
the hole is cut, remove the stock from the vise and place it on a 
scrap block, preferably the piece that was removed from that side.

The work is cut out on the saw, as shown in Fig. 10, Plate 27, 
which leaves the éye with four sides as shown in Fig. 11, Plate 27. 
In proceeding to transform the square cross section of the eye to a 
round one, it is best to first change the eye from four to eight sides. 
‘For this we will need guide lines. These lines may best be put on 
with a pencil, using the fingers as a guide against the side of the 
work. Aim to get the distance between the lines equal, as shown 
‘in Fig. 12, Plate 27, so that when the stock has been removed it will 
appear as shown in the cross-section drawing. Fig. 13, Plate 27. 
If the work has been carefully done the eye may now be easily 
rounded with coarse sandpaper, after which the work should be 
gone over with fine sandpaper and all scratches, etc., removed. 
When the piece looks satisfactory and the surface of the eye is 
uniform, the work should be given three coats of shellac. 
The eye bolt makes an excellent project for elementary molding. 
Let the flange into the molding board and then proceed in the 
usual manner up to the time the drag has been turned over and the 
bottom board removed. It is now necessary to cut the sand down 
to the parting line of the pattern, or that line at which the bottom 
half of the pattern may be lifted from the mold without disturbing 
‘any of the sand about it. This may be overdone so that, when the 
‘cope is lifted, the sand about the pattern formed in the cope will 
break. It is important then that the exact line be found and the 
sand cut exactly to that line.°° 
The eye bolt makes’ an excellent project to be used with a 
match or follow board. See chapter on “How to make a match or 
follow board”. 
23—A BEARING 
The location of the cores and core prints does not always come 
as convenient for the pattern maker and the molder as in the 
problems worked out so far. 
In Fig. 1, Plate 29, we show a perspective view of a bearing for

*It is often difficult for some students to determine just where the parting line 
comes on a pattern. In this case we might illustrate. Supposing the pattern were 
placed on a table in the same position that it would lie on a molding board, and 
directly above the small pattern some few feet away were hanging a bright electric 
light. Part of the pattern would be in the light and part in darkness, and that line 
which separates the light and darkness would be the parting line of the pattern. In using this illustration on a large pattern it would be necessary to think of the 
light as being directly above each part of the pattern in question.

discuss, and to make clear by molding illustrations, the 
purpose of the type of core print shown in Fig. 5, Plate 29. The 
profile of the print, when viewed from a certain side, resembles the 
letter “D” and for this reason is known as a “D Print”. It is also 
known among tradesmen as a “Tail Print”. 
To prepare a pattern for a bearing, secure a block 6” long, 314” 
wide, and 214” thick. Square up the face side and the other four 
edges of the block. Take your knife, and square a center line 
across the face side, the working edge, and the other edge of the 
block. Set the gauge for 144”, and locate center lines for laying 
out the plan of the bearing on each side of the block, but bear in 
mind that this distance must include the extra 144” which must be 
allowed for finish “f” on the bottom of the pattern. After the 
center lines are constructed, proceed to lay out the profile of the 
bearing on each side of the block, after which the pattern may be 
cut to shape. Sandpaper the new surface, working closely to the 
construction line. Next construct the four radii for the corners of 
the pattern, and locate the center lines for the “Bosses”. The 
pattern should now look like Fig. 3, Plate 29. Then cut the corners 
round and sandpaper the surfaces. 
Secure two pieces of 4” stock about 114” by 3”, brad them 
together and prepare a working edge. From this edge, gauge a 
center line on both sides of the block; also take a knife and square 
a line across both sides so that the core prints can be laid out and 
shaped as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 29. Sand the new edge of the 
print smooth and then connect the ends of the center lines on both 
sides of the core print. The blocks may now be separated and the 
prints fastened to the pattern, thus bringing the center lines on the 
print and those on the pattern together. 
The two “Bosses” are next prepared. Secure a small face plate 
with a screw through the center and fasten this to a piece 114” or 
2” in diameter and about 214” long. Turn one of the bosses to 
shape and cut off with a cutting-off tool. Repeat the operation and 
prepare a second boss. See Fig. 6, Plate 29. Do not overlook the 
fact that the boss calls for “f” on the drawing. The fillet which is 
turned in shaping the boss can best be accomplished with a round 
nose tool, as shown in Fig. 6. The bosses are then fastened to the 
pattern which resembles Fig. 5, Plate 29. 
Center lines for the bosses are next placed on the pattern, and

at the intersections circles are drawn of the same size as the bosses 
in which they are now glued. 
On top of the bearing a small boss is also required to receive 
an oil or grease cup. This boss could have been made out of the 
solid block, but instead a piece of stock with the grain running 
parallel to that of the pattern may be glued on. The boss is then 
laid out, and cut, including the fillet. 
Next prepare a three piece core box, the shape of the coring 
being noted on the working drawing**. The core box when finished 
must exactly correspond to the pattern, as noted in the comparison 
of Figs. 5 and 7, Plate 29. The corners inside the core box that 
will form the core, that part of it which will act in shaping the 
iron in the mold, are filled with fillets. The cores are made in 
halves and when joined together will appear as shown in Fig. 8, 
Plate 29. Finish up the core as noted in previous chapters. 
The pattern now goes to the foundry where a mold is made. 
Being a one piece pattern, the mold will be shaped in the drag, 
the cope taking the impression of the face only and forming the 
sprue hole. A cross section of the drag passing through the center 
of the mold and the core recesses would appear to the eye as shown 
in Fig. 9, Plate 29. 
The next step is to place the core in the mold. The mold is too 
small to allow the hands down into it and it will therefore be advis- 
able to lower the core with a strip of paper as shown in cross 
section, Fig. 11, Plate 30. 
If the mold were now filled with iron, we would find at least 
two obstacles before us, namely the casting would have lugs at 
each end where the recesses were not filled, and the core lying 
free in the mold would float upon the incoming metal like a cork 
on water. It is then necessary to fill in this recess after the core 
_ has been placed. In using this type of core, as shown in Fig. 8, 
Plate 29, the recesses may be quickly and uniformly filled by mak- 
ing a “Molder’s Shingle” (Fig. 10, Plate 29). Make the shingle 
from stock equal to the thickness of the wall of the casting which is 
_ ¥%”". This will allow the shingle to fit rigidly in the mold between 
the bulge of the core and the wall of the mold. The semi-circle 
The bearing is cored out, as specified on the drawing, to allow for babbit 
fined up. “he babbit is then poured in through the epeniue for the oll connate When such a bearing becomes worn it must be rebabbited. For this reason bearings are generally made in two parts, so that a bearing may occasionally be 
taken up for wear.

at the bottom is made the same diameter as the smallest diameter 
of the core. The balance of the shingle is made slightly wider 
than the core print, not to exceed the size of the side of the 
pattern. After the core is in place the shingle is let down into 
the mold until it rests on the core and is held firmly against the 
wall of the mold. See Fig. 12, Plate 30. The recess is then filled 
with finely sifted sand and tucked down until firm. Remove the 
shingle and repeat in the other recess. This process can only be 
termed practical when a few castings are wanted. 
If the pattern were going on a production job, it would pay to 
construct a core box in which the core produced would entirely 
fill the mold as shown in Fig. 14, Plate 30, and the core in Fig. 13, 
Plate 30. 
24—A TOOL REST 
The tool rest shown in Fig. 1, Plate 32, is used to rest the tools 
on in operating the wood turning lathe. We shall prepare this 
pattern as a typical type of pattern for use with a match, the con- 
struction of which is discussed in the following chapter. 
To construct the pattern, as shown in Fig. 1, Plate 32, it is 
first necessary to square up a block of wood from 114” stock, 8” 
long and 2%4” wide. Four inches from one end square a center 
line around the block, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 32. Come in from 
one edge, 11/16” along this center line, and bore a 14” hole so that 
it penetrates entirely through the piece. At each end of the block 
lay off lines that will give the location of the two tapered sides of 
the rest. Remove the stock to these lines. The bulk of the stock 
may be removed by sawing first and then finishing up the surfaces 
with the plane. If the student has access to an edger or bench 
planer the surfaces may be quickly and accurately finished in this 
manner. 
Next prepare the post, as shown in Fig. 2, Plate 32. Make the 
pin long enough to project through the tool rest. This will be 
needed on the casting as a center for turning up the post on the 
casting, in the machine shop. The post calls for finish “f” 
which must not be overlooked on the pattern. The shape of the 
test is next drawn on the beveled block, as shown in Fig. 4, Plate 
32. Before sawing out the rest to this shape, attach the post as 
shown in Fig. 5, Plate 32, and proceed to saw out the rest on the jig

or band saw as shown in Fig. 6, Plate 32. With the post in position 
at this time, bring the pattern in place on the bed of the saw in the 
same position as it will be later in the mold. The saw cutting at 
right angles to the bed of the saw, bring the new sides in a proper 
plane for the molding. The surfaces are now rounded and tapered 
to fit around the post, after which they are well sanded and the 
post is glued in place. Place a small fillet around the top of 
the post where it meets the tool rest. Finish the pattern with 
three coats of shellac. 
In molding the pattern it is placed on the molding board (or in 
2 match) in the same position as shown in the illustration of saw- 
ing, Fig. 6, Plate 32. The molding is proceeded with as noted 
before, until the drag has been rolled over and the molding board 
removed. At this time we find the pattern almost buried in the 
sand. All the sand that lies on top of the pattern must be removed 
down tothe parting line. (See Illus. 27, “Making a Match”). 
Having arrived at what is thought to be the parting line, the next 
step is to have the surface of the sand from the parting line, take a 
gradual slope extending out to the edge of the flask. The question 
of just how far down to cut, to locate the parting line of the pat- 
tern, is an art which must be mastered by the student. (See foot 
note under “Eye Bolt.”) It sometimes happens that a mean part- 
ing has to be determined and the molder is not just sure of it. He 
then takes some damp parting sand having no bond and places a 
sufficient quantity of it at this spot, so if a break in the sand is to 
come, it will be sure to come in the parting sand and at a safe place 
“in the mold. 
25—CONSTRUCTION OF A PLASTER PARIS MATCH. 
The making of matches is an important part of the work of the 
foundry. Such patterns as cylinders or bushings, and irregularly 
shaped patterns, such as the lathe rest, are generally used with a 
match. The match takes the place of the molding board in the 
process of molding. In the match is placed the pattern, and it is 
so designed that, as the sand is sifted over the pattern, the mold 
is formed to shape along the parting line of the pattern. 
To construct a match for the tool rest, prepare a frame from 
34,” stock and as wide as the thickness of the stock from which the 
flask is made. The length and width of the frame should exactly fit 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
A PLASTER Paris MatcH 107   
onto the drag, as does the cope. Along the inside of the frame 
numerous nails should be driven and allowed to project. The 
purpose of the nails will be to anchor whatever material is later 
placed in the frame. 
Before the match can be treated further it is necessary to 
prepare the drag for the rest pattern. After the drag has been 
rolled over and the sand cut down to the parting line, as shown in 
Illus. 27, the frame just prepared is placed on the drag in the same 
manner as the cope would be, and filled with plaster paris.** If 
plaster paris is used a great shrinkage in the material will result 
after it has been poured, as it immediately begins to set. This 
cavity must be filled until the entire frame is filled with the hard 
  Tus. 27 and 28. 
material. Following this a bottom board is nailed onto the frame 
and it is then removed from the drag. The plaster paris will then 
have acquired the same shape as it would have had in the cope of 
the mold, as shown in Illus. 28, except that the sprue hole shown 
would be lacking. However, a plaster paris match will not stand 
up under long and hard usage. Where a permanent match is 
required, it is customary to fill the frame with oiled sand and 
litharge, as one would prepare for a core, after which the bottom is 
placed and it is allowed to harden in a warm oven. 
The match is sometimes worked to shape from wood. 
26—A TOOL REST HOLDER 
It very often happens that a core has to lie horizontally in a 
mold, supported only from one end of the core. The core print is 
Matches are also made of oiled sand as is used in making cores.

made of such a length that the section of core lying in the recess 
is greater in size than that part suspended out in the mold, the 
result being that the part in the recess overbalances that part out 
in the mold and the core and core print are termed “Balance Core” 
and “Balanced Core Print”, or “Tail Piece”. 
In the construction of the holder for the tool rest on the lathe, 
and as shown in Plate 33, we shall use a balance core 
in securing the “T” slot in the base of the casting. That we may 
more clearly understand this type of core, we shall construct the 
holder for our practical work in this lesson. 
In the first place we shall construct a split pattern. To begin 
the construction prepare the post of the holder first. This will be | 
made from two pieces of stock with only one dowel, as shown in 
Fig. 2, Plate 34. Be sure to use a knife line in the laying out of 
the dowel hole so that we can properly construct the post and bring 
the dowel in the proper location. The post will be attached to 
the base by a projecting piece one inch in diameter and one-half 
inch long. 
The base of the holder is 7” thick when finished. Adding “f” 
it will be necessary to construct the base from 1” stock. Being 
a split pattern, we shall need two of these 1” strips, each 114” 
wide and 8%” long. i 
Clamp these two strips together and lay out the profile of the 
pattern (Fig. 3, Plate 34). In laying it out first construct center 
lines “AB” and “CD”. At the intersection of the two strips and 
the center lines construct the semicircles, and at the center of | 
“AB”, and joining of the pieces, bore a 1” hole, %4” deep, to receive 
the post.* The pieces are now separated and a 5/16” space is 
gauged along the edge of the strip from the 1” hole to the end of 
the piece. See Fig. 3, Plate 34. When the same has been cut out, 
which is the next step in the work, the section of one piece will 
resemble Fig. 4, Plate 34. 
“In these recesses just made, we shall attach the core prints | 
which will be made from 5/16” stock, 214” wide and of sufficient 
length to bring the print up to the 1” hole. See Fig. 5, Plate 
34. Before gluing the core print to the pattern, a small 
part of the print will be found to be intersecting with the 1” hole. 
*The two pieces may be held together between the jaws of a small hand 
clamp or by driving a “Pinch Dog” into each end of the work.

This must be trimmed out in order to properly receive the core 
print which next must be attached to the base of the pattern. 
The question arises at this time as to how the length of the core 
print was estimated. This may be more clearly understood when 
we come to the operation of molding the pattern, as can be seen 
in the cross section of the mold, Fig. 12, Plate 35. 
Having glued the post to the pattern, it now resembles Fig. 6, 
Plate 34, except that only one dowel is in place, that being in the 
post. Bring the halves of the pattern together in the proper 
location, and with the proper size bit bore through the core print, 
as located in Fig. 6, Plate 34. It will not be necessary to bore 
through both pieces, but the operation should cease as the spur 
of the bit comes through the second piece. The pattern is now 
parted and a dowel, similar to the one used in the post, is placed in 
the core print, care being taken to place the dowel in the same half 
of the pattern. 
At the end of the pattern show the shape of the slot to be in 
the casting. In this outline fill with black shellac, and along the 
outside of the core print and inside the pattern as shaded in Figs. 
5 and 6, Plate 34. 
Next prepare two lugs as shown in Fig. 7, Plate 35. The pur- 
pose of these lugs on the casting is to clamp the post of the tool 
rest in place. Brad the two pieces of stock together and cut both 
of them out at one time, after which sand them well and glue 
them to the post. The fastening may be made stronger by increas- 
ing the width of the ear and cutting out a recess in the post to 
receive them, as shown in Fig. 8, Plate 35. 
Fig. 9, Plate 35, shows the construction of the core box and a 
comparison of its length with that of the pattern. The inside of 
the box is shaped to form one-half of the “T”. The construction 
of the box is very simple. First prepare the base and next the 
strip which is placed upon it. Follow this by the sides and the 
ends. The inside of the box should show a slight amount of draft, 
with a small fillet along the bottom corners of the box which have 
to do with the shaping of the iron casting. 
Fig. 10, Plate 35, shows a core just as the box is being removed 
after shaping. Two of these cores are pasted together and finished 
up for use as described before. Unless the joint is properly filled, 
or daubed, a ridge will form along the top of the slot inside the

casting, which will hinder the square headed bolt from entering the 
slot freely. Fig. 11, Plate 35, shows the two partial cores pasted 
together ready for use. In Fig. 12, Plate 35, a cross section of the 
mold with the core in place is shown. Note the section of the 
core as it lies in the recess and its length as compared with the 
section projecting into the mold. 
In the discussion of the construction of the pattern for the 
“Tool Rest Holder”, it was aimed to make the work as elementary 
as possible, as has been the case in all the preceding problems. 
From a commercial standpoint, it would also be necessary to core 
out the post as noted in the working drawing. If the student is 
advanced enough he should try to do this. The work may be done 
so as to involve two separate cores, or one core may be designed to 
cover the whole job. A right core and a left core will be necessary. 
If properly designed, and if both cores include a stop-off piece for 
the post, they can be made in one core box. 
27—A PULLEY 
In the construction of the pattern for a pulley we come into a 
new class of work—commonly known in the pattern shop as 
“Built Up Patterns”. We speak of this type of work as “built up” 
because the work, being symmetrical, permits the rim to be built 
up of segments, as shown in Fig. 6, Plate 37. The reason for this 
may be made clear if we consider such a pattern as turned from 
a solid piece of wood. The shape of the rim would not remain a 
true circle for any length of time; it would soon begin to shrink. 
As the yood only shrinks across the grain, the wheel would be 
shrinking in one direction only and would soon become out of 
round. Again the rim would be weak and easily broken. 
All of these troubles are overcome when the pattern is built up 
of segments. The shrinkage of the wood being across each seg- 
ment makes the shrinkage of the wheel uniform, while the rim 
being composed of lapping segments makes the rim unusually 
strong. 
To begin work on the pattern prepare a face plate about 34” 
larger than the diameter of the proposed pulley wheel. Should the 
pulley be of a large diameter, the face plate on which the work is 
built up may be strengthened by batten boards, as shown in 
Tllus. 29. 
Study the drawing (Plate 36) and determine the inside and the 
outside diameter of the finished pattern. The finished size out-

side is 8” to which must be added “f” on both sides, making the 
total diameter of the pattern 8%4”.. Turn the face plate to 834” in 
diameter which will allow 3%” for trimming the work to size on the 
lathe, as noted in Fig. 2, Plate 37. The inside of the rim which does 
not call for (f) is 714” in diameter. We will construct a similar 
circle on the face plate, making the same allowance for trimming 
on the pattern which would bring the construction circle to a 
diameter of 7”. The face plate may now be divided into as many 
parts as the number of segments wanted. Up to 17” in diameter, 
four parts will be sufficient. Six or more parts may be used to good 
advantage for anything above 17”. 
The template is next prepared. ,In fact, it should be made and 
used as one of the segments. The template should be made the 
correct size, while the segments may be cut a shade longer. In 
building up the rim it can be prepared in two parts or halves, each

part consisting of three layers of segments, or twenty-four seg- 
ments in all. In marking off the segments, be sure that the grain 
runs with the length of the segment so that the grain in the rim 
will practically run around the wheel, thus avoiding an end grain, 
for reasons noted at the beginning of the lesson. Several segments 
can be cut in one operation, thus saving time. This can be done by 
tacking several pieces of stock together and treating them as one 
piece. Before any gluing is done, the first layer must be fitted. 
Now the question arises as to which is the best and proper 
method for trimming the ends of the segments. Perhaps the oldest 
method is that of the “Chute Plane”. If a chute plane is not 
available, a substitute may be built as shown in Fig. 5, Plate 37. 
The plane, which operates in one position, that of a right angle to 
the face of the chute, is bound to trim the wood square as it cuts. 
A stop, adjustable to any angle, is placed on the board against 
which to butt the end of the segment, which also prevents the end 
grain from splitting. An adjustable clamp to hold the stock down 
on the chute is also furnished. It is important that the plane be 
kept sharp, and the edge ground straight and square with the side 
of the blade. Another bit of equipment generally found in a 
pattern shop is a “Trimmer”, a typical type of which is shown in 
Illus. 30. Trimmers may be had in many sizes, shapes, and styles 
for various kinds of work. The many features mentioned about 
the chute plane are to be found in the makeup of the trimmer. 
Pechaps it should be mentioned here that in many shops of today 
the disk sander has replaced to quite an extent the various uses of 
both the trimmer and the chute plane. In Illus. 31 is shown a 
modern sanding machine with both the disk and spindle combined. 
Stop and think of the many uses to which such a machine can be 
put with the adjustable tables and guides. 
Having adopted one of the above methods, the segments should 
be fitted end to end and the outside of the segment should come 
in line with the outside of the face plate. When the first layer is

fitted, the parts are coated with glue and toenailed along the inside 
edge to the face plate.™* 
  Illus, 31, 
Then the second layer is prepared and fastened to the first 
layer, this time braking the joint or building up the segments like 
“The instruction reads to glue the segments to the face plate, but this should 
be left to the judgment of the man in charge. Some prefer to glue paper between 
the first layer and the face plate, as a means of easily removing the rim when 
completed, while others prefer to have the work fastened to the face plate with screws.
-P-A-G-E-119
     A PuLtey 119   
a mason would build a brick wall, thus greatly increasing the 
strength of the rim. In like manner the third layer is fastened to 
the face plate. It would be well now to place several hand clamps 
on the work as an additional bit of assurance that the glued parts 
will hold securely. | 
While the first set of segments is drying, secure another face 
plate and prepare a second set in exactly the same manner. 
After the glue has dried, remove the clamps and nails and 
proceed to turn the rims to size and shape. The outside diameter 
of the rim will be 8%” and the inside 714”, as noted before.** 
It is now necessary to apply “Draft” to the rim, remembering 
that about 1%” to the foot of taper will be required on the outside, 
while considerable more than this will be necessary on the inside 
wall of the pattern. Round the outside corners slightly and finish 
up the surfaces with sandpaper. Then, with a cutting-off tool, 
remove the rim from the face plate, and prepare the other half of 
the rim in like manner.** 
Both halves still have one rough edge which must be trued up 
on the lathe. They are held on a face plate by “Chucking”. To 
chuck a half rim, prepare a face plate similar to the one which was 
used to build up the rim.** Turn the face plate to the shape shown 
in Fig. 10, so that the finished edge of the rim will fit the chuck as 
shown in Fig. 11, Plate 38. Note that at “X”, Fig. 10, Plate 38, a 
shoulder has been left which will act as a stop for the work and 
also center the rim to run true on the lathe. If the rim fits snug, 
the friction of it on the chuck should be sufficient to hold it in 
®Some pattern makers may prefer to build up the entire rim in one part first, 
so that they will have no trouble in turning the two halves to the exact size and 
getting both alike. In following this procedure, it may be advisable to place paper 
between the third and fourth layers, as a means of splitting the halves, or to use 
thicker segments for the third and fourth layers, allowing for cutting the rim in 
halves. 
S*If paper has been placed between the third and fourth layers they may be 
easily parted by introducing some thin edged tool as a plane blade. 
‘It will not be necessary to prepare a new face plate if the one from which the 
rim was prepared is in suitable condition.

surface should be tested with a straight edge. If O. K., this opera- 
tion should be repeated on the other half of the rim. 
After the rims are completed, the spokes and hubs should be 
prepared. However, this work need not follow the completion of 
the rims, but the stock may be prepared as soon as the segments 
are glued to the face plate. Eight pieces of 14” stock will be 
necessary for the spokes and two pieces for the hubs, specifications 
for which are shown in Figs. 14 and 15, Plate 38. The spokes are 
mitered and screwed to a face plate, as shown in Fig. 12, using the 
same face plate as was used for the rim. Face off the front of the 
face plate, if it seems necessary, and then locate. the exact center. 
With this center as a guide, locate and fasten the spokes to the 
face plate with screws, as shown in Fig. 13, Plate 38. The mitered 
ends of the spokes should be trimmed as required when fitting the 
segments. They are then coated with glue and placed back on the 
face plate.** They should be protected from the face plate by a 
sheet of paper. On top of the surface where all the four spokes 
meet glue a hub, the details of which will be found in Fig. 15, Plate 
38, and Fig. 18, Plate 39. It will be necessary to prepare two sets 
of thesé spokes and hubs. After they have been held in a clamp for 
several hours the face plate is put back on the lathe and the hub 
is turned to its proper diameter. In this operation small fillets are 
shaped at the base of the hub, as shown in Fig. 19, Plate 39. The 
hub is next turned to the correct length which will be equal to the 
width of the rim, minus the thickness of the spoke. In the center 
of the hub turn a small hole to receive a core print, as shown in Fig. 
19, Plate 39.5° The ends of the spokes are now cut for length on 
the face plate, using a sharp skew as shown in Fig. 19, Plate 39. 
‘When the thickness of the spokes permits, it is advisable to cut a groove along 
the mitred edge, and at the time the edges are glued together to insert splines, taking 
care to have the grain of the spline cross the joint. 
Two methods may be used to advantage in the boring of the hole to receive 
the core print. First the work may be done by using a small skew chisel; secondly 
a chuck may be introduced into tail stock spindle holding a bit of correct size, and 
as the work is revolving in the lathe the bit is fed into the hub.

The greatest care must be exercised to get the spokes to exactly fit 
the rim. See Fig. 20, Plate 39. 
When both sets of spokes have been cut to size, they are 
bradded together, as shown in Fig. 21, Plate 39. The shape of the 
spokes is laid out and the two are cut together, as shown in Fig. 
22, Plate 39. The edges are then rounded, as shown in a cross 
section, Fig. 22a, Plate 39. The two sets of spokes are then parted 
and glued into each rim respectively.*° 
The two parts of the pattern are now placed together. They 
may be brought together uniformly by arranging the two sets of 
spokes that were assembled at the time of shaping. This may be 
readily done by placing brads back in the original holes. Select a 
couple of centers on the spokes suitable for dowel pins, and bore 
two holes of a size suited to the dowels to be used. In boring do 
not penetrate through the spokes, but stop as soon as the spur: of 
the bit has penetrated to the outside. The dowel should now be 
glued into one-half of the spoke, and when dry the end should be 
sanded smooth with the surface of the spoke. 
It will be necessary to next prepare a set of core prints, the 
details of which are shown in Fig. 23, Plate 39. Note that one of 
the prints has been tapered and the other left straight. This is 
necessary as a protection to the mold after the core has been 
placed and the cope is about to be placed back on the mold. If 
the core were straight and also the recess in which it was to be 
received, and the core which had been placed in the mold had 
tipped a little, it would never have had an opportunity to be 
received in the recess. It would only have resulted in trying to 
penetrate into the top of the mold and would have ruined the same. 
However, with a tapered core entering into a tapered recess, the 
core can be tipped considerably and still enter the recess at the 
“This method of ea slening the spokes in the rim is used at this time to meet 
the elementary needs of the student. In advanced work it is advisable to use more 
rigid construction, an example of which is shown in the construction of a gear wheel, 
Fig. 1, Plate 47.

time the cope is being placed, owing to the width of the hole at 
_ the base as compared to the diameter of the core at the top. As 
the cope is lowered into place the tapered core is drawn into place. 
The above should be clear in the mind of the student, and both 
types of cores and core prints should be experimented with until 
the danger is made clear in the mind of the student. 
Again, in the commercial world, the core prints are often left 
loose on the pattern that they may be interchanged, and different 
sizes of cores placed in the mold at the same time using the same 
pattern. This is also true of the hubs on pulley patterns. A set of 
standard size hubs which may be interchanged and used with any 
size rim should be kept on hand. 
Prepare a simple, two-section core box as described early in the 
book. Finish the pattern with three applications of thin shellac. 
28—A PIPE ELBOW 
A pipe elbow represents a typical type of pattern in which 
special construction is used and which is duplicated on many other 
types of patterns. There is probably no other type of pattern 
about the shop which attracts more attention and causes the 
repeated question, “How was that made?” 
Before beginning the work, study the drawing (Plate 40) from 
the standpoint of the method of molding as well as its pattern 
construction. It is very evident that the hole through the center 
of the casting must be accomplished by introducing a baked core 
‘in the mold. This will necessitate the addition of core prints at each 
end of the pattern, as shown in Fig. 13, Plate 42, and a section of 
the mold with the core in place, Fig. 16, Plate 43. 
The pattern may be made in two halves, or solid, accompanied 
with a match or follow board. The instruction to follow will be 
for a split pattern. In the construction of the pipe elbow pattern, 
as shown in Fig. 13, Plate 42, five sections are used, each consisting 
of two pieces of stock.

We shall begin the pattern by preparing the body or quarter 
round of the elbow first. This is done on a face plate. Since the 
outside radius of the pipe is 414”, the diameter of a circle from 
which such a quarter section could be taken would be 8%”. Secure 
a piece of 34” stock, of suitable size, attach to a face plate and turn 
the same to 834”. This will allow 14” all around for final turning. 
On the inside of the pattern scribe a circle of 334” which will also 
allow a trifle for turning. At the same time locate the center of the 
plate while the work is rotating on the lathe, after which the plate 
may be removed from the lathe for further treatment. The surface 
of the plate is next divided into four equal sections through the 
center, marked as shown in Fig. 2, Plate 41. This divides the plate 
into four parts, each section containing an outline of the quarter 
round of the elbow. Next prepare one of the segments for the 
pattern. Secure a piece of 114” stock, which is enough for all of 
the segments, and in one corner of this lay out a segment following 
the dimensions given in Fig. 3, Plate 41, or work out the plan using 
the dimensions on the face plate. Cut out this segment, trim and 
test the ends to see if they are at 90 degrees to each other and that 
they fit the face plate. If the segment seems just right, use it as a 
template, mark out the other three, and then prepare them for the 
face plate. These segments may be fastened to the face plate with 
screws, as shown in Fig. 6. Before removing all of the segments, 
one,of them might be removed for inspection during the process of 
shaping. If the parts need further alteration, the segment can be 
set back in place and this alteration attended to. 
Place the work back on the lathe and turn it to 8%” on the 
outside and the segments to 4” on the inside, as shown in Fig. 6, 
Plate 41. Care must be taken to have these dimensions absolutely 
correct. 
The segments are next turned to shape. See Fig. 7, Plate 41. 
The work may be roughed out with a gouge and finished with a 
scraping tool or diamond point chisel. It is of utmost importance 
that the half round be absolutely round. It can only be checked up 
by using a template, as shown in Fig. 7a, Plate 41. This may be 
made of thin metal or cardboard. In finishing up the round it

' should be used constantly, removing only such parts as come in 
contact with the template, or as one would'say, removing the high 
' spots. When complete the template should fit the work perfectly. 
The work should now be well sanded and the segments removed 
from the face plate. In the construction of the pattern, as now © 
being described, only two of the four sections which have been 
removed from the face plate are used. Pick out the two pieces that 
appear to fit the best together. The sections should now appear as 
shown in Fig. 8, Plate 41. 
The flanges are next prepared. The drawing calls for flanges 
3%” thick when finished “f”, which will require 14” stock on the 
pattern. For the flanges secure four pieces of stock, 14"x41%4"x21%". 
The two edges that will come together on the pattern should be 
squared up. The face plate from which the quarter rounds have i 
just been removed may be used in the preparation of the flanges, . 
but it will first be necessary to freshly prepare the surface with a 
gouge and again true it up with a straight chisel. Again locate the 
center of the face plate and at this point brad the two pieces on, as 
shown in Fig. 10, Plate 42. By use of the scraping chisel these 
pieces may be turned to the diameter of the flange, with a 34” hole 
in the center** which will serve as a means of support for the pins 
attached to the core prints. It will now be necessary to apply a 
_ little draft to the flanges. Before removing from the lathe spin a 
2%4" circle with dividers on the flanges which will act as guide lines 
in attaching them to the elbow. They are now removed from the 
face plate and glued to the quarter round. Use the divider line as 
a guide, and put the two parts of the pattern together to see if the 
flanges and the elbow all are going to line up in their proper place. 
If so, apply the glue. It is advisable to size the end grain on the 
elbow with a thin coat of glue first, allowing it to stand several 
. minutes before giving it the final coat of glue.

Prepare a set of core prints next, as shown in Fig. 11, Plate 42, 
locating one dowel in each pair, or the dowels may be left out and 
same placed near the ends of the quarter round. The holes then 
should be accurately located by boring from the outside of the 
elbow, as instructed early in the work. In Fig. 11, Plate 42, three 
sets of core prints are shown, but for the present plan of the elbow 
only the two end ones are prepared, and their length is increased 
to two inches. The reason for this is that these core prints, which 
are not at the opposite ends of the pattern, will have to be regarded 
as balanced core prints and the total length of them made a trifle 
longer than the length of the core that rests inside of the mold. 
The hole for the pin of the core print may be extended into the 
quarter round, after which the prints are attached and appear as in 
Fig. 13, Plate 42.47 
To prepare a core box, secure a piece of 114” stock, 10” square 
and screw it central on a face plate. While the work is rotating 
on the lathe, spin off with the dividers two circles, one equal to the 
inside radius of the core and the other to the outside radius. 
Between these lines the stock will have to be removed to form a 
half round. The stock should be removed with a round nosed tool 
and checked with a template, as shown in Fig. 14, Plate 42. The 
block is then centered while on the lathe and through this center 
mark, divided into four equal parts. The block is then cut along 
these lines into four parts, one of which is only needed for this 
type of elbow. Two other sections are prepared that will shape 
the core to correspond to the core prints, and the box when com- 
pleted will resemble a portion of the one shown in Fig. 13, Plate 
42. A top and side view of the cope of the mold, with the core in 
place, is shown in Fig. 16, Plate 43. The core is supported at “D” 
ad “F”, and unless of sufficient length it is likely to sag in the 
mold at “E”. In other words, the section of the core lying in the 
recesses must over-balance the section in the mold, and again we 
have the type of core known as a balanced core. 
In the preparation of the pattern, as described above, a certain 
number of parts prepared must be thrown away. However, these

“The success of the finished pattern, which is composed of several parts, will 
depend largely on the skill and method used by the student in the assembly of the 
various parts. It is advisable to make an accurate layout of the elbow on a flat 
piece of wood, taking care that the piece is not warped pULe peachy, true when 
tested out on a surface plate. On this lay-out assemble one-half of the pattern and clamp in place until the glue has permanently hardened. The second half may be 
assembled in like manner or directly upon the first half of the pattern.

| parts are sometimes used to advantage, as will be noted. It will 
_ only be necessary to prepare a third set of core prints, as shown in 
' Fig. 11, Plate 42, and an extra set of flanges. The pattern, when 
assembled, appears as in Fig. 12, Plate 42. 
The advantages of this type of pattern may be noted in the 
view of the mold, Fig. 15, Plate 43, in which one can readily see 
that there is no danger of the core sagging as it rests on three 
points. Again in production work two elbows are produced with 
the same amount of work as is required to produce one in the 
‘previous method. 
Fig. 13, Plate ‘42, shows the construction of the core box 
required with the last type of pattern discussed. 
29—CAST GEARS 
Many types of machines are operated more or less by cast gears. 
These gears are used in the rough, so to speak, except for a general 
cleaning and grinding after their removal from the foundry. Since 
‘the outline of the gear is not trued up after being cast, it is of the 
utmost importance that it come as nearly perfect as possible. As 
the gear must be meshed with one or more other gears in its 
operation it will not run satisfactorily unless all gears are to a 
certain extent perfect. The cast gear will not be accurate unless 
the pattern is perfect, so that the responsibility aside from the 
draftsman lies with the pattern maker. 
It is not absolutely essential that a pattern maker be a designer 
of gears, although we find many young pattern makers anxious to 
learn all that is possible in the designing of gears. It is not the 
purpose of this lesson to instruct the student on the laying out of 
a gear, but merely how to transfer the gear from the drawing to 
the wood, and to explain the pattern construction that follows. 
A little light may be briefly cast on the theory of the curve 
of the tooth shown in the working drawing, Plate 44. In this 
drawing is given the pitch circle of the gear. Prepare a round 
block of wood of this diameter and lay it on a piece of paper. At 
any point on the circumference of the block tack a piece of string 
any length less than the circumference of the circle, having a 
pencil point attached to the other end of the string. Then hold 
the circular block tight on the paper, and moving the point of 
the pencil away from the circle, having the string tight at all

times, a curved line will result on the paper the correct shape of a 
gear tooth, as shown on the working drawing. 
To prepare a pattern for a cast gear for which a complete 
working drawing and all other data have been furnished, proceed 
as follows: Prepare the stock. On gear work the teeth should be 
made “End Grain” for every gear, which will probably necessitate 
the gluing together of several strips of wood in order to have a 
block with the grain running through it instead of across. Cut the 
block round on the band saw and attach stock to a face plate; then 
turn to the correct diameter and thickness of the gear, taking the 
diameter at the extremity of the teeth. The question now arises as 
to how the correct extreme diameter of the gear is found. For this 
refer to a handbook on gears. We find our gear of 12 teeth with a 
pitch circle of 6” has a D. P. equal to 2, which gives the addendum 
equal to %”. Our outside diameter will then be P. D.-6” plus 2 
XA. D.-%" or 7”. The side of the gear wheel is turned to shape, 
the work is then reversed and the other side finished as specified in 
the blue-print. While turning the piece, the hole for the pin of the 
core print is also cut in at the same time, so that it will be abso- 
lutely central on the pattern, as shown in the cross sectional view, 
Fig. 1, Plate 45. 
The piece is then removed from the face plate and divided into 
twelve equal parts, or as many parts as there are teeth on the gear. 
A template is next prepared, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 45. For 
this use a small strip of thin celluloid. Trimmings from an auto- 
mobile repair shop will serve excellently. Cut a strip slightly 
wider than the width of the tooth and down the middle scratch 
a center line. On the center line near one end push a pin through. 
At this point the strip of celluloid is pinned to the center of the 
working drawing and the scratch is made to be exactly over the 
center line on the drawing. With a sharp steel point trace the 
exact shape of the tooth on the celluloid, after which cut it to 
shape. If the edge is rough or uneven, scrape the same with the 
edge of a knife blade, after which place it back on the drawing 
and check the profile of the tooth. If the template becomes too 
small in the making, it is necessary that another one be prepared. 
The template is then placed on the gear blank, and the center line 
of the template is made to coincide with that on the wood. The 
end of the tooth should be exactly at the edge of the wood at 
which time the profile of the tooth is traced on to the blank with 
a sharply pointed knife. This operation is repeated on every 
center line until the entire circumference has been covered. 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  
     
-P-A-G-E-137
A Larce GEAR WHEEL 137   
The blank is then taken to the band saw, and the teeth are cut 
out as accurately as possible. Set the saw table to cut the proper 
amount. of draft. The cut should be made exactly on the line, 
leaving a shade of the knife mark to be seen all the way around the 
outline of the gear wheel. The teeth are now gone over carefully, 
are trued up with chisel or gouge, and finished with sandpaper, 
taking great care to keep the sides of the teeth square with the face 
of the pattern. It is next necessary to prepare a set of core prints, 
as shown in Fig. 6, Plate 45, and as shown in place on the pattern 
in Fig. 7, Plate 45. 
Complete the pattern with a two-piece core box as shown in 
Fig. 8, Plate 45. 
Special care must be taken in the foundry as in the pattern shop 
to produce a gear with all the teeth uniform. Up to this time in 
the molding of the patterns that have been made, the gateway has 
been cut into the wall of the mold. This is most undesirable in the 
case of a cast gear, as the entrance of the gate into the mold would 
have to be through one of the teeth. The molder overcomes this 
difficulty by introducing what is known as a horn gate. In using 
this type of gate, the metal is caused to flow first through the sprue, 
then down through the horn gate and up underneath the pattern 
into the bottom of the mold.** 
30—A LARGE GEAR WHEEL 
Patterns for large gear wheels are built up. That is, the rim 
is built up of segments and the spokes are set in the rim. Finally, 
the teeth are shaped separately and fastened to the rim, as will be 
noted in the instruction to follow. 
The procedure for building up the rim is similar to the building 
up of the rim for the pulley wheel, and will not be repeated in this 
lesson. If the thickness of the gear wheel is to be 1%”, it is 
advisable to use three layers of %4” stock. The spokes should 
be laid out along with the building up of the rim. At the 
time the second layer of the rim is being fitted the spokes 
should also be fitted into the rim, as shown in the cross section, 
Fig. 1, Plate 47. When satisfactory recesses have been made in the 
segments, the spokes are removed, and the last layer of segment is 
placed on the rim. These segments, however, are only partially 
glued on, and paper is glued between the rim and segments. It 
is only necessary to glue near the ends of the segments which will

hold sufficiently until the rim has been completed. In completing 
the rim it will be necessary to chuck the work to complete the 
other side. ‘ 
After completing the rim the last layer of segments is removed, 
and the spokes are set in. The segments are then put back in 
place and securely glued, after which the work is gone over with 
sandpaper. 
The rim is divided into as many parts as teeth are required on 
the wheel, and center lines are drawn, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 47. 
This completes the wheel except for the shaping and attaching of 
the teeth. It is now imperative that the pattern maker have a full 
size profile of one of the teeth, either prepared by the draftsman, 
or laid out by himself. The length of the stock for the teeth will 
be equal to the width of the rim, plus a small amount for trimming. 
The width and height of the stock may be estimated from the lay- 
out of the tooth, as shown by the lines drawn tangent to the sides 
of the tooth. At the base of the tooth the stock is made wide 
enough to include a small fillet in the shaping. Twenty-four of 
these blocks must be prepared, or as many as teeth are required on 
the wheel. A long, tapered strip may first be prepared and then 
cut into blocks, as shown in Fig. 5, Plate 47. These blocks are 
shaped in a jig operated by hand against a sand roller on the lathe. 
The jig is made from a solid block. Each end is laid out to the 
proper size and shape, after which it is worked to shape as shown 
in Fig. 5, Plate 47. The center portion is then cut out to receive 
the block for the tooth, thus avoiding the danger of getting either 
one or both ends of the jig to skew. It is well to make the jig out 
of maple which will hold up better under the friction to which it 
will be subjected. The inside of the jig should be about an inch 
or more longer than the blocks to be used for the teeth. Central 
through the base, a small hole is bored, of such diameter as to 
snugly receive the shank of a screw, suitable for holding the blocks 
in the jig (Fig. 7, Plate 47). The purpose of the screw is to hold 
the block tightly in the jig. However, one screw would not stop 
the block from rotating so it will be necessary to have in the base, 
a short distance to each side, a couple of brads penetrating a short 
distance through the block, as shown in Fig. 7, Plate 47. The block 
fastened in the jig and ready for treatment is shown in Fig. 8, 
Plate 47. 
The sand roller is next prepared from stock about 1%” in diam- 
eter. In the center of the roller cut a recess the depth of which is

equal to the thickness of the sandpaper. The width of the groove 
should be about 1%” more than the length of the blocks. In the 
groove glue some medium grade sandpaper. 
The outfit is then ready for use. The jig is brought up to the 
roller which is in operation on the lathe. The block is brought in 
contact with the sandpaper, but the templates are watched closely 
and only allowed to ride on the wood part of the roller. (Fig. 9, 
Plate 48.) Under this condition the block only cuts on the sand- 
paper until the template reaches the wood, at which time it ceases 
to cut. By the time the template has been allowed to reach the 
wood roller to the total length of its outline, the block will have 
been shaped accordingly. It may then be removed and another one 
treated in a similar manner, repeating until all the blocks have been 
shaped. 
The teeth are now fastened to the rim with long finishing nails 
or screws and glue, having the center line of the end of the tooth 
corresponding to that on the rim. In Fig. 3, Plate 47, it will be 
noted that the center lines have been carried across the rim with a 
square and then repeated on the other side as was originally laid 
out. 
The above method of joining the teeth on the pattern does not 
produce as strong a pattern as could be desired, but will serve the 
purpose when the pattern is not to be subjected to hard usage. 
For best results the teeth are dovetailed into the rim. This method 
may be the most easily developed by increasing the depth of the 
teeth say 14”, and decreasing the diameter of the rim in accordance 
—which would be 1%” less, in diameter than in the preceding me- 
thod. Between each block place a strip of wood the sides of which 
are tapered to fit the tooth block. These pieces are bradded and 
glued in place, as. shown in Fig. 11, Plate 48. For the time being 
the tooth blocks are left loose. However, each block is numbered 
and corresponding numbers are placed on the rim. The block may 
now be removed and placed in the jig and shaped. Fig. 12, Plate 
48, shows how the rim appears after all the blocks have been 
removed. 
After the teeth have all been shaped they are glued back into 
place.

  A BELL 143 
31—A BELL 
The pattern for a bell, as shown in Fig. 1, Plate 50, comes under 
the class of built-up patterns and is composed of segments con- 
structed in a manner similar to the method employed in the build- 
ing up of the pulley wheel. However, as the construction varies, 
the profile of the bell requires the use of segments of various sizes, 
as will be noted in the instructions to follow. 
Before constructing the pattern for the bell, the pattern maker 
makes a lay-out (Plate 49) on a thin board, full size with a shrink 
rule, and subdivides it into as many divisions as he will use layers 
of segments in its construction. Inside and outside the bell, the 
pattern maker estimates another line corresponding to the profile 
of the bell, but which will allow about 44” all over for trimming 
the pattern to shape. These divisions are then blocked off as 
shown in a section of the working drawing, Plate 49, allowing for 
trimming which will give the radii for each layer of segments, as 
shown in Figs. 5 to 11 inclusive, Plate 50. All the layers are then 
numbered in the order in which they will be glued to the bell. 
To begin the work on the bell secure a face plate and attach the 
same to a 34” piece of stock. This piece will not be a part of the 
bell, but of the face plate only. On this wooden face plate glue 
layer number one which will not be composed of segments, but 
a complete piece of wood the thickness and diameter of which will 
be taken from the first division as blocked off on the assembly 
drawing. Between this block and the face plate glue a sheet of 
paper that we may more easily remove the bell from the face plate 
later on. After the glue has set, the face plate is put back in the 
lathe and trued up. The face of the block is then rounded out con- 
cavely as specified in the drawing for the inside top of the bell, 
extending outward to the point where the first division line crosses 
the bell. The outside diameter is also turned true, avons 
to the outside diameter of the first section. 
The work is now removed from the lathe, and segments are 
prepared for three additional layers which are glued on as explained 
in previous lessons. While the segments are drying in place a 
template corresponding to the exact shape of the inside of the bell 
may be prepared from some very thin stock, or heavy card board, 
Fig. 3, Plate 50. 
As each layer of segments is glued on and turned true on the 
face, a line for the next row is put on. This is necessary since most 
of the layers have a different diameter.

As soon as three or four layers have been glued in place, the 
face plate is put on the lathe, and the inside is turned out to the 
exact size which may be checked by inserting the template while 
the work is at a standstill. So the work goes on; as the bell 
grows in size so does the size of the segments, the details of which 
are fully carried out in Figs. 5 to 9 inclusive, Plate 50. As soon 
as three or four additional layers have been glued in place, the 
inside is again turned to the exact size and shape. When the 
last layer is reached the shape is continued around the edge and 
cnto the outside surface, as shown in Fig. 13, Plate 50. The bell 
is then parted from the face plate, being forced off where the paper 
joins. Another piece of stock is now attached to the face plate 
about an inch larger than the base of the bell and is turned out 
so that the base of the bell may be chucked in, as shown in Fig. 14, 
Plate 51. 
It will be necessary to prevent the bell from flying out of the 
chuék by placing screws through the face plate into the base or 
rim of the bell, as shown in Fig. 14, Plate 51. It will now be 
necessary to prepare another template for the outside of the bell, 
then turn the outside to shape, as shown in Fig. 15, Plate 51. 
The pattern is then well sanded and removed from the chuck, 
the screw holes are filled up with beeswax, and the pattern is given 
several coats of shellac. 
To mold the bell, secure a flask having a drag of sufficient depth 
to accommodate all of the pattern. The drag is molded in the 
usual way, also the cope, except that sticks or metal rods are in- 
serted into the sand, which fills the inside of the bell. These project 
up into the sand that comes in the cope. The rods are called 
gaggers and their duty is to support the green sand core which 
will project far below the cope when it is lifted from the flask. 
The soldiers are coated with clay wash which causes the sand 
to adhere to them. In large floor work the soldiers are often 
fastened to the bars extending across the top of the flask. 
Another procedure in molding the pattern would be to prepare 
a match. The green sand core would then be formed in the drag. 
After the drag had been rolled over, the core would be left remain- 
ing on the bed of the mold, relieving it from the strain of being 
suspended in the air.

THe Trottey WHEEL 147 
For casting a bell special bronze is prepared to produce a clear 
ringing sound. It should consist of the following mixture: 
Copper, 76.5% ; Tin, 23.5%. 
32—THE TROLLEY WHEEL 
To mold a pattern it is sometimes necessary to use a flask con- 
taining three parts, called three-part molding. That we may have 
such a pattern for molding let us prepare a trolley wheel, such as is 
used on a street car, to make the electrical connection with the 
trolley wire (Plate 52). 
The construction of the pulley is practically all accomplished 
;on the lathe. The pattern will be a split one in the construction of 
which a special form of dowel, known as a “male” and “female” 
dowel, will be used. Secure two pieces of suitable stock, rough 
round on the band saw, and attach it to the face plate, shaping each 
piece separately, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, Plate 53. The two 
parts should be a tight fit. It will now be necessary to remove the 
face plate of the part with the male dowel, Fig. 2, and the part with 
the female dowel, Fig. 3, should be chucked. Now the outside of 
the pattern may be shaped so far as possible. Since both sides of 
the trolley are of an exact shape, it will be well to use a template 
as shown in Fig. 3. The work is well sanded and the part removed. 
Now the other half of the pattern must be chucked in another 
piece and the outside of it shaped, as shown in Fig. 4. It is also 
sandpapered and removed from the chuck. 
The pattern is thei finished with several coats of thin shellac. 
In molding the pattern it is advisable to prepare a third part of 
the flask for the mold which is knowh-as the “Cheek” or “Inter- 
' mediate Part”! The depth of the cheek should correspond to the 
thickness of the pattern, and the length and width to the“outside 
dimensions of the flask. To support the sand in the cheek it will be 
necessary to run bars across, allowing enough space between to 
accommodate the pattern. See Fig. 6, Plate 53. It will also be 
necessary to have a guide pin connecting the cheek with the cope. 
“With skilled hands it is possible to mold the trolley wheel in a two-part flask. Reference for such a procedure: ‘Modern Shop Practice,” Vol. 5, Pages and 58,

and drag. If the process of molding the trolley wheel is to be 
repeated often, it will be advisable to get an extra set of metal 
flask pins and eyes so that all the parts may be properly adjusted 
before using. 
The molding operations begin with the cheek, as shown in Fig. 
6, Plate 53. Before ramming the sand down hard, it is advisable to 
tuck the sand in the groove with the fingers. Enough sand is now 
removed so that the entire face of the pattern may be seen. Part- 
ing sand is then applied to the molding sand and the drag is placed 
and molded, as in Fig. 7, Plate 54. A bottom board is then placed, 
the flask is rolled over, and the cope is prepared in the same 
manner, removing such sand as will allow the pattern to be exposed 
as before. 
In the removal of the pattern the cope is lifted off to allow for 
the removal of the first half of the pattern. The cheek is then 
removed to permit the removal of the second half of the pattern. 
All of these operations are illustrated in Figs. 8,9 and 10, Plate 54. 
The trolley wheel can be molded in a two-part flask by the 
introduction of a baked core in the mold. Instead of a groove on 
the pattern, a round core print extending out half an inch or more 
will be necessary. 
33—A PROPELLER BLADE 
The construction of the blade for a propeller such as is used to 
drive a boat through the water is not as difficult as one might 
think upon first inspection of the pattern. Generally the blade is 
not carved from a large block of wood, but is built up of segments 
radiating around a pivot, giving the blade the important and 
absolutely correct curve. There is one item which the pattern 
maker must know along with his working drawing, and that is 
the correct pitch of the blade. It is not the purpose of this instruc- 
tion to analyze the theory of development of the blade from the 
standpoint of design, but merely to give the student the procedure 
for laying out the blade when furnished the drawing and other data. 
In the working drawing are given all the details necessary 
(Plate 55). That the same may be a little clearer to the student 
the drawing has been reproduced in Fig. 1, Plate 56, and shaded to 
bring out the shape of the blade, etc. Secure a thin board and 
reproduce the drawing in full size from the dimensions given,

using a shrinkage rule. In the end view three items of importance 
are necessary. Be sure to include in your full size drawing an 
outline of the hub, an outline of a cross section of the blade where 
it joins onto the hub, and a cross section of the blade across its tip. 
All of these are shown in the working drawing and again in Fig. 1, 
Plate 56. It is around these sections of the blade that the size and 
shape of the segments are computed. 
When the drawing is completed, we should have in our end 
view, Fig. 1, Plate 56, an oblong, the height and width of which 
corresponds to the height of the hub and the width of the oblong 
corresponding to the extreme width of the blade. This oblong 
should now be divided into as many divisions as it is deemed advis- 
able to have segments in the pattern. In the case of this special 
blade eight segments are recommended. The eight segments are all 
similar in shape to the one shown in Fig. 3, Plate 56, except that 
they vary in dimensions. In laying out the blades the drawing 
_ must be analyzed, and each division of the drawing must be used - 
_ separately, as shown in Fig. 3, Plate 56, for each segment as it is 
' laid out. To lay out the first segment, Fig. 3, Plate 56, it is neces- 
sary to get a piece of stock for which eight pieces have previously 
been prepared. The thickness of the stock must be one-eighth of 
the total height of the hub, 214”, the width equal to the width of 
the hub at the widest part, and the length equal to the diameter of 
the hub, plus the length of the blade. Gage a center line the 
length of the piece and at one end construct a circle the diameter 
of which is equal to the largest diameter of the hub which appears 
in section 1, or the radius as shown by “AB” in Fig. 2, Plate 56. 
With the center used for drawing the hub on the segment scribe 
another circular line at the other end of the segment, setting the 
compass a shade longer than the radius of the blade or 5%”. On 
this line lay off a distance equal to EF, Figs. 2 and 3, Plate 56. 
Next lay off a section adjoining the hub on the segment equal to 
the cross section, as shown by “CD” in Figs. 2 and 3, and the 
width of the blade at the extreme end as shown by “EF” in Figs. 
2 and 3, Plate 56. Connect these points and round the corners 
adjoining the hub which will supply the material for forming the 
fillet where the blade adjoins the hub. At the end of the segment 
scratch a line to designate the exact location where the second

segment will join the first at the point where they are glued 
together. 
In laying out the other segments the same procedure takes 
place, but one must not be confused because the views of the cross 
section of the blade do not fall as conveniently or distinctly as 
they did in the first section. Fig. 3, Plate 56, illustrates, by separat- 
ing the sections, just what is furnished in the working drawing. 
After all the segments have been marked out similar to the first 
one, a small hole, corresponding to whatever dowel rod one may 
have on hand, is bored central in the hub of each segment, and the 
pieces are carefully cut to shape as shown in the Illus. 32. 
  Illus. 32. Illus. 33. 
The pieces are now carefully assembled on a dowel rod (Illus. 
33), and swung around the dowel until each segment is brought 
into its proper place, which can be noted by the mark at the end 
of the segment. The pieces are then clamped (which may be 
found to be a little awkward), but if carried out as shown in Illus. 
32 and 33, not much trouble should be encountered. If the clamp- 
ing is found to be successful the clamps should be carefully re- 
moved, taking care not to get them out of adjustment: The seg- 
ments are then parted and coated with glue, and again assembled 
and clamped as in the trial operation. If clamping is not successful, 
toe-nail the pieces. 
When the glue sets, the clamps are removed and the blade is 
worked to shape. For this use a sharp spoke or draw shave; if
-P-A-G-E-156

necessary a wood rasp. The surface may lastly be finished to 
advantage on a small sand roller on the lathe. It is of advantage 
in the beginning of the work to see that only straight grain wood 
is used. 
“If a three-blade propeller is being prepared, it will be necessary 
to build three single blades complete, each with a hub. After they 
are completed, each hub is cut in exactly the same location, at an 
angle of 120°degrees. The three blades are then glued together 
after which the hub is given a final treatment. The pattern is then 
given several coats of thin shellac. 
As a test for one’s advancement in the art of molding the 
propeller serves as an excellent project. Before forming the cope, 
the sand must be sharply cut away from the top edge of one blade 
to the bottom of the next, so that the propeller is in position in the 
mold that it can be removed without disturbing any of the sand 
about it, the same condition to apply relative to the shaping of 
the cope. In the shaping of the cope large projections of sand are 
formed which suspend from the bottom of the mold when it is 
lifted. It will be necessary to reinforce these with soldiers as 
noted in a previous lesson.

34—BRASS FURNACE 
In these days of great world progress the study of metal has 
become one of great importance, and that importance should not 
be overlooked in connection with the study of pattern making and 
foundry work. To properly accomplish this end many schools in 
the country ought to have, and keep in constant use, at least, a 
brass furnace. The interest taken in and the benefit derived from 
such an investment in the pattern shop will be greatly increased 
if the student has the opportunity actually to produce metal cast- 
ings for himself. Again, such a furnace is practical, as in most 
cases it will produce sufficient heat to melt iron. Many an item 
of expense may be saved the school in the way of repairs, building 
equipment, etc., not to mention the convenience of being able to 
turn out work at the moment’s notice. 
There are two things to be considered before undertaking to 
build such a furnace. Is the school chimney high enough to pro- 
duce sufficient draft and, secondly, will there be enough room about 
the furnace conveniently to carry on the work? The pit in which 
the furnace is to be located should be at least five feet away from 
the wall and the same amount or more on each side. The pit 
should be about 30” in depth and lined with brick. The cover for 
the pit, which is built in three sections, should be made of number 
three gauge sheet iron. Numereous holes about 14” in diameter 
should be drilled in the front two sections to allow a free passage 
of air through the furnace. Angle irons should be riveted on, 
. about 2” in from the edge, to hold the cover in place on the pit, as 
shown on the drawing. 
The metal drum that surrounds the wall of the furnace should 
be ordered from some boiler works. It should be 36” in height and 
23%” in diameter. The seam will come to the front, with rivets 
about 2” apart. At the rear 314” from the top there will have to be 
a 7¥4” square opening, to accommodate the pipe connection. 
The fire brick, which must be ordered “special” from the dealer, 
are wedge shape and should fit snugly together. Specifications 
will be found on the assembly drawing, Plate 57. The patterns

for the castings are all simple in 
construction and can be built in any 
school shop. Use good, dry lum- 
ber and take every precaution 
against warping. It is not neces- 
sary to machine the castings, but 
should it be desired, finish marks 
will be found on the drawings. 
The top plate patterns “C”’, may 
also be used for the bottom plates 
except that the lugs will not be 
needed and about 1414” of the front 
flange must be removed to allow 
the entrance of the grate bars. 
This can be accomplished by filling 
in these parts with molding sand 
after the pattern has been with- 
drawn from the sand. To get a 
satisfactory pipe connection casting 
it will be necessary to prepare a 
core box and core out the inside. 
There should be no trouble in 
assembling the parts if the “as- 
sembly drawing” is carefully fol- 
lowed. Before bolting on the top 
mite: ef: plate it will be necessary to line the 
drum with fire brick. In laying the 
third and top layer, care must be taken to fit the brick around the 
pipe connection.’ Before placing the top plate, a layer of fire clay 
will be necessary to make a tight or snug connection. Have a tin- 
smith prepare a good, strong elbow of galvanized iron to connect 
the pipe leading to the chimney. 
If the drawing has been followed and the parts assembled to 
the last detail the furnace will now be ready for use. Before we 
can carry out a heat we will need other apparatus. In the mean- 
time, order in serial No. 30 crucibles and a pair of “tongs” and 
“shanks” to fit this size of crucible. 
To start the fire see that the grates are properly in place. Use 
some old newspapers and some kindling wood and ignite. After

the fire has a good start throw on two scuttles of foundry coke. 
It will be necessary to buy the best possible lump foundry coke. 
Do not order the crushed, but crush the lump yourself to get the 
best results. While the coke is getting a start prepare the.pot; 
that is, if it is to be brass weigh in the copper and throw on some 
charcoal. Now set the pot down in the furnace and pack coke 
‘around it. If the crucible is new and has never been tempered 
it will be necessary to start with a slow fire; that is get the pot in
-P-A-G-E-163
  Brass FurRNACE 163   
as soon as you are sure the coke has a start and add coke as noted 
before. After the pot has been through a heat it will be in a 
different condition than before. (The foundryman would say that 
it has been “tempered”.) 
The handling and running of the furnace will improve with 
time. Do not make the mistake of constantly looking in and 
poking at the coke. It might be added that the less one fools 
with the furnace after the fire is going and the pot set, the 
better and faster will be the results. When you notice the 
top of the furnace turning to a red heat then you will know 
your metal is at the melting point. When the copper has melted 
add the tin and zinc. Numerous brass formulas will be found in 
the “American Machinery Handbook” and others. The charcoal 
will prevent the zinc from passing off in fumes. Throw in a hand- 
ful of “rosin” for a flux and stir well. Be careful, as the rosin 
will flame up with a powerful heat. 
Now the pot is ready for hoisting. If the pot contains only a 
few pounds it may be lifted out with a pair of long-handled pincers 
that ought to be included in the equipment. Later you will melt 
a pot full of iron, seventy pounds or more, and the job of hoisting 
is no fun unless it is gone after in a systematic manner. Prepare 
2 bar with two feet of chain and a hook attached, as shown in 
Illus. 34. There will also be needed an eye on the tongs to catch 
the hook. Now after the pot has been loosened from the coke 
bed and room has been made, drop in the tongs with chain attached. 
A boy will be needed at each end. of the bar to do the hoisting, 
while the man at the tongs will only have to guide it out and set 
it in the shank. Near at hand should be a sand bed, say 3’ square 
and 5” deep. Here they will carry the pot to do the skimming. 
Prepare a skimming rod from a bar of iron about 1” wide, 4” thick 
and about 4 long. Bend it slightly round at the skimming end. 
While pouring, keep the skimming rod near the front of the pot 
and hold steady. We shall need a boy with a long hook at the 
back to keep the pot from dropping out of the shank as we near 
the énd of the supply of metal. Also have a few boys handy with 
shovels of sand to throw on any molds that should leak. 
After the furnace cools, withdraw the grates and from above, 
with a long iron bar, poke out the remaining ashes that will have 
caked over the grates.  
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 Woop PATTERN MAKING   
If the brass heat proves successful, fill a pot with iron scraps 
and proceed as before, only have the pot well covered with coke 
before you put on the cover and let her go. In about an hour and 
a half or two hours after the fire has been started with good coke 
a pot full of iron can be brought to a white heat. If the iron 
melts successfully order in a few hundred pounds of pig iron. 
After the pot has been filled with scrap and sprues and placed in 
the furnace, on top of this the writer sets a pig or two and holds 
it in place with coke. If carefully placed, it will run down into 
the pot as it melts. 
The furnace improves with age, and the continual cleaning and 
poking around after a heat increases the size to advantage at the 
melting zone. If the fire does not draw properly it may be that 
opening a window or a door will help materially.

The most common means of melting iron in the foundry is 
the cupola as shown in Plates 60 and 61. The cupola as illus- 
trated is constructed of sheet iron, ranging from 3/16” to 3%” in 
thickness. This metal shell (2) is lined with special fire brick (1). 
The bricks may be arranged to form either a single or double lining. 
Near the bottom. of the cupola is an outer chamber known as the 
wind belt (16). The forced draft, which is used in the cupola and 
created by a fan, enters the wind belt through a pipe (4). As the 
air circulates around the chamber, it is warmed before it enters the 
cupola through the tuyeres (5 and 6). In direct line with the tuyeres 
and in the casing of the wind belt are openings known as peep holes 
(15). The peep holes may be uncovered and a bar introduced into 
the tuyere if found necessary. At the bottom of the cupola is a

bar (10). Should the metal or slag back up through the tuyere, it 
may be removed by opening up the wind belt at the sections indi- 
cated as No. 19 in the drawings. 
To operate the cupola it is first necessary to prepare the lining. 
Upon inspection it will be found that a certain amount of slag has 
adhered to the wall of the lining. The amount of refuse that has 
clung to the wall and the condition of the wall in general, especially 
in the melting zone, will depend to a large degree upon the success 
with which the previous heat was carried out. For removing this 
refuse special hand picks of the form shown in Illus. 36, are used.

should take care not to remove any of the glaze. If the cupola has 
bunged up so as to make it impossible to enter, it will be neces- 
sary to force a hole through it with a long bar and sledge. 
After the wall has been freed of refuse, it will be found that 
one section of the wall has worn away. This section of the cupola 
is known as the melting zone, and will be found to lie from 14 to 
20 inches above the tuyere, occupying an area from 4 to 6 inches 
in width. This section of the wall which has been cut away by the 
-last must be relined. For this we may use fire clay and sharp 
sand, preparing a mixture that will crack as little as possible. This 
mixture can only be satisfactorily arrived at by experiment. It 
might be well to start with equal parts of clay and sand. In apply- 
ing the clay care should be taken not to decrease the diameter of 
the cupola at this point nor should it be allowed to exceed 34” in
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 Woop PatrerRN MAKING 
thickness. Any holes which have been made elsewhere in the 
lining should also be filled in. If the opening is large it is advis- 
able to embed pieces of fire brick in the clay.* 
Having finished the work on the lining, the bottom door is 
closed up and propped with a bar (10). It is advisable to take 
some clay and seal up the inside cracks, thus preventing the sand 
of the bottom from running out after it becomes dry. The bottom 
(9) of the cupola is next prepared with sand. In mixing the sand 
one must aim to get a mixture that is weak enough to fall apart 
when the bottom door is dropped and still have enough binder in it 
to withstand the pressure of the molten metal. For this, common 
sand mixed with some molding sand will do. The sand should be 
well mixed to the consistency or temper of molding sand. It is 
well riddled and passed into the cupola through the breast hole (7). 
After enough sand has been filled in the bottom, it is given the 
proper slope as indicated in the sketch Plate 61, and rammed down 
as in the procedure of making a mold. The slope is tapered to 
meet desired conditions, but it is advisable not to make it too 
steep. % 
a cdkie completed the bottom of the cupola, the breast hole is 
thoroughly brushed out and coated with clay water and a handful 
of wet clay rubbed on the bottom. In this is placed a round bar 
which is to shape the opening through which the metal will leave 
the cupola. The bar should vary from 34” to 1%” according to the 
size of the opening wanted. It should be placed so as to be in line 
with the bottom of the cupola just completed. About the bar 
several pieces of coke, that have been coated with clay, are placed 
and so on until the entire opening has been filled, after which the 
bar is withdrawn and the front of the breast as well as the open- 
ing is dressed with clay. The clay used should be mixed with sharp 
sand as was used in the daubing of the wall of the cupola. Havy- 
ing completed the breast the spout is also faced off with the same 
mixture of clay. On top of the spout and up against the breast, 
place some live coal, continuing this operation up to the time the 
blast is turned on. 
In starting the heat it is first necessary to place some material 
in the bottom of the cupola that will be easily ignited. Throw 
some oily waste near the tap hole and on it some shavings. Then 
some light dry wood. The material will have to be dropped down 
*It is not good practice to use very much sharp sand in the cupola daub. It fuses 
too easily and runs down, causing a great deal of work in picking out. There is a 
preparation on the market known as “Hightempite or Lava Patch” which fuses at a, 
high degree of heat. After using this, very little daubing is required.
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  THE CupoLa 169   
from the charging door and care must be taken not to injure the 
sand bottom. A flame from a torch or oily rag is placed in front 
of the tap hole. The material in the cupola should readily ignite. 
When well started, about one-half of the coke for the bed is thrown 
in, and when this is well ablaze the balance of the bed is thrown 
on. As soon as all the fuel has burnt up evenly the cupola is 
ready for charging. The time required for preparing the bed 
for charging should consume from 2 to 3 hours. In this time the 
walls of the cupola have a chance to become thoroughly heated to 
the temperature of the fire. 
The height of the coke bed should be about 22” above the 
tuyere. If the bed is at this height. and all aglow it is ready for 
charging. Before one starts to charge a cupola he should estimate 
the amount of coke and iron required for the various layers that 
go to making up the charge of coke and iron. If too much fuel is 
used the melting will gradually take place above the melting zone, 
and if too little is used it will gradually take place below the melt- 
ing zone and result in sluggish iron. The results can only be 
accurately arrived at after several heats. Whether too little or 
too much fuel is being used may be determined by observing the 
charge of the melting zone after the heat. To first determine 
the charge measure up the diameter of your cupola and with a 
blackboard compass draw a circle on the floor the same. size. 
Around this build a wall of brick about 5” in height, which is an 
average height of the melting zone of the cupola. Fill this basin 
with coke and level off, then remove the coke and weigh it. This 
amount of coke will melt approximately 10 times this amount of 
iron. For instance, if the amount of coke required for a charge on 
top of it is found to be 40 pounds, it will be necessary to throw in 
about 400 pounds of iron. With this as a basis for estimating, the 
cupola may now be charged. If the cupola is a small one, the 
pigs of iron should be broken into several pieces. Care should 
be taken in throwing them into the cupola not to injure the lining 
and to keep them as close together as possible. Place the smallest 
pieces of iron on top of the larger ones so as to produce a uniform 
mixture. If the scrap is dirty or the heat is to be a long one, it 
will be necessary to draw the slag out through the slag hole. 
The slag may be rendered more fluid by fluxing with lime- 
stone, oyster shells, chalk or marble, The flux may be added to
-P-A-G-E-170
  
170 Woop PATTERN MAKING   
the charges of iron after the first or second charge has been thrown 
in, The amount will vary with the condition of the scrap since it 
takes from 1 to 3 per cent of flux to that of the weight of iron. 
The slag must be watched and not allowed to get up near the 
tuyere as the cool air will cause it to harden, blocking up the tuyere, 
stopping the efficiency of the blast and consequently the melting 
of the metal. 
      iss 
Bott: 
Illus. 37. 
Having charged the cupola, the blast is next turned on, and 
the hole in the breast left open and closely watched. If the bed 
has been prepared to the correct level, the first signs of iron will 
come in three or four minutes. At first the iron is cold and slug- 
gish and must be watched closely and kept moving. The iron 
gradually gets hotter and hotter, and in about eight minutes should 
be running a stream sufficiently hot and plentiful so that the hole 
may be stopped up. For stopping up the hole, the cupola man 
uses round pieces of iron known as bott sticks and shown in Illus. 
37; varying in diameter from 4” to 1”, and several feet in length. 
To the end of the bott stick is attached a bott. These botts 
are generally made of clay and should be as friable and dry as 
practicable. If clay is used it may be mixed with a part of saw 
dust or sea coal. Molding sand and fire clay, or even new molding 
sand dipped in a heavy clay wash may be used. Before starting 
the blast a number of botts should be prepared and several kept 
attached to the bott sticks at all times during the tapping opera- 
tions. To remove the bott from the tap hole a round pointed iron 
bar as shown in Illus. 38, is used, starting around the outside of the 
Illus. 38. 
bott to loosen same. Never insert the bar directly in the center of 
the bott as this only tends to wedge the bott tighter into the hole.
-P-A-G-E-171
    
THE Cupona 171 
As soon as the metal is flowing freely, dip the end of the rod in 
cold water to temper same, which will keep it in good condition. 
In front of the spout and resting on some support such as a 
pair of saw horses, have your large ladle all ready to catch the 
metal as it rushes out of the cupola. As soon as the metal nears 
the top of the ladle the tap hole must be stopped up with a bott as 
noted before. During the process of preparing the cupola bed and 
up to the time of charging, fire should constantly be kept burning 
in the ladles or they should be filled with red hot coals. If this 
is not done the walls of the ladle will be so cool as to freeze the 
metal as soon as it is run into the ladle. 
When the last of the metal has passed out of the cupola the 
bottom must be dropped at once. To do this the bar of iron which 
has been supporting the bottom must be either pulled or knocked 
down with a long bar or hook. If the bottom has. been of the 
right temper it should readily fall from the cupola. The refuse 
should then be cooled off by sprinkling with water. | 
36—MACHINE CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND GEN- 
ERAL SHOP EQUIPMENT 
On Pages 15 to 31 inclusive there is given a list of machines 
and tools used in a pattern shop. A great deal is said about the 
care of the various machines, but nothing about their construction 
and operation. The construction and methods of operation will, 
therefore, be discussed in this chapter. 4 
Band Saw 
The Band Saw, Illus. 39 and 40, is perhaps one of the machines 
most frequently used. It varies greatly in size and range of work. 
In a good machine the wheels are perfectly balanced and the outer 
surface is cushioned with rubber upon which the band saw rides. 
Thelower wheel in the machine is stationary, that is, it has a 
positive, non-changing alignment with the frame of the machine. 
The upper wheel has a vertical screw adjustment for tensioning 
the saw, and a tilting device for tracking the saw on the wheel. 
If the top wheel is not exactly in line with the lower wheel, the 
saw will run off. The saw, while running, passes through the 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 Woop PatrERN MAKING 
center of the saw table which is so constructed that it may be 
tilted at any angle with the saw blade. In putting on a new saw, 
it must pass through a slot on the table. This slot weakens the 
table and any weight upon it will throw it out of line. To over- 
come this difficulty, a pin is inserted at the front end of the slot. 
In setting the saw table at any angle, the operator is guided 
  Illus. 39 Illus. 40 
by a dial on the front of the machine which indicates the angle in 
degrees. This is of great advantage when cutting a pattern as it 
enables the operator to apply the correct amount of draft while 
cutting. The adjustable table also affords an opportunity to cut 
any desired angle required in the construction of the pattern. 
Aside from cutting wood to shape, the band saw ‘is also used 
when resawing lumber. For this purpose a heavy saw and special 
attachments are furnished. 
Saws for the machine may be purchased in several widths and 
thicknesses. The narrower the saw the less set will be necessary 
when cutting small circles. The saw should always be kept sharp. 
The filing may be done by hand or on a specially designed machine,
-P-A-G-E-173
  Bann Saw 173   
as shown in Illus. 41. This machine has an attachment for setting 
the saw. | 
~ Sooner or later a saw will break, but this does not mean that 
it must be discarded. With a little skill and the proper equipment, 
the saw is soon welded together again. First, the ends of the 
saw are lapped after they have been filed to fit. The lapping of 
one tooth is all that is necessary, and in order to have a correct 
setting one tooth must be cut away. In welding, a special saw 
  Illus. 41 
clamp, as shown in Illus. 
42, is required. After the 
saw is clamped in place, 
the ends are bound rigidly 
together with fine wire. 
For brazing the joint, fine 
brass filings, together with 
some powdered borax, 
which acts as a flux and 
causes the brazing to stick, 
are placed on top of the 
joint. Then a torch con- 
nected with the machine,     Illus, 42 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
174 Woop Patrern MAKING 
or an electrical heating attachment, or a blow torch, is applied to 
the joint until the saw turns red and the filings have melted. The 
flame is then removed and in a moment the saw has cooled and is 
ready for filing. When filing care should be taken to get the thick- 
ness uniform with the rest of the saw. A suitable file should be 
selected. A file that is too fine will quickly clog up with the soft 
metal used in brazing. 
A saw rarely breaks again in the same place. The temper 
having been removed through heating, the teeth will not very long 
retain a sharv edge, but the metal has become soft and tough. 
Accidents from breaking saws very rarely happen as most saws 
are guarded, as shown in Illus. 39 and 40. 
The question as to what causes a band saw to break is often 
asked. Ifa saw is kept sharp, properly set, and free from friction, 
there will be little danger of breaking a saw. If a saw is allowed 
to become dull, there will be considerable friction which causes 
heat and in time the saw will become case hardened and brittle. 
If short on “set”, the operator is liable to pull the saw off when 
removing his work, thus badly bending or cracking the blade, and 
sometimes breaking it. At the rear of the saw is a small wheel, 
Illus. 43, upon which the saw rides, and 
which is placed there to prevent friction. 
If this wheel is not properly oiled, it will 
not run at full speed or stop entirely. 
The saw will, therefore, slip over the 
surface, thus causing friction. This fric- 
tion will heat the saw which will eventu- 
ally become case hardened and brittle and 
thus will be easily broken. 
  Illus. 43. 
Vertical Hollow Chisel Mortiser 
The Mortising Machine, Illus. 44, performs its work by means 
of a hollow chisel, a form of tool now almost universally used for 
all kinds of mortising operations. A high speed bit revolves 
within this chisel which bores a round hole, and at the same time
-P-A-G-E-175
  
CuiseL Morriser 175   
, Temoves the chips thus 
| bored as well as those 
cut out by the corners 
of 'the’chisel. - These 
mortising machines cut 
rapidly due to the high 
bit speed possible with a 
supporting chisel, and 
are readily adapted to 
any shape of mortise, or 
any length or practical 
depth. 
A foot feed machine 
is usually operated with 
tools from %4” to 5%” 
square, although some- 
what larger tools can be 
fed in woods not ex- 
cessively hard. 
The vertically reciprocating plunger carries the bit spindle 
with its drum driving pulley and also the chuck which holds the 
chisel. Its movement is controlled by foot lever, and the length 
of the stroke is adjustable according to the work. The return 
movement is accelerated by spring pressure. The foot lever is also 
adjustable in length and the belt pulley is guarded.    ae ce

Motor Head Speed Lathe 
The Motor Head Speed Lathe, Illus. 46, represents the very 
latest development in alternating current motor driven lathes. All 
belting and pulleys have been eliminated; the motor takes the 
place of the head stock, and the rotor shaft of the motor becomes
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 Woop PatTERN MAKING

the head stock spindle. Ample power, safety to the operator, flex- 
ibility, and elimination of operating troubles are among the promi- 
nent features of this lathe. 
  Illus, 47
-P-A-G-E-177
  Saw Bencu 177   
Two kinds of head stocks have been developed, a four speed 
motor head, and an adjustable speed motor head. In the latter the 
speeds range from 600 to 3600 rotations per minute. The entire 
controlling mechanism is regulated in the motor. 
The Saw Bench 
A large portion of the saw work in the pattern shop is done 
on a Saw Bench. We find in this machine, as in all others, that 
better service and more conveniences are to be found in the better 
or higher priced machines. For instance, in the cheaper machine 
the operator must remove the saw and install another one when 
changing from a cross-cut to a ripping operation, etc. In the 
more expensive machines these two saws are combined, as shown in 
Illus. 47. A small sized saw bench, 
Illus. 48 and 49, convenient for small 
work, is generally installed on a table 
near the work bench. It is economical 
to operate and saves wear and tear on 
the large machine. 
a S A variety of operations is made pos- 
Illus. 48 sible by the tilting of the saw table and 
the setting of the saw guide at any angle, as shown in Illus. 49. 
Primarily the machine is used for ripping and cross-cutting 
stock, as well as for cutting miters. In addition to these opera- 
tions, the machine is used for cutting grooves, making dadoes and 
rabbets. In pattern work it is used extensively for roughing out 
    Illus, 49

be performed.

  Illus. 50 shows a rip saw as used on the saw table, while Illus. 
51 is a cross-cut saw for the same machine. The only difference 
is in the shape of the teeth. Illus. 52 shows a saw which is used 
for cutting grooves. It resembles the rip saw very closely, but the 
thickness of the saw is equal to the groove desired. Such saws 
may be purchased in any standard width up to about 3”. When 
a groove saw is desired for a groove beyond this width, it will be 
necessary to use the rabbeting saw, Illus. 53. 
The dado head, which is another type of saw for cross-cut 
work, is a study in itself. There are many varieties of these saws 
on the market) Illus. 54 shows a well-known make cf one of these 
heads. Note the construction. (it is built up of several saws. The 
outer saws, which cut the edge of the groove, are composed of two 
sets of teeth; that is, a combination of both “rip” and “cross-cut.” 
   Tilus. 54,  
-P-A-G-E-179
Hanp PLANER AND JOINTER 179   
This enables the operator to 
use the head with or against 
the grain of the wood. Between 
the two outside cutters are a 
number of cutters which rake 
out the material in the groove. 
The saw can be built up to any 
thickness, in units of sixteenths 
of an inch, by installing any 
aumber of these “rakes.” 
Illus. 55 shows still an- 
other form of adjustable dado 
head. 
  Illus. 55 
Hand Planer and Jointer 
Illus. 56 shows a Hand Planer and Jointer. Perhaps the fore- 
most operation of the planer is to remove “wind” from a piece 
of stock. After this is done, the stock may be run through the 
  Illus. 56 
surface planer and then it will be of an exact thickness and per- 
fectly true. The next important operation of the planer is the 
squaring up or “jointing” of the edges of two or more pieces of 
stock which are about to be glued together. The planer is also 
used for beveling edges or chamfering corners. 
One of the features of the planer, shown in Illus. 56, which 
is probably not to be found in any other planer, is the adjustable 
bed upon which the stock rests and over which it passes before 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  180 Woop Patrern MAKING   
it comes in contact with the planer knives. The adjustment allows 
the bed to take any angle with the cutting knife, and the angle is 
then indicated on the dial at the front of the machine. The pattern 
maker can thus take a board 18” wide, and by setting the table, 
plane this board, at the same time giving it the proper amount of 
draft the entire width of the piece. 
  Tlus. 57. 
Another operation that can be performed on the planer is the 
tapering of stock with its length. As an example, it might become 
necessary to taper a piece of stock 24” long so that one end will 
be 3” and the other 2”. To do this a piece of stock 24” x 3” square 
must be prepared. In tapering the stock on the machine, the 3” end 
is rested on the bed opposite the cutting knives, allowing as little 
as possible of the stock to rest on the bed. The machine is set to 
take a fairly heavy cut and the work is now passed over the knives. 
At first, the cut is very light, but it increases as the stock nears the 
end of its cut. This operation is repeated and the cut is adjusted 
until the desired taper is reached. 
Another operation more hazardous than the latter is to cut a 
chamfer midway between the ends of a piece of stock. To do this, 
both beds of the machine are lowered the same distance, to a depth 
equal to the depth of the chamfer wanted. The guide is set at 45 
degrees, and the stock is let down onto the revolving cutter. Here 
is where the danger lies. The revolving knife is liable to throw 
the stock as it suddenly comes in contact with it, thus causing an 
accident. It is, therefore, advisable to clamp a stop against the
-P-A-G-E-181
SINGLE SuRFACE PLANER 181   
guide which will serve as a guide in starting the chamfer at an 
exact spot and also as a stop should the stock become loose. An- 
other stop at the other end of the guide would be advisable for 
stopping the work at the desired point. 
Providing a suitable arbor is used, a “V” joint may be cut 
on the edge of a board with special cutters. The edger is a hazard- 
ous machine and should be handled very carefully. By reducing 
the amount of clearance ahead of the knives in the arbor, as shown 
in Illus. 57, there is less danger of losing an entire finger if acci- 
dentally dropped on the knives. : 
When the knives become dull they must be ground. An 
attachment for this purpose is furnished by the manufacturers. If 
one of these is not at hand, the knives may be removed and sent to 
the manufacturer to be ground. 
Replacing a new set of knives or those which are returned 
after grinding will take a little experience. Both knives must be 
set so as to cut exactly in line, 
and again both knives must be 
exactly in line with the receiv- 
ing bed of the lathe. Honing 
the knives will also take some 
experience. After honing a set 
of knives which are in use, it 
will be necessary to drop the 
receiving bed in accordance 
with the amount of stock 
which has been removed from 
the knives. 
A close-up view of a shaftless motor driven planer is shown 
in Illus. 58. 
  Illus. 58 
Single Surface Planer 
The Single Surface Planer, Ilus. 59, is used in the pattern 
shop to bring a piece of stock down to a required thickness. In 
its operation “wind” is not removed from the stock as the board 
is temporarily pressed flat between the rollers while the planing 
takes place. It is, therefore, necessary, where a board is desired 
perfectly flat and otherwise true, to first run it over the hand planer 
and surfacer as noted before,
-P-A-G-E-182
  
182 Woop PatTtERN MAKING   
  Illus. 59 
Although little skill is required to run a planer, very little 
abuse will put the machine out of service. 
The planer illustrated is best suited for the pattern shop, but 
in the planing mill we also find such planers that will plane both 
or all sides of a piece in one operation. 
In describing the operation of the machine, we must picture 
the stock entering the machine through a pair or set of rollers, 
which are, therefore, known as the “feed rollers”. One would 
naturally think that the next operation of the machine would be 
for the revolving knives to plane the board. In this operation 
there is danger of the knives pulling up long slivers and chipping 
the wood. To avoid this, a pressure bar which bears down on the 
board just ahead of where the planing takes place, has been placed 
ahead of the revolving knives. Because it prevents chipping, it is 
known as a “chip breaker.” After the stock passes under the 
knives it again enters into a set of rollers which keep it rigid and 
flat during the planing of the remainder of the stock. 
The knives in this planer must also be ground occasionally, 
for which purpose the machine also includes a grinding attachment 
in its special equipment. Experience is required in the setting of 
new knives and in the honing of the cutting edge.

Wood Milling Machine 
In the construction of patterns, the Wood Milling Machine, as 
shown in Illus. 60 and 61, makes possible quicker service, better 
work, and a much lower cost of production. No limit can be placed 
on the intricate and unusual patterns which can be made on this 
machine, as practically 
the only stopping point 
seems to be the in- 
genuity of the operator. 
A fair idea of the ma- 
chine is gained when 
you know it means to 
the pattern maker what 
the universal milling 
machine means to the (JW o \ f rr - tool room, but this ma- 
chine has a greater range 
of adjustment. It in- 
cludes nearly every con- 
ceivable operation in 
pattern making. A great 
amount of delicate and slow hand work is eliminated. Bits are 
provided for almost any cut, and bits for special work can readily 
be made. Adjustments can be made in any direction and to any 
position without removing the 
work from the table. Every cut 
is absolutely accurate to within 
a few thousandths of an inch. 
Fillets can be cut in the wood 
of the original pattern, thus 
avoiding the use of leather or 
other fillets which may become 
loose in the sand.

Core Box Machine 
This machine, Illus. 66, has been brought out to meet the 
demand for a moderate priced core box machine that will take care 
of the smaller class of this work to be found in any pattern shop. 
It will handle any work up to its capacity in a first class manner, 
and it is much more accurate than the old hand core box plane. 
The machine is designed for straight circular core boxes 34” 
to 10”. The elbow attachment will take elbows from 3” to 12” 
radius. It can be used for practically all straight, chamber, or 
elbow core boxes up to its capacity.

37—ESTIMATING THE WEIGHT OF A CASTING 
In the foundry, the pattern shop and engineer’s office it be- 
comes necessary, at times, to estimate the weight of castings. This 
may become a necessity for a number of reasons, namely, esti- 
mating costs and figuring tonnage. 
Estimating Weight From the Drawing 
In the engineer’s office it is necessary to estimate from the 
drawing. This can be accomplished by figuring or estimating 
closely the number of square inches that are contained in the object 
to be cast. As a simple illustration, picture a working drawing 
for a block which is 6”x4” x2”. This would give us a total num- 
ber of square inches, amounting to 48. When this is known,
-P-A-G-E-187
  
EstiMATING WEIGHT OF CASTING 187 
multiply the figure by 0.263, which is the weight of a single cubic 
inch of iron. In this case 48x 0.263 amounts to 12.264, which is 
the number of pounds that the block would weigh. In estimating, 
where an exact figure is not given, it is only necessary to divide the 
total number of square inches by 4 as this will give almost the 
same result. For example, 48 square inches, total, divided by 4 
equals 12, the approximate weight of the block of iron. 
But the estimating of square inches does not always become 
so convenient, especially where the plan of the drawing is irregular 
in shape. In this case it might be suggested that the drawing be 
subdivided into squares, triangles, or possibly circles, the area of 
each estimated and then the total added together. The estimating, 
or better, figuring of all of these geometrical shapes has its short 
cuts by referring to suitable tables as given in various mechanical 
handbooks. 
Estimating the Weight of a Casting From a Pattern 
In the foundry it is necessary to constantly estimate weights 
of castings. This may be necessary in estimating prices on cer- 
tain jobs but more often it becomes necessary in figuring the 
amount of metal required for melting in the cupola. It would not 
be convenient or profitable to have a ton or two of molten metal 
on hand at the close of a heat. f 
Perhaps the most popular way of estimating the weight is by 
first weighing the pattern, deducting for the weight of the core 
print and core. Knowing this weight and the kind of wood used 
in the pattern, it is only necessary to refer to a chart and get a 
multiple which is used with the figure or weight of the pattern. 
Below is a chart as furnished in the American Machinist Hand- 
book:

As an illustration, suppose our pattern weighs 12 pounds, is 
made of mahogany and is to be used to make a brass casting. 
Refer to the chart. Opposite mahogany and under brass we find 
figure 13.2 which, multiplied by 12, gives us an approximate weight 
of the brass casting as 158.4 pounds. 
But when one stops to consider that woods vary in weight 
even when dried alike; that often the wood is dried more or less 
than it should be; a pattern is composed of more than one kind 
of wood; or screws, nails, and other fastenings as well as metal 
plates and dowels, are included in the pattern, we cannot speak 
for the accuracy of the method. But we must admit that the 
method is used widely in the estimating of castings. 
Estimating the Weight of a Casting by the Use of Water 
In the use of water we have one method which will give us 
as accurate an estimation as any of the weight of casting in ques- 
tion. But to use this method requires the conveniences of special 
equipment not always to be found in the foundry. : 
For this method two tanks are necessary. One of these tanks 
must be large enough to receive the pattern, while another below 
must be large enough to receive any water that overflows the tank 
above. To start the operation the tank is filled to a point just 
ready to overflow evenly all around. The pattern is submerged 
and all water displaced received in the vessel below. This is 
drained out of the tank, put on a scale and weighed. 
Now the core box is filled with water and this water drained 
out and weighed. This weight is then deducted from the first 
amount and the net weight multiplied by the specific gravity of 
the metal as wanted.

If the casting had been of aluminum and the specific gravity 
of this metal 2.6, the weight of the casting would have been 223.6 
pounds. If the casting had been of brass and the specific gravity 
of this metal approximately 8.5, the weight of the casting would 
have been 731 pounds.

FOREWORD 
This study represents the purposing, planning, and collective labors 
of the Child Study Committee of the International Kindergarten Union 
for the three years from 1919 to 1922. Each member has made some 
contribution—either by way of counsel, of materials, or of ratings 
for the scales. Some members have contributed in every aspect. With- 
out this whole-hearted codperation the study could not have been 
completed. 
The Committee extends grateful acknowledgment to the many 
public and private school officials—superintendents, supervisors, 
principals, and class-room teachers—who contributed the materials 
and who judged the drawings for the scales. It would be impossible 
to mention the names of all individuals. The following cities are 
represented in some phase of the work: 
Anderson, Indiana 
Ann Arbor, Michigan 
Baltimore, Maryland 
Bangor, Maine 
Berkeley, California 
Boston, Massachusetts

To the Presidents of the International Kindergarten Union for their 
sympathetic interest and generous contributions, to the members of 
the Educational Department of Goucher College for their participation, 
to Dr. Knight Dunlap, Professor of Psychology, Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, special thanks are due. 
The report of the investigation has been prepared with the interests 
of two diverse groups of readers in view: first, the scientific student

of educational research, for whose benefit the original data and statistical 
tables have been presented; and, second, the class-room teacher, for 
whose benefit the practical conclusions, the bearings of the investiga- 
tion upon school procedure, have been emphasized. To those of the 
latter group who are untrained in statistical methods it is suggested 
that Chapter II be omitted from the reading. 
The Committee presents the results of this first attempt to apply 
the principles and methods of scientific measurement in education to 
the achievements of the kindergarten-primary group with due modesty. 
If it should prove a stimulus to further progress in this direction, and 
in the meantime provide an instrument for clarifying some issues con- 
cerning interests, values and results in the earliest period of school life, 
it will have been worth while. In this hope we send it forth.

CHAPTER I 
CHILDREN’S INTERESTS AS MANIFESTED BY THEIR DRAWINGS 
The most universal mode of human expression, other than oral 
language and gesture, is drawing. It constitutes the means by which 
our primitive ancestors conquered time by permanent records, and 
annihilated space by communication with others at a distance. Con- 
ventionalized and symbolically interpreted, it became picture-writing, 
out of which the modern phonetic alphabet has been evolved. Its 
contribution to human progress has been incalculable. 
Drawing is also among the earliest instruments for the expression 
of ideas in early childhood. It is the most typical and universal form 
of manual representation employed in the kindergarten and the pri- 
mary school. When the Child Study Committee undertook to select 
for intensive investigation some phase of the spontaneous activity of 
young children, it was natural that their choice should be drawing. 
Other considerations of a practical nature influenced this choice: 
the results of drawing activity are easily collected, preserved, and sub- 
jected to analysis and critical judgment. The data thus obtained gave 
promise of special interest in their bearing upon certain unsolved prob- 
lems of child psychology. Some of these problems had been definitely 
formulated and passed on to us as suggestions by the previous Committee 
on Child Study. 
Since the interest of the investigators was primarily in the years of 
early childhood, the study was arbitrarily limited to the period covering 
the kindergarten, first, and second grades. This period formed a 
convenient and seemingly valid unit—in view of the increasing tend- 
ency of psychologists to regard the ages represented in these grades 
as comprising somewhat closely related stages of child development, 
having many psychological traits in common; and the equally significant 
practical tendency of school administrators to regard these grades as 
one unit for purposes of school organization and supervision. 
However, the well-known effect of retardation in school progress is 
to hold many children in the kindergarten, and more especially. in the 
first and second grades, far beyond the normal period, so that these 
grades have the widest distribution of ages to be found in the whole 
“sf

  8 \ CHILDREN’S‘ DRAWINGS 
school system. But the chronologically older children are not typical 
of the grades. Either they are accidentally retarded, normal children 
who by rights belong in higher grades, or, more frequently, they are 
subnormal, actually accelerated children, who belong in a segregated 
class from the beginning. ( 
In order that the study might be freed from the complications pre- 
sented by these two groups, arbitrary age limits were fixed at four years 
and eight years, eleven months. Considerable data were secured on 
the over-age groups, but they have been rigidly excluded from the main 
study, and treated separately in so far as it has been possible to use 
them at all. The investigation was then defined as a study of the 
spontaneous drawings of children of the kindergarten, first, and second 
grades, and of the years from four to eight inclusive. 
Further definition of purpose was necessary, however, and after 
careful consideration it was decided that an examination of the sub- 
jects drawn, as possible evidence of children’s trend of interests, was 
the fundamental problem, the results of which would determine some- 
what the direction of further research. The construction of a series 
of scales for the measurement of abilities seemed the logical next step. 
The application of the scales to the drawings available, for the deter- 
mination of age norms, relative abilities of ages, grades, and sexes, and 
correlations with general intelligence, naturally followed. Finally, 
certain subsidiary problems as to the trend of development in drawing 
technique—in the use of outline and mass, full-face and profile repre- 
sentation of the human form, proportion, balance, and perspective— 
presented themselves as at least of minor interest to those who are 
practically concerned with primary education. The study proceeded 
in virtually this order. 
The first task was the collection of a sufficient mass of material— 
a large number of drawings, as spontaneous as could be secured under 
. class-room conditions, made by children of the desired ages and grades, 
and from as wide a geographical distribution as possible. Letters 
were sent to thirty-four cities, asking the codperation of public school 
superintendents or supervisors in securing this material. The cities 
were so selected as to represent North and South, East and West, 
central and Rocky Mountain areas, metropolises, and smaller towns, 
the one uniform condition being that there should be kindergartens 
connected with the schools. Some private schools were also included. 
Twenty-six cities responded favorably: Anderson, Indiana; Balti-

more, Maryland; Bangor, Maine; Berkeley, California; Boston, Massa- 
chusetts; Buffalo, New York; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Chicago, 
Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Des 
Moines, Iowa; Detroit, Michigan; Indianapolis, Indiana; Kansas City, 
Missouri; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New Orleans, 
Louisiana; New York, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Richmond, 
Indiana; Richmond, Virginia; Rochester, New York; St. Louis, Missouri; 
Trenton, New Jersey; and Washington, D. C. 
At once, typewritten directions were sent to each city in sufficient 
number for each teacher who was to participate. It was suggested 
that the schools be selected with regard to social conditions of the 
population, so that all levels should be represented; and that the dis- 
tribution of drawings from the three classes, kindergarten, first, and 
second grades, be equalized as far as possible. The instructions to the 
individual class-room teachers were as follows: 
We are desirous of making some very definite investigations with regard to chil- 
dren’s drawings. As the first step we wish to know what subjects children of the 
ages from four to eight inclusive choose for their spontaneous drawings. 
Will you assist us by carrying out the following instructions: 
1, Give to each child, or have him procure for himself, wax crayon in brown or 
black, and drawing paper 6 by 9 inches. 
2. Say, “I want you each to make me a picture today. You may draw anything 
you wish. Do not let anyone know what you are going to draw. When you have 
finished, bring it to me, and see if I can tell what it is. Draw anything you want to.” 
Give no further suggestion, or guidance, or criticism, except to repeat if necessary the 
above directions. 
3. Write on the back of each drawing the sex and age of the child in years and 
months, and the name of the object, or objects, represented. 
The response was gratifying. In most instances the returns were 
sent from the three grades and represented all ages, although in some 
cases this was not possible. Since the age of admission to kindergartens 
in many cities is five years, the representation of four year old children 
was relatively small. As partial compensation for this, in one city 
where a complete representation was not practicable, but where there 
is an unusually large enrollment of four year old children in the kinder- 
gartens, only the four year old children were included. The represen- 
tation of eight year children is also smaller for two reasons: since the 
majority of children enter the primary school at six years and progress 
regularly by annual promotions through the grades, many eight year 
children have passed beyond the second grade. Owing to a misunder-
-P-A-G-E-9
10 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
standing of the directions, some drawings from those who still remained 
in the lowest grades were discarded before the results were forwarded 
to the committee. Nevertheless the returns from all grades and ages 
are sufficiently large to have scientific significance. 
Numbers of drawings not clearly designated as to sex and age were 
discarded as useless for our purposes. Those for which the grade was 
not indicated were retained and grouped together as “unclassified.” 
Table 1 presents the number of drawings actually used in the study, 
classified according to grades, sexes and ages.

Two restrictions were imposed upon the liberty of the children: the 
dimensions of the drawing paper were to be 6 by 9 inches, and the 
crayons were to be of neutral tone, either brown or black. Although 
the committee was fully conscious of the present tendency toward very 
large materials, with its psychological and hygienic significance, the 
limitation on the size of paper seemed imperative for practical reasons. 
In handling the large mass of material required for the study, even 
9 by 12 inch paper, which is the minimum size demanded by present 
standards, would have been prohibitively unwieldy.
-P-A-G-E-10
  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 11 
Color was eliminated for the purpose of simplifying the problem of 
evaluating the drawings in the construction and use of the scales. The 
Committee wished to limit its objective to the consideration of one type 
of ability—the ability to express meaning through line and mass. It 
was assumed that ability to handle color effectively might very probably 
be a specialized trait, not necessarily associated with power of expression 
in line and mass. An individual who handled color quite well might 
therefore be deficient in his representation of form, and, vice versa, 
an individual with considerable power in representation of form might 
be deficient in feeling for color. The attempt to evaluate the two to- 
gether would thus be exceedingly difficult, 
Furthermore, a nice use of color may conceal many crudities of 
form, and on the other hand faulty coloring may detract from an other- 
wise good representation. The difficulty of judging form as distinct 
from color is thereby increased at least twofold. It seemed advisable 
therefore to eliminate color from the present investigation, although 
with a keen realization that it plays an important part in the educative 
use of drawing, and that its investigation offers an alluring field for 
future study. 
Undoubtedly for some children who had been accustomed to the 
free use of color and to paper of large size, these two restrictions were 
distinctly limiting factors in expression. Nevertheless the results 
seem to justify the procedure. The wide range of subjects represented 
is not suggestive of serious restraint in self-expression. The excellence 
of many of the drawings is a sufficient denial of the deterrent effect 
of either limitation. The fact that young children frequently choose 
deliberately some one color or paper of small size suggests that neither 
of the conditions is wholly contrary to normal tendencies. 
Finally, there is some definite evidence confirming the basic assump- 
tions. A number of teachers, not content with following directions, 
sent two sets of drawings—one made under the specified conditions, 
the other on larger paper with unrestricted color. Their avowed pur- 
pose was to prove that the children’s powers had been hampered by the 
restrictions. In fact, when the pairs of drawings were evaluated by 
trained judges, strictly on the basis of their representative value in 
form, there was no appreciable difference. Whether this would be 
true of large numbers of drawings remains to be seen. The state- 
ment is not to be interpreted as implying that the Committee would 
advocate the habitual elimination of color, or the encouragement of 
hygienically questionable materials. The procedure was thought justi-
-P-A-G-E-11

fiable for the purposes of scientific experiment, not for educational 
practise. 
Each drawing had been labeled by the teacher with the age and sex 
of the young artist, and the subject, or subjects, represented. On 
receipt of the packages at headquarters, each set was stamped with two 
symbols, one for the grade, and one for the city, so that it was possible 
to arrange and classify the drawings in any desired way without de- 
stroying the identity of any sample. 
The first project—the investigation of the range of subjects selected 
by the children—was now undertaken. A number of previous investi- 
gators have been interested in this question. Shinn, Major, Brown, 
Hogan, and Jordan have collected drawings of individuals or small 
groups of children, extending over a period of years, and indicating 
changes of interest with age. These studies cover in general the period 
from one to three, four, or five years, and are especially valuable for 
the light they throw upon the development of technical ability in repre- 
sentation. 
Several investigators have made mass studies of considerable num- 
bers of children. Lukens! (1897) collected 1232 drawings of children 
under ten years of age. He found that 44 per cent of all children repre- 
sented the human form, or, if illustrations were included, 75 per cent. 
Twelve per cent illustrated stories, 7 per cent drew animals, 3 per cent 
plants, 2 per cent geometrical forms, design, and scribble combined. 
Mrs. Maitland (reported by Lukens, 1897) collected 1570 drawings 
of children ranging in age from five to seventeen years, from the public 
schools of California and the Experimental School of Leland Stanford 
University. Of these, 45 per cent of the younger children had drawn 
the human figure, 40 per cent still life, 35 per cent plants and flowers, 
32 per cent houses, 5 per cent design, and 3 per cent ornament. “The 
drawings of children from eight to ten years of age remained substanti- 
ally the same in content as those of the younger children.” 
Ivanoff (reported by Katzeroff,? 1910) examined 2062 drawings of 
children from the public schools of Geneva, Switzerland, to discover the 
range of interests. He found again that the human form predominated, 
and of the persons drawn, 95 per cent were adults. He also indicates 
certain sex differences. The boys drew a wider range of subjects, 
while the girls tended to draw objects from their immediate environ- 
ment. The girls drew more landscapes, flowers, and geometrical forms

-P-A-G-E-12
  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 13 
than the boys, suggesting either a more limited mental content or a 
more docile attitude toward school instruction. 
None of these studies states the conditions under which the samples 
were obtained. Since none of them covers definitely and specifically 
the period of the present investigation, and since the most recent of 
them was reported fourteen years ago, it seemed worth while to attack 
the problem anew. 
Each of the 31,239 drawings of our collection was therefore examined 
and, with the aid of the interpretation written on the back, its con- 
tent was recorded. Each separate idea represented—or attempted— 
was noted, and also, in case of compositions, the subject of the com- 
position. No object is listed separately which occurs only as an es- 
sential part of a larger whole. For instance, if hair, eye, nose, and 
hand are inventoried it is because they were drawn as separate units, 
distinct from the human form of which they are organic parts. Simi- 
larly, steps, door, window, and chimney are listed because they were 
portrayed quite apart from the house of which they are essentially 
details. 
An idea was recorded only once for each sample of drawing. If two 
or more trees, or houses, or boats occurred in a single picture, only 
one of each was noted. Ground and smoke from the chimney were 
omitted as non-essential. From the vantage point of present expe- 
rience, this is perhaps unfortunate. 
In the early stages of the work the teachers giving the test were 
requested to make the records, using a standard form. Later it was 
found best to spare the teachers, and incidentally to secure uniformity 
of method, by having all tabulations made by a clerical force under 
the supervision of the chairman. The records made by the teachers were 
afterwards revised by this same clerical force, and thus made com- 
parable with the other results. 
The work of each class was first recorded on a separate sheet, of 
which a sample is presented in table 2. Next, all the returns for each 
grade were combined into a table for the city. These summaries were 
then combined into a graded table representing the returns from all 
cities. Finally the three grades were combined into a general sum- 
mary by ages and sexes. At each stage of the process, the specific 
character of the data was preserved in all its detail, so that it might 
be possible to refer back to any aspect, to analyze and compare by 
sex, age, grade, or city. The complete list by ages and sexes is pre- 
sented in table 3. (See Appendix for table 3.)

  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 15 
The data in this detailed form were too complex to suggest any general 
tendencies or to lend themselves to analysis and comparison. It was 
necessary to classify the materials, reducing them to a few generic 
groups. After considerable study of the lists, they were finally reduced 
to thirty-five headings, exclusive of compositions, which were reserved 
for separate treatment. 
Several larger groupings naturally suggested themselves—human 
beings, nature forms, buildings, and ideas arising from social experi- 
ences. Further subdivisions were necessary within each of these groups. 
They were made either on the basis of the frequency with which the 
subclasses appeared or of the interest attaching to particular trends 
of selection. 
Human beings of generic type—‘‘a boy,” ‘“‘a lady’’—were classified 
as adults or children and infants. In case a definite type or individual 
was portrayed—a policeman, an Indian, Little Jack Horner—it was 
listed as a “‘special character.” 
Nature forms naturally fell into the rubrics animal, vegetable, 
meteorological and geographic; but because of the special interest that 
might attach to certain minor divisions, birds and insects were segre- 
gated from the generic group of animals. Vegetable forms were sub- 
divided into trees, fruits, flowers, and vegetables. Meteorological ideas 
were distinguished into two groups—sun, moon and stars comprising 
one; rain, snow, water (except in geographical conceptions, as lakes, and 
streams), Aurora Borealis, and similar ideas, the other. Nature forms 
which did not lend themselves to any logical grouping—either flesh or 
fowl, or good red herring—were grouped together as miscellaneous 
nature forms. 
Buildings were further specified as dwelling houses, parts of houses 
(windows, doors, etc., occurring separately); public buildings, includ- 
ing churches, hospitals, jails, factories, shops, post offices, etc.; animal 
houses (dog kennels, rabbit hutches, cages for wild animals, and barns); 
and miscellaneous buildings. 
Ideas relating to social experiences include a wide range, necessitating 
several sub-headings. Vehicles were of special interest as indicative 
of certain sex differences. They embrace virtually all mechanical 
means of locomotion; for example, wagons, automobiles, trucks, sleds, 
doll buggies, aeroplanes, and boats. Tools connote all types of per- 
sonal and household utensils, farm implements, weapons, and machinery. 
Receptacles are defined as containers of every sort; as, barrels and 
suit-cases.
-P-A-G-E-15
  16 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
Under toys were listed all materials and apparatus for sports and 
play; as, see-saws, golf clubs, and skis. Furniture covers all forms of 
house furnishings not otherwise listed—rugs and pillows, as well as 
tables and chairs. Foods were limited, by the classification of fruits 
and vegetables under nature forms, to manufactured products—bread, 
candy, meat, etc. 
Clothing includes articles of personal use and adornment as well as 
covering; for example, eye-glasses, bracelets, and necklaces. Flags 
were segregated because they might be indicative of differences in the 
attitude toward the larger social life. Design offered illumination on 
two points—interest of children in esthetic interpretation, and changes 
of attitude resulting from the present tendency away from emphasis 
on design in instruction, especially in the kindergarten period. 
Letters and numbers were listed in order to indicate the interest 
of children in printing or writing for its own sake. They do not in- 
clude the purposive writing of the name on the back of the paper to 
designate ownership (found almost exclusively in the second grade), 
but the numerous attempts to write or print words, or letters, or num- 
bers, either in relation to a picture, or, more frequently, as isolated 
items of interest—attempts which were found at four years, and more 
frequently at five or six years, possibly as hints of a dawning interest 
in symbols. 
The classification in some instances may seem arbitrary. It repre- 
sents the most convenient and economical mode of reducing to order 
the vast array of heterogeneous material, without doing serious violence 
to the major facts as to general trends of selection. The preservation 
of the data in their entirety, in table 3, will serve to indicate the de- 
tails of the grouping and provide means of further study and inference. 
The first impression is one of astonishment at the variety and range 
of ideas represented—or attempted. Nothing seems beyond the ef- 
forts of the child artist, whether in the heavens above, or the earth 
beneath, or the waters under the earth. About nine hundred different 
ideas are depicted, the distribution of which is indicated in table 4. 
The distribution of drawings under each of the headings and sub- 
headings varies enormously. Since the number of drawings for the 
several grades and ages, and to a less degree for the boys and girls, is 
also a variable quantity, the facts are not comparable until they have 
been reduced to a percentile basis. The basis selected was the total 
number of objects drawn. Table 5 (page 18) gives the summary on which
-P-A-G-E-16
  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 17 
these percentages have been calculated. It reads, the four year old boys 
in kindergarten drew a total of 2191 objects, those in first grade, 11, 
making a total of 2202 objects drawn by four year old boys, etc. 
By the use of this table and the table showing the numbers of objects 
of each of the thirty-five classes drawn by each group, the percen-

tages were computed, as given in table 6 (pages 20-23). This table is to 
be interpreted as follows: reading across the page, of the four year old 
boys in kindergarten the drawings consisted of 6.5 per cent scribbling, 
12.1 per cent adult human beings, 4.7 children and babies, and 1.6 per 
cent “special characters,” making a total of 18.4 per cent drawings 
of human beings, etc. Reading down the page, of the drawings

secured from kindergarten children, scribbling constituted 6.5 per 
cent of the total content for the four year boys, 5.1 per cent for the 
four year girls, 1.7 per cent for five year boys, etc. The data are first 
presented for each grade by ages and sexes, and then summarized for 
the three grades, for the total number of boys and girls, respectively, 
and finally for all children irrespective of age, grade or sex. 
Several comparisons are at once possible. Observing first the grand 
totals, we may discover certain generic trends of interest. It is evident 
that the human form is most popular, comprising 16.5 per cent of all 
the objects drawn. The adult form is slightly more popular than the

child. Houses come second, with 13.9 per cent. These two are in 
harmony with all previous studies, although the different basis of 
computation makes it impossible to compare numerically. 
Trees, with a perceatage of 9.3 and furniture (8.3) were less expected. 
The low status of animals (4.0 per cent) and of toys (3.8), which are 
on the same level as flowers, were even less to be anticipated. The 
meagre showing of design (0.5), in view of the past emphasis which 
the kindergarten has placed upon it, is significant. The facts of the 
general summary are presented graphically in figure 1 (page 24), which 
needs no explanation.
-P-A-G-E-18
CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 19 
Grouping the facts still further, we find that interest in nature claims 
30.4 per cent of the content of these drawings, while interest in man 
and the activities, tools and buildings connected with social life may 
fairly be said to claim all the rest—excepting only the 0.9 per cent 
that represents the survival of the scribble stage, and possibly the 0.5 
per cent that represents design. The 0.1 per cent of geometrical forms, 
which is limited to one or two cities, and exclusively to the kindergarten 
group, might also be excepted, although it is too insignificant to be 
included in the classification, and is probably a survival from an earlier 
era of kindergarten training. It seems fair to say that while nature 
in all its aspects holds one-third of the representative interest of these 
children, human life and its relationships monopolize the remaining 
two-thirds. 
Certain constant tendencies are manifested in the change of subjects 
with age. Of these, the most striking is the steady decrease in the 
number of reproductions of the human form (21.4, 19.5, 16.1, 14.7, 
11.6 per cent respectively for the four, five, six, seven, and eight year 
groups). The generic adult form—‘“a man,” “a lady,”’—is constantly 
diminishing (12.6, 10.8, 6.6, 5.5, 5.1), while child drawings appear to 
reach a maximum at six years, declining at seven and eight. Special 
characters, on the contrary rise steadily, though slightly, in value 
(1.2, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5, 1.9). 
The several classes of nature forms show varying tendencies. Ani- 
mals, domestic birds, and “miscellaneous nature forms’ fluctuate 
from year to year. Fruits and vegetables, and insects decrease steadily 
from the fourth to the ninth year; but wild birds, sky, sun, moon, and 
stars, trees, flowers, and geographical conceptions rise consistently, 
so that the general tendency of nature forms is steadily upward (25.8, 
27.5, 29.2, 32.7, 37.7 per cent). 
Buildings as drawing subjects also appear more attractive to older 
children, though with a decided drop at eight years (16.7, 18.9, 23.0, 
23.9, 20.3). This same tendency is seen in the subordinate groups,— 
houses and miscellaneous buildings—though parts of houses, public 
buildings and animal houses vary independently. Dishes, flags, and 
letters and numbers show an upward trend, with slight deviations. 
Furniture increases until seven years, when there is a slight downward 
movement. Interest in toys as drawing subjects appears to reach its 
culmination at five years, decreasing steadily thereafter (4.5, 5.2, 3.8, 
2.9, 2.4). Tools, receptacles, clothing and food, miscellaneous forms,

in drawing, nature in nearly all its phases as steadily increases. Toys 
and furniture reach their high point of interest at five years, tools and 
vehicles at six, buildings, at seven. Figure 2 gives these data in graphic 
form (page 26). 
While sex differences appear with striking constancy at every age 
and in every city, those differences are never great. The following

Boys and girls chose equally wild birds, insects, foods, letters and 
numbers, and miscellaneous forms. Since an absolute difference of 
small degree may be more significant in case of a small number than 
of a larger one, it may be interesting to express the more striking dif- 
ferences as ratios. Selecting those items in which one sex differed 
from the other by 20 per cent or more, and converting the absolute 
percentages into the per cent which the smaller number was of the 
larger, we arrive at the results shown in table 8. The same facts are 
represented in figure 3 (page 28). 
In so far as these differences can legitimately be made the basis of 
generalization, it may be said that boys tend to select for representation 
objects connected with a wider range of adult social interests; as, adult

human beings, special characters, public buildings and flags. Boys 
much more frequently select objects of mechanical value—vehicles 
and tools. In drawing from nature, they appear to attend more to the 
larger aspects, and to animal life. Girls are more likely to select among 
social interests those relating directly to childhood itself—children, 
babies, and toys; and to domestic life—furniture and dishes. In nature 
they prefer plant life—trees and flowers, fruits and vegetables. Con- 
sidering also the slightly greater interest in design, it might be said 
that the girls tend toward the esthetic, as the boys toward the mechani- 
cal, or scientific aspects of life. 
Far more significant than these differences, however, are the corre- 
spondences. In only eight classes is there a difference of more than 
1 per cent between the choices of the two sexes. In only three, adult

human beings, furniture and vehicles, is the difference 3 per cent or 
more. In the last named only does it exceed 5 per cent. Of the thirty- 
five classes, five are chosen equally by boys and girls. In twenty-one, 
the variation is less than 1 per cent; in thirteen it is less than 0.5 per 
cent. Moreover, there is no class of objects which has not been selected 
by both sexes at least thirty times. An examination of the detailed 
list in table 3 shows that the sex line is nowhere sharply drawn. Boys 
have selected dolls, doll buggies, hair ribbons, clothes-pins, skirts, and 
pillows; while girls have drawn wireless, a threshing machine, a gun,

a farmer, and doctor. In fact the differences, with few exceptions, 
are so slight as to suggest the accidents of environment as their causes. 
The question naturally arises: just how significant are the facts con- 
cerning choice of subjects? Obviously, it must be recognized that one 
drawing is not an adequate measure of any child’s range or trend of 
interest. ' Just as obviously all such data must be regarded as, at least 
in part, the result of environmental and accidental causes. 
First, the influence of the school itself is to be reckoned with. Lin- 
coln’s cabin, the Pilgrims, Indian camps and wigwams are undoubtedly 
the outcome of class instruction. A preponderance of illustrated nur- 
sery rhymes, of identical or similar landscapes, of boys skating, in
-P-A-G-E-27

any one school or city-grade gives indication of previous art training, 
and frequently of a mental set due to a lesson just received. The 
tendency to draw something that will please the teacher also weighs 
heavily upon many children.

Next there is the factor of technique, the consciousness of difficulties 
in the expression of one’s real interest, which doubtless impels some 
children to follow the line of least resistance—to choose something 
easy, to copy their neighbors (in spite of the injunction), or to repeat 
yesterday’s lesson. Technical difficulties do not have weight with   
     
-P-A-G-E-28
  CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 29 
most four and five year old children. The spirit of self-criticism is 
probably present in a low degree in the maturer five year old, and 
develops coincidentally with a clearer vision of reality. It is this which 
has been suggested as the explanation of the decreasing tendency to 
draw the human form—not loss of interest, but a growing consciousness 
of difficulties, and doubt of one’s own ability to surmount them. 
There is finally the more subtle, yet far-reaching influence of the 
wider social environment. Valentines, Easter rabbits, Jack o’ Lan- 
terns, and Christmas trees mark the progress of the social calendar. 
Charlie Chaplins, Kaisers and bogie men are the product of experience 
beyond the reach of schools. 
Other influences, less measurable, are probably at work in deter- 
mining the sex differences which occur. The fact that boys, from early 
childhood, are provided with mechanical toys—balls, blocks, and 
vehicles of motion,—and are exposed to a wider social environment 
on the street or city pavement; while girls, by social usage, are pro- 
vided with dolls, toy dishes, furniture, and sewing materials and are 
more closely confined to the home and the backyard, would inevitably 
lead to just such differences as were found—a wider social horizon for the 
boys, and an emphasis on domestic and childish interests for the girls— 
in so far as the differences were great enough to call for any explanation 
at all. 
That school influence was a potent factor was evident, not only 
from the similarities in content within certain schools and systems 
of schools, but from the range of interests represented. In some cities, 
the drawings revealed a rich and varied imaginative content; in others, 
even the maturer children of the second grade were satisfied to draw 
a box, a square, or a ball, and individuals varied little from the group 
as a whole. Expressed in numerical terms, in one city only forty dif- 
ferent ideas per hundred children were expressed, while in another 
seven hundred different ideas were represented. 
It seems fair to assume that the former city either gave to its children 
a wider range of interesting experiences, or developed in them greater 
freedom and power of expression, or both. This suggests a possible 
dual explanation, which appears to be substantiated by a knowledge 
of educational methods in a number of the cities in question. 
Meagerness of content may have come as a result of extreme formal- 
ism of instruction at the time when the drawings were made. Em- 
phasis on the three R’s may have allowed little time for enlarging
-P-A-G-E-29
30 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
experience, and practically none for self-expression. At the other ex- 
treme were some cities experimenting with freer organization, where 
the emphasis on the children’s initiative may have limited the range 
of experience; or children’s free choice and free use of materials may 
have provided too little practise in drawing, or too little guidance in 
its use. Other causes, for example, the chance selection of classes below 
normal, may have been operative, though this is not likely to have been 
the case for all the classes representing any one city. 
In conclusion, it can only be said that certain choices, showing defi- 
nite tendencies were consistently made by widely separated groups. 
In the main, these tendencies corroborated the findings of previous 
studies. How far they are the result of innate characteristics, and 
how far they are dependent upon social circumstance is probably one 
of the many aspects of the larger issue—heredity versus environment— 
which must remain unsolved. 
  COMPOSITIONS 
The individual objects making up compositions were included in the 
foregoing report, but composition itself was reserved for separate treat- 
ment. Composition for the purposes of this study was defined broadly 
as any attempt to create a unified picture, or to portray two or more 
objects in relation to each other, without regard to esthetic or interpre- 
tive values. The picture might be illustrative of nature, social life, 
or literature. One drawing is described as “a horse climbing a tree.” 
Neither horse nor tree is recognizable, but by definition the effort or 
intention to represent two ideas in relation to one another constitutes 
the product a composition. The essential problem was the extent to 
which children of the several ages were interested in representations 
having narrative or descriptive content, rather than in mere catalogues 
of unrelated ideas. : 
A summary of the facts as to the number and general character of 
compositions, is presented in table 9. These values are expressed as 
per cents of the total number of drawings (table 1). The table is to be 
interpreted: of the total number of four year old boys included in 
the study (2202) 0.7 per cent attempted to reproduce a story; 0.3 per 
cent a nursery rhyme; 0.3 per cent some phase of child activity, for 
example, playing ball, having a tea party; 1.1 per cent an idea of social 
or industrial life, and 0.8 per cent an incident or scene from nature— 
making a total of 3.2 per cent of four year old boys who tried to 
express ideas in relation to each other.

  32 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
It is evident that this tendency is not strong in the four year old 
children, 96.6 per cent of all having chosen either single objects, or 
numbers of objects unrelated to each other, as parts of a scene or ele- 
ments of a story. There is a gradual development of the tendency 
from year to year—3.4, 6.7, 11.7, 15.2, 20.9 per cent respectively, at 
four, five, six, seven, and eight years. This might have been anticipated 
from the evidence of the Binet-Simon tests on the verbal interpretation 
of pictures. Enumeration is characteristic of the younger children; 
interpretation, in terms of narration or description or better, is expected 
of the children at seven years. The ability to interpret verbally, 
however, would presumably precede the ability to represent graphically. 
A continuation of the study with the mentally maturer eight and nine 
year old children would probably show a marked rise in the curve. 
Sex differences are not marked. The girls show slightly greater 
maturity at each age until eight years, the difference being greatest 
at six years. The amounts of the differences for the several ages are 
0.4, 0.4, 1.0, 0.4 per cent, while at eight years the boys lead by 0.8 per 
cent. 
The subjects of the compositions have been roughly classified into 
five groups, which are self-explanatory. The general tendency in 
this respect conforms somewhat closely to that for single objects: the 
same sex differences are evident in the slightly greater percentage of 
boys drawing social and industrial subjects, of girls drawing activities 
relating to child life (with the exception of the six year group), and 
nature (except at six and eight years). The girls lead inrepresentation 
of literature. Again the differences are not marked. 
The most striking age difference in the type of composition is in 
nature subjects, rising from 1 per cent at four years to 9.3 per cent at 
eight years. Nursery rhymes seem to reach their high point at six 
years, declining at seven, and remaining stationary at eight. There is 
however such evidence of class instruction in the drawings of nature 
scenes and the illustration of certain popular nursery rhymes that no 
definite inferences may be made. 
PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS 
What practical conclusions, if any, concerning education may be 
drawn from this study of children’s interests? Certainly the greatest 
caution must be exercised in drawing psychological inferences. The 
many evidences of environmental forces in determining the direction  
-P-A-G-E-32
CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 33 
and range of representation, and the inevitable influence of technical 
difficulties in limiting graphic expression as soon as children become 
conscious of technique at all—both of these factors must be considered 
in relation to any attempt to arrive at native interests by way of pic- 
torial expression. 
Some of the results of this study are suggestive however of probable 
trends of natural, if not of native interest. The first is the prepon- 
derance of the human element over the natural, suggesting the validity 
of the present tendency to emphasize the social and industrial relation- 
ships in early education and to approach the study of natural science by 
way of its social references. The second is the subordinate part played 
by child activities as compared with the interest in the larger social 
world of adult life. 
Perhaps equally significant is the emphasis upon buildings and vehi- 
cles in contrast with clothing and foods. In so far as drawing is sympto- 
matic, children are preéminently concerned with the fundamental 
economic needs of shelter and transportation, but only slightly with 
those of food and clothing. Perhaps again the normal approach to the 
latter is by way of the former, leading from transportation, for example, 
to the foods transported, and not, according to adult logic, from the 
foods to their transporation. 
Considering sex differences, we may be justified in suggesting greater 
effort in education to counteract the narrowing tendency of previous 
environmental influences in the interests of girls. Present day social 
organization no longer permits the domestic seclusion of women, but 
imposes on them a high degree of political and social responsibility. 
This implies as its pre-condition a wider outlook, a more impersonal 
attitude than their past status demanded. Since fundamental atti- 
tudes are frequently fixed during the early years of life, it would seem 
wise to divert interest somewhat from the preoccupation with domestic 
ideas—dolls and house-keeping—to the larger view. 
The wide range of variation among cities and individual classes in 
the wealth of content represented is surely indicative of wide differences 
in the number and fertility of experiences presented by the school. 
It has already been suggested that meagreness of content may be due 
to two widely divergent causes—an over-emphasis on the formal sub- 
jects of the curriculum on the one hand, or an over-emphasis on the 
freedom and initiative of the child on the other. 
Dr. Dewey long ago pointed out the dangers of this tendency in 
the “new education:” . 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
34 CHILDREN’S. DRAWINGS 
The child is expected to “develop” this or that fact or truth out of his own mind. 
He is told to think things out, or work things out for himself, without being supplied 
any of the environing conditions which are requisite to start and guide thought. 
Nothing can be developed from nothing; nothing but the crude can be developed out 
of the crude—and this is what surely happens when we throw the child back upon 
his achieved self as a finality, and invite him to spin new truths of nature or of conduct 
out of that. It is certainly as futile to expect a child to evolve a universe out of his 
own mere mind as it is for a philosopher to attempt that task. 
Because of its renewed emphasis upon children’s initiative, not 
merely in planning means and methods and judging the results of 
their activities but also in initiating problems to be solved and projects 
to be executed, the problem-project method has been particularly 
exposed to this danger. That its leading exponents are aware of the 
danger is clearly evident. Dr. Kilpatrick says in a recent symposium 
on “The Dangers and Difficulties of the Project Method,” 
A school means children living and learning, with older people who embody the 
race experience, present to transmit and guide. . . . . Our need of teachers is 
just as definite as is that of the ordinary school. The conception of the school devel- 
oped earlier explains our position here: children living and learning, older people 
present to stimulate and guide, the race experience to furnish the basis of guidance, 
the resulting growth in the children implying the increasing appropriation of the race 
experience.” 
That experience in the earliest period of education implies first hand 
contacts with reality needs no argument. Whether children draw 
directly from models seen or from images previously formed, the variety 
and adequacy of the ideas they represent will depend wholly upon the 
variety and vividness of the experiences upon which their representa- 
tions are based. 
Concerning drawing itself, the most significant inference is that 
drawing must have a definite place in. the activities of young children 
if its values are to be realized. These values are momentous and vital. 
On the intellectual side, drawing stimulates to closer observation of 
the objects drawn—whether drawn directly from the model or from 
images arising from previous experience—and thereby to a more ac- 
curate and detailed knowledge of the visible world. It motivates ob- 
servation, leading to more rigorous attention, and resulting in more 
permanent impressions.

CHILDREN’S INTERESTS 35 
Drawing is one means of promoting the development of apprecia- 
tions—first of the beauties of form and color in the objects pictured, 
and later of the beauties of the fine arts through a rudimentary knowl- 
edge of the technical difficulties which have been met and mastered. 
Finally, the development of some degree of technical skill is not 
without value as affording a special medium for the expression of ideas, 
supplementing and reinforcing language—one which affords immediate 
satisfactions and which may be of use in many lines of vocational or 
avocational activity in later life. 
While the old education frequently stultified drawing by an over- 
emphasis upon technique and imitation, the new education frequently 
tends to neglect this phase of expression and interest. It is one of 
the functions of the teacher as guide and director of children’s activi- 
ties to stimulate interest in this fundamental mode of expression—by 
giving prominence to its materials in the school environment, by re- 
warding its manifestations with attention and approval, and by positive 
suggestions from time to time, of the employment of drawing as a 
medium and of worth-while subjects to be drawn. 
In the details of drawing instruction several suggestions seem justi- 
fied. The first is the encouragement of children in drawing the human 
face and figure. All studies of the content of children’s drawings agree - 
in designating the human form as the subject of major interest among 
beginners. Several agree with the present investigation in indicating 
steadily decreasing interest with age. While this may be attributable 
to an actual decline in psychological interest, it seems more probable 
that it is due to an increasing consciousness of the technical difficulties 
involved, to a growing self-distrust as the result of enhanced experience 
and greater definiteness of observation. 
A contributing factor is also the teacher’s consciousness of technical 
difficulties, and frequently, of her own limitations, resulting in an 
emphasis upon nature and still-life. It may be seriously questioned, 
in view of the very evident trend of interest, whether this emphasis 
is justified—whether the dominant interest should not rather be en- 
couraged and guided to fuller expression by assistance with the technical 
difficulties as they arise. 
The study also suggests, from the evidence on the development of 
composition, that greater emphasis during the earlier period be placed 
upon the “cataloguing” phase of drawing—the portrayal of single ob- 
jects rather than the attempt to organize them into a unified picture.
-P-A-G-E-35
36 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
Only after a certain degree of power is attained in this phase, only as 
mental maturity indicates the dawning of descriptive or narrative power, 
should direct effort be made to stimulate children to the portrayal of 
nature scenes, stories, or other forms of related expression. 
In this respect, as in every other, wide individual variations among 
children indicate the necessity of individual treatment—of such adap- 
tation to individual needs and abilities that no child is forced beyond 
his powers, no child is arrested whose abilities are beyond the general 
level of the group, and each is stimulated to his own best achievement.

CHAPTER II 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCALES 
The examination of the content of the drawings having established 
the presence of certain dominant interests in drawing (whether native 
or acquired) the next step in the study was the construction of a series 
of scales based on these dominant interests, for the measurement of 
abilities. Thus far no account had been taken of differences in the 
merit of the drawings. The interest centered on the mental attitudes 
evidenced by the intent to represent certain ideas. Differences in merit 
could be accurately measured only by reference to objective standards. 
Such a standard is offered by a drawing scale. 
Scales for the measurement of abilities have been in existence since 
1910 when Thorndike published his “Scale for the Measurement of 
the Quality of Handwriting.” Dr. Thorndike said in presenting this 
scale: 
At present we can do no better than measure a handwriting as very bad, bad, good, 
very good, and extremely good, knowing only vaguely what we mean thereby; running 
the risk of shifting our standards with time, and only by chance meaning the same by 
the word as some other student of the facts means by it. We are in the condition in 
which students of temperature were before the discovery of the thermometer, or any 
other scale for measuring temperature, beyond the very hot, hot, warm, lukewarm, 
and the like, of subjective opinion.? 
The fourteen years intervening since the publication of this work have 
seen the rapid development of scale-making in two directions: (1) 
scales of subjects in which quality of result must be evaluated, com- 
monly known as “product scales,” such as handwriting and English 
composition; (2) scales of subjects, such as arithmetic and spelling, in 
which achievement can be measured by definite objective standards of 
speed, accuracy, and difficulty, commonly known as “performance 
scales.” Drawing obviously belongs to the former group. 
Two drawing scales are already in existence. The Thorndike scale 
appeared in 1913, the Kline-Carey scale in 1922. The question has 
therefore been asked, “Why not use one of these scales rather than 
1 Handwriting, p. 1. 
aE:
-P-A-G-E-37
  38 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
construct a new one?” The answer relative to the Thorndike scale is 
twofold. First, this scale is composed of drawings by children from 
eight to fifteen years of age, whereas our interest centered in the chil- 
dren from four to eight. The lower range of the Thorndike scale, the 
first eight or nine drawings, undoubtedly overlaps the work of the lower 
primary grades, the poorest of the drawings being decidedly poorer 
than the best achievement of even the four year group. But the lower 
limit of this scale is considerably better than our worst, and the several 
upper values are so far superior to our best that the range of the scale 
is not coincident with our needs. By constructing a new scale, from 
materials derived from our own group, all the steps may be adapted 
to our needs, and a finer gradation within these limits may be attained. 
In the second place, according to Thorndike’s statement, his scale 
is defective in that there is but one series, comprising a variety of sub- 
jects, so that it is difficult to determine the exact value of any drawing 
by comparison with a standard of its own kind. “If we had in the 
scale a series of drawings of flowers, a series of horses, of book covers, 
of women, etc., the scale would obviously be more useful to measure 
the merits of horses, book covers, flowers, and women than it now is.’ 
The Kline-Carey scale, published when ours was well under way, 
remedies the second difficulty by presenting four series, each made up 
of drawings of one subject—house, rabbit, boy running, and tree. The 
scale also comprises drawings from the kindergarten-primary group, but 
since its upper limit is the work of high school seniors only a small 
number of values are within the range of abilities of our children. A 
scale constructed with special reference to the abilities of this lower 
group seems justifiable, as supplementing the more ambitious projects. 
This scale was to comprise several subjects, each represented by a 
graded series of drawings, progressing from the worst to something 
beyond the probable best achievement of the kindergarten-primary 
group. In accordance with the evidence of major interests, three 
subjects were selected. Persons and houses were easily determined 
upon, as the consensus of all studies of the content of children’s draw- 
ings had shown them to have the greatest frequency. Following the 
evidence of our own study, trees became the logical third; but since 
trees almost always occurred in relation to other forms—as background 
of a story, setting for a bird’s nest, wigwam, house, etc.—it was de- 
cided that compositions involving trees be used. The scale is thus 
? Measurement of Achievement in Drawing, p. 33.
-P-A-G-E-38
  CONSTRUCTION OF THE SCALES 39 
limited in its application, but within its scope it becomes easier of 
application and more secure in its results. 
The subjects once selected, the next question to be answered con- 
cerned the type of values to be emphasized in the scales: should they 
measure primarily merit in representation or in artistic feeling and 
interpretation? Inasmuch as the drawings of these early years are 
generally conceded to be representative rather than esthetic in pur- 
pose, it was decided that the emphasis should be upon ability to ex- 
press ideas vividly, clearly and accurately. 
The general character of the scales having thus been defined, the 
collection of spontaneous drawing was again put into requisition for 
material from which the actual measures might be constructed. Such 
an embarrassing abundance of material presented itself that the first 
task was to reduce the supply to a workable basis. 
All the drawings were sorted into four groups—houses, persons, 
trees or compositions containing trees, and discard. In case any draw- 
ing could be placed in more than one group it was classed in accordance 
with its dominant subject. Next, each of the three selected groups 
was carefully examined and further reduced by a series of eliminations 
in the following manner: 
1. All drawings which did not conform to the instructions, either 
in size or tone of paper, omission of color, or use of wax crayon were 
tuthlessly discarded. 
2. In case of houses or human figures, those drawings in which the 
desired form occurred only as a detail subordinated to other forms 
were excluded. It was thought probable that such drawings were not 
typical of the children’s best in representing the single form. Frequently 
the house or person was sketchily drawn or so small as to give little 
indication of the child’s ability. Moreover it was thought that judg- 
ment would necessarily be biased by the context. 
3. In cases where drawings were quite identical in type and general 
merit, only one of the type was retained. These several processes 
reduced the total number of samples in each series to something over 
two thousand. 
4. Finally those drawings which were nearly identical in type and 
general merit were paired, placed face downward, and one member 
of each pair was discarded by chance. The drawings at the upper 
level of merit were not subjected to this step, however, since they were 
neither so numerous nor so nearly identical in value as those in the
-P-A-G-E-39
  40 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
middle and lower ranges. A few drawings of children slightly older, 
or mentally more mature, were added to each series, to ensure that the 
final scales would meet the requirements of other, possibly more gifted, 
children than ours. 
The drawings now comprised 1153 samples of human beings, 1122 
of houses, and 1070 of compositions. For the further steps in the 
construction of the scales the ratings of many competent judges were 
necessary. Three processes were used: (1) All the drawings were 
first graded roughly into groups according to merit, the total rating of 
the several judges being taken as the basis of a further reduction in 
numbers. (2) With these smaller groups, a second grading into groups 
was secured, and further eliminations followed. (3) There remained 
‘in each series thirty-four drawings, ranging from the poorest to the best, 
‘and, by the cruder methods thus far employed, representing fairly 
equal steps. These were now subjected to a more careful scrutiny, 
cand arranged in serial order according to merit, by a larger number of 
judges. On the basis of these ratings the scales were made. 
To describe the processes in detail: for the first step the 1070 or 
more samples of each set were graded by twelve judges, each of whom 
received the following instructions: 
Make ten groups of the drawings such that each group is separated from the next 
in merit by approximately an equal amount of difference. In other words, sort the 
-drawings into ten groups ranking from the best to the worst. In case any drawing 
has absolutely no merit, place it in a zero group. If any seems to you to have even 
less than zero merit, place it in a still lower group. If any drawing stands out as 
markedly better than the highest group, place it in a separate class. You will thus 
have possibly thirteen groups. 
In evaluating, each drawing is to be considered from the standpoint of its repre- 
sentative value, not artistic merit. Insofar as detail, accuracy, perspective, and 
proportion enter into its merit as the expression of an idea, these should be considered, 
and no further. 
The total score for each drawing of the three series as rated by these 
first twelve judges, in terms of the distribution, is shown in table 10. 
The average score for each may be obtained by dividing each score by 
twelve. These distributions only very roughly approach the normal 
curve—a result which was to be expected from the method of selection 
of the samples, since many of those in the middle range of values had 
been eliminated.

To determine the reliability of the judgments, in each series the first 
two hundred scores, which were assumed to be a random sampling of 
all the scores (the order was a purely chance arrangement), were used. 
The twelve judgments were divided, also by chance, into two sets of 
six judgments each, and the sums of the two sets of judgments respec- 
tively were calculated for each drawing. The two sets of values were 
then correlated, the Pearson formula 
=A ZB 
n 
1G) (=) n n 
being used, in which A represents the several values of the first set of 
six judgments, B the corresponding values for the second set, and ” 
the number of drawings correlated. The coefficients were, for human 
beings, .967, for houses .954, for compositions .851; with probable 
errors, respectively, of 0.0031, 0.0043, and 0.0133. 
The drawings were next distributed according to their values as 
measured by the sum of the twelve ratings above. From each numeri- 
cal rank one drawing was then selected on the basis of least deviation 
from the average score for this group. In the extreme upper and lower 
ranks, however, some drawings having the same rank were retained, =A B-—

because of the wider gaps in the distribution and the more varied charac- 
ter of the samples. This gave three sets of drawings which, according 
to the combined rating of the twelve judges, represented graded series 
of approximately equal steps. The method of selection was not refined, 
but was considered valid merely for purposes of elimination to a prac- 
tical working series. The new groupings contained 158 drawings of 
human beings, 128 of houses, and 122 of compositions. 
The second step was the grading of these smaller series by a larger 
number of judges. The instructions were the same as before, except 
that only eleven groups were to be made—one for zero and ten for 
higher degrees of merit than zero. Thirty judges rated each of these 
series—supervisors or teachers of kindergartens, primary grades, or art. 
The treatment of the results was by the more refined method of “per- 
centage of better and worse judgments.” This method, first applied 
to scale making by Thorndike, is based upon the theorem advanced by 
Fullerton and Cattell, that “differences which are equally often noticed 
are equal unless they are always noticed or never noticed.” 
The values were computed by determining just how many judges 
rated each drawing as better than, equal to, or worse than every other 
drawing in its own series. Equal judgments were converted into better 
or worse judgments by taking the average of two figures—one derived 
by dividing the equal judgments equally between the better and worse 
judgments, the other by dividing them proportionally. Those draw- 
ings were then selected which represented a graded series, of which 
each member had been rated as better than the one next below by ap- 
proximately 75 per cent of the judges. Thirty-four samples were 
retained in each series. 
In the two preceding stages, the original drawings were used, the 
samples subjected to the second rating having been mounted on a 
good quality of tagboard for preservation. For the third rating the 
samples were photographed. Thus the wear and tear on the original 
drawings was obviated, and, ten prints having been made from every 
sample, the process of judging was considerably expedited. 
These series of thirty-four samples each were then submitted, in 
photographic reproduction, to a larger group of judges for rating on a 
more refined basis. The instructions for this stage were: 
Arrange the drawings in a series from the best to the worst, so that, according to 
your judgment, each drawing represents a lesser degree of merit than the one preceding. 
In judging houses and persons, ignore all details of background, considering only the  
-P-A-G-E-43
  44 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
house or person. The basis of judgment in every case is to be representative value or 
meaning, rather than artistic merit. Determine which one of the drawings represents 
the nearest approach to zero value, zero being defined as an attempt to represent the 
idea, with just not any merit as representation. 
Sixty judges rated the houses, seventy-two the human beings, and 
eighty-four the compositions. The percentages of better and worse 
judgments were again computed for each pair of drawings in each series. 
The samples, with one or two exceptions, were discarded whose per- 
centages approached 50 or 100, on the assumption that a difference noted 
by 50 per cent of the judges means equality in the two samples, while 
a difference on which 100 per cent of the judges are agreed is measured 
with a high degree of unreliability. Seventy-five per cent agreement is 
taken as the point of maximum reliability, having a P.E. value 
of 1.00. Those samples were retained in the final scales which formed 
graded series, each specimen of which was rated as better than the one 
below it by approximately 75 per cent of the judges. 
The specimen with a median rating of zero was next determined for 
each series. The P.E. difference of the sample next above zero was 
then determined. This constituted its scale value. The P.E. differ- 
ence between each sample and the one next above having been deter- 
mined, the amount of this difference was added to the score of the lower 
sample. These sums constituted the scale values for the several draw- 
ings of each series. 
The complete data for the samples finally selected for the three 
scales are presented in tables 11 and 12. Table 11 shows successively 
the values assigned by the three groups of judges to the several drawings, 
first of human beings, next of houses, and last of compositions. The 
drawings are numbered as in the original series. Columns 1 to 3 give 
the ratings of the first twelve judges. Reading down the column, 
drawing number 430, the best of the series of human beings, was rated 
better than number 566, the second best, by nine of the twelve judges. 
Number 566 was rated better than number 582, the third best, by ten 
of the judges, etc. The second column shows the number of judges who 
considered each drawing worse than the one next below. The third 
shows the number of judges who placed the two drawings in the same 
group. 
The same data for the thirty judges who rated the smaller number 
of drawings are presented in columns 4 to 6. Columns 7 to 9 combine 
the results of the first and second ratings as given in the preceding

divided equally between the better and worse. This, however, mani- 
festly distorts the probabilities, since the chances are that, if these 
drawings had been directly compared with one another, the drawing 
which was rated higher by the greater number of judges would have 
been rated higher by a proportionately larger number of those who In column 10 the equal judgments are

placed the two drawings in the same rank. Column 11 distributes the 
equal judgments on this principle. For example, if 75 per cent of those 
who rated the two drawings as unequal in merit rated drawing A as 
better that drawing B, then 75 per cent of the equal ratings were as- 
signed to drawing A and 25 per cent to drawing B. This method prob- 
ably distorts the results in the opposite direction, especially in those 
cases where all or nearly all the judgments were either better or equal, 
and where, therefore, all the equal judgments were thrown with the 
better ones. Column 12 is a compromise arrived at by taking the 
average of the two preceding columns. 
This computation has been made merely to show the amount of 
correlation between the preliminary and final ratings. The twelve 
and thirty judges rated the drawings by placing them in a limited num- 
ber of groups—from 11 to 13. The probability is that few of the draw- 
ings were directly compared with one another. Moreover, the small 
number of groups provided threw together in one group drawings of 
several degrees of merit. The large number of samples to be evaluated, 
especially by the first twelve judges, makes it probable that there were 
some shiftings of standards in the progress of the grouping. For all 
these reasons these ratings are less reliable than the final ones. They 
were therefore used only as a means of elimination in selecting the 
smaller series from which the scales were constructed. They were not 
included in the final computation for the scales. 
The percentile values of the final ratings are shown in column 13, 
for purposes of comparison. It will be seen that in every case the two 
sets of judges agree on the superior merit of the upper drawing of each 
pair. The correlation coefficients computed by the formula, 
=A ZB

(za = = (20 a =) n n 
are not high, the values for the three series, human beings, houses, 
and compositions respectively, being .46, .24, and .28, but they 
are all positive. 
The steps by which the scale values were obtained are presented in 
table 12. Column 1 repeats the percentile values of the ratings by 
the final judges. Column 2 shows the P.E., based upon this percentile 
difference between each adjacent pair of drawings. In column 3

the actual scale value of each drawing is computed by adding its PE. 
value to the sum of those below it in rank. Column 4 shows the value 
finally assigned, which is the same as that of the preceding column, 
reduced to one decimal place.

In order to make the results of the manipulation of the three scales 
more directly comparable in their application to practical problems, 
the scores for compositions were multiplied by two. This in no way 
affects the reliability of the scale values. 
The scales themselves are presented in figures 4, 5, and 6 (see folders). 
In a number of instances in the selection of each series, two drawings 
had approximately equal rank. In such cases the rejected drawing 
frequently appeared to have value as supplementing the one selected, 
giving a sample of somewhat different type; for example, a man in 
profile, when the chosen sample showed the full-face, a house with 
gable roof, when the chosen sample had a flat roof, etc. These draw- 
ings are presented in figures 4 A, 5 A, and 6 A (pages 50-53).

  CHAPTER IIT 
Tue APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 
Three measuring instruments were now available for the further 
study of the drawings. The next problem of the Committee was 
the application of these instruments to the materials at hand. Their 
first purpose was to test the reliability of the scales themselves. Three 
criteria are frequently used to determine the reliability of a series of 
measures. The first is the distribution of the scores. If the measures 
are reliable, the scores for an unselected group should approach the 
normal curve of distribution: there should be a large number of cases 
in the middle range and a gradually decreasing number of cases as 
they approach the upper and lower limits. 
A second criterion applicable to scales is that the measures, if applied 
to unselected groups of several ages should reveal definite progress 
from year to year. A third criterion is their objectivity. A scale 
is perfectly objective when identical results are secured from ratings 
of the same material by different examiners. The application of these 
three criteria—approximation to the normal curve of distribution, 
increase in the average score for each increase in chronological age, 
and identity or close agreement in the ratings of different examiners— 
gives evidence of reliability. 
The use of the scales in measuring the material collected offered 
opportunities for interesting comparisons. What is the norm and the 
range of variation to be expected among children of any one chronologi- 
cal age? Just how much more is to be expected of five year old children 
in drawing achievement than of four year olds? Are there significant 
sex differences either in the amount of ability or in its direction? 
Are there, apart from the differences of chronological age, significant 
changes from grade to grade? Does the six year old child in second 
grade differ in any way from the less accelerated six year old in first 
grade? How do the several cities represented in the study compare 
with one another in their achievement as indicated by these samples? 
Finally, how closely is drawing ability correlated with general intelli- 
gence? Does the child of highest intelligence always manifest the 
highest skill in graphic representation? Is the child of high intelligence

APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 55 
always inferior in graphic art? Or is there some degree of correlation 
between these two extremes, or none at all? All of these questions 
suggested themselves. 
As the first step in the construction of the scales all the drawings 
collected had been classified for the three subjects—human beings, 
houses, and compositions—and those which could not be included in 
any one of these groups had been thrown into the discard: The three 
classes were now subjected to careful rating by the scales. 
In order that the subjective element might be reduced to a minimum, 
three judges—the chairman and two assistants—rated each drawing. 
These judges were first instructed in the use of the scales, and rated 
a considerable number of drawings, under supervision and criticism, 
before the final evaluation was undertaken. Each judge in turn then 
rated each specimen independently, recording its scale value on the 
back of the drawing. After the three judgments had been made, their 
average value was determined. This became the final score of the 
specimen. 
In this way all the drawings of the original collection which were 
comparable to the three scales were evaluated. In addition a number 
of drawings of four and eight year old children which had later come 
into our hands were measured. In all, 7432 drawings of human beings, 
7708 of houses, and 6543 of compositions—a total of 21,683 drawings— 
were thus measured. 
The results of this process for each subject are presented in the form 
of a general summary of the distributions for each of the grades and 
for the whole group, by sexes and ages, in tables 13, 14 and 15. The 
facts of the final summary, combining the three grades and the two sexes 
for each age, are shown graphically in figures 7,8 and 9 (pages 68-70). For 
this purpose, the original data have been reduced to a percentile basis. 
From an examination of the three figures it is evident that there is 
an approach to the normal curve of distribution. Some irregularities 
are due to the fact that the scale values do not present a perfectly 
regular series, progressing by equal increments; for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 
or 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Hence the number of cases for certain values, which 
represent the averages from exceptional combinations, would necessarily 
be smaller than those for the adjacent values. This is particularly true 
of compositions. 
It is evident, from the tables, that there is in each subject a steady 
rise in the score from year to year, except that in the cases of houses and

  APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 71 
human beings there is a slight drop at eight years and six months. 
This may be accounted for either as a chance deviation from the 
normal tendency, due to a small number of cases, or, quite as prob- 
ably, as a true deviation, due to the mentally retarded character 
of the older children. 
In the range of distribution there is enormous overlapping from year 
to year. The most gifted four year old children reach or exceed the 
median score for eight year old children, and, vice versa, the least 
gifted of the eight year group only approximate the median for the 
youngest kindergarten children; but in every case, either the lower 
end of the curve for any younger group is below the lower end of the 
curve for the next older group or the frequency for the lowest scores 
is greater for the younger children. Also the upper end of the curve 
for the older group is nearly always above the upper end of the curve 
for the next lower group. No eight year child draws as poorly as the 
poorest four year old, and no four year child draws as well as the best 
eight year child. 
Thus far the reliability of the scales is demonstrated. The distribu- 
tion approaches the normal curve, and there is consistent rise in the 
norm from year to year. For the third test, the objectivity of the 
judgments, the ratings of the three judges on a hundred random sam- 
ples of the drawings were compared by the correlation formula, 
TAB . es See a Saie =e

v _ (24) PB (28) n n n n 
in which A and B are used to represent the values assigned to the 
hundred specimens by judges A and B respectively and m represents 
the number of drawings. By this formula, the ratings of judges A 
and B, A and C, and B and C for each subject were correlated. The 
coefficients of correlation are as follows:

-P-A-G-E-71
  72 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
That the judgments are not identical is due in part to the subjective 
factor. Each judge undoubtedly emphasizes different elements in 
rating the complex whole which is presented in each drawing; interprets 
from a slightly different viewpoint. In many instances, however, 
slight differences are not necessarily due to the subjectivity of the 
ratings. They may result from the fact that many drawings do not 
exactly represent the scale value. They may be located at some point 
between two adjacent values. In case the drawing is midway between 
two values, by chance half of the judgments would fall on the value 
just above and half on the value just below the true value. In such 
cases disagreement would lead to greater accuracy in the final score. 
The high correlations indicate a considerable degree of objectivity in 
the scales. The scale for houses is evidently most objective while 
that for compositions is the least. 
It seems justifiable therefore to use the medians and deviations dis- 
covered as tentative norms for the further study of the drawings. Age 
differences have already been referred to. Grade differences are also 
significant. Do children of the same chronological age draw equally 
well, irrespective of scholastic attainment? Presumably, the five 
and six year old children in first grade are mentally maturer than those 
in the kindergarten, and six year old children in the second grade are 
mentally maturer than those in the first grade. This presumption 
seems more than justified because of the unfortunate school tradition 
which dictates that promotion from kindergarten to first grade shall 
be determined wholly by chronological age. Children are promoted 
at the beginning of the school term nearest the sixth birthday, regard- 
less of mental maturity. Hence only the phenomenally precocious 
five year old child is usually found in first grade, and only the very 
superior child reaches the second grade before seven years. 
Do these children then draw better than those of their ages who are 
making just normal progress or who are slightly retarded? The facts 
are summarized in table 16, in terms of the median score for each age 
in each grade. 
Two general tendencies are evident. Comparing first the medians 
for the several ages within each grade (reading across the page), with 
one exception, we find consistent progress from year to year. Chrono- 
logical maturity apparently brings fairly constant improvement in 
drawing ability, irrespective of school progress.
-P-A-G-E-72
  APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 73 
Looking next at the medians for the three grades (reading down 
the page) we find that with two exceptions there is definite increase 
in the score for every age from grade to grade (in the two exceptional 
groups the number of cases, 50 and 30 respectively, is relatively small). 
The five and six year old children in first grade rank higher than those 
in the kindergarten. The six year old children in the second grade 
rank higher than those in the first, etc. 
Several explanations may be offered. It is possible that those pupils 
who have advanced to higher classes, having been exposed to the 
stimulus of maturer children, have profited by their responses. It is

possible that the instruction in drawing improves from grade to grade, 
though this may be seriously doubted. Finally, it may be that accelera- 
tion in school progress and ability to draw are both the result of a 
common cause—superior “general intelligence’—or to a group of 
correlated causes. Further evidence will be presented on this point. 
It is quite possible that the first and third factors are both operative. 
Certain sex differences appear. According to the median scores, 
boys and girls are nearly equal in the quality of their representations 
of houses, with a slight advantage (0.1 per cent) in the total score in 
favor of the girls. Girls draw the human figure considerably better
-P-A-G-E-73
SOO ee eC Un EE A SO RRO FREE eget ere 
74 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
than boys (0.7 per cent for the combined median for all the groups). 
This superiority, while not great, is consistent through all the years of 
all the grades. On the other hand, boys excel in the drawing of com- 
positions (0.5 per cent for the combined median) except in the kinder- 
garten group, where the combined median for the several ages is 0.2 
per cent higher for the girls. Even here, the boys equal the girls at 
five, and in the six-year-six-months and seven-year groups. The data 
suggest that girls are more interested and therefore excel in the repre- 
sentation of detail, of single objects, whereas boys are more interested 
and therefore excel in the representation of objects in relation to one 
another. 
Since the age-grade distribution of the drawings varies considerably, 
no valid comparison of the records for the cities represented could be 
made with the data in their original form. As the most convenient 
measure of the differences due to geographical distribution—and, prob- 
ably, to the quality of instruction—the percentage of children in each 
city reaching or exceeding the median for all children of their respec- 
tive ages was calculated. For example, for city A, the number of 
drawings of persons by four year old children which were equal to, or 
better than, the median rating for four year old children in general, 
was counted. This sum was then converted into a percentile value, 
based on the total number of drawings of persons by four year old 
children in city A. The same was done for all years and for the three 
subjects. The grade scores were kept separate, but the age scores within 
each grade were combined to form the total score for that grade. This 
provides a rough measure of the difference in drawing achievement 
from grade to grade within each city and from city to city. The figures 
are given in tables 17, 18 and 19 (pages 75-77). For obvious reasons, 
the symbols for the cities have been arbitrarily assigned. 
Each table gives first the number of drawings of the subject in ques- 
tion, by grades and then in total. This represents the number of cases 
on which the percentages are based. Since the total amount of material 
sent by the cities differed considerably, and the number of drawings 
for each subject depended upon the choice of the individual children, 
there is a wide variation in the number of drawings from each city for 
each subject. The reliability of the score of any city depends upon the 
number of drawings included in it. Obviously a score based on 8, 
or even 30 drawings has no diagnostic value for that city, while a score 
based upon a hundred or more random samplings should have con- 
siderable reliability.
-P-A-G-E-74
  APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 1S 
There is manifestly a wide deviation in the ratings of the various 
cities. The percentages reaching or exceeding the median range from 
21.0 to 88.3. The final composite scores (table 19A) which give the 
average achievement for the 3 forms for all grades and ages, range

from 71.5 to 33.7. There is however a fair degree of uniformity in the 
position of each city for the several measures. In eight of the twenty- 
seven cities all the scores are grouped consistently either above or 
below the median. Five others have all but one of their scores on the 
same side of the median line.

In these, only those cities, nineteen in all, are included for which all

experiences, and those which drew poorly showed equal poverty in the 
variety of ideas they attempted to express. Since these facts relate 
to many children, located in numbers of schools, it seems fair again 
to infer that instruction, or lack of instruction, in drawing has been 
responsible for the differences. 
It is not assumed that the norms established in this study, and used 
as a basis for comparison, are true norms. The number of cases in each 
age group is too limited for such an assumption. Many thousands of 
drawings should be rated, and their scores combined before any valid 
norms of achievement could be secured. As tentative standards how- 
ever, these medians have served their purpose in determining the rela- 
tive merits of the drawings studied. 
It must also be emphasized that the method of comparison, using 
the per cent reaching or exceeding the median, gives at best but a rough 
measure, since it does not take into account how far the drawings of 
any city exceed or fall below the median. In fact, if this were con- 
sidered, the differences between cities would be far greater. The 
cities varying about the median had many drawings near the median 
level, whereas those in which there is a high per cent above the median 
had numbers of drawings of a very high degree of excellency and those 
in which the per cent reaching the median is low had an equal propor- 
tion of markedly inferior work. This is in accordance with the theory 
of probabilities underlying the normal curve of distribution. 
A further application of the scales was made in the study of the small 
number of drawings by retarded children received from the first and 
second grades. These were rated in the same manner as the rest. The 
ratings were then compared with the median for eight years, six months, 
and the percentage of each age reaching or exceeding that median was 
computed. The results are shown in table 20 (page 82). 
The numbers are too small for safe inference. They are presented 
as suggestive of possibilities for future study. For the nine and ten 
year groups it seems significant that, with the exception of drawings 
of the human figure they fall considerably below the norms with which 
they are compared. Since these norms are for younger children, it is 
probable that the retarded children are quite inferior in drawing ability 
to normal children of their own ages.

Two cities having large foreign populations had the nationality of 
the young artist recorded along with the other information on the back 
of the drawing. Again the numbers are too limited for any conclusions 
to be drawn, but they are presented as suggestive for further investi- 
gation (table 21).

  CHAPTER IV 
THE APPLICATION OF THE SCALES (Continued) 
CORRELATION WITH GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 
One of the problems of major interest to those undertaking this 
study was the relation of drawing ability to intelligence. Some pre- 
vious investigators have given evidence of this same interest, but no 
definite measurements, so far as is known, have been made. Lay! 
states that in an experiment in drawing and modeling which he con- 
ducted “five children of low rank showed surprising independence in 
this new field.” 
Kerschensteiner® states that graphic skill generally goes with intel- 
lectual ability, but the converse is not necessarily true: intellectual 
ability does not go with ability in drawing. The best drawing, however, 
comes from children making the best school reports. The greatest 
artists have also been great thinkers. Nevertheless, superior drawing 
frequently comes from children of the socially inferior classes—from the 
families of cabinet-makers and other hand workers, rather than from 
the wealthy and upper classes. 
Hall? quotes from Ivanoff that there is a positive correlation between 
drawing and intelligence, and that this correlation is higher with girls 
than with boys: if a girl draws well she is more likely to be a good 
scholar than is the boy of like ability. Good drawers usually do well 
in history and geography, both of which involve visual memory. Arith- 
metic is less closely related, but more commonly with girls than with 
boys. Drawing is more closely related to manual abilities than to any 
language studies. Defects in drawing however are attributed by 
Ivanoff chiefly to mental causes—sensory defects, weak mental content, 
an optic image incapable of guiding the hand, lack of attentive power, 
etc. None of these writers gives the data on which his conclusions are 
based.

  APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 85 
In order that definite measurements might be made, it was deter- 
mined to secure drawings from a considerable number of children whose 
intelligence had been measured by a standardized test. For this pur- 
pose the Leland Stanford Revision of the Binet-Simon test was selected, 
as the best standardized and most widely used measure for kinder- 
garten-primary children. Since it was not practicable for the Committee 
to conduct these tests with anything like an adequate number of sub- 
jects, an appeal was made to a number of schools and school systems 
where the tests had been given under satisfactory conditions. From 
public or private schools of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, 
Denver, Detroit, Grand Rapids, New York City, Pasadena, Richmond, 
Va., and Ypsilanti came favorable responses. 
Directions were then sent to the teachers for securing a series of 
three drawings—one of each subject of the scales—from every child 
tested. In this case the subject of the drawing was to be imposed, 
but the mode of representation was to be left as free as possible. On 
every drawing was to be recorded the age and sex of the child, and his 
intelligence quotient. 
On receipt of the drawings all of those for which the data were com- 
plete were subjected to the same process of evaluation as the earlier 
specimens. They were rated by the three judges, and the average 
tating for each drawing was determined. Next, the average for the 
three drawings was computed. Finally, this was converted into a 
“drawing quotient,” by dividing it by the average of the three medians 
for the age group to which the child belonged. The method is not 
so refined as the usual achievement quotient, because the medians used 
were determined for six months periods, whereas the usual method is 
based upon smaller chronological intervals. Moreover, the achieve- 
ment quotient is usually computed as the ratio of the chronological 
age to the age value assigned to the product that is being rated. For 
our purposes, the method seemed justifiable since it gave a result vary- 
ing directly with the ratio of the child’s achievement to that of his 
age group, and one which was comparable to the intelligence quotient, 
in that it remained constant from year to year. 
The “drawing quotient” having thus been determined for each set 
of 3 drawings, its correlation with the intelligence quotient was cal- 
culated by the formula: 
=A ZB   
zAB— 
y(z# a oe”) (20 s er) n n r= 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  86 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
The computations were made first for each half year interval, and 
then for the group as a whole. Table 22 gives the results. 
Considering first the coefficient for the total number of drawings, it 
is evident that there is a positive relationship between drawing achieve- 
ment and intelligence, but the degree of relationship is not high. Ac- 
cording to the P.E., the reliability of this correlation—the probability 
that it would generally hold true of random samplings of drawings— 
is considerable. On the basis of this value solely, it might be assumed 
that ability in drawing and general intelligence will accompany each 
other somewhat frequently. Children above the average in one will 
deviate in the same direction in the other by about 35 per cent.

When we consider the values of r for the several ages, however, the 
situation is obscured. There appears to be a gradual rise in correla- 
tion from practically no correlation at four years to 62.3 at six years, 
then a drop to practically nothing at seven years six months, witha 
rise to 0.634 and 0.572 respectively, at eight years and eight years six 
months. 
If we considered only the figures to 6 years inclusive, it might be 
inferred that drawing ability tended to rise in its correlation with in- 
telligence because the more intelligent child responds more readily to 
the stimulus of school environment and instruction. The four year 
child, having newly arrived in school has not yet been exposed to school 
influences for a sufficient time to ensure his favorable reaction to it.
-P-A-G-E-86
  APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 87 
Moreover, it is quite probable that the intelligence quotient for the 
four year child is somewhat less reliable than that of maturer children, 
because of the far greater difficulty in securing the codperation of the 
younger child in the test. Owing to both these factors, it might be 
anticipated that the correlation would rise with chronological age. 
The six year child does react favorably in most cases to the test situa- 
tion, and the amount of exposure of 6 year children to drawing in- 
struction is far more uniform. The sudden drop in the coefficient at 
six years six months however, is not explicable on this basis—or on any 
basis now apparent to us. 
It is quite possible that the rise at eight years is due to the selected 
nature of the group from which most of these drawings were received. 
By the usual organization of primary schools most of the eight year 
children of normal and supernormal intelligence have been eliminated 
from the first and second grades. The eight year groups therefore, 
are highly selected for subnormality. This is proven by a comparison 
of the medians of the intelligence quotients for these ages with those 
for all the children represented. The median for the intelligence quo- 
tients of the 1420 children is 102.9, whereas the median for the eight 
year group is 90, for the eight year six months group 82. 
It is quite probable that the correlation is higher for the lower orders 
of intelligence. This is somewhat contrary to Kerschenstimer’s con- 
clusion. The chances are greater that inferior ability in drawing will 
accompany markedly inferior intelligence than the converse. How- 
ever, in considering individuals, there were numbers of children of 
quite low intelligence who showed considerable skill in drawing, as 
well as several children of high intelligence who were deficient in 
drawing. 
The inference that correlation between representative power and 
intelligence is closer at the lower end of the scale is corroborated by 
a comparison of the quartile distribution for the two measures. For 
this purpose, the values for the four quartiles for both intelligence 
quotient and drawing quotient were determined. They were for in- 
telligence, 48-93, 94-103, 104-113, 114-172; for drawing, 48-97, 98- 
106, 107-116, 117-195. The number of children whose drawing 
quotients for each quartile fell within the several quartiles of the 
intelligence quotients was then determined. 
These values were translated into graphic form in figure 12. The 
figure is to be interpreted: for the lowest quartile of the intelligence

quotients, the drawing quotients of 161 children fell in the same quartile, 
114 in the second, 58 in the third, and 24 in the fourth. For the second 
quartile of intelligence quotients, the drawing quotients of 93 children 
fell within the first quartile, 105 in the second, 81 in the third, and 66 
in the fourth, etc. 
The figure brings out clearly the fact of the wide variability of the 
two scores. Twenty-four children with intelligence quotients of 94 or 
less were among the upper 25 per cent in drawing achievement, while 
46 children whose intelligence placed them in the upper 25 percentile 
had drawing scores in the lowest quartile of all the children. On 
the other hand, in all except the third quartile of intelligence, for which 
the upper quartile of drawing quotients is slightly higher, the number 
of children whose drawing quotients fall within the same quartile is 
greater than any other. That the overlapping should be considerable 
in the middle 50 per cent was to be expected. 
A significant fact is that for the lowest quartile of intelligence the 
number of children with superior ability in drawing is considerably 
less than the converse for the upper quartile—24 to 46. Stated in 
another way, while only 6.8 per cent of the children in the lowest group 
for general intelligence excelled in drawing, 13 per cent of those in the 
highest group were markedly deficient in drawing. 
The assumption seems justified that while individuals of very low 
mentality are rarely superior in graphic representation, it is not gener- 
ally to be expected that intellectually brilliant individuals will excel in 
graphic arts. Drawing is probably a specialized ability, which never- 
theless involves elements dependent upon such mental traits as ac- 
curate observation, clear memory images, attention, and susceptibility 
to instruction. 
These general conclusions, while offered only tentatively, are in line 
with the evidence previously presented: that achievement in drawing 
among children of the same chronological age increases from grade to 
grade, and that over-age children in the first and second grades are 
usually less proficient in drawing than the pupils of the normal ages 
for these grades. 
EDUCATIONAL CONCLUSIONS 
Some educational corollaries may be suggested. Concerning the 
feeble-minded group it may be said that proficiency in drawing, or 
any of the expressive types of manual arts, should not be expected.
-P-A-G-E-89
90 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
For these pupils, emphasis should be placed wholly upon those types 
of manipulative activity in which manual skill alone is necessary for 
expertness; for example, basketry or weaving. 
Of the mentally superior, however, it cannot be prognosticated that 
they will excel in drawing. They may or may not, although it is prob- 
ably true that in the greatest artists technical draughtmanship is united 
with superior mentality. 
That children moderately or even poorly endowed with intellectual 
gifts may excel in manual expression is especially significant. In the 
adaptation of instruction to individual differences these children may 
be led to feel and develop the power they have, finding immediate 
satisfactions in congenial activity, incentives to greater effort in other 
directions, and a hope for the future in vocations of intrinsic worth 
and social value—in the broad field of industrial arts. 
The recognition of these differences has been urged many times. 
Thorndike says, 
Individual intellects can be divided roughly into two classes: those able to work 
with ideas and those able to work with things. Some children manage numbers, 
words, parts of speech, chemical symbols, and the like, but fail relatively in measuring 
boards, catching fish, cooking meals or making toys. They are the idea thinkers. 
Others make little headway with their arithmetic, grammar or text-book in chem- 
istry but succeed in the shop, the woods and the laboratory. They are the thing 
thinkers. . . ee 
Schools have hitherto been managed primarily in the interest of the idea thinkers. 
It has been left for shops, trades and the practical activities of life to give the other 
group the training which their natures crave. Moreover teachers, who are likely to 
be of the idea thinker type are, as a consequence, likely to be unfair to the thing 
thinkers—to look down on the children who do not do well in their typical school 
studies, however great their practical talents may be. But obviously the world needs 
both; the school should give opportunity for both; the teacher should esteem both.! 
Clearly, the child artist of mediocre mental gifts should be classed 
with the “thing thinkers.” The kindergarten, with its emphasis upon 
the manual arts, has frequently done full justice to this class. Perhaps 
this emphasis has been responsible for the fact that the kindergarten 
teacher’s judgment on the intelligence and promise of her pupils has 
frequently been found mistaken when her children pass on to the pri- 
mary school. The primary teacher, burdened with the responsibility 
of imparting the three R’s, may just as frequently neglect to discover 
and encourage the “thing thinker.”

APPLICATION OF THE SCALES 91 
Finally, the positive correlation between drawing and general in- 
telligence indicates that the two are not antagonistic. The majority 
of those who draw best are in the upper levels of intelligence. For 
these children drawing and other forms of manual expression offer all 
the educational values suggested above, and for the future, avocational 
interests of great worth, with the added possibility, in the case of the 
gifted few, of contributing to the development of artistic genius.

CHAPTER V 
PossiBLE USES OF THE SCALES 
The applications of the scales thus far made have in no way ex- 
hausted the possibilities of their use. In fact, the ground has only 
been broken, and the Committee hopes that its product will become a 
helpful instrument in the hands of class-room teachers, administrators, 
and research workers. Certain practical points in their application 
must therefore be made clear. 
Since the scales comprise only three subjects, it is obvious that the 
first essential is to secure drawings in which these three subjects con- 
stitute the dominant ideas. The most valuable specimens would 
doubtless be those produced spontaneously in the course of the days’ 
activities. However, since this might entail considerable delay in 
securing complete returns from a class, it has been found justifiable 
to assign the drawings as class exercises, providing sufficient motivation 
to ensure interest and the maximum of effort. 
In the instructions given to the teachers who contributed the sam- 
ples used in the study of correlation with intelligence, the following 
suggestions were offered: 
The drawings, to be strictly comparable to the scales, should be done with wax 
crayons of neutral tone (brown or black) and on drawing paper 6 by 9 inches. We 
wish three drawings from each child: (1) a person (man, woman or child), (2) a house, 
and (3) a composition containing trees. The mode of procedure may be adapted to 
your general method. If the children are accustomed to individual activities, the 
suggestions may be made to each individual, at an opportune moment; or if they are 
accustomed to group instruction, the lesson may be given at a regular drawing or 
manual arts period. 
The essential conditions are (1) that the work be properly motivated to secure the 
interest and best effort of each child; and (2) that each one express the idea without 
aid, suggestion, or criticism from teacher or other children. With kindergarten 
children, not more than one subject should be presented at one period. 
The following approach is suggested: “I want you to draw a picture for me today. 
I am going to send all your pictures on the train to some one far away. A great 
many other children are going to draw the same kind of picture, and I hope that 
each one of you will do your very best, so that I may be proud of yours. Will you 
each draw a picture of a house? The very best house you can make!” 
92
-P-A-G-E-92
  POSSIBLE USES OF THE SCALES 93 
For the second drawing, “You remember the houses you drew for me yesterday 
(the other day)? I liked them very much. Now will you make me a picture of a 
man, or a lady, or a little boy, or a little girl who lives in the house? Which would 
you rather make? (Allow children to express their preferences freely.) Remember 
to do your very best, for this picture is going far away for other people to see, and I 
want to be proud of you.” 
For the third, ‘““You have made two pictures for me—a house and some people to 
live init. Let us play that this family lived in the country (or near the park). Will 
you make me a picture with some trees in it to show that they lived in the country 
(or near the park)? Every one of you is going to try just as hard as you did before, 
so that this picture will be the best of all.” 
Other incentives would of course be offered. The one indispensable 
condition is that the samples be secured without previous preparation— 
instruction, suggestion or drill—and that no guidance or help be given 
to any individual during the drawing. Sufficient time should be al- 
lowed for each child to finish his product to his own satisfaction, without 
interruption or hurry. 
All three subjects should be secured from each individual, since no 
one of them is a fair measure of his general ability in drawing. This 
was indicated in the graph showing the scores of a number of cities 
in drawing the three forms (fig. 11). While in most cases the scores 
for the three were fairly close together, in some instances they varied 
considerably—from 15 to 30 per cent. These scores represent the 
attainments of different children, but a comparison of the three draw- 
ings of one child reveals similar inequalities. 
Before attempting to use the scales for practical or scientific purposes, 
some practise is necessary. Using any available samples of the sub- 
jects, compare each one independently to the appropriate scale. Plac- 
ing it beside the scale, approach its approximate value from each 
direction. Starting from the highest scale value, or from one unques- 
tionably above the sample, compare with each value until the drawing 
most like the sample is reached. Then, starting from the lower limit of 
the scale, or from a value unquestionably lower than the sample, proceed 
upward until the value most like the sample is reached. If the two values 
are not identical, the midpoint or average of the two may be used as 
the measure of this sample. In case the drawing is very different in 
character from the specimen of its approximate value in the scale, ex- 
amine the series of supplementary drawings for the nearest equivalent. 
Note the assigned value on the back of the drawing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  
94 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
After a number of drawings (perhaps fifty) have been rated in this 
way, repeat the process, recording the second score with the first, and 
noting the difference between the two scores. Thorndike says that 
three hours’ practise with the handwriting scale will bring considerable 
facility in its use. The same amount of practise with the drawing 
scales, if properly checked up for deviations in the successive ratings, 
should result in sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. 
Since in the use of every product scale there is a considerable sub- 
jective element, greater accuracy is secured if each sample is rated 
by two or more judges, the average of the results constituting the final 
measure. A second, somewhat less reliable, method is for one person 
to rate the drawings several times, taking the average of the several 
results as the final measure. 
Variations of one or even two points in the ratings may not be an in- 
dication of error, since the complexity of the qualities rated may war- 
rant some latitude in judging, according to the quality emphasized; 
and also since some drawings may have a true value midway between 
two points on the scale. The chances are that repeated ratings, either 
by the same or different judges will serve to compensate for these 
uncertainties. 
The drawings of each subject having been rated as accurately as 
possible, and sorted according to ages, the central tendency, either in 
terms of the median or average, may be determined for each age group. 
While the average is the more familiar measure, the median is more 
reliable for scientific purposes, as it is not influenced by small numbers 
of cases falling near the upper or lower limits of the distribution. 
The central tendencies may then be compared to the norms estab- 
lished for the several ages, to determine the general level of achieve- 
ment. These norms, derived from tables 13, 14 and 15, are repro- 
duced for convenience in table 23. 
As in this investigation, the comparison may be made more quickly 
and easily by determining the number of drawings that are equal to or 
better than the standards for their respective ages, and converting 
this total into a percentile value, based on the total number of draw- 
ings rated. By this method, a percentile value of 50 would indicate 
achievement exactly equal to the norm. Any percentage less than 
50 indicates proficiency below the norm. Any percentage above 50 
signifies proficiency above the norm thus far established.
-P-A-G-E-94
  POSSIBLE USES OF THE SCALES 95 
In order that these norms may be made more reliable by the inclu- 
sion of a far greater number of cases, the Committee would be glad 
to have reports on any groups of children tested. Blanks are provided 
for this purpose. 
The class-room teacher however should be concerned not only with 
the general level of her class, but with the individual achievement of 
every child in the group. The individual scores, as compared with the 
central tendency either for the class or for the larger groups represented 
in this study, should indicate more definitely than the opinion of the 
teacher which children have special aptitudes for drawing, and which

children need special stimulation and guidance in order that they 
may obtain the maximum of educational value from this form of self- 
expression. 
The scales may be used a number of times during the year as a means 
of measuring progress, but the drawings of the scales should never be 
used as models for imitation by the children. While the handwriting 
scales have been profitably and legitimately used in the class-room as 
incentives in the teaching of handwriting, their several degrees of 
merit offering to each child an attainable goal just in advance of his 
present attainment, scales for the representative arts should have a 
different status. 
Drawing is not, like handwriting, merely a manual art, depending 
wholly upon motor skill for its development. It is a form of self-expres-
-P-A-G-E-95
  96 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
sion, in which spontaneity and freedom, proceeding from individual 
thinking and imagery, are vital to real proficiency. The mechanical 
imitation of a model is inimical to progress because it discourages initia- 
tive and the search for clarity of imagery. It tends to fix habits of 
conventional reproduction. A class which, early in its kindergarten 
experience, had been taught by imitation to draw a flower crudely, 
using a rotary movement over and over, and adding a vertical line for a 
stem, remained content to draw flowers in this way the balance of the 
year. Another class of the same social status in the same city, with 
free representation, wise criticism, and frequent reference to living 
models, in the same period acquired a power which enabled them 
to represent tulips and jonquils of real individuality, beauty and 
naturalness. 
So in drawing the human form or houses or compositions, suggestion, 
with reference to the living model, to the products of children in ad- 
vance of the group, to a wide range of pictures (not too complex for 
real appreciation) should stimulate to greater effort and more satis- 
factory results; but the mechanical reproduction of any one model is 
dangerous and stultifying. The scales especially are not intended as 
models on which to base instruction, or by which to limit the self- 
expression of children, but purely as measuring instruments for as- 
signing values to the results attained by sound educational methods. 
To supervising officers, the scales should be of service in comparing 
the achievement, within the system, of group with group, school with 
school, or grade with grade; and in comparing the work of the system 
as a whole with that of other school systems. 
It may frequently happen, as was illustrated by the graph comparing 
the work of the three grades in nineteen cities (figure 10), that the 
promise of the kindergarten is not fulfilled in the primary grades; that 
the work of kindergarten and first grade is brought to an untimely end in 
the second; or occasionally that better work in the second grade brings 
up the standard that has lagged in the two lower grades. The scale, 
as a definite objective measure, makes clear these differences and stimu- 
lates to greater effort, or better methods, the failing teacher. It may 
also aid in bringing to light the relative values of different methods of 
teaching. 
To those interested in the scientific study of education a number of 
problems are suggested for solution. Several of the studies initiated 
in this investigation need to be pursued further. Among these one
-P-A-G-E-96
  POSSIBLE USES OF THE SCALES 97 
of the most fundamental is the establishment of norms for the several 
ages on the basis of the examination of many more drawings. 
The study of abilities of retarded children in the first and second 
grades, and of many more children whose intelligence quotients are 
known will throw additional light on the relation between representa- 
tion and general intelligence. Comparison of the various nationalities 
among the children of foreign parentage offers possibilities of contribu- 
tions of psychological interest in relation to racial differences. 
Several new problems also suggest themselves. A comparison of the 
abilities of kindergarten and non-kindergarten children in the primary 
grades may shed some light on the value of kindergarten training in one 
of its essential aspects. A comparison of drawings made under dif- 
ferent conditions by the same children may lead to conclusions of con- 
siderable interest and educational value. Among these, a comparison of 
drawings whose subjects were imposed by the teacher with others of 
the same or allied subjects produced spontaneously may indicate the 
extent to which free choice affects interest, effort and attainment. 
Again, a comparison of drawings of the same subject with and without 
color may suggest the strength or weakness of the color appeal. 
One of the subjects erp this study was undertaken was the 
extent to which young children“dtaw from the model. The Committee 
was diverted from this problem partly because of a conviction that a 
series of scales would be serviceable in its solution. 
The problem today is by no means solved. The emphasis which 
some psychologists have placed upon the mental image as the sole 
stimulus to expression in drawing suggests a kind of divorce between 
impression and expression which we believe may lead to most faulty 
educational practise. Hence some decisive answer to the question is 
important in its practical as well as its theoretical bearings. 
It seems self-evident, from many observations of children at work 
with various expressive media—for example, drawing, painting and 
building—that even children of the kindergarten period, in drawing, 
painting or building, are definitely influenced by the model at hand. 
Not only are they stimulated to reproduce the objects seen, but they 
frequently check up their results by reference to the objects represented, 
and occasionally turn to the models during their activity for light on 
doubtful points. 
Whether a child draws directly from his image or by observation of 
the model, certainly he has need of recent, vital experience of the model 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  98 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
both as a stimulus and as an aid to adequate representation. A com- 
parison of drawings of a number of subjects, made with and without 
the model, and evaluated by a standardized series of scales should 
throw additional light upon this question. 
LIMITATIONS OF THE SCALES 
The reliability of all measures is limited by the subjective factor in 
their application. Even measurement with so objective a standard 
as the foot rule is not infallible. Two individuals measuring the height 
of a person or the area of a room may vary from # to 6 inches in their 
results. In the use of the handwriting scales absolute agreement is 
less probable, because of the greater complexity of the qualities meas- 
ured. In judging English compositions or drawings, because of the 
still greater complexity of the qualities measured, and the wider range 
of variability among the samples to be measured, the reliability is even 
less. 
Nevertheless it is claimed for all correctly constructed product scales 
that they are a far more objective measure than the judgment of any 
teacher, because they represent the judgment of many competent 
judges. With sufficient training in their use they are found to be much 
less variable in their results than the unaided grading of a teacher, and 
therefore provide a fairer means of rating individual children. The 
scale score for a class or grade is sufficiently reliable for purposes of 
comparisons of group with group which are otherwise impossible. 
These scales in particular are limited in their application in several 
ways. First, they consist only of three subjects. This shortcoming 
is in part compensated for by the fact that these three subjects con- 
stitute the dominant interests of children in representation. Approxi- 
mately 41 per cent of those children included in this study drew human 
beings, 34 per cent drew dwelling houses, and 21 per cent trees. It 
may be assumed that the majority of children will be able to demon- 
strate their ability by the average score for these three subjects. How- 
ever it is desirable that in the future other scales be constructed, based 
upon other concepts of demonstrated interest. Among these, vehicles, 
furniture, and animals would probably be of special value. 
Since color was debarred from consideration in this study, other 
measures need to be devised for the evaluation and investigation of 
color in representation, in all its aspects.
-P-A-G-E-98
  POSSIBLE USES OF THE SCALES 99 
The fact that emphasis in the study was placed upon representation 
rather than artistic merit leaves room for further research and possibly 
for the construction of other measures based primarily upon esthetic 
values. That the two are not identical was indicated in the course of the 
investigation. One judge, interested in impreSsionistic-and cubist 
art, reversed almost completely the usual judgments on the composition 
series. One judge, an artist unfamiliar with children’s work, after 
rating five drawings, in each of two series, wrote, “The rest are all 
equally bad.” It is evident in both cases that esthetic bias made it 
impossible to judge the drawings on a representative basis. 
It is generally conceded, and borne out by the evidence, that the 
general trend of interest in young children is toward adequate repre- 
sentation before esthetic expression. The very slight degree to which 
they select design is illustrative of this fact, as well as the slow develop- 
ment of the tendency to balanced arrangement in representative draw- 
ing, which is discussed in Chapter VI. 
It seems probable also that ability to express ideas clearly and truly 
is fundamental to good art, however much maturer interpretation may 
depart from photographic accuracy of representation. Nevertheless, 
it would be interesting if other scales could be constructed in which 
other standards—of beauty of form and color, proportion or balance 
in composition, etc., would be applied. : 
In conclusion, the restriction of these scales to a specific period of 
education and to specific ages is in itself a limitation. It has already 
been suggested that this limitation was thought to be justifiable in the 
interest of a finer and more accurate measure within the prescribed 
limits. It might be compared to the construction of a millimeter 
rule to supplement the meter-centimeter rule, or the foot rule to supple- 
ment the yard stick. 
Within its own limits it makes possible truer definitions of abilities, but 
for comparison with larger wholes, reference must be made to the more 
inclusive measure. A determination of equivalences between the 
several units of the kindergarten-primary scale and those of the Thorn- 
dike, the Kline-Carey, or any other reliable and comprehensive scales 
that may be devised, is therefore desirable; or else, in cases where 
comparison with achievements for all grades of a school or school system 
is wanted, one of the more comprehensive measures should be applied. 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  CHAPTER VI 
SUBSIDIARY PROBLEMS IN TECHNIQUE 
In view of the large mass of material available for their solution 
some questions concerning children’s handling of the technique of 
drawing suggested themselves as worthy of investigation. 
Do children tend to represent objects in mass or in outline? To 
what extent do they draw the human face in full view or in profile? 
How far are definite ideas of the relative magnitudes of objects mani- 
fested? What evidence, if any, is shown of the consciousness of per- 
spective in a picture? 
As it was practically impossible to include the whole collection of 
drawings in these investigations, about half of the original material 
was examined, the selection being left wholly to chance. Later, all 
available drawings of the four and eight year children were added, and 
all the drawings of houses and of human beings that had previously 
been omitted. In all, 18,667 samples were examined. In this series 
of studies no attempt was made to segregate the work of the three 
grades, but the sex and age groupings were rigidly adhered to. 
OUTLINE AND MASS DRAWING 
The drawings were first examined to discover what proportion of the 
children had made use of outline or mass, an inquiry the answer to 
which would be of practical value to many teachers of art in the kinder- 
garten and primary grades. For our purposes, mass drawing was 
interpreted broadly to include all products in which the surface of the 
object had been filled in, regardless of whether it was circumscribed 
by a definite outline or not. Only those products were considered as 
outline drawings in which the contour of the forms alone was indicated. 
Forms in which parts were répresented by their outlines only, and other 
parts in mass (as defined above) were classed as “combination.” 
The several objects of each drawing were considered individually. 
If any drawing contained all three types it was listed under the three 
headings—outline, mass, and combination. No specimen, however, 
was tabulated more than once under each heading—so that if it con- 
100 ty
-P-A-G-E-100
  SUBSIDIARY PROBLEMS IN TECHNIQUE 101 
tained two or more objects drawn in outline, and only one in mass, this 
fact was not indicated in any way. To a certain extent this procedure 
obscures the results, but the probabilities are wholly in favor of a 
larger proportion of objects drawn with the predominating technique. 
The method used seems preferable, for its results are in terms of the 
number of children using each mode of representation. The data are 
presented in their original form—by cities—in table 24, which also 
shows the totals for girls and boys of each age and the number of draw- 
ings on which the data are based. Finally, the original figures have 
been converted into a percentile value, calculated on the basis of the 
total number of drawings examined for each city and for each age 
group. The age and sex differences are also graphically represented 
in figure 13 (page 108). 
Considering first the totals for each year, there is a striking preference 
for outline drawing among the four year children—nearly 73 per cent 
of all four year old children choosing this mode of expression. The 
percentage decreases steadily up to eight years, with the most marked 
decline at six. Mass drawing obviously shows the opposite trend, 
starting with 26.6 per cent at four years and increasing steadily to 
eight years, rising most sharply at six years. That these findings are 
the result of the maturing of natural tendencies, however, is by no means 
clear. An examination of the returns from the various cities suggests 
at least a doubt of such an interpretation. 
In the drawings from some cities outline predominates throughout 
the five year period, whereas in others mass work appears in considerable 
quantity in the fifth year. A scrutiny of the percentages of mass and 
outline drawing for each city, even disregarding those cities in which 
the later years are inadequately represented, shows a wide range of 
variations. City L, having no eight year representation, has percen- 
tages of 39.9 and 63.9 respectively for outline and mass, while CityI, 
with approximately proportionate distribution of its age groups, has 
63.6 and 41.9. The deviations are so wide that it seemed worth while 
to calculate a new group of percentile values, eliminating the six cities 
in which mass drawing was found in considerably larger amount than 
was usual £hroughout the five years—Cities E, F, J, L, R, and S. This 
series of values is given at the foot of table 24. It will be seen that 
for every year. there is an appreciable increase in the percentage of 
outline drawings—1.0, 5.5, 9.1, 9.5, and 7.1 for the five years respec- 
tively;—and a correspgnding decrease in the percentage of mass draw-

ings—1.0, 4.7, 9.1, 9.0, and 4.3. For the eight year group there are 
virtually no drawings for cities E, J, and L, so that the contrast would 
probably be considerably greater if these three cities had been adequately 
represented. 
The significant fact is that six cities, representing only 14.3 per cent 
of the cases, should have modified the general averages as markedly as 
they have. In two cities—E and Z—mass drawing nearly equaled 
outline in the four year group, but in both cases the whole technique—

Fic. 13. Comparison or SEXES AND AGES IN USE or Mass AND OUTLINE 
the use of the side of the crayon, producing forms that were ill-defined, 
hazy and lifeless—is obviously imposed and unchildlike. In no other 
cases was there any considerable amount of work in which the outline was 
entirely omitted. 
The natural inference, in consideration of all the data, is that outline 
drawing is normal with the majority (at least three-fourths) of four 
year children and that the transition to mass is, at least in part, the 
result of school instruction. The question—just how far and at what
-P-A-G-E-108
  SUBSIDIARY PROBLEMS IN TECHNIQUE 109 
period instruction should attempt to modify this method of expression— 
is one for the future to answer. 
Sex differences are indicated in the table and more clearly presented 
in figure 13. It is evident that girls, from the beginning, and through- 
out the five years, use the outline less frequently, and mass more fre- 
quently than the boys. Two plausible explanations may be suggested 
—the greater precocity of girls, assuming that mass drawing is a matter 
of maturing power; or their greater docility or amenability to instruc- 
tion, assuming that mass drawing is the result of school influence. 
FULL-FACE AND PROFILE DRAWING OF THE HUMAN FACE 
The drawings of the human figure were next examined, to determine 
how far children tended to draw the full face or profile. Four general 
types of representation were discovered: (1) the unequivocal full-face 
view; (2) the unequivocal profile; (3) the doubtful, in which the features 
are so undefined that it is impossible to determine whether the inten- 
tion was to represent the full face or profile; and (4) the mixed type, 
which combines certain characteristics of the two views; for example, 
representing the forehead, nose and chin, the general contour of the 
face, in profile; the two eyes and mouth symmetrically placed as in 
a front view. 
The data for the several cities, with the totals and the percentages 
for the several ages and for both sexes are presented in table 25. These 
percentages are based on the total number of drawings of human be- 
ings, which is shown for each city in the last column and for the general 
summary on the base line. The final summary is also represented 
graphically in figure 14 (page 114). 
There is a manifest tendency of four year old children to draw the 
full face, with a gradual increase in the number of profile drawings 
through the ninth year. With the exception of two cities, E and L, 
(K may be disregarded because of its small representation), the cities 
are fairly consistent in their percentile values, the differences being 
attributable to the differences in the age distributions of the children 
represented. 
These results are in harmony with the findings of earlier investigators 
—Ricci, Lukens, and Hall. Several explanations have been offered 
for the tendencies indicated. It has been argued that the young child 
draws the front view because he is representing his own image, which

he sees in the mirrored image—always face to face. Again it has 
been suggested that it is the full face that first arrests the attention 
and interest of every child because of its mobility, and its higher mean- 
ing. He therefore portrays what he sees most clearly and knows best, 
naively unhampered by any consciousness of the difficulty of the sub- 
ject or the grotesque character of his own results. 
Gradually, with increased observation and experience of reality, 
and developing appreciation of esthetic values, arises the consciousness

  of the technical difficulties in the portrayal of the human face, and of 
his own short-coming in attempting it. With the dawn of self-criti- 
cism comes hesitation. The first result is a decided falling off in at- 
tempts to reproduce man at all—as is evidenced in Chapter I. The 
second, it has been suggested, is the discovery that the profile is tech- 
nically less difficult, less grotesque in its results. Hence a somewhat 
deliberate choice of the profile view, which continues to grow in favor 
through the years succeeding our own period of interest. It has also 
been conjectured that the mixed type marks the transition from full

face to profile, and may be taken as an indication of the approach of 
the period of self-criticism. 
There is no definite evidence in favor of this last inference. The 
fact that the mixed type at no period comprises more than 5.1 per cent 
of the total, whereas the profile drawings for this same year, the ninth, 
comprise 32.4 per cent, argues against the view that this type is transi- 
tional in any general sense. It is probably transitional with these 
children. Like many other vagaries of children’s drawings, the mixed 
portrait appears to be the result of an individual child’s confusion 
either of images, or of purposes, or of imitative effort. He may have 
noted the profile and then added the features which he knows to be 
there, just as he frequently adds the furniture in the house to the ex- 
terior view, or the second leg of the man on horse-back, which he knows 
to be on the other side of the horse. He may have started with a 
profile in mind and then reverted to the more habitual and familiar 
view. Or, finally, he may have copied from memory the view he has 
seen in adult portraits, and, forgetting its details, supplied the missing 
elements from his habitual modes of expression. 
The profile itself may quite possibly be the result of school instruc- 
tion, as the exercises in drawing from the living model customary in 
many schools would suggest; or of wider observation both of the human 
form itself and of the technique of others, with the consequent desire 
to reproduce this new view. Certain deviations in the cities are at 
least suggestive of instruction as a large contributing factor—notably 
the high percentage of full face drawings and the correspondingly low 
percentage of profiles in City O, which is known to be a warm advocate 
of freedom and self-expression, and an arch enemy to the imposition 
of technique. 
Sex differences again appear: the percentage of full-face drawings 
is consistently greater for the girls in every year, and the percentage 
of profiles is correspondingly less. No sound explanation for this fact 
suggests itself. It is possibly the result of a more objective and im- 
personal interest on the part of boys, leading them to see, and represent 
what they see, from the less naive and intimate viewpoint. 
Featureless drawings—in which the figure was so placed as to con- 
ceal the facial features, or in which the face was represented but void 
of all its natural organs—appeared to be popular in certain cities. 
Number 582 of the scale is typical of this artifice—plainly a device to 
avoid the grotesquery of children’s portraits, but a device of dubious
-P-A-G-E-115

merit. For it might easily create the very self-distrust which it is 
meant to overcome. It might deprive the more courageous young 
artist of that sense of power which ultimately brings success; and of 
that practice which results in power. From the psychologist’s stand- 
point it suggests an unwarranted restraint upon self-expression. 
BALANCE OR SYMMETRY OF ARRANGEMENT 
The same 18,867 specimens which had been examined for the use of 
outline and mass were again studied to discover how far the children 
seemed conscious of a sense of balance or symmetry in the arrange- 
ment of their drawings. Balance for this purpose meant, not conven- 
tional design, but the placing of forms in relation to each other; for 
example, a house with a tree or a shrub at each side, an interior view 
of a window flanked by two pictures, a table with two chairs sym- 
metrically placed one on either side, the front elevation of a house 
with doors and windows nicely balanced. There is a subjective ele- 
ment in this study, since there may be considerable variation in judg- 
ment as to just what constitutes balance. There may also be a large 
element of chance in the arrangement of the drawings themselves, so 
that it is impossible to judge in all cases whether a balanced arrange- 
ment is the result of conscious intention on the part of the designer 
or of accident or of direct imitation. Nevertheless the results are at 
least suggestive. They are given in detail for the several cities and 
ages for both sexes in table 26. The final summary is shown graphically 
in figure 15 (page 118). 
It is quite clear, contrary to the opinion of a number of educators, 
that symmetry of arrangement plays but a small part in the drawings 
of these children, a little more than 3 per cent of their products, at most, 
giving evidence of its presence. Yet its presence in any degree at the 
kindergarten-primary period is of pedagogical interest. In some in- 
dividuals it was manifested to a remarkable degree. One drawing by 
a six year old girl is distinctly decorative, showing a man well drawn 
but highly conventionalized, flanked on either side by a candle-stick 
holding a candle of relatively mammoth size, yet so proportioned as 
to form a distinctly pleasing whole. 
It is also clear that the element of balance or symmetry is seldom found 
in the products of the four year old children (one-half of one per cent), 
and shows a gradual increase from year to year—0.5, 2.4, 3.5, 4.8, and 
4.6 per cent, respectively. Again there is a slight drop in the curve at

eight years, which is probably due to the mentally retarded character 
of these children. 
A comparison of the data for balance with those for symmetrical 
design of the conventional type reveals certain contrasts worthy of 
passing mention. The first is that balance occurs much more fre- 
quently than conventional design, with a total of 3.3 per cent, as against 
0.5 per cent. The second is that while balance evidences a steadily 
increasing interest from year to year, design appears most attractive

to the kindergarten group, declining from 0.6 per cent in the kinder- 
garten to 0.3 per cent in the first grade and 0.2 per cent in the second. 
It seems safe to infer that, in so far as the younger children do lead in 
design, they lead because of direct educational influence, rather than 
naturally maturing interest. 
Sex differences in the use of balance are noteworthy. In every year 
the girls exceed the boys, with increasing differences of 0.1, 0.2, 1.1, 
1.4, and 1.7 per cent, respectively. This is in accordance with the
-P-A-G-E-118

other evidence presented of the greater interest of girls in esthetic 
values. The girls produced a greater proportion of conventional de- 
signs than the boys. They also represented a greater proportion of 
landscapes and flowers—those aspects of nature which make the strong- 
est esthetic appeal. The variations in the city scores for balance are 
slight enough to be accounted for by differences of age distribution 
and other accidental factors. 
PROPORTION 
A study of the sense of proportion as revealed in the drawings was 
next undertaken. Proportion was defined as an approximately true 
representation of the relative sizes of the objects in a picture, propor- 
tion of parts in a single object being excluded partly by reason of its 
greater difficulty of judgment. 
It is a matter of common observation among teachers of young 
children that many of them ignore completely the proportions of the 
various parts of a picture. Each object is drawn for itself alone, and 
even when several are related in a narrative or descriptive “composi- 
tion,” the man frequently towers over the house, the flower by the 
garden wall overshadows the tree beside it, the tail is quite competent 
to wag the dog. 
In order to determine the extent to which these children were 
conscious of proportion in its application to drawing, the same 18,867 
specimens previously used were again examined. The question, Do 
the several objects depicted approximate the relative sizes of these 
objects in life? was asked concerning each drawing. The affirmative 
answers alone were recorded. 
The study departs from scientific accuracy in several respects. It 
was conducted on the “all or none” basis, taking no account of different 
degrees of failure or success, giving no credit in case part of the ob- 
jects were in proportion to each other, or in case the defects were rela- 
tively slight. Drawings in which only one object was represented were 
given no credit, although it is quite possible that the children producing 
them were competent to treat a composition proportionally. This 
defect however is probably not serious, since so large a proportion of 
the maturer children drew more than one object that the chances are 
that the successes and failures would have cancelled each other. There 
is also a large subjective element in a judgment of this character. 
Nevertheless, interest attaches to the results. The defects of method  
-P-A-G-E-119

120 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
are largely due to the nature of the problem. The results undoubtedly 
indicate certain growth tendencies. They are shown in table 27 and 
figure 15 (page 118). 
Among the four year old children few (2.9 per cent) show any con- 
ception of proportion. Many, in fact, give no evidence of any con- 
| sciousness of space relationships at all. Frequently their drawings 
suggest a topsy-turvy world—a medley of objects whose base line 
varies with every object. This phase is illustrated by drawing number 
923 of the composition scale, and supplementary drawing number 815. 
In such a drawing proportion of parts is not to be expected. However, 
the deficiency lingers long after the chaos of these early attempts has 
been reduced to order. Sense of proportion develops very gradually 
from the 2.9 per cent of the four year children to 26.7 per cent among 
the seven year children, with a significant drop to 20.2 per cent among 
the eight year children represented—2.9, 9.3, 18.8, 26.7, 20.2 per cent 
respectively for the several years. 
Some inquiry into the psychological causes of this late emergence 
of proportion in graphic representation seems justifiable. Certainly 
one cannot deny that children are conscious of the differences in mag- 
nitudes of objects themselves. Even a normal two year old child will 
choose the larger of two pieces of candy, and distinguish between a 
“mamma flower” and a “baby flower,” in the latter case showing a 
dual comprehension of relative sizes—first the distinction in the mag- 
nitudes of the two flowers compared, and, second, its translation into 
terms of mother and child. It seems probable that the pre-primary 
and the less mature primary children are unable to interpret the dif- 
ferences they know in terms of two dimensional space and in magni- 
tudes quite different from those of the original objects. 
It is also probable that, in the so-called cataloguing period of graphic 
art they are not interested in portraying these relationships. Atten- 
tion centers on the individual objects, which one by one take form on 
the paper. Only when the descriptive or narrative interest emerges 
does attention focus on the problem of adapting the several parts of a 
picture to each other in the effort to produce a unified whole. As was 
suggested before, the evidence shows that this development in graphic 
arts is somewhat later than it is in language. The fact that 75 per 
cent of seven year old children describe a picture in terms of narrative 
or description, while only 26 per cent, according to our data, represent 
objects in proportion offers further corroboration of this view.

Sex tendencies are not uniform. The girls lead at four and six years, 
the boys at five, seven, and eight. In their total score the boys ex- 
celled by 0.7 per cent. There is evidently a slight difference in their 
favor. 
An examination of the results for the several cities shows marked 
differences, irrespective of the differences in age distribution. Cities 
C, G, K, W, and X should be eliminated from the comparison, either 
by reason of their small representation or because not all ages are 
adequately represented. With these omitted, the range is from 9 to 30 
per cent. Obviously the factor of instruction has affected the results, 
although to a less degree than in some other phases of drawing technique. 
PERSPECTIVE 
Perspective in art has been defined as a means of showing “upon 
flat surface the dimensions and intensities of objects at varying dis- 
tances by just gradations of form, contour, color, and light. There 
are two kinds of perspective at least,” described as linear and aerial. 
“The proper use of linear perspective produces a lessening in the size 
of objects by recession, and an apparent convergence of lines toward 
a common focus, called technically ‘the point of sight’.”* Aerial per- 
spective “may be considered in effect as the atmospheric dissipation 
and final obliteration of lines, colors, lights, and shades as the objects 
which show them recede in the distance.’? 
All previous studies of children’s attitude toward perspective have 
confined themselves to linear perspective. This policy seems justified 
on several grounds. Linear perspective is a much more measurable 
quality than aerial. Itis more easily expressed by means of the crude 
materials usually employed by children—wax crayons, pencils, etc. And, 
most important consideration of all, it is somewhat less sophisticated. 
Probably most young children are totally unconscious of such fine grada- 
tions of tone and color as constitute aerial perspective and of the at- 
mospheric effects which produce them, whereas there is clear evidence 
of a slowly developing sense of linear perspective. 
A number of interesting studies of linear perspective in children’s 
drawings have been made. Clark* (1897) experimented with 408 school 
children, ranging in age from six to sixteen years, by asking them to

draw from the model an apple pierced through by a hat pin. He found 
that 98 per cent of the six year children drew the hat pin clear across 
the apple; 40 per cent of the nine year old children did the same, 40 
per cent drew the pin to the circumference of the apple, while 20 per 
cent represented it as it actually appeared. There is an abrupt drop 
in the drawings of the more primitive type at ten years. 
O’Shea*‘ (1898) set before children ranging in age from five to seven- 
teen years the problem of drawing a chair or table from the model. 
With few exceptions the results from the younger children were in two 
dimensional space, with no evidence of any consciousness of linear 
perspective. 
Kerschensteiner® (1905) in his exhaustive study of the drawings of 
Munich school children, came to the conclusion that the drawings of the 
earlier years (his investigation begins with six years) are almost wholly 
“schematic,” showing only two dimensional space, and representing 
objects by the most significant features known to be there, without 
regard to appearances or esthetic values. His definite re- search on 
perspective therefore is confined to the years from eight to fourteen. 
He assigned as school-exercises to pupils from eight to fourteen 
years of age the drawing of a chair from the object, viewed from below, 
and a landscape. On the basis of these drawings he concludes that 
perspective appears rarely in the eighth year in boys, developing slowly 
until at ten years about 50 per cent of boys have a significant sense 
of perspective, although perfect representation of spatial relations was 
seen in the work of boys in only from 2 to 4 per cent of the drawings 
before the age of fourteen. In girls he found that there was rarely any 
evidence of a consciousness of such values at any age. 
In order to determine how far the drawings collected for this investi- 
gation conformed to the conclusions of these investigators, and if pos- 
sible to throw additional light upon this phase of development, the 
same samples which had been used before were examined for evidences 
of perspective. As in all previous studies, linear perspective alone 
was considered. Aerial perspective would have been especially difficult 
to evaluate in these specimens, since atmospheric effects would have 
been exceedingly difficult to portray with the crude materials imposed. 
In fact, no definite instance of this kind of perspective can be recalled. 
Linear perspective, when found at all, was evidenced by (1) the 
convergence of parallel lines in the representation of objects receding

in the distance, as in the drawing of a road, a railroad track, or the 
horizontal lines defining the house; (2) foreshortening, as in the lessen- 
ing of the distance between the horizontal lines representing the top of 
a box; and (3) a decrease in the relative magnitudes of objects as they 
recede into the distance. 
Instances of all three were found, especially in the work of the older 
and maturer children. The data are shown in table 28, and in figure 15 
(page 118). From these it will be seen that no four year children employed 
perspective in any of its phases. The curve rises from zero at four 
years to 0.3 per cent at five, 0.7 at six, 1.4 at seven, dropping to 1.1 
at eight years. Again the immaturity of the eight year group is demon- 
strated. 
The most frequent occurrence is found in the drawing of houses, in 
which the conventional type, with gable roof and two sides showing, 
finally predominates with the maturer children. Even the New York 
City children, in spite of their familiarity with the flat-roofed city 
block, adopt this type most frequently, modifying it sometimes by 
added height and many rows of windows to adapt it to their experience. 
The evolution of the true perspective drawing of this type of house, 
however, gives very definite testimony to its purely imitative character. 
Figure 16 suggests schematically some of the typical variants in the 
abortive attempts to reproduce this form. The crudest of these were 
usually produced by the five year old children, while those numbered 
from 7 to 10 occurred frequently in the work of the six, seven and eight 
year children. Only the last two, numbers 11 and 12, were accepted 
as perspective drawing. 
Other instances of perspective were very occasionally found in the 
drawing of landscapes, especially in the diminishing size of objects 
as they recede into the distance, and in the converging lines of roads 
and fences. But their number is exceedingly small when compared 
to the total number of drawings examined. On the whole, the study 
agrees in its results with those of previous investigators, in indicating 
the late development of representation of tri-dimensional space. 
While the sex differences are numerically slight they are significant. 
In every year, after the fifth, the boys are superior to the girls, the 
amount of the difference being 0.2 per cent at five years, 0.1 at six, 
and seven, and 0.6 per cent at eight years. While these figures do not 
confirm Kerschensteiner’s conclusion that there is a total lack of any 
sense of perspective in girls, they are indicative of a constant sex dif-

ference, appearing with the earliest manifestations of this phase of 
graphic power. 
Although the deviations of the cities (excepting K, in which there is 
a preponderance of eight year children) are not large, they also are 
interesting. All of those cities which fell far below the median, with the 
exception of Cities C, W, and X, were well represented for all grades 
and ages; while City L, which has the highest score, although repre- 
sented for all grades, had virtually no drawings from eight year old 
children. Evidently the development of perspective, while dependent 
upon the maturing of native capacities, is in part the result of education. 
That such is the true view is clearly indicated by the history of per- 
spective in art. 
Geometrical perspective was known to the ancient world, but the 
application of its laws to art in the interpretation of depth and dis- 
tance is distinctly modern. It is the most sophisticated and recently 
evolved of all the technical aspects of art which we have considered. 
Introduced during the Renaissance, it was developed by the genius of 
Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, and Albrecht Diirer. It con- 
stitutes as definite a contribution to the graphic arts as does the appli- 
cation of electricity to modern mechanical invention. It is not dis- 
covered anew by each generation, but is a part of the social heritage 
which it is the business of education to preserve and transmit. It is 
not strange therefore that evidences of its development during the 
kindergarten-primary period are rare, and that, where it does appear, 
it is the result of imitation of conventional forms, or of conscious in- 
struction. 
Psychologically, perspective consists in an attempt to portray what 
the eye actually sees, rather than what it knows to be there; and this 
is quite contrary to natural tendency. The eye, like all the organs of 
sense, is primarily a means of adaptation to the world of things. Adap- 
tation to the practical situations of life has demanded that visual ex- 
periences be immediately perceived, or interpreted in terms of their 
meanings—as stimuli calling for practical responses. 
Thus, from the beginning of life, the inverted image on the retina is, 
probably by individual adjustment, interpreted as an upright world 
of objects. So complete is this adjustment that only by a severe course 
of training is it possible to realize that it is not the original mode of 
perception. In the same way, things in perspective, both linear and 
aerial, are interpreted not as they appear but as they are known to 
be. We see distant objects, not as smaller, more faintly outlined, or 
less vividly colored, but simply and directly as remote in space.
-P-A-G-E-127

Through early and constant experience, appearances, ignored as 
appearances, gradually become definite signs of meanings—of distance 
and solidity—so that many adults of today who are perfectly compe- 
tent to react correctly to the meanings are totally oblivious of the signs 
—of perspective in any of its phases. In the early drawings of the 
race it is of course the meanings that are portrayed, and not the signs. 
It is not to be expected that the little child, naively conscious of a real 
world of things, and attempting to express his somewhat vague and 
inaccurate images of that world, will adopt so sophisticated a phase 
of technique as perspective. 
EDUCATIONAL CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING TECHNIQUE 
The results of the series of studies on technique point clearly to 
some practical conclusions. Concerning the use of outline and mass 
the evidence is wholly in favor of outline as the natural method for 
the kindergarten, and probably for the primary grades. Only in ex- 
ceptional cases, which are manifestly the result of direct instruction, do 
the youngest children abandon their preference for outline, and in 
such instances the drawings are usually lacking in the vigor, individ- 
uality, and naive realism which characterize child art at its best. 
There is nothing objectionable, from the standpoint of later artistic 
development, in the employment of line. No habit of manual skill, 
or of thinking, or of esthetic appreciation that must later be unlearned 
is imposed, for the technique of painting itself frequently includes the 
sketching in of the main motif in line. Van Dyke says, 
Perhaps we would do well to consider that color has its beauty, that line has its 
beauty, and that there is no ground for comparison between them as to which is the 
more beautiful. Each has an individual beauty to be judged by its own merits, and 
both together make up a language of art without which the highest thought or feeling 
of the artist would remain unexpressed. 
Drawing is the representation of lines, or their modifications, upon flat surface in 
such a way that the curves, the depressions, the elevations, the structures, in short 
the linear character of an object, are shown to us. It includes in its scope light-and- 
shade, perspective, and values, as some of the aids whereby it attains its end. For 
drawing in art does not mean a flat silhouette thrown upon a canvas; nor does line 
mean the hard edging about an enclosed surface.® 
Obviously such an interpretation of line is beyond the scope of the 
kindergarten-primary period, for “light and shade, perspective, and

SUBSIDIARY PROBLEMS IN TECHNIQUE 129 
values” involve vision and technical skills far beyond the capacities of 
these children. The flat silhouette is the normal mode of expression 
for this period, the rudimentary art form out of which the higher forms 
may be evolved. Moreover, many of the less exalted phases of art— 
the cartoon, the poster, much of illustrative art, and mechanical draw- 
ing in all of its aspects—employ the line. 
Gradually, as their powers increase, children should be guided to- 
ward the employment of mass as well as outline, so that ultimately 
they may be enabled to use both in their appropriate places. Especially 
in the years succeeding the primary grades, they should have frequent 
opportunity to use those art media which definitely encourage expres- 
sion in mass—charcoal, pastels, and fluid color. During this early 
period these media are of doubtful value for the purpose. Kinder- 
garten and primary children tend to use them either for outline drawing 
or for playful experimentation in the flow and mixing of color. 
Young children can use water color to excellent advantage for the occasional 
experience of color effects, but they are too young for the intelligent handling of a 
medium so capricious. . . . . The results obtained by primary children in 
water color, which are admired by adults, are almost always chance effects caused by 
the fluid character of the medium and were unforeseen by the child. Experimentation 
with accidental color effects has a definite value, but this value is perhaps greater 
when the experimenter is more mature and less likely to gain the idea that careless 
ventures which may turn out well are more worth while and likely to receive greater 
recognition than purposeful effort.” 
In the drawing of the human form, as was previously suggested, all 
the evidence points toward a demand for greater encouragement in 
its representation and judicious guidance in the technique of its execu- 
tion as the need arises. During the kindergarten and first grades it 
is probable that no further stimulus need be offered than the encourage- 
ment of the natural interest in human portraiture, by attention to 
sincere effort and praise of its results. 
While the actual selection of subjects for drawing shows a steady 
decrease in the choice of human beings from year to year and from 
grade to grade, this is quite probably due to other causes than decreas- 
ing interest in the subject. Among these is the greater propensity of 
primary teachers, possibly actuated by authorities higher up, to im- 
pose the subject matter and often even the method of representation. 
7 Sargent, Fine and Industrial Arts in Elementary Schools, p. 60. 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  130 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
When such imposition occurs, it frequently avoids the dangers and diffi- 
culties of the human form in favor of subjects technically easier of exe- 
cution—especially landscapes, simpler animals, flowers, and other 
natural objects. 
A second potent factor is probably the growing consciousness in the 
children themselves of the technical difficulties involved and the crudi- 
ties of their own attempts to overcome them. While it may not be 
possible for every child to achieve a high degree of merit in this phase 
of art, recent educational experience has shown that a remarkable 
degree of power in human portraiture can be attained by just normal 
children through encouragement and right guidance of their own crea- 
tive efforts. As evidence may be cited the excellent results of the 
classes conducted under the direction of Prof. Franz Cizek for children 
from six to fourteen years of age in Vienna. 
The child of seven, usually in the second grade, who is becoming 
increasingly conscious of failures and defects in his own workmanship, 
needs to be made familiar with such rudiments of technique as will 
stem the rising tide of his own discouragement. At this time and not 
earlier the “‘stick man’”—a popular device in many schools—may be 
justifiable as a means to secure action and life. Here also the sugges- 
tion of profile drawing may be given, for its novelty and consequent 
stimulus to new effort; and the deliberate and conscious reference to 
the model may be profitably introduced. The studied omission of 
the facial features on the other hand seems to beg the question at issue; 
to admit the difficulties without offering ways and means to overcome 
them. 
Proportion of the elements of a picture is evidently closely allied 
with the tendency to represent a unified whole, although the two are 
not always synchronous in their development. Numbers of clearly 
conceived compositions appear in which proportion of parts is gro- 
tesquely lacking. 
\During the kindergarten period, when interest centers chiefly in 
picturing’ individual objects, with little interest in their relationships, 
proportion is not to be emphasized. In the seventh year, the normal 
age for first grade, at least 19 per cent of the children have arrived at a 
fair sense of proportion. It is quite probable that this figure is too 
low, since a considerable number of the children presented drawings 
of single objects, in which proportion could not be judged. At this 
age some definite guidance toward proper proportion is probably justi-

fied. That calling attention to the relative sizes of real objects is not 
sufficient is proven by the fact that six year old children are conscious 
of the differences in real objects. The emphasis must be placed upon 
the relative sizes of pictured objects, as corresponding to reality. 
Reference may be made to the size of objects in good illustrations. 
Tactful allusion may be made to the discrepancies noted in children’s 
drawings. Occasional definite exercises in drawing objects in propor- 
tion to one another—a flower beside a house, a boy entering a door, 
a bird in a tree—may be helpful. Such instruction must be sympa- 
thetic, incidental, constructive, It must help children to correct 
individual defects of which they“themselves are becoming vaguely con- 
scious, while avoiding the arousal of that self-distrust which is the 
death-knell of spontaneous self-expression. 
The sense of balance or symmetrical arrangement, like the drawing 
of conventional design, has small place in the art of the kindergarten- 
primary period. It is evident that the normal trend of interest during 
these years is toward the representation of ideas, that in most cases 
attention is wholly concentrated upon the problem of adequate ex- 
pression, and that few children are consciously concerned with the 
esthetic values of balanced arrangement. 
That this is not due to an absence of esthetic appreciation psychol- 
ogists and teachers will agree. } The Stanford Revision of the Binet- 
Simon Tests places the test for rudimentary esthetic appreciation at 
five years, [Chis is definite evidence that three-fourths of the five year 
children on whose responses the test is based reacted favorably. The 
delight of younger children in flowers and other beautiful natural objects 
is matter of common observation. That satisfactions in colorful and in 
orderly design appear as early as the kindergarten period is frequently 
attested. 
In all probability, in this case, as in many others, observation and 
appreciation antedate the desire to create. The tendency to produce 
either design or balanced arrangement seems to be of later develop- 
ment. Its premature emphasis is probably not fruitful. There is 
serious danger of creating a wrong mental set which may prejudice 
this type of expression when the right moment comes. “The later 
years of a child’s life have their own rights, and a superficial, merely 
emotional anticipation is likely to do the child serious injury.’* 
8 Dewey, The School and the Child, p. 56. 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  132 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
Concerning perspective, there is universal agreement that it is wholly 
foreign to the needs and interests of the kindergarten-primary group. 
The evidence of this investigation is almost entirely in harmony with 
this view. 
In general, the examination of technical abilities indicates that they 
are the product of the natural maturing of capacities, aided and sup- 
plemented by direct instruction. Technique can be taught. The 
wide differences in the ratings of the various cities in their use of every 
phase considered—mass, profile, balance, perspective, and proportion 
—are definite evidence of this truth. The general agreement in the 
several phases gives testimony to the systematic training given in 
some cities along all these lines, and to its total absence in others. On 
the other hand, agreement in the general trend of development (the 
fact that these differences are rarely very great) is clear proof that the 
factor of natural maturing of capacities and interests is also potent. 
Some development of technical ability doubtless takes place in spite 
of the lack of technical instruction, but instruction cannot anticipate 
or force the development of natural capacity. |The order and timing 
of instruction in drawing, as in every other aspect of education, in order 
to be effective, must coincide with the course of normal development of 
powers. This is the only means by which educational waste may be 
avoided, and results made commensurate with effort.) 
Finally the evidence emphasizes, in technique as in content and general 
excellence, a wide range of individual differences. Among four year 
old children there is some employment of mass, profile, balance, and 
proportion—of all the phases of technique studied except perspective. 
Among seven and eight year children on the other hand there are num- 
bers of individuals who show no consciousness of technique in any of 
these aspects. While these differences may be due in part to environ- 
mental causes—either in home or school—they are also without doubt 
the result of differences in capacity and interest. Such variations 
again point to the need of individual instruction and guidance, that 
these children, whether markedly above or below the general average, 
may be stimulated to progress from their present level of achievement 
» toward what they ought to achieve—that they may not be retarded 
by the school’s effort to maintain the dead level of class instruction 
and attainment, or discouraged and confused by demands beyond their 
capacity to fulfill.

  CHAPTER VII 
GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
The investigation has now covered the ground which it surveyed in 
its initial program. A brief summary of the results may be of value 
in bringing into relation the several studies, with their inferences and 
deductions. 
Some conclusions of general psychological interest may be drawn 
with considerable confidence. Concerning the content, the subjects 
drawn, it is evident that children from four to eight years of age draw 
the human figure more frequently than any other one form, and the 
adult more frequently than the child; that dwelling houses are second 
in order of preference; trees, furniture, and vehicles following in this 
order. Other classes of subjects occur in small percentages. Interest 
in design and geometrical form is not characteristic of these years. 
In the evolution of drawing technique four fairly well defined stages 
have been recognized: 
1. During the scribble stage children make purposeless and meaning- 
less marks, for the mere satisfaction in manipulating the pencil, and 
seeing something happen as a result. 
2. Soon definite meanings are assigned to these scribblings. They 
become houses, or persons, or animals, according to the child’s desire, 
and assume a place in his imaginative world. Cases are known in 
which children were able to identify these drawings and name them 
correctly several months after they had been made, although to the 
adult observer they bore no resemblance to the objects represented. 
This stage is illustrated in the drawings of the scales by the samples 
of zero value in human beings and houses. It may be called the sym- 
bolic stage, and usually reaches its culmination at four years. 
3. When the drawings begin to take on some, definite characteristics 
of the objects for which they stand, the schematic stage is reached. 
While they may attain considerable accuracy and fullness of detail, 
schematic drawings are characterized by absence of true perspective, of 
notan (light and shade), of depth and solidity, and texture. They have 
been described as picture writing, in which the purpose is the expression 
133 
   
-P-A-G-E-133
134 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
of ideas, regardless of esthetic values. They represent what is known 
to be rather than what the eye actually sees. 
4, Finally evolves the stage of true representative art, which seeks 
to interpret the appearances of things, the feeling of life, of truth and 
beauty, through the use of linear perspective, the subtler values of 
light and shade, atmosphere, and composition. The transition is usually 
marked by an awakened sense of self-criticism which should lead to 
definite interest in technique whose mastery becomes the means of set- 
ting free the power of adequate self-expression. 
No sharp line may be drawn between any two successive stages. 
Many drawings will be found which it would be difficult to classify as 
conforming to any one type—border-line cases, which will be partly 
symbolic and partly schematic, or partly schematic and partly repre- 
sentative. 
It is evident that the kindergarten-primary period on the whole 
coincides with the period of schematic drawing. The scribble stage is 
in the last stages of transition at four years, and is rarely found in the 
later years. The stage of symbolism merges rapidly into the schematic. 
The schematic characteristics—the flat silhouette, unrelieved by shad- 
ing, or the bare outline, suggesting only two dimensions—predominate 
throughout the period. True representative art appears rarely during 
these years, although there are evidences of the earlier stages of transi- 
tion in some of the drawings. 
While outline may, under guidance, give way to mass, it does not 
lose its two-dimensional, silhouette character. While some crude ef- 
forts at perspective appear, they usually give proof of their imitative, 
and uncritical origin by their conventional and faulty character. 
Within the limits of the schematic type however, there are numerous 
changes from year to year. In subject matter, it is probable that the 
youngest children, because they are least concerned about making 
their drawings conform to reality, are most courageous. Three of the 
drawings of God are by four year old children, and the fourth is by a 
five year child. Their courage seems to be limited only by their mental 
horizon. 
In the direction of interest, maturity changes are seen chiefly in 
the gradual decrease in the percentage of human beings and the increase 
in drawings of forms from nature; in the decline of interest in toys at 
six years; and the gradual transition from the representation of isolated 
or unrelated objects to “composition,” or the representation of a unified 
whole—from the cataloguing to the narrative or descriptive stage. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 135 
In technical ability there is definite progress from year to year. This 
is shown first in the results of measurements by the scales. Although 
there is a large amount of overlapping in the scores for the successive 
years, there is a steady rise in the median and the general contour of 
the curve from year to year and from grade to grade. The studies 
in technique attest the same fact. The drawings show fairly steady 
increase in the employment of mass, in recognition of proportion in the 
relative magnitudes of objects in a single picture, and in the use of 
balance and perspective. The older children have also begun to em- 
ploy the profile view in their drawings of the human form. 
The child is becoming more and more conscious of the real character 
of the objects he attempts to draw. As his experience widens and 
deepens, as his observation quickens to things as they are—in their 
multitudinous variety and complexity—he responds with ever growing 
accuracy and detail in his graphic representations. 
While the period of self-distrust and self-criticism reaches its cul- 
mination in the years immediately succeeding the kindergarten-primary 
period, it has its beginnings here in many instances. This may be 
seen in the attempts at perspective, however inadequate these may be. 
It is perhaps indicated by the decreasing tendency to undertake the 
representation of the human form; perhaps also in the transition to 
the profile type; and in all the tentative experiments with new ways 
of attacking old problems. 
In this study, age differences usually reach their culmination in 
the eighth year. In the ninth, there is definite retrogression in balance, 
proportion, and perspective. In general merit, as measured by the 
scales, there is a drop at eight years, six months in both human beings 
and houses. It seems quite probable that these deviations from the 
general trend occur because the children represented form a selected 
group of.mentally retarded development. 
Sex differences are not great in amount, but constant in some respects. 
In their selection of content, boys exceed the girls considerably in 
representing mechanical objects—tools, vehicles, and machinery—and 
slightly in representing adults, animals, and flags; while girls exceed 
boys considerably in representing furniture and articles of domestic 
use, and slightly in representing children, plants, and nature forms 
in general, and in design. By inference it might be said that while the 
interests of boys tend toward the practical, the mechanical, and the 
larger social aspects of life, the interests of girls tend toward the esthetic,
-P-A-G-E-135
  136 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
the domestic, and the personal. However these inferences must be 
qualified by the fact that the differences are slight as compared with 
the resemblances; and by the probability that environmental forces 
have been potent factors in producing or intensifying such differences 
as do occur. 
In technical skill, as measured by the scales, there is no appreciable 
difference in the scores for the two sexes. Boys excelled slightly in 
the median score for compositions, girls for human beings and houses. 
These differences, while slight, are fairly constant for the three grades 
and for the five years, except in compositions, in which the superiority 
of the boys does not appear until the six-year-six-months group. 
In the definite studies of technique there are differences which, though 
small in degree, are constant enough to be attributable to sex charac- 
teristics. Boys at every age draw a greater proportion of objects in 
outline than the girls. In proportion, boys are superior except at four 
and six years, when the girls slightly excel. In balance the girls lead 
without exception; in perspective the boys. In the use of profile the 
the boys are markedly in advance. In general it seems that boys are 
slightly superior in the mathematical aspects of drawing, while girls 
are about equally superior in the esthetic aspects. Again it must be 
emphasized that the sex differences are never so great as are the dif- 
ferences among the individuals of either sex. fs 
Variations in the scores for the cities were of interest, not merely in 
determining the relative merits of the several cities, but in evaluating 
the place of instruction in the development of drawing ability. The 
cities varied considerably in the content of the drawings not only in 
the kind of subjects represented, the direction of interest, which was to 
be expected, but also in the range of ideas expressed, the imaginative 
content, the freedom and scope of representation.” While the kinder- 
garten children in one city drew hundreds of different ideas, the second 
grade children of another city were content to outline a square and call

Variations equally great appeared in the merit of the drawings as 
rated by the scales. They found a close parallel in the differences in 
the several aspects of technique, the use of mass, profile, proportion, 
and perspective. Since these variations are all closely correlated, the 
city showing the maturer technique and the higher rating by the scales 
being usually superior in the character and variety of ideas expressed, 
certain educational inferences suggested themselves with compelling 
force.

  GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 137 
Deficiency may be due chiefly to two opposing causes—the total 
neglect of drawing along with other forms of self-expression and of 
content, owing to over-emphasis on the formal aspects of school work; 
or neglect of the teaching of drawing, due to over-emphasis on children’s 
freedom and individual initiative. Extremes meet in their results. 
No defense of drawing is necessary. Its value—as a means of self- 
expression, of motivated observation, of defining and clarifying mental 
images, and of arousing appreciations of nature and art—is universally 
acknowledged. Its place in the kindergarten-primary curriculum is 
particularly vital, because of the dawning interest in drawing itself 
and the special need of cultivating just those values for which it stands. 
Drawing has been compared to language, a language peculiarly 
adapted to the expression of visual images. Carrying the analogy 
further, we may say that no language develops in a vacuum. Its first / 
requisite is social exposure to the language of others; the second is a 
fund of ideas to express; the third is again a social situation stimulating 
to expression. Certainly these same conditions are fundamental to 
drawing. 
\ Watching others draw, and seeing the products of others’ drawing 
is probably just as essential to drawing as hearing speech is to oral 
language. On the other hand, slavish imitation of a model is stulti- 
fying and harmful, especially in the initial stages of education. The 
little child soon loses his splendid courage, and comes to depend upon 
the initiative of others. Moreover, if the model to be imitated is 
sufficiently crude and “schematic” for successful reproduction, it fre- 
quently fails to associate itself with his previous experiences, and is 
copied as dead form, devoid of meaning or of content. If it is too 
good, it leads to discouragement and lack of effort. 
Especially baneful is the tracing of outlines in its effects upon spon- 
taneous drawing. In no case does this practise seem justifiable except 
where conventional forms are used in applied art; as in preparing a 
doilie or a Christmas bell for cutting, or repeating a unit in design. 
Imitation may be helpful if the model is presented as a suggestion, 
to be accepted or rejected, to be modified and adapted to the views 
of the young artist. It is more stimulating if several models are pre- 
sented instead of one, so that there is need and opportunity for com- 
parison and selection. Usually it is most helpful when the models 
selected are the products of the children themselves, since they repre- 
sent attainable standards, and comprehensible interpretations of their
-P-A-G-E-137
  138 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
own experiences. But these must obviously be supplemented by work 
of a higher standard—either by the teacher or by children’s artists 
whose work is simple and sincere. The life model—the object itselfi— 
has definite value at every age, both as stimulus and point of final 
reference. 
Something to express—a wide range of interesting experiences—is 
equally important. First hand contact with real things is the prime 
requisite—a truism which is older than Comenius, but which needs to 
be reémphasized in each generation of educators; a truth which today, 
in the very stress which is laid upon children’s interest and initiative, 
may be forgotten or overlooked. Literature, oral language, toys and 
pictures are valuable as supplements, but can never with safety be substi- 
tuted for the things themselves—things in the widest sense, including 
the whole available range of nature and human relationships which 
may be made meaningful to the child. 
Situations stimulating to expression in drawing—motivation through 
occasional suggestion to draw, and even what to draw, with worth 
while purposes held up to view; satisfactions for work well done, and 
judicious criticism at the right moment—are also surely in harmony 
with the new pedagogy. 
If drawing is a form of language, technique may be called its grammar. 
Grammatical rules and definitions have been banished from the primary 
curriculum. Even correct usage has been subordinated to freedom 
and spontaneity of expression. So in drawing, the first essential is 
that children form the habit of thinking and expressing their thoughts 
through the medium of the graphic arts; the will to express, and the 
sense of power. Only when confidence and courage are well established 
can attention be diverted to the forms of expression; and then only 
momentarily, for the purpose of making expression more adequate, 
and more satisfying. 
Guidance becomes dangerous if it is imposed at the cost of diminished 
spontaneity and initiative. If offered at the right moment it becomes 
a stimulus to renewed effort and achievement. So to pilot the educa- 
tional craft as to avoid the Scylla of a spontaneity barren of results in 
growing power of expression, and the Charybdis of the suppression 
of self-confidence and initiative through arbitrary and premature im- 
position of adult standards—this is a test of artistry in teaching. 
Drawing can be taught, but the limits of achievement are fixed for 
each individual by his own capacities. This truth was demonstrated 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 139 
in every phase of the present investigation. No class, no city, no grade, 
no age showed a uniform level of ability. In each case, the rating by 
the scales indicated a distribution approximating the “normal curve,” 
with many individuals grouped about the median or average, and a 
few varying more or less widely above and below the median. No 
matter how homogeneous the group, such deviations are bound to 
occur in any trait that may be measured. 
In drawing ability these differences are probably due to several 
factors. The first of these is “general intelligence.” The study of 
correlations showed that there is some connection between achievement 
in drawing and mental maturity. Especially, the children of the 
feeble-minded group were incapable of expression in drawing, and very 
few children of low intelligence excelled in drawing. A much greater 
number of the superior-intelligence group were poor in graphic art. 
It seems clear that drawing and mental ability are distinct from one 
another, and yet that there are elements of mental ability which are 
indispensable to drawing. 
A fair range and grasp of images and ideas, sufficient mental alert- 
ness to insure visual exploration and perception, open-mindedness or 
susceptibility to instruction, power of attention sufficiently developed 
to permit concentration on the purpose in hand, and of sufficient dura- 
tion to carry out the initial purpose, some permanence of memories— 
all these seem essential to even mediocre expression in art. 
Equally essential are other traits not necessarily associated with 
general intelligence in a high degree. Among these may be mentioned 
the predominance of visual images, interest in graphic representation, 
and manual skill. When these two groups of traits are united in one 
individual, real excellence in drawing results. Individuals of high 
intelligence, lacking interest in graphic representation and manual 
skill, may be quite deficient in drawing. On the other hand, individuals 
lacking the essential mental traits will be unable to draw, although 
they may become fairly proficient in some purely mechanical skills. 
Between the extremes all degrees of ability may occur. 
Courtis has defined education as “taking the child from where he is 
to where he ought to be.” The definition emphasizes the individual 
child as the focus of educational effort—the point from which all educa- 
tion must start, the goal toward which all effort must be directed. 
Such a definition may fittingly be applied to drawing, in the light of 
present knowledge. Drawing is taking a child from where he is in
-P-A-G-E-139
  140 CHILDREN’S DRAWINGS 
attainment to where He ought to be. The supervisor or the teacher 
may set up ultimate goals, but the capacities of individual children 
condition their attainment. Only by adapting instruction to their 
needs can real success be achieved. 
Concerning the scales it must be said that they are not offered as 
the last word on the subject. Other scales representative of children’s 
drawing in other subjects—for example, animals and vehicles—and 
other aspects—for example, esthetic and color values, should be con- 
structed. 
Concerning the use of the scales, it must be emphasized that they 
should never become models, as the handwriting scales have legitimately 
been used, for instruction. Nothing could be farther from their inten- 
tion. It is hoped that they will be of service both to individual teachers 
and to administrators in the kindergarten-primary field, in the measure- 
ment of results, but methods must always be determined not by results 
but by sincere application of sound principles. 
Further use of the scales may be made in the measurement of dif- 
ferences between kindergarten and non-kindergarten children, and 
perhaps, in finding a decisive answer to the question frequently pro- 
pounded but never satisfactorily answered: Do children of the kinder- 
garten-primary period draw from the model, or exclusively from their 
own mental images? Other uses will doubtless appear in the future. 
Finally it must be stressed that, despite the frequent allusion to 
scales as “measuring rods,” analogous to the foot rule or the thermome- 
ter, experience with other product scales has proven that there is a 
far larger element of subjectivity in their use. Hence definite train- 
ing and practise are necessary before any individual can employ them 
with a high degree of accuracy; and, at best, there will always be varia- 
tions in individual ratings. It can only be said that the amount of 
variation in teachers’ judgments should be considerably less with the 
scales than without them, and that their employment offers opportuni- 
ties for comparative studies otherwise impossible.

PREFACE 
Tue volume now offered to the public is the result of lifelong 
labors in the field of grammatical study. A profound conviction 
of the value of the classical languages in a course of liberal edu- 
cation and an earnest desire to aid the student in mastering the 
intricacies of the Latin tongue with as much ease and rapidity as 
is consistent with true scholarship have led to the preparation of 
the present work. The instruments of education must of course 
be readjusted from time to time to the ever-changing methods in 
school and college. Accordingly the prime object of this volume 
is to adapt the work of instruction to present methods and present 
needs. In view of the heavy demands now made on the time of 
classical teachers and students a special effort has been made to 
develop the practical-side of grammar, to make it as helpful as 
possible to the teacher in the difficult task of explaining the force 
of involved constructions in Latin authors, and as helpful as pos- 
sible to the learner in his early efforts to understand and appre- 
ciate thought in the strange garb of a complicated Latin sentence. 
Simplicity and clearness, ever of paramount importance in the 
work of the class-room, have received special attention. 
Designed at once as a text-book for the class-room and a book 
of reference in study, this volume aims not only to present a sys- 
tematic arrangement of the leading facts and laws of the Latin 
language for the benefit of the beginner, but also to make ade- 
quate provision for the needs of the advanced student. By 
brevity and conciseness in the choice of phraseology, and com- 
pactness in the arrangement of forms and topics, I have endeay- 
ored to compress within the limits of a convenient manual an 
amount of carefully selected grammatical facts which would 
otherwise fill a much larger volume. 
Syntax has received special attention. An attempt has been 
il
-P-A-G-E-4
iv PREFACE 
made to exhibit as clearly as possible that remarkable system of 
laws which the genius of the Latin language has created for itself. 
Accordingly the leading principles of construction have been put 
in the form of definite rules or laws, and fully illustrated by 
carefully selected examples from Latin authors, a mode of treat- 
ment perfectly consistent with scientific accuracy, and sanctioned 
by the general experience of teachers as in the highest degree 
helpful to the pupil. Moreover, to secure convenience of reference 
and to give completeness and vividness to the general outline, 
these laws of the language after having been separately discussed 
are presented in a body at the close of the syntax. 
A special effort has been made to simplify and explain the 
difficult and intricate subject of the subjunctive. The ordinary 
constructions of that mood in simple sentences and in independent 
clauses are first stated and illustrated with great fulness to give 
the pupil a clear idea of its distinctive nature and use, and thus 
to prepare him to understand the process by which the mood 
passes from these simple independent uses to the more difficult 
dependent constructions. Too often the pupil sees no connection 
between an independent and a dependent subjunctive; what he 
has learned in regard to the former is no help to an acquaintance 
with the latter, but with the method here adopted it is hoped 
that after having mastered the ordinary independent uses of the 
mood he will be able to recognize even in the most involved con- 
structions in subordinate clauses only new illustrations of prin- 
ciples with which he is already familiar. To him the subjunctive 
in a subordinate clause will be no longer a dreaded stranger, but 
an acquaintance and friend. 
The subject of Hidden Quantity has received due attention in 
this volume as in the author’s earlier Latin Grammar. Indeed, 
that work is believed to be entitled to the honor of having been 
the first Latin Grammar that ever attempted to mark systemati- 
cally the hidden quantity of vowels, and to point out the means 
for determining it. 
Another consideration which has had weight in determining 
the character of this grammar is the importance of bringing the 
treatment which the practical needs of the school and college
-P-A-G-E-5
PREFACE Vv 
seem to demand into harmony with the learned results recently 
gathered by specialists in the field of historical grammar and 
linguistic study. On this point I deem myself fortunate in hav- 
ing secured the cordial coéperation of three of the eminent Lat- 
inists who are engaged in the preparation of the “Historische 
Grammatik der Lateinischen Sprache” now in process of publica- 
tion at Leipzig, Professor I’, Stolz of the University of Innsbruck, 
Professor G. Landgraf of Munich, and Professor H. Blase of 
Giessen, authors whose works are known and read by classical 
scholars throughout the world, and whose names are identified 
with the best scholarship of the age. 
In accordance with a previous arrangement the manuscript on 
Phonology, Morphology, and Etymology, when nearly ready for 
the press, was submitted to Professor Stolz with the distinct un- 
derstanding that if any part of the work was not found to be in 
full accord with the latest and best views within the range of his 
own special studies he should point it out, and suggest the best 
method of bringing the practical and the scientific views into 
harmony. By a similar arrangement the manuscript on Agree- 
ment and on the Use of Cases was submitted to Professor Land- 
graf, and that on Moods and Tenses to Professor Blase. After 
a careful examination of the several subjects submitted to their 
consideration they made written reports with such suggestions 
as their special studies warranted, and subsequently in a series of 
personal interviews I had the rare opportunity of obtaining their 
views and their advice on the various doubtful questions con- 
nected with our subject. I desire, therefore, to express my grate- 
ful appreciation of their kindness in thus freely offering me the 
priceless results of life-long labors in their several spheres. 
I am happy to acknowledge my indebtedness to my colleagues 
in the University, Professors A. G. Harkness and W. C. Poland, 
who have read the proof, and given me the benefit of their accu- 
rate scholarship and large professional experience; to Professor 
E. P. Morris of Yale University for important statistics in regard 
to Interrogative Sentences, Quod Clauses, and the Use of the 
Subjunctive in Plautus and Terence; to Dr. H. W. Hayley for 
aid in the revision of the Prosody; to Dr. G. A. Williams of the

University Grammar School for the preparation of the indices, 
and to Dr. H. F. Linscott of the University of North Carolina for 
valuable suggestions on Phonology and Etymology. 
My thanks are also due to many other friends who have kindly 
favored me with their advice, especially to Dr. C. B. Goff of the 
University Grammar School, Dr. W. T. Peck of the Providence 
High School, Dr. Moses Merrill of the Boston Latin School, and 
Dr. John Tetlow of the Girls’ High and Latin Schools, Boston. 
For the benefit of those who prefer to begin with a more ele- 
mentary manual in the study of Latin a school edition of this 
Grammar is published simultaneously with it. This is intended 
to meet the wants of those who do not contemplate a collegiate 
course of study; for all others the complete work will be found 
far more helpful. 
In conclusion I desire once more to make my grateful acknowl- 
edgments to the classical teachers of the country who by their 
fidelity and skill in the use of my books have won for them such 
marked success. To their hands this work is now respectfully 
and gratefully committed.

LATIN GRAMMAR 
INTRODUCTION 
1. Tue Latin language derives its name from the Latini, the 
Latins, the ancient inhabitants of Latium in Italy. It belongs to 
the Indo-European family, which embraces eight groups of tongues, 
known as the Aryan, the Armenian, the Greek, the Albanian, the 
Italian, the Keltic, the Germanic, and the Balto-Slavic. All these 
languages have one common system of inflection, and in various 
respects strikingly resemble each other. They are the descendants 
of one common speech spoken by a single race of men untold cen- 
turies before the dawn of history. 
2. The Latin, the Oscan, and the Umbrian are the three leading 
members of the Italian group of this family, and the resemblance 
between them is so great that they appear to be only different 
dialects of one common language. At the dawn of history the 
Latin was confined to the small district of Latium, while the Oscan 
was spoken in the southern part of Italy, and the Umbrian in the 
northeastern part; but at the beginning of the Christian era, the 
Latin had not only supplanted the Osean and the Umbrian in 
Italy, but it had already become the established language of a 
large part of Southern Europe. The Osean and Umbrian dialects 
have been preserved to us only in very scanty remains, but the 
Latin is enshrined in a rich and valuable literature extending 
over a period of several centuries. 
3. From the Latin has been directly derived the entire group 
of the Romance languages, of which the Italian, French, Spanish, 
and Portuguese are important members. The English belongs to 
HARK. LAT. GRAM,—2 +

  2 PHONOLOGY 
the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family, but it is in- 
debted to the Latin for one third of its vocabulary. Hence the 
importance of a thorough knowledge of the Latin, if we would 
understand and appreciate our own vernacular. 
LATIN GRAMMAR 
4. Latin grammar treats of the principles of the Latin language. 
It comprises five parts: 
I. Phonology, which treats of the letters and sounds of the 
language. 
II. Morphology, which treats of the form and inflection of 
words. 
III. Etymology, which treats of the derivation of words. 
IY. Syntax, which treats of the structure of sentences. 
V. Prosody, which treats of quantity and versification. 
PART I.— PHONOLOGY 
ALPHABET 
5. The Latin alphabet! is the same as the English with the 
omission of j and w, but k is seldom used, and y and z occur only , 
in words of Greek origin. 
1. It originally consisted of only twenty-one letters, as e supplied the 
place of c and g; iofiand j; u of u and v and sometimes of y. 
2. Subsequently G, formed from C by simply changing the lower part of 
the letter, was added to the Latin alphabet, and at about the same time z 
disappeared from it. Thus the alphabet continued to consist of twenty-one 
letters until the time of Augustus, when y was introduced into it from the 
Greek and z was restored from the same source. 
8. Even in the classical period C was retained in abbreviations of proper 
names beginning with G. Thus C. stands for Gaius, and Cn. for Gnaeus. 
This is a survival from the origi 
  1The Romans derived their alphabet from the Greek colony at Ciimae. 
Throughout the classical period they used in general only capital letters.
-P-A-G-E-19
  
CLASSIFICATION OF LETTERS 3 
4, U and V, originally designated by the same character, are now used 
in many of the best editions, the former as a vowel, the latter as a consonant, 
as in English. 
6. Letters are divided according to the position of the vocal 
organs at the time of utterance into two general classes, vowels 
and consonants,' and these classes are again divided into various 
subdivisions, as seen in the following: 
7. CHONAME CLASSIFICATION OF LETTERS

Norr. —x = es, or gs, is a double consonant. 
  
1If the vocal organs are sufiiciently open to allow an uninterrupted flow of 
vocal sound, a vowel is produced, otherwise a consonant; but the least open 
vowels are scarcely distinguishable from the most open consonants. ‘Thus i, 
sounded fully according to the ancient pronunciation as 6, 
  a vowel; but com- 
bined with a vowel in the same syllable, it becomes a consonant with the sound 
of y; see 12, 2. 
2 The vocal organs are fully open in pronouncing the open 4, as in father, less 
so in pronouncing the close vowels and the semivowels, and very nearly closed in 
pronouncing the mutes. 
3B is a medial vowel between the open @ and the close i, 0 a medial vowel 
between the open @ and the close u; iis a palatal vowel, Ua labial. The vowel 
scale, here presented in the form of a triangle, may be represented as a line, with 
a in the middle, with i at the palatal extreme, and with u at the labial extreme: 
i e a ° u 
4 Sonant or voiced; surd or not voiced, but simply breathed. “ 
5 With the sound of n in concord, linger. Tt occurs before gutturals; con- 
gressus, meeting,
-P-A-G-E-20
PHONOLOGY 
  8. Observe that the consonants are divided, 
1. According to the organs chiefly employed in their produe- 
tion into Gutturals, — throat letters. 
Palatals, — palate letters. 
Linguals, — tongue letters. 
Dentals, — teeth letters. 
Labials, — lip letters. 
2. According to the manner in which they are uttered, into 
Sonants, or voiced letters. 
Surds, voiceless or breathed letters.1 
9. Diphthongs are formed by the union of two vowels in one 
syllable. The most common diphthongs are ae, oe, au, and eu. 
Hi and ui are rare. 
ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN? 
10. The vowels are pronounced substantially as follows *: 
Long Short : 
@ like ain ah: al-rat a like initial a in aha5: at 
S-*' -o ““stney.= de® Cas e “net: et 
Tt * i) pique? vi dace i “pick: id 
6 * ohole: 6s Oust ) “ forty: ob 
a“ urule: i/-si Unc Uy i foils, at 
1. A short vowel in a long syllable is pronounced short: sunt, u as in 
sum, su/-mus; see 14 and 15. 
  
1 The distinction between a sonant and a surd will be appreciated by observing 
the difference between the sonant b and its corresponding surd p in such words 
as bad, pad. B is vocalized, p is not. 
2This method is now generally adopted in the schools and colleges of our 
country. By the English method, which formerly prevailed, the letters are pro- 
nounced in general as in English. 
8 But the vowel sounds must be kept as pure as possible, free from the glide or 
vanish heard in English. 
4 Latin vowels marked with the macron ™ are long in quantity, i.e. in the dura- 
tion of the sound; those not marked are short in quantity; see 15,4. Observe 
that the accent is also marked. For the laws of accentuation, see 16 and 17. 
5 The short vowels occupy only half as much time in utterance as the long 
vowels, but they can be only imperfectly represented by English equivalents. 
They have, however, nearly the same sound as the corresponding long vowels, 
but, with the exception of a, they are somewhat more open. 
8 Or 6 like @ in made ; ilike e in me, and @ like 00 in moon.
-P-A-G-E-21
  
ROMAN PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN 5 
2. Y, found only in Greek words, is intermediate in sound between the 
Latin i and u, similar to the French u and the German ti: Ny/-sa. 
8. U in qu,! and generally in gu and su before a vowel, has the sound of 
w: qui (kwe); lin’-gua (lin-gwa); sua/-sit (swa-sit). 
11. Diphthongs.—In diphthongs, each vowel retains its own 
sound ; ae nearly like ai in aisle: aes, mén/-sae? 
oe. 4 ee Ole coin foe’-dus 
au. 6 “one <4 out? aut, au/-rum 
eu ce eu +" fends neu, neu’-ter? 
el “ ei veil: ei, hei 
cee oe. cui (kwe) 
12. Consonants. — Most of the consonants are pronounced nearly 
as in English, but the following require special notice: 
  ce like ¢ income: co/-ma, cé/-na 
ch ae ch ‘ chemist: cho/-rus 
g se gis get's: ge/-nus, gl6/-ria 
i we Jo eS yets iam (yam), itis (yoos) 
z rs r <} yumor: - ri/-mor® 
8 ae ws Sons so/-n6, sa/-cer 
ic “ t “ time: ti/-mor, t6/-tus 
Vv cS w . % we: vel, vir 
qu eS qu.‘ quit: qui, qué 
1. Before a word beginning with a vowel, or with h, a final vowel, or a 
final m with a preceding vowel, seems to have been partially suppressed in 
the ordinary speech of the Romans, as well as in poetry. It was rapidly and 
indistinctly uttered, and thus it readily blended with the following vowel. 
2. Observe that i is sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, that. 
as a vowel it has, when long, the sound of i in machine or of e in me, 
and that as a consonant it has the sound of y in yet, yes. It is gener- 
ally a vowel between consonants and a consonant between vowels, and 
at the beginning of words it is generally a vowel before consonants and 
a consonant before vowels: si/-mus (se-mus), maior (mah-yor); W-re 
(e-ra), iam (yam). 
3. In the aspirated forms of the mutes, ch, ph, and th, h is in general 
  
1 This is sometimes called the parasitic u, as having been developed in many 
instances by the preceding consonant. 
2In pronouncing ae, endeavor to unite the sounds of the Latin a and e, and 
in pronouncing eu, unite the sounds of e and u; but some scholars pronounce 
ae likeeain pear, 
8B should be trilled 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    6 | PHONOLOGY 
nearly or quite silent, though sometimes heard, especially in Greek words; 
cho/-rus (ko-rus), pul’-cher (pul-ker); A-thé’nae; phi-lo’-so-phus. 
4, B has the sound of p before s and t: urbs, sub/-ter (pronounced 
urps, sup/-ter).! 
13. Syllables. — In dividing words into syllables, 
1. Make as many syllables as there are vowels and diphthongs: 
mo'-re, per-sua!-dé, mén/-sae. 
2. Join to each vowel as many of the consonants which precede 
it—one or more—as can be conveniently pronounced with it:? 
pa'-ter, pa!-trés, ge'-ne-ri, do'-mi-nus, mén/-sa, bel/-lum. But— 
3. Separate compound words into their component parts: 
ab’-es, ob-i’-re.® 
4. A syllable is said to be open when it ends in a vowel, and 
closed when it ends in a consonant. Thus in pal-ter, the first syl- 
lable is open, and the second closed. 
QUANTITY 
14. Syllables are in quantity or length either long, short, or 
common, i.e. sometimes long and sometimes short.‘ 
1. Long.— A syllable is long in quantity, (1) if it contains a 
diphthong or a long vowel: haec, rés; and (2) if its vowel is 
followed by x, or any two consonants, except a mute and a liquid: 
dux, réx, sunt. 
2. Short.—A syllable is short, if its vowel is followed by another 
vowel, by a ene or by the aspirate h: di'-és, vi'-ae, ni/-hil. 
10n Assimilatioulin Sound in this and similar cases, see 55, 1, footnote. ba caer 3 Hea 2 By some grammarians any combination of consonants which can begin either 
a Latin or a Greek word is always joined to the following vowel, as o’-mnis, 
i’-pse. Others, on the contrary, think that the Romans pronounced with each 
vowel as many of the following consonants as could be readily combined with it, 
a view which is favored by the fact that a syllable with a short vowel becomes 
long, if that vowel is followed by two consonants, except a mute and a liquid; as 
one does not see how the consonants can make the syllable long, unless one of 
them belongs to it. 
8 But it is a question whether this traditional rule represents the actual pro- 
nunciation of the Romans, as it seems probable that compounds were pronounced 
like simple words. 
4 For rules of quantity, see Prosody. Two-or three leading facts are here given 
for the conyenience of the learner. 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  ACCENTUATION 7 
8. Common. — A syllable is common if its vowel, naturally 
short, is followed by a mute and a liquid: agri? 
15. Vowels, like syllables, are either long, short, or common; 
but the quantity of the vowel does not always coincide with the 
quantity of the syllable, as a short vowel may stand in a long 
syllable. 
1. Vowels standing before x or any two consonants, except a mute and a 
liquid, are said to have hidden quantity. 
2. It is often difficult, and sometimes absolutely impossible, to determine 
the hidden quantity of vowels ; but it is thought advisable to treat vowels as 
short, unless there are good reasons for believing them to be long. 
3. Vowels are long before ns, nf, and gn: c6n/-sul, in-fé/-lix, rég’-num, 
ig/nis. 
4, The signs ~, and * are used to mark the quantity of vowels, the first 
denoting that the vowel over which it is placed is Zong, the second that it is 
common, i.e. sometimes long and sometimes short; ubi. All vowels not 
marked are to be treated as short. 
ACCENTUATION 
16. Words of two syllables are always accented on the first: 
mén'-sa. 
1. In Latin as in English accent is stress of voice. 
17. Words of more than two syllables are accented on the 
Penult, the last syllable but one, if.that is long in quantity,? 
otherwise on the Antepenult, the last but two: ho-nd!-ris, con'- 
su-lis. 
1. The enclitics, que, ve, ne, ce, met, etc., never used as separate words, 
throw back their accent upon the last syllable of the word to which they are 
appended : ho-mi-ne’-que ; mén-sa/-que; e-go!-met. 
2. Prepositions standing before their cases are treated as Proclitics, i.e. 
they are so closely united in pronunciation with the following word that they 
have no accent of their own: sub iii/-di-ce ; in-ter ré/-gés. 
  
1 That is, in the order here given, with the mute before the liquid; if the liquid 
precedes, the syllable is long. 
2 Thus the quantity of the sylable, not of the vowel, determines the place of 
the accent: regen’-tis, accented on the penult, because that syllable is long, 
though its vowel is short ; see 14, 1. 
4
-P-A-G-E-24
8 PHONOLOGY 
8. A secondary or subordinate accent is placed on the second or third 
syllable before the primary accent — on the second, if that is the first syllable 
of the word, or is long in quantity, otherwise on the third: mo/-nu-é/-runt, 
mo/-nu-e-ra/-mus, in-stau’-ra-vé/-runt. 
4, A few long words admit two secondary Accents : ho!-n6-ri/-fi-cen-tis!- 
si-mus. 
5. Certain words which have lost a final e retain the accent of the full 
form: il-lic! for il-li’-ce, il-lac! for il-la/-ce, is-tic! for is-ti/-ce, etc. ; bo-nan! 
for bo-na/-ne, tan-t6n’ for tan-td/-ne, au-din’ for au-dis!-ne, €-diic! for 
6-dii/-ce. 
6. Genitives in i for ii and vocatives in I accent the penult: in-ge’-ni for 
in-ge!-ni-i; Mer-cu’-1i. 
  18. Compounds are accented like simple words, but facis, when 
compounded with other words than prepositions, retains its own 
accent: ca-le-fa'-cit. 
19. Original Accent. — Originally all Latin words were accented 
on the first syllable. This fact must be borne in mind in explain- 
ing phonetic changes. The syllable immediately following the 
original accent, ie. the second syllable of the word, is called a 
Post-Tonic syllable. 
INHERITED VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS 
20. The Latin inherited from the parent speech the vowels, 
a, e, i, 0, u; 4, 6,1, 5, 0; and the diphthongs, ai, ei, oi, au, eu, ou; 
di, au, éu, Su. In some words these vowels have been 
preserved unchanged as in the following examples: 
    ai, éi, 
  a: agd, am6, albus a: mater, figus, clavis 
e: est, decem, ferd 6: léx, ménsis, plénus 
i: fidés, quis, minud i: vis, vivus, simus 
o: octd, domus 6- ddnum, notus 
u: super, ruber ti: mis, sis 
1. The Latin also inherited an indistinct Indo-European vowel represented 
by an inverted e; see 29. 
2. The diphthong au retains its original form in classical Latin, as in 
autem, auged; but all the other diphthongs were more or less changed 
before the classical period, though most of those which begin with a short 
vowel occur in rare instances in early Latin. 
\
-P-A-G-E-25
PHONETIC CHANGES 9 
VOWEL GRADATION, OR ABLAUT 
21. The Latin also inherited certain vowel variations, which 
appear in the different forms of certain roots, stems, and suffixes. 
1. Thus the common root of fod-i6, J dig, and f6d-1, J have dug, is fgd in 
fod-i6 and f6d in £6d-i; that of fac-id, J make, and féc-1, I have made, is 
fac and féc ; that of gen-us, offspring, and gi-gn-6, I beget, is gen and gn!; 
that of d6-num, gift, da-mus, we give, and de-d-i, I have given, is a6, da, 
and d.1 This variation in vowels is called Vowel Gradation or Ablaut. 
2. These inherited vowel variations in some languages form a somewhat 
regular gradation, but in Latin they have mostly disappeared as kindred 
forms have been assimilated to each other. 
PHONETIC CHANGES 
22. Latin words in the course of their history have undergone 
important changes in accordance with phonetic laws. 
28, The phonetic changes in vowels may be either Qualitative, 
affecting the quality of the sound, or Quantitative, affecting its 
length or quantity. 
I. Qualitative Changes in Vowels 
24. An Indo-European a may become in Latin in post-tonie “syllables : 
() e, (2) 4, (8) ior u, and (4) u. Thus: 
1. A becomes e in post-tonic closed? syllables, except before labials and 
1; factns, but cOnfectus ; captus, but acceptus. 
2. A becomes i in post-tonic open? syllables, except before labials, and in 
all post-tonic syllables before ng: ag6, but adig6 ; statud, but cOnstitud ; 
tang6, but at-tings. 
3. A becomes i or u in post-tonic open syllables before labials and before 
1: capi6, but man-cipium and man-cupium ; sali6, but in-sili6 and in- 
sulid. 
4. A becomes u in post-tonic syllables before 1+ another consonant: 
salid, but in-sultus ; calcG, but in-culcs. 
  1 Observe that the vowel sometimes disappears: gen, gn; da, d. 
2 Remember that the term post-tonic is applied to the syllable following the 
initial accent, i.e. to the second syllable of the word (19), and that a syllable ix 
said to be open when it ends in a vowel, and closed when it ends in a consonant; 
see 13, 4.
-P-A-G-E-26
    ty) PHONOLOGY 
25. An Indo-European e may become: (1) i and (2) 0. Thus: 
1. E becomes i, (1) in post-tonic syllables, except before r: legd, but 
col-ligs ; em6, but ad-im6 ; (2) in final syllables before s and t: saliites, 
saliitis; Cereres, Cereris; *leget,! legit; *reget, regit; and (8) before 
n-+a guttural: *tengud, tingusd. 
2. B may become o after an initial v: *velt, volt?; *vemd, vom. 
8. Initial sve becomes so: *svenos, sonus; *svedalis, sodalis. 
26. An Indo-European i may become: (1) e and (2)ioru. Thus: 
1. I final may become e, but it sometimes disappears as in neuter stems 
in Ali and ri (108, 1): *mari, mare; *levi, leve. 
2. I before r for s becomes e: *sisd, ser6 ; *cinisis, cineris. 
3. I becomes i or u in post-tonic syllables before labials: pontifex or 
pontufex. 
4, Final er is sometimes developed from ri-stems, as follows: *acri-s, 
*acr-s, *acer-s, acer.® 
27. An Indo-European 04 may become: (1) u, (2) e, (8) e or i, and 
(ioru. Thus: 
1. O becomes u (1) in post-tonic closed syllables: *genos, genus ; 
*donom, donum ; and (2) in accented syllables before 14+ aconsonant and. 
before n + a consonant: *molta, multa; *honc, hune ; *oncos, uncus. 
2. O becomes e when final: *isto, iste ; *sequiso, sequere. 
8. O becomes e or i in post-tonic open syllables, except before labials: 
*sociotas, societas ; *novotas, novitas. 
4. O generally becomes i, rarely u, in post-tonic open syllables before 
labials: aurifex, rarely aurufex ; maximus, maxumus. 
5. Final er is sometimes developed from ro-stems in the same way as 
from ri-stems (26, 4): *agro-s, *agr-s, *ager-s, ager. 
28. An Indo-European u becomes i or u in post-tonie syllables before 
labials: old form dissupé, later dissip6; lacruma, later lacrima. 
29. An indistinct Indo-European vowel, represented by an inverted 
e =o, generally becomes a in Latin: *dotos, datus; *sotos, satus. 
  
1The assumed form from which the Latin word, as it appears in literature, is 
supposed to have been derived, is designated by an asterisk. 
2 Volt subsequently became vult, 
8 Tin acri-s disappears, leaving F sonant, then Fr sonant. becomes er, and final 8 
disappears. 
4 After V, U, or qu, O is preserved longer than elsewhere: servos, afterward 
servus; sc mortuos, equos, etc.  
-P-A-G-E-27
  
PHONETIC CHANGES ld 
30. The Indo-European liquids and nasals, 1, r, and m, n, are vocal- 
ized in Latin; ] becomes ol, later ul, and r becomes or: *mlta, *molta, 
multa; *mrtis, mortis; m becomes em, and n, en: *dekm, decem ; 
*tntos, tentus. 
31. Assimilation of Vowels. — A vowel is sometimes assimilated to 
the vowel of the following syllable: *cdnsulium, cdnsilium ; *exsulium, 
exsilium; *mehi, mihi i *nehil, nihil; *boné, bene; *me- 
mordit, mo-mordit , *pe-poscit, po-péscit; *ce-currit, cu-currit.      
II. Qualitative Changes in Diphthongs 
32. The diphthong ai is retained in early inscriptions, but it after- 
ward becomes ae andi. Thus: 
1. Ai generally becomes ae: *laivos, laevus, scaevus, aevum. 
2. Ai becomes I both in post-tonic and in final syllables: quaeré, but 
in-quiré ; *mensais, ménsis. 
33. The diphthong ei becomes Tf in pronunciation, although sometimes 
written ei in early Latin: dic6; divus, £146, sometimes written deivus, 
feids.   
34. The diphthong oi becomes oe, di, andi. Thus: 
1. Oi becomes oe in a few words: poena, foedus. 
2. Oi becomes di in most words: *oinos, *oenos, tinus ; *moenia, mtnia. 
8. Oi becomes i in final syllables: *equoi, equi; *equois, equis. 
35. The diphthong au generally remains unchanged, but it sometimes 
becomes @ in post-tonic syllables: claud6, but in-cliido; fraudé, but 
dé-fraud6, or dé-friido. 
36. The diphthongs, eu and ou, coalesce and become &: *deucé, 
*doucd, diicd; *ious, itis. 
TII. Quantitative Changes in Vowels 
37. Vowels are lengthened before ns, nf, and gn: cdnsul, infélix, 
ignis. 
38. Vowels are often lengthened in compensation for the loss of 
consonants. Thus: 
1. For the loss of s or x in accented syllables before d,1,m, orn: *nisdos, 
nidus, English nest; *isdem, idem; *acsla, ala; *prismos, primus; *posnd, 
pon6 ; *texmd, téms,
-P-A-G-E-28
  12 PHONOLOGY 
2. For the loss of h: *mahior, maior ; *ahio, aid. 
8. A vowel lengthened before ns in final syllables remains long after the 
loss of n: *servons, servGs; *régéns, régés. 
39. Long vowels are shortened 
1, Generally before other vowels: *audiunt, audiunt ; *audiam, audiam ; 
fid&i, fideI ; réi, ref; but diéi, illius. 
2. In final syllables before 1, m, r, t, and nt: *animali, animal; *amém, 
amem ; *audiair, audiar; amat,! amat; *amint, amant. 
8. Final 4 is shortened in classical Latin in the plural of neuter nouns 
and adjectives and in the Nominative and Vocative singular of nouns in a of 
the First Declension: templa in Plautus, later templa; gravida, gravia; 
musa, musa. 
4, Final 6, I, and 6 are sometimes shortened: *malé, male; *nisi, nisi; 
*ibi, ibi; *egd, ego. 
5. The shortening of final syllables is supposed to have begun in dissylla- 
bles with iambic measurement, i.e. with short penults. In these the final 
syllable was shortened by being assimilated in quantity to the first, as amat, 
amat; bona, bona; eg6, ego. 
6. Long vowels in syllables originally accented (19) are sometimes short- 
ened, and the following consonant is doubled in compensation: Iiapiter, 
Tuppiter; litera, littera; *mit6, mitts. 
40, Vowels may disappear from a word by syncope or vowel absorp- 
tion: *re-pepuli, reppulf; *re-cecidi, reccidi; *clavidd, claud6; *pri- 
miceps, princeps; *inudecim, indecim. 
1. Final vowels sometimes disappear: *animali, animal; dice, dic; 
*sine, sin. 
41. Occasionally a short vowel, generally u, sometimes e€ or i, is 
apparently developed before a liquid or nasal: *stablom, stabulum ; 
*stablis, stabilis; but see 30. 
CONTRACTION OF VOWELS 
42. Two vowels of the same quality are contracted into the corre- 
sponding long vowel: *treies, *trees, trés; *ignees, Ignés; nihil, *niil, 
nil; *coopia, c6pia. 
43. Two vowels of different quality are contracted into a long vowel, 
generally of the quality of the first: *co-agd, c6g6; *de-agd, dég6; *pro- 
emo, proms. 
  
1¥inal at, St, and it are preserved long in Plautus and other early poets: 
versat, habét, velit.
-P-A-G-E-29
  CONSONANTS 13 
1. The changes illustrated in the following verbal forms may have been 
produced either by contraction, or by the dropping of the syllable ve or vi 
before r or s: amaveram, amaram; amavisse, amasse; névissem, 
néssem ; n6visse, ndsse. 
2. Many combinations of vowels remain uncontracted, as a6, ea, e6, ia, 
ié, ua, and ué: aéneus, eam, mone6, animalia, diés, ingenua, ingenué. 
CONSONANTS 
44. The Latin inherited the following consonants: 
1. The Mutes k, g, t, d, p, b, and the Aspirates gh, dh, bh. 
2. The Nasals m, n, and the Liquids], r. 
3. The Semivowels i and u, and the Spirant s. 
45. The Latin inherited three series of k- and g-mutes, distinguished 
as Palatals, Velars, and Labialized Velars. .These are represented in 
Latin as follows: 
1. The Palatals k and g become ¢ and g, and gh generally becomes h, but 
after n it becomes g: centum, decem, in which k becomes c ; ager, genus, 
in which g remains g; humus, hortus, in which gh becomes h; ango, 
fing6, in which gh becomes g. 
Nore.—In a few words initial gh before u becomes f: funds. 
2. The Velars are developed like palatals, velar k and g becoming ¢ and 
g, and velar gh generally becoming h, but becoming g before r: capere, 
cav6re ; griis, tegd ; hostis, hortor; gradior. 
3. The Labialized Velar k becomes qu, which becomes ¢ before conso- 
nants: quis, que, quod, in which the labialized velar k becomes qu, which 
becomes c in *coc-si, coxi. 
4, The Labialized Velar g becomes gu, which remains unchanged after 
nasals, but is reduced to g before other consonants, and to v when initial 
or between vowels: unguG, stinguG, in which the labialized velar g becomes 
gu; glans, 4gnus; venid, English come; vivus. 
5. The Labialized Velar gh becomes f, when initial, gu after n, and v 
between vowels: formus, frid ; an-guis, nin-guit ; niv-is. 
46. The Dentals t and @ generally remain unchanged: pater, sep- 
tem; decem, deus. 
1. The aspirate dh becomes f when initial: faci6, forés, English door, 
and generally d when medial, but b before r: medius; ruber. 
47. The Labials p and b generally remain unchanged: potis, pax, 
opus; lamb, libricus; but p became b in a few words, as in ab for 
*ap, ob for *op, sub for *sup, bib6 for *pibd
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  14 PHONOLOGY 
1. The aspirate bh becomes (1) f when initial: frater, English brother ; 
fer6, English bear, and (2) b when medial: al-bus, amb-itus. 
48. The Nasals m} and n and the Liquids 12 andr remain unchanged: 
medius, homo; genus, d6num; linqu6, ruber. 
49. V generally remains unchanged: ovis, aevum; but it is some- 
times lest between vowels: *nevold, nél6. 
  50. S often remains unchanged: est, sumus, suus; but it gener- 
ally becomes r between vowels:® flés, fl6ris; genus, generis. 
CHANGES IN CONSONANTS 
51. A Guttural—e, g, q (qu), or h (for gh)—before s unites with 
it and forms x: *duc-s, dux; *reg-s, réx; *coqu-sl, coxI; *trah-si, 
traxi 
1. For the loss of the guttural between a liquid and s or t, see 58, 1. 
52. Note also the following changes in consonants: 
1. Dt and tt become st before r; in other situations they generally 
become ss, reduced to s after long syllables: *rdd-trum, r6strum ; *fod-tu:\, 
fos-sus; *plaud-tus, plau-sus; *vert-tus, ver-sus. 
2. D sometimes represents an original t: aput, apud; haut, haud. 
8. Dv initial sometimes becomes b: dvellum, bellum. 
_ 4. Sr, when initial, becomes fr; otherwise br: *srigus, frigus, col, 
*fiines-ris, from fiines in fiiner-is, fiinebris. 
5. A euphonic p is generally developed between m and s and between 
mandt: *cOm-si, c6m-p-si; *cOm-tum, cOm-p-tum. 
ASSIMILATION 
58. A consonant is often assimilated to a following consonant. Thus: 
1. Dand t are often assimilated before s; ds and ts becoming ss, which 
is simplified to s when final, and after diphthongs and long vowels: *concut- 
sit, concus-sit ; *lapid-s, lapis; *art-s, ars; *amant-s, amans; *claud-sit, 
clau-sit ; *sudd-sit, sud-sit. 
  
1M, when final, was a very weak nasal, and before words beginning with a 
vowel it almost disappeared in pronunciation. 
2 appears in place of an earlier d in about a dozen Latin words: lingua, 
old form dingua; lacrima, olére. 
8R sometimes takes the place of final s, following the analogy of r for 8 
between vowels; thus honGs becomes honor from honGr-is. S may he 
retained between vowels when it stands for ss: hau-si for *haus-si.
-P-A-G-E-31
ASSIMILATION : 1k 
2. D is generally assimilated before c, qu, g, 1, n, p, and s: *hod-ce 
*hoc-ce, h6c; quid-quam, quic-quam ; *ad-ger, ag-ger; *sed-la, sel-la, 
*merced-narius, mercen-narius ; *quid-pe, equip-pe ; *claud-sit, *claus-sit, 
clau-sit. 
8. T is assimilated before c and s: *sit-cus, sic-cus; *concut-sit, 
concus-sit. 
4. Wis assimilated before 1 and m: *in-lus, illus; *gen-ma, gem-ma. 
5. R is assimilated before 1: *ager-lus, agel-lus. 
6. P is assimilated before f and m: *op-ficina, of-ficina; *sup-mus, 
sum-mus. 
7. Sis assimilated before f: *dis-ficilis, dif-ficilis. 
8. For assimilation in Compounds of Prepositions, see 374. 
54. A consonant is sometimes assimilated to a preceding consonant. 
1. D and n are generally assimilated to a preceding 1: *cal-dis, cal-lis ; 
*col-nis, col-lis ; *fal-n6, fal-16. 
2. & is assimilated to a preceding 1 or r: *facil-simus, facil-limus ; 
*vel-se, vel-le ; *fer-se, fer-re; *acer-simus, acer-rimus. 
55. Partial Assimilation. — A consonant is often partially assimilated 
to the following consonant. Thus: 
1. Before the surd s or t, a sonant b or g is generally changed to its cor- 
responding surd, p! or ec: *scrib-si, scrip-si ; *scrib-tus, scrip-tus ; *reg-si, 
réxi (51); *reg-tus, réc-tus. : 
2. Qu? and h are also changed to c before s and t: *coqu-sit, *coc-sit, 
coxit ; *coqu-tus, coc-tus ; *trah-sit, *tric-sit, traxit ; *trah-tus, trac-tus. 
8. Before a labial, p or b, n is generally changed to the labial m: 
inper6, imper6 ; inperator, imperator ; *inbellis, imbellis. 
4. Before n, a labial, p or b, is changed to the labial m in a few words: 
*sop-nos, som-nus ; *Sab-niom, Sam-nium. 
5. M is changed to the dental n regularly before dental mutes, and often 
before guttural mutes: *eum-dem, eun-dem; *edrum-dem, eGrun-dem; . 
*quem-dam, quen-dam ; *tam-tus, tan-tus; *hum-ce, hunc; *prim-ceps, 
prin-ceps ; num-quam or nun-quam ; quam-quam or quan-quam. 
  
1But b is generally retained before S$ in abs and in nouns in bs: urbs; 
and before S and t in ob and sub in compounds and derivatives: ob-servans, 
ob-tiisus, sub-scrib6, sub-ter. In these cases, however, b takes the sound of 
Pp, so that assimilation takes place in pronunciation, though not in writing. It is 
probable also that in some other consonants assimilation was observed even when 
omitted in writing. 
2 Qu is not a syllable; u in this combination is simply a parasitic sound de- 
veloped by 4, which is never found without it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
16 PHONOLOGY 
56, Dissimilation.— The meeting of consonants too closely related 
and the recurrence of the same consonant in successive syllables are 
sometimes avoided by changing one of the consonants. Thus: 
1. *Caeluleus, from caelum, becomes caeruleus. 
2. Certain suffixes of derivation have two forms, one with 1 generally used 
after r, and one with r generally used after 11; alis, aris; blum, bulum, 
brum; clum, culuim, crum; rég-dlis, popul-aris; voca-bulum, déli- 
brum ; *dra-clum, Gra-culum ; *vehi-clum, vehi-culum ; sepul-crum. 
LOSS OF CONSONANTS 
57. Of two consonants standing at the beginning of a word, the first 
often disappears; of three thus situated, the first two often disappear: 
*onatus, natus; *gnotus, nétus; *scoruscis, coruscus; stlis, lis; 
*stlocus, locus. 
58. Groups of consonants often lose one or more of their members. 
1. A guttural mute —ce, g, or qa—standing between a liquid and g or t, 
generally disappears: *mulcsit, mulsit ; *fulgsit, fulsit ; argsit, sparsit ; 
*torqusit, torsit ; *fulctus, fultus. 
2. A guttural mute occasionally disappears in other situations, especially 
before m or v: *lficmen, limen; *exagmen, examen; *iugmentum, 
ifiimentum ; *bregvis, brevis. 
3. Cs and x sometimes disappear: *liicsna, lina; *sexdecim, sédecim ; 
*sexni, séni; *axla, ala, wing. 
4. D generally disappears before se, sp, st: adscendere, ascendere ; 
adspicere, aspicere ; adstare, astare. 
5. N, xr, and s often disappear: *in-gndtus, igndtus ; *equons, equés ; 
*porscere, pOscere; *isdem, idem; *iiisdex, itidex; *prismus, primus; 
audisne, audin. 
6. I consonant generally disappears between vowels, and sometimes in 
other situations: *bi-iugae, *bi-iigae, *bi-igae, bigae; abiicere, abicere.?    
  Norre.—Separate words are sometimes united after the loss of v: si vis, 
sis, si vultis, siiltis. 
1The suffix Gris was formed from @lis by dissimilation; from clum was 
formed crum by dissimilation, and culum by developing the vocal liquid 1; 
blum and brum are both inherited, but bulum was developed from blum. 
In rég-alis, Glis is used because r precedes, but in popul-aris, aris is used be- 
cause 1 precedes. When neither 1 nor r precedes, the original suffix Alis is used. 
2 This is the approved form in verbs compounded of iacere and monosyllabic 
prepositions ; but abicere is pronounced as if written abiicere. ‘The syllable ab 
thus remains long by position.
-P-A-G-E-33
NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES 17 
7. H often disappears between vowels, or before i consonant ; prehends, 
prénd6, nihil, nil; *ahid, aid ; *mahior, maior. 
8. For the assimilation and loss of d and t before s, see 58, 1. 
59. Loss of Final Consonants. — Final consonants often disappear. 
1. Final d disappeared at a very early date after long vowels and after r: 
sententiad, sententia, ablative; praedad, praeda; *datéd, daté, impera- 
tive; *habétdd, habét6; *cord, cor. 
2. Final t disappears after c and s: *lact (lact-is), lac, *ost, os. 
3. Final n disappears in the Nominative singular from stems in Gn, on: 
*ledn, led ; *homon, hom6 ; *egon, ego. 
4. Final os disappears in the Nominative singular from stems in ro, and 
tinal s sometimes disappears in early inscriptions from other stems in o: 
*pueros, puer ; *viros, vir; RGscios, Réscio, later Roscius; Cornélios, 
Cornélio.

PART II.— MORPHOLOGY 
60. Morphology treats of the Form and Inflection of words. 
61. The Parts of Speech are—Nouns, Adjectives, Pronouns, 
Verbs, Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections. 
NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES 
* 
62. Nouns, or Substantives, are Names, as of persons, places, 
or things: Cicerd, Cicero; Roma, Rome; domus, house. 
1. A Proper Noun is a proper name, as of a person or place: Ciceré, 
Roma. 
2. A Common Noun, or Appellative, is a name common to allt the mem- 
bers of a class of objects ; vir, man; equus, horse. Common nouns include 
Collective Nouns, designating a collection of objects: populus, people ; 
exercitus, army. 
Abstract Nouns, designating properties or qualities: virtiis, virtue; 
iistitia, justice. 
Material Nouns, designating materials as such: aurum, gold; lignum. 
wood; aqua, water. 
63. Adjectives qualify nouns: bonus, good; magnus, great; 
bonus vir, a good man. 
64. Nouns and Adjectives have Gender, Number, and Case.

-P-A-G-E-34
  13 MORPHOLOGY 
GENDER 
65. There are three genders — Masculine, Feminine, and 
Neuter. 
66. Natural and Grammatical Gender.—In Latin gender is 
either Natural, as dependent upon sex, or Grammatical, as depen- 
dent upon an artificial distinction according to grammatical rules. 
Watural Gender 
67. The names of Persons have Natural Gender. They are 
accordingly 
1. Masculine, if they denote males: Caesar, Caesar; vir, man ; 
réx, king. 
2. Feminine, if they denote females: Tullia, Twllia; mulier, 
woman; régina, queen. 
3. Both Masculine and Feminine, if they are applicable to 
both sexes: civis, citizen, male or female; homo, a hwman being, 
man or woman; but when used without distinct reference to sex, 
such nouns are generally masculine. 
Nore.— A few names of the lower animals are sometimes used in the 
same way: b6s, ox, or cow; canis, dog, male or female ; anser, gander, or 
goose. But some names of the lower animals, though applicable to both 
sexes, ha¥e only grammatical gender determined by their endings (71): cor- 
vus, raven, masculine ; aquila, eagle, feminine. 
Rules for Grammatical Gender 
68. Masculine. —The names of Rivers, Winds, and Months are 
masculine: Rhénus, the Rhine; Notus, the South Wind; Martius, 
March; but 
1. The endings of some of these nouns give them a gender at variance 
with this rule. Thus names of rivers in a are feminine: Albula, the river 
Albula; Allia, the Allia. 
69. Feminine. — The names of Countries, Towns, Islands, and 
Trees are feminine: Graecia, Greece; Roma, Rome; Délos, the 
Island of Delos; pirus, pear tree; but 
1. The endings of some of these nouns give them a gender at variance 
with this rule. Thus plurals in i and a few other nouns are masculine 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
CASES, DECLENSION 19 
and nouns in um are neuter: Delphi, Pontus; oleaster, wild olive tree ; 
pinaster, jir tree, masculine; Latium, Saguntum, neuter. 
70. Neuter. —Indeclinable nouns, Infinitives and clauses used 
as nouns are neuter: alpha, the Greek letter alpha, a; fas, the 
right ; taum amare, your loving. 
71. Gender by Endings.—In most nouns and adjectives the 
grammatical gender is determined by the ending of the Nomina- 
tive singular. Thus nouns and adjectives of the Second Declen- 
sion (82) in us are masculine: amicus, friend ; bonus, good ; nouns 
and adjectives in a are feminine: ménsa, table; bona, good; and 
nouns and adjectives in um are neuter: templum, éemple ; bonum, 
-good. 
PERSON AND NUMBER 
72. The Latin, like the English, has three Persons, the First 
Person denoting the speaker; the Second, the person spoken to; 
the Third, the person spoken of; and two Numbers, the Singular 
denoting one, and the Plural, more than one. 
CASES 
73. The Latin, unlike the English, has six cases: 
Names English Equivalents 
Nominative Nominative, Case of the Subject 
Vocative Nominative, as the Case of Address 
Genitive Possessive, or Objective with of 
Dative Objective with to or for 
Accusative Objective after a Verb or a Preposition 
Ablative Objective with from, with, by, in 
1. Oblique Cases. —The Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Ablative are 
called the Oblique Cases. 
2. Locative: —The Latin has also a few remnants of another case, called 
the Locative, denoting the Place in Which. 
DECLENSION 
74. Stem and Suffixes. — The process by which the several cases 
of a word are formed is called Declension. It consists in the 
addition of certain suffixes to one common base called the stem.  
-P-A-G-E-36
20 MORPHOLOGY 
1. Meaning. — Accordingly, each case form contains two distinct ele- 
ments —the Stem,! which gives the general meaning of the word, and the 
Case Suffix, which shows the relation of that meaning to some other word. 
Thus, in rég-is, of a king, the general idea, king, is denoted by the stem rég; 
the relation of, by the suffix is. 
2. Characteristic. — The last letter of the stem is called the Stem Charac- 
teristic, or Stem Ending. 
8. Case Endings. — The case suffixes appear distinct and unchanged only 
in nouns and adjectives with consonant stems, while in all other words they 
are seen only in combination with the characteristic, ie. with the final 
vowel of the stem, The ending produced by the union of the case suffix with 
the characteristic vowel is called a Case Ending. 
Cases Identical in Form 
75. 1. The Nominative and Vocative are alike in form, except 
in the singular of nouns and adjectives in us of the Second 
Declension and in a few Greek nouns. In all other words the 
Vocative is simply the Nominative used in address, as the Nomi: 
native is used in English. 
2. The Nominative, Vocative, and Accusative in neuters are 
alike and in the plural end-in a. 
3. The Dative and Ablative plural are alike. 
76. Five Declensions.—In Latin there are five declensions, dis- 
tinguished from each other by the endings of the Genitive singular, 
or by the stem characteristic, best seen in the Genitive plural, as 
follows: F 
  Declension. Gen. Sing. Ending Characteristic Gen. Plar.

1. The five declensions were inherited from the parent speech. 
77. The First, Second, and Third Declensions contain both 
nouns and adjectives; the Fourth and Fifth only nouns. 
  
1In many words the stem itself is derived from a more primitive form called 
a Root. For the distinction between roots and stems, see 820, 1. 
2 The 6 in serv-6-rum was originally short; hence the characteristic is 0. 
8 In this word the characteristic is t.

1 These case endings will serve as a practical guide to the learner in distin- 
guishing the different cases. The two elements which originally composed them 
have undergone various changes, and in certain cases, the one or the other has 
nearly or quite disappeared. 
2N.V.= Nom. and Voc. As the Vocative is only a special use of the Nomi- 
native, it is combined with that case in the paradigm. 
8 The Ablative, used sometimes with a preposition and sometimes without, is 
variously rendered, but the Ablative of personal appellatives takes a preposition, 
as & or ab, from, by ; cum, with, etc.; & bona régina, from or by the good queen.

1. Stems.—In nouns and adjectives of the First Declension, the stem 
ends in 4, shortened in the Nominative and Vocative singular. Thus the 
stem ménsa& becomes ménsa in the Nominative, bona becomes bona, and 
régina, régina. 
2. In the paradigms, observe that the several cases are distinguished from 
each other by their case endings. 
3. Examples for Practice. — Like ménsa and bona decline: Ala, wing; 
causa, cause; puella, girl; beata, happy; longa, long; pulchra, beau- 
tiful. 
4. Locative. — Names of towns and a few other words have a Locative 
singular in ae, denoting the Place In Which any thing is or is done: R6mae, 
at Rome ; militiae, in war. In the plural the Locative meaning is expressed 
by the ending is: Athénis, at Athens. 
5. Exceptions in Gender.— A few nouns in a are masculine by signi- 
fication: agricola, husbandman ; see 67,1. Hadria, Adriatic Sea, is mas- 
culine; sometimes also damma, deer, and talpa, mole. 
6. Article. — The Latin has no article: cor6na, crown, a crown, the 
crown. 
7. Original Case Endings. — The following are the original case endings 
with the forms which they assumed in the classical period :

mater, filius and filia: paterfamilias, father of a family. 
3. aI in the Genitive singular in the poets: aulai, afterwards aulae, 
of a hall.

SECOND DECLENSION 23 
4, Ad in the Ablative singular in early Latin: sententiad, later senten- 
tia, by the opinion. 
80. Two other case endings, common in some other declensions, 
but rare in this, are 
1. um! in the Genitive plural, chiefly in the poets: agricolum = agrico- 
larum, of farmers ; Dardanidum, of the descendants of Dardanus. 
2. Abus? in the Dative and Ablative plural, especially in dea, goddess, 
and filia, daughter, to distinguish them from the same cases of deus, god, 
and filius, son : deabus, Sor the goddesses. 
81. Greek Nouns. — Nouns of this declension in @, as, and 
és are of Greek origin, but in the plural they have assumed 
the Latin declension, as seen in ménsa. In the singular they 
are declined as follows: 
Epitomé, Aenéas, Pyrités, 
epitome. Aeneas. pyrites.

Gen. epitomés Aenéae pyritae 
Dat. epitomae Aenéae pyritae 
Ace. epitomén Aenéam, Aenéan pyritén 
Abl. epitomé Aenéa pyrité, pyrita 
1. In nouns in 6 and 6s, the stem ending a is changed to é in certain 
cases. The stem of epitomé is epitoma, of Aenéas, Aené4, and of pyri- 
tés, pyrita. 
2. Many Greek nouns assume the Latin ending a and are declined like 
ménsa. Many in é have also a form in a: epitomé, epitoma.

82. Latin nouns and ‘adjectives of the Second Declension end 
in us, in x, from which us has been dropped, or in um. Those in i: : ; us.and r are masculine, those in um neuter.

1. Stem.—In nouns and adjectives of the Second Declension, the stem 
ends in o with an ablaut form e, seen in the Vocative singular masculine, 
O becomes uinus and um. The stem of amicus is amico, of bonus and 
bonum, bond, and of templum, templo. ‘The Nominative masculine adds 
s and the neuterm: amicu-s, templu-m. 
2. In the paradigms, observe that bonus is declined precisely like ami- 
cus, and bonum like templum. 
8. Like amicus decline dominus, master ; like templum, bellum, war ; 
like bonus, beAtus, happy; like bonum, beatum, happy. 
4, Locative. —Names of towns and a few other words have a Locative 
singular in I: Ephest, at Ephesus; Corinthi, at Corinth; domi, at home; 
beili, in war. In the plural the Locative meaning is expressed by the end- 
ingis: Argis, at Argos. 
5. Genuine Latin Proper Names in ius and the word filius form the 
Vocative singular in I and accent the penult : Mercu'-ri, Mercury ; fili, son. 
. Proper names in 6ius have &i or ei: Pompéi or Pompéi. 
6. Nouns in ius and ium have in the Genitive singular ii or i, without 
a change of accent: fi-lii, fi/-1i, of a son; Clau-dii, Clau’di, of Claudius ; 
inge-nii, inge’-ni, of genius. The latter form was in general use under the 
Republic, but the former became common in the age of Augustus; both are 
used in editions of classical authors. In proper names many editors retain 
the Genitive ini: Pibli Vergi!-li, of Publius Vergilius. 
7. Deus, god, lacks the Vocative singular in cl: sal Latin, but is other- 
wise-regular in that number. It is declined in the plural as follows:

10. The original endings os and om were retained after u and v until the 
Augustan age: ingenuos, ingenuom, free-born; servos, servom, slave ; 
1These may have been originally s-stems which by the loss of s became 
o-stems. Pelagus is a Greek noun, and in general is used only in the singu- 
lar, though pelagé occurs as an Ace. plur. Virus and vulgus are used only 
in the singular. Vulgus has a masculine Accusative, vulgum, in addition to 
the neuter form vulgus. 
2The endings us and e are seen only in nouns and adjectives in us. In the 
masculine of nouns and adjectives in r, the Nominative has lost the ending us, 
and the Vocative is like the Nominative. 
8 The final iis probably borrowed from the Pronominal Declension. 
4A later formation after the analogy of the Genitive ending rum.     
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  26 MORPHOLOGY © 
equos, equom, horse; but during the reign of Augustus us and um became 
the common endings for all words of this class, though in some editions, 
especially of the earlier writers, os and om are still retained. 
84. Old and Rare Case Endings: — The following occur?: 
1. 6d in the Ablative singular: Gnaivéd, later Gnaed ; meritdd, later 
merits, from merit. 
2. @in the plural of neuters: templa, later templa. 
3. um in the Genitive plural of certain nouns denoting money, weight, 
and measure : talentum = talent6rum, of talents ; séstertium = séstertid- 
rum, of sesterces ; also ina few other words: liberum, of children ; Argivum, 
of the Argives. 
    85. Nouns and adjectives in r of the Second Declension have 
lost the case ending us in the Nominative singular, and are 
declined as follows: 
Puer, Liber, Ager, Ruber, 
boy. Sree. Jfield. red.

1. In the paradigms, observe that puer and ager differ in declension from 
amicus, in dropping the ending us in the Nominative, and in forming no 
separate Vocative: Nom. puer from puer-us. 
2. Liber is declined like puer, and ruber like ager. 
8. The stem of puer is puero, of liber, libero, of ager, agro, and of 
ruber, rubro. 
4, Ager was formed from agros thus: *agr-o-s, *agr-s, *ager-s, ager.? 
  
  1 A few other endings occur in inscriptions. 
2 First 0 disappears, leaving f sonant, then Y becomes er, *ager-s, and finally 8 
disappears, leaving ager.

SECOND DECLENSION 27 
5. Like puer decline gener, son-in-law; like ager, magister, master; 
like liber, miser, wnhappy; like ruber, niger, black. 
86. Most nouns and adjectives inr of this declension are declined 
like ager and ruber, but the following nouns are declined like puer: 
1. Vir, man, and its compounds: vir, virl, etc.; triumvir, triumviri, 
etc., member of a triumvirate. 
2. Compounds in fer and ger: armiger, armigeri, armor bearer; signi- 
fer, signiferi, standard bearer. 
8. Adulter, adulterer; Celtibér,! Celtiberian; gener, son-in-law; 
Hibér,! Spaniard; Liber, Bacchus; liberi, children; Mulciber,! Vul- 
can; presbyter, elder; socer, father-in-law; vesper, evening. 
4, For Adjectives, thus declined, see 92. 
EXCEPTIONS IN GENDER 
87. A few nouns in us are Feminine: 
1. Most names of Countries, Towns, Islands, and Trees: Aegyptus, 
Egypt ; Corinthus, Corinth; Cyprus, Cyprus ; pirus, pear tree. 
2. A few words in us of Greek origin: methodus, method; synodus, 
synod; diphthongus, diphthong. 
8. Five other words in us: alvus, belly; carbasus, linen ; colus, dis- 
taf; humus, ground; vannus, fan. \ 
88. Three nouns in us are Neuter: pelagus, sea; virus, poison; 
vulgus, the common people. 
89. Greek Nouns. —Nouns of the second declension in os, ds, 
generally masculine, and in on, neuter, are of Greek origin. They 
are declined in the singular as follows: 
  Délos, f.,2 Androgeds, Tlion, 
Delos. Androgeos. Ilium. 
Srveurar 
Nom. Délos as Voo. Déle } Androgeds 
Gen. Dé Androge6, Androgei 
Dat. Das Androged 
Accs Délon Androge6n, Androge6 
Abi. Des Androge6 
  1 Celtibér and Hibér have 6 long in the Genitive as in the Nominative, and 
Maulciber sometimes drops e. 
2 Observe that Delos, the Island Delos, is feminine by signification.  
-P-A-G-E-44
28 MORPHOLOGY 
1. The plural of nouns in os and on is generally regular, but certain 
Greek endings occur, as oe in the Nominative plural, and Gn in the Geni- 
tive plural: Arctoe, the constellation of the Bears; Theraedn, of the 
Theraeans. 
2. In the paradigms, the stems are Délo, Androge6, and Ilio. 
8, Most Greek nouns generally assume the Latin forms in us and um and 
are declined like amicus and templum. Many in os and on have also a 
form in us and um, or at least assume the regular Latin forms in some of 
their cases. 
4. For Greek nouns in eus, see Orpheus, 110. 
5. Panthiis has Voc. Panthii. For pelagus, see 83, 8. 
ADJECTIVES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND DECLENSIONS 
90. Adjectives of the First and Second Declensions, as we have 
already seen, are declined like nouns of the same endings, but 
unlike nouns, each of these adjectives has three different forms, 
one for each of the three genders. Thus bonus is the form of the 
adjective when used with masculine nouns, bona with feminine, 
and bonum with neuter: bonus amicus, a good friend; bona régina, 
a good queen; bonum templum, a good temple.

1. In the paradigms observe that in the masculine bonus is declined like 
amicus, liber like puer, and ruber like ager, and that in the feminine and 
neuter all the examples are declined alike: bona, libera, rubra like ménsa ; 
bonum, liberum and rubrum like templum, and that all these forms con- 
tain the full stem, while in the masculine liber and ruber lose the stem 
vowel o in the Nominative and Vocative singular. 
2. Adjectives in ius, unlike nouns with this ending, always have ie and 
ii in the Vocative and Genitive singular: égregius, excellent; égregie, 
égregii.
-P-A-G-E-46
  30 MORPHOLOGY 
92. Most adjectives in r of the Second Declension are declined 
like ruber, but the following are declined like liber: 
1. Satur, sated; satur, satura, saturum. 
2. Compounds in fer and ger: morti-fer, deadly ; ali-ger, winged. 
3. Asper, rough; dexter, right; lacer, torn; miser, wretched; prés- 
per, prosperous ; tener, tender; but asper and dexter are sometimes de- 
clined like ruber: asper, aspra, asprum ; dexter, dextra, dextrum. 
93. Irregularities. —The following nine adjectives have in the 
singular ius in the Genitive and i in the Dative: 
tmus ina wtnum one, alone alius alia aliud another 
sdlus sdla sdlum alone alter altera alterum the other 
totus tota totum whole utra utrum which 
  illus alla illum any ‘neuter neutra neutrum neither 
nillus nilla nillum hot any = 
1. The endings ius, i, and ud, as in ali-ud, are regular endings in the 
Pronominal Declension, from which they are borrowed; see ist-Ius, ist-i, 
ist-ud (179). 
2. Alius, regular in the plural, has one or two special irregularities in 
the singular, as follows: 
Nom. alius alia aliud? 
Gen. alius alius _ alfus 
Dat. alit alit alit 
Acc. alium aliam aliud 
Abl. alid alia aid 
8. Alius, for aliius by contraction, is rare; its place is sometimes sup- 
plied by alterius, the Genitive of alter, and sometimes by aliénus, Delong- 
ing to another. 
4. In the rest of these adjectives, the irregularity is confined to the Geni- 
tive and Dative endings, tus and 1, but i in ius is often shortened by the 
poets; regularly in alterius in dactylic verse. 
5. The regular forms occasionally occur in the Genitive and Dative singu- 
lar of some of these adjectives. 
6. Like uter are declined its compounds: uterque, utervis, uterlibet, 
utercunque, but i is short in utriusque. 
7. In alter uter, both parts are declined: alterius utrius, hut in alter- 
uter, only the latter part is declined: alterutrius. 
  1 Alis for alius and alid for aliud, from the stem ali seen in aliquis, some 
one, are rare.

stems are fl6s, itis, opos, opes, corpos, that the Nominative and 
Vocative singular take no suffix, that s of the stem becomes r between 
two vowels: fl6és, fl6ris, and that opus has the variable vowel e, u, and 
corpus, 0, u. 
2. Like flds are declined glés, sister-in-law; mds, custom; r6s, dew. 
For nep6s, see 97. 
38. Like itis is declined criis, leg. Note also mis, miiris, mouse ; tellis, 
telliris, earth. 
4. Like opus are declined foedus, fiinus, genus, glomus, latus, minus, 
onus, pondus, riidus, scelus, sidus, ulcus, vellus, viscus, vulnus. Note 
also Venus, Veneris, feminine. 
5. Like corpus are declined decus, dédecus, facinus, faenus, frigus, 
litus, nemus, pectus, pecus, tempus, tergus. 
6. A few stems in 6s finally became r-stems, as the r of the oblique cases 
gradually usurped the place of the original s in the Nominative singular: 
hon6s, honGris ; honor, honGris. 
7. A few nouns in és, as cladés, fidés, niibés, sédés, etc., lose the 
original s of the stem in the oblique cases and assume some of the character- 
istics of i-stems ; see 105. 
1 Opus and corpus are both inflected from stems formed by means of an 
Indo-European suffix with the ablaut forms os, es; the form os, weakened to 
us, when final, is the basis of the inflection of corpus; the form os, weakened 
to us, is also seen in the Nom., Voe,, and Ace. sing. of opus, but the form es 
appears in all the other cases.

1. Stems and Case Endings. — In these paradigms observe that the stems 
are tussi, navi, igni, and auri, that the case endings contain the characteris- 
tic i, and that tussis, navis, ignis, and auris, differ in declension only in 
the Accusative and Ablative singular, tussis showing the final i of the stem 
in both of these cases, navis sometimes in both, ignis sometimes in the 
Ablative but not in the Accusative, auris in neither. 
2. Like tussis— Acc. im, Abl. i—are declined biris, plow-tail; sitis, 
thirst, and in the singular, names of rivers and towns in is, with the Geni- 
tive in is: Albis, the Elbe; Tiberis, the Tiber; Hispalis, Seville; Nea- 
polis, Naples.

Nominative, Vocative, and Accusative singular of cubile, and dropped in 
the same cases of animal, for *animiile, and calear, for *calcare ; see 26, 1, 
and 40, 1; and that the case endings include the stem ending i. 
2. A few nouns have e in the Ablative singular, as names of towns in e: 
Praeneste ; generally réte, net, and in poetry sometimes mare.

1. Paradigms. —Observe that these nouns are declined in the singular 
like consonant stems, and in the plural like i-stems. 
106. To this class belong the following nouns: 
1. Nouns in és, Gen. in is: caedés, slaughter ; cladés, disaster ; sédés, 
seat; strués, heap; subolés, sprout, although several of these are occasion- 
ally used as consonant stems, and a very few are generally so used, as 
ambagés (pl.), roundabout way; prolés, offspring; sédés; subolés; and 
vatés, soothsayer. 
2. Most nouns in ns and rs?: cliéns, client; cohors, cohort.

1. Stems.—In the paradigms observe that the stems of siis and bGs are 
sti and bou; that the diphthong ou of the stem bou becomes 6 in bés and 
b6bus, i in biibus, and ov in the other forms; that the stem nigv unites 
with s and forms nix ; that it becomes niv in the other forms of the singu- 
lar, and assumes i in the plural; and that senex is declined from two stems, 
senec and sen, and vis from two, vi and visi, which becomes viri. 
2. Sis and gris, crane, the only i-stems in this declension, are declined 
alike, except in the Dative and Ablative plural, where gris is regular, 
gruibus. 
3. Iuppiter (Iou-piter ; piter = pater) is thus declined: Iuppiter, Iovis, 
Iovi, Iovem, Iove. The stem Iou became Ii in Ii-piter, which finally be- 
came Iuppiter, but it became Iov in the oblique cases. 
4, Case Suffixes and Case Endings. —'The following are the original case 
suffixes and case endings for masculine and feminine nouns, with the forms 
which they assume in the classical period :

i-stems borrow the ending is of the Genitive singular from consonant stems. 
5. Neuter nouns have the same case suffixes and endings as m 
and feminines, except in the Nominative and Accusative, where, if conso- 
nant stems, they take no suffix in the singular, and the suffix a, from an 
original 4, in the plural, and if i-stems, they have the ending e, from an 
original i, in the singular, and ia, from an original ia, in the plural. 
6. Early and Rare Endings. — The following occur: 
  es and us in the Gen. sing.: saliites = saliitis ; hominus = hominis. 
e in the Dat. sing.: aere = aerI; Marte = Marti. 
id in the Abl. sing.: marid = mari. 
éis and is in the Nom. plur.: civeis and civis = civés. 
éis in the Ace. plur.: civéis = civés or civis. 
LOCATIVE CASE 
108. Many names of towns have a Locative singular in i or e, 
denoting the Place in Which any thing is or is done: Carthagini, 
or Carthagine, at Carthage; Tiburi, or Tibure, at Tibur. In the 
plural the Locative meaning is expressed by the ending ibus: 
Gadibus, at Gades. 
  
1 Borrowed from i-stems. 
2 Borrowed from consonant stems. 
8 But istems often borrow from consonant stems the endings em and 6s for 
im and is.

between different declensions: between Decl. I, Orphei, Orpheé, 
Orpheum, and Decl. III., Orpheu, Orpheos, Orphei, Orphea. 
8. Greek feminines in 6 may be declined either with tis in the Genitive 
and with 6 in the other cases, as Did6, Didiis, Did6, etc., or regularly from 
the stem in 6n, as Did6, Diddnis, DidGni, DidGnem, DidGne. 
4. Nouns in clés are declined as follows: Periclés: Voc. Periclés, 
Periclé ; Gen. Periclis, Pericli; Dat. Pericli, or Pericli; Acc. Periclem, 
Periclén, or Periclea ; Abl. Pericle. 
5. Greek neuters in a, Gen. in,atis or atos, often have is for ibus in the 
Dative and Ablative plural, and sometimes Grum for um in the Genitive 
plural: poéma, poem; poématis or poématibus ; poématGrum or poé- 
matum. 
6. Vocative Singular.—Greek nouns in is, ys, and eus generally have 
the Vocative singular like the stem, as in the paradigms; but those in 4s, 
Gen. in antis, have the Vocative in a: Atlas, Atla. 
7. In the Genitive plural, the ending 6n occurs in a few titles of books: 
Metamorphésés (title of a poem), Metamorphése6n. 
8. In the Dative and Ablative plural the ending si, sin, occurs in poetry: 
Troadés, Troasin. 
9. A few neuters used only in the Nominative, Vocative, and Accusative 
have os in the singular and é in the plural: melos, melé, song.

ADJECTIVES OF THE* THIRD DECLENSION 
125. Adjectives of the Third Declension may be divided into 
three classes: 
I. Those which have in the Nominative singular three different 
forms — one for each gender: I-Stems. 
IL. Those which have two forms — the masculine and feminine 
being the same: Consonant and I-Stems. 
III. Those which have but one form—the same for all gen- 
ders: Consonant and I-Stems.

    48 MORPHOLOGY 
1. The participle amans differs in declension from the adjective pridéns 
only in the Ablative singular, where the participle usually has the ending e 
and the adjective I. Participles used as adjectives generally have i. 
2. A few adjectives have only e in general use in the Ablative singular, 
especially those in es, Gen. in itis or idis: ales, déses, dives, sdspes, 
superstes, and caelebs, compos, impos, pauper, princeps, ptibes. 
129. Neuter Plural.— Many adjectives from the nature of their sig- 
nification are rare in the neuter. Some of these, like memor, lack the 
neuter plural; all others have the ending ia, in the Nominative and 
Accusative, except tiber, iibera, fertile, and vetus, vetera. 
130. Genitive Plural.— Most adjectives of the Third Declension have 
ium in the Genitive plural, but the following have um: 
1. Adjectives compounded with substantives which have um: inops 
(opum), inopum, helpless ; quadrupés, quadrupedum, fowr-footed. 
2. Those which have only e in the Ablative singular (128, 2): pauper, 
paupere, pauperum, poor; sdspes, sOspite, sdspitum, safe; compos, 
compote, compotum, master of. 
8. Those which have the Genitive in eris, oris, uris: vetus, veterum, 
old; memor, memorum, mindful ; cicur, cicurum, tame, and a few others. 
4, The poets and late writers often use um in words which have ium in 
classical prose. 
FOURTH DECLENSION 
U-Nouns 
131. Nouns of the Fourth Declension end in us-and_a. Those

  FOURTH DECLENSION 49 
1. Here the stems are friictu and cornu, and the case endings contain 
the characteristic u, weakened:-to iin ibus, but retained in ubus. 
2. A few nouns retain wbus in the Dative and Ablative plural : regularly 
tribus, tribe ; generally acus, needle ; arcus, bow ; artus, joint ; lacus, lake ; 
partus, birth; and sometimes portus, arbor ; specus, cave ; verti, spit; 
and a few other words. ‘ 
38. In early Latin the endings uis, uos, and i occur in the Genitive singu- 
lar: friictuis, of fruit; sendtuos and senat?, of %he senate. Senati is 
found even in Cicero. The Genitive in Tis common in Plautus and Terence, 
as adventi, friicti, gemiti, quaesti, etc. 
4. A Dative in ii, the régular form in nouns in @, also occurs in nouns in 
us, but chiefly in poetry: friictii = friictui.

EXCEPTIONS IN GENDER 
132. The following nouns in us are feminine: acus, needle; colus, 
distaff; domus, house; Tdtis; Ides; manus, hand; porticus, portico, 
quinquatris, feast of Minerva; tribus, tribe. 
1 The @ in the Nom. and Ace. of neuters is of uncertain origin, perhaps a plural 
or dual formation. 
2 The Dative in G, used both as masculine and as neuter, is in origin a Loca- 
tive formation. 
8 The ending G-d, from which ti was derived, was not inherited, but was formed 
after the analogy of the Ablative ending 6-d from o stems, as in Gnaiv-6-d, 
HARK, LAT. GRAM.— 5

  50 MORPHOLOGY 
1. The only neuter nouns in common use are corni, genii, and veri, 
but neuter forms are sometimes found in certain cases of other words, as 
artua from artus. 
183. Second and Fourth Declensions.— Some nouns are partly of the 
Fourth Declension and partly of the Second. 
1. Domus, f., house, has 4 Locative, domi, at home, and is otherwise 
declined as follows:

2. Certain names of trees in us, as cupressus, ficus, laurus, pinus, 
though generally of the Second Declension, sometimes take those cases 
of the Fourth which end in ts, us, and a: N. V. laurus; Gen. lauri, 
lauriis; Dat.laur6; Acc. laurum; Abl. lauré, lauri, etc. So also colus,

  TABLE OF GENDER 51 
1. The case endings here given contain the characteristic 6, which appears 
in all the cases. It is shortened generally in the ending €i, when preceded 
by a consonant, and regularly in the ending em. 
2. The Genitive and Dative singular sometimes end in 6, and sometimes, 
though rarely, in I for 1, chiefly in poetry: acié,! dié, fidé, dil, facii.1 
Norse. — These forms in € are Locatives in origin, and they have retained 
their original Locative meaning in a few phrases found in early Latin, as 
dié septimi, on the seventh day; dié crastini, on the morrow. Cottidié, 
hodié, pridié, and the like are doubtless Locatives in origin. 
8. In early Latin the Genitive sometimes ends in 6s: diés, of a day. 
4, Diés and rés are the only nouns in this declension complete in all 
their parts. In other nouns the plural forms, especially the Genitive, Dative, 
and Ablative, are rare in the best writers.

INDECLINABLE NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES 
137. A very few nouns and adjectives are indeclinable, hav- 
ing but one form for all cases. The following are the most 
important : 
1. The letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, alpha, béta, etc. 
2. Pas, right; nefas, wrong; nihil, nothing; Instar, likeness ; mane, 
morning.” 
83. A very few adjectives: friigi, frugal, good; néquam, worthless; 
mille, thousand ; potis, able. 
DEFECTIVE NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES 
138. Many nouns, from the nature of their meaning, are used 
chiefly in the singular. To these belong 
1. The names of Persons and many names of Places: Cicer6, Caesar, 
Réma, Rome; Graecia, Greece ; but Proper names admit the plural to des- 
inate Families or Classes: ScipiGnés, the Scipios ; Caesarés, the Caesars. 
  
1 For exceptions, see under the several declensions. 
2 But these nouns are not only indeclinable, but also defective, as they are 
regularly used only in the Nominative and Accusative singular, though mane 
also occurs as a Locative Ablative.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
DEFECTIVE NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES 53 
2. Most Abstract nouns: fidés, faith ; itistitia, justice; but many ab- 
stract nouns admit the plural to designate instances, or kinds of the quality : 
avaritiae, instances of uvarice; odia, hatreds. In the poets the plural is 
often used in the sense of the singular. 
8. The names of Materials: aurum, gold; ferrum, iron; but the plural 
may be used to designate pieces of the material, or articles made of it; 
aera, vessels of copper. 
4. A few special nouns: meridiés, mid-day; specimen, example; su- 
pellex, furniture ; vér, spring ; vespera, evening, etc. 
139. Many nouns, from the nature of their meaning, are used 
only in the plural. ‘To these belong 
1. Certain Personal Appellatives applicable to Classes: maiérés, fore- 
Jathers ; posteri, descendants ; gemini, twins; liberi, children. An indi- 
vidual member of such a class may be denoted by tinus ex with the plural : 
dinus ex liberis, one of the children, or a child. 
2. Many names of Cities: Athénae, Athens; Thébae, Thebes ; Delphi, 
Delphi. 
3. Many names of Festivals: Bacchanflia, the Bacchanalian Festival ; 
Olympia, the Olympian Games. Here the plural may refer to the various 
games and exercises which together constituted the festival. 
4. Certain special nouns: arma, arms; divitiae, riches; exsequiae, 
rites; exuviae, spoils; Tdiis, Ides; indiitiae, truce ; Insidiae, ambuscade ; 
manés, shades of the dead ; minae, threats ; moenia, walls ; miinia, duties ; 
niptiae, nuptials ; reliquiae, remains. 
140. Plural with Change of Meaning. —Some nouns have one 
signification in the singular and another in the plural. Thus: 
aedés, temple aedés, (1) temples, (2) a house? 
auxilium, help auxilia, auwiliaries 
earcer, prison, barrier carcerés, barriers of a race course 
castrum, castle, hut castra, camp 
comitium, place of assembly comitia, the assembly held in the comitium 
copia, plenty, force cdpiae, (1) stores, (2) troops 
facultas, ability facultatés, wealth, means 
finis, end finés, borders, territory 
fortiina, fortune fortiinae, possessions, wealth 
gratia, gratitude, favor gratiae, thanks 
hortus, garden horti, (1) gardens, (2) park 
  
1 Aedés and some other words in this list, it will be observed, have in the 
plural two significations, one corresponding to that of the singular, and the other 
distinct from it.

141. Many nouns, entire in the singular, lack certain forms of 
the plural. Thus: 
1. Most nouns of the Fifth Declension, a few of the Fourth, and several 
monosyllabic neuters of the Third, are seldom, if ever, used in the Genitive, 
Dative, or Ablative plural: aciés, sharpness ; effigiés, likeness; speciés, 
appearance, etc. ; metus, fear; situs, situation, etc.; far, corn; fel, gall; 
mel, honey, etc. 
2. Many nouns, especially monosyllables, otherwise entire, lack the Geni- 
tive plural: nex, death ; pax, peace; pix, pitch; cor, heart; cds, whet- 
stone; sal, salt; s601, sun; lax, light. 
142. Some nouns, entire in the plural, lack certain forms of 
the singular. The following are the most important:

143. A few nouns are used only in certain cases of the singular: 
N.V. Gen. Dat. Ace. Abl. Meaning 
fors _ _ _ forte chance 
lués —_ —_ luem lue pestilence 
1. A few verbal nouns in i, and a few others, have only the Ablative 
singular in general use: iussii, by order; mandati, by command ; rogati, 
by request ; sponte, by choice, etc. 
144. Defective Adjectives. —A few adjectives, from the nature of 
their meaning, are used chiefly in the plural, while others lack the Nomi-

not in good use. 
HETEROCLITES 
145. A few nouns, called Heteroclites (heteroclita)' are partly 
of one declension and partly of another. 
1. Of the Second and Fourth Declensions are a few nouns in us: @omus, 
house ; laurus, laurel tree, etc. ; see 183, 1 and 2. 
2. Of the Second and Third Declensions are iiigerum, an acre, generally 
of the Second Declension in the singular, and of the Third in the plural: 
ifigerum, iiigeri; plural, iiigera, iigerum: vas, a vessel, of the Third 
Declension in the singular, and of the Second in the plural: vas, vasis ; 
plural, vasa, vasGrum. 
Norse. — Plural names of Festivals in alia, as BacchAndlia, .Satur- 
nalia, regularly of the Third Declension, sometimes have the Genitive 
plural in Grum. Ancile, a shield, and a few other words, have the 
same peculiarity. 
8. Of the Third and Fifth Declensions are requiés, rest, not used in the 
plural or in the Dative singular, but having in the other oblique cases the 
forms both of the Third and of the Fifth Declension ; and famés, hunger, 
regularly of the Third Declension, but with famé in the Ablative. 
4. Many nouns of four syllables have one form in ia of the First Declen- 
sion, and one in iés of the Fifth Declension: lixuria, lixuriés, luxury ; 
materia, materiés, material. 
5. Many Verbal nouns have one form in us of the Fourth Declension, 
and one in um of the Second Declension: cénatus, c6natum, attempt; 
éventus, éventum, event. 
6. Many nouns have only one approved form in the best prose, but admit 
another in poetry and in post-Augustan writers: iuventiis (itis), youth ; 
poetic, iuventa (ae): senectiis (itis), old age; poetic, senecta (ae): 
paupertas (itis), poverty; poetic, pauperiés (é1). 
146. Many adjectives have two distinct forms, one in us, a, um, 
of the First and Second Declensions, and one in is and e, of the 
Third: hilarus and hilaris, joyful; exanimus and exanimis, lifeless.

HETEROGENEOUS NOUNS 
147. Heterogeneous (heterogenea’) Nouns are partly of one 
gender and partly of another. Thus: 
1. Some Masculines take in the plural an additional form of the neuter 
gender: iocus, m., jest; plural, ioci, m., ioca, n.: locus, m., place ; plural, 
loci, m., topics, loca, n., places. 
2. Some Feminines take in the plural an additional form of the neuter 
gender: carbasus, f., linen; plural, carbasi, f., carbasa, n.: margarita, 
f., pearl; plural, margaritae, f., margarita, n.: ostrea, f., oyster; plural, 
ostreae, f., ostrea, n. 
3. Some Neuters become masculine in the plural: caelum, n., heaven ; 
plural, caeli, m. 
4. Some Neuters generally become masculine, but sometimes remain 
neuter: frénum, n., bridle ; plural, fréni, m. ; féna, n.: rastrum, n., rake ; 
plural, rastri, m.; rastra, n. 
5. Some Neuters become feminine in the plural: epulum, n., feast; 
plural, epulae, f. . 
Norr.—Some heterogeneous nouns are also heteroclites, as epulum, 
epulae, just given. 
148. Some nouns of the Second Declension haye one form in 
us, masculine, and one in um, neuter: clipeus, clipeum, shield; 
commentarius, commentarium, commentary. 
COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES 
149. Adjectives have three forms, called the Positive, the Com- 
parative, and the Superlative: altus, altior, altissimus, high, higher, 
highest. ‘These forms denote different degrees of the quality ex- 
pressed by the adjective. 
150. The Latin, like the English, has two modes of comparison. 
I. Terminational Comparison — by endings. 
II. Adverbial Comparison—by the adverbs magis, more, and 
maximé, most.

larly compared by adding to the stem of the positive, stripped 
of its final vowel, the following

152. Irregular Superlatives. — Many adjectives with regular 
comparatives have irregular superlatives. Thus: 
1. Adjectives in er add rimus to this ending: 
acer, acrior, dcerrimus, sharp, sharper, sharpest 
asper, asperior, asperrimus, rough, rougher, roughest 
celer, celerior, celerrimus, swift, swifter, swiftest 
2. But note the following: 
dexter, right, on the right, dexterior, dextimus 
matirus, mature, matiirior, matirissimus, matirrimus 
3. Six adjectives in ilis add limus to the stem, stripped of its final 
vowel :3 
1The Latin has three different superlative suffixes: (1) mus, seen in sum- 
mus, highest; (2) timus, seen in ci-timus, nearest; op-timus, best; and 
(3) is-simus, the usual suffix, compounded of is, the weak form of the com- 
parat: suffix, ios, ior, ahd simus, of uncertain origin, but probably a new 
formation after the analogy of certain words in simus, as pes-simus, worst ; 
pli-rimus for *pli-simus, most; m&ximus for *mag-simus, greatest; vic6- 
simus, éwentieth; tricé-simus, thirtieth. 
2 The suffix rimus is from is, the comparative suffix, and mus, imus, the 
superlative suffix: *acr-is-imus, which becomes *Aacer-s-imus, &cer-rimus; fF is 
yoealized, er; iis dropped and s is assimilated to the preceding r; see 54, 2. 
8 The suffix limus, like rimus, is from is-imus: *facil-is-imus, *facil-s-imus, 
facil-limus, s assimilated to a preceding 1; see 54, 2.

157. Many adjectives lack the Superlative: 
1. Many verbals in ilis and bilis: 
agilis, agilior, = agile, more agile 
docilis, docilior, - docile, more docile 
laudabilis,  laudabilior, => laudable, ‘more laudable 
optabilis, optabilior, = desirable, more desirable 
2. A few special adjectives: 
alacer, alacrior, -, active, more active 
diiiturnus, _diiiturnior, - lasting, more lasting 
longinquus, longinquior, -, distant, more distant 
proclivis, proclivior, -, prone, more prone 
pronus, pronior, = inclined, more inclined 
propinquus, propinquior _-, near, nearer 
salitaris, saliitarior, = salutary, more salutary 
  
1 N&tidnés exterae, foreign peoples, occurs in classical prose. 
2 Omnia supera, infera, all things above and below; and ad superés, to 
those above, and ad infer6s, to those below, occur in classical prose. 
8 Posterus occurs in a few expressions of time, poster dié, on the following 
day; in posterum diem, for the next day; in posterum, for the future. 
Note also posteri, descendants. 
4 Postumus means late born, or last born. 
5 The comparative of novus is supplied by recentior, from recéns, and the 
superlative, in the sense of newest, by recentissimus. 
6 The comparative of sacer is supplied by sanctior, from sanctus, and that 
of vetus by vetustior, from vetustus.
-P-A-G-E-76
60 MORPHOLOGY 
158. Three adjectives supply the Superlative as follows: 
aduléscéns, aduléscentior, minimus nati, young, younger, youngest 
iuvenis, itinior, minimus nati, young, younger, youngest 
senex, senior, maximus nati, old, older, oldest 
II. Adverbial Comparison—by the Adverbs magis and maximé 
159. Most adjectives in eus, ius, and uus, except those in quus, 
are compared by prefixing to the positive the adverbs magis, 
more, and maximé, most : 
iddneus, magis iddneus, maximé iddneus,! 
suitable more suitable - most suitable 
necessarius, magis necessarius, maximé necessirius, 
necessary more necessary most necessary 
arduus, magis arduus, maximé arduus, 
arduous more arduous most arduous 
1. Other adverbs are sometimes used with the positive to denote differ- 
ent degrees of the quality: admodum, valdé, oppid6, very; imprimis, 
or in primis, apprimé, in the highest degree. Per and prae in composition 
with adjectives have the force of very; perdifficilis, very dificult; prae- 
clarus, very illustrious. 
2. Strengthening particles are also sometimes used: with the com- 
parative etiam, even, mult6, longé, much, far; etiam diligentior, even 
more diligent; mult6 diligentior, much more diligent: with the .su- 
perlative mult6, longé, much, by far, quam, as possible: multé or longé 
diligentissimus, by far the most diligent; quam diligentissimus, as 
diligent as possible, 
ADJECTIVES WITHOUT COMPARISON 
160. Many adjectives, from the nature of their signification, 
are rarely, if ever, compared, especially such as denote Material, 
Color, Possession, or the relations of Time and Place: 
aureus, golden ferreus, of iron albus, white 
flavus, yellow maternus, of a mother paternus, of a father 
Roémanus, Roman aestivus, of summer sempiternus, eternal 
  
1 Observe that this adverbial comparison by means of magis and maxims 
corresponds exactly to the English adverbial comparison by means of more 
and most.

NUMERALS 
161. Numerals comprise Numeral Adjectives and Numeral 
Adverbs. 
162. Numeral Adjectives comprise three principal classes : 
1. Cardinal Numbers: tnus, one; duo, two; trés, three. 
2. Ordinal Numbers: primus, jist; secundus, second ; tertius, 
third. 
3. Distributives: singuli, one by one; bini, two by two, two each, 
two apiece. 
Norr. —To these may be added 
1. Multiplicatives, adjectives in plex, Gen. plicis, denoting so many 
fold: simplex, single; duplex, double; triplex, threefold ; quadruplex, 
fourfold. 
2. Proportionals, declined like bonus, and denoting so many times as 
great: duplus, twice as great; triplus, three times as great.

1 Literally two from twenty, one from twenty, by subtraction; but these 
numbers may be expressed by addition: decem et octd; decem et novem 
or decem novem: so 28, 29; 38, 39, etc., either by subtraction from triginta, 
ete., or by addition to viginti, etc. 
2 Sometimes expressed by addition: octaévus decimus ; nénus decimus. 
8 Sometimes oct6ni déni; novéni déni. 
4 If tens precede the units, et is omitted, otherwise it is generally used. So in 
English cardinals, twenty-one, one and twenty. 
5 Sometimes Vic6ni et singuli or singuli vicéni. 
6 In compounding numbers above 100, units generally follow tens, tens hundreds 
etc., as in English; but the connective et is either omitted, or used only between 
the two highest denominations: mille centum viginti or mille et centum 
viginti, 1120. 
7 Often written millia, For duo milia, bina milia or bis mille is sometimes 
used. 
8 Literally, ten times a hundred thousand; the table might be carried up to 
any desired number by using the proper numeral adverb with centéna milia: 
centiés centéna milia, 10,000,000; sometimes in suth combinations centéna 
milia is understood, and the adverb only is expressed, and sometimes centura 
Milia is used, 
     
-P-A-G-E-79
  
NUMERAL ADJECTIVES 63 
1. Poets use numeral adverbs (171) very freely in compounding numbers: 
bis sex, for duodecim; bis septem, for quattuordecim. 
2. S€scenti and mille, and in poetry centum, are sometimes used indefi- 
nitely for any large number, as thousand is used in English. 
164. Distributives are used. 
1. To show the Number of objects taken at a time, often best rendered 
by adding to the cardinal each or apiece: ternos dénarios accépérunt,, © 
they received each three denarii, or three apiece. Hence 
2. To express Multiplication: deciés centéna milia, ten times a hun- 
dred thousand, a million. 
8. Instead of Cardinals, with nouns plural in form, but singular in sense: 
bina castra, two camps. Here for singuli and terni, ini and trini are 
used: iinae litterae, one letter ; trinae litterae, three letters. 
4. Sometimes of objects spoken of in pairs: bini scyphi, a pair of gob- 
lets ; and in the poets with the force of cardinals: bina hastilia, two spears. 
165. In fractions the numerator is expressed by cardinals and the 
denominator by ordinals, with or without pars, as in English: duae 
tertiae, two thirds = 3; trés quintae, three jifths = $; trés septimae, 
three sevenths = }. 
1. When the numerator is omitted, it is always one. Then pars is gener- 
ally expressed: tertia pars, one third part =}; quarta pars, one fourth 
part =}. 
2. When the denominator is omitted, it is always larger than the numera- 
tor by one. Here partés is expressed: duae partés, two thirds = 3; trés 
partés, three fourths = 3. 
Declension of Numeral Adjectives

1. The plural of inus in the sense of alone may be used with any noun: 
fini Ubil, the Ubii alone; but in the sense of one, it is used only with nouns 
plural in form, but singular in sense: tina castra, one camp; tnae litterae, 
one letter. 
2. Like duo is declined amb6, both. 
8. Multi, many, and pliirimi, very many, are indefinite numerals, and as 
such generally want tlie singular. But’ in the poets the singular occurs in the 
sense of many a: multa hostia, many a victin. 
167. The Cardinals from quattuor to centum are indeclinable, but 
hundreds are declined like-the plural of bonus: ducentt; ae, a: 
168. Mille as an adjective is indeclinable; as a substantive it is used 
in the singular in the Nominative and Accusative, but in the plural it is 
declined like the plural of cubile (108): milia, milium, milibus. 
1. With the substantive mille, milia,.the name of the objects enumerated 
is generally in the Genitive: mille hominum, « thousand men (of men) ; but 
if a declined numeral intervenes it takes the case of that numeral: tria milia 
trecenti milités, three thousand three hundred soldiers. 
169. Ordinals are declined like bonus, and distributives’ like the 
plural of bonus, but the latter often have um instead of Grum in the 
Genitive: binum for binérum.

1In adverbs formed from cardinal numbers, iés is the approved ending, though 
iéns often occurs. In adverbs from indefinite numeral adjectives, iéns is the 
approved ending: totiéns, from tot, so often; Quotiéns, from quot, how often.

2. Numeral adverbs are often combined with Distributives: bis bina, 
twice two ; virginés ter novénae, three choirs of nine maidens each. 
3. For the poetic use of these adverbs with Cardinals, as bis sex for 
duodecim, see 163, 1. 
4, Another class of adverbs, with the ending um or 6, is formed chiefly 
from Ordinals: primum, prim6, for the jirst time, in the first place; ter- 
tium, in the third place; postrémum, postrém6, in the last place; but 
prim6 often means at first, in the beginning, in distinction from primum, 
in the first place, and postrém6 often means at last, in the end, in distinc- 
tion from postrémum, in the last place, lastly. 
PRONOUNS 
172. In construction, Pronouns! are used either as Substan- 
tives: ego, I; ta, thou; is, he; or as Adjectives: meus, my; 
tuus, your suus, his, her, their. 
    
  173. Pronouns are divided into seven classes: 
1. Personal and Reflexive Pronouns: ti, thou; sui, of himself. 
2. Pessessive Pronouns: meus, my. 
3. Demonstrative Pronouns: hic, this ; ille, that. 
4. Determinative Pronouns: is, he, that. 
5. Relative Pronouns: qui, who. 
6. Interrogative Pronouns: quis, who ? 
7. Indefinite Pronouns: aliquis, some one. 
I. PERSONAL AND REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS 
174. Personal Pronouns,’ so called because they designate the 
person ofthe noun which they represent, sometimes refer back 
to the subject of the sentence, and thus have a reflexive use: 
puer sé amat, the boy loves himself; sé amant, they love themselves ; 
té amas, you love yourself. 
  
1 But in their signification and use, pronouns differ widely from ordinary sub-- 
stantives and adjectives, as they never name any object, action, or quality, but 
simply point out the relation of some object or action to the speaker, or to some 
other person or thing. 
2 Also called Substantive Pronouns, because they are always used substan- 
tively.

Acc. nds, us vos, you 86, themselves 
Abl. ndbis, with, by us vobis, with, by you sé, with, by themselves 
1. Mi is often used for mihi in poetry, and sometimes in prose. 
2. Nostrum and vestrum are generally used in a Partitive sense, as 
quis nostrum, who of us ? but nostri and vestri are generally used in an 
Objective sense, as memor vestri, mindful of you. 
8. Observe that the case endings of pronouns differ considerably from 
those of nouns. 
4, Emphatic Forms.— Tiite and tiitemet for the Nom. ti. All the 
other cases of personal pronouns, except the Genitive plural, have emphatic 
forms in met: egomet, J myself; témet, you yourself. 
5. The Reduplicated Forms mémé, tété, and sésé occur both in the 
Accusative and in the Ablative. 
6. Ancient and Rare Forms are mis for mei; tis for tul; méd, téd, 
séd for mé, té, sé, both Accusative and Ablative. Forms in pte as mépte 
and sépte are especially rare. In early Latin poetry, nostr6rum and 
  
1 Ego has no connection in form with mei, mihi, etc., but it is identical, both 
in form and meaning, with the corresponding Greek pronoun. 
2 Ti and vos, as Vocatives, though recognized by certain Roman grammarians, 
are of doubtful authority. All other pronouns, except the possessives, meus and 
noster, lack the Vocative. 
8 The Ablative generally takes a preposition, as cum, with, &, ab, by. 
4Vestrum and vestri are also written vostrum and vostri, though less 
correctly. Mei, tui, sui, nostri, and vestri are in form strictly Possessives in 
the Genitive singular, but by use they have become Personal. Nostri and vestri 
have also become plural. Thus, memor vestri, mindful of you, means literally 
mindful of yours, i.e. of your welfare, interest. Nostrum and vestrum, for 
nostrérum and vestrérum, are also Possessives; see 176.
-P-A-G-E-84
68 MORPHOLOGY 
nostrarum sometimes occur for nostrum ; and vostrum, vostrSrum, and 
vostrarum, for vestrum. 
7. Cum, when used with the ablative of a personal pronoun, is appended 
to it: mécum, with me; técum, with you. 
II. POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS 
176. From Personal Pronouns are formed the Possessives: 
meus, mea, meum, my ; noster, nostra, nostrum, our; 
tuus, tua, tuum, thy, your; vester, vestra, vestrum, your ; 
suus, sua, suum, his, her, its; suus, sua, suum, their. 
1. Possessives are adjectives of the First and Second Declensions; but 
meus has in the Vocative singular masculine generally mi, sometimes 
meus, and in the Genitive plural sometimes meum instead of medrum. 
2. Emphatic forms in pte occur in the Ablative singular: sudpte, 
suapte; forms in met are rare: suamet. 
3. The possessive cilius, ciiia, ciiium,! early form quéius, qudia, 
qudium, whose ? whose ; generally interrogative, is rare, but it occurs in the 
Nominative singular and in a few other isolated forms. 
4. A few forms of the possessives, ciiias, of whose country? and 
nostras, of our country, declined like aetas, aetatis, occasionally occur. 
II DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 
177. Demonstrative Pronouns, so called because they point out 
the objects to which they refer, are the following: 
Hie, this, near me. 
Iste, that, near you. 
Ille, that, near him, that yonder, 
178. The Demonstrative Pronouns hic and iste are declined 
as follows, and ille is declined precisely like iste : 
Hie, this. Iste, that.

1. Haec, for hae, feminine plural, is freely used in Plautus and Terence, 
and sometimes in classical prose. 
2. The stems of hic, haec, hdc are ho, ha, strengthened in certain forms 
by the addition of another pronominal stem, i, and of the demonstrative 
particle ce, generally reduced to c. 
8. The demonstrative enclitic ce may be appended to any form in s: 
hiiius-ce, hds-ce, has-ce, his-ce. 
4, If the interrogative ne is appended to a form originally ending in ce, 
the result is generally cine, sometimes cne: hici-ne, hic-ne. 
5. The stems of iste, ista, istud are isto, ista, and those of ille, illa, 
illud are illo, illa. 
6. In early Latin ce, generally shortened to ce, is sometimes appended ta

eum, behold him ; eccds for ecce eds, behold them. 
8. Kindred to demonstrative pronouns are the following adjectives: 
talis, e, such; tantus, a, um, so great; tot, so many. Tot is indeclinable, 
the rest regular. 
9. For talis, the Genitive of a demonstrative with modi, the Genitive of 
modus, measure, kind, is often used: hiiius modi or hiiius-modi, of this 
kind, such. In origin, hiiusmodi is simply a limiting Genitive, but it has 
become practically an indeclinable adjective. 
179. Special Pronominal Endings. —'The declension of pronouns, in 
distinction from nouns, shows the following 
Special Pronominal Endings 
ius, in the Genitive singular: hiius, istius, illius.1 
i, in the Dative singular: isti, illt. 
d, in the neuter singular of the Nominative and Accusative: id, istud, 
illud. 
IV. DETERMINATIVE PRONOUNS 
180. Determinative Pronouns specify the objects to which they 
refer. They are: 
Is, ea, id; he, she, it, that one, that. 
Ipse, ipsa, ipsum; he himself, she herself, itself, self. 
Idem, eadem, idem; the same, same. 
181. The Determinative Pronouns are declined as follows: 
Is, he.” Ipse, self. SincuLar

Abl. ed ea e} ipsd ipsa ipso 
  
1In the ending ius, observe that i is a consonant when it follows a vowel, as 
in hiius, but a vowel when it follows a consonant, as in is-ti-us, 
2 The stem of is, ea, id appears in three different forms, i, eo, e&. 
8 The stem of ipse for ipsus is ipso, ipsa, but forms of ipse occur in which 
the first element, the demonstrative stem i, is declined, while pse is treated as

Idem, formed by appending dem to the pronoun is, the same,

and iddem to idem, and m is changed to n before 4; see 55, 5.

eis, is, and ibus for the Dative and Ablative iis.1 
Of idem: eidem and iidem for the Nominative plural idem, and eisdem 
and iisdem for the Dative and Ablative isdem,? 
V. RELATIVE PRONOUNS 
182. The Relative qui, who, so called because it relates to some 
noun or pronoun, expressed or understood, called its antecedent, 
is declined as follows :* 
  
an indeclinable particle: eum-pse = ipsum; eam-pse = ipsam, etc.; sometimes 
combined with ré; ré&pse = ré eapse = ré ipsa, in reality. Ipsus for ipse is not 
uncommon. 
1 Other ancient and rare forms occur. 
2%n early Latin, eisdem and isdem occur for idem in both numbers, and 
eidem and idem for idem. 
8 The relative qui, the interrogative quis, qui, and the indefinite quis, qui, 
are all formed from the same three stems, qui, quo, qua, seen in qui-s, quo-d, 
qua. Qui is for quo-i. 
Ancient and rare forms of qui are quei for Nom. sing. qui; quis, quid, for 
qui, quae, quod; qudius for ctiius; quoi for cui; qués, quei, for Nom. pl. 
qui; queis, quis, for quibus; and qui for qué, qua, quibus,

1. Qui? = qu6, qua, and quibus, with whom, with which, wherewith, 
is a Locative of the relative qui. 
2. Cum, when used with the Ablative of the relative is generally appended 
to it: quibus-cum. 
3. Quicumque and quisquis, whoever, are called from their signification 
General Relatives.2 Quicumque is declined like qui, but its parts are some- 
times separated by one or more words: qua ré cumque for quacumque ré. 
Quisquis is rare except in the forms quisquis, quicquid,t quéqu6é. 
4. Relative Adjectives are: qualis, quale, such as; quantus, a, um, 
so great; quot, as many as; quotus, a, um, of which number; and the 
double and compound forms, qalisqualis, qualiscumque, etc. Quot 
is indeclinable, 
VI. INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS 
183. The Interrogative Pronouns are used in asking questions. 
They are the following, with their compounds: 
Mase. Fem. Neut. 
1. Quis, — quid who? what? used as a substantive. 
2. Qui, quae, quod which? what? what kind of ? used as an 
adjective. 
3. Uter, utra, utrum which (of two persons)? what or which (of 
two things) ?’used both as a substantive 
and as an adjective. 
1 An Accusative quom, also written cum, formed directly from the stem quo, 
became the conjunction quom, cum, when, lit. during which, i.e. during which 
time. Indeed, several other conjunctions, as quam, quamquam, are in their 
origin Accusatives of pronouns. 
2 Compare this with the interrogative qui, how? why? (184, 4). 
8 Relative pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs may be made general in significa- 
tion by taking cumque. like qui-cumque, or by being doubled, like quis-quis ; 
qualis-cumque, qu@lis-qualis, of whatever kind; ubi-cumque, ubi-ubi, 
wheresoever. 
4The form quidquid seems to be without good authority.   
-P-A-G-E-89

184. Quis,! quid? used in the singular, is*declined as follows:

Dat. cui cui Sor whom Sor what 
Acc. quem quid whom what

1. Qui,! quae, quod? which ? what kind of ? used as an adjective, is 
declined like the relative qui, quae, quod. 
2. Uter, utra, utrum? which or what of two persons or things? has 
already been given; see 93. 
83. Quis is sometimes used as an adjective, and qui sometimes as a sub- 
stantive, especially in dependent clauses. 
4. Qui, a Locative, used chiefly as an adverb, meaning how ? by what 
means ? occurs in special expressions, as qui scis ? how do you know ? qui 
tit ? how does it happen ? and in the interrogative quin = qui-ne, why not ? 
5. Strengthened forms of quis and qui are declined like the simple pro- 
nouns quis and qui: 
  Quis-nam, _ quid-nam who indeed? what indeed? asa substantive. 
Qui-nam, quae-nam, quod-nam of what kind indeed ? as an adjective. 
6. Note the Interrogative Adjectives: qualis, e, of what kind ? quantus, 
a, um, how great ? quot, how many ? quotus, a, um, of what number ? 
VII. INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 
185. Indefinite Pronouns do not refer to any definite persons 
or things. The most important are quis and qui, with their com- 
pounds or derivatives. 
186. Quis, any one, and qui, any one, any, are nearly the same 
in form and declension as the interrogatives quis and qui; but 
they are used chiefly after si, nisi, né, and num, and in relative 
clauses, and they have quae or qua in the feminine singular and 
neuter plural: si quae, si qua. 
187. From quis and qui are formed various other indefinite 
pronouns and Ee adjectives, to which @llus may be

same as those of the relative qui.

added. These may be divided according to their meaning as 
follows: 
1. Some one, any one, some, any; something, anything: 
Substantive Adjective 
ali-quis! ali-quid ali-qui ali-qua ali-quod 
quis-piam. quid-piam 2 quis-piam quae-piam quod-piam ? 
quis-quam quic-quam tlus illa tllum 
Nore 1.—Aliquis and quispiam are occasionally used as adjectives, 
and aliqui occasionally as a substantive. Aliquis and aliqui have aliqua 
in the neuter plural. 
Nore 2.—Ullus is the adjective corresponding to quisquam, of which it 
supplies the plural and sometimes the oblique cases of the singular. 
2. Any one you please, anything you please; any whatever: 
Substantive Adjective 
qui-vis quae-vis quid-vis qui-vis quae-vis quod-vis 
qui-libet quae-libet  quid-libet qui-libet  quae-libet  quod-libet 
  3. A certain one, a certain thing, certain: 
Substantive Adjective 
qui-dam quae-dam quid-dam qui-dam quae-dam quod-dam 
Norr.—In quidam, as in Idem, m is changed to n before d: quen- 
dam, quan-dam ; quérun-dam, quarun-dam. 
4. Every one, every thing, every, each: 
Substantive Adjective 
quis-que quid-que quis-que  quae-que = quod-que 
188. The following words, with which we-are already familiar, are 
called Pronominal Adjectives; see 93: 
alius, alter ; uter, neuter ; illus, niillus.. 
another, the other; which? neither ; any, not any. 
1. Niillus, no one, not any, no, supplies certain cases of némG, no one, 
and with rés, also of nihil, nothing: 
  
1 Aliquis is formed from quis by prefixing ali, seen in ali-us; quis-piam 
and quis-quam from quis by annexing piam and quam, 
2 Also written quippiam and quoppiam, 
8 The form quidquam seems to be without good authority.

= some ; nescid quot = aliquot, some, a certain number. 
  
1QObserve that the question quis or qui, who or what? may be answered 
indefinitely by quis, qui, aliquis, etc., or definitely by a demonstrative, either 
alone or with a relative, as by hic, this one, or hic qui, this one who; is, he, or 
is qui, he who, ete. 
2In form observe that the indefinite is either the same as the interrogative or 
is a compound of it: quis, ali-quis, qui, qui-dam, and that the relative is 
usually the same as the interrogative. 
8 On hic, iste, illo, and is, see 178, 181.

  76 MORPHOLOGY 
VERBS 
190. Verbs in Latin, as in English, express existence, condition, 
or action: est, he is; dormit, he is sleeping; legit, he reails. 
1. Transitive Verbs admit a direct object of the action: servum verbe- 
rat, he beats the slave. 
2. Intransitive Verbs do not admit such an object: puer currit, the boy 
runs. 
3. Some verbs may be used either with or without an. object, i.e. either 
transitively or intransitively. 
4. Verbs have Voice, Mood, Tense, Number, and Person. 
I. VOICES 
191. The Active Voice represents the subject as acting or 
existing: 
Pater filium amat, the father loves his son; est, he is. 
192. The Passive Voice represents the subject as acted upon 
by some other person or thing: 
Filius 4 patre amatur, the son is loved by his father. 
1. Intransitive Verbs generally have only the active voice, but are some- 
times used impersonally in the passive; see 802, 6. 
2. Deponent Verbs! are passive in form, but not in sense: loquor, 7 
speak. But see 222. 
II. MOODS 
193. The Indicative Mood represents the action of the verb as 
a Fact. It may assert or assume a fact, or it may inquire after 
the fact: 
Legit, he is reading. Si legit, if he is reading. Legitne, is he reading? 
194. The Subjunctive Mood in general represents the action of 
the verb simply as Possible, as Desired, or as Conceived: 
Amémus patriam, let us love our country. Forsitan quaeratis, perhaps 
you may inquire.* 
  
1$o called from dép6nd, T lay aside, as they dispense, in general, with the 
active form and the passive meaning. 
. ? But the use and proper translation of the Subjunctive must be learned from 
the Syntax.
-P-A-G-E-93
  
VERBS 17 
195. The Imperative Mood is used in Commands and En- 
treaties : 
Valétiidinem tuam cur, take care of your health. 
Ill TENSES 
196. There are six tenses, three for Incomplete Action and 
three for Completed Action: 
1. Tenses for Incomplete Action: 
Present : am6, J love, I am loving, I do love. 
Imperfect : amabam, I was loving, I loved. 
Future: amabé, I shall love. 
2. Tenses for Completed Action: 
Perfect: amAavi, I have loved, I loved. 
Pluperfect : amaveram, I had loved. 
Future Perfect: amAaver6, J shall have loved. 
Norn 1.—'The Indicative Mood has the six tenses; the Subjunctive has 
the Present, Imperfect, Perfect, and Pluperfect ; the Imperative, the Present 
and Future only. 
197. The Latin Perfect, unlike the English, has a twofold use: 
1. It sometimes corresponds to our Perfect with have — they have loved. 
It is then called the Present Perfect, or Perfect Definite. 
2. It sometimes corresponds to our Imperfect, or Past tense — they loved. 
It is then called the Historical Perfect, or Perfect Indefinite. 
198. Principal and Historical. — Tenses are also distinguished as 
1. Principal or Primary Tenses : 
Present: am6, J love. 
Present Perfect: amavi, I have loved.) 
Future: amabé, I shall love. 
Future Perfect: amAaverd, J shall have loved. 
2. Historical or Secondary Tenses : 
Imperfect : amabam, I was loving. 
Historical Perfect: amavi, J loved.1 
Pluperfect: amaveram, J had loved. 
  
1 Thus the Latin Perfect combines within itself the force and use of two dis- 
tinct tenses—the Perfect proper, seen in the Greek Perfect, and the Aorist, seen
-P-A-G-E-94
  78 MORPHOLOGY 
199. Verbs have two numbers, Singular and Plural, and three 
persons, First, Second, and Third. 
1. The various verbal forms which have voice, mood, tense, number, and — 
person, make up the Finite Verb. 
200. Among verbal forms are included the following verbal 
nouns and adjectives: 
1. The Infinitive is a verbal noun: 12 
Exire ex urbe vol6, I wish to go out of the city. 
2. The Gerund gives the meaning of the verb in the form of a verbal noun 
of the Second Declension, used only in the Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and 
Ablative singular. It corresponds to the English verbal noun in ing: 
Ars vivendi, the art of living. Ad discendum pr6pénsus, inclined to 
learning. 
8. The Supine gives the meaning of the verb in the form of a verbal noun 
of the Fourth Declension. It has a form in um and a form in a: 
Auxilium postulatum vénit, he came to ask aid. Difficile dictii est, 
it is difficult to tell. 
4, The Participle in Latin, as in English, gives the meaning of the verb 
in the form of an adjective.2_ A verb may have four participles, —two in the 
Active, the Present and the Future, and two in the Passive, the Perfect and 
the Gerundive*®: 
Active, Present and Future: amans, loving; amatirus, about to 
love. 
Passive, Perfect and Gerundive: améatus, loved; amandus, deserving 
to be loved. 
  
in the Greek Aorist: am&vi= rep{Anna, I have loved ; amAvi= égirnca, I loved. 
The Historical Perfect and the Imperfect both represent the action as past, but 
the former regards it simply as a historical fact—JI loved; while the latter 
regards it as in progress—J was loving. 
1 The Infinitive has the characteristics both of verbs and of nouns. As a verb, 
it governs oblique cases and takes adverbial modifiers; as a noun, it is itself 
governed. In origin, it is a verbal noun in the Dative or Locative. In the 
example observe that the Infinitive exire is translated by the English Infinitive, 
to go out. 
2 Participles are verbs in force, but adjectives in form and inflection. As 
verbs, they govern oblique cases; as adjectives, they agree with nouns. Parti- 
ziples are sometimes best translated by English Participles and sometimes by 
Clauses. 
8 Sometimes called the Future Passive Participle.

CONJUGATION 
201. Regular verbs are inflected, or conjugated, in four differ- 
ent ways, and are accordingly divided into Four Conjugations,’ 
distinguished from each other by the stem characteristics or by 
the endings of the Infinitive, as follows: 
Characteristics Infinitive Endings 
Cong. I. a are 
IL. 6 6-re 
. II. e ere 
IV. a Tre 
202. Principal Parts. —The Present Indicative, Present Infini- 
tive, Perfect Indicative, and Supine, or the Neuter of the Perfect 
Participle,’ are called from their importance the Principal Parts 
of the verb. 
1. In verbs which lack both the Supine and the Perfect Participle, the 
Future Participle may serve as one of the Principal Parts. 
203. The Principal Parts are the stem forms of the verb, as 
they contain the three stems which form the basis of all verbal 
inflections, viz. : 
  1. The verb stem, which remains unchanged in all the various 
forms of both voices of the verb. 
2. Two special stems,’ the Present Stem, often identical with 
the verb stem, found in the Present Indicative, and the Perfect 
Stem, found in the Perfect Indicative. 
204. The entire conjugation of any regular verb may be readily 
formed from the principal parts by means of the proper endings.’ 
1. Sum, J am, is used as an auxiliary in the passive voice of regular 
verbs. Accordingly, its conjugation must be given at the outset. 
  
1 The Four Conjugations are only varieties of one general system of inflection. 
2 The masculine form of the participle, sometimes treated as one of the Prin- 
cipal Parts, is unfortunately found only in transitive verbs, while the form here 
adopted covers nearly two hundred and fifty Supines and all Perfect Participles 
whether used personally or impersonally. 
8 For the treatment of stems, see 246-253. 
4In the paradigms of, regular verbs the endings which distinguish the various 
forms are separately indicated, and should be carefully noticed. In the parts de- 
rived from the present stem (233) each ending contains the characteristic vowel.

1 The forms of irregular verbs are often derived from different roots. Thus in 
English, am, was, been; yo, went, gone. 
2 Observe that the stem es has two forms, es, seen in es-se, es-t, es-tis, and 
in er-am, for es-am (50), and a weak form, 8, seen in S-um, S-umus, s-unt. 
8 Observe that the endings which are added to the stems es and fu are dis- 
tinguished by the type. 
4 Or, you will be, you have been, you had been, you will have been. The use of 
thou is confined chiefly to solemn discourse.

2. The Gerundive has the passive signification; sometimes, also, the 
Perfect Participle: hortandus, to be exhorted; expertus, tried. 
38. The Future Infinitive has the active form. 
223. Deponent verbs are found in each of the four conjuga- 
tions. Their principal parts are the Present Indicative, Present 
Infinitive, and Perfect Indicative :

SEMI-DEPONENT VERBS 
224. Semi-Deponent Verbs have active forms in the Present 
system and passive forms in the Perfect system : 
auded audére ausus sum to dare 
gauded gaudére gavisus sum to rejoice 
soled solére solitus sum. to be wont 
fidd fidere fisus sum to trust 
1. The Perfect Participles of a few Intransitive verbs have the active 
meaning, but they are generally used as adjectives: 
adultus, having grown up, adult, from adoléscere, to grow up 
cautus, taking care, cautious, “  cavére, to take care 
cénatus, having dined, s  cénare, to dine 
placitus, pleasing, *¢  placére, to please 
pransus, having breakfasted, “* prandére, to breakfast 
2. Dévertor, to turn aside, and revertor, to return, have active forms 
in the Perfect system, borrowed from dévert6 and reverts. 
I-VERBS OF THE THIRD CONJUGATION 
225. A few verbs of the Third Conjugation form the Present 
Indicative in id, like verbs of the Fourth Conjugation. They are 
inflected with the endings of the Fourth whenever those endings 
have two successive vowels. These verbs are: 
1. Capi6, to take; cupid, to desire; facid, to make; fodid, to dig, 
fugiG, to flee; iaciG, to throw; pariG, to bear; quatis, to shake; rapid, 
to seize ; sapiG, to be wise ; with their compounds.

229. Deponent verbs in ior of the Third Conjugation, like other de- 
ponent verbs, have in the active voice the Future Infinitive, the Parti- 
ciples, Gerund, and Supine, but lack the Future Infinitive of the passive 
form. They are otherwise inflected precisely like the passive of capior:

VERBAL INFLECTIONS 
230. The principal parts are regularly formed in the four con- 
jugations with the following endings: 
Cong. I. 5 are avi atum 
amo amare amavi amitum to love 
In a few verbs: ed ére évi étum 
nT déled délére délévi délétum to destroy 
In most verbs; eo ére ul itum 
moned monére monui monitum to advise 
In consonant stems: 6 ere si tum 
oT. carpd carpere carpsi carptum to pluck 
l In u-stems: ud uere ul aitum 
acud acuere acui aciitum to sharpen

  VERBAL INFLECTIONS 107 
231. Compounds of verbs with dissyllabic Supines or Perfect Parti- 
ciples} generally change the stem vowel in forming the principal parts.? 
1. When the simple verb has the stem vowel'e, which becomes 6, both 
in the Perfect and in the Participle, the compound generally changes 
e toi, but retains 6: 
rego regere réxi réctum to rule 
di-rigd di-rigere di-réxi di-réctum. to direct 
2. When the simple verb has the stem vowel e, which remains un- 
changed both in the Perfect and in the Participle, the compound gener- 
ally retains e in the Participle, but changes it to i in the other parts: 
tened tenére tenui tentum to hold 
dé-tined dé-tinére dé-tinui dé-tentum to detain 
3. When the simple verb has the stem vowel a, which becomes 6 in 
the Perfect, the compound generally retains é in the Perfect, but changes 
a to e in the Participle and to i in the other parts: 
capid capere cépi captum to take 
ac-cipio ac-cipere ac-cépi ac-ceptum to accept 
4. When the simple verb has the stem vowel a throughout, the com- 
pounds generally change a to e in the Participle and to i in the other 
parts: 
rapio Tapere rapui raptum to seize 
di-ripid di-ripere di-ripui di-reptum to tear asunder 
Nore. —For Reduplication in compounds, see 251, 4; other peculiarities 
of compounds will be noticed under the separate conjugations. 
232. All the forms of the regular verb arrange themselves in three 
distinct groups or systems. 
233. The Present System, with the Present Infinitive as its basis, 
comprises : 
1. The Present, Imperfect, and Future Indicative — Active and Passive. 
. The Present and Imperfect Subjunctive— Active and Passive. 
The Imperative — Active and Passive. 
. The Present Infinitive — Active and Passive. 
. The Present Participle. 
6. The Gerund and the Gerundive. oR ow 
  
1 The term Participle here used of one of the principal parts of the verb des- 
ignates the form in tum or sum, which is the basis of the Participial or Supine 
System ; see 235. 
2 This change took place at a very early date, in accordance with phonetic laws, 
under the influence of the initial accent of that period.
-P-A-G-E-124

Norr. — These parts are all formed from the Present stem, found in the 
Present Infinitive Active by dropping the ending re: amare, present stem 
ama; monére, moné; regere, rege, with ablaut form rego ; audire, audi. 
284. The Perfect System, with the Perfect Indicative Active as its 
basis, comprises in the active voice: 
1. The Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect Indicative. 
2. The Perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive. 
3. The Perfect Infinitive. 
Nore. — These parts are all formed from the Perfect stem, found in the 
Perfect Indicative Active, by dropping i: amavi, perfect stem amav ; monui, 
monu. 
235. The Participial System, with the neuter of the Perfect Parti- 
ciple or the Supine as its basis, comprises: 
1. The Future Active and the Perfect Passive Participle, the former of 
which with esse forms the Future Active Infinitive, while the latter with 
the proper parts of the auxiliary sum forms in the passive those tenses 
which in the active belong to the Perfect system. These Participles are 
both formed from the verb stem, the Future by adding tirus, which some- 
times becomes siirus, and the Perfect by adding tus, which sometimes 
becomes sus. 
2. The Supine in tum and ti, the former of which with iri forms the 
Future Infinitive Passive. The Supine is formed from the verb stem by 
adding the endings tum, tii, which sometimes become sum, si. 
PERIPHRASTIC CONJUGATIONS 
236. The Active Periphrastic Conjugation, formed by combining the 
Future Active Participle with the verb sum, is used of actions which are 
imminent, or about to take place: 
Amatirus sum, J am about'to love. 
InpicativE Moop

PECULIARITIES IN CONJUGATION 
238. Perfects in avi and évi and the tenses derived from them 
sometimes drop ve or vi before r or s*: 
amavisti 
amavisse 
amaverim 
amaverd amasti délévisti délésti 
amiasse délévisse délésse 
amarim déléverim délérim. 
amaro déléverd délérd 
  
1 According to another theory they drop v, and then the following vowel, e or i, 
disappears by contraction with the preceding vowel, 4 or 6.
-P-A-G-E-126
110 MORPHOLOGY 
1. Perfects in 6vi from nésc6, and from the compounds of moveé, 
together with the tenses derived from them, may also drop ve, or vi, 
before r or s?: 
novisti nosti noveris noris 
commovissem  commédssem 
2. Perfects in ivi and the tenses derived from them sometimes drop 
vi before s, and they may drop v in any situation except before the 
ending ére: 
audivisti audisti audivi audit 
audivisse audisse audivérunt, audiérunt 
3. Certain short forms from Perfects in si and xi, common in poetry, 
are probably an independent formation of an early date : 
scripsti = scripsisti dixti = dixisti 
scripstis = scripsistis dixem = dixissem 
289. The ending ére for érunt in the Perfect is common in Livy and 
the poets, but rare in Caesar and Cicero. In poetry erunt occurs. 
240. Re for ris in the ending of the second person of the passive is 
rare in the Present Indicative, but common in the other tenses. 
241. Dic, diic, fac, and fer, for dice, diice, face, and fere, are the Im- 
peratives of dic6, diicd, facid, and ferd, to say, lead, make, and bear. 
1. Dice, diice, and face occur in poetry. 
2. Compounds generally follow the usage of the simple verbs, but the com- 
pounds of facid with prepositions retain the final e: cén-ficid, cén-fice. 
8. Scid, J know, lacks the present imperative, and uses the future in its 
stead. 
242. Future and Perfect Infinitives often omit the auxiliary, esse: 
amatirum, for amatiirum esse; amatum, for amatum esse. 
243. Undus and undi, for endus and endi, occur as the endings of 
the Gerundive and Gerund of the Third and Fourth Conjugations, espe- 
cially after i: faciundus, from facid, to Tune dicundus, from dicé, 
to say. 
244. Ancient and Rare Forms, — Various, other forms, belonging in 
the main to the earlier Latin, occur in the poets, even of the classical 
period, and occasionally also in prose, to impart to the style an air of 
antiquity or solemnity. Thus, forms ii --»

scibam for sciébam. See Imperfect of eG, to go, 297. 
2. Ib6, bor, for iam, iar, in the Future of the Fourth Conjugation: ser- 
vib6 for serviam ; opperibor for opperiar. See Future of e6, 297. 
3. im for am or em, in the Present Subjunctive: edim, edis, etc., for 
edam, edas, etc.; duim (from dud, for do) for dem. In sim, velim, nédlim, 
mAalim (295), im is the common ending. 
4. Ass6, ss6, and sd, in the Future Perfect, and Assim, éssim, and 
sim, in the Perfect Subjunctive of the First, Second, and Third Conjugations: 
fax6 (facso) = fécerd; faxim = fécerim; ausim = ausus sim (from audeo). 
Rare examples are: levass6 = levaverd ; prohibéss6 = prohibuerd; capsd 
= céperd. 
5. min for tor, in the Future Imperative, Passive, and Deponent: arbi- 
tramin6 for arbitrator. 
6. ier for I, in the Present Passive Infinitive: am@rier for amari: vi- 
dérier for vidéri. 
FORMATION OF STEMS 
245. The Verb Stem, which is the basis of the entire conjuga- 
tion, consists of that part of the verb which is common to all the 
forms of both voices. The Special Stems are either identical 
with this stem or formed from it. 
I. Present Stem 
246. The Present Stem, found in the Present Infinitive Active 
by dropping re, is generally the same as the verb stem in the First 
and in the Fourth Conjugation, and sometimes in the Second. 
Thus, ama, délé, and audi are both Present stems and verb stems. 
247. The Present stem, when not the same as the verb stem, is 
formed from it by one of the following methods: 
1. By adding the Thematic Vowel, originally e, 0, usually written /y 
In Latin this vowel generally takes the form i, u1: 
reg6, Stem, reg; Present Stem, reg °/, ; rege becomes regi in regi-s, and 
rego becomes regu in regu-nt. 
2. By adding n with the thematic vowel: 
cernd, Stem, cer; Present Stem, cer-n°/,; to perceive 
temn6, ¥6 tem’; as “  tem-n*/,; to despise 
1 For this phonetic change, see 25, 1, 27, 1.  
-P-A-G-E-128
TRE eT ee ee ee eee 
112 MORPHOLOGY 
3. By inserting n and adding the fakes vowel: 
  frango, Stem, frag; Present Stem, frang °/g ; to break 
4. By adding t with the thematic vowel: 
plectd, Stem, plec ; Present Stem, plec-t °/y ; to braid 
5. By adding se with the thematic vowel : 
quiéscd, Stem, quié ; Present Stem, quié-sc °/ ; to rest 
6. By prefixing to the stem its initial consonant with i, and adding 
the thematic vowel: 
gign-ere ; Stem, gen; Present Stem, gi-gn-°/,!; to beget 
7. By adding 4, é, i, or i to the stem?: 
dom-are Stem, dom Present Stem, dom-a to tame 
vid-ére 16 wid 8 “  vid-é to see 
aper-ire ‘caper ss ‘© aper-I to uncover 
cap-ere toe cap’ cS ‘| cap-i to take 
II. Perfect Stem 
248. Vowel stems, except those in u, generally form the Per- 
fect stem by adding v°*: 
ama-re ama-vi Stem, ama Perfect Stem, amav to love 
délé-re délé-vi o-dele Cr “  délév to destroy 
audi-re  audi-vi “audi ey “  audiv to hear 
1. In verbs in ué, the Perfect stem is the same as the verb stem: 
acu-ere acu-i Stem, acu ee tem, acu to sharpen 
249. Many stems in 1, m, n, r, and a few others, together with 
most of the verbs of the second conjugation, form the Perfect 
stem by adding u*: 
al-ere al-ui Stem, al Perfect Stem, alu to nourish 
frem-ere frem-ui ‘“ frem co “ fremu to rage 
ten-ére  ten-ui vc ee s | ee2 bono) to hold 
ser-ere ser-ul <¢- Ser 224 « seru to connect 
doc-ere doc-ui “© doc E “docu to teach 
  
1 In the reduplicated forms gigne, gigno, the na gen takes the weak form gn. 
2JIn the first person of the Present Indicative active, the suffixes are 40, 60, 
io, and io. 
8 Perfects in Vi and ui were not inherited, but are new formations. Perfects in 
vi are of uncertain origin, but they may have been formed on the analogy of such 
Perfects as favi, lavi, f6vi, m6vi, vOvi, iGvi, in which v belonss to the verb 
stem, The ending ui is probably only a modification of vi. 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  PERFECT STEM 113 
250. Most mute stems form the Perfect stem by adding s?: 
carp-ere  carp-si Stem, carp Perfect Stem, carps to pluck 
reg-ere réxi=*rég-si ‘ reg 8 ss réx=*régs to rule * 
251. Reduplication.— A few consonant stems form the Perfect 
stem by reduplication, which consists in prefixing the initial con- 
sonant of the stem with the following vowel or with e: 
tend-ere  te-tend-i Stem,tend Perfect Stem, te-tend to stretch 
posc-ere po-pdsc-i “pose nS “*  po-pdsc to demand 
curr-ere —cu-curr-I ce Our ee “© cu-curr to run 
can-ere ce-cin-i omit se **  ce-cin to sing 
1. The vowel of the reduplication was originally e. In Latin it is assimi- 
lated to the vowel of the stem when that vowel is i, 0, cr u, as in didic-i, 
po-p6sc-i, cu-curr-i, but it is retained as e in all other situations. 
2. After the reduplication, a of the stem is weakened toi in open syllables, 
as in can-ere, ce-ci-ni, but in closed syllables it is weakened to e, as in 
fall-ere, fe-fel-li; see 24,1 and 2. Ae is weakened to I, as in caed-ere, 
ce-ci-di; see 32, 2. 
3. In yerbs beginning with sp or st, the reduplication retains both con- 
sonants, but the stem drops s: spond-ére, spo-pond-i, to promise ; sta-re, 
ste-t-i, to stand. 
4, Compounds generally drop the reduplication, but the compounds of 
dare,” to give; discere, to learn; pdscere, to demand, and stare, to stand, 
retain it: te-tendi, contendi; but de-di, circum-de-di; ste-ti, circum- 
ste-ti. 
252. A few consonant stems form the Perfect stem by length- 
ening the stem vowel: 
em-ere ém-i Stem, em Perfect Stem, 6m to buy 
ag-ere &g-i8 Ser ag, & Aes es to drive 
leg-ere lég-i ‘slag: se Seow to read 
vid-ére —-vid-i s6 Nid: sd ea vid. to see 
1. A few verbs retain the stem unchanged : 
vert-ere _vert-i Stem,vert Perfect Stem, vert to turn 
vis-ere vis-i Se 18. 6S Sses 0s to visit 
  
1 The Perfect in si is in its origin an inherited s-Aorist which has become one of 
the regular forms of the Latin Perfect. It corresponds to fhe S-Aorist of the 
Greek, Sanskrit, and other kindred tongues. 
2 The compounds of dare which are of the Third Conjugation change e into i 
in the reduplication: ad-de-re, ad-di-di, for *ad-de-di, to add. 
8 Observe that @ in ag-ere and i in its compounds, as in ab-ig-ere, ab-6g-i, 
are not only lengthened, but also changed to 6.

1i4 MORPHOLOGY 
PARTICIPIAL SYSTEM 
253. The Participial System has no common stem, but it is 
represented in the Principal Parts of the verb by the neuter of 
the Perfect Participle, or by the Supine, each of which is formed 
by adding tum to the verb stem:   
ama-re ama-tum to love 
doc-ére doc-tum to teach 
can-ere can-tum to sing 
audi-re audi-tum to hear 
1. In stems in d and t, the union of d-t and of t-t in the Supine and 
Participle produces, according to phonetic law, ss, regularly reduced to s 
after long syllables: 
laed-ere *laed-tum lae-sum to hurt 
vert-ere *vert-tum. ver-sum to turn 
2. A few stems, chiefly those in 1 and r, following the analogy of stems in 
d and t, add -sum in forming the Supine or Participle : 
fal-lere+ fal-sum to deceive 
curr-ere cur-sum? to.run 
VERBAL ENDINGS 
254. The Endings which are appended to the verb stem in the 
formation of the various parts of the finite verb distinguish the 
different Voices, Moods, Tenses, Numbers, and Persons. 
I. Personal Endings 
255. The personal endings, some of which appear to have been 
formed from ancient pronominal stems, distinguish Voice, Num- 
ber, and Person. They are in general as follows: 
Prrson ACTIVE PASSIVE Meranine 
Sing. First m, 6 TOL a 
Second. s ris thou, you 
Third t tur he, she, tt 
Plur. First mus mur we 
Second tis mini? you

II. Mood and Tense Signs 
256. The Mood and Tense Signs include that part of the 
several verbal forms which stands between the verb stem and 
the personal endings: s-i-mus, s-i-tis; ama-ba-mus, am@-bi-tis, audi- 
vi-mus, audi-vera-mus. 
1. The Subjunctive has a long vowel before the personal endings, as in 
s-I-mus, s-I-tis, mone-a-mus, but this vowel is shortened before final m, r, 
and t, and in the Perfect generally before mus and tis: audi-am, audi-at, 
amaver-imus, amaver-itis. 
2. The Indicative has no special mood sign, and the Imperative is dis. 
tinguished by the personal endings. 
8. The Future in the Third and Fourth Conjugations is in origin a Sub- 
junctive, but it has assumed the force of the Future Indicative. 
  
ciple, not otherwise used in Latin, but seen in the Greek (uevor), Amé&mini, 
. originally am&mini estis, means you are loved, as amiti estis means you have 
been loved. 
1 These peculiar endings have been produced by the union of two tenses 
originally distinct, the Perfect and the s-Aorist, both of which are preserved in 
the Greek and the Sanskrit. Fui-t and fui-mus are regular Perfect formations 
with the ordinary personal endings of the Latin verb, but fu-i has the ending i of 
uncertain origin, though it may have been derived from the Personal ending of 
the Middle Voice. Fu-is-ti, fu-is-tis, and fu-6r-unt are s-Aorist formations, but, 
fu-is-ti preserves in ti a modified form of the original personal ending of the 
Perfect. 
2 The ending mini is probably in origin an old Infinitive which has assumed 
the force of an Imperative, like the corresponding form in Homeric Greek. If so, 
it is to be distinguished from the same form used in other moods.

8 But di-mic@ is regular, and re-sonG has Perfect re-sonavi. 
4Tuvo has Fut. Part. iuvatirus; in compounds iitirus. 
5 This short vowel is explained by the fact that d6, dare, is formed directly 
from tke root d6, weak form da, without the suffix which gave rise to @ in other 
verbs of this conjugation; das, da, dans follow the analogy of other verbs in 
6, are. 2

Inceptive or IncuoativeE VERBS

2. Verbal Inceptives, formed from other verbs, generally wit 
inceptive meaning.

290. A few verbs which have special irregularities are called 
by way of preéminence Irregular or Anomalous Verbs. They are 
sum, edo, ferd, vold, fid, ed, qued, and their compounds. 
1. The inflection of sum has already been given (205). Most of its com- 
pounds — ab-sum, ad-sum, dé-sum, ob-sum, prae-sum, etc. —are inflected 
in the same way, but ab-sum has 4-ful, 4-futirus, and a Present Participle 
ab-séns, absent. Prae-sum has a Present Participle prae-séns, present. 
Pos-sum and pr6-sum require special treatment.

1In the Present Indicative and Imperative orior is inflected as a verb of the 
Third Conjugation: orior, oreris, oritur, ete.; orere; in the Imperfect Sub- 
junctive, it has both orerer, orer6ris, ctc., and orirer, oriréris, ete. So all. 
compounds of orior, except ad-orior, which has only forms of the On 
Conjugation. 
2 Inflected regularly through the different persons: poteram, poteras, pot- 
erat, etc. So in the other tenses: potul, potuisti, etc.

1. Possum forms its present system from a compound of pot (for potis, 
pote), able, and sum. Pot-sum becomes possum by assimilation, and pot. 
esse and pot-essem are shortened to posse and possem.! 
2. The parts of possum are sometimes used separately, and then potis, 
pote is indeclinable: potis sum, J am able; potis sumus, we are able, etc. 
8. Possum derives its Perfect, potui, and its Present Participle, poténs, 
from the verb potére, which has otherwise disappeared from the language. 
4. In rare instances passive forms occur in early Latin, as potestur = 
potest, poteratur = poterat, used with Passive Infinitives. 
292. Pro-sum prdd-esse pro-ful to profit 
Prd-sum is compounded of pré, pr6d, for, and sum. It retains d from 
prod, when the simple verb begins with e, but otherwise it is inflected 
like sum: z 
pré-sum, prod-es, prod-est, prd-sumus, prdd-estis, prd-sunt, ete. 
293. Edo edere édi ésum to eat

of latum. 
2. Compounds of ferd are conjugated like the simple verb, but in a few

1. Bo is a verb of the Fourth Conjugation, but it forms the Supine from 
the weak stem i, and is irregular in several parts of the present system. In 
the perfect system the regular classical forms are iI, ieram, ierG, etc., as

4. As an intransitive verb eG has no regular passive voice, but certain 
passive forms are used impersonally: itur, there is going; itum est, they 
have gone ; but iri, the Passive Infinitive, is used as an auxiliary in the Future 
Infinitive Passive of the regular conjugation: amatum iri, etc. 
5. Compounds of eG have the short form in the Perfect System and are 
conjugated as follows: 
  ab-ed abire abii abitum to go away 
ex-e6 exire exii exitum to go out 
Nore. —A few compounds occasionally have a future in iet, for ibit. 
6. Transitive Compounds of ed may be used in the passive voice, as 
ad-e6, adire, to approach; Passive ad-eor, adiris, aditur, etc. Passive 
forms are somewhat rare. 
7. Ambi6 (from ambi-ed), ambire, ambivi, ambitum, to solicit, is in-

taedet taedére taeduit, taesum est. it disgusts 
8. Participles are generally wanting, but a few occur, though with a some- 
what modified sense: 
From licet : licéns, free ; licitus, allowed. 
From paenitet: paeniténs, penitent; paenitendus, to be repented of. 
From pudet: pudéns, modest; pudendus, shameful. 
4. Gerunds are generally wanting, but occur in rare instances: paeni- 
tendum, pudend6. 
5. A few verbs, generally personal, admit the impersonal construction in 
certain senses : 
accédit, it is added 
constat, it is agreed 
contingit, it happens 
Gvenit, it happens 
patet, it is plain accidit, it happens 
praestat, it is better 
délectat, it delights 
interest, it interests 
placet, it pleases apparet, it is clear 
restat, i remains 
dolet, i¢ grieves 
iuvat, it delights 
6. In the Passive Voice intransitive verbs can be used only impersonally. 
The participle is then neuter: mihi créditur, it is credited to me, I am be- 
lieved ; créditum est, it was delieved ; curritur, there is running, people run ; 
pignatur, it is fought, they, we, etc., fight; vivitur, we, you, they live. 
7. The Passive Periphrastic Conjugation (287) is often used impersonally. 
The participle is then neuter: mihi scribendum est, I must write. 
  
1Mé miseret, I pity ; mé paenitet, I repent.

142 MORPHOLOGY 
PARTICLES 
303. The Latin has four parts of speech, sometimes called 
Particles: the Adverb, the Preposition, the Conjunction, and the 
Taterjection. 
ADVERBS 
304. The Adverb is the part of speech which is used to qualify 
verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs: celeriter currere, to run 
swiftly ; tam celer, so swift; tam celeriter, so swiftly. 
305. Adverbs may be divided into three general classes: 
1. Adverbs which were originally the case forms of nouns, adjectives, 
participles, and pronouns. 
2. Adverbs formed by means of suffixes no longer used in the regular 
declensions. 
3. Adverbs formed by the union of prepositions with case forms. 
306. Many adverbs were originally Accusatives, both in form and in 
meaning. 
1. Accusatives of Nouns: vicem, in turn; partim, partly. 
2. Here perhaps may be mentioned adverbs in tim and sim, probably 
formed originally from verbal nouns no longer in use: statim, steadily ;1 
raptim, hastily ; contemptim, contemptuously ; firtim, stealthily. These 
adverbs are sometimes explained as Accusatives, and sometimes as Instru- 
mental cases, 
8. Accusatives of Adjectives and Pronouns: multum, multa, much ; 
céterum, cétera, as to the rest; vérum, truly; facile, easily; saepius, 
oftener; bifariam = bifariam partem, in two parts; alias = alias vicés, 
otherwise ; tam, so much; quam, as much. 
307. Many adverbs were originally Ablatives.? 
1. Ablatives of Nouns: forte, by chance ; itire, rightly ; numer6, exactly ; 
sponte, willingly. 
  
1Thus statim may be formed from statis, which is no longer in use, because 
supplanted by statid. Subsequently it seems to have been associated with the 
verb st&-re, and perhaps some adverbs in tim were formed from verbs by 
analogy. But some adverbs in tim and sim are formed from adjectives: singu- 
latim, one by one. In time, doubtless, these endings came to be regarded simply 
as adverbial suffixes, and were used in forming new adverbs. 
2 The term Ablative, as applied in Latin, includes not only the Ablative proper, 
but ar forms originally Instrumental, and such Locatives as are not easily recog: 
nized.
-P-A-G-E-159
ADVERBS 143 
2. Ablatives of Adjectives and Participles: dextra, on the right; extra, 
on the outside; rax6, rarely; docté, learnedly ; doctissimé, most learn- 
edly; maximé, especially ; auspicat6, afler taking the auspices ; cOnsultd, 
after deliberating. 
3. Ablatives of Pronouns: ea, there, in that way; hac, here, in this 
way ; eaidem, in the same way. 
4. A few Pronominal Adverbs denote direction toward a place: e6, to 
that place; hc, hiic, to this place ; ill6, il6-c, to that place ; ist6, istd-c, 
to your place. These adverbs are probably either Datives or Ablatives. 
5, Here may be mentioned a few adverbs in im, in-c: illim, illin-c, from 
that place; interim, meanwhile ; often with de: in-de, thence; proin-de, 
hence. ‘These adverbs may be Instrumental Ablatives. 
808. Some Adverbs were originally Locatives, denoting the Place or 
Time in which anything is done. f 
1. Locatives of Nouns and Adjectives ini or €: heri, yesterday ; temperi, 
in time; vesperi, in the evening ; peregri, or peregré, in a foreign land. 
2. Locatives of Pronouns:* hic,! here; illic, istic, there; ibi, there; ubi, 
where ; sic, in this way, thus. 
309. Adverbs in tus and ter.2— Adverbs are also formed by means of 
the endings tus and ter, which are no longer used as case endings in the 
regular declensions: fundi-tus, from the foundation ; radici-tus, from the 
roots, utterly; Aivini-tus, by divine appointment, divinely ; forti-ter, bravely ; 
priiden-ter, prudently. 
1. The stem vowel before tus and ter becomes i, and consonant stems 
assume i, but ti is lost by dissimilation (56) before ter: priiden-ti-ter, 
priiden-ter. 
310. Some adverbs are formed by the union of case forms with 
prepositions, even with prepositions with which they are not otherwise 
used: ad-modum, to the full measure, fully; ex-templ6, immediately ; 
ant-ea, before, before that; inter-ea, in the meantime; post-e, afterward ; 
tantis-per, for so long a time. 
1. A very few adverbs are simply adverbial phrases or clauses whose 
words have become united in writing, as scilicet, from scire licet, certainly ; 
lit. it is permitted to know ; vidélicet, from vidére licet, clearly ; forsitan, 
from fors sit an, perhaps. 
311. Comparison.— Most adverbs are derived from adjectives, and 
are dependent upon them for their comparison. The comparative is the 
1 Here the Locative ending isi: hi-c, illi-c. 
2 Seen also in in-tus, within; in-ter, in the midst; sub-tus, sub-ter, below,
-P-A-G-E-160
  144 MORPHOLOGY 
Accusative neuter singular of the adjective, and tae superlative changes 
the ending us of the adjective into 6:1 
altus altior altissimus lofty 
alté altius altissimé loftily 
1. When the adjective is compared with magis and maximé, the adverb 
is compared in the same way: 
€gregius magis égregius maximé égregius excellent 
6gregié magis égregié maximé égregié excellently 
2. When the adjective is irregular, the adverb has the same irregularity : 
bonus melior optimus good 
bene melius. optimé well 
8. When the adjective is defective, the adverb is generally defective : 
_ déterior déterrimus worse 
_ déterius déterrimé worse 
novus — novissimus new 
nové _ novissimé newly 
4. A few adverbs not derived from adjectives are compared: 
dit dititius diititissimé Sor a long time 
saepe saepius saepissimé often 
satis satius — sufficiently 
niiper - ntiperrimé recently 
5. Most adverbs not derived from adjectives, as also those from adjectives 
incapable of comparison (160), are not compared: hic, here; nunc, now; 
vulgariter, commonly. 
6. Superlatives in 6 or um are used in afew adverbs: primé, primum, 
potissimum. 
PREPOSITIONS 
312. The Preposition is the part of speech which shows the relations 
of objects to each other: in Italia esse, to be in Italy; ante mé, before me. 
1. Prepositions were originally adverbs.2 
2. For Prepositions and their uses, see 420, 490. 
38. For the form and meaning of Prepositions in Composition, see 374. 
813. Inseparable Prepositions, so called because they are used only 
in composition, are the following: 
  
1 See 807, 2. 
2 But many adverbs, it will be remembered. are in origin case forms.
-P-A-G-E-161
    
CONJUNCTIONS 145 
ambi, amb, around, about in, not, un- séd, sé, aside, apart 
au, away, from por, toward, forth vé, not, without 
dis, di, asunder red, re, back 
1. For the form and meaning of the Inseparable Prepositions in Compo- 
sition, see 375. 
CONJUNCTIONS 
314. Conjunctions are mere connectives. They are either Coédrdinate 
or Subordinate. 
1. Codrdinate Conjunctions connect similar constructions : 
Labor voluptas-que,! labor and pleasure. 
Carthaiginem cépit ac! diruit, he took and destroyed Carthage. 
res 2. Subordinate Conjunctions connect subordinate with principal con- 
structions : 
Haec dum! colligunt, effiigit, while they collected these things, he escaped. 
Nore. —For the use of subordinate conjunctions, see 568, 574. 
315. Coérdinate Conjunctions comprise : 
1. Copulative Conjunctions, denoting Union = 
Et, que, atque,? ac, and; etiam, quoque, also; neque, nec, and not; 
neque .. . neque, nec. . . nec, neque. . . nec, neither... nor. 
2. Disjunctive Conjunctions, denoting Separation : 
Aut,® vel, ve, sive (seu), or; aut... aut, vel... vel, either... or; 
Sive.. ... sive, evher.. <= OT. 
Nore. — Here belong interrogative particles in double or disjunctive ques- 
tions: utrum... an, whether... or; an, or; annG6n, necne, or not; 
see 380. 
3. Adversative Conjunctions, denoting Opposition : 
Sed, autem, vérum, vérd, in truth, but; at, but, on the contrary; atqui, 
vather ; céterum, but still, moreover ;> tamen, yet. 
  
1 Here que connects two Nominatives, ac two Indicatives, which are entirely 
codrdinate, but dum connects the subordinate clause, haec . . . colligunt, with 
the principal clause, effiigit, he escaped while they collected these things. 
2 Copulative conjunctions are et and que with their compounds: et-iam, at- 
que, quo-que, ne-que. Ac is a shortened form of at-que; nec of ne-que. 
8 Disjunctives are aut, vel, and ve with their compounds. Vel is the Impera- 
tive of Vol6, lit. choose. 
4 Conjunctions, like adverbs, consist largely of case forms, chiefly from pro- 
nominal stems, especially from the stems of qui, quae, quod, 
5 Lit. as to the rest.

    146 MORPHOLOGY 
4. Ilative Conjunctions, denoting Inference 
Ergo, igitur, inde, proinde, itaque, hence, therefore. 
5. Causal Conjunctions, denoting Cause: 
Nam, namque, enim, etenim, for. 
316. Subordinate Conjunctions comprise: 
1. Temporal Conjunctions, denoting Time : 
Quand, quom,? cum, when; ut, ubi, as, when; cum primum, ut primum, 
ubi primum, simul, simulac, simul ac, simul atque, simul-atque, as soon as; 
dum, ddnec, quoad, quamdii, while, until, as long as; antequam, priusquam, 
before; posteaquam, after. 
2. Comparative Conjunctions, denoting Comparison : 
Ut, uti, sicut, as, so as; velut, just as; praeut, prout, according as, in 
comparison with ; quam, as; tanquam, quasi, ut si, velut si, as if. 
3. Conditional Conjunctions, denoting Condition : 
  Si,3 if; si ndn, nisi, ni, if not; sin, but if; si quidem or si-quidem, if 
indeed ; simodo, dum, modo, dummodo, if only, provided. 
4, Adversative and Concessive Conjunctions, denoting Opposition and 
Concession : 
Quamquam, licet,t cum, although; etsi, tametsi, etiamsi, even if; quam- 
vis,t quantumvis, quantumlibet,* however much, although; ut, grant that; 
né, grant that not. 
5. Final Conjunctions, denoting Purpose or End: 
Ut, uti, that, in order that; n&, néve (neu), that not; quo, that; quomi- 
nus,® quin, that not. 
6. Consecutive Conjunctions, denoting Consequence or Result: 
Ut, so that; ut non, so that not. 
  
1 But most causal conjunctions are subordinate ; see 316, 7. 
2 Quom, the original form from which cum was developed, occurs in early 
Latin, as in Plautus. Cum is the approved form in classical Latin. 
8 Probably a Locative. 
4 Licet is strictly a verb, meaning it is permitted ; vis, you wish, in quam-vis 
and quantum-vis, as much as you wish, and libet, it pleases, in quantum-libet, 
as much as it pleases, are also verbs. 
5 Quéminus = quo-minus, by which less; quin = qui-ne, by which not, origi- 
nally interrogative, how not?    
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  INTERJECTIONS 147 
%. Causal Conjunctions, denoting Cause: 
Quia, quod, quoniam,! quandd, because, inasmuch as; cum (quom), 
since; quanddquidem, si quidem or siquidem,? utpote, since indeed. 
8. Interrogative Conjunctions, in dependent or indirect questious :* 
Ne, nonne, nun, utrum, an, whether; an non, necne, or not. 
INTERJECTIONS 
317. Interjections are certain particles used as expressions of feeling 
or as mere marks of address. They may express 
1. Astonishment: 6, hem, ehem, attat, babae. 
2. Joy: id, euboe, euge, Gia, 6, papae. 
3. Sorrow: vae, ei, heu, éheu, ohé, ah, au, pro.

PART III. — ETYMOLOGY 
818. Words in our family of languages were originally formed 
by the union of primitive elements called Roots. 
319. In the formation of words in an inflected language, we 
distinguish Inflection, Derivation, and Composition ; but inflection 
and derivation are both the result of original composition. The 
suffixes of inflection and derivation are the worn and mutilated 
remains of original members of compound words. 
  
1 From quom-iam, when now. 
2 Lit. if indeed. 
8 These are sometimes classed as adverbs. In some of their uses they are 
plainly conjunctions, while in other cases they approach closely to the nature of 
adverbs. Asa matter of convenience they may be called Interrogative Particles ; 
see 378. 
4 Some interjections seem to be the simple and natural utterance of feeling, 
and accordingly do not appear to have been built up, like other words, from roots 
and stems, but to be themselves specimens of the unorganized elements of human 
speech. Others, however, are either inflected forms, as age, come, apage, be- 
gone, or mutilated sentences or clauses: meherculés, mehercule, etc., = mé 
Herculés iuvet, may Hercules protect me; médius fidius, may the true God 
help me. 
     
-P-A-G-E-164
  148 ETYMOLOGY 
INFLECTION AND DERIVATION 
320. Inflection forms Cases, Moods, Tenses, Numbers, and 
Persons by adding appropriate suffixes to stems: rég-is, rég-em, 
rég-és, rég-ibus; sta-t, sta-nt, sta-mus, sta-tis. 
1. In Latin, a stem which cannot be resolved into more prim- 
itive elements is also a root. Thus sta, the stem of sta-mus, is a 
root. Moreover, most roots have a strong form and a weak form. 
Thus sta in sta-s, sta-mus, sta-tis is the strong form, and sta in 
sta-tim, sta-tus is the weak form of the same root. 
- 321. Derivation forms new stems by adding formative suffixes 
to other stems or to roots. Thus from the root sta, it forms the 
stem sta-bili by adding the suffix bili, and from this again it forms 
the new stem sta-bili-tat by adding the suffix tat. 
322. Etymologically words may be divided into groups, each 
group being derived from one common root. Some of these 
groups are very large. Thus from the two forms of the single 
root sta, sta, to stand, are derived 
1, All the forms which make up the conjugation of the verb sto, stare, 
steti, statum, fo stand. 
2. All the forms of the verb sist6, sistere, stiti, statum, to place. 
3. Many other forms, including nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. 
323. Stems, the basis of all inflection, may be divided into 
three classes, as follows: 
1. Root Stems, identical with roots. 
2. Primary Stems, formed either from roots or from the stems of verbs by 
means of suffixes. 
3. Secondary Stems, formed from primary stems by means of suffixes. 
324. Words formed by inflection are called 
1. Root Words or Primitive Words, if formed from root stems: duc-is, 
of a leader, root stem duc ; es-tis, you are, root stem es. 
2. Primary Derivatives, if formed from primary stems: fac-td-rum, of 
deeds, from primary stem fac-to, from the root fac, seen in the verb fac-i6. 
3. Secondary Derivatives, if formed from secondary stems: sta-bili-tat-is, 
of stead-fast-ness, from the secondary stem sta-bili-tat, from the primary 
stem sta-bili, from the weak root sta. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
INFLECTION AND DERIVATION 149 
325. In the language inherited by the Romans, roots, stems, 
and suffixes sometimes appear with varying quantity, and even 
with different vowels in different words: 
1. With varying quantity: root reg in reg-ere, but rég in réx; leg in 
leg-ere, but lég in léx. 
2. With different vowels, with or without varying quantity: root teg in 
teg-ere, but tog in tog-a; da in da-mus, da-tus, but d6 in dd-num. 
326. These inherited vowel variations in some languages form 
a somewhat regular gradation, while in the Latin they have mostly 
disappeared, as kindred forms have been assimilated to each other. 
1. In classical Latin the suffix ter, tor, in its several forms, 
tr ter tér tor tor 
in pa-tr-is pa-ter cra-tér vie-tor vic-tér-is 
is the best illustration of this vowel gradation, called also Ablaut. 
2. This suffix is an illustration of what is called the E-Series of vowel 
gradation or ablaut, though the forms ter and tor were not inherited, but 
were shortened by the Latin from tér and t6r. The form tr, in which the 
vowel has disappeared, is said to have weak grade and is called a weak form, 
while ter, tér, tor, tér are said to have strong grade and are called strong 
forms. Moreover, tér and t6r are sometimes distinguished from ter and tor 
as the stronger or extended forms. 
3. In the examples given above (325) the roots reg, rég ; leg, lég; teg, 
tog, all belong to the B-Series, but the root which appears as da in da-mus, 
da-tus, and as d6 in dd-num, belongs to the O-Series. 
I. ROOT WORDS—FORMED FROM ROOTS BY INFLECTION 
827. The following are examples of Root Words: 
1. From Roors or raz Weak Grape or Weak Form 
Root duc: duc-is, of a leader duc-e duc-ibus 
da: da-re, to give da-mus da-tis 
S: sum, Iam s-umus s-itis 
2. From Roors or run Srrone Grave or Srronc Form 
Root es: es-se, to be es-t es-tis 
sta: sta-s, you stand sta-mus sta-tis 
rég: rég-is, of the king rég-e rég-ibus

II. PRIMARY DERIVATIVES 
828. From the stems of verbs are formed Participles and 
Verbal .Adjectives and Nouns with the following suffixes: 
Nom. ns tus, a, um tus tiirus, a, um ndus, a, um 
Stem nt, nti to, ta tu tiro, tira ndo, nda 
1. With the suffix ns are formed Present Participles, Verbal Adjec- 
tives, and Verbal Nouns: ama-ns, ama-nt-is, loving; innocé-ns, inno- 
cent; adulescé-ns, a youth. 
2, With the suflix tus, a, um, sometimes sus, a, um, are formed Perfect 
Participles, Verbal Adjectives, and Verbal Nouns: am4-tus, loved ; al-tus, 
tall, from al-ere, to nourish ; lega-tus, envoy, from lega-re, to commission ; 
fos-sa (from fod-ta), trench, from fod-ere, to dig. 
  Nore 1. —The suffix tus, a, um is also used in forming Secondary Deriva- 
tives; see 348. 
Nore 2. — The suffix nus, a, um is sometimes used in the sense of tus, a, 
um: plé-nus, full, from plé-re, to jill; d6-num, gift, from d6, da-re, to give. 
38. With the suffix tus, stem tu, are formed Supines and other Verbal 
Nouns: ama-tum, ama-tii; audi-tus, act of hearing, from audi-re; exer- 
citus, training, army, trained men, from exercé-re, to train. 
Nore. — For the use of -tus in forming Secondary Derivatives, see 344. 
4, With the suffix tiirus, a, um are formed Future Active Participles, and 
Verbal Nouns in tira: am4-tirus; cul-tira, « cultivating, from col-ere, to 
cultivate ; scrip-tiira, writing, written document, from scrib-ere, to write. 
5. With the suffix ndus, a, um, are formed Gerundives, Gerunds, and 
Gerundive Adjectives in undus, bundus, and cundus with the general 
meaning of participles, though they often denote a permanent characteristic : 
ama-ndus, ama-ndi, ama-nd6 ; sec-undus, following, from sequ-i, to fol- 
low; vita-bundus, avoiding, from vitad-re, to avoid; f4-cundus, eloquent, 
from fa-ri, to speak. 
Nore. — The suffix dus has nearly the same meaning as undus, bun-dus, 
and cun-dus: timi-dus, ¢imid, from timé-re, to fear. 
329. Important Verbal Adjectives denoting Capability, Adap- 
tation, generally passive but sometimes active, are formed with 
the suffixes ilis and bilis, stems, ili and bili: 
fac-ilis, Sacile, easy, from fac-ere, to make 
it-ilis, useful, 6s at-I,| to use 
ama-bilis, lovable, « amiac-re, to love 
Jauda-bilis, praiseworthy, lauda-re, to praise 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  PRIMARY DERIVATIVES 151 
1. With these suffixes adjectives are often derived from Perfect Par- 
ticiples : 
duct-ilis, ductile, from duct-us, led, drawn out 
miss-ilis, capable of being sent, ‘* miss-us, sent 
umbrat-ilis, living in the shade, “¢  umbrat-us, shaded 
vis-i-bilis, visible, “  vis-us, seen 
2. Some of these adjectives occasionally become nouns: miss-ile, a mis- 
sile, from mitt-ere, to send. 
3. From such examples as duc-t-ilis, mis-s-ilis, and umbr-at-ilis seem 
to have been derived the suffixes tilis, silis, and atilis, used in forming 
adjectives from nouns ; see 352, 
4. The stems ili and bili of ilis and bilis are derived from the stems ulo 
and bulo of ulus and bulum ; see 381, 1, 335. 
330. Verbal Adjectives with the general meaning of participles 
are formed with the suffixes 
  Nom. ax icus Tous iicus ius 
Stem ac, aci ico Ico Tico io: 
aud-ax, daring, from aud-ére, to dare 
loqu-ax, loquacious, “  Joqu-i, to talk 
med-icus, healing, medical, “  med-éri, to heal 
am-icus, loving, friendly, “¢ am-are, to love 
cad-iicus, Salling, frail, “ cad-ere, to fall 
exim-ius, select, choice, ‘¢exim-ere, to select out 
1. These suffixes are comparatively rare, except ax, which is a reduced 
form of acus. It often denotes a faulty inclination. The suffixes a-cus, 
i-cus, I-cus, and ii-cus are only different forms of a single suffix, produced 
by adding cus, to the stem-vowels 4, i, I, and a. 
2. <A few of these adjectives sometimes become nouns: med-icus, a physi- 
cian; am-icus, a friend. 
331. Verbal Adjectives having in general a meaning kindred 
to that of participles are formed with the suffixes 
Nom. ulus uus vus ivus 
Stem ulo uo vo Ivo: 
créd-ulus, credulous, from créd-ere, to believe 
noc-uus, hurtful, «“  noc-ére, to hurt 
ar-vus, plowed “  ar-dre, to plow 
ead-ivus, falling, ‘© cad-ere. to fall
-P-A-G-E-168
152 ETYMOLOGY 
1. The suffix ulus generally denotes a faulty tendency. In verbal adjec- 
tives it often becomes ilis: ag-ilis, agile ; see 329; uus, vus, and i-vus are 
only different forms of a single suffix. 
2. The suffix Ivus is often added to the stem of Perfect Participles, appar- 
ently making a new suffix, t-Ivus: cap-t-Ivus, captive, from cap-ere, cap-to, 
cap-t, to take ; ac-t-ivus, active, from ag-ere, ac-to, ac-t, to act. 
3. A few of these adjectives sometimes become nouns: ar-vum, plowed 
land, from ar-are, to plow; cap-t-ivus, a captive. 
4. The suffix Ivus, t-Ivus is also used in forming secondary derivatives ; 
see 350. 
Verbal Nouns 
332. Verbal nouns partake largely of the meaning of the verbs 
from which they are derived. They may be classified as follows: 
1. Verbal nouns denoting Action or its Result; see 333. 
2. Verbal nouns denoting the Agent or Doer of an action; see 334. 
38. Verbal nouns denoting the Means or Instrument of an action; 
see 335. 
Action or Its Result 
333. Verbal nouns denoting Action in the abstract, but often 
becoming concrete, are formed with the suffixes 
   Nom. id} tid or us és iés ium 
Stem ion tidn or Os, es és,i ié io: 
leg-i6, a levying, legion, men levied, from leg-ere, to levy 
audi-tid, a@ hearing, a report, «  audi-re, to hear 
vi-sid ,2 a seeing, a sight, “  vid-ére, to see 
tim-or, Sear, “ tim-ére, to fear 
gen-us, birth, “* gen in gign-ere, to bear 
frigus, cold, “ frig-ere, to be cold 
séd-és, seat, “  sed-ére, to sit 
fac-iés, Jace, ‘¢ fac-ere, to make

1. Most of these suffixes generally designate the action or state denoted 
by the verb, but és, iés, and ium sometimes designate the result of the 
action or the means employed: aedific-ium, edifice, from aedific-dre, to 
build; niib-és, cloud, from niib-ere, to veil. 
  
   1 The suffix i6 is compounded of i and Gn; tid of ti and Sn.

2. Here belongs the Latin Infinitive in ere, which is the Locative of a 
verbal noun, like genus, gen-eris, gen-ere. Observe that the Ablative end- 
ing ere, which includes the Locative meaning, is the same as that of the 
Infinitive. 
8. For the suffixes tus and tiira, see 328, 3 and 4. 
Agent or Doer 
334. Verbal nouns denoting the Agent or Doer of an action are 
formed from the stems of verbs or from roots with the suffixes 
Nom. tor ter, masculine tr-ix, feminine

1. The few nouns in Latin formed with the suffixes ter, tr, which, like 
tor, originally denoted the Agent, have become Names of Kindred: pa-ter, 
pa-tr-is, father ; ma-ter, ma-tr-is, mother ; fra-ter, fra-tr-is, brother. 
2. The suffix tr in pa-tr-is, ter in pa-ter, tor in vic-tor, and t6r in vic-tor-is, 
are only different forms of the same suffix. For vowel gradation or ablaut, 
as illustrated in these forms, see 21, 326, 1. 
83. The feminine suffix trix for tr-ics is an extension of tr, the weak form 
of tor, by the addition of ic-s, of which i is the inherited feminine suffix 
and s the Nominative suffix. i 
4, The suffix tor, though originally a primary suffix, is sometimes used to 
form denominatives: via-tor, a traveler, from via, a way; sen-a-tor, a 
senator, from sen-ex, an old man. 
5. The suffix tor, sor, is often extended to tér-ius, sdr-ius by the addi- 
tion of ius ; see 350, 2. 
6. A few nouns in a, 6 (Gen. dn-is), us, and ulus have a meaning kindred 
to that of Agent or Doer: scrib-a, a writer, from scrib-ere, to write; err-6, 
err-Gn-is, a@ wanderer, from err-dre, to wander; coqu-us, a cook, from 
coqu-ere, to cook; leg-ulus, a collector, from leg-ere, to collect. 
1 Observe that ter and tor in hwn-ter and direc-tor are used, as in Latin, to 
denote the agent or doer, and that in the feminine forms hun-tr-ess and direc-tr-ess 
they both take the weak form tr, as in the Latin véna-tr-ix. 
2T6n-sor is for tond-tor, dt changed to 8, but t6ns-trix is for tond-trix, dt 
changed to st before r; see 52, 1.

1The suffix s-trum may haye derived its s from such words as ca-s-trum, 
ra-s-trum, and r6-s-trum, in which s belongs to the root or stem. 
2 Cula, ula, bra, and bula differ from the corresponding forms in um only 
in gender; clum, culum, and crum are only different forms of a single suffix, . 
as are also brum and bulum. 
8%n Latin the form culum has almost entirely displaced the older form clum, 
4Fli-men, stream, that which flows; ag-men, army on the march, that 
which is led.

1. But the suffixes ménium and mG6nia, though originally used only in 
forming verbal nouns, were subsequently employed with great freedom in 
forming nouns from adjectives, or other nouns; see 344, 345. 
2. In early Latin men was a favorite suffix for the formation of verbal 
nouns, but it was subsequently extended to men-tum by the addition of 
tum; m6n, the strong-grade form of men, was also extended to mén-ia 
and m6n-ium, by adding ia and ium.

Diminutives— Nouns and Adjectives 
340. Diminutives of Nouns and Adjectives are generally formed 
with the following suffixes: 
lus, la, lum ulus, ula, ulum culus, cula, culum 
filio-lus, little son, from filius, son 
filio-la, little daughter, cer fli daughter 
atrio-lum, small hall, “ Strium, hall 
hortu-lus, small garden, “ hortus, garden 
oppidu-lum, small town, ‘  oppidum, town

pauper-culus, a,um, rather poor, “pauper, poor 
longius-culus, a, um,’ rather too long, *  longius, too long 
misel-lus, a, um, somewhat unfortunate, ‘* miser, unfortunate 
1. Lus, la, lum are appended to 4- and o-stems; ulus, ula, ulum to 
dental and guttural stems; culus, cula, culum to e-, i-, and u-stems and 
to liquid and s-stems ; see examples. 
2. Before lus, la, lum, the stem vowels 4 and o take the form of o 
after e or i, and the form of wu in other situations: filio-lus, filio-la, 
hortu-lus. 
8. Before culus, cula, culum, stems in u change u into i, and stems in 
on change o into u: versi-culus, a little verse; homun-culus, @ small 
man. Like nouns in on, a few other words form diminutives in un-culus, 
un-cula, though probably from an old stem in on: av-unculus, maternal 
uncle, from avus, grandfather. 
4, In Latin the diminutive suffix was originally lus, la, lum, from which 
was developed the form u-lus, u-la, u-lum by including as a part of the suffix 
the u in such words as hort-u-lus, oppid-u-lum, where it represents the 
1 Agel-lus is from agr(o)-lo-s, which became agr-lo-s, ager-lo-s, and finally 
agel-lus. 
2 Vil-lum is from vin(0)-lo-m, which became vin-lom and then vil-lum, 
8 The suffix cu-lus is often thus attached to the neuter of comparatives.

SECONDARY DERIVATIVES 157 
svem vowel of the primitive ; cu-lus was produced by adding the diminutive 
lus to the suffix co: co-lus, cu-lus. 
5. A few diminutives are formed with the suffixes id, c-id:1 piis-i6, piis- 
idn-is, @ little boy, from piisus, boy; homun-cid, homun-cidn-is, @ little 
man, from homs, man. 
341. Diminutive nouns in their true and proper signification 
represent objects simply as small, but they are often so used as to 
take on secondary meanings. Thus they sometimes become 
1. Terms of Endearment. Thus filiola may mean either litile daughter 
or my dear little daughter. 
2. Expressions of Sympathy or Regard. ‘Thus homunculus may mean 
either @ small man or a poor unhappy man. 
8. Expressions of Contempt. ‘Thus canicula may mean either @ small 
dog or a contemptible little cur. 
Patronymics 
342. The Latin Patronymics, or Names of Descent, were bor- 
rowed from the Greek. The common patronymic ending was 
developed for metrical reasons in two forms, as follows: 
Nom. idés iadés, masculine is ias, feminine 
Stem ida iada id iad 
Tantal-idés, son or descendant of Tantal-us 
Thest-iadés, son or descendant of Thest-ius 
Liert-iadés, son of Laert-es, viz. Ulysses 
Tantal-is, daughter or descendant of Tantal-us 
Thest-ias, daughter or descendant of Thest-ius 
1. In these examples observe that idés and is are used after a short sylla- 
ble and iadés and ias after a long syllable. 
2. By the union of idés with a preceding vowel was developed the ending 
idés: Thés-idés, son or descendant of Thes-eus. 
3. By the loss of iin iadés was formed the ending adés: Aene-adés, 
son or descendant of Aene-as. 
4, Nouns in eus generally form feminine patronymics in 6is or iIné ; nouns 
in us sometimes form them in Iné, and nouns in ius in ié6né: Nér-€is or 
Nér-iné, daughter of Ner-eus; Neptiin-iné, daughter or descendant of 
Neptune; Acris-idné, daughter of Acris-ius. 
1 The suffix ci-6 is compounded of the two diminutive suffixes co and i6, a 
formation quite analogous to that of cu-lus, 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
158 ETYMOLOGY 
343. Designations of Place, where trees and plants flourish, are 
often formed with the suffixes tum and é-tum: 
virgul-tum, thicket, from virgul-a, bush 
salic-tum, thicket of willows, “ salic-s (es=x), willow 
pin-é-tum, pine forest, *¢ pin-us, pine tree 
ros-6-tum, garden of roses, "6 ros-a, rose bush 
1. The suffix tum is the neuter of the participial suffix tus applied to 
nouns ; see $28, 2; thus virgul-tum is the neuter of the adjective virgul-tus, 
used as a substantive ; 6-tum is another form of the same suffix. The 6 was 
probably developed in such words as ol-€-tum, an olive garden, from ol-é-re, 
from which it derives its 6. ‘Thus ros-€-tum means literally a place furnished 
with roses. 
344. Derivatives denoting Office, Condition, or Characteristic 
are formed from nouns with the suffixes 
    
  Nom. ium m6énium tas tis tids atus 
Stem io m6nio tat tit tidin atu: 
magister-ium, office of master, from magister, master 
testi-minium, testimony, *  testi-s, witness

servi-tiis,? servitude, “* servu-s, servant 
servi-tiidd,? servitude, **  servu-s, servant 
consul-atus consulship, ‘6; consul, consul 
1. Derivatives in ium, tis, and atus sometimes become collective nouns: 
collégium, a body of colleagues, from colléga; a colleague; iuventiis, 
youth, young persons; sen-atus, senate, an assembly of old men. Many 
derivatives in tas are abstract nouns ; see 345, 
2. The final vowel of the stem disappears before ium but assumes the 
form of i before the other suffixes. Consonant stems sometimes assume 
i in imitation of vowel stems. 
8. The suffixes ium, tas, and tiis were all inherited; tid6d is closely 
related to tiis; 4-tus is the ending of nouns in tus derived from 4-verbs, as 
seen in 6rn-a-tus. For m6nium, see 336, 2. 
4, The endings 4g6 and igé occur in a few words: vir-Ag6, a masculine 
maiden, from vir; réb-ig6, rust, from rob-us, red. 
      
    1 Observe that patr-im6nium and aucts: sume i in imitation of

1. The suffixes ia, ié-s, were inherited; t-ia, t-iés were formed by adding 
ia, iés to t-stems, as sapient-ia, sapien-tia. 
2. The stem vowel o disappears before ia, iés; is changed to i before 
tia, tiés, and generally before the other suffixes, but it sometimes disappears, 
as in liber-tas ; after i it retains its ablaut form e, as in pie-tas. 
Adjectives from the Stems of Nouns 
346. Fullness. — Adjectives denoting Fullness, Abundance, or 
Supply are formed from nouns by means of the suffixes

  160 ETYMOLOGY 
1. The suffix dsus is one of the most important in the Latin language ; 
the number of adjectives formed with it has been estimated to amount to 
eight hundred. 
2. The suffix S6sus becomes i-Gsus by assuming i from some word like 
stud-i-6sus, studious, and it becomes u-Gsus by assuming u from some 
word like friict-u-6sus, fruitful. 
3. The suffixes tus, 4-tus, i-tus, and ii-tus are the regular participial 
endings here applied to the formation of adjectives from nouns.   
347. Material. — Adjectives designating the material of which 
anything is made are generally formed with the suffixes 
eus nus n-eus! “ac-eus ic-ius: 
aur-eus, of gold, golden, from aur-um,? gold 
argent-eus, of silver, ‘“* argent-um, silver 
fagi-nus i ae . \ of beech, beechen, “ fag-us,? a beech tree fagi-neus, 
TOs-eus. Ba } made of roses, 6+ TOS-2, a rose ros-dic-eus, 
striment-ic-ius, made of straw, “ striment-um, a straw 
1. Most of these suffixes sometimes take on a more general meaning and 
denote characteristic or possession ; pater-nus, paternal ; vér-nus, of spring, 
vernal; virgin-eus, maidenly. 
348. Characteristic. — Adjectives meaning in general belonging 
to, relating to, derived from, and the like, are formed from nouns 
with a great variety of suffixes. The following examples illus- 
trate the meaning and use of one class of these suffixes, viz. : 
  alis lis Tlis tilis aris arius: 
vit-alis, of life, vital, from vit-a, life 
mort-alis, mortal, “* mors, mort-is, death 
fid-élis, Saithful, « fides, faith, trust 
patru-élis, of an uncle, se patru-us, uncle 
ciy-ilis, civil, “ civ-is, citizen

curr-ilis, of a chariot, curule, ‘* curr-us, a chariot 
saliit-aris, healthful, “* saliit-is, good health 
statu-drius, pertaining to statues, ‘* statu-a, statue 
  
1The compound sufiix n-eus is formed by adding eus to no, the stem of 
nus; ac-eus by adding eus to 4c, the stem of 4x, and ic-ius by adding ius 
=eus to ico, the stem of icus; see 350. 
2Observe that the stem vowel is dropped before a vowel, but changed to 
i before a consonant. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
SECONDARY DERIVATIVES 161 
1. These several suffixes are only different varieties of lis; the long 
vowels have been assumed from the stems to which the suffix has been 
added. ‘Thus the 4 in vita-lis may be the stem vowel a of vita, but in 
mort-Alis it belongs to the suffix; the 6 in fidé-lis is the stem vowel 
of fid-és, but in patru-élis it belongs to the suffix. 
2. By dissimilation alis becomes Aris after 1, as in saliit-aris ; arius 
is an extension of aris. 
3. Adjectives formed with these suffixes often become nouns, especially 
those in drius, arium, alis, and ile: statu-arius, a statuary ; libr-arium. 
a bookcase, from liber, a book ; mort-Alis, a mortal, a human being ; ov-ile, 
a sheepfold, from ov-is, a sheep. 
349. The following examples illustrate the meaning and use 
of the suffixes 
nus a-nus é-nus inus ci-nus 
er-nus t-er-nus ur-nus t-ur-nus 
in the formation of adjectives : 
  vér-nus, of spring, vernal, from vér, spring

1. The basis of all these suffixes is nus; ci-nus is from co-nus ; it adds 
nus to co, the stem of cus; see 350; er-nus and ter-nus follow the analogy 
of such words as ac-er-nus and pa-ter-nus, while ur-nus and t-ur-nus 
follow eb-ur-nus and noc-t-ur-nus. 
2. The suffix cinus is sometimes extended to cinius: vati-cinius, 
prophetic. 
3. Many adjectives formed with these suffixes sometimes become nouns, 
and some words thus formed are always nouns in classical Latin: insul- 
Anus, an islander, from insul-a; urb-anus, a citizen, from urb-s; rég-ina, 
a queen, from réx, rég-is ; medic-ina, medicine, from medi-cus, a physician.

1. For ivus and t-ivus, see 331 and 831, 2. 
2. The other suffixes are only different forms and combinations of cus 
and ius, both of which are in common use in kindred languages ; t-icus and. 
t-I-cius obtain the t from participial stems; cius is an extension of cus; 
ius added to verbal nouns in tor and sor gives rise to the compound suffix, 
t6r-ius, sOr-ius, which may be applied directly to verb stems. Thus 6ra- 
tdr-ius is derived from the verb Gra-re through the verbal noun, 6ra-tor; 
see 334, 5. 
8. A few adjectives formed with these suffixes sometimes become nouns, 
and a few words thus formed are always used as nouns in classical Latin: 
riis-ticus, countryman, peasant, from riis, the country; patr-i-cius, patri- 
cian, from pater, father ; rég-ia, royal palace, from réx, king ; audi-t6r-ium, 
audience-room, from audi-tor, hearer.

while a few others are occasionally so used: paliis-tria, marshy places, from 
paliis, marsh ; eques-ter, knight, from eques, horseman. 
2. The endings ter, tris, es-ter, and es-tris are different forms of the 
same suffix; the development of es-ter and es-tris from ter and tris is seen 
by comparing eques-ter and eques-tris, in which es belongs to the stem, 
with camp-ester and silv-estris, in which it is a part of the suffix; énsis 
is from *ent-ti-s, in which t-t becomes s. 
352. The following examples illustrate the meaning and use 
of the suffixes 
ilis s-ilis 1 t-ilis! at-ilis! ti-mus i-ti-mus 
in the formation of adjectives : 
     hum-ilis, low, lowly, from hum-us, the earth, ground 
sumptuous, “  dap-s, Seast

mari-timus, maritime, ‘© mare for mari, sea 
lég-i-timus, lawful, “  1éx, lég-is, law 
353. Adjectives from proper names generally end in — 
anus, ianus, inus as, aeus, 6us ius, iacus, icus énsis, iénsis: 
Sull-anus, of Sulla, from Sulla, Sulla 
Mari-anus, of Marius, ‘© Marius, Marius

1. Anus and ianus are the endings generally used in derivatives from 
Names of Persons ; but others also occur. 
2. Many adjectives from names of places become Patrial Nouns in the 
plural and designate the citizens of those places : R6ém-ani, the Romans, 
from on -a; Lat-ini, the Latins, from Lat-ium. 
1 on these suffixes, see 329, 3.  
-P-A-G-E-180
  164 ETYMOLOGY 
354. The names of the Roman Gentes or Clans always ended in 
ius, masculine, and ia, feminine: 
Aemil-ius, Aemil-ia App-ius, App-ia Cas: 
Cornél-ius, Cornél-ia Fab-ius, Fab-ia Til-ius,    1. These forms in ius and ia are often used as adjectives: circus Flami- 
‘nius, the Flaminian circus; via Appia, the Appian way. 
2. Many of the names of the Roman gentes were derived from common 
nouns or from adjectives: Wirgin-ius, Virgin-ia, from virgo, maiden; 
Claud-ius, Claud-ia, from claud-us, lame. ‘ 
8. The name of the gens to which a Roman citizen belonged formed one 
of the three names which he regularly bore: the first, or praendmen, desig- 
nating the individual; the second, or n6men, the géns; and the third, or 
cdgndmen, the family. Thus Piblius Cornélius Scipid was Publius 
of the Scipio family of the Cornelian gens. 
4. Many Roman family names, c6gnémina, like the English surnames 
Smith, Carpenter, and Green, are derived from common nouns or adjec- 
tives: Cornicen, Horn-blower; Figulus, Potter; Capit-6, Big-head; 
Lupus, Wolf; Taurus, Bull; Niger, Black. 
5. Some personal names, praenGmina, are also derived from common 
nouns or adjectives: Aulus, Flute; Marcus, Hammer; Quintus, Fifth. 
6. In writing, personal names are generally represented by abbreviations : 
  A. = Aulus M. = Marcus S. (Sex.) = Sextus 
Ap. = Appius mM’. = Manius Ser. = Servius 
Cc. = Gaius Mam. = Mamercus Sp. = Spurius 
Cn. = Gnaeus! N. = Numerius Le = Titus 
D. = Decimus rE = Piblius Ti. (Tib.) = Tiberius 
L. = Licius Q. (Qu.) = Quintus 
7. Sometimes an A4gnédmen or surname was added to the three regular 
names. ‘Thus Scipié received the surname Africanus from his victories in 
Africa: Piiblius Cornélius Scipid Africanus. 
8. An adopted son took the full name of his adoptive father, and an 
agnomen in anus formed from the name of his own géns. Thus Octavius, 
when adopted by Caesar, became Gaius Iilius Caesar Octavianus. After- 
ward the title of Augustus was conferred upon him, making his full name 
Gaius Iilius Caesar Octavianus Augustus. 
9. Women were generally known by the name of their géns. Thus the 
daughter of Jiilius Caesar was simply Tilia; of Cornélius Scipid, Cornélia. 
Two daughters in any family of the Cornelian géns would be known as 
Cornélia and Cornélia Secunda or Minor.

DERIVATION OF VERBS 165 
Adjectives from Adverbs and Prepositions 
355. A few adjectives are formed from adverbs and preposi- 
tions with the following suffixes: 
  nus a-neus arius er-nus ter-nus tur-nus ti-nus 
ter-nus, three-fold, from ter, three times 
extr-aneus. ‘ < ‘ wi } from without, external, ‘*  extr-a, on the outside extr-arius, 
hodi-ernus, of this day, “  hodi-é, this day, to-day 
hes-ternus, of yesterday, *: heri for hes-i, yesterday 
diii-turnus, } eae, ii + it im 
dii-tinus, toads dia, a long time 
DERIVATION AND HISTORY OF LATIN VERBS 
356. The oldest Latin verbs were all inherited from the parent 
speech. They comprise three classes: 
I. Root Verbs, in which the bare root is the present stem. 
II. Thematic Verbs, in which the present stem ends in the thematic 
vowel. 
Ill. Verbs whose present stem is formed with the suffix io. 
I.—Root Verbs 
357. In Root Verbs personal endings are added directly to the bare 
root, which forms the present stem. ‘This is the most primitive form of 
verbal inflection known in our family of languages, and has almost dis- 
appeared from the Latin. Only a few isolated forms of irregular verbs 
remain, of which the following are the most important: 
1. From the root es, to be: es = es-s, es-t, es-tis, es-te, es-td, es-tote. 
2. From the root 6d, és, to eat: 6-s=Gd-s, &s-t, és-tis, Es-te, Es-td, 
&s-tote. 
38. From the root i, to go: 3-s, i-t, I-mus, L-tis, Ite, I, 1-t6, tote. 
4. From the root fer, to bear: fer-s, fer-t, fer-tis, fer-te, fer, fer-t6, 
fer-t6te, with a few passive forms. 
5. From the root vel, vol, to wish: vol-t, vul-t, vol-tis, vul-tis. 
6. From the root dé, da, to give: dé, da-s = dé-s, da-t, da-mus, da-tis, 
da-nt, da, da-te, da-t6, da-tdte. 
Norr.— Many forms from these roots are thematic, as s-u-m, s-u-mus, 
s-u-nt, etc,  
-P-A-G-E-182
166 ETYMOLOGY 
II. — Thematic Verbs 
358. The Present Stem ends in the thematic vowel, which was orig- 
inally e or o, but in Latin it generally takes the form of ior u. The 
personal endings are added to this vowel. This class includes most verbs 
of the Third Conjugation: 
rég-e-re, to rule; rég-i-t, rég-i-mus, rég-i-tis, rég-u-nt.   
III. — Verbs formed with the suffix io 
859. ‘This class includes four sub-divisions : 
1. A group of A-Verbs, in which the present stem ends in 0, from i-io, 
in the first person singular of the Present tense and in 4 in the other 
persons : 
hiadre, to gape; present stem, hi-o, hi. hi-6,1-hi-a-mus, _hi-a-tis 
lavare, to wash; ** es lay-o,: lav-i: lav-d, lav-a-mus, lav-d-tis 
  2. A group of E-Verbs, in which the present stem ends in eo, from @-io 
or e-io, in the first person singular of the Present tense and in é in the 
other persons : 
favére, to favor ; present stem, fav-eo, fay-6: fay-ed,1 fay-é-mus, fay-é-tis 
vidére, to see; Ce “«  -yid-eo, vid-é: vid-ed, vid-é-mus, vid-é-tis 
Nore 1,— A few verbs formed with the suffix e-id are causative in mean- 
ing: mon-e6, mon-é-re, to cause to remember, from the root men, remem- 
ber ; noc-eG, noc-é-re, to cause to suffer, from nec, death, ruin. 
Nore 2.—In Causative verbs, the root vowel e takes its ablaut form 03; 
see 326, 3. Hence the root men becomes mon in mon-e6; nec becomes 
noc in noc-e6. 
3. A group of I-Verbs, in which the present stem ends in io, from 
iio, in the first person singular of the Present tense, in iu in the third 
person plural, and in i in the other persons: 
venire, to come; pres. stem ven-io, ven-iu, ven-i: ven-id, ven-i-mus, ven-iu-nt, 
Norr. —In a few verbs in i6, the thematic vowel takes the place of 1: 
capere, to take: cap-id, cap-i-mus, cap-i-tis, cap-iu-nt. 
4. Probably a very few U-Verbs, in which the present stem ends in 
o, from io, in the first person singular of the Present tense and in the 
thematic vowel in the other persons: 
suere, to sew, su-6, su-i-mus, su-i-tis, su-u-nt 
  
1 Observe that the first person singular of the Present has 6, but that its stem 
has 0.
-P-A-G-E-183
  
DERIVATION OF VERBS 167 
Nors. — The four groups of inherited verbs just mentioned — viz. a group 
of a-verbs, or verbs of the First Conjugation, a group of e-verbs, or verbs 
of the Second Conjugation, a group of i-verbs, or verbs of the Fourth Con- 
jugation, and a very few u-verbs of the Third Conjugation — served the 
Romans for all time as models for the formation of new verbs from the 
stems of nouns and adjectives. ‘Thus all the Latin verbs were either in- 
herited by the Romans or made by them on inherited models. 
THE FORMATION OF VERBS FROM THE STEMS OF NOUNS 
AND ADJECTIVES 
360. A-Verbs are generally formed from a-stems, but sometimes 
from other vowel stems and even from consonant stems, especially 
from n- and s-stems: 
cur-6, -a-re, to care for, from ciir-a, care 
lacrim-6, -a-re, to shed tears, “© Jacrim-a, tear 
numer-o, to number, «¢  numer-us, number 
lev-6, to lighten, “6 lev-is, light 
aestu-6, to rage, “  aestu-s, a raging 
nomin-d, to name, «*  nédmen, name 
oner-6, to burden, “¢ onus, oner-is, burden 
  361. E-Verbs are generally formed from o-stems,! rarely from 
consonant stems: 
alb-e6, -6-re, to be white, from alb-us, white 
claud-ed, -é-re, to be lame, *  s  claud-us, lame 
fl6r-ed,  -€-re, to flower, se flds, flor-is, flower 
liic-ed, —--é-re, to be light, “Tix, liic-is, light 
1. H-Verbs are generally intransitive; indeed, from the same stem are 
sometimes formed an a-Verb with a transitive meaning and an e-Verb with 
an intransitive meaning : 
alb-e6, -€-re, to be white, \ *, fi 1 alb-6, -a-re, to make white, Egy oliste 
clir-ed, -é-re, to be bright, * | = lar clar-6, -d-re, to make bright, } Sere bright 
362. I-Verbs are generally formed from i-stems; but sometimes 
from o-stems, u-stems and consonant stems: 
fin-id, fin-i-re, to finish, from fin-is, end 
lén-id, Jén-i-re, to make gentle, “. lén-is, gentle 
  
1 Remember that o-stems have an ablaut form in @.  
-P-A-G-E-184
    168 ETYMOLOGY 
serv-id,  serv-I-re, to serve, from sery-us, servant 
gest-i5,  gest-i-re, to gesture, **  gest-us, gesture 
ciistéd-id, ciistdd-i-re, to guard, “  cistés, guard 
363. U-Verbs are formed from u-stems: 
met-ud, met-u-ere, to fear, from met-us, Sear 
stat-ud, stat-u-ere, to place, “  stat-us, position, place 
364. Frequentatives, or Intensives, denote Repeated, Continued, 
or Intense Action. They are of the First Conjugation, and are 
formed from verb stems or roots with the following suflixes: 
td 8d itd tits sits 
cap-t6, to snatch, from cap-ere, to take 
da-to, to give frequently, “ da-re, to give 
cur-s6, to run about, ‘s  cur-rere, to run 
ag-itd, to move violently, ss _ag-ere, to move, drive 
serip-titd? to write often, ‘**  scrib-ere, to write 
cur-sitd, to run hither and thither, ‘* cur-rere, to run 
1. Frequentatives were originally denominatives formed from the parti- 
ciple in tus or sus, but its became an independent suffix and was added to 
the stems of verbs, regardless of the form of the participle ; hence ag-it6, 
not ac-t6. The extension of to or so by it6 gives the compound suffix titd 
or sit6, but some verbs formed with these suffixes may be explained as de- 
rivatives from other frequentatives. Thus cant-it6 may be formed from 
cant-6, a frequentative from can-6 ; curs-it6 from curs-6 from cur-r6. 
2. A few Intensives of the Third Conjugation, denoting Eager rather 
than Repeated action, end in ess6, rarely iss6 : -fac-ess6, to do or perform 
eagerly, from fac-ere, to do, perform; incip-iss6, to begin eagerly, from 
incip-ere, to begin. 
  865. Inceptives, or Inchoatives, denote the Beginning of the 
action. They are regularly formed from the present stem of 
verbs by adding seo: 
gela-scd, to begin to freeze, from geli-re, _to freeze 
calé-scd, to begin to be warm, ss calé-re, to be warm 
viré-scd, to grow green, “¢ viré-re, to be green 
obdormi-seé, to fall asleep, ‘*  obdormi-re, to sleep 
1. The endings 4sc6, ésc6, and iscé, including the stem vowel of the 
primitive, finally became independent suffixes, and were added to the stems 
of verbs and apparently to the stems of nouns without regard to the char- 
1 Remember that before t, g becomes ¢ and b becomes p; see 55, 1,
-P-A-G-E-185
COMPOSITION OF WORDS 169 
acter of the stem vowel: trem-&sc6, trem-isc6, to begin to tremble, from 
trem-ere, to tremble ; puer-Asc6, to reach boyhood, from puer, a boy. 
366. Desideratives, denoting a Desire to perform the action, 
end in turid or surid: 
émp-turid,! —_to desire to purchase, from em-ere, to purchase 
scrip-turid, to desire to write, ‘*  scrib-ere, to write 
é-surid,? to desire to eat, “  ed-ere, to eat 
867. Diminutives, denoting a feeble action, end in id: 
cant-ill-d, -adre, to sing feebly, from cant-dre, to sing 
conscrib-ill-d, -are, to scribble, ‘*  cdnscrib-ere, to write 
1. Diminutives in ill6 are probably formed from verb stems through 
diminutive verbal nouns. 
368. Denominatives are also formed with the suffixes icd 
and igo: 
medic-or, medic-arl, to heal, from medic-us, physician 
claud-icd, claud-icire, to be lame, “© claud-us, lame 
rémig-6, remig-dre, to be an oarsman, ‘* rémex, oarsman 
mit-ig6, mit-igire, to make gentle, “ mit-is, gentle 
1. Observe that in medic-or the letters ic belong to the stem of medic-us, 
while in claud-ic6é they have become a part of the suffix ic6d; also that in 
rémig-6 the letters ig belong to the stem of rémex, while in mit-ig6é they 
have become a part of the suffix ig6. 
COMPOSITION OF WORDS 
369. Many compound words are formed by uniting two or more 
stems and adding the suffixes of inflection when needed. The stem 
vowel of the first member of the compound generally disappears be- 
fore a vowel and generally takes the form of i before a consonant: 
magn-animus, from magno-animo-s, magnanimous, o disappears 
grand-aevus, ‘© grandi-aevo-s, of great age, i disappears 
omni-poténs, *  omni-potent-s, omnipotent, i retained 
corni-cen, “© cornu-cen, trumpeter, u changed toi 
capri-cornus, ‘©  capro-cornu-s, capri-corn, o changed toi 
  
1Em-p-turid ; p is generally thus developed between m and t; see 52, 5. 
2 B-surid, from *éd-turid, from 64, the strong form of the root of ed-6; for 
euphonic changes, see 52, 1.  
-P-A-G-E-186
    
170 ETYMOLOGY 
1. Consonant stems generally assume i before another consonant, as, 
honGr-i-ficus, honorable. 
2. The ending of the second member is sometimes slightly changed, espe- 
cially in compound adjectives, which regularly pass into the I-Declension : 
multi-f6rm-is, with many forms. 
8. Compounds in ex,! dex, fex, cen, cida, and cola deserve notice: 
rém-ex, oarsman; iti-dex, judge; arti-fex, artist; corni-cen, cornet- 
player ; homi-cida, man-slayer; agri-cola, tiller of the soil. 
4, Note also compound adjectives in ceps,? fer, ger, dicus, ficus, and 
volus: parti-ceps, taking part; auri-fer, bearing gold; armi-ger, carrying 
arms, armor-bearer ; fati-dicus, prophesying ; miri-ficus, causing wonder ; 
bene-volus, well-wishing. 
870. Compound words are also formed by prefixing an inde- 
clinable particle to an inflected word with which it could not be 
used separately in the same sense: 
Im-memor, un-mindful ; in-somnis, sleep-less ; inter-régnum, an inter- 
regnum, the interval between two reigns; per-nox, lasting all night; per- 
facilis, very easy ; ad-esse, to be present; 6-discere, to learn thoroughly. 
371. Compound words are also formed by uniting two or more 
words which already sustain to each other some syntactical 
relation : 
Duo-decim, twelve; Mars-piter, father Mars; postri-dié, on the fol- 
lowing day; quot-annis, yearly, on all years ; magn-operé = magnd opere, 
greatly ; dé-nuG = dé nov6, a-new. 
1. In these examples observe that words, not stems, are united: duo and 
decem ; Mars and pater. 
2. Compounds formed by the union of two or more words are sometimes 
called Syntactic Compounds, Many such were formed by the Romans during 
the classical period. 
372. Compound Nouns and Adjectives may be divided according 
to their meaning into three classes : 
1. Determinative Compounds, in which the second part is qualified by the 
first: inter-réx, interrex; bene-volus, well-wishing; per-magnus, very 
great ; in-dignus, unworthy. 
   1 Ex (ig-is), dex (dic-is), fex (fic-is), cen, cid-a, and col-a are derived from 
the verbal roots seen in ag-ere, to drive; dic-ere, to tell; fac-ere, to make ; 
can-ere, to sing, play; caed-ere, to slay, and col-ere, to cultivate. 
2 Cep-s, fer, ger, dic-us, fic-us, and vol-us are from the roots of cap-ere 
to take; fer-re, to bear; ger-ere, to carry; dic-ere, to tell ; fac-ere, to make, 
and vol.6, vel-le, to wish.
-P-A-G-E-187
  COMPOUND VERBS 171 
2. Objective Compounds, in which the second part is limited by the first 
as object: prin-ceps, taking the first place; belli-ger, waging war; homi- 
cida, one who slays a man; agri-cola, one who tills the field. 
3. Possessive Compounds, generally best rendered by supplying having or 
possessing : aéni-pés, having bronze feet ;1 celeri-pés, swift-footed ; ali-pés, 
wing-footed, having wings for feet; magn-animus, having a great soul. 
373. Compound Verbs. — Verbs in general are compounded only 
with prepositions, originally adverbs :? 
Ab-ire, to go away ;* ex-ire, to go out;® préd-ire, to go forth; con- 
vocare, to call together ; dé-cidere, to fall off; prae-dicere, to foretell. 
1. But a few compounds of faci6 and f16 contain a verbal form in e or é: 
cale-facere, to make warm; cale-fierl, to become warm; consué-facere, 
to accustom. 
2. Verbs are often united with other words in writing without strictly 
forming compounds: satis facere or satis-facere, to satisfy, do enough 
for ; animum advertere or anim-advertere, to notice, turn the mind to. 
38. Verbs in fic6, like the following, are probably best explained as de- 
nominatives:* aedi-ficdre, to build, from aedifex ; ampli-ficdre, to enlarge, 
from amplificus. 
4. Verbs compounded with prepositions often undergo certain vowel 
changes in accordance with phonetic law; see 231. 
374. Prepositions in Composition. — The following facts in regard 
to the Form and Meaning of prepositions in composition are added 
for reference: 
1. A, ab, abs. Form: a before mand v, and before f in the verb sum; 
abs before c, q, t, and, with the loss of b, also before p; ab in other 
situations. Meaning: away, off: a-mittere, to send away; abs-condere, 
to hide away ; ab-esse, to be away; a-fui, I have been away; abs-portare, 
as-portare, to carry off; in adjectives, generally negative: 4-méns, without 
mind, frantic; ab-similis, wn-like. 
2. Ad. Form: generally unchanged, but d is assimilated before c, gen- 
erally before p and t, and sometimes before g, 1, r, and s, and generally 
dropped before gn, sc, sp, and st. Meaning: to, toward, to one’s self; on, 
  
1 Observe the force of the compound. Aénus pés means a brazen foot, but 
aéni-pés means having brazen feet. 
2 The words thus formed are strictly compounds of verbs with adverbs. 
8 Observe in these examples the strict adverbial use of the particles ab, ex, 
ete., away, out, ete. Prepositions, on the other hand, always denote relations, 
and are auxiliary to the case endings; see 312. 
4 In some of these the primitive is not found in actual use.

PART IV.—SYNTAX 
SYNTAX OF SENTENCES 
I. CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES 
376. Syntax treats of the construction of sentences. 
377. A sentence is a word, or a combination of words, express- 
ing either a single thought or two or more thoughts. 
1. A simple sentence expresses a single thought: 
Romulus urbem condidit, Romulus founded the city. 
2. A compound sentence consists of two or more simple sentences : 
Ego régés éiéci, vos tyrannds intrédicitis, I have banished kings, you 
introduce tyrants. 
3. A Declarative Sentence has the form of an assertion: 
Miltiadés acciisitus est, Miltiades was accused. 
4, An Interrogative Sentence has the form of a question: 
Quis non paupertatem extiméscit, who does not fear poverty ? 
5. An Imperative Sentence has the form of a command or entreaty: 
Libera rem piblicam metii, free the republic from fear. 
6. An Exclamatory Sentence has the form of an exclamation: 
Reliquit quos virds, what men he has left! 
378. Simple Interrogative sentences are generally introduced 
by an interrogative pronoun, adjective, or adverb, or by an inter- 
rogative particle, ne, non-ne, or num: he asking for information ; 
nonne generally implying an affirmative answer, and num a nega- 
tive answer : : 
Quis doctior Aristotele fuit, who was more learned than Aristotle ? Quid 
tandem té impedit, what, pray, hinders you ? Hora quota est, what time is 
it? Ubinam gentium sumus, where in the world are we ? Estisne vos légati 
wish to be renowned? Num igitur peccimus, are we then at fault ? 
1. But questions in Latin, as in English, sometimes dispense with the in- 
terrogative word, especially in impassioned discourse :
-P-A-G-E-191
  
SYNTAX OF SENTENCES 175 
Ego non poterd, shall I not be able? Vis récté vivere, do you wish to live 
vightly ? 
2. The particle ne is regularly appended to the emphatic word of the sen- 
tence ; appended to n6n it forms n6n-ne. It is, however, sometimes added 
to other interrogative words without affecting their meaning, as in utrum-ne, 
quanta-ne, etc. 
3. An emphatic tandem, meaning indeed, pray, then, is often found in 
interrogative sentences, as in the second example. 
4. Nam appended to an interrogative also adds emphasis, as in ubinam 
in the fourth example. 
5. For two interrogatives in the same clause, and for an interrogative 
with tantus, see 511, 3 and 4. 
379. Answers.—In replying to a question of fact the Latin 
usually repeats some emphatic word, or its equivalent, often with 
prorsus, véro, and the like, or, if negative, with non: 
Nempe negas, do you indeed deny? Prorsus negd, certainly I deny; 
C, Tuse. 5, 5. Possumusne esse titi, can we be safe? Non possumus, we 
can not; C. Ph. 12,12. Tuam vestem détraxit tibi, did he strip your garment 
from you? Factum, he did, lit. done = it was done; '. Eun. 707. 
1. Sometimes the simple particle is used —affirmatively, sané, etiam, 
ita, vér6, certé, etc. ; negatively, n6n, minimé, etc. : 
Visne sermOni démus operam sedentés, do you wish us to (that we should) 
attend to the conversation sitting? Sané quidem, yes indeed; C. Leg. 2,1. 
Vénitne, has he come? Non, no; Pi. Ps. 1067. 
880. Double or Disjunctive Questions offer a choice or alterna- 
tive. The first clause generally has utrum or ne, or it omits the 
particle; the second generally has an, as follows: 
utrum,. an, 
ne, an, } whether, or 
mf an, 
Utrum ea vestra an nostra culpa est, is that your fault or ours? Romamne 
venid, an hic maneam, am I going to Rome or am Ito remain here? Haec 
yéra, an falsa sunt, are these things true or false? 
1. A negative in the second clause gives an nén, very rarely nec-ne: 
Isne est quem quaerd, an non, ts he the one whom I seek or not? T. Ph. 852. 
Sunt haec tua verba, necne, are these your words, or not? C. Tuse. 3, 18. 
2. In poetry and later prose the first clause may have utrum-ne, or 
utrum... ne, and the second an:  
-P-A-G-E-192
  176 SYNTAX 
Utrumne persequémur Gtium, an, etc., shall we enjoy our leisure, or, etc. ? 
Utrum praedicemne, an taceam, shall I make it known, or be silent? 
3. By the omission of the first clause, the second sometimes stands alone 
with an in the sense of ov, and sometimes. an is used to introduce inter~ 
rogative sentences which do not seem to involve an ellipsis: 
Quid ais, what do you say? An vénit Pamphilus, or has Pamphilus come? 
4. By the omission of the second clause, the first sometimes stands alone 
with utrum : 
Utrum hic bellum non est, is not this war? C. Ph. 8, 2, 7. 
5. One or two rare forms occur in poetry, as ne... ne, in Vergil, and 
... me, once in Horace: 
Tiistitiaene prius mirer belline, should I more admire your regard for jus- 
tice or your martial deeds? V.11, 126. Maidra mindrane fama, are they supe- 
rior or inferior to their fame? H. B. 1, 11. 
6. Disjunctive, or Compound Questions, are sometimes extended to three 
or more members. Indeed Cicero, Prd Domi, 22, 57, has a question of this 
kind with eight members. 
Il. ELEMENTS OF SIMPLE SENTENCES 
381. The Simple Sentence, alike in its most simple and in its 
most expanded form, consists of two distinct parts, expressed or 
implied, and of only two: 
1. The Subject, or that of which it speaks. 
2. The Predicate, or that which is said of the subject. 
382. The Simple or unmodified Subject may be a noun, a pro- 
noun, expressed or implied, or some word or words used as a 
noun; and the Simple or unmodified Predicate may be either a 
verb alone or a suitable verb, generally sum, with a Predicate 
Noun or a Predicate Adjective: 
Cluilius moritur, Cluilius dies. Ego scribd, Iwrite. Vicimus, we have con- 
quered. Dolére malum est, to suffer is an evil. Vita cara est, life is dear. 
1. In these examples observe that the subjects are Cluilius, ego, the 
pronoun implied in vici-mus, the Infinitive dolére used as a noun, and 
vita. These subjects are all in the Nominative, according to 387. 
2. Observe that the predicates are moritur, scribé, vicimus, malum 
est and cara est. Malum, thus used, is called a Predicate Noun, and cara 
a Predicate Adjective, 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  SYNTAX OF SENTENCES 177 
383. The Complex Subject consists of the simple subject with 
one or more modifiers, generally an adjective, a noun in apposition, 
or a Genitive: 
Albanus réx moritur, the Alban king dies. Cluilius réx moritur, Cluilius 
the king dies. Periitilés Xenophdntis libri sunt, the books of Xenophon are 
very useful. 
1. Observe that the complex subjects are Albanus réx, Cluilius réx, 
and Xenoph6ntis libri. 
2. In distinction from a predicate noun, or a predicate adjective, any 
noun or adjective used simply as a modifier of the subject, or of any other 
noun, is called an Attributive Noun or Adjective. 
3. A noun or pronoun, used to describe or identify another noun or pro- 
noun denoting the same person or thing, is said to be in Apposition with it 
and is called an Appositive: Cluilius réx, Cluilius the king. Appositives 
therefore form one variety of attributive nouns. 
384. The Complex Predicate consists of the simple predicate 
with its modifiers. These may be objective modifiers, adverbiai 
modifiers, or both: 
Gloria virtiitem sequitur, glory follows merit. Sapientés féliciter vivunt, 
the wise live happily. Tn his castris Cluilius moritur, in this camp Cluilius 
dies. Pons iter paene hostibus dedit, the bridge well-nigh offered a passage 
to the enemy. 
1, Here observe that the modifier in the first example is the object virti- 
tem, in the second the adverb féliciter, in the third the adverbial expres- 
sion in his castris, and in the fourth the direct object iter, the indirect 
object hostibus, and the adverb paene. 
2, All nouns may be modified like the subject ; see 888. 
8. All adjectives may be modified by adverbs, and some adjectives may 
be modified by certain oblique cases: 
Satis humilis est, he is sufficiently humble. Semper avidi laudis fuistis, 
you have always been desirous of praise. Habétis ducem memorem vestis, 
you have a leader mindful of you. 
I. ELEMENTS OF COMPOUND SENTENCES 
385. A Compound Sentence may consist of two or more inde- 
pendent sentences, combined without any change of form: 
Sol ruit et montés umbrantur, the sun hastens to its setting and the moun- 
tains are shaded. Audendum est aliquid, aut omnia patienda, something 
must be risked, or everything must be endured. 
HARK. LAT. GRAM. —13 
   
-P-A-G-E-194
  178 SYNTAX 
386. A Compound Sentence may consist of two or more sen- 
tences so combined that one of them retains its independent form 
while the others are made subordinate to it: 
Priusquam incipias, cdnsult6 opus est, before you begin, there is need of 
deliberation. 
1. In sentences of this kind the part which makes complete sense, — c6n- 
sultG opus est, there is need of deliberation, —is called the Principal or 
Independent Clause ; and the part which is dependent upon it, — prius- 
quam incipias, before you begin, —is called the Dependent or Subordinate 
Clause. 
2. The subordinate clause may be the subject or the predicate of the 
compound sentence or the modifier either of the subject or of the predi- 
cate : 
Quid diés ferat,! incertum est, what a day will bring forth is uncertain. 
Exitus fuit dratidnis, sibi nillam cum his amicitiam esse posse,! the close of 
his oration was that he could have no friendship with them. Figo, qui té 
confirmé,! ipse mé non possum, J who encourage you am unable to encour- 
age myself. Zénonem, cum Athénis essem,! audiébam, I heard Zeno when 
Iwas at Athens. 
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE— RULES OF AGREEMENT 
SUBJECT NOMINATIVE 
387. Rule. — The subject of a Finite Verb is put in the 
Nominative : 
Romulus régnavit, Romulus reigned. Gloria virtiitem sequitur, glory 
follows merit. Ignord quid agis, I do not know how you are. Ego réges 
iéci, vos tyrannos intrddicitis, I have banished kings, you introduce 
tyrants; Ad Her. 4, 53. 
  1. A Pronominal Subject is seldom expressed, as it is implied in the ending 
of the verb, as in the third example, but it may be expressed for emphasis 
or contrast, as in the last example. 
2. For the different forms of the subject, see 382. 
3. The subject of an Infinitive is put in the Accusative ; see 415. 
1In the first example, the clause quid diés ferat is the subject ; in the second, 
sibi . . . posse is the predicate; in the third, qui. . . cOnfirm6, a modifier of 
the subject; and in the fourth,cum . . , essem, a modifier of the predicate.
-P-A-G-E-195
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE— RULES OF AGREEMENT 179 
AGREEMENT OF VERB WITH SUBJECT 
388. Rule. —A Finite Verb agrees with its Subject in 
Number and Person: 
Romulus urbem condidit, Romulus founded the city. Castor et Polliix 
ex equis pignare visi sunt, Castor and Pollux were seen to fight on horse- 
back ; C.N.D. Scribam ad té, J shall write to you.    
  1. Participles in compound tenses also agree with the subject in gender 
according to 894, 1, as in the second example. 
2. For the pronominal subject implied in the verb, as in the last exam- 
ple, see 387, 1. 
8. A General or Indefinite subject is often denoted by impersonal passive 
forms and by certain persons of the active, as the first and third person 
plural Indicative and Subjunctive and the second person singular Subjunctive, 
dicimus, we (people) say; dicunt, they say ; dicas, you (any one) may say: 
Ad vesperum pignitum est, they fought till evening. Quae volumus, 
crédimus, we believe what we wish. Agere quod agias cdnsideraté decet, you 
should do considerately whatever you do ; ©. Off. 1, 27. 
4. The verb is sometimes omitted, when it can be readily supplied, espe- 
cially est and sunt in proverbs and brief sayings : 
Omnia praeclara rara, all excellent things are rare; ©. Am. 21. Quot homi- 
nés, tot sententiae, as many opinions as men; T. Ph. 454. Ecce tuae litterae, 
lo, your letter ; C. Att. 18, 16. 
5. Dic6é and facié are often omitted in short sentences and clauses : 
Pauca dé mé, a few words in regard to myself; C.N.D.3,2. Quid opus 
est pliira, what need of (saying) more ? C. Sen. 1,3. Quae cum dixisset, Cotta 
finem, having thus spoken (when he had thus spoken), Cotta closed (made 
an end); ©. N. D. 8, 40. 
6. Faci6 is often omitted in Livy after nihil aliud (amplius, minus, etc.) 
quam, nothing other (more, less, etc.) than, merely; nihil praeterquam, 
nothing except, merely : 
Nihil aliud quam stetérunt parati ad pignandum, they merely stood pre- 
pared for battle ; L. 84, 46. 
7. Certain brief forms of expression very often dispense with the verb: 
quid, what ? quid enim, what indeed ? quid erg6, what then ? quid quod, 
what of the fact that ? né plira, not to say more; quid héc ad mé, what 
ts this to me ? nihil ad rem, nothing to the subject.  
-P-A-G-E-196
    180 SYNTAX 
389. Synesis.— Sometimes, especially in poetry and in Livy, 
the predicate is construed according to the real meaning of the 
subject without regard to grammatical gender or number. Thus 
1. With collective nouns, iuventiis, multitid6, pars, and the like. 
These, though singular in form, are often plural in sense : 
Tuventiis ruit certantque, the youth rush forth and contend; V. 2, 63, 
Multitiidd abeunt, the multitude depart; L. 24,3. Magna pars abeunt, a large 
part withdraws ; 8. 60, 8. 
Norge. —In the first example, observe that the former of the two verbs is 
in the singular and the latter in the plural, not an uncommon construction 
with collective nouns. 
2. With milia, often masculine in sense: 
Sex milia peditum mére Macedonum armati fuére, six thousand of the 
infantry were armed in the manner of Macedonians ; L. 37, 40. : 
3. With quisque, uterque, alius...alium, alter... alterum, and 
the like : 
Uterque edrum exercitum @diicunt, each of them leads out his army; 
Caes. 6.3, 30. Alius alium domés suas invitant, they invite each other to their 
homes ; 8. 66, 8. 
4. With a singular subject accompanied by an Ablative with cum : 
Dux cum principibus capiuntur, the leader with his chiefs is taken ; L. 21, 60. 
5. With partim . . . partim in the sense of pars . . . pars: 
Bonérum partim necessaria sunt, partim non necessaria, of good things 
some are necessary, others are not necessary ; C. Part. 24, 86. 
6. Occasionally in poetry with a neuter pronoun or adjestize limited 
by a Partitive Genitive : 
Quid hic tantum hominum (= tot hominés) incédunt, why are so many 
men coming this way ? Pl. Poen. 619. 
390. The verb agrees, not with its subject, but with the Predi- 
cate Noun, or with a noun after quam, nisi, etc., when that noun 
is nearer than the subject and when the subject is an Infinitive 
or a clause : 
Non omnis error stultitia dicenda est, not every error should be called 
folly ; ©. Div. 2,43. Pueri Trdianum dicitur agmen, the boys are called the 
Trojan band; V.5, 602. Nihil aliud nisi pax quaesita est, nothing but peace 
was sought ; 0. Off. 1,23. Contentum suis rébus esse maximae sunt divitiae, 
to be content with one’s own is the greatest wealth ; ©. Parad. 6, 8.
-P-A-G-E-197
SUBJEOT AND PREDICATE— RULES OF AGREEMENT 181 
391. The verb often agrees, not with its subject, but with an 
Appositive, regularly when the appositive is oppidum: 
Corinthus, Graeciae liimen, exstinctum est, Corinth, the light of Greece, was 
extinguished ; C. Man. 5,11. Volsinii, oppidum Tuscdrum, concrematum’ est, 
Volsinii, a town of the Tuscans, was burned. 
392. With two or more subjects, the verb may agree either 
with one subject and be understood with the others, or with all 
the subjects conjointly : 
Homérus fuit et Hésiodus ante R6mam conditam, Homer and Hesiod lived 
before the founding of Rome; C. Tuse.1, 1,3. Aut morés spectari aut fortina 
solet, either character or fortune is wont to be regarded. Pompéius, Lentulus, 
Seipid periérunt, Pompey, Lentulus; and Scipio perished. Ego et Cicerd 
valémus, Cicero and I are well; C. Fam. 14,5. Tia et Tullia valétis, you and 
Tullia are well. Pater mihi et mater mortui sunt, my father and mother are 
dead; T. Eun. 517. Labor voluptasque inter sé sunt iiincta, labor and pleasure 
are joined together ; L. 5, 4. 
1. The verb generally agrees with one subject and is understood with the 
others, when it stands before the subjects or between them, as in the first 
example, and when the subjects represent inanimate objects, as in the second 
example. 
2. A verb agreeing conjointly with subjects differing in Person, takes the 
first person rather than the second and the second rather than the third, as 
in the fourth and fifth examples. 
3. A participle in a compound tense, agreeing conjointly with subjects dif- 
fering in Gender, is masculine if the subjects denote persons, otherwise gen- 
erally neuter, as in the sixth and seventh examples, 
4. Lwo Subjects as a Unit. — Two singular subjects forming in sense a 
Unit or Whole admit a singular verb : 
Cui senatus populusque Rodmanus praemia dedit, to whom the senate and 
Roman people (i.e. the state as a unit) gave rewards; C. Balb. 4, 10. Sed 
tempus necessitasque postulat, but the time and necessity (i.e. the crisis) 
demand ; ©. Off. 1, 28, 81. 
5. With Aut or Neque.— When subjects connected by aut, vel, neque, 
nec, sive, or seu are of the same person, the verb generally agrees with 
the nearest subject, but when they differ in person, the verb is generally 
plural : 
Aut Briitus aut Cassius iidicavit, either Brutus or Cassius judged. Haec 
neque ego neque tii fécimus, neither you nor I have done these things; T. Ad. 
103.

SYNTAX 
APPOSITIVES AND PREDICATE NOUNS 
  393. Rule. — A noun used as an Appositive or as a Predi 
cate of another noun denoting the same person or thing 
agrees with it in Case: 
Appositives. — Cluilius réx moritur, Cluilius the king dies. Saguntum, 
foederatam civitatem, exptignavit, he took Saguntum, an allied town. 'The- 
mistoclés véni ad te, I, Themistocles, have come to you; N. 2,9. Venus, 
régina Cnidi, Venus, the queen of Cnidus; H. 1, 30. 
Predicates. — Usus magister est, experience is a teacher; ©. BR. Post. 4, 9. 
Vita magistra est, life is an instructress ; ©. Rose. A. 27, 7. Exstitisti tii 
vindex nostrae libertatis, you have appeared as the defender of our liberty. 
Servius réx est décliratus, Servius was declared king. 
1. -An appositive or a predicate noun with different forms for different 
genders must agree in gender as well as in case; as Cluilius réx, Venus 
régina, iisus magister, vita magistra, above. 
2. An appositive or a predicate noun may agree with a pronoun, whether 
expressed or only implied in the ending of a verb. Thus Themistoclés above 
agrees with a pronoun implied in véni, while vindex agrees with tii ex- 
pressed. 
3. Clauses. — A noun or pronoun may be an appositive or predicate of a 
clause, or a clause an appositive or predicate of a noun or pronoun : 
Céterum, id quod non timébant, prope libertas amissa est, but liberty was 
almost lost, that which they did not fear; L. 2, 8. Facinus est vincire civem 
Romanum, to bind a Roman citizen is a crime. Oraculum datum erat vic- 
tricés Athénas fore, an oracle had been given that Athens would be victori- 
ous ; C. Tuse. 1, 28. 
4, Partitive Apposition. —The parts may be appositives or predicates of 
the whole, or the whole may be an appositive or predicate of the parts : 
Duo régés, ille bell6, hic pice, civitatem auxérunt, two kings advanced the 
interests of the state, the former by war, the latter by peace; L.1,21. Ptole- 
maeus et Cleopatra, régés Aegypti, Ptolemy and Cleopatra, rulers of Egypt ; 
et, L. 87, 8. Nautius et Fiirius consulés erant, Nautius and Furius were con- 
suls; L. 2, 89. 
5. Predicate Apposition.— Appositives sometimes have nearly the force 
of subordinate clauses : 
Aedem Saliitis dictator dédicavit, he dedicated the temple of Salus when 
(he was) dictator ; L. 10, 1, 9. 
6. Possessives admit a Genitive in apposition with the Genitive implied 
in them «
-P-A-G-E-199
AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES 183 
Ad tuam ipsius amicitiam, to your own friendship. Nomen meum absentis, 
my name in my absence. 
7. Locatives admit appositives in the Locative Ablative, with or without 
a preposition : 
Albae cdnstitérunt in urbe opportiina, they halted at Alba, a convenient 
city; ©. Ph. 4,2, Corinthi, Achaiae urbe, at Corinth, a city of Achaia; 
Tac, H. 2,1, 
8. Predicate nouns are most frequent with sum and a few intransitive 
verbs, 6vadG, exsist6, appare6d, and the like, and with passive verbs of 
Appointing, Making, Naming, Regarding, and the like. 
9. Predicate nouns are used, not only with finite verbs, but also with 
Infinitives and participles, and sometimes without verb or participle : 
Orestem sé esse dixit, he said that he was Orestes. Décliratus réx Numa, 
Numa having been declared king. Caninid consule, Caninius being consul. 
10. In the poets, predicate nouns are used with verbs of a great variety 
of signification : 
Réxque paterque audisti, you have been called both king and father (have 
heard yourself so called); H. E. 1,7, 87. Ego quae divom incéd6 régina, J who 
walk as queen.of the gods; V. 1, 46. 
11. The Dative of the object for which (483), pr6 with the Ablative, and 
loc6 or numer6 (or in numerG) with the Genitive, are often kindred in 
force to predicate noun: 
  Malo est hominibus avaritia, avarice is an evil to men (is to men for an 
evil). Sicilia ndbis prd aerarid fuit, Sicily was a treasury (for a treasury) 
for us. Dedrum numerd eos diicunt, they consider them as gods (in the num- 
ber of). 
12. For the Predicate Accusative, see 410, 1.    
AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES 
394. Rule. — Adjectives, whether Attributive or Predi- 
cate, agree with their nouns in Gender, Number, and Case: 
Fortiina caeca est, Fortune is blind. Vérae amicitiae sempiternae sunt, 
true friendships are enduring. Usus magister est optimus, Experience is 
the best teacher. Taec aurea vasa, these golden vessels. S61 oriéns diem 
cOnficit, the sun rising makes the day. Certum est liberds amari, it is 
certain that children are loved. 
1. Demonstratives and participles are adjectives in construction, and 
accordingly conform to this rule, as haec vasa, s6l oriéns. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
    184 SYNTAX 
2. Remember that in the passive forms of the verb the participle some- 
times agrees with a predicate noun or with an appositive ; see 390, 391. 
8. For the distinction between an attributive adjective and a predicate 
adjective, see 383, 2. 
4, Agreement with Clause, etc. — An adjective may agree with any word 
or words used substantively, as with a pronoun, clause, infinitive, etc. Thus, 
in the last example, certum agrees with liber6s am&ri. When an adjective 
agrees with a clause, or with an Infinitive, it is always neuter, generally 
singular, but in poetry it is sometimes plural as in Greek : 
Ut Aenéas iactétur nota tibi, how Aeneas is tossed about is known to you; 
V. 1, 667. 
5. A neuter adjective used substantively sometimes supplies the place of 
a predicate adjective : 
Cum mors sit extrémum, since death is the last thing ; ©. Fam. 6, 21. 
lupus stabulis, a wolf is a sad thing for the flocks ; V. ¥. 8, 80. 
     
6. A neuter adjective with a Genitive is often used in poetry and in late 
prose, rarely in Caesar and Cicero, instead of an adjective with its noun ; 
especially in the Nominative and Accusative: 
Miratur strata vidrum,! he admires the paved streets ; V.1, 422. Corruptus 
vanis rérum, deluded by vain things; H.8.2;2. Cuncta terrérum subacta, all 
lands subdued ; Mi. 2, 1, 28. 
7. Sometimes, though chiefly in poetry, the adjective or participle con- 
forms to the real meaning of its noun, without regard to grammatical gender 
or number : 
Pars certaére parati, a part (some) prepared to contend ; V.5,108. Absente 
nobis (= mé), in my absence; T. Eun. 649. Démosthenés cum céteris erant 
expulsi, Demosthenes with the others had been banished ; N. 19, 2. 
8. Agreement with One Noun for Another.— When a noun governs 
another in the Genitive, an adjective belonging in sense to one of the two 
nouns sometimes agrees with the other, especially in poetry and late prose: 
MaiGra rérum initia, the beginning of greater things; L.1,1. Ad itsti 
cursum amnis, to the regular course of the river; L.1, 4, 
9. In poetry an adjective or participle predicated of an Accusative is some- 
times attracted into the Nominative to agree with the subject: 
Ostendit sé dextra, she shows herself favorable ; V. 2, 388. 
895. An adjective or participle, belonging in sense to two or 
more nouns, may agree with one and be understood with the 
others, or it may agree with them all conjointly : 
  
1 Strata vidrum, poetical for stratas vias.
-P-A-G-E-201
  AGREEMENT OF PRONOUNS 185 
Dubitare visus est Sulpicius et Cotta, Sulpicius and Cotta seemed to doubt ; 
0. Or. 1, 62. Temeritds igndratidque vitidsa est, rashness and ignorance are 
bad. Castor et Pollix ex equis pignare visi sunt, Castor and Pollux were 
seen to fight on horseback ; 0. N, D.2, 2 
1. An attributive adjective generally agrees with the nearest noun; a 
predicate adjective less frequently : 
Agri omnés et maria, all lands and seas; ©. Tuse. 1,28. Huic Hyperidés 
proximus et Aeschinés fuit, next to him were Hyperides and Aeschines ; 
©. Brut. 9, 36, 
2. A plural adjective or participle used with two or more nouns of differ- 
ent genders is generally masculine, when the nouns denote living beings, or 
are in a manner personified, otherwise generally neuter, used substantively ; 
see 394, 5: 
Pater mihi et mater mortui sunt, my father and mother are dead; 
ef. T. Eun, 517. Réx régiaque classis! profecti, the king and the royal fleet set 
out. Hondrés, imperia, victoriae fortuita sunt, honors, commands, and vic- 
tories are accidental things ; ©. Of. 2,6. Inimica inter sé sunt libera civitas 
et réx, a free state and a king are things hostile to each other. Labor 
voluptasque, dissimillima natiira, inter sé sunt itincta, Jabor and pleasure, 
things most unlike by nature, are joined together.   
Nore. — Moreover, with nouns denoting inanimate objects, the adjective 
or participle is sometimes neuter, irrespective of the gender of the nouns: 
Stultitia et temeritas et iniiistitia sunt fugienda, folly, rashness, and 
injustice are things to be avoided ; ef. 0. Fin. 8, 11, 
3. Two or more adjectives in the singular may belong to a plural noun: 
prima et vicésima legiGnés, the first and twentieth legions. 
4, In the same manner two or more praendmina, personal names, in the 
singular may be combined with a family name in the plural: Gnaeus et 
Piblius Scipi6nés, Gnaeus and Publius Scipio. 
5. For Roman names, see 354, 3. 
AGREEMENT OF PRONOUNS 
396. Rule. — Pronouns agree with their antecedents in 
Gender, Number, and Person: 
Némo est qui t@ non metuat, there is no one who does not fear you. 
Graeci rébus istis, quas nds contemnimus, délectantur, the Greeks are de- 
lighted with those things which we despise. Nihil agis quod ego non videam, 
  
1 Here régia classis is in a manner personified, as it represents the soldiers 
who manned the fleet. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
186 SYNTAX 
you do nothing which 4 do not see. Ego qui té confirma, ipse mé non pos- 
sum, f who encouraged you am not able to encourage myself. Vis est in 
virtitibus; eas excita, there is strength in virtues ; arouse them. 
1. When the antecedent is a determinative in agreement with a personal 
pronoun, the relative takes the person of the latter: 
Haec is féci qui sodalis Dolabellae eram, I who was the companion of 
Dolabella did this; C. Fam. 12, 14. 
2. Pronouns which have predicate nouns associated with them generally 
agree by attraction with those nouns: 
Animal quem! yocémus hominem, the animal which we call man; ©. Leg. 
i,7 Thébae quod! Boedtiae caput est, Thebes which is the capital of Boeotia; 
L. 42,44. Ea erat confessid, that (the fact stated) was an admission ; L. 1, 45. 
Nor. — Pronouns are not usually attracted when they are neuter and 
stand in a negative sentence nor when the predicate noun is a foreign 
proper name; 
Nec sopor illud erat, nor was that sleep; V.3,1%3. Flimen quod appel- 
lJatur Tamesis, a river which is called the Thames ; Caes. 5, 11. 
3. Pronouns, when used as adjectives, conform, of course, to the ordinary 
rule for adjectives ; see 394. 
397. Synesis.— The Pronoun is sometimes construed according 
to the real meaning of the antecedent without regard to gram- 
matical form, and sometimes it refers to the class of objects to 
which the antecedent belongs: 
Equitatum praemittit qui videant, etc., he sends forward his cavalry to see, 
etc.; Caes. 1,15. Earum rérum utrumque, each of these things; C. Div. 1, 52. 
Quia fessum militem habébat, iis quiétem dedit, as he had an exhausted sol- 
diery, he gave them rest. Démocritum omittaémus; nihil est enim apud istds, 
let us omit Democritus ; for there is nothing in the works of such. 
398. Two or More Antecedents. — When a pronoun refers to two 
or more antecedents, it generally agrees with them conjointly, but 
it sometimes agrees with the nearest, or the most important: 
Pietas, Virtiis, Fidés, quarum? Romae templa sunt, Piety, Virtue, and 
Faith, whose temples are at Rome; ©. Leg. 2, 11. Praeter culpam ac pecca- 
tum, qua? semper carébis, except fault and error, from which you will ever 
be free; ©. Fam. 5, 21. 
4 Quem attracted from quod to agree with hominem; quod attracted from 
quae to agree with caput, and ea from id to agree with cOnfessi6. 
2 Quarum agrees with Pietas. Virtis, Fidés, conjointly ; qua with culpam, 
the more important.
-P-A-G-E-203
AGREEMENT OF PRONOUNS 187 
1. With antecedents differing in gender, the pronoun conforms to the 
rule for adjectives, being generally masculine if the antecedents denote 
persons, otherwise neuter ; see 395, 2: 
Laténa et Apolld et Diana, quorum divinum domicilium compilayit, La- 
tona, Apollo, and Diana, whose divine abode he pillaged; ©. Ver. 5,72. In- 
constantia et temeritas, quae digna non sunt ded, inconstancy and rashness, 
whick are things not worthy of a god; cf. 0. N. D.3, 24. 
2. With antecedents differing in person, the pronoun conforms to the 
rule for verbs, preferring the first person to the second and the second to 
the third, see 392, 2- 
Errastis et ti et collégae tui qui spérastis, both you and your colleagues 
who hoped, have made a mistake ; ©. Agr. 1, 7. 
399. Relative Construction. — Originally the relative was a pro- 
nominal adjective in agreement with the antecedent repeated in 
the relative clause, as itinera duo, quibus itineribus, two ways, by 
which ways. Generally the antecedent is retained in the principal 
clause and omitted in the relative clause, but sometimes it is re- 
tained in the relative clause and omitted in the principal clause, 
and sometimes it is omitted in both. Hence the following forms: 
1. Antecedent in both clauses: 
Erant itinera duo, quibus itineribus dom6 exire possent, there were two 
ways by which they were able to go from home ; Caes. 1, 6. 
2. Antecedent omitted in the relative clause, the usual construction : 
Marius qui Italiam obsididne liberavit, Marius who freed Italy from siege. 
8. Antecedent omitted in the principal clause, but retained in the rela- 
tive clause. In this construction the relative clause in classical prose 
generally stands first : 
In quem égressi sunt locum, Trdia vocatur, the place where (into which) 
they landed is called Troy; L.1,1. Quam quisque norit artem, in hac sé 
exerceat, let every one practice the art which he knows ; ©. Tuse. 1, 18, 41. 
4, Antecedent omitted in both clauses. This is common when the ante- 
cedent is indefinite, or is implied in a possessive pronoun, or in an adjective : 
Sunt qui cénseant, there are some who think. Vestra, qui cum integritate 
vixistis, hoc interest, this interests you who have lived uprightly ; C. Sull. 28, 79. 
Servili tumulti, qués, ete., in the revolt of the slaves whom, etc.; Caes. 1, 40. 
Norz.—In the second example, the antecedent of qui is a personal pronoun 
implied in vestra, and in the last example the antecedent of qués is serv6- 
rum implied in servili, of the slaves
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 SYNTAX 
5, Attracted.— The relative is sometimes attracted into the case of the 
antecedent, and in poetry, rarely in prose, the antecedent is sometimes at- 
tracted into the case of the relative : 
Notante itidiee, qua! ndsti, when the judge whom you know reprimands ; 
H. 8. 1, 6, 14. Urbem,! quam statud, vestra est, the city which I am building 
is yours ; V. 1, 578. 
6. Clause as Antecedent. — When the antecedent is a sentence or clause, 
the pronoun is in the neuter singular, but the relative generally adds id as an 
appositive to such antecedent : 
Régem, quod numquam antea acciderat, necivérunt, they put their king to 
death, which had never before happened ; ©. Of. 2, 28. Sin & vobis, id quod 
non spér6, déserar, but if I should be deserted by you, which I do not expect; 
©. Rose. A. 4, 10. 
USE OF CASES 
GENERAL VIEW OF CASES.—NOMINATIVE AND VOCATIVE 
400. Cases, in accordance with their general meaning and use, 
naturally arrange themselves in pairs, as follows: 
{ Nominative, Case of the Subject. 
| Vocative, Case of the Person Addressed. 
TL Accusative, Case of the Direct Object. 
Dative, Case of the Indirect Object. 
TH. owe Case of Adjective Relations. 
* | Ablative, Case of Adverbial Relations. 
Norn. —The Nominative, Vocative, Genitive, Dative, and Accusative have 
probably retained, with very slight modifications, their original force as de- 
veloped in the mother tongue from which the Latin was derived. For the 
Ablative, see 459. 
NOMINATIVE 
401. The Nominative is used as follows: 
1. As Subject of the Sentence; see 382, 1; 387. 
As Appositive to another Nominative; see 393. 
As Predicate Nominative; see 393. 
see 421, 3. In Exclamations 
  1 Qué attracted from quem into the case of the antecedent; urbem attracted 
from urbs into the case of the relative.
-P-A-G-E-205
  
USE OF CASES 189 
VOCATIVE. —CASE OF ADDRESS 
  402. Rule.— The name of the person or thing addressed 
is put in the Vocative: 
Tuum est, Servi, régnum, the kingdom is yours, Servius. Quid est, Cati- 
lina, quod té délectare possit, what is there, Catiline, which can please you? 
O di immortalés, O immortal gods. 
1. An Interjection may or may not accompany the Vocative. 
2. In poetry, and sometimes in prose, the Nominative in apposition with 
the subject occurs where we should expect the Vocative : 
Audi tii, populus Albanus,! hear ye, Alban people ; L. 1, 24. 
3. Conversely, the Vocative by attraction sometimes occurs in poetry 
where we should expect the Nominative : 
Quibus, Hector, ab Gris exspectate venis, from what shores, Hector, do 
you anxiously awaited come? V. 2, 282. Tane libentius audis, you prefer to be 
called Janus?; H. 8. 2, 6, 20. Macte nova virtiite,? a blessing on your new 
valor’; V. 9, 641. 
ACCUSATIVE 
403. The Accusative is used as follows: 
As Direct Object; see 404. 
As Direct Object and Predicate; see 410. 
As Double Object — Person and Thing; see 411. 
As Direct Object with Infinitive; see 414. 
As Subject of Infinitive; see 415. 
As Accusative of Specification; see 416. 
As Accusative of Time, Space, and Limit; see 417, 418. 
With Prepositions and in Exclamations; see 420, 421. SOE ST RS O2,,ND 
Accusative as Direct Object 
404. Rule. —The Direct Object of an action is put in the 
Accusative : 
Marius Italiam liberavit, Marius freed Italy. Populi Romani salitem 
défendite, defend the safely of the Roman people. Romulus Romam condi-   
  
1 But populus Alb&nus may be a Nominative form with the Vocative mean- 
ing following the analogy of all nouns and adjectives except those in us; see 75, 1. 
2 Or, you more gladly hear yourself called Janus. 
8 Supply est6. Literally be enlarged by your new valor. In this expression, 
macte has become so far indeclinable that it is used in the Accusative singular 
and in the plural.
-P-A-G-E-206
    190 SYNTAX 
dit, Romulus founded Rome. Librum dé rébus risticis scripsi, J wrote a 
book on rural affairs. 
1. The Direct Object may be either the Person or Thing on which the 
action of the verb is directly exerted, as Italiam and saliitem above, 
or the Result of the action, the object produced by it, as R6mam and 
librum. 
2. Passive Construction.—In the passive construction, the noun or 
pronoun which is the direct object of the active becomes the Subject 
Nominative : < Pe 
Laudant exquisitissimis verbis legidnés, they praise the legions with the 
choicest words. Laudantur exquisitissimis verbis legidnés, the legions are 
praised with the choicest words ; ©. Ph. 4, 3, 6. 
  38. An Infinitive or a Clause may be used as a direct object ; 
Vérum audire non vult, he does not wish to hear the truth. Quis sim sciés 
you will know who Iam. 
4, The object of a transitive verb is often omitted when it can be easily’ 
supplied: moved = moved mé, I move; vertit = vertit sé, he turns. 
405. Special Verbs. — Note the use of the Accusative with the 
following special verbs, many of which admit other constructions, 
as the Dative or the Ablative with or without aé. Thus: 
1. With verbs of Feeling or Emotion, of Taste and Smell; as déspi- 
rare, to despair, to despair of ; Aol6re, to grieve, to grieve for; gemere, iio 
sigh, to sigh over; horr6re, to shudder, to shudder at; maerére, to mourn, 
to mourn over ; mirari, to wonder, to wonder at; ridére, to laugh, to laugh 
at; sitire, to thirst, to thirst after; olére, redolére, to have an odor, to 
have the odor of ; sapere, to have taste, to have the taste of: 
Meum casum doluérunt, hey mourned over my misfortune; ©. Sest. 69, 
Pacem déspéravi, I despaired of peace; C. Att. 7,20. Détrimenta ridet, 
e laughs at lusses; H. E. 2, 1, 121. Oratidnés redolentés antiquitatem, ora- 
tions savoring of antiquity ; C. Brut, 21, 82.     
  Norr. — Dolére takes the Accusative or the Ablative with or without dé ; 
déspérare, the Accusative, the Dative, or the Ablative with dé; olére and 
redolére, the Accusative or Ablative: Gélictd dolére, to grieve over a fault ; 
saliiti or dé saliite déspérare, to despair of safety ; sibi déspérare, to de- 
spair of oneself; redolére thym6, to have the odor of thyme. 
2. With a few other verbs; as diirare, to grow hard, to make hard; sup- 
peditare, to abound, to furnish bountifully ; tacére, to be silent, to pass over 
in silence : 
Ego multa tacui, Ihave passed over many things in silence; C.C.4,1,2 7  
-P-A-G-E-207
ACOUSATIVE 191 
8. Several impersonal verbs admit the Accusative; as decet, it befits; 
dédecet, it does not bejit; iuvat, i pleases; fallit, fugit, praeterit, 7 
escapes : 
Oratdrem irasci minimé decet, it by no means becomes an orator to be 
angry. Nisi mé fallit, unless it escapes me, unless I mistake. 
4, Miseret, paenitet, pudet, taedet, and piget take the Accusative and 
Genitive ; see 457. 
Nors. — Many verbs which are usually rendered by transitive verbs in 
English are intransitive in Latin, and thus admit only an Indirect Object or 
some special construction ; see 426. 
406. Many Compounds of intransitive verbs with prepositions, 
especially compounds of verbs of motion with circum, per, praeter, 
trans, and super, take the Accusative: 
Mutinam cireumsedent, they are besieging Mutina. Murmur contidnem 
pervasit, a murmur went through the assembly. Pyrénaeum transgreditur, 
he crosses the Pyrenees. Undam innatat alnus, the boat floats upon the 
stream; V.G.2,451. Téla modo exit, he only avoids the blows ; V. 5, 438. 
407. In poetry, rarely in prose, a few verbs, chiefly those of 
Clothing and Unclothing, —indu6, exu6, cing, accings, etc., — are 
sometimes used reflexively in the passive, like the Greek Middle 
Voice, and thus admit an Accusative: 
Galeam induitur, he puts on his helmet ; V. 2,392. Initile ferrum cingitur, 
he girds on his useless sword; V.2, 510. Pueri suspénsi loculés lacert6, boys 
with satchels hung upon the arm; H.8.1, 6,73. Pascuntur silvas, they browse 
upon the forests; V.G@.3, 314. Tind necdum antiquum saturata dolérem, Juno 
not yet having appeased her old resentment ; V.5, 608. 
408. Verbal Adjectives and, in Plautus, a few Verbal Nouns 
occur with the Accusative: 
    Vitabundus castra hostium, avoiding the camp of the enemy; L. 2%, 18 
Quid tibi hanc cfiratidst rem (ciratidst = ciiratid est), why do you care for 
this ? Pl. Amph. 519, 
409. Cognate Accusative. — Even Intransitive verbs admit the 
Accusative of an object of cognate or kindred meaning, generally 
‘with an adjective or other modifier : 
Tiitam vjtam vivere, to lead a secure life; ©. Ver. 2,47. Consimilem liise- 
rat ille lidum, he had played a similar game; T. Eun. 586. Némd servitiitem 
Servivit, no one lived in servitude; ©. Ton 6. 29

voice sounds human; V. 1, 828. Cordnari Olympia, to be crowned with the 
Olympic crown; H. E. 1, 1, 50, 
Two Accusatives of the Same Person 
410. Rule. —Verbs of Making, Choosing, Calling, Regard- 
ing, Showing, and the like, admit Two Accusatives of the 
Same Person or Thing: 
Hamilearem imperatorem fécérunt, they made Hamilcar commander, 
N. 22,2, Ancum régem populus creavit, the people made Ancus king; L.1, 82. 
Summum consilium appellarunt senatum, they called their highest council a 
senate ; cf. C.Sen.6. Cato Flaccum habuit collégam, Cato had Flaccus as a 
colleague ; N. 24,1. 
1. Predicate Accusative. — One of inese two Accusatives is the Direct 
Object and the other a Predicate Accusative. In the passive the direct 
object of the active becomes the subject Nominative and the predicate 
Accusative becomes the predicate Nominative : 
Populus Romanus cdnsulem mé fécit, the Roman people made me consul. 
Consul factus sum, I was made consul. 
2. Habére, to have, admits two Accusatives, as in the fourth example 
under the rule, but when it means to regard, it usually takes, instead of the 
predicate Accusative, the Dative, the Ablative with in or pré, or the Geni- 
tive with loc6, numer6 or in numers: 
Paupertas probré habéri coepit, the absence of wealth began to he regardea 
as a disgrace; 8. ©. 12. Sésé illum non pro amicé, sed hoste habitiirum, that 
he should regard him, not as a friend, but as an enemy ; Caes. 1, 44. Reductds 
in hostium numerd habuit, he regarded them as enemies, when brought back. 
Norr. — These constructions are also used with cther verbs meaning to 
regard. 
  3. The Predicate Accusative is often an adjective: 
Ipsis caecds reddit avaritia, avarice makes them blind; cf. ©. Rose. A. 85.
-P-A-G-E-209
  
ACCUSATIVE 193 
Two Accusatives — Person and Thing 
411. Rule. — Some verbs of Asking, Demanding, Teach- 
ing, and Concealing admit Two Accusatives — one of the 
Person and one of the Thing: 
Mé sententiam rogavit, he asked me my opinion; ©. Q. Fr. 2,1. Pacem 
té poscimus, we demand peace from you; V, 11. 362. Philosophia nos rés 
omnés docuit, philosophy has taught us all things; cf. C. Leg. 1,22. Non té 
célavi sermonem, J did not conceal the conversation from you; ©. Fam, 2, 16. 
     
   
       
   
     
    
    
    
          
   
       1. In the passive the Person becomes the subject and the Accusative 
of the Thing is retained : 
Rogatus ego sententiam multa dixi, having been asked my opinion I stated 
many things; C. Att. 1,16. Omnés militiae artés édoctus fuerat, he had been 
taught all the arts of war; L. 25, 81. Id céliri ndn potuit, he could not be 
kept ignorant of this; N. 7, 5, 2. 
  2. Two Accusatives are generally used with c616, doceG, édoces ; often 
with rog6, pdsc6, repdsc6, and sometimes with dédoceé, expéscé, fla- 
gitd ; cénsuld, interrog6, percontor, etc. 
3. Instead of the Accusative of the Thing verbs of Asking or Questioning 
generally take the Ablative with d&, c&16 sometimes takes the Ablative with 
dé, and doceé and €doced the Ablative with or without dé, an Infinitive 
lor a clause : 
Quem ego interrogem dé tiiribulis, whom I may question about the censers. 
Mé dé hoc libré célavit, he kept me ignorant of this book. Dé sua ré-mé 
docet, he informs me in regard to his case. Litteris Graecis doctus, instructed 
lin Greek literature. Sdcratem fidibus docuit, he taught Socrates to play on 
the lyre; C. Fam. 9,22. Té nihil sapere docuit, he taught you to know nothing. 
4, Quaeré, to ask, and verbs of Imploring and Demanding generally 
take the Accusative of the Thing and the Ablative of the Person with 4, ab, 
idé, 6, orex. In the passive the thing becomes the subject and the Abla- 
ive of the person is retained : 
Quaerit ex sold ea, ete., he asks him in private (from him alone) about 
those things ; Caes. 1,18. Pacem 4 vobis petimus, we implore peace from you; 
iL. 6,26. Id ab ed flagitabitur, this was earnestly demanded of him. 
412. The Accusative of a Neuter Pronoun or Adjective occurs 
in connection with a direct object with many verbs which other- 
vise seldom, if ever, take two Accusatives : 
Hoc té hortor, I give you this exhortation; C. ©. 1,5. Ea monémur, we 
uve admonished of these things; cf. C. Am, 24. Numquid aliud mé vis ? do you 
ish anything else of me ? Mlud té Ord, that I ask of you.

sative and an Infinitive : 
Ut doceam Rullum tacére, that I may teach Rullus to be silent; C. Agr. 8, 2 
Edocuit gentem cisiis aperire futiirds, he taught the race to disclose future 
events. Sentimus calére ignem, we perceive that fire is hot. Reégem tra 
dunt sé abdidisse, they relate that the king concealed himself; L.1, 31. 
1. In these examples observe that docuit and édocuit admit two Accu. 
satives and that the Infinitive here simply takes the place of one Accusative 
that Rullum and gentem are the objects of the finite verbs; that ignem| 
in the third example, may be explained either as the object of sentimus o: 
as the subject of the Infinitive, calére, we perceive fire to be hot or that fir 
is hot; and that the Accusative régem in the last example is plainly th 
subject of the Infinitive, abdidisse, that the king concealed himself. Thes 
examples illustrate the development of the subject of the Infinitive out o} 
the direct object of the principal verb. Hence we have the following rule. 
415. Rule. — Subject of Infinitive. —The Infinitive some: 
times takes an Accusative as its subject: 
Platdnem ferunt in Italiam vénisse, they report that Plato came into Italy 
C. Tuse. 1, 17, 89. Civitatis sapientissimum Soldnem dicunt fuisse, they sa 
that Solon was the wisest man of the state. 
Accusative of Specification 
416. Rule.—In poetry, rarely in prose, a verb or an adjec! 
tive may take an Accusative to Define its Application : 
Niibe umeros amictus, with his shoulders enveloped in a cloud; U. 1, 2, 3 
Miles fractus membra labore, the soldier with limbs shattered with labo
-P-A-G-E-211
  ACCUSATIVE 195 
(broken as to his limbs); H.8.1,1,5. Aenéas ds de6 similis, Aeneas like 
a god in countenance}; V.1, 589. 
1. This Accusative sometimes concurs with the Poetic Accusative after 
passive verbs used reflexively. Thus umerds above may be explained either 
as an Accusative of Specification or as the object of amictus used reflexively ; 
see 407. ; 
2. The Accusative is often used in an adverbial sense, developed largely 
from the Accusative of Specification and the Cognate Accusative, as multum, 
plirimum, cétera, reliqua, etc. ; partem, vicem, nihil, secus, aliquid, 
h6c, illud, id, etc. ; id aetatis, of that age; id temporis, at that time: 
Cétera ignarus populi Romani, in other respects ignorant of the Roman 
people; 8.19,7. Maximam partem lacte vivunt, they live mostly (as to the 
largest part) upon milk ; Caes. 4,1. Id hominibus id aetatis impdnitur, that is 
placed upon men of that age, i.e. of that time in life; C. Or. 1, 47, 207. Locus 
id temporis vacuus, a place at that time vacant; ©. Fin. 5, 1. 
8. Id genus, omne genus, and the like, apparently in the sense of ius 
generis, omnis generis, etc., are probably best explained as appositives: 
Aliquid id genus scribere, to write something of this kind (something, viz. 
this kind). 
Accusative of Time and Space 
417. Rule.— Duration of Time and Extent of Space are 
expressed by the Accusative: 
Romulus septem et triginta régnavit annds, Romulus reigned thirty- 
seven years; L. 1, 21,6 Cat6 annds quinque et octdginta natus excessit 
& vita, Cato died at the age of (haying been born) eighty-five years. Septin- 
genta milia passuum ambulare, to wall seven hundred miles. Aggerem 
altum pedés octdginta exstriixérunt, they erected a mound eighty feet high. 
1. Duration of Time is sometimes expressed by the Accusative with per: 
Per annés viginti certatum est, the contest was carried on for twenty years. 
2. Duration of Time sometimes so far coincides with time in or within 
which (487) that it is expressed by the Ablative : 
Pignaitum est héris quinque, the battle was fought five hours, or in five 
hours ; cf. Caes. ©. 1, 46. 
3. Distance regarded as Extent of Space is expressed by the Accusative 
as in the third and fourth examples, but regarded as the Measure of Differ- 
ence (479) it is expressed by the Ablative. Moreover, the Ablative of 
Distance sometimes takes 4, or ab:
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 SYNTAX 
Milibus passuum sex & Caesaris castris consédit, he encamped at the dis- 
tance of six. miles from Caesars camp; Caes.1,48. Ab milibus passuum 
dudbus castra posuérunt, they pitched their camp two miles off (at or from 
the distance of two miles); Caes. 2, 7, 3. 
4, In expressions of age with maior or minor, the Accusative may be 
used with natus or the Ablative with or without natus. 
Maior annos sexagint& niitus, more than sixty years old; N.21t,2, Minor 
quinque et viginti annis natus, less than twenty-five years old; N. 23,3. Maior 
annis quinquaginta, more than jifty years of age; L. 42, 88. 
Limit of Motion 
418. Rule. — The Place towards which the motion is 
directed as its End or Limit is generally denoted by the 
Accusative with ad or in, but in names of Towns by the 
Accusative alone: 
Legidnés ad urbem addiicit, he is leading the legions to or towards the city, 
©. Ph. 7,1. Hannibal exercitum in Italiam dixit, Hannibal led an army 
into Italy. Missi légati Athénas sunt, ambassadors were sent to Athens, 
L. 8,31. Reditus Romam, a return to Rome. Carthiginem Novam in 
hiberna Hannibal concessit, Hannibal retired into winter quarters at (lit. 
to) New Carthage ; L. 21. 15. 
1. The last example illustrates the fact that when a verb of motion takes 
two nouns denoting the limit of motion, both nouns must be in the Accusa- 
tive, even when the English idiom requires the use of at or in, in translating 
one of them: into winter quarters at New Carthage; Latin idiom, to New 
Carthage into winter quarters. 
2. Urbs or oppidum, with in, may stand before the name of a town, 
but if accompanied by a modifier, it regularly stands, with or without in, 
after such name: 
Pervénit in oppidum Cirtam, he came into the town Cirta; 8. 102. Sé con- 
tulit Tarquinids, in urbem Etriiriae, he betook himself to Tarquinii, a city of 
Etruria; cf.0.R.P.2,19. Capuam coldnia dédicétur, urbem amplissimam, 
a colony will be conducted to Capua, a very spacious city ; C. Agr. 2, 28. 
3. By a Latin idiom, verbs meaning ¢o collect, to come together, etc., — 
cdg6, convocd, congreg6, contrah6, convenid, advenié, pervenié, 
etc.,—are usually treated as verbs of Motion and accordingly take the Accusa- 
  
1 Originally the Limit of Motion was uniformly designated by the Accusative 
without a preposition. Names of towns have retained the original construction, 
while most other names of places have assumed a preposition.
-P-A-G-E-213
  ACOUSATIVE 197 
tive, with or without a preposition. On the contrary, verbs meaning to place, 
_—1oc6, collocs, p6n6, status, constitud, etc.,—are usually treated as 
verbs of Rest, and accordingly take the Ablative (483), generally with a 
preposition : 
Omnés in tinum locum cépias cdgere, to collect all the forces in one place ; 
Caes. 6,10. Omnés tinum in locum conveniunt, they all assemble in one place. 
Rdmam Italia tota convénit, all Italy assembled at Rome. Spem saliitis in 
virtiite ponébant, they all placed thetr hope of safety in their valor ; Caes. 5, 34. 
4, In the names of towns the Accusative with ad is used in the sense of 
to, towards, in the direction of, into the vicinity of, and in contrast with 4, 
or ab: 
Trés viae sunt ad Mutinam, there are three roads to Mutina; ©. Ph. 12,9. 
Ad Zamam pervénit, he came into the vicinity of Zama; 8.57. Ab Dianid 
ad Sindpén navigavérunt, they sailed from Dianium to Sinope; C. Ver. 1, 34, ST. 
419. Like names of towns, the following Accusatives are used 
without prepositions : 
1. Regularly domum, domés, ris, and Supines in um: 
Domum reductus est, he was conducted home; ©. Am. 3, 12. Alius alium 
domés suas invitant, they invite each other to their homes; 8. 66,8. Domum 
reditid, a return home ; ef. Caes. 1,5. Ego riis bd, I shall go into the country ; 
T, Eun. 216. Ad Caesarem congratulatum convénérunt, they came to Caesar 
to congratulate him } Caes. 1, 30. 
Nore. —A possessive, or a Genitive of the possessor, may accompany 
domum and domés, as domum Caesaris, to Caesars house; domds 
suas, to their homes. With other modifiers a preposition is regularly used, 
as in illam domum, into that house. 
2. Sometimes the Accusative of names of Islands and Peninsulas, and 
even of Countries: 
Latona cénfigit Délum, Latona fled to Delos; of. ©. Ver. 1,18. Miltiadés 
pervénit Chersonésum, Miltiades went to the Chersonesus; N.1,1. Dicitur 
Aegyptum profigisse, he is said to have fled to Egypt; 0. N. D, 8, 22. 
8. In poetry and late prose, the preposition is often omitted before 
the names of Countries and Nations and sometimes even before com- 
mon nouns: 
Ttaliam vénit, he came to Italy; V.1, 2. Nos tbimus Afrés, we shall go to 
the Africans; V. E. 1, 65. Lavina vénit litora, he came to the Lavinian 
shores; V. 1,2. Ile infitias ibit, he is going to deny it (to a denial of it) ; 
T. Ad, 889,  
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 SYNTAX 
4. A Poetical Dative occurs for the Accusative : 
it clamor cael6, the shout ascends to Heaven; V. 5, 451. Dum inferret 
deds Latid, while he was carrying his gods to Latium; V.1, 6. Facilis dé- 
scénsus Avern6, easy is the descent to Avernus; V. 6, 126. 
     
Nore. — See also Dative in Poetry and late Prose, 428. 
Accusative with Prepositions 
420. Rule.— The Accusative may take a Preposition to 
aid in expressing the exact relation intended : 
Scribam ad té, I shall write to you. Ad té ante liicem veniet, he will 
come to you before light. Tnsula contra Brundisium est, the island is oppo- 
site Brundisium. Post mé erat Aegina, behind me was Aegina. Insulae 
propter Siciliam, the islands near Sicily. Secundum natiiram vivere, to 
live in accordance with nature. 
1. Note the force of, the prepositions in the following expressions: ad 
urbem, ¢o the city; in urbem, into the city; per urbem, through the city ; 
post urbem, behind the city ; prope urbem, near the city. 
2. The following prepositions are used with the Accusative alone : 
ad, to contra, opposite pone, behind 
adversus, i ergi, towards post, behind opposite pee . adversum, extra, outside praeter, beyond 
ante, before infra, below prope, near 
apud, near, at inter, among propter, on account of 
circa, eT intra, inside secundum, neat after 5 youn es . circum, iixta, near supra, above 
circiter, about ob, on account of trans, across 
cis, Bicks enes, in power oj ultra. beyond Ait } on this side PON OP t » a citra, per, through versus, towards 
3. The following four prepositions are used either with the Accusa- 
tive or with the Ablative : 
in, into, in subter, beneath, under, towards 
sub, under super, above, about, beyond 
in and sub with the Accusative after verbs of motion; subter and super 
generally with the Accusative : 
Hannibal exercitum in Italiam dixit, Hannibal led an army into Italy ; 
N. 23, 3. Sub montem succédunt, they approached towards the mountain. 
Subter mirds hostium Avehitur, he ts borne under the walls of the enemy. 
Super Numidiam esse, to be beyond Numidia ; 8. 19, 5. 
Nore. — For the Ablative with these four prepositions, see 490, 3.
-P-A-G-E-215
ACCUSATIVE 199 
4. Prepositions were originally adverbs (812, 1) and many of them are 
still used as adverbs in classical authors : 
Ad milibus quattuor, about four thousand. Legid iixta cdnstiterat, the 
legion had taken a stand near by. Prope & Sicilia, not far (near) from 
Sicily. Supra, infra mundés esse, that there are worlds above and below. 
5. Conversely, several words which are generally adverbs, sometimes 
become prepositions and are used with the Accusative: propius, nearer ; 
jproximé, nearest ; pridié, the day before ; postridié, the day after; clam, 
clanculum, without the knowledge of ; tisque, as far as, even to: 
Propius periculum, nearer to danger; L.21,1,2. Quam proximé Italiam, 
as near as possible to Italy; ©. Ph. 10, 11. Pridié eum diem, the day before 
that day ; ©. Att. 11,23. Postridié lidds, the day after the games; ©. Att. 16.4, 
Clam patrem, without father’s knowledge; V. Hee. 396. Usque pedés, even to 
the feet ; Curt. 8, 9. 
Nore. —For the rare use of the Ablative after clam, see 490, 4. 
Accusative in Exclamations 
421. Rule.— The Accusative, either with or without an 
interjection, may be used in Exclamations : 
Heu mé miserum, Ah me unhappy1; ©. Ph.7,4. Mé miserum, me miser- 
able1; ©. Att.9,6. O fallacem spem, O deceptive hope. Pro dedrum fidem, 
in the name of the gods.? 
1. An adjective or a Genitive generally accompanies this Accusative, as 
in the examples. 
2. Instead of the Accusative, the Vocative may be used when an Address 
as well as an exclamation is intended: 
Infélix Didd, unhappy Dido. 
3. The Nominative may be used when the exclamation approaches the 
form of a statement : 
En dextra fidésque, Jo the right hand and the plighted faith; Y. 4, 591. 
Ecce tuae litterae, lo your letter ; C. Att. 13, 16, 1. 
  4, The Ethical Dative is used in exclamations after ei, vae, ecce, and a 
few other interjections ; see 482: 
Ei mihi, quid faciam, woe to me, what shall I do? 1. Ad. 789. 
  
1 See Milton, Paradise Lost, IV. 73. 
2 Some of the Accusatives found in exclamations are readily explained as the 
object of omitted verbs, while others may be the survival of rude unfinished 
sentences from a primitive age.

DATIVE 
422. The Dative is used as follows: 
As Indirect Object — General Use; see 424. 
With Special Verbs; see 426. 
With Certain Compound Verbs; see 429. 
As Possessor; see 480. 
As Apparent Agent; see 481.

Indirect Object 
423. The Indirect Object designates the Person To or For 
Whom, or the Thing To or For Which, anything is or is done. 
Dative with Verbs 
424. Rule. — The Indirect Object of an action is put in 
the Dative. It may be used either alone or in connection 
with the Direct Object : 
Mundus Ded paret, the world is subject to God. ‘Tibi seris, tibt metés, 
for yourself you sow, for yourself you will reap. Ego Caesari supplicabo, 
I shall supplicate Caesar. Peciiniae serviunt, they are slaves to money. 
Vita vobis data est, life has been granted to you, C. Ph. 14, 12. 
Militibus signum dedit, he gave the signal to the soldiers. Tibi gratias 
agimus, we give you thanks. Natira hominem conciliat homini, nature 
reconciles man to man. Légés civitatibus suis scrips¢runt, they wrote laws 
for their states ; C. Leg. 2, 6. 
    
  1. The Indirect Object generally designates a Person, or something Per- 
sonified, as in the examples. 
2. The Dative of the Indirect Object must be distinguished from the 
Accusative, with or without a preposition, denoting the Limit of Motion, 
and from the Ablative with pré, meaning for, in defense of, in behalf of. 
Compare the following examples : 
Patriam nobis reddidistis, you have restored our country to us. Missi 
légiti Athénas sunt, envoys were sent to Athens. Convenit dimicare pro 
patria, it is seemly to fight for one’s country.
-P-A-G-E-217
r DATIVE 201 
8. The force of the Dative is often found only by attending to the strict 
literal meaning of the verb: niib6, to marry (strictly, to veil one’s self, as 
the bride for the bridegroom); medeor, to cure (to administer a remedy to): 
Venus niipsit Vuleainé, Venus married Vulcan; 0. N. D. 3, 23. 
425. The Dative of the Indirect Object may be 
1. The Dative of Influence, generally designating the Person ‘To 
Whom, sometimes the Thing To Which, something is or is done: 
Civitatibus libertatem reddidit, he restored liberty to the states. 
Here belong most of the examples under the rule. 
2. The Dative of Interest,! designating the Person For Whom some- 
thing is done: 
Non nobis sdlum nati sumus, we were not born for ourselves alone. Non 
sdlum nébis divités esse volumus, sed liberis, we wish to be rich, not for our 
selves alone, but for our children ; C. Off. 8, 15. 
3. The Dative of Purpose or End, designating the Object or End For 
Which something is or is done: 
Receptui cecinit, he gave the signal for a retreat; cf. L. 34,39. Non scholae 
sed vitae discimus, we learn, not for the school, but for life; Sen. Ep. 105. 
4. The Dative of Relation, designating the Person In Relation To 
Whom, or In Reference To Whom, something is or is done: 
  Ti illi pater es, you are a father to him; T. Ad. 126. Tridui iter expeditis 
erat, it was a journey of three days for light-armed soldiers; L. 9,9. Est 
urbe égressis tumulus, here is a mound as you go out of the city (to those 
having [= who have] gone out of the city); V. 2, 712. 
Norr.—A Dative is sometimes thus added to the predicate when the 
English idiom would lead us to expect a Genitive depending on a noun: 
Sésé CaesarI ad pedés prodiécérunt, they threw themselves at the fect of 
Caesar ; Ones. 1, 31. Urbi fundamenta iéci, I laid the foundations of (for) 
the city; L.1,12. Mihi horror membra quatit, @ shudder shakes my limbs; 
V. 3, 29. 
426. With Special Verbs.— The Dative of the Indirect Object 
is used with many verbs which require special mention. Thus, 
1. With verbs meaning to please or displease, command or obey, serve or 
resist, benefit or injure, favor or oppose, trust or distrust, and the like:   
1 Observe that the Dative of Influence is very closely connected with the verb, 
and is, in fact, essential to the completeness of the sentence; while the Dative of 
Interest and the Dative of Purpose are merely added to sentences which would be 
complete without them. Thus Divités esse volumus is complete in itself.

DATIVE 203 
5. With scrib6, to write, and mitt6, to send, the Person may be denoted

Nore. — Dare litteras alicui generally means to deliver a letter to some

Litterfis ad té numquam habui cui darem, I have never had any one bu 
whom to send (lit. to whom I might deliver) a letter to you; C. Fam. 12, 19.

Atticus Athéniénsés frimentd donavit, Atticus presented the Athenians with 
grain; of. N. 25, 2.

of the Thing, sometimes with dé, but the Accusative also occurs : 
Omni Gallia Romanis interdixit, he forbade the Romans all Gaul. 
427. A Dative rendered from or with sometimes occurs where 
our idiom would lead us to expect the Ablative, as with verbs of

times with facid, misced, ete. 
Sibi dissentire, to dissent from himself. Sibi discrepantés, disagreeing

praeerat, Dumnorix commanded the cavalry. <Aetas succédit aetati, age 
succeeds age. Neque superesse rei piblicae volé, nor do I wish to survive 
the republic. 
  1. Transitive verbs thus compounded take both the Accusative and “the 
Dative, as in the second and fifth examples, and in the passive they retain 
the Dative, as in the third example. 
2. Compounds of other prepositions, especially of ab, ex, and circum, 
sometimes admit the Dative ; while several of the compounds specified under 
the rule admit the Ablative with or without a preposition : 
Sibi libertatem abiiidicat, he condemns himself to the loss of liberty ; 
ef. ©. Caec. 34. Tune mihi timdrem éripe, take away from (for) me this fear; 
c.C.1,7. Hominés labore assuéti, men habituated to (familiarized with) 
labor; ©. Or. 8, 15. Dicta cum factis composuit, he compared words with 
deeds ; 8. 48. 
8. Motion, Direction. —Compounds expressing mere motion or direction 
generally take the Accusative with or without a preposition :
-P-A-G-E-221
ee ee ee eS ee ee ae ee Se 
DATIVE 205 
Héréditatem adire, to enter on an inheritance. Consulatus ad omne peri- 
culum opponitur, the consulship is exposed to every danger. 
4, Several compounds admit either the Accusative or the Dative without 
any special difference of meaning: 
‘Tuscus ager Romand adiacet, the Tuscan territory borders on the Roman ; 
L. 2, 49,9. Mare illud adiacent, they are near that sea; N. 13,2. Quibus timor 
incesserat, whom fear had seized; 8.0.81. Timor patrés incessit, fear seized 
the fathers ; L. 1, 17. 
5. Some of these compounds admit the Dative in poetry, though in classical 
prose the Accusative or Ablative, with or without a preposition, is more 
common :   
Contendis Homéré,! you contend with Homer; Prop.1,7;8. Animis! illa- 
bere nostris, inspire (descend into) our souls; V. 8, 89. 
6. Instead of the compounds of ad, ante, etc., the poets sometimes use 
the simple verbs with the Dative: 
Qui haeserat Euandr6, who had joined himself to Evander ; V. 10, 780. 
430. The Dative of the Possessor is used with the verb sum: 
Est mihi domi pater, £ have (there is to me) a father at home. Sex filii 
nobis sunt, we have six sons. Fonti nomen Arethiisa est, the name of the 
(to the) fountain is Arethusa ; ef. 0. Ver. 4, 58. 
1. The Dative of the name, as well as of the possessor, is common in 
expressions of naming : 
Scipiéni Africind cogndmen fuit, Scipio had the surname Africanus; 
cf. 8.5, 4. Here AfricanG, instead of being in apposition with c6gndmen, 
is put by attraction in apposition with Scipiéni. 
2. By a Greek idiom, voléns, cupiéns, or invitus sometimes accom- 
panies the Dative of the Possessor : 
Quibus bellum yolentibus erat, who liked the war (to whom wishing the 
war was) ; Tac. Agr. 18. 
    431. The Dative of the Apparent Agent is used with the Ge- 
rundive and with the Passive Periphrastic Conjugation: 
Dicenda Misis proelia, battles to be sung by the muses; H. 4, 9,21. Suum 
cuique incommodum ferendum est, every one has his own trouble to bear - 
©. Off. 8, 6, 80. 
  
1 Prose construction, cum HomérG and in animés.
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 ‘ SYNTAX 
1. Instead of the Dative of the Apparent Agent, the Ablative with 4 or ab 
is sometimes used : 
Quibus est 4 vobis! cOnsulendum, for whom measures must be taken by you; 
C. Man. 2. 
2. The Dative of the Apparent Agent is sometimes used with the com- 
pound tenses of Passive Verbs . 
Mihi consilium captum iam dif est, I have a plan long since formed ; 
©. Fam. 5, 19. 
3. Habe6 with the Perfect Participle has the same force as est mihi 
with the Participle: 
Peciinias collocatas habent, they have moneys invested ; ©. Man. 7,18. Equi- 
tatum coactum habébat, he had collected his cavalry or had his cavalry col- 
lected ; Caes. 1, 15. 
Nore. —The Dative with the Gerundive, whether alone or in the Peri- 
phrastic Conjugation, designates the person who has the work to do ; while 
with the compound tenses of passive verbs it designates the person who has 
the work already done. 
4. The Real Agent, with passive verbs, in classical prose is denoted by the 
Ablative with 4 or ab?; see 468. 
5. The Dative is used with the tenses for incomplete action, to designate 
the person who is at once Agent and Indirect Object, the person by whom 
and for (to) whom the action is performed : 
Honesta bonis viris quaeruntur, honorable things are sought by good men; 
©. Off. 3, 9. 
6. In the poets, the Dative is often used for the Ablative, with 4 or ab, 
to designate simply the agent of the action: 
Neque cernitur illi, nor is he seen by any one; V. 1, 440. Nilla tua- 
rum audita mihi sordrum, no one of your sisters has been heard by 
me; V. 1, 236. Régnata arva Saturnd quondam, lands formerly ruled by 
Saturn ; V. 6, 798. 
  
1 Here & vObis is necessary to distinguish the Agent from the Indirect Object, 
quibus; but the Ablative with & or ab is sometimes used when this necessity 
does not exist. 
2 The Dative with the Gerundive is best explained as the Dative of Possessor 
or of the Indirect Object. Thus, suum cuique incommodum est means every 
one has his trouble (cuique, Dative of Possessor) and suum cuique incom- 
modum ferendum est, every one has his trouble to bear. So, too, mihi c6n- 
silium est, I have a plan; mihi cdnsilium captum est, 1 have a plan 
(already) formed.
-P-A-G-E-223
DATIVE 207 
432. The Ethical Dative, denoting the person to whom the 
thought is of special interest, is often introduced into the Latin 
sentence! in the form of a personal pronoun : 
At tibi venit ad mé, but lo, he comes to me; C. Fam. 9,2. Quod mihi abis, 
whither are you going, pray? V.5, 162. Quid mihi Celsus agit, what is my 
Celsus doing ? Quid vobis vultis, what do you wish or mean? Ei mihi, 
quid faciam, woe to me, what shall I do? '. Ad. 789. 
Two Datives 
433. Rule. — Two Datives, the Object To Which and the 
Object or End For Which, are used with a few verbs, either 
alone or in connection with the Direct Object: 
Vobis hondri estis, you are an honor (for an honor) to yourselves ; 
ef. ©. Or. 1, 8, 84. Est mihi magnae ciirae, it is of (for) great interest to 
me; ©, Fin. 8, 2,8. Odid sum Romanis, J am an object of hatred to the 
Romans; L. 35, 19, 6. Id mihi est cordi, this is pleasing (for my heart) to 
me; C. Am. 4,15. Venit Atticis auxilid, he came to the assistance of the 
Athenians; N. 8, 8,1. Hoe illi tribuébatur ignaviae, this was imputed to 
him as cowardice ; ©. Fam. 2, 16, 8. 
Quinque cohortés castris praesidid relinquit, he leaves five cohorts for 
the defense of the camp; Caes.7, 60. Periclés agrds suds dono rei publicae 
dedit, Pericles gave his lands to the republic as a present; Tust. 8, 7. 
1. The Dative of the object or end is a Predicate Dative. Thus in the 
first example the predicate is honGri estis ; see Predicate Nominative (893) 
and Predicate Accusative (410, 1). 
2. The verbs which take two Datives are Intiansitive verbs signifying to 
be, become, go, and the like: sum, fi6, etc., and Transitive verbs signifying 
to give, send, leave, impute, regard, choose, and the like: 46, d6n6, diicd, 
habe6, mitté, relinquG, tribuG, verts, etc. The latter take in the active 
two Datives with an Accusative ; but in the passive two Datives only, as the 
direct object of the active becomes the subject of the passive ; see 404, 2. 
3. One of the Datives is often omitted, or its place supplied by a Predicate 
Nominative, or by ad with the Accusative: 
Navés niilld tisui fuérunt, the ships were of no use; Caes. 0.2,%,1. Ta illi 
pater es, you are a father to him; T. Ad. 126. 
  
1 Compare the following from Shakespeare: ‘He plucked me ope his doublet 
and offered them his throat to cut’ (Julius Caesar, Act I., Scene II.). ‘He pres- 
ently steps me a little higher’ (Henry IV., Part I., Act IV., Scene III.).
-P-A-G-E-224
  208 SYNTAX 
4, With audiéns two Datives sometimes occur, dicté dependent upon 
audiéns, and a personal Dative dependent upon dict6 audiéns, and some- 
times dicté oboediéns is used like dict6 audiéns : 
Nobis dictd audientés sunt, they are obedient to us; C. Ver. 5,32. Magistré 
dictd oboediéns, obedient to his master ; Pl. Bac. 439. 
Dative with Adjectives 
434. Rule. — Many adjectives take the Dative as the In- 
direct Object of the quality denoted by them: 
Td militibus fuit iicundum, this was agreeable to the soldiers. Mihi dif- 
ficile est dicere, it is difficult for me to speak. Atticus amicissimus Brito, 
Aiticus most friendly to Brutus. Canis similis lupo, a dog similar to a wolf. 
Proximus sum egomet mihi, J am nearest of kin to myself. Locus castris 
idoneus, a place suitable for the camp. Id causae est aliénum, this is foreign 
to the case. Universae Gracciae iitile, useful for all Greece. Initilés sunt 
belld, they are useless for war. 
  1. The Indirect Object of an Adjective, like the Indirect Object of a Verb, 
generally answers the question to or for whom? or to or for what? See ex- 
amples. 
2. Adjectives which take the Dative are chiefly those meaning agreeable, 
dear, easy, faithful, friendly, like, near, necessary, suitable, useful, together 
with others of a similar or opposite meaning,! and with verbals in ilis and 
bilis. 
3. Idem, like adjectives of likeness, admits the Dative : 
Non idem illis cénsére, not to think the same as they; ef. C. Fam. 9,6. Idem 
facit occidenti, he does the same as he who kills ; UW. A. P. 
  435. Other constructions sometimes occur where the learner 
would expect the Dative: 
1. The Accusative with a Preposition: in, erga, adversus, with adjec- 
tives signifying friendly, hostile, etc., and ad, to denote the Object or End 
For Which, with adjectives signifying useful, suitable, inclined, etc.: 
Perindulgéns in patrem, very kind to his father ; 0. Off. 3,31. Multas ad rés 
perittilés, very useful for many things; 0. Sen. 17. 
  
  1Such are accommoditus, aequalis, aligénus, amicus, inimicus, aptus, carus, 
facilis, difficilis, fidélis, infidélis, finitimus, gratus, iddneus, iiicundus, iniieundus, 
molestus, nec jus, notus, igndtus, noxius, par, dispar, pernicidsus, propinquus, 
proprius, salitaris, similis, dissimilis, diversus, vicinus, etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
GENITIVE 209 
2. The Accusative with propior, proximus!; 
Propior montem, nearer the mountain. Proximus mare, nearest the sea. 
8. The Ablative with or without a Preposition : 
Himani nil 4 mé alignum puto, I consider nothing human foreign to me; 
T, Heaut. 77. Homine aliénissimum, most foreign to or from man ; ©. Off. 1, 18. 
4, The Genitive with adjectives meaning like, unlike, belonging to, char- 
acteristic of, and a few others? : 
Cri similis esse voluit, he wished to be like Cyrus; C. Brut. 81, Populi 
Romani est propria libertés, liberty is characteristic of the Roman people; 
©. Ph. 6, 7, 19. 
Nore, — With similis Plautus and Terence use only the Genitive ; Ovid, 
Horace, and Vergil generally the Dative; Cicero generally the Dative of 
persons and either the Genitive or Dative of things. 
Dative with Nouns and Adverbs 
436. Rule. —'The Dative is used with a few special nouns 
and adverbs derived from primitives which take the Dative: 
Tastitia est obtemperatid légibus, justice is obedience to the laws; 
C. Leg. 1,15. Opulent6 homini servitiis diva est, serving a rich man is 
hard; Pl. Amph. 166, Congruenter natiirae vivere, to live in accord with 
nature; ©. Fin. 8,7. Proximé hostium castris, nearest to the camp of the 
enemy; Caes. C. 1, 72. 
1. The Dative occurs with a few nouns and adverbs not thus derived : 
Tribiinicia potestis, miinimentum libertati, tribunician power, a defense 
for liberty; cf. L. 8, 87. 
2. For the Dative of Gerundives with Official Names, see 627, 2. 
GENITIVE 
437. The Genitive in its ordinary use corresponds to the Eng- 
lish possessive, or the objective with of, and expresses various 
adjective relations. Indeed, many Genitives and adjectives are 
so entirely synonymous that they are often used the one for the 
other. Thus belli itis and bellicum itis, the right of war, are often 
equivalent expressions. 
  
1 Like the Accusative after propius and proximé; see 420, 5. 
2 As similis, dissimilis, assimilis, cOnsimilis, par, dispar; adfinis; proprius, 
Sacer; contrarius, insuétus, superstes, etc. : 
HARK. LAT, GRAM. — 15  
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 SYNTAX 
1. The Genitive is used chiefly to qualify or limit nouns and adjectives, 
but it is also sometimes used with verbs and adverbs, especially with those in 
which the substantive idea is prominent. 
438. The Genitive is used as follows: Ee As Attributive and Predicate Genitive, — General use; see 489. 
As Subjective and Objective Genitive; see 440. 
As Partitive Genitive; see 441. 
In Special Constructions; see 445. 
As Predicate Genitive of Price and Value; see 448. 
As Predicate Genitive with Réfert and Interest; see 449. 
As Objective Genitive with Adjectives; see 450. 
As Objective Genitive with Verbs; see 454-458. SAaaPey 
Genitive with Nouns 
439. Rule. — A noun used as an Attributive or Predicate 
of another noun denoting a different person or thing is put 
in the Genitive : 
Attributive Genitives. — Xenophontis libri, the books of Xendphon. 
Propter metum poenae, on account of fear of punishment. Vir codnsilii 
magni, a man of great prudence. Hérodotus, pater historiae, Herodotus, 
the father of history. listitia est régina virtiitum, Justice is the queen of 
virtues. 
Predicate Genitives. — Omnia hostium erant, all things were in the pos- 
session of (were of) the enemy; L. 6, 40,17. Tiidicis est vérum sequi, to 
follow the truth is the duty of a judge. Magni erunt mihi tuae litterae, 
your letters will be of great value to me; C. Fam. 15, 15, 4. 
1. For a noun predicated of another noun denoting the same person or 
thing, see 393. 
2. For the Predicate Dative, see 483, 1. 
3. A Predicate Genitive is often nearly or quite equivalent to a Predicate 
Adjective (382, 2): hominis est = himanum est, tis the mark of a man, 
is human; stulti est = stultum est, it is foolish. ‘The Genitive is the 
vegular construction in adjectives of one ending: sapientis est, it is the 
part of a wise man, is wise. 
4, The Predicate Genitive of personal pronouns is not in good use, but 
its place is supplied by possessives in agreement with the subject —an illus- 
tration of the close relationship between predicate Genitives and predicate 
adjectives. Compare the following examples:  
-P-A-G-E-227
eee ee ee 
GENITIVE © 211 
Est tuum vidére quid agatur, i¢ is your duty (yours) to see what ts being 
) done ; ©. Mur, 38, 83. Est consulis vidére quid agatur, it is the duty of (is of) 
the consul to see what is being done; C. Mur. 2, 4. 
5. The Predicate Genitive is sometimes supplied by a Genitive depending 
on a noun or adjective, meaning mark, duty, part, business, characteris- 
tic, ete.: 
Id viri est officium, this is the part of a man; in C. Tuse. 2, 21, Est pro- 
prium stultitiae, alisrum vitia cernere, it is characteristic of folly to perceive 
the faults of others ; ©. Tuse. 8, 80. 
Attributive Genitive 
440. The Attributive Genitive may be 
1. A Subjective Genitive, designating the Subject or Agent of an 
action and the Author or Possessor of anything: 
In serméne hominum, in the conversation of men. Dedrum immortalium 
cara, by the care of the immortal gods. Lamentatidnem matrum perhor- 
réscd, I shudder at the lamentation of mothers. Xenophdntis libri, the books 
of Xenophon. 
Nore 1.— That this Genitive really represents the subject of the action is 
readily seen if we express the implied action in the form of a sentence: the 
conversation of men, men converse; the lamentation of mothers, mothers 
lament. 
Nore 2.— Possessives are regularly used for the subjective Genitive of 
personal pronouns: mea domus, my house ; nostra patria, our country. 
2. An Objective Genitive, designating the Object towards which the 
action or feeling is directed : 
Meus amor gloriae, my love of glory. Créscit amor nummi, the love of 
money increases. Tui sui memoria délectatur, he is delighted with your 
recollection of him; ©. Att. 18, 1, 3. 
Nore 1.—For the objective Genitive, the Accusative with in, erga, or 
adversus is sometimes used: odium patris in filium, the father’s hatred 
against his son; odium erga R6man6s, hatred of or towards the Romans. 
Nore 2.— The Possessive occurs, though rarely, for the objective Genitive 
of personal pronouns: neque neglegentia tua neque odid tud, neither 
Srom disregard of you nor from hatred of you; ¥. Ph. 1016. 
3. A Descriptive Genitive, or Genitive of Characteristic, designating 
character or quality, including value, price, size, weight, age, ete. It is 
generally accompanied by an adjective or some other modifier : 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 “| SYNTAX 
Vir magnae auctoritatis, a man of great influence. Mitis ingenii iuvenis, 
a youth of mild disposition. Vestis magni pretii, a garment of great value. 
Corona parvi ponderis, a crown of small weight. Exsilium decem anndrum, 
an exile of ten years. a 
Norse 1,—For the Predicate Genitive of Price, see 448. 
Nore 2.— For the Ablative of Characteristic, see 478, 2. 
4. A Defining or Appositional Genitive, having the general force of 
an appositive (393): 
Virtiis continentiae, the virtue of self-control. Tellis Ausoniae, the land 
of Ausonia. Nomen carendi, the word want (of wanting); ©. Tuse. 1,36. VOx 
voluptatis, the word pleasure ; ©. Fin. 2, 2, 6. 
5. A Partitive Genitive, designating the whole of which a part is taken : 
Pars fliminis Rhéni, a part of the river Rhine. Quis vestrum, which of 
you? Omnium sapientissimus, the wisest of all men. Nihil boni, nihil mali, 
nothing (of) good, nothing bad; ©. Am. 4, 
Norz.— The Partitive Genitive, though generally a noun or pronoun, may 
be an adjective used substantively in the Genitive singular of the Second 
Declension, as boni, mali. Adjectives of the Third Declension, on the con- 
trary, regularly agree with the partitive word, but in rare instances they are 
attracted into the Genitive by another Partitive Genitive: 
Quicquam, non dicé civilis, sed hiimani, anything, I do ot say civil, but 
human ; L. 5.8. 
441. The Partitive Genitive is common with nouns and pro- 
nouns used partitively : h 
Maxima pars hominum, most men (the largest part of). Magno cum pon- 
dere auri, with a large quantity of gold. Montés auri pollicéns, promising 
mountains of gold. Unus quisque nostrum, every one of us. Consulun: 
alter, one of the consuls. Aliquid consiliil, any wisdom (anything of wisdom}. 
Id temporis, that (of) time. 
442. The Partitive Genitive is also common with numerals? and 
adjectives used substantively, especially with comparatives and 
superlatives ; 
Mille misit militum, he sent a thousand soldiers. Quattuor milia equitum, 
four thousand (of) cavalry. Horum omnium fortissimi, the bravest of all 
these. Prior hdrum in proelid cecidit, the former of these fell in battle; 
N.21,1,2. Aetatis extrémum, the end of life; 8. 90,1. 
    
1 For the construction of tinus, see 444, 1.
-P-A-G-E-229
GENITIVE 213 
1. Pronouns and Adjectives, except neuters, when used with the Partitive 
Genitive usually take the gender of the Genitive, but Predicate Superlatives, 
when thus used, generally agree with the subject : 
Quis edrum nén égregius, who of them is not eminent? Sapientum 
octavus, the eighth of the wise men; H.8. 2, 3,296. Indus est omnium flimi- 
num maximus, the Indus is the largest of all rivers; C. N. D. 2, 52. 
Here observe that quis and octavus take the gender of the Genitive, but 
that the superlative maximus agrees with the subject. 
2. In the best prose, words meaning the whole do not admit the Partitive 
Genitive, but poets and late writers disregard the rule: 
Omnés omnium drdinum hominés, all men of all ranks. Cuncta terrarum, 
all lands ; 11. 2,1, 23. Macedonum omnés, all the Macedonians ; ef. L. 81, 45, 7. 
Observe that in the first example, the adjectives are used regularly in 
agreement with their nouns, while in the last two they are used substan- 
tively and take the Partitive Genitive, though the partitive idea has entirely 
disappeared and the construction is partitive only in form. 
38. In the best prose the Partitive Genitive is rarely used after any adjec- 
tives except comparatives and superlatives, but in the poets and late writers 
the use of this Genitive is greatly extended : 
Sancte dedrum, thou holy god; V.4, 576. Diérum féstds, festal days; 
IL. 8.2, 2,60. Strata viérum = stratae viae, the paved streets; V. 1, 422. Ad 
multum diéi, ¢ild late in the day; Liv. 22, 45.   
4, With Nouns, quisque, each, every, and uterque, each, both, generally 
agree as adjectives, but with Pronouns they are generally used substantively 
and take the Partitive Genitive, though in the case of uterque, agreement is 
not uncommon : 
Quisque imperator, every commander. Uterque exercitus, each army. Quis- 
que edrum dé quaque ré, each one of them in regard to every thing ; Caes. 4, 5. 
Utrique nostrum gratum, acceptable to each of us; ©. Am, 4,16. His utrisque 
persuaserant, they had persuaded both of these ; Caes. 2, 16. 
5. The Neuter of Pronouns and Adjectives with the Partitive Genitive is 
sometimes used of Persons: 
Quicquid erat patrum, whatever (of) senators there were ; L. 2,85. Dedram 
quicquid régit terras, whatever gods rule the world; H. Ep. 5,1. Quid hie 
tantum hominum incédunt, why are so many men (so much of men) coming 
this way ? Pl. Poen. 619. 
443. The Partitive Genitive is also used with a few Adverbs, 
especially with Adverbs of Quantity, Degree, and Place: 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  214 SYNTAX 
Satis Gloquentiae, sapientiae parum, enough of eloquence, of wisdom too 
little ; 8. 0.5,4. Liicis habent nimis, they have too much light; 0. F. 6, 115. 
Maximé omnium nobilium Graecis litteris studuit, of all the nobles he most 
devoted himself to Greek letters; C. Brut. 20,78. Ubinam gentium sumus, 
where in the world are we ? C. 0.1, 4, 9. 
444. Instead of the Partitive Genitive, the Accusative with 
ante, inter, or apud, or the Ablative with ex, dé, or in, is often 
used, especially when the Whole is denoted by a cardinal number, 
or by a noun in the singular : 
Thalés sapientissimus in septem fuit, Thales was the wisest of the seven; 
C. Leg. 2, 11,26. Quis ex tanta multitiidine, who of so great a multitude? 
Ante alids pulcherrimus omnés, most beautiful of all (before all others). 
Apud Helvétids ditissimus, the richest among the Helvetii. 
1. In the best prose, inus is generally followed by the Ablative with ex 
or dé, but sometimes by the Partitive Genitive: inus ex summis viris, 
one of the greatest of heroes; inus dé multis, one of the multitude; tnus 
edrum pontium, one of those bridges. 
> 
Genitive in Special Constructions 
445. The word upon which the Attributive Genitive depends is 
often omitted : 
1. Especially when it has been expressed with a preceding Genitive. 
Then the second Genitive is sometimes attracted into the case appropriate 
for the governing word: 
Conferre vitam Trebdni cum Dolabellae, to compare the life of Trebonius 
with that of Dolabella; C.Ph.11,4,9. Natira hominis béluis antecédit, the 
nature of man surpasses (that of) the brutes ; ef. C. Off. 1, 80. 
2. When it can be readily supplied, especially aedés, or templum 
after a preposition, as ad, ante, 4, or ab: 
Habitabat réx ad Iovis, the king resided near the temple of Jupiter; 
L.1,41. Hannibal anndrum novem, Hannibal, (a boy) nine years of age; 
L. 21,1, Aberant bidui (viam), they were two days’ journey distant ; O. Att.5. 16. 
446. Observe also the following constructions: 
1. The Genitive of a Proper Name seems to depend directly on an- 
other proper noun in many cases in which we supply the word son, 
daughter, husband, wife, or slave:
-P-A-G-E-231
  
GENITIVE 215 
Hasdrubal Giscdnis, Gisco’s Hasdrubal, i.e., Hasdrubal, Gisco’s son; 
L. 28,12. Hectoris Andromaché, Hector’s Andromache, i.e., Hector’s wife; 
v.8,819. Hiius vided Byrriam, I see his Byrria, i.e., his slave Byrria; 
T. And. 357. 
2. Two Genitives are sometimes used with the same noun, one sub- 
jective, the other objective or descriptive. To these a third Genitive is 
occasionally added : 
Helvétidrum initiriae populi R6mani, the wrongs done by the Helvetii to the 
Roman people ; cf. Caes. 1,30. Memmi odium potentiae nobilitatis, Memmius’s 
hatred of the power of the nobility ; cf. 8. 30. 
3. A Genitive sometimes accompanies a Possessive, especially the 
Genitive of ipse, sdlus, inus, or omnis: 
Ad tuam ipsius amicitiam, to your own friendship; C.Ver.3,4,7. Mea 
inius opera, by my aid alone; ©. Pis. 3,6. Tuum studium aduléscentis, your 
devotion as a young man; C. Fam. 15, 13. 
4. The Genitive is used with instar meaning likeness, image, but 
generally used in the sense of, as large as, of the size of, equal to: 
Instar montis equum aedificant, they construct a horse of the size of a 
mountain; V.2,15. Platd instar est omnium, Plato is worth them all; 
©. Brut, 51, 191. 
5. The Genitive is used with pridié, postridié, ergd, and tenus, 
nouns in origin, and as such governing the Genitive; pridié and postri- 
dié are Locatives: 
Pridié Gius diéi, on the day before that day; Caes.1, 47. Postridié éius dizi, 
on the day after that day. Virtiitis ergd, on the ground of merit. Urbium 
Corcyrae tenus, as far as the cities of Corcyra; L. 26, 24. 
Predicate Genitive 
447. The Predicate Genitive is generally Subjective or De- 
scriptive, rarely Partitive. When used with transitive verbs, it 
is of course combined with the Direct Object. It is most common 
with sum and facid, but it also occurs with verbs of Seeming, 
Regarding, Valuing, ete. : 
Est imperatoris superare, to conquer is the business of a commander; 
Caes. C. 1,72. Oram Rodmanae dicidnis fécit, he brought the coast under 
(made the coast of) Roman rule; L. 21, 60. Fiés ndbilium fontium, you 
will become (one) of the noble fountains; H. 8, 13, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 SYNTAX 
1, Aequi, boni, and reliqui occur as Predicate Genitives in such expres- 
sions as aequi facere, aequi bonique facere, boni cSnsulere, to take in 
good part, reliqui facere, to leave, and esse reliqui, to be left: 
Aequi bonique facid, I take it in good part; T. Heaut. 788. Milités nihil 
reliqui victis fécére, the soldiers left nothing to the vanquished; 8. C. 11. 
2. For the general use of the Predicate Genitive, see also 439. 
Predicate Genitive of Price and Value 
448. The Predicate Genitive of Price and Value is used with 
sum and with verbs of Valuing; especially with aestimd, facio, 
and putd: 
Parvi pretii est, he is of small value. Magni erunt mihi tuae litterae, your 
letters will be of great value to me. Patrem tuum plirimi féci, 7 prized your 
Sather most highly (made of the greatest value); ©. Att. 16,16,D. Ea magni 
aestimantur, those things are highly valued. Hondrés magni putare, to deem 
honors of great value. Non flocci faciunt, they care not a straw (lock of 
wool); Pl. Prin. 211. Non habed nauci Marsum, I do not regard Marsus of the 
least account ; C. Div. 1,58. Hiius non faciam, I shall not care that (a snap) 
for it; T. Ad. 163. 
1. The Genitive of Price or Value is generally an adjective, as magni, 
parvi, tanti, quanti; pliiris, minGris; mAaximi, plirimi, minimi, but 
pretii is sometimes expressed as in the first example. Nihili and a few 
other Genitives occur, chiefly in familiar discourse. 
2. With aestimé the price and value are denoted either by the Genitive 
or by the Ablative : 
Si prata magnd aestimant; quanti est aestimanda virtis, if they value 
meadows at a high price, at what price ought virtue to be valued ? C. Parad. 
6, 8, 51. 
8. In expressions of price and value, pend6, common in early Latin, is 
exceedingly rare in the classical period : 
Quae parvi pendunt, which they regard of little value; T. Hee. 513. Ea vos 
parvi pendébatis,! those things you deemed of little importance ; 8. C. 52, 9. 
4, Tanti, quanti, pliiris, and minGris are used as Genitives of Price 
even with verbs of Buying and Selling, though with these verbs price is 
generally expressed by the Ablative : 
Canius émit tanti quanti PY¥thius voluit, Canius purchased them (the gar- 
dens) at as high a price as Pythius wished ; ef. ©. of. 8, 14,59. Véndd meum 
non pliris, quam céteri, fortasse mindris, I sell mine (my grain) no higher

  GENITIVE 217 
than the others, perhaps lower. Quanti émptae, purchased at what price ? 
Parvé, at a low price ; H. 8.2, 3,156. Véndidit hic auré patriam, he sold his 
country for gold; Y. 6. 621. 
5. For the Ablative of Price, see 478. 
Predicate Genitive with Réfert and Interest 
449. The Construction of réfert and interest is as follows: 
1. The Person or Thing! interested is denoted by the Genitive, but 
instead of the Genitive of a personal or reflexive pronoun, the Ablative 
feminine of the Possessive is regularly used: 
Neque réfert ciiiusquam, nor does it concern any one; Tac. An. 4,33. Quid 
Mildnis intererat, how was it the interest of Milo ? C. Mil. 13,34. Interest 
omnium, it ts the interest of all. Saliitis comminis interest, i¢ concerns the 
public welfare. Tua et mea interest, itis your interest and mine ; C. Fam. 16,4, 4. 
Norr. —In a few cases the person is denoted by the Dative or by the 
Accusative with ad ; chiefly with réfert, which often omits the person: 
Dic quid réferat intra natiirae finés viventi, tell what difference it makes to 
one living in accord with nature; H.8.1, 1,49. Quid id ad mé réfert, how 
does that concern me ? Pi. Pers. 4, 8, 44. 
2. The Subject of Importance, or that which involves the interest, is 
expressed by an Infinitive, or clause, or by a neuter pronoun: 
Interest omnium récté facere, to do right is the interest of all ; C. Fin. 2, 
92,72. Non réfert quam multés librds habeas, it matters not how many books 
you have; cf. Sen. E.5,4. Quid tua id réfert, how does that concern you ? 
3. The Degree of Interest is expressed by an adverb, an adverbial 
Accusative, or a Genitive of Value: 
Vestra hoc maximé interest, this especially interests you; C. Sul. 25, 79. 
Theodori nihil interest, i¢ does not all interest Theodorus. Illud mea magni 
interest, that greatly interests me; C. Att. 11, 22. 
4. The Object or End for which it is important is expressed by the 
Accusative with ad, rarely by the Dative: 
Magni ad hondrem nostrum interest, for our honor it is of great im- 
portance; C. Fam. 16, 1, 1. 
Nore,—The most plausible explanation hitherto given of this construction 
is that the Genitive with réfert depends upon ré, the Ablative of rés contained 
in the verb, that the Possessive, mea, tua, etc., agrees with the Ablative ré, 
and that interest, a later word, simply follows the analogy of réfert.   
1A thing is rarely so used unless personified.

  218 SYNTAX 
Genitive with Adjectives 
450. Rule.—- Many adjectives take an Objective Genitive 
to complete their meaning : 
Avidi laudis fuistis, you have been very desirous of praise. Cupidus es 
gloriae, you are fond of glory. Pridéns rei militaris erat, he was skilled in 
military science; N.9,1,2. Habétis ducem memorem vestri, oblitum sui, 
you have a leader mindful of you, forgetful of himself; ©. 0. 4,9,19. Pléna 
Graecia poétarum fuit, Greece was full of poets. Gallia hominum fertilis 
fuit, Gaul was fruitful in men. Homo amantissimus patriae, a man very 
fond of his country. Tuventiis belli patiéns, youth capable of enduring the 
hardships of war; 8.0.7. 
1. This Genitive corresponds to the Objective Genitive with nouns. Com- 
pare the following: cupidus gl6riae, desirous of glory; propter gloriae 
cupiditatem, on account of the desire of glory. 
2. For the Genitive with dignus and indignus, see 481, 1. 
451. This. Objective Genitive is used, 
1. With Adjectives denoting Desire, Knowledge, Skill, Recollection, 
and the like, with their contraries: sapientiae studidsus, studious (stu- 
* dent) of wisdom; peritus belli, skilled in war ; cOnscius coniiiratidnis, 
cognizant of the conspiracy; Insuétus navigandi, unacquainted with navi- 
gation: 
Quis est omnium tam ignarus rérum, who is so ignorant of all things ? 
Omnés immemorem beneficii ddérunt, all hate him who is unmindful of a 
Savor ; C. Off. 2, 18, 63. 
Nors. —Certus with the Genitive in the best prose occurs only in the 
phrase certiGrem facere, to inform, which takes either the Genitive or the 
Ablative with dé, though Caesar admits only the latter construction : 
  Certidrem mé sui consilii fécit, he informed me of his plan; ©. Att. 9, 2,8. 
His dé rébus certior factus, having been informed of these things. 
2. With Adjectives denoting Participation, Characteristic, Guilt, Full- 
ness, Mastery, etc., with their contraries: rati6nis particeps, endowed 
with (sharing) reason; ratiénis expers, destitute of reason; manifestus 
rérum capitalium, convicted of capital crimes: 
Erat Italia pléna Graecdrum artium, Italy was full of Grecian arts; 
©, Arch. 3, 5. Viri propria est fortitiidd, fortitude is characteristic of a true 
man. Mei poténs sum, J am master of myself. Omnés virttitis compotés 
beati sunt, a7 (who are) possessed of virtue are happy ; 0. Tusc. 5, 18, 89.
-P-A-G-E-235
  
  GENITIVE 219 
~ Nore 1.—A few adjectives, as similis, dissimilis ; aliénus, comminis ; 
contrarius and superstes admit either the Genitive or the Dative; see 435, 4: 
Canis similis lupd, a dog similar to a wolf; C.N.D.1, 35,97. CYri similis 
esse voluit, he wished to be like Cyrus; 0. Brut. 81, 282. 
Nors 2.— Cénscius may take an Objective Genitive in connection with 
the Dative of a personal or reflexive pronoun : 
Méns sibi c6nscia récti, a mind conscious (to itself) of rectitude. 
3. With Present Participles used as Adjectives: 
Est amans sui virtiis, virtue is fond of itself; C. Am. 26,98. Vir amantissi- 
mus rei piblicae, a man very fond of the republic. Virtiis efficiéns est 
voluptatis, virtue is productive of pleasure ; cf. 0. Off. 3,33. Appetentés gloriae 
fuistis, you have been desirous of glory. 
Nore. — Observe the difference in meaning between a participle with an 
objective Genitive and the same participle with a direct object. .Amans 
patriae, fond of his country, represents the affection as permanent and 
constant ; whereas the participial construction, amans patriam, loving his 
country, designates a particular instance or act. 
452. In poetry and in late prose, especially in Tacitus, the 
Genitive is used: 
1. With Verbals in 4x and with Adjectives of almost every variety of 
meaning, simply to define their application : 
Fugax ambitisnis eram, I was inclined to shun ambition; 0. Tr. 4, 10. 
Tenax propositi, steadfast of purpose ; H.3,3. Aevi matiirus, mature in age; 
V.5,73. Séri studidrum, late in studies; W.8.1,10. Aeger animi,! afflicted in 
spirit; L.1,58. Fidéns animi, conjident in spirit ; V. 2, 61. 
2. With a few Adjectives to denote Separation, or Cause, like the 
Ablative: 
Liber laborum, released from his labors; H. A. P.212. Integer vitae scele- 
risque pirus, of upright life and innocent of crime; H. 1, 22. Nétus animi 
paterni, distinguished for paternal affection ; H. 2, 2. 
453. Adjectives which usually take the Genitive sometimes 
admit other constructions. Compare the following examples: 
1. Genitive, or Accusative with ad or in; 
Avidi laudis fuistis, you have been very desirous of praise; C. Man. 3, 7. 
Avidi ad piignam, eager for battle; L. 7,28. Avidus in novas rés, eager for 
new things ; cf. L. 22, 21. 
  
1 Probably a Locative in origin, as animis, not anim6rum, is used in similar 
instances in the plural.  
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 SYNTAX 
2. Genitive, Dative, or Accusative with ad: 
Hominés insuéti laboris, men wnaccustomed to labor ; Caes. 7, 80. Insuétus 
moribus Roémanis, wnaccustomed to Roman manners; cf. L. 28,18. Insuétus 
ad piignam, unaccustomed to battle ; L. 81, 85. 
8. Genitive, Dative, or Ablative with dé or in: 
Conscius conitirationis, cognizant of the conspiracy ; 8. C.87. Huic facinori 
conscius, aware of this crime ; ©. Cael. 21,52. Tis dé rébus cdnscius, aware of 
these things ; cf. C. Att. 2, 24. 
4. Genitive, Accusative with ad, or Ablative with or without in: 
Pridéns rei militaris, skilled in military science ; N.9,1, Priidéns ad con- 
silia, wise for counsel ; C. Font. 15,33. Priidéns in itre civili, learned in civil 
law ; ©. Am. 2. 
5. The Genitive, or the Ablative : 
Mare refertum praeddnum, a sea full of pirates; C. Rab. P. 8,20. Domus 
referta vasis Corinthiis, a house full of Corinthian vases; C. Rose. A. 46, 133. 
Genitive with Verbs 
454. Rule. — Verbs of Remembering and Forgetting — 
memini, reminiscor, and obliviscor — regularly take the Objec- 
tive Genitive when used of Persons, but either the Genitive 
or the Accusative when used of Things : 
Vivorum memini nec Epiciiri licet oblivisci, I remember the living and 
it is not allowable to forget Epicurus ; ©. ¥in.5,1. Oblitus sum mei, J have 
Sorgotten myself; T. Eun. 306. Animus meminit praeteritorum, the soul 
remembers the past} C.Diy.1,30. Beneficia meminérunt, they remember 
favors ; ©. Plane. 33. Reminisci virtiitis Helvetiorum, to remember the valor 
of the Helvetii ; cf. Caes. 1,13. Eas (rés) reminisci, to remember those things ; 
©. Sen. 21,78. Veteris contuméliae oblivisci, to forget the ancient disgrace ; 
Caes. 1,14. Tdtam causam oblitus est, he forgot the whole.case ; O. Brut. 60, 217.   
  1. Observe that memini, reminiscor, and obliviscor admit a double 
construction. As transitive verbs they may take the Accusative, but by 
virtue of their signification, to be mindful of, to be forgetful of, they may take 
the Genitive; reminiscitur = memor est; obliviscitur = immemor est. 
The close relationship between the Genitive with these verbs and the Genitive 
with adjectives is readily seen in the following examples : 
Memorés virtiitis tuae, mindful of your valor ; ©. Fam. 1, 7,2. Reminisceré- 
tur virtiitis Helvétidrum, that he should remember the valor of the Helvetii ; 
Caes, 1,13,
-P-A-G-E-237
    
GENITIVE 221 
2. The Accusative is regularly used in neuter pronouns and adjectives, 
and it may be used of a person remembered by a contemporary: 
Cinnam memini, I remember Cinna ; ©. Ph. 5, 6. 
8. Memini, I make mention of, may take the Ablative with dé: 
Meministi dé exsulibus, you make mention of the exiles ; 0. Ph. 2, 86. 
4, Venit mihi (tibi, etc.) in mentem = reminiscor, generally takes the 
Genitive, but sometimes the Nominative, though in Cicero only rés, or a 
neuter pronoun or adjective : 
Venit mihi Platonis in mentem, the recollection of Plato comes to my mind ; 
C. Fin. 5,1. Ndn venit in mentem piigna, does not the battle occur to your mind ? 
L.8,5. Ea tibi in mentem veniunt, those things occur to your mind ; ©. Att. 15, 11, 
455. Recordor, I recall, when used of Persons, takes the Abla- 
tive with dé, but when used of Things, it almost always takes 
the Accusative, rarely the Genitive: 
Recordare dé céteris, bethink yourself of the others; ©. Sull. 2,5. Ut tri- 
umphés recordentur, so that they may recall triumphs; 0.Sen.5 13. Flagi- 
tidrum sudrum recordabitur, he will recall his base deeds; C. Pis. 6, 12. 
Accusative and Genitive 
456. Rule. — Verbs of Reminding, Admonishing, and verbs 
of Accusing, Convicting, Condemning, Acquitting, take the 
Accusative of the Person and the Genitive of the Thing, 
Crime, Charge, ete.: 
Ipse té veteris amicitiae commonefécit, he himself reminded you of your 
old friendship; cf. Ad. Her. 4, 24,33. Mearum mé miseriarum commonés, 
you remind me of my misfortunes. Eum tii acciisas avaritiae, do you accuse 
him of avarice? ©. Flac. 88, 83. Acciisitus est proditidnis, he was accused of 
treason. Levitatis plérdsque convineunt, they convict most men of fickleness. 
Ut capitis hominem innocentissimum condemnarent, so that they condemned 
a most innocent man on a capital charge ; C. Or. 1, 54,238. Ttdex absolvit in- 
itriarum eum, the judge acquitted him on a charge of assault. 
1. Instead of the Genitive of the Thing, Crime, etc., the Ablative with 
dé or the Accusative of a neuter pronoun or adjective is often used. 
This is the common construction with moneé and its compounds: 
Dé qué vos admonul, of which I have reminded you; ©. Man. 15,45. Tlud 
mé admonés, you admonish me of that; ©. Att. 9, 9,2 Si id ndn mé accisas, 
¥f you do not accuse me of that; Pl. Trin. 96.  
-P-A-G-E-238
    222 SYNTAX 
2. With verbs of Accusing, etc., the Genitive with némine, crimine, 
iidicid, or some similar word is sometimes used. This may be the 
original construction, and if so, it is a sufficient explanation of the Geni- 
tive with these verbs.1_ Compare the following examples: 
Né quem innocentem itidicid capitis arcessds, that you should not arraign 
an innocent man on a capital charge ; ©. Off. 2, 14,51. Inimicum fratris capitis 
arcessit, he arraigned his brother's enemy on a capital charge; Ad Her. 1, 11, 18. 
Nore. — Latin verbs of Accusing, when they mean simply to find fault 
with, to complain of, take the Accusative of the crime, or fault, as in English : 
‘Inertiam acciisas aduléscentium, you complain of the indolence of the young 
men; C. Or. 58, 246, 
3. With verbs of Condemning, the Penalty is generally expressed by 
the Ablative, with or without dé, or by the Accusative with a preposi- 
tion, usually ad. The Ablative is regularly used when the penalty is a 
fine of a definite sum of money: 
Peciinia multitus est, he was condemned to pay a fine in money; N. 1, 7, 6. 
Si illum morte multassem, if J had condemned him to death. Tertia parte 
agri damnati, condemned to forfeit a third of their land. Multos ad béstias 
condemnavit, he condemned many to the wild beasts ; Suet. Cal. 27. 
4. Notice the following special expressions: dé maiestate or maiestatis 
damniare, to condemn for high treason; dé vi damnare, to condemn for 
assault; dé pectiniis repetundis postulare, to prosecute for extortion ; 
inter sicarids damnare, to convict of homicide; vOti damnatus, con- 
demned to fulfill a vow = haying obtained a wish ; ad metalla condemna- 
tus, condemned to the mines. 
Genitive with Verbs of Feeling 
‘457. Rule. —Misereor and miseréscd take the Objective 
Genitive ; miseret, paenitet, piget, pudet, and taedet take the 
Accusative of the Person and the Genitive? of the Object 
which produces tlie feeling : 
  
1 Observe, however, that the use of the Genitive with these verbs in Latin ac- 
cords entirely with the English idiom ; as, he was accused of treason. 
2 The Genitive with some of these verbs of feeling doubtless follows the an- 
alogy of other constructions, in which the Genitive depends on a noun or adjec- 
tive, expressed or understood, but with others it seems to depend directly on the 
substantive idea suggested by the verbs themselves. Thus taedet readily sug- 
gests its exact equivalent taedium capit. Indeed, Seneca’s taedium eum 
vitae capit, in which vitae depends upon taedium, is equivalent to eum vitae 
taedet.
-P-A-G-E-239
GENITIVE 223 
Miserémini socidrum, have pity on our allies; ©. Ver. 1, 28, 72. Arcadii 
miseréscite régis, pity the Arcadian king; Y. 8, 5%3. Edrum nods miseret, 
we pity them (pity for, or of them moves us); ©. Mil. 34,92. Nostri ndsmet 
paenitet, we are dissatisfied with ourselves, T. Ph. 172. Fratris mé@ piget, 
Lam grieved at my brother. Mé stultitiae meae pudet, J am ashamed of 
my folly. Mé civitatis morum taedet, I am tired of the manners of the state. 
  1. Miserésc6 belongs to poetry. 
2. Miseror and commiseror, J pity, deplore, take the Accusative in the 
best prose: 
Miserantur comminem Galliae fortiinam, they deplore the common fortune 
of Gaul ; Caes, 7, 1, 5. 
3. The impersonal verbs miseret, paenitet, etc., sometimes admit an im- 
‘personal subject, as an Infinitive or clause, rarely a neuter pronoun or nihil: 
  Neque mé vixisse paenitet, nor am I sorry to have lived; ©. Sen. 23, 84. 
Non té haec pudent, do not these things put you to shame ? T. Ad. 754. 
4, Pudet sometimes takes the Genitive of the person in whose presence 
one has a feeling of shame or unworthiness:    
Mé tui vudet, Tam ashamed in your presence ; T. Ad. 683. 
5, Like miseret are sometimes used miseréscit, commiseréscit, and 
miserétur; like taedet, pertaesum est and, in early Latin, distaedet 
and a few other rare words. In Suetonius pertaesus occurs with the 
Accusative. : 
Genitive with Special Verbs 
458. In certain Special Constructions, largely colloquial, or 
poetical in their origin,' many verbs by analogy occasionally ad- 
mit the Genitive, or if transitive, the Accusative and Genitive: 
1. Some verbs denoting Desire, Emotion, or Feeling, like adjectives 
and verbs of the same general meaning and construction : 
Cupiunt tui, they desire you; Pl. Mil. 963. Né tui quidem testimdnii veri- 
tus, regarding not even your testimony; ©. Att. 8,4. Ego animi? pended, 
Lam uncertain in mind ; cf. C. Leg. 1,8. Discrucior animi,? I am troubled in 
spirit. Désipiébam mentis, Z was out of my senses. 
2. Some Verbs of Plenty and Want, as compled, impled, eged, 
indige6, like adjectives of the same general meaning (451, 2): 
  
  1 Greek influence may also be recognized in some of them. 
2 Animi in such instances is probably a Locative in origin, as animis, not 
anim6rum, is used in the same way in the plural.

Virtiis exercitatiénis indiget, virtwe requires exercise; of. C. Fin. 8, 15. 
Eged consilii, J need counsel ; ©. Att. 7,22. Mé complévit formidinis, he has 
Jilled me with fear ; Pl. Men, 901. 
8. Some verbs denoting Mastery or Participation, — potior, adipi- 
scor, régné,— like adjectives of similar meaning (451, 2): 
Partis Siciliae potitus est, he became master of a part of Sicily; N. 10, 5. 
Régnavit populdrum, he was king of the peoples ; HU. 8, 80. 
4. In the poets, a few verbs which usually take the Ablative of 
Separation or Cause admit the Genitive: 
Mé laborum levas, you relieve me of my labors; Pl. Rud. 247. Abstinétd 
jrarum, abstain from quarrels; H. 3, 2%, 69. Désine querellirum, desist 
From: your lamentations. Mirari belli labérum, to wonder at warlike 
achievements. Damni infecti prdmittere, to become responsible for pos- 
sible damage; cf. C. Top. 4, 22. 
Nore. — The Genitive in Exclamations, in imitation of the Greek, occurs 
in three or four isolated examples in the Latin poets, but it is not found in 
Terence, Vergil, or Horace : 
O mihi niintii beati, O the glad tidings to me; Catul. 9, 5. 
ABLATIVE 
459. The Latin Ablative performs the duties of three cases 
originally distinct: r 
I. Ablative Proper, denoting the relation From: 
Il. Instrumental, denoting the relation With, By: 
II. Locative, denoting the relation In, At. 
Nore. — This threefold nature of the Latin Ablative gives us a basis for 
a general classification, at once scientific and practical, although in the course 
of the development of the language so many new applications of these origi- 
nal elements were made that it is sometimes impossible to determine with 
certainty to which of them a given construction owes its origin. 
I. Ablative Proper 
460. — The Ablative Proper includes: 
1. Ablative of Separation; see 461. 
2. Ablative of Source, including Agency, Parentage, etc.; see 467. 
3. Ablative of Comparison; see 471.

town itself, is meant:

through whose agency or help, the action is effected :

of the Fabricii ; cf. C. Clu. 28, 62.

-P-A-G-E-245
  
  ABLATIVE 229 
ABLATIVE WITH COMPARATIVES 
471. Rule. —Comparatives without quam are followed by 
the Ablative: 
Nihil est virtiite! amabilius, nothing is more lovely than virtue. C. Am. 8. 
Nihil habet iticundius vita, he considers nothing more agreeable than life. 
Amicitia, qua nihil melius habémus, friendship, than which we have nothing 
better. Nihil lacrima citius iréscit, nothing dries sooner than a tear. 
1. Comparatives with quam are followed by the Nominative or by the 
case of the corresponding noun before them : =e 
Melior est certa pax quam spérata victoria, better is a sure peace than a 
hoped-for victory ; L. 30,30. Néminem aequidrem reperiet quam mé, he will 
Jind no one more just than (he will find) me. Equum melidrem habet quam 
tuus est, he has a better horse than yours is; ©. Inv. 1, 31, 52. 
2. After quam the second of the two nouns compared is_sometimes pens — ee 
omitted : 
Themistocli nomen quam Soldnis est illistrius, the name of Themistocles 
is more illustrious than that of Solon ; cf. C. Off. 1, 22, 75. 
8. The Ablative is used chiefly in negative sentences. It is freely used 
for quam with a Nominative or Accusative, regularly so for quam with the 
Nominative or Accusative of a relative pronoun, as in the third example 
under the rule. In other cases quam is retained in the best prose, though 
sometimes omitted in poetry. 
4, After pliis, minus, amplius, or longius, in expressions of number 
and quantity, quam is often omitted without influence upon the construc- 
tion ; sometimes also after maior, minor, etc. : 
  Técum plis annum vixit, he lived with you more than a year ; C. Quine. 12, 41. 
Minus duo milia effiigérunt, Jess than two thousand escaped; L. 24,16. Non 
amplius novem annos natus, not more than nine years old; cf. N. 28, 2, 8. 
5. Instead of an Ablative after a comparative, a preposition with its case 
—as ante, prae, praeter, or supra —is sometimes used, especially in poetry : 
Ante alids immanior, more monstrous than (before) the others ; V.1, 347. 
6. In poetry and in conversational prose, alius, involving a comparison, 
other than, is sometimes used with the Ablative, but in the best prose its 
regular construction is alius ac or atque, alius quam, or alius nisi: 
  
1This Ablative furnishes the standard of comparison—that from which one 
starts. Thus, if virtue is taken as the standard of what is lovely, nothing is 
more so. Virttite = quam virtis; vit& = quam vitam (habet), 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
230 SYNTAX 
Putare alium sapiente bondque beadtum, to consider any other than the 
wise and good happy; cf. H. E. 1, 16, 20. Nihil aliud nisi pax quaesita est,

parison with the victory ; L. 10, 14, 21.

ef. Caes. 2,3. Id spé omnium sérius fuit, this was later than all hoped it 
would be; L. 2, 3. 
9. In rare instances, mostly poetical, a few verbs and adverbs involving 
comparison —as mal6, praest6, aequé, adaequé — admit the Ablative : 
Niallés his mallem lidds spectisse, no games would I prefer to have seen 
rather than these; H.S.2,8,79. Mé aequé fortiinatus, equally fortunate with 
me; Pl. Cure. 141. 
10. With comparatives the Measure of Difference —the amount by which 
one thing surpasses another — is denoted by the Ablative (479): 
Hibernia dimidid minor quam Britannia, Ireland smaller by one-half than 
Britain. 
II. Instrumental Ablative 
472. The Instrumental Ablative includes 
1. Ablative of Association; see 478.

ABLATIVE oF AssocIATION 
473. Rule. — The Ablative of Association is used 
1. To denote Accompaniment, or Association in a strict 
sense. It then takes the preposition cum:

Gruptionem fécérunt, with these arms they made a sally; Caes. 2, 88.
-P-A-G-E-247

fied by an adjective or by a Genitive:    Flimen ripis.praeruptis, a stream with precipitous banks; Cues. 6, 7. 
Summa virtiite aduléscéns, a youth of the highest worth. Cato singulari 
fuit industria, Cato was a man of remarkable industry ; N. 2%, 8. 
Nore 1.—The Ablative of Characteristic and the Genitive of Character- 
istic supplement each other. The Genitive is generally used to designate per- 
manent characteristics, as Kind, Size, Weight, Value, and the like. In other 
cases the Ablative is generally used. 
Nore 2,—The Ablative of Characteristic may be either Attributive, as in 
the first two examples, or Predicative, as in the last example. 
  8. To denote Manner or Attendant Circumstance.) It 
then takes the preposition cum, or is modified by an adjec- 
tive or by a Genitive: 
Cum silentid auditi sunt, they were heard in silence. Templum magna 
ciira ciistodiunt, they guard the temple with great care. Epulabatur more 
Persarum, he feasted in the style of the Persians. Catd summa cum gloria 
vixit, Cato lived with the highest glory; ©. Ver. 5, 70, 180. 
  Nore.—The Ablative of Manner often takes cum, even when modified by 
an adjective, as in the last example. 
474, The Ablative of Association is used without cum in a 
few special instances, as follows: 
1. A few Ablatives, perhaps involving the idea of Means: arte, according 
to art, skillfully; clam6re, with a shout; cSnsilid, on purpose; Srdine, 
in an orderly way 
NémG solitus via dicere, no one accustomed to speak properly; cf. C. Brut. 
12,46. Aut vi aut fraude fit, it is done either by violence or by fraud; ef. 0. 
Off. 1, 13, 41. 
Nore. — The Accusative with per sometimes denotes Manner: per vim, 
violently ; per fraudem, fraudulently ; per lidum, sportively. 
2. The Ablative of Association is sometimes used without cum, after verbs 
meaning to mingle or to join together, as cOnfund6, iungd, misced, and 
_ their compounds ; also whenever the idea of means is involved, especially in 
military operations: 
  
1-Note the close connection between these three uses of the Ablative —the first 
designating an attendant person or thing, the second an attendant quality, the 
third an attendant circumstance.  
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 : SYNTAX 
Siculis cénfunditur undis, it mingles with the Sicilian waters; V. 8, 696. 
Improbitas scelere itincta, depravity joined with crime ; O. Or. 2, 58, 237. Gravi 
tate mixtus lepds, pleasantry united with dignity; 0. R.P.2,1. Ingenti exer- 
citi profectus, having set out with a large army; L. 7, 9% 
Nor 1.—In military language the Ablative of Association generally takes 
cum, if without modifiers or modified only by a numeral, otherwise it is gen- 
erally used without cum: cum exercitii, but ingenti exerciti. 
Nore 2.— Instead of the Ablative of Association, the Dative is sometimes 
used with verbs denoting Union or Contention: 
Sapientia ifincta Gloquentiae, wisdom united to eloquence ; cf. C. Or. 8, 85, 142. 
Solus tibi certat, he alone competes with you; V.B.5,8. 
3. A special use of the Ablative of Association is seen with faciG, f16, and 
sum in such expressions as the following : 
Quid hic homine faciis, what will you do with this man? ©. Ver. 2, 16. 
Quid té futiirum est, what will become of you ? C. Ver. 2, 64, 155. 
Nore. —The Ablative with dé occurs in nearly the same sense : 
Sed dé fratre quid fiet, but what will become of my brother ? T. Ad. 996. 
ABLATIVE OF CAUSE 
475. Rule. — The Ablative of Cause, designating the 
Cause, Ground, or Reason for an action, is used without 
a preposition : 1 
Gubernatoris ars iitilitate landatur, the pilot’s art is praised because of 
its usefulness; ©. Fin. 1,13. Quisque gloria diicitur, every one is influenced 
by glory. Liixuria civitas labdrabat, the state was suffering from luxury. 
Nimio gaudié désipitbam, I was wild with (from) excessive joy. Régni

was ill in consequence of his wounds ; N.1, 7, 5. 
1. When the cause is fear, anger, hatred, etc., it is often combined with a 
Perfect Participle, as in the fifth and sixth examples. 
2. Causa and gratia, as Ablatives of Cause, are regularly limited by the 
~ Genitive or by a possessive or interrogative pronoun : 
1The Ablative of Cause seems to have been developed in part from the Instru- 
mental case and in part from the true Ablative.  
-P-A-G-E-249
ABLATIVE 233 
Quem hondris gratia ndmind, whom I name as a mark of honor; 0. Rose. A. 
2,6. Vestra hoc causa volébam, I desired this on your account ; ©. Or. 1, 85, 164,

8. Examine the following specimens of the Ablative of Cause, more com- 
monly limited by an adjective or Genitive, c6nsuétiidine, itire, lége, sen- 
tentia, and Ablatives in &% from verbal nouns: cénsuétiidine sud, in 
accordance with his own custom; mea sententia, according to or in my 
opinion ; alié6rum hortati, at the request of others; hortati sud, at his 
own request ; populi iussii, at the bidding of the people. 
4. Instead of the Ablative of Cause, the Ablative with 4, ab, dé, 6, ex, 
is sometimes used to emphasize the idea of Source, from which Cause was so 
readily developed, as ex cOnsuétiidine sua, in accordance with their custom ; 
ex sententia tua, in accordance with your wish: 
Mare 4 sole colliicet, the sea gleams with the light of the sun (from the 
sun). Ex vulneribus periére, they perished of their wounds. 
5. The Ablative with prae in classical Latin generally denotes a Hin- 
drance or an Obstacle :

ABLATIVE oF MEANS 
476. Rule.-— The Instrument and Means of an action are 
“enoted by the Ablative without a preposition: 
Ipse sui manii fécit, he did it himself with his own hand. Cornibus tauri

    234 SYNTAX

ABLATIVE oF Means —Sprciat Uses

fruor, fungor, potior, vescor, and their compounds: 
Plirimis rébus fruimur atque itimur, we enjoy and use very many

duty of a senator. Magna erat praeda potitus, he had obtained great booty. 
Lacte et carne vescébantur, they lived (fed) on milk and flesh ; N. 89,7. 
1. These deponent verbs are all survivals of the middle voice, and accord- 
ingly contain the direct object in themselves, while the Ablative is the means 
by which the action is effected; thus itor, J use, I serve myself by means of ; 
fruor, I enjoy, I delight myself with, etc. Originally transitive, they are occa- 
sionally so used in classical authors: 
Utéris operam meam, you shall have (use) my assistance ; Pl. Poen. 1088. 
2. Ttor admits two Ablatives of the same person or thing: 
Facili mé titétur patre, he will find me an indulgent father ; T. Heaut. 217. 
3. Potior admits the Genitive: 
Partis Siciliae potitus est, he became master of a part of Sicily; N. 10,5. 
II. The Ablative of Means is used with verbs of Abound- 
ing and Filling and with adjectives of Fullness: abundé, 
redundé, adflud, etc.; compled, expled, impled, oneré, etc.;

Mé complévit formidinis, he filled me with fear; Pl. Men. 901. Ttaliam ve- 
stris colénis complére voluistis, you wished to jill Italy with your colonists. 
2. Most adjectives of Fullness occasionally admit the Genitive. With plé- 
nus this is the regular construction in the best prose. In Cicero refertus takes 
the Genitive when used of persons, but the Ablative when used of things: 
Erat Italia pléna Graecarum artium, Italy was full of Grecian arts; C. Arch.

permagni, tanti, tanti-dem, quanti, pliris, plirimi, minGris, minimi, 
ete. 
8. Instead of the Ablative of Price, adverbs are sometimes used, as bene 
emere, to buy well (i.e. at a low price); bene véndere, to sell well (i.e. at 
a high price). Z 
4. Exchanging. — With verbs of Exchanging —miit6, commiité, etc. —

Cir valle permiitem Sabina divitiais, why should I exchange the Sabine vale

glory ; cf. ©. Sest. 16, 87. 
6. For a fuller treatment of the Genitive of Price, see 448.

480. Rule. — A Noun, Adjective, or Verb may take an 
Ablative to define its application :

not in power; N.21,1. Fuit claudus alterd pede, he was lame in one foot. 
Hi lingua, instititis, légibus inter sé differunt, those differ from each other

Minimus nati omnium, the youngest of all. Difficile dicti est, it is difi- 
cult to tell (in the telling). 
2. The Ablative of Specification is often used with verbs of Measuring 
and Judging, to show in reference to what the statement is true: 
Magnés hominés virtite métimur, non fortiind, we measure great men by 
(in reference to) their merit, not their success ; N.18,1. Benevolentiam non 
ardore amoris, sed cnstantia itidicémus, let us judge of good will, not by 
the glow of affection, but by its constancy. 
3. The Ablative of Specification, in a strict sense, shows in what respect 
or particular anything is true, and, in a somewhat freer sense, in regard to 
what, in reference to what, it is true. 
4. For the Accusative of Specification, see 416, 
481. To the Ablative of Specification may be referred the Ablative with 
dignus and indignus : 
Digni sunt amicitia, they are worthy of friendship ; C. Am. 21,79. Té hondre 
indignissimum iidicat, he judges you most unworthy of honor; ©. Vat. 16, 89, 
     
-P-A-G-E-254
  238 ' SYNTAX 
1. In rare instances, mostly poetical, dignus and indignus occur with

Dignissimum tuae virtiitis, most worthy of your high character ; cf. O. Att. 
8,15, A. Magndrum haud/umquam indignus avérum, never unworthy of my 
great sires ; V. 12, 649. 
2. Dignor, as a passive verb meaning to be deemed worthy, takes the Abla- 
tive; but as a deponent verb meaning to deem worthy, used only in poetry 
and late prose, it takes the Accusative and Ablative : 
Hondre dignantur, they are deemed worthy of honor ; ©. Inv. 2, 58,161. Haud 
tali mé dignor hondre, not of such honor do I deem myself worthy ; V. 1, 885. 
III. Locative and Locative Ablative 
482. The Locative and the Locative Ablative in a measure 
supplement each other. They include 
1. Ablative of Place, generally with the preposition in; see 483. 
2. Locative in Names of Towns; see 483. 
3. Ablative of Time; see 486. 
4. Ablative Absolute; see 489. 
ABLATIVE OF PLACE 
483. Rule. — The Place In Which anything is done is 
denoted generally by the Locative Ablative with the prepo- 
sition in, but in names of Towns by the Locative: 
Caesar duas legidnés in Gallia conscripsit, Caesar enrolled two legions 
in Gaul. In oppido obsidébantur, they were besieged in the town. Exerci- 
tum in hibernis collocavit, he placed the army in winter quarters. 
Romae supplicatio redditur, at Rome a thanksgiving is appointed ; Caes.

rinthi puerds docébat, Dionysius taught boys at Corinth. Carthagine régés 
creaibantur, at Carthage kings were elected; N. 23,7. Aristidés Athénis 
fuit, Aristides was at Athens. 
    1. In the names of Towns, instead of the Locative, the Ablative is used, 
with or without a preposition, when qualified by an adjective or adjective 
pronoun, and sometimes when not thus modified : 
In Illyricd, in ipsi Alexandréa, in Illyria, in Alexandria itself; ©. Att 
11, 16. Longa dominari Alba, to hold sway at Alba Longa; V. 6, 766. In 
monte Alband Lavinidque,! on the Alban mount and at Lavinium ; 
     
    1 Here L&vinio is probably assimilated to the case of monte Alban6, 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  ABLATIVE 239 
2. When oppid6 or urbe accompanies the name of the town in ex- 
pressions of Place, if without a modifier, it takes the preposition in and 
is followed by the Ablative of the name; but if with a modifier, it follows 
the name, and is used either with or without the preposition : 
In oppidd Citid est mortuus, he died in the town Citium; N.5,3. Albae 
constitérunt, in urbe opportina, they halted at Alba, a convenient city ; 
©. Ph. 4, 2, 6. Corinthi, Achadiae urbe, at Corinth, a city of Achaia; Tac. 
2, 
484. Like Names of Towns are used 
1. Many Names of Islands and Peninsulas: 
Condn Cypri vixit, Conon lived in Cyprus; N. 12,3. Miltiadés domum 
Chersonési habuit, Miltiades had a house in the Chersonesus. 
2. The Locatives domi, riri, humi, militiae, belli, and a few others 
found in poets and late writers : 
Et domi et militiae cOnsilium praestabant, they showed their wisdom at 
home and abroad; C. Or. 8, 33, 134. Rivi agere vitam constituit, he decided 
to spend his life in the country. Romae et domi tuae vivere, to live at 
Rome and in your house. Déprehénsus domi Caesaris, caught in the house 
of Caesar; ef. C. Att. 1,12. Tamquam aliénae domi, as if in the house of 
another. Truncum reliquit harénae, he left the body in the sand; V. 12, 382. 
Nore 1.—Domi may be modified by a possessive, a Genitive, or aliénus, 
as in the examples ; when any other modifier is required, the Ablative with 
in is generally used : 
In privata domo firtum, a theft in a private house ; C. ©. 8, 7, 17. 
Nore 2.— Instead of domi with its modifier, apud with an Accusative of 
the person may be used: apud mé = domi meae, at my house: 
Apud té fuit, he was at your house. Fuisti apud Laecam, you were at the 
house of Laeca; C. 0.1, 4. 
485. The Locative Ablative is often used without a preposition : 
1. When the idea of place is figurative rather than literal : 
Med iiidicid stare mals, I prefer to abide by my own judgment ; C. Att. 12, 21. 
Prémissis manére (poetical), to abide by promises; V.2,160. Nova pectore 
versat cOnsilia, she devises (turns over) new plans in her breast. Pendémus 
animis, we are perplexed in mind ; GC. Tuse. 1, 40, 96. 
2. The Locative Ablative qualified by tétus, and the Ablatives terra and 
mari, especially in terra marique, are regularly used without the prepo- 
sition ; locd and locis are generally so used ; occasionally other Ablatives, 
especially when qualified by adjectives: 
   
-P-A-G-E-256
240 SYNTAX 
  MaAnat téta urbe riimor, the report spreads through the whole city ; L. 2, 49, 1. 
Natidnibus terra marique imperare, to rule nations on land and sea; C. Man. 
19,56. Eddem locé nati sunt, they were born in the same situation ; O. Rose. A. 
51,149. Reliquis oppidi partibus, in the remaining parts of the town. 
3. In poetry and late prose, the Locative Ablative is freely used without 
the preposition: 
Licis habitamus opacis, we dwell in shady groves; V. 6,673. Populus 
laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum, the people made the joyful applause thrice 
resound in the theater ; H. 2, 17, 2. 
4, By a difference of idiom, the Latin sometimes uses the Ablative with a, 
ab, 6, or ex, where the English would lead us to expect the Locative Abla- 
tive, but in such cases the Latin calls attention to the place from which the 
action proceeds: 4 or ab dextra, on the right (from the right): 
Has ab utrdque latere protegébat, these he protected on both sides; 
Caes. 6. 1,25. Continentur ina ex parte Rhénd, altera ex parte, monte 
Tira, they are shut in by the Rhine on one side, by mount Jura on 
another; Caes. 1, 2. Ex equis pignare visi sunt, they were seen to fight 
on horseback ; 0. N. D. 2, 2, 6. 
5. Instead of the Locative Ablative, especially in plural names of tribes 
and peoples, the Accusative with apud or inter may be used: 
Civitas magna inter Belgas auctoritate, a state of great influence among 
the Belgae ; Caes. 2, 15. 
Nors. — The Accusative with apud, meaning in the works of, is the reg- 
ular form in citing authors: 
Ille apud Terentium, that well-known character in the works of Terence ; 
©. Fin. 5, 10, 28, 
ABLATIVE oF TIME 
486. Rule. —The Time At or In Which an action takes 
place is denoted by the Ablative without a preposition : 
Solis occisii suas cdpias Ariovistus rediixit, at sunset Ariovistus led back 
his forces; Caes. 1,50. Posterd dié liice prima movet castra, on the following 
day at dawn he moves his camp. Bellum ineunte vére suscépit, he entered 
upon the war in the beginning of spring. 
1. The Ablative of Time is found in the names of Games, Festivals, 
Offices, and in almost any words that may be used to denote time: 
Liberilibus litterfis acc@pi tus, I received your letter on the festival of 
Liber; ©. Fam. 12, 25,1. Consulati dévénimus in medium certamen, in my 
consulship I became involved in the midst of the strife; 0. Or. 1,1.
-P-A-G-E-257
    ABLATIVE 241 
487. The Time Within Which an action takes place is denoted 
by the Ablative with or without in, sometimes with 46: 
‘Ter in annd audire nintium, to hear the tidings three times in the course 
of the year; C. Rose. A. 46, 132. In diébus proximis decem, within the next ten 
days. Némd his annis viginti rei piblicae fuit hostis, there has been no enemy 
of the republic within these twenty years. Dé tertid vigilid castra movet, in 
the third watch he moves his camp ; cf. Caes. 0. 1, 63. 
1. The Ablative with in is often used to call attention to the Circum- 
stances of the Time or the Condition of Affairs: 
In periculdsissim6 rei piiblicae tempore, in a most perilous condition of the 
republic. In tali tempore, at such a time (i.e. under such circumstances). 
2. The Accusative with inter or intra, like the Ablative with in, may be 
used of the Time Within Which; the Accusative with ad or in, of an Ap- 
pointed Time, and with ad or sub, of an Approaching Time; 
Haec inter cénam dictivi, I dictated this during the dinner. Filium intra 
paueds diés amisit, within a few days he lost his son. Omnia ad diem facta 
sunt, all things were done on the appointed day; Caes.2,5. Ad cénam homi- 
nem invitadvit in posterum diem, he invited the man to dinner for the next 
day. Sub vesperum exire, to go out towards evening. 
488. The Interval between two events may be variously ex- 
pressed : 
1. By the Accusative or Ablative with ante or post: 
Classis post diés paucds vénit, after a few days the fleet arrived, Pancds 
ante diés, @ few days before. Homérus annis multis fuit ante Romulum, 
Homer lived many years before Romulus ; C. Brut. 10,40. Paucis ante dibus 
noluit, he declined a few days before. Paucis post annis, a few years after. 
2. By the Accusative or Ablative with ante quam, post quam, or post, 
generally with an ordinal numeral: 
Post diem tertium quam dixerat, the third day after he had spoken; ©. Mil.

was born. Né6nd annd post quam in Hispaniam vénerat, in the ninth year 
after he had come into Spain; N. 22, 4, 2. 
8. By the Ablative of a relative and its antecedent: 
Mors Réscii quadridud qué is occisus est niintiatur, the death of Roscius 
ts announced four days after he was killed ; C. Rose. A. 86, 104. 
Nore 1.—Pridié quam means on the day before, and postridié quam, 
on the day after or a day later: 
Postridié vénit, quam exspectaram, he came @ day later than Ihad expected; 
C. Fam. 16, 14. 
HARK, LAT, GRAM.—17
-P-A-G-E-258
242 SYNTAX 
Nore 2.— The question how long ago? may be answered by the Accusa- 
tive with abhinc : 
Abhine ann6s trecentés fuit, he lived three hundred years ago ; ©. Div. 2, 57, 118, 
Nore 8.—In rare instances the Ablative with abhinc is used like the Abla- 
tive with ante: 
Abhine diébus triginta, thirty days before ; 0. Ver. 2, 52, 185. 
ABLATIVE ABSOLUTE? 
489. Rule.—A noun with a participle, an adjective, or 
another noun, may be put in the Ablative to add to the 
predicate an Attendant Circumstance : 
Servio régnante viguérunt, they flourished in the reign of Servius (Ser- 
vius reigning).? Consulés, régibus exactis, creati sunt, afler the banish- 
ment of the kings,® consuls were elected; L. 4, 4,2. Caesar equitati praemisso 
subsequébatur, Caesar having sent forward his cavalry followed. Hoe dicit, 
mé audiente, he says this in my-hearing. Légatds discédere, nisi miini- 
tis castris, vetuerat, he had forbidden his lieutenants to depart, unless 
the camp was fortified ; Caes. 2,20. Caeld serénd obscirata liix est, while 
the sky was clear, the sun (the light) was obscured ; L.37,4,4. L. Pisdne, 
Auld Gabinio consulibus, in the consulship of L. Piso and Aulus Gabinius. 
1. The Ablative Absolute, much more common than the English Nomina- 
tive Absolute, generally expresses the Time, Cause, or some Attendant Cir- 
cumstance of the action. It is generally best rendered by a noun with a 
preposition —in, during, after, by, with, through, etc.; by an active par- 
ticiple with its object ; or by a clause with when, while, because, if, though, 
ete. ; see examples above. 
2. A conjunction, as nisi, tamquam, etc., sometimes accompanies the 
Ablative, as in the fifth example. 
8. The Ablative in this construction generally refers to some person or 
thing not otherwise mentioned in the clause to which it belongs, but excep- 
tions occur: 
Obsidibus imperatis, hds Aeduis tradit, having demanded hostages, he de- 
livers them to the Aedui ; Caes. 6, 4. 
  
1 This Ablative is called Absolute, because it is not directly dependent for its 
construction upon any other word in the sentence. In classical Latin it ex- 
presses both Instrumental and Locative relations. 
2 Or, while Servius was reigning, or, while Servius was king. ® 
3 Or, after the kings were banished. 
4 The construction by which a noun and an adjective, or two nouns, may be in 
the Ablative Absolute is peculiar to the Latin. In the corresponding construction 
in Sanskrit, Greek, and English, the present participle of the verb, to be, is used.
-P-A-G-E-259
  ABLATIVE 243 
4, In the Ablative Absolute, Perfect Participles of deponent verbs are 
generally found only in the poets and late writers. With an object they are 
first found in Sallust: 
Sulla omnia pollicits, as Sulla promised everything; 8. 103, 7. 
5. Two participles, or a participle and a predicate noun or adjective, are 
occasionally combined with a noun in the Ablative Absolute: 
Agro capt ex hostibus divisd, when the land taken from the enemy had 
been divided; L. 1,46. Hasdrubale imperatére suffect6, when Hasdrubal suc- 
ceeded as commander ; N. 23,8. 
6. An Infinitive or Clause may be in the Ablative Absolute with a neuter 
participle or adjective : 
Alexander, audits Daréum mivisse, pergit, Alexander having heard that 
Darius had withdrawn, advances ; Curt. 5, 13. Multi, incertd quid vitarent, 
interiérunt, many, uncertain what they should avoid, perished; L. 28, 36. 
7. A Participle or an Adjective may stand alone in the Ablative Absolute : 
Multum certat6,! pervicit, he conquered after a hard struggle; Tac. An. 11, 10. 
8. Quisque or ipse in the Nominative may accompany the Ablative 
Absolute : 
Causa ipse pro sé dicta damnatur,? having himself advocated his own 
cause, he is condemned ; L. 4, 44,10. Exercitus, multis sibi quisque imperium 
petentibus, dilabitur,? while many seck the command, each for himself, the 
army goes to pieces ; 8. 18, 3. 
9. Absente nobis, in my absence, in which ndbis is used for mé, is an 
instance of Synesis : 
Quid absente ndbis turbitumst (= turbitum est), what is the disturbance 
in my absence? T. Eun, 649. 
ABLATIVE WITH PREPOSITIONS 
490. Rule. — The Ablative may take a preposition to aid 
in expressing the exact relation intended: 
Matiirat ab urbe proficisci, he hastens to set out from the city. Ab his 
amatur, by these he is loved. Statua ex aere facta, a statue made of bronze. 
  
1 Here the participle is used impersonally, it having been much contested. 
21n the first example ipse may be explained as belonging to the subject of 
damnatur, but in the second quisque has no grammatical connectiom with any 
other word in the sentence. A plausible view of the construction is that, sibi 
quisque, which in certain connections has become almost a stereotyped formula, 
has been brought over unchanged into the Ablative Absolute from the clause 
which it represents. 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
  244 SYNTAX 
Coram frequentissimd conventii, in the presence of the crowded assembly. 
Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, i is sweet and seemly to die for 
one’s country. Tauro tenus régniire iussus est, he was bidden to limit his 
realm by Mount Taurus (to reign as far as Taurus) ; ef. ©. Deiot. 13, 36.    
1. Note the force of the prepositions in the following expressions: ab 
urbe, from the city; ex urbe, out of the city; in urbe, in the city; cum 
urbe, with the city; pr6é urbe, before the city or in behalf of the city. 
2. The following ten prepositions are used with the Ablative only: 
a, ab, abs, from, by 6, ex, out of, from 
absque, without prae, before, in comparison with 
coram, in the presence of pro, before, for 
cum, with sine, without 
dé, down from, from tenus, as far as 
Nore 1.—A and 6 are used only before consonants, aband ex before 
either vowels or consonants. Abs is antiquated, except before té. 
Nore 2.—Cum, when used with a Personal or a Relative Pronoun, is 
generally appended to it. 
Nore 3.—Tenus follows its case. Being in origin the Accusative of a 
noun, it often takes the Genitive ; see 446, 5. 
3. The following four prepositions are used either with the Accusative or 
with the Ablative: 
in, into, in subter, beneath, under, towards 
sub, under, towards super, above, about, beyond 
In and sub with the Accusative after verbs of motion; with the Ablative 
after verbs of rest. Subter and super generally with the Accusative ; sub- 
ter with the Ablative rare and mostly poetical; super with the Ablative 
meaning concerning, of, on, used of a subject of discourse : 
Hannibal exercitum in Italiam dixit, Hannibal led an army into Italy. 
Quam dit in Italia fuit, as long as he was in Italy. Milités sub montem suc- 
cédunt, the soldiers approach towards the mountain. Sub pellibus hiemare, 
to winter in camp (under skins). Subter miirum hostium Avehitur, he is 
borne under the wall of the enemy. Subter dénsa testidine, wnder a compact 
testudo. Aquila super carpentum volitans, an eagle flying above the carriage. 
Hac super ré scribam, I shall write on this subject. 
4, A few words, generally adverbs, sometimes become prepositions, and 
are used with the Ablative, as intus, palam, procul, simul (poetic), and 
rarely clam: 
Tali intus templd, within such a temple; V.7,192. Palam populd, in the 
presence of the people; L. 6,14. Procul dubid, without doubt or far from 
doubtful; L. 39, 40. Simul his, with these; H. 8. 1, 10, 86. Clam vobis, withe 
out your knowledge ; Caes. 0. 2, 82.

  246 SYNTAX 
USE OF ADJECTIVES 
492. Adjectives in Latin correspond in their general use to 
adjectives in English. 
1. In Latin, as in English, an adjective may qualify the complex idea 
formed by a noun with one or more other modifiers: duae legidnés novae,! 
two new legions; navés longae veterés, old war vessels ; columna aurea 
solida, a column of solid gold; oneraria navis maxima, a very large ship 
of burden. 
Norge. — In general no connective is used when adjectives are combined 
as in these examples; but if the first adjective is multi, the connective is 
usually inserted, though it is sometimes omitted, especially when one of the 
adjectives follows the noun: multae bonaeque? artés, many good arts; 
multa et praeclara? facinora, many illustrious deeds; multae liberae 
civitatés, many free states, many republics; multa bella gravia, many 
severe wars. 
493. Prolepsis, or Anticipation. — An adjective or a participle is 
sometimes applied to a noun, especially in poetry, to denote the 
result of the action expressed by the verb: 
Submersis® obrue puppés, overwhelm and sink the ships (overwhelm 
the sunken ships); V. 1, 69. Sciita latentia condunt, they conceal their 
(hidden) shields; V. 8, 237. 
494. Adjectives and Participles are often used Substantively 
in the plural. Thus: 
1. Masculine Adjectives and Participles are used of persons; Neuter 
Adjectives, chiefly in the Nominative and Accusative, are used of things: 
fortés, divités, pauperés, the brave, the rich, the poor; multi, pauci, 
omnés, many, few, all; nostri, vestri, sui, our friends, your friends, their 
Jriends ; spectantés, audientés, discentés, spectators, hearers, learners ; 
bona, iitilia, futiira, good things, useful things, future events ; mea, nostra, 
omnia, my things, our things, all things. 
495. Adjectives and Participles are occasionally used Substan- 
tively in the singular. Thus: 
1 Here duae modifies not simply legiGnés, but legi6nés novae; so veterés 
qualifies navés longae, war vessels. 
2 Lit. many and good; many and illustrious. 
8 Observe that submersas gives the result of the action denoted by cbrue, 
and is not applicable to puppés until that action is performed; latentia likewise 
gives the result of condunt.
-P-A-G-E-263
  
USE OF ADJECTIVES 247 
1. In the masculine in a collective sense, especially as a predicate Geni- 
tive after est, etc., and when accompanied by a pronoun: R6manus = 
Romani, the Roman, the Romans; bonus, the good man, the good; sapi- 
entis est, it is the mark of a wise man or of wise men = it is wise; hic 
doctus, doctus quidam, this learned man, a certain learned man; hic 
Romanus, R6manus quidam, this Roman, a certain Roman. 
2. In the neuter in the Nominative and Accusative, in the Partitive Geni- 
tive, and in the Accusative or Ablative with a preposition: bonum, a good 
thing, @ blessing; malum, an evil thing, an evil; nihil boni, nothing (of 
the) good; nihil himani, nothing human; in futirum, for the future oa 
praesenti, at present. 
3. Conversely a few substantives are sometimes used as adjectives, espe- 
cially verbal nouns in tor and trix: victor exercitus, victricés Athénae, 
a victorious army, victorious Athens; homG gladiator, servus homé, a 
gladiator, a servant; populus laté réx, a people ruling far and wide. 
4, For the use of adjectives with the force of qualifying Genitives, see 437. 
496. Equivalent to a Clause. — Adjectives, like nouns in predi- 
cate apposition, are sometimes equivalent to clauses: 
Alterum vivum améavi, alterum non ddi mortuum, the one I loved while he 
was alive, the other I do not hate now that he is dead ; ©. Off. 3,18. Ab homine 
numquam sdbrid, from a man who is never sober ; C. Ph. 2, 82, 
497. Adjectives and Adverbs. — Adjectives are sometimes used 
where our idiom requires adverbs or adverbial expressions: 
  Sdcratés venénum laetus hausit, Socrates cheerfully drank the poison 3 
Sen. Prov. 3. Quod invitus facid, which I do unwillingly; ©. Rose. A. 42, 123. 
Castris sé pavidus tenébat, he timidly kept himself in camp; L. 3.26. In 
amore est totus, he is wholly in love. Erat ille Romae frequéns, he was 
Frequently at Rome. Senatus frequéns convenit, the senate assembles in 
large numbers ; C. Fam. 10, 12, 3. 
  1. The adjectives chiefly thus used are those expressive of Joy, Knowledge, 
and their opposites, —laetus, libéns, invitus, tristis, sciéns, Insciéns, 
pridéns, impridéns, etc.; also niillus, sdlus, tdtus, tinus, propior, 
proximus, etc. 
2. A few adjectives of Time and Place are sometimes used in the same 
way, though chiefly in the poets: 
Vespertinus pete téctum, at evening seek your abode; WU. E. 1, 6, 20. 
Domesticus Otior, I idle about the house; H. 8. 1, 6, 127. 
8. Note the following special uses of such adjectives as prior, primus, 
princeps, postrémus, ultimus, etc. : 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  248 SYNTAX 
Est primus rogitus sententiam, he was the first to be asked his opinton; 
L. 87,14. Princeps in proelium ibat, he was the jirst to go into battle; L. 21, 4 
4, Certain adjectives, as primus, medius, ultimus, summus, etc., may 
designate a part of an object; as prima nox, the first part of the night; 
summus mons, the top of the mountain. 
5. In rare instances, adverbs seem to supply the place of adjectives; 
Réctissimé sunt omnia, all things are perfectly right; C.¥am.9,9. Nune 
hominum morés, the character of the men of the present day ; Pl. Pers. 885. 
6. Numeral adverbs often occur with titles of office : 
Régulus cdnsul iterum, Regulus when consul for the second time ; ef. C. Of. 
3, 26, 99. 
498. Comparatives and Superlatives. — Latin Compavratives and 
Superlatives are generally best rendered by the corresponding 
English forms, but comparatives may sometimes be rendered by 
somewhat, unusually, too, i.e. more than usual, or more than is 
proper, while superlatives are sometimes best rendered by very: 
Ego miserior sum quam ti, I am more unhappy than you. Senectiis est 
loquacior, old age is somewhat loquacious. Gratissimae mihi tuae litterae 
fuérunt, your letter was very acceptable to me. Quam maximus numerus, 
the largest possible number. Unus omnium doctissimus, without exception, 
the most learned of all. Quantam maximam vastitaitem potest ostendit, he . 
exhibits the greatest possible desolation (as great as the greatest he can); 
L, 22,3. 
  1. Certain superlatives are common as titles of honor: clarissimus, 
nObilissimus, and summus— especially applicable to men of consular or 
senatorial rank; fortissimus, honestissimus, illiistrissimus, and splendi- 
dissimus — especially applicable to those of the equestrian order; 
Pompéius, vir fortissimus et clarissimus, Pompey, a man most brave and 
illustrious ; ©. 1. Ver. 15, 44. Equités Romani, honestissimi viri, the Roman 
knights, most honorable men; ©. 0.1, 8, 21. 
499. Comparatives after Quam.— When an object is said to 
possess one quality in a higher degree than another, the two 
adjectives thus used may be connected by magis quam, the usual 
method in Cicero, or both may be put in the comparative: 
Praeclarum magis est quam difficile, i¢ is more admirable than difficult, or 
admirable rather than difficult; ©. Q. Fr. 1,1, 11. Ditisrés quam fortidrés, 
more wealthy than brave ; L. 89, 1.
-P-A-G-E-265

USE OF PRONOUNS 249 
1. Inasimilar manner, two Adverbs may be connected by magis quam, 
or both may be put in the comparative: 
Magis audacter quam paraté, with more courage than preparation ; ©. Brut. 
68, 241. Bellum fortius quam félicius gerere, to wage war with more valor 
than success. 
2. The form with magis, both in adjectives and in adverbs, may some- 
times be best rendered rather than: 
Ars magis magna quam difficilis, an art extensive rather than dificult. 
3. In the later Latin, the positive sometimes follows quam, even when 
the regular comparative precedes, and sometimes two positives are used: 
Vehementius quam cauté appetere, to seek more eagerly than cautiously ; 
sr. 4. Clari quam vetusti, illustrious rather than ancient. 
  of. Tac. A   
4, For the use of comparatives before quam pr, see 471, 7. 
USE OF PRONOUNS 
500. Personal Pronouns.—The Nominative of Personal Pro- 
nouns is used only for emphasis or contrast: 
Natiiram si sequémur, numquam aberrabimus, if we follow nature, we 
shall never go astray. Ego régés Giéci, vos tyrannds intrédicitis, I have 
banished kings, you introduce tyrants ; Ad Her. 4, 53. 
1. With quidem, the pronoun is usually expressed, but not with equi- 
dem: 
Facis amicé ti quidem, you act indeed in a friendly manner. Non dubi- 
taibam equidem, I did not doubt indeed. 
2. A writer sometimes speaks of himself in the plural, using nés for ego, 
noster for meus, and the plural verb for the singular: 
Vidés nds multa cdnari, you see that Tattempt many things ; ©. Orator, 80, 105. 
Et nostra léctitas, and you often read my writings ; C. Orator, 30,105. Librum 
ad té misimus, J have sent the book to you; ©. Sen. 1, 3. 
3. In Plautus and in Horace, noster, owr friend, occurs in the sense 
of ego: 
Ta mé aliénabis numquam quin noster siem, you shall never make me to 
be any other than myself; Pl. Amph. 399. Subiectior in diem invidiae noster, 
Lam daily more exposed to unpopularity ; U1. 8. 2, 6. 
4, Mei, tui, sul, nostri, and vestri are generally used as Objective 
Genitives; nostrum and vestrum, as Partitive Genitives — though with 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
MRT EL TS re Te ee eee Ne ae ae aT ee eons 
250 SYNTAX 
omnium, and in certain special expressions, nostrum and vestrum are 
used as Possessive Genitives: 
Habétis ducem memorem vestri, oblitum sui, you have a leader mindful 
of you, forgetful of himself; 0.0. 4,9. Uni cuique vestrum, to every one of 
you; ©. Ph. 5,1. Comminis paréns omnium nostrum, the common mother 
of us all; C.C.1, 7. Quantus cdnsénsus vestrum, how great unanimity on 
your part (of you); ©. Ph. 5, 1. 
5. A Personal Pronoun with ab, ad, or apud may designate the Resi- 
dence or Abode of a person: 
Quisnam 4 nobis égreditur fords, who is coming out of our house ? T. Heaut. 
561. Véni ad mé, J came to my house; ©. Att. 16,10. Riri apud sé est, he is 
at his residence in the country ; cf. ©. Or. 1, 49, 214. 
501. Possessives, when not emphatic, are seldom expressed if 
they can be supplied from the context: 
In ed studis aetatem consiimpsi, J have spent my life in this pursuit. Sic 
oculés, sic ille maniis ferébat, thus he moved his eyes, thus his hands. Mea 
domus tibf patet, mihi clausa est, my house is open to you, closed to me; 
©, Rose. A. 50, 145. 
1. Possessives sometimes mean appropriate, proper, favorable, propitious, 
as aliénus sometimes means unsuitable, unfavorable : 
Ego annd med consul factus sum, J was made consul in my own proper 
year (i.e. on reaching the legal age); cf. C. Brut. 94, 328. Ferunt sua flamina 
classem, favoring winds bear the fleet; V.5, 832. Aliénd locd proelium com- 
mittunt, they engage in battle in an unfavorable situation ; Caes. 1, 15. 
2. Remember that the Possessive is regularly used for the Subjective 
Genitive of personal pronouns, and sometimes, though rarely, for the 
Objective Genitive; see 440, 2, Note 2: 
Tua sui memoria délectatur, he is delighted with your recollection of him; 
©. Att. 18, 1,38. Neque odid id fécit tud, nor did he do it from hatred of you; 
T. Ph. 1016. 
8. For the possessive in combination with a Genitive, see 446, 3. 
502. Reflexive Use of Pronouns. — The Personal and Possessive 
Pronouns may be used reflexively; sui and suus are regularly 
so used: 
Mé ipse consdlor, I comfort myself; C. Am. 8,10. Ipse sé quisque diligit, 
every one loves himself. Anteposuit suam saliitem meae, he preferred hig 
own safety to mine.

USE OF PRONOUNS 251 
1. Reciprocal Use of Pronouns. — The reciprocal relation which objects 
often sustain to each other may be variously expressed, as by inter nds, 
inter vés, and inter sé, each other, one another, together; by the reflexive 
sui with ipsi; by alius alium or alter alterum; and by repeating the 
noun in an oblique case: ; 
Pueri amant inter sé, the boys love one another. Milités sibi ipsi sunt im- 
pediment6, the soldiers are a hindrance to one another. Alius alium domés 
suas invitant, they invite one another to their homes. Hominés hominibus 
Utilés esse possunt, men can be useful to men (i.e. to one another). 
  503. In simple sentences and in principal clauses, sui and suus 
generally refer to the subject: : 
Per sé quisque sibi carus est, every one is by his own nature (per sé, 
through or of himself) dear to himself; ©. Am. 21, 80. Caesar cdpids suds 
divisit, Caesar divided his forces. 
1. As sui and suus generally refer to the subject, the demonstratives 
is, ille, etc., are generally used to refer to other words in the sentence: 
Deum agnoscis ex operibus Gius, you recognize God by (from) his works. 
2. Synesis.— When the subject of the verb is not the real agent of 
the action, sui and suus may refer to that agent: 
A Caesare invitor sibf ut sim légatus, I am invited by Caesar (real agent) 
to be lieutenant to him ; ©. Att. 2, 18. 
3. With such indefinite and impersonal expressions as the following, 
sui and suus refer to some indefinite person conceived as the author of 
the action: 
Défdrme est dé sé praedicare,! to boast of one’s self is unseemly ; C. Off. 1, 
38, 187. Perventum ad suds erat,! they had come to their friends ; L. 83, 8. 
4, Suus, meaning his own, their own, fitting, etc., especially with quis- 
que, and the plural of suus, meaning his friends, their friends, their pos- 
sessions, etc., are used with great freedom, often referring to oblique cases : 
Tastitia suum cuique distribuit, Justice gives to every one his due (his 
own); ©. N. D. 3,15. Sud cuique iidicid est iitendum, every one must use 
his own judgment; C. N. D. 3,1. Cdnserva tuis suds, for the sake of your 
Friends, spare their friends ; ©. Lig. 11, 33.   
504. In Subordinate Clauses expressing the Thought, Wish, or 
Purpose of the principal clause, as in the Infinitive clause, final 
  
1 Here observe that the reflexives s6 and su6s refer to the indefinite agents 
of the action expressed by praedicare and perventum erat.
-P-A-G-E-268
  252 SYNTAX 
clause, indirect questions, and the like, sui and suus generally 
refer to the subject of the principal clause; in all other subordi- 
nate clauses, they generally refer to the subject of their own 
clause, and are called Direct Reflexives: 
Sentit animus sé vi sua movéri, the soul perceives that it is moved by its 
own power; ©. Tuse. 1, 23,55, Ubii drant ut sibl parcat, the Ubit ask him to 
spare them. Pervéstigat quid sui civés cégitent, he tries to ascertain what 
his fellow-citizens think. Néminem cdgnbvi poétam, qui sibi non optimus 
vidérétur, I have known no poet who did not seem to himself to be the best ; 
©. Tuse. 5, 22, 68. 
1. After verbs of Advising, Exhorting, etc., sui and suus generally 
refer to the Subordinate Subject, as the person in whose interest the 
advice is given: 
Nervids hortatur né sui liberandi occdsidnem dimittant, he exhorts the 
Nervii not to lose the opportunity of freeing themselves ; Caes. 5, 83. 
2. Two Reflexives. — Sometimes a clause has one reflexive referring to 
the Principal subject, and another referring to the Subordinate subject : 
Respondit néminem sécum sine sua pernicié contendisse, he replied that 
no one had fought with him without (his) destruction ; Caes. 1, 36. 
3. When the Reflexive refers to the Subordinate subject, the Demon- 
strative or Determinative refers to the Principal subject: 
Persuadent Tulingis uti oppidis suis exiistis tina cum iis proficiscantur, 
they persuaded the Tulingi that, having burned their towns, they should 
depart with them ; Caes. 1,5, 4. 
4. Reflexives are sometimes used with participles, referring to the 
agent of the action implied in them: 
Hune réx excépit diffidentemque ! rébus suis confirmavit, the king received 
him and encouraged him when he had lost confidence in his own strength ; 
C. Man. 9, 23. : 
5. Reflexives are sometimes used idiomatically with a few prepositions, 
especially with per, propter, cum, in: 
Valétiidinem ipsam propter sé expetémus, we shall seek health for itself; 
C. Fin. 5, 17. Caesar Fabium cum sua? legiéne remittit, Caesar sends back 
Fabius with (having) his. legion; 0 Jaes. 5, 53. 
  1 Observe that if an ‘equivalent subordinate clause be substituted for the parti- 
ciple diffidentem, as in the translation, the reflexive would be entirely in order, 
and would refer to the subject of its own clause. 
2 Observe that cum legidne sua is equivalent to legisnem suam ha- 
bentem, in which the use of the reflexive is the same as that described above 
under number 4,

DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 253 
DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 
505. Hie, iste, ille, are often called, respectively, demonstratives 
of the first, second, and third persons, as hic designates that which 
is near the speaker ; iste, that which is near the person addressed ; 
and ille, that which is remote from both: 
Iovem, ciistédem hiiius urbis, Jupiter the guardian of this (our) city. 
Mita istam mentem, change that purpose of yours. Tllds quis vidére non pos 
sumus neglegis, you disregard those whom we can not see. 
1. Hic designates an object conceived as near, and ille as remote, 
whether in space, time, or thought: 
Non antiqué ill6 more, sed hdc nostré éruditus, educated not in the manner 
of the olden times, but in this our modern way ; ©. Brut. 35, 182. 
506. Former and Latter. — In reference to two objects previously 
mentioned, 
1. Hic generally follows ille and refers to the latter object, while ille 
refers to the former: 
Acerbis inimicés . . . eds amicés . . . illi vérum saepe dicunt, hi numquam, 
bitter enemies . . . those friends . . . the former often speak the truth, the latter 
never ; cf. ©, Am, 24, 90. 
2. Hic refers to the former object when that object is conceived of as 
near in thought, either because of its importance or because of its close 
connection with the subject under discussion. It may then stand either 
before or after ille : 
Melior est certa pax quam spérata victoria; haec in tua, illa in dedrum 
manii est, sure peace is better than hoped-for victory; the former is in your 
own hand, the latter in that of the gods; L. 30, 30. Senex... aduléscéns 
... ille vult dit vivere, hic dit vixit, the aged man... the young man... 
the latter wishes to live a long time; the former has lived a long time; 
C. Sen. 19, 68. 
507. Other Uses of Demonstratives. — Hic and ille are often used 
of what belongs to the immediate context’: 
Haec quae scribé et illa quae antea questus sum, these things which I am 
writing and those of which I before complained ; 8. 24,9. His verbis epistulam 
misit, he sent a letter in these (the following) words ; N. 2, 9,1. 
1. Hic et ille, ille aut ille, etc., this and that, that or that, are sometimes 
used in the sense one or two, one or another: 
Hoc signum et illud, this statue and that, one or two statues.
-P-A-G-E-270
  254 SYNTAX 
2. Hic, as a demonstrative of the first person, is sometimes, especially in 
poetry, equivalent to meus or noster; and hic homé6, rarely hic alone, 
to ego: 
Supra hane memoriam, before our time (this memory); Caes. 6, 19. Hic 
homést (hom6 est) omnium hominum praecipuos, this man (myself) is the 
most favored of all men; PI. Trin. 1115. Hune hominem vellés si tradere, if 
you were willing to introduce me (this man); H. 8. 1, 9, 47. 
3. Iste, as a demonstrative of the second person, is often applied to an 
opponent, or to a defendant in a court of justice; accordingly the idea of 
Disrespect or Contempt seems at times to be associated with it, though not 
strictly contained in the pronoun itself: 
Quae est ista praetiira, what sort of praetorship is that of yours ? ©. Ver. 
2, 18,46, Animi est ista mollitia, nn virtiis, that is an effeminate spirit, 
not valor. 
4, Ille is often used of what is well known, famous, and in that sense it 
is sometimes in apposition with a Personal pronoun : 
Magnus ille Alexander, that famous Alexander the Great; ©. Arch. 10, 24. 
Ille ego liber, ille ferdx tacui, J, that unrestrained, that fearless one, was 
silent. 
5. Ile is sometimes nearly or quite redundant, especially with quidem : 
Apolldnius ille quidem sud cdnsilid, sed etiam mé auctore est profectus, 
Apollonius set out of his own free will indeed, but also with my advice ; 
C. Fam, 13,16. Qui vénit, multum ille et terris iactatus et altd, who came, after 
having been much tossed about on land and sea; V.1,1. 
6. A demonstrative is sometimes equivalent to a Genitive or to a prepo- 
sition with its case: hic amor = amor hiiius rei, the love of this; haec 
ciira = ciira dé hic, care concerning this: 
Ea formidine multi mortalés Romanis dediti obsidés, from the fear of these 
things many were delivered as hostages to the Romans ; 8. 54, 6. 
7. Adverbs derived from demonstratives share the distinctive meanings of 
the pronouns themselves : 
Hic pliis mali est, quam illic boni, there is more of evil here than of good 
there; T. And. 720. 
DETERMINATIVE PRONOUNS 
508. Is and idem refer to preceding nouns, or are the ante- 
cedents of relatives : 
Dionysius aufigit ; is est in provincia tua, Dionysius has fled; he is in your 
province. Hominés id quod volunt crédunt, men believe that which they

Unam rem explicabo, eamque maximam, one thing I will explain, and that 
too a very important one. Audire Cratippum, idque Athénis, to hear Cra- 
tippus, and that too at Athens ; ef. C. Off. 1, 1. 
8. Idem is sometimes best rendered also, at the same time, both, yet: 
Qui fortis est, idem est fidéns, he who is brave, is also confident. Cum 
optimam natiiram dei dicat esse, negat idem, etc., though he says that the 
nature of God is most excellent, he yet denies, etc.; C. N. D. 1, 43, 121. Rex 
Anius, réx idem hominum Phoebique sacerdés, King Anius, both king of 
men and priest of Apollo; V.3, 80.

509. Ipse adds emphasis, generally rendered self: 
Quod ipse Caesar cdgniverat, which Caesar himself had ascertained. Tpse 
pater fulmina molitur, the father himself (Jupiter) hurls the thunderbolts. 
Ipse dixit!; ipse autem erat Pythagoras, he himself said it; but he was 
Pythagoras. 
1. Ipse belongs to the emphatic word, whether subject or object, but with 
a preference for the subject when no special emphasis rests on the object: 
  
1 Applied to Pythagoras by his disciples. Ipse is often thus used of a superior, 
as of a master, teacher, etc.
-P-A-G-E-272
  
256 SYNTAX 
Mé ipse cdnsdlor, I myself (not another) comfort myself. Tpse sé quisque 
diligit, every one loves himself. Sé ipse! interfécit, he himself killed himself. 
Sé ipsum ! interfécit, he killed himself (not another). 
2. Ipse is sometimes accompanied by sécum, with himself, alone, or by 
per sé, by himself, unaided, in and of himself, etc.: 
Aliud genitor sécum ipse voliitat, the father himself is pondering with 
himself another plan. Virtiis est per sé ipsa laudabilis, virtue itself is praise- 
worthy in and of itself. 
3. Ipse is often best rendered by very: 
Sum profectus ipso illd dié, I set out on that very day. 
4, With numerals, ipse means just so many, just; so also in nunc 
ipsum, just at this time; tum ipsum, just at that time: 
Triginta diés erant ipsi, it was just thirty days. Nunc ipsum sine té esse 
ndn possum, just at this time I cannot be without you ; C. Att. 12, 16. 
5. Ipse, in the Genitive, with a possessive, means own, one’s own: 
Contentus nostra ipsdrum amicitid, satisfied with our own friendship ; 
©. Fam. 6, 16. 
6. Ipse, in subordinate clauses, sometimes refers to the principal subject 
with the force of an emphatic sui or suus: 
Légitds misit* qui ipsi vitam peterent, he sent messengers to beg life for 
himself. 
7. Ipse quoque and et ipse? are often best rendered also, likewise, even he: 
Ipsi quoque vultis, you also wish it. Alius Achillés natus et ipse dea, 
another Achilles likewise (himself also) born of a goddess; V. 6, 89. 
8. For the use of the Nominative ipse in connection with the Ablative 
Absolute, see 489, 8. 
RELATIVE PRONOUNS 
* §10. The relative is often used where the English idiom requires 
a demonstrative or personal pronoun, with or without and, or but, 
sometimes even at the beginning of a sentence: 
Peritilés Xenophdntis libri sunt ; quis legite studidsé, the books of Xeno- 
phon are very useful ; read them attentively ; 0. Sen. 17,59. Qui cum equitatt 
  
1In the example with ipse, the emphasis is on the subject, he himself killed ; * 
in the example with ipsum, the emphasis is on the object, killed himself. 
2 Et ipse, not in Caesar, rare in Cicero, is found in poets, in Livy, and in late 
writers.
-P-A-G-E-273
  
RELATIVE PRONOUNS 257 
Helvétisrum proelium committunt, they engage in battle with the cavalry of 
the Helvetii ; Caés. 1, 15,2. Quae cum ita sint, since these things are 80; 
C. Mur. 1. 2. * 
1. Relatives and Demonstratives are often correlatives to each other: 
hic... qui, iste ... qui, etc. These combinations generally retain the 
ordinary force of the separate words: 
Quam quisque ndrit artem,! in hac s® exerceat, let every one practice 
(exercise himself in) the art which he understands. Istum? quem quaeris, 
ego sum, I am that person whom you seek ;. Pl. Cure, 419. 
2. In Two Successive Clauses, the relative may be expressed in both, or 
it may be expressed in the first, and omitted in the second, when the case of 
the two relatives is the same; or, finally, it may be expressed in the first, 
and followed by a demonstrative in the second: 
Nos qui sermoni nén interfuissémus et quibus Cotta sententias trididisset, 
we who had not been present at the conversation, and to whom Cotta had 
reported the opinions; ©. Or.8, 4,16. Dumnorigi, qui principaitum obtinébat 
ac plébi acceptus erat,? persuaddet, he persuades Dumnorix, who held the 
chief authority, and who was a favorite of the common people (acceptable 
to); Caes.1,8,5. Quae nec habérémus nec iis iterémur, which we should 
neither have nor use ; C. Off. 2, 8, 12. 
3. Several relatives may stand in successive clauses: 
In mundé deus inest aliquis, qui regat, qui gubernet, qui cursiis astrdrum 
conservet, there is a God in the world, who rules, who governs, who preserves 
the courses of the stars; ©. N. D. 1, 20, 52. 
4, Relative with Adjective. — Adjectives belonging in sense to the 
antecedent, especially Comparatives, Superlatives, and Numerals, some- 
times stand in the relative clause in agreement with the relative : 
Vasa, quae pulcherrima viderat, the most beautiful vessels which he had 
seen (which the most beautiful he had seen). Dé servis suis, quem habuit 
fidélissimum, misit, he sent the most faithful of the servants which he had. 
5. When both antecedent and relative depend on the same preposition, 
especially when the two clauses have the same predicate, the preposition 
may be omitted before the relative : 
Incidit in eandem invidiam, quam‘ pater suus, he incurred (fell into) the 
same unpopularity as his father ; N.5, 8. 
  
1 Observe that the relative clause contains the antecedent artem. 
2Istum attracted into the case of the relative, see 399, 5. 
8 Observe that, if the relative had been expressed, it would have been in the 
same case as qui in the first clause. 
4 Observe that quam depends on the preposition in understood.

  258 _ SYNTAX 
6. Relative clauses in Latin, with or without antecedents, are sometimes 
equivalent to nouns, adjectives, or participles in English, as, ii qui audiunt, 
those who hear, hearers; hominés qui nunc sunt, men of the present gen- 
eration, our contemporaries; ii, qués supra dixi, the above-mentioned 
persons :   
Politus iis artibus, quas qui tenent, éruditi appellantur, accomplished in 
those arts whose possessors are called learned ; ©. Fin. 1, 7, 26. 
7. Qui dicitur, qui vocatur, or the corresponding active, quem dicunt, 
quem vocant, etc., are often used in the sense of so called, the so-called, 
what they or you call, ete. : 
Vestra, quae dicitur, vita mors est, your so-called (your which is called) life 
is death. Léx ista, quam vocis, non est léx, that law, as you call it, is not 
a law; ©. Dom. 19, 50. 
8. A Relative Clause is sometimes equivalent to the Ablative with pro. 
Quae tua priidentia est = qua es pridentia = pro tua pridentid means 
such is your prudence, or in accordance with your prudence : 
Spérd, quae tua priidentia est, té valére, I hope you are well, such is your 
prudence (which is, etc.); ©. Att. 6, 9, 1. 
9. The neuter quod, used as an adverbial Accusative, often stands at the 
beginning of a sentence or clause, especially before si, ni, nisi, etsi, and 
sometimes before quia, quoniam, utinam, etc., to indicate a close connec- 
tion with what precedes. In translating, it is sometimes best omitted, and 
sometimes best rendered by now, in fact, but, and: 
Quod si forte ceciderint, but if, perchance, they should fall; ©. Am. 15, 58. 
Quod si ego rescivissem id prius, now, if I had learned this sooner ; 'T. And. 258. 
10. The neuter quicquid, of the general relative, accompanied by an 
adjective, a participle, or a Genitive, may be used of persons: 
Matrés et quicquid técum invalidum est délige, select the mothers and 
whatever feeble persons there are with you; V.5, 715. 
11. The Relative Adverbs qué, ubi, and unde are sometimes used of 
persons, instead of relative pronouns with prepositions: 
Apud eds qui sé contulit, among those to whom he betook himself. Is unde 
18 audisse dicis, he from whom you say that you heard it; C. Or. 2,70, 285. 
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS 
511. The Interrogatives quis and quid are generally used as 
substantives, who? what person? what? what thing? Qui and 
quod are generally used as adjectives, what? of what kind, sort, 
vr character?
-P-A-G-E-275
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS 259 
Quis clarior Themistocle, who more illustrious than Themistocles? Quis 
ego sum, who amI? Quid ego dicd, what am I saying ? Qui locus est, 
quod tempus, what place is there? what time? In qua urbe vivimus, in 
what sort of a city are we living ? 
1. This distinction between quis and qui, quid and quod, was almost 
or quite unknown in early Latin, and it is not always observed even by 
Cicero: 
Quis hom6 té rapit, what man is seizing you ? Pl. Rud. 870. Quis réx 
umquam fuit, what king was there ever ? C. Div. 1, 43, 95. 
2. Which of two is generally expressed by uter. Which one of a larger 
number is expressed by quis : 
Quaeritur, ex dudbus, uter dignior ; ex pliiribus, quis dignissimus ; of two, 
we ask, which is the more worthy; of a larger number, who is the most 
worthy ; Quint. 7, 4, 21. 
3. Two Interrogatives sometimes occur in the same clause: 
Quis quem fraudavit, who defrauded, and whom did he defraud (who 
defrauded whom)? C. Rose. C. 7, 21. 
4. Tantus sometimes accompanies the Interrogative Pronoun : 
Qui tantus fuit labor, what so great labor was there ? ©. Dom. 11, 27. 
5. Quid, why ? how is that ? is often used adverbially, or stands appar- 
ently unconnected: quid enim, why then ? what then ? what indeed ? quid 
ita, why so? quid quod, what of the fact that ? quid si, what if ? 
Loquere, quid vénisti, say, why have. you come ? Quid? ndnne respondé- 
bis, what? will you not reply? Quid quod délectantur, what of the fact 
that they are delighted ? ©. Fin: 5, 19, 52. 
INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 
512. Quis, ali-quis, quis-piam, and qui-dam may be conveniently 
grouped together. Of these, quis, any one, is the most indefinite, 
and quidam, a certain one, the least indefinite, while aliquis and 
quispiam, some one, not distinguished from each other in meaning, 
are less indefinite than quis, but more so than quidam: 
Si qua civitas fécisset aliquid Gius modi, if any state had done anything 
of this kind. Num quid vis aliud, do you wish anything else ? Ponere iubé- 
bam, dé qué quis audire vellet, I asked any one to name the subject about 
which he (any one) might wish to hear; C. Tuse.1,4,7. Forsitan aliquis éius 
modi quippiam fécerit, perhaps some one may have done something of the kind. 
Est aliquod niimen, there is a divinity. Accurrit quidam, notus mihi nomine 
tantum, @ certain one runs up, known to me only by name; H. 8.1, 9,8.
-P-A-G-E-276
  260 SYNTAX 
1. Quis as a substantive, and qui as an adjective, are used chiefly after 
si, nisi, né, num, and in Relative clauses; see the first three examples 
above. They sometimes stand in the relative clause, even when logically 
they seem to belong to the antecedent clause, as in the third example. 
2. Most of the forms of aliquis may be used either as nouns or as adjec- 
tives, but aliquid is a noun, and aliquod an adjective. Aliquis and aliqui 
sometimes mean some person or thing of importance, note, or value: 
Audé aliquid, si vis esse aliquis, dare something, if you wish to be any- 
body ; lav. 1, 73. 
3. Aliquis seems at times to mean many a one: 
Dixerat aliquis sententiam, many a one had expressed his opinion; Caes. 
G1; 9s : 
4, Aliquis is sometimes used with numerals to denote an approximate 
number, chiefly in familiar Latin : 
Aliquis viginti diés, some twenty days. 
5. Quidam, with an adjective, is sometimes used to qualify or soften the 
statement: 
Est gloria solida quaedam rés, glory is a somewhat substantial thing. 
6. Quidam with quasi has the force of a certain, a kind of, as it were: 
Quasi quaedam Socratica medicina, a kind of Socratic medicine, as it 
were. 
7. Nesci6d quis and nesci6 qui often supply the place of indefinite pro- 
nouns, especially in poetry : 
Hic nescid quis loquitur, here some one (I know not who) speaks. 
§13. Quis-quam, any one whatever, is more general in its mean- 
ing than the simple quis, any one. ‘This pronoun and the pronom- 
inal adjective @llus are used chiefly in negative and conditional 
sentences, and in interrogative sentences, implying a negative: 
Neque mé quisquam ibi agnovit, and no one whatever recognized me there ; 
©. Tuse. 5, 36, 104. Num cénsés illum animal sine corde esse posse, do you think 
that any animal can be without a heart ? 
1. N&émG is the negative of quisquam, and like quisquam is generally 
used as a noun, though with the designations of persons it may be used as an 
adjective : 
Aut némé aut Catd sapiéns fuit, either no one or Cato was wise. Néminem 
cdgnGvi poétam, I have known no poet ; C. Tuse. 5, 22. 
2. Nillus, the negative of illus, is generally used as an adjective, though 
it regularly supplies the Genitive and Ablative of ném6 :
-P-A-G-E-277
  GENERAL INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 261 
Nilla aptior perséna, no more suitable person. Néminem laesit ; nillius 
auris violavit, he has injured no one; he has shocked no one’s ears; C. Mur. 
40, 87. 
  8. Nillus and nihil are sometimes used for an emphatic n6n ee 
Philotimus nillus vénit, Philotimus did not come ; ©. Att. 11, 24. 
GENERAL INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 
514. Quivis and quilibet mean, any one you wish, any one you * 
please, any one whatever; quisque, every one, each one: 
Quivis hérés pectiniam potuit auferre, any heir whatever might take the 
money. Quidlibet faciat, let him do what he likes. Quod quisque dixit, 
what every one said. 
515. Quisque is very freely used in Latin, but chiefly as 
follows: 
1, After Reflexive, Relative, and Interrogative Pronouns: 
Ipse sé quisque diligit, every one loves himself. Défendat quod quisque 
sentit, let every one defend his convictions (what he thinks), Interest qués 
quisque audiat, i makes a difference whom each one hears; C. Brut. 58, 210. 
2. After Superlatives and Ordinals, where it is generally best rendered 
by all, every; with primus by very, possible : 
Epiciiréds doctissimus quisque contemnit, all the most learned despise the 
Epicureans. Quint6 quoque annd, every four years (every fifth year). Primo 
quoque tempore, at the earliest possible opportunity, the very first. 
38. After tinus, as in tinus quisque, every one, every person: 
Ego névi et tinus quisque vestrum, J know and every one of you knows. 
4. Observe that in all these examples, quisque follows the word with 
which it is associated. This is the usual order, but the reflexive often fol- 
lows in poetry, and sometimes even in classical prose : 
Quod est citiusque maximé suum, which is especially one’s own ; O. Off. 1, 81. 
5. Ut quisque ...ita with the superlative in both clauses is often best 
rendered, the more . the more:    Ut quisque sibi plirimum confidit, ita maximé excellit, the more confidence 
one has in one’s self, the more one excels ; C. Am. 9, 30. 
6. Quotus quisque means, how rarely one, how few: 
Quotus quisque disertus est, how rarely is one eloquent, or how few are 
eloquent ? ©, Plane, 25, 62. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 SYNTAX 
PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES 
516. Alius means another, other ; alter, the one, the other (of two), 
the second, a second. They ave often repeated: alius.. . alius, one 
... Gnother; alii ... alii, some... others; alter... alter, the one 
... the other; alteri.. . alteri, the one party... the other: 
Aliud est male dicere, aliud acciisare, it is one thing to revile, another to 
accuse. Alii gloriae serviunt, alii peciiniae, some are slaves to glory, others 
to money. Altera (filia) occisa, altera capta est, one daughter was slain, the 
other captured; Caes. 1,58. Hamilear, Mars alter, Hamilcar, a second Mars ; 
L. 21, 10,8. Alteri dimicant, alteri timent, one party jights, the other fears. 
1. Alius and alter repeated in different cases, or combined with alias or 
aliter, form various idiomatic expressions, which, if judged by the English 
standard, would seem to be elliptical : 
Alius alium domdés suas invitant, they invite one another to their homes ; 
$. 66,3, Aliter alii vivunt, some live in one way, others in another; C. ad Brut. 
1,13. Illi alias aliud sentiunt, they entertain one opinion at one time, another 
at another ; ©. Or. 2, 7. 
2. The derivative adverbs, alias and aliter, are sometimes repeated as 
correlatives, alias ... alias, at one time... at another time, aliter... 
aliter, in one way . . . in another way. 
Alias bedtus est, alias miser, at one time he is happy, at another, unhappy ; 
ef. ©. Fin, 2, 27, 87. 
8. After alius, aliter, and the like, atque, ac, and et often mean than, 
and nisi, than or except: 
Non alius essem atque nunc sum, J would not be other than Iam; C. Fam. 
1,9, 21. Nihil aliud nisi pax quaesita vidétur, nothing except (other than) 
peace seems to have been sought ; cf. 0. Off. 1, 28, 80. 
4. Uterque means both, each of two. In the plural it generally means 
both, each of two parties, but sometimes both, each of two persons or things ; 
regularly so with nouns which are plural in form but singular in sense : 
Uterque, miter et pater, domi erant, both, mother and father, were at home. 
Utrique victdriam criidéliter*exercébant, both parties made a cruel use of 
victory. E castris utrisque, out of both camps. 
5. Uterque standing in two different cases may mean one. . . the other or 
one another: each... the other: s 
Cum uterque utrique esset in cdnspectil, since they were in sight of one 
another ; Caes. 7, 85,
-P-A-G-E-279
  
VOICES, NUMBERS, AND PERSONS 263 
YY NT. 
USE OF VOICES, NUMBERS, AND PERSONS 
517. The Voices in Latin correspond in their general meaning 
and use to the Active and Passive Voices in English, but orig- 
inally the Passive Voice had a reflexive meaning, like the Greek 
Middle, and was equivalent to the Active with a reflexive pro- 
noun, a meaning which is still retained in a few verbs, especially 
in poetry: 
Lavantur in fliminibus, they bathe (wash themselves) in the rivers ; Caes. 4, 1. 
Carne vescébantur, they lived upon (fed themselves with) flesh; 8.89. Galeam 
induitur, he puts on his helmet ; V. 2,392. Capita vélamur, we veil our heads ; 
V; 8, 545. 
518. Passive Construction.— With transitive verbs, a thought 
may at the pleasure of the writer be expressed either actively or 
passively : 
Deus mundum aedificavit, God made (built) the world. A ded mundus 
aedificatus est, the world was made by God. 
1. Intransitive verbs have regularly only the active voice, but they 
are sometimes used impersonally in the third person singular of the 
passive : 
Curritur ad praetorium, they run to the praetorium (there is running); 
C. Ver. 5, 35, 92. Mihi cum iis vivendum est qudés vici, J must live with those 
whom I have conquered ; ©. 0. 8, 12. 
  2. Some verbs, othérwise intransitive, occasionally form a personal 
passive in poetry: 
Ego cir, adquirere pauca si possum, invideor, why am I envied if I am able 
to add a few words ? H.A.P.55. Nunc tertia vivitur aetas, Tam now living in 
the third age (the third age is being lived); 0. M. 12, 18s. 
8. Deponent Verbs have in general the forms of the Passive Voice with 
the meaning of the Active, or Middle. They have, however, certain forms of 
the Active ; see 222: 
Hoc mirabar, J wondered at this. Plirimis rébus fruimur, we enjoy (de- 
light ourselves with) many things. 
4. For Semi-Deponent Verbs, see 224. 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
  
264 SYNTAX 
PERSON AND NUMBER 
519. In Latin an individual is regularly addressed in the 
singular, but the writer, or speaker, often refers to himself in 
the plural; see 500, 2: 
Sic rard scribis, you write so seldom. Dé céteris saepe dicémus, J shall 
often speak of the other things ; C. Sen. 1, 3. 
1. For the Use of Voice, Number, and Person in Designating a General or 
Indefinite Subject, you, we, people in general, see 388, 3. 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THREE FINITE MOODS 
520. The Indicative Mood, alike in present, past, and future 
time, represents the action of the verb as an actual fact: 
Gloria virtiitem sequitur, glory follows merit. Quoniam dé genere belli 
dixi, nunc dé magnitiidine dicam, since I have spoken of the character of the 
war, I shall now speak of its magnitude. 
521. The Subjunctive Mood represents the action of the verb, 
as Possible, as Desired, or as Willed: 
Forsitan quaeratis, perhaps you may inquire ; ©. Rose. A. 2,5. Waleant civés 
mei, may my fellow citizens be well. Suum quisque nodscat ingenium, let 
every one learn to know his own character ; ©. Off. 1, 81, 114. 
522. The Imperative Mood, like the Subjunctive, represents 
the action as willed or desired, but it is used almost exclu- 
sively in Commands and Prohibitions. Accordingly, in these 
the Imperative and Subjunctive supplement each other; see 560: 
Valétiidinem tuam ciira, take care of your health. Salis populi supréma 
léx esti, the safety of the people shall be (let it be) the supreme law; 
C. Leg. 8,8. Noli imitari malds medicds, do not imitate incompetent physi- 
cians ; C. Fam. 4, 5, 5. 
USE OF THE INDICATIVE 
523. Rule.— The Indicative is used in treating of facts: 
Romulus: septem et triginta régnavit annds, Romulus reigned thirty- 
seven year Nonne nobilitari volunt, do they not wish to be renowned? 
Si haec civitas est, if this is a state,    
-P-A-G-E-281
    
  
USE OF THE INDICATIVE 265 
1. The Indicative thus treats of facts, not only in the form of statements, 
as in the first example, but also in the form of questions, as in the second, 
and of conditions or assumptions, as in the third. 
524. The Indicative, though more common in Principal Clauses, 
is also used in Subordinate Clauses, but only in treating of Facts. 
Thus : 
1. In Relative Clauses: 
Hominés id, quod volunt, crédunt, men believe that which they wish. 
For the Subjunctive in Relative Clauses, see 589. 
2. In Conditional Clauses: 
Si haee civitads est, if this is a state. 
For the Subjunctive in Conditional Sentences, see 578. 
3. In Adversative and Concessive Clauses : 
Quamquam festinas, non est mora longa, although you are in haste, the 
delay is not long. 
For the Subjunctive in Adversative and Concessive Clauses, see 586. 
4. In Causal Clauses : 
Quoniam supplicatis décréta est, since a thanksgiving has been decreed. 
For the Subjunctive in Causal Clauses, see 598. 
5. In Temporal Clauses: 
Cum quiéscunt, probant, while they are silent, they approve. 
For the Subjunctive in Temporal Clauses, see 600. 
525. Special Uses. — Notice the following special uses of the In- 
dicative, apparently somewhat at variance with the English idiom : 
1. In expressions of Duty, Propriety, Ability, and the like; hence in 
the Periphrastic Conjugations, especially in conditional sentences : 
Eum contuméliis onerasti, quem colere débébas,! you have loaded with 
insults one whom you ought to have revered; C. Phil. 2, 38. Non suscipi 
bellum oportuit,! the war should not have been undertaken; L.5,4. Multds 
possum?! bonds virds néminare, J might name (I am able to name) many 
good men}; ©. Tuse. 2,19. Relictiiri agrés erant,! nisi litteras misisset, they 
  
1 In these examples, the peculiarity in the use of the Indicative is only apparent 
Here, as elsewhere, it deals only with facts. Thus, quem colere débébas, 
whom it was your duty, in fact, to revere; oportuit, it was actually proper that 
the war should not be undertaken; possum, I am able, etc,; relicttri erant, 
they were about to leave, or on the point of leaving. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  266 SYNTAX 
would have left their lands if he had not sent a letter; ©. Ver. 3,52. Haec 
condicié non accipienda fuit, this condition should not have been accepted. 
2. The Indicative of the verb sum is often used with longum, 
aequum, aequius, difficile, ifistum, melius, par, iitilius, etc., in such 
expressions as longum est, it would be tedious ; melius erat, it would have 
been better: 
Longum est omnia énumerare proelia, it would be tedious (it is a long task) 
to enumerate all the battles; N. 23,5. Melius fuerat, promissum nén esse 
servatum, it would have been better (it had been better) that the promise 
should not have been kept ; ©. Off. 8, 25. 
3. Pronouns and Relative Adverbs, made general by being doubled, 
or by assuming the suffix cumque, and the Conjunctions sive... sive, 
take the Indicative : 
Quisquis est, is est sapiéns, whoever he may be (is), he ts wise ; C. Tuse. 4,17. 
Hc ultimum, utcumque initum est, proelium fuit, this, however it may have 
been begun, was the last battle; L. 26,6. Veniet tempus, sive. retractabis, 
sive properabis, the time will come whether you may be reluctant or in haste ; 
C. Tuse. 1, 81, 76. 
4, The Historical Tenses of the Indicative, particularly the Pluperfect, 
are sometimes used for effect, to represent, as an actual fact, something 
which is shown by the context never to have become fully so: 
Viceraémus, nisi recépisset Antonium, we should have (we had) conquered,

TENSES OF THE INDICATIVE 
526. The Latin, like the English, distinguishes three periods 
of time, Present, Past, and Future: lego, I am reading; legébam, 
Twas reading ; legam, I shall be reading. 
527. In each of the three periods of time, Present, Past, and 
Future, an action may be represented in three different ways. It 
may be Incomplete, Completed, or Indefinite. An action is said 
to be Indefinite when it is viewed in its simple occurrence with. 
out reference to duration or completion. 
528. The Latin has special forms for Incomplete and Com 
pleted action, but it has no special forms for Indefinite action, as 
is shown in the following:

1. In this table, observe that Indefinite action for Present and Future 
time is denoted by the Present and Future tenses, and for Past time by the 
Historical Perfect. 
Nore.— Observe that the Present and Future may denote either Incomplete 
action, Iam reading, I shall be reading, or Indefinite action, I read, I shail 
read, and the Perfect, either Completed action in Present time, I have read, 
or Indefinite action in Past time, I read. 
530. All the tenses for Incomplete action, the Present, Imperfect, and 
Future, may denote an attempted or intended action: 
Virtiitem accendit, he tries to kindle their valor. Sédabant tumultiis, they 
were trying to quell the seditions, Expodnam consilium, I shall attempt to 
explain my plan. 
531. In the Periphrastie Conjugation, the tenses of the verb sum 
preserve their usual force, and the meaning of any periphrastic form is 
readily obtained by combining the proper meaning of the participle with 
that of the tense. Thus the Present of the Active Periphrastic Conjuga- 
tion denotes a present intention, or an action about to take place, and 
the Perfect, a past intention, or an action which was about to take place; 
the Present of the Passive Periphrastic denotes a present necessity or 
duty, and the Perfect, a past necessity : 
Bellum scriptiirus sum, I am about to write the history of the war. Quid 
futiirum fuit, what would have been (was about to be) the result? Ea faci- 
enda sunt, those things ought to be (must be) done. Haec condicid non 
accipienda fuit, this condition should not have been (was not one that ought 
to be) accepted ; C. Att. 8, 3, 8.
-P-A-G-E-284
268 SYNTAX 
I. Present Indicative 
532. The Present Indicative represents the action of the verb 
as taking place at the present time. It is used 
1. Of actions and events which are actually taking place at the present 
time: 
Ego et Cicerd valémus, Cicero and I are well. 
2. Of actions and events which belong to all time, as, for instance, of 
general truths and customs: 
Nihil est virtiite amabilius, nothing is more lovely than virtue ; ©. Am. 
8,28. Fortés fortiina adiuvat, fortune helps the brave ; T. Ph. 2 
  3. Of past actions and events which the writer, transferring himself to 
the past, represents as taking place before his eyes. It is then called the 
Historical Present, and is generally best rendered by a past tense, as the 
Historical Present is much more common in Latin than in English: 
Duas ibi legidnés cinscribit, he there enrolled two legions. Caes. 1, 10. 
Vall6 moenia circumdat, he surrounded the city with a rampart. 
533. Special Uses. —1. The Present is often used of a present action 
which has been going on for some time, especially after iam dit, iam 
didum, etc.: 
Iam dif igndrd quid agas, I have not known for a long time how you are; 
C, Fam. 7, 9. 
2. The Present is sometimes used of an action really Future, espe- 
cially in animated discourse and in conditions : 
Quam préndimus arcem, what stronghold do we seize, or are we to seize? 
Si vincimus, omnia tiita erunt, if we conquer, all things will be 
; S.C. 58, 9. ¥    
3. The Present in Latin, as in English, may be used of authors whose 
works are extant: 
Xenophon facit Sdcratem disputantem, Xenophon represents Socrates as 
discussing ; ©. N. D. 1, 12, 81. 
4, With dum, while, the Historical Present is generally used, but with 
dum meaning as long as, each tense has its usual force : 
Dum haec geruntur, Caesari niintifitum est, while these things were taking 
place, it was announced to Caesar; Caes.1, 46. Vixit, dum vixit, bene, he 
lived well as long as he lived ; T. Hee. 461. 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  TENSES OF THE INDICATIVE 269 
II. Imperfect Indicative 
534. The Imperfect Indicative represents the action as taking 
place in past time. It is used 
1. Of actions going on at the time of other past actions: 
An tii eras consul, cum mea domus ardébat, or were you consul when my 
house was burning ? C. Pis. 11, 26. 
2. In lively descriptions of scenes, or events : 
Ante oppidum planitiés patébat, before the town extended a plain. Ful- 
gentés gladids vidébant, they saw the gleaming swords; ©. Tuse, 2, 24, 59. 
3. Of Customary or Repeated actions and events, often best rendered 
was wont, ete. : 
Epulabitur more Persirum, he was wont to banquet in the Persian style. 
535. Special Uses.—1. The Imperfect is often used of a past action 
which had been going on for some time, especially with iam, iam dit, 
iam didum, etc.!: 
Domicilium Romae multds iam annds habébat, he had already for many 
years had his residence at Rome ; cf. O. Arch. 4, 7. 
2. The Latin sometimes uses the Imperfect, where the English idiom 
requires the Present ?: 
Pastum animantibus natiira eum, qui cuique aptus erat, comparavit, 
nature has prepared for animals that food which is adapted to each. 
3. For the Imperfect of an Attempted Action, see 580. 
4. For the Imperfet in letters, see 589, 1, 
5. For the Descriptive Inperfect in Na-1ation, see 538, 2. 
III. Future Indicative 
536. The Future Indicative represents the action as one which 
will take place in future time: 
Scribam ad té, J shall write to you. Numquam aberrabimus, we shall never 
go astray. 
1 Observe that the peculiarities of the Present reappear in the Imperfect. This 
arises from the fact that these two tenses are precisely alike in representing the 
action in its progress, and that they differ only in time. The one views the action 
in the present, the other transfers it to the past. 
2 This occurs occasionally in the statement of general truths and in the descrip- 
tion of natural scenes, but in such cases the truth, or the scene, is viewed not 
from the present, as in English, but from the past. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
270 SYNTAX 
1. The Future, like the Present, is sometimes used of General Truths 
and Customs: 
Natiiram si sequémur, numquam aberrabimus, if we follow (shall follow) 
nature, we shall never go astray. 5 
2. In Latin, as in English, the Future Indicative sometimes has the 
force of an Imperative : 
Cirabis et scribés, you will take care and write. 
IV. Perfect Indicative 
537. The Perfect Indicative performs the duties of two tenses, 
originally distinct. 
1. As the Present Perfect or Perfect Definite, it represents the action 
as at present completed, and is rendered by our Perfect with have: 
Dé genere belli dixi, I have spoken of the character of the war. 
2. As the Historical Perfect or Perfect Indefinite, corresponding to 
the Greek Aorist, it represents the action simply as an historical fact: 
Acciisatus est proditidnis, he was accused of treason. 
  538. Special Uses.—1. The Perfect is sometimes used to contrast 
the past with the present, implying that what has been or was true in the — 
past is not true at present. This is especially common with compound 
Passive forms with fui: 
Habuit, ndn habet, he had, but he has not; 0. Tuse. 1,36. Fuit Tium, Zliwm 
has been, or was; V. 2, 825, Bis Ianus clausus fuit, Janus has been twice 
closed ; L. 1, 19. 
2. In Animated Narrative the Perfect usually narrates the leading 
events, and the Imperfect describes the attendant circumstances : 
changed his mode of life, used the Median dress, and feasted in the Persian 
style ; N.4, 8,1. 
3. Conjunctions meaning as soon as, after, —ubi, simul atque, post- 
quam, posteaquam, etc.,— when used of past actions, are generally 
followed by the Perfect or by the Historical Present. The Pluperfect 
is sometimes used, especially to denote the Result of a Completed action: 
Ubi certisrés facti sunt, as soon as they were informed ; Caes.1,7. Simul 
atque intrdductus est, as soon as he was introduced. Posteaquam in Formiand 
sum, as soonas I amin my Formian villa. Simul atque in oppidum vénuerat, 
as soon as he had come into a town; C. Ver. 4, 21, 47
-P-A-G-E-287
TENSES OF THE INDICATIVE 271 
4, Many Latin Perfects may denote either a completed action or the 
Present Result of that action. Thus c6gn6vi may mean either Z have 
learned or I know; consuévi, I have accustomed myself or I am wont; 
doctus sum, J have been taught or I am learned. In this and similar 
cases the Participle practically becomes an Adjective. In a few of these 
verbs the second meaning has mostly supplanted the first, so that the Per- 
fect seems to have the time of the Present, the Pluperfect that of the 
Imperfect, and the Future Perfect that of the Future: 
Novi omnem rem, J know the whole thing. Meminit praeteritorum, he 
remembers the past. Memineram Paullum, I remembered Paullus. Fuit 
doctus ex disciplina Stoicdrum, he was instructed in (out of) the learning 
of the Stoics ; C. Brut. 25, 94. 
5. The Perfect is sometimes used of General Truths, Repeated Actions, 
and Customs. It is then called the Gnomic Perfect?; and if it is used in a 
Subordinate clause, the Present is generally retained in the Principal clause, 
though in Poetry and Late Prose the Perfect sometimes occurs : 
Peciiniam ném6 sapiéns concupivit, no wise man too eagerly desires (has 
desired) money; 8. C. 11, 3. Omnia sunt incerta, cum 4 itire discessum est, 
all things are uncertain, whenever one departs from the right; ©. Fam. 9, 16. 
Omne tulit pinctum qui miscuit iitile dulci, he wins (has won) every vote 
who combines the useful with the agreeable ; H. A. P. 343, 
6. The Perfect with paene, prope, may often be rendered by might, 
would, or by the Pluperfect Indicative : 
Britum nédn minus amd, paene dixi, quam té, I love Brutus not less, I 
might almost say, than I love you; ©. Att. 5, 20. 
7. For the Perfect in letters, see 589, 1. 
V. Pluperfect Indicative 
539. The Pluperfect Indicative represents the action as com- 
pleted at the time of some other past action, cither already 
mentioned or to be mentioned in a subsequent clause: 
Pyrrhi temporibus iam Apolld versiis facere désierat, in the time of Pyr- 
rhus, Apollo had already ceased to make verses. Codpias quas prd oppidd 
collocaverat, in oppidum recipit, he received into the town the forces which he 
had stationed in front of the town. 
  
1 Literally has recalled, and so remembers, as the result of the act. The Latin 
presents the completed act; the English, the result. 
2 This use of the Latin Perfect corresponds to the Gnomic Aorist in Greek.

272 SYNTAX 
1. In letters the writer often adapts the tense to the time of the 
reader, using the Imperfect or Perfect of present actions and events, 
and the Pluperfect of those which are past. This change —which is 
by no means uniformly made, but is subject to the pleasure of the 
writer — is most common near the beginning and the end of letters: 
Nihil habébam quod scriberem ; ad tuas omnés rescripseram pridié, I have 
(had) nothing to write; I replied to all your letters yesterday; ©. Att. 9, 10. 
Pridié Idiis haec scripsi; ed dié apud Pompdnium eram cénatiirus, I write 
this on the day before the Ides; Iam going to dine to-day with Pomponius ; 
C. Q. Fr. 2, 8, 7. 
Norr.— Observe that the adverbs and the adverbial expressions are also 
adapted to the time of the reader. Heri, yesterday, becomes to the reader 
pridié, the day before, i.e. the day before the writing of the latter. In the 
same way hodié, to-day, this day, becomes to the reader e6 dié, that day. 
2. The Pluperfect after cum, si, etc., is often used of Repeated 
Actions, General Truths, and Customs: 
Cum quaepiam cohors impetum fécerat, hostés refugiébant, whenever any 
cohort made (had made) an attack, the enemy retreated ; Cues. 5, 35. 
3. The Pluperfect may state what had been true at some previous past 
time, implying that it was no longer true at the time of the writer. This 
is especially common with compound Passive forms with fueram : 
Pons, qui fuerat interruptus, paene erat refectus,? the bridge which had 
been broken down was (had been) almost repaired. 
4, For the special use of the Pluperfect in general, see 525, 4. 
5. For the Pluperfect of Special verbs, see 588, 4. 
VI. Future Perfect Indicative 
540. The Future Perfect Indicative represents the action as 
one which will be completed at some future time: 
Rdmam cum yénerd, quae perspexerd, scribam ad té, when I reach (shall 
have reached) Rome, I shall write you what I have (shall have) ascertained ; 
C.Q.Fr.8,7. Ut sémentem féceris, ita metés, as you sow (shall have made the 
sowing), so shall you reap ; C. Or. 2, 65,261. Pliwa scribam, si pliis 6tii habu- 
erd, I shall write more if I have (shall have had) more leisure ; C. Fam. 10, 28. 
  
1The Imperfect of the Periphrastic Conjugation is sometimes thus used of 
future events which are expected to happen before the receipt of the letter. 
Eyents which will be future to the reader as well as to the writer must be 
expressed by the Future. p 
2 Observe that it was no longer a broken (interruptus) bridge, as it had been 
repaired (refectus).

TENSES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE 273 
1. The Future Perfect is sometimes used to denote the Complete Accom- 
plishment of the work : 
Ego meum officium praestiterd, I shall discharge (shall have discharged) 
my duty ; Caes. 4, 25. 
2. The examples here given of the Future Perfect, together with those of 
the Future under 586, illustrate the fact that the Latin is very exact in 
expressing future time and completed action, while the English, in subordi- 
nate clauses, and especially in conditional clauses, often disregards both. 
TENSES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE 
541. The four tenses of the Subjunctive perform the duties of 
the six tenses of the Indicative, and are, accordingly, used as 
follows: 
1. They have in general the same temporal meaning as the corre- 
sponding tenses of the Indicative : 
Sunt qui dicant, there are some who say; 8.C.19. Fuére qui créderent, 
there were some who believed; 8.0.17. Oblitus es quid dixerim, you have 
forgotten what I said; C.N.D.2,1,2. Caesari cum id nintiadtum esset, when 
this had been announced to Caesar ; Caes. 1, 7. 
2. In addition to this general use, these four tenses supply the place 
of the Future and of the Future Perfect, the Present and the Imperfect 
supplying the place of the Future; the Perfect and the Pluperfect, that 
of the Future Perfect, but chiefly in subordinate clauses denoting relative 
time, though the Present, even in principal clauses, often embraces both 
present and future time: 
Erit tempus cum désiderés, the time will come when you will desire; ©. 
Mil. 26, 69. Loquébantur, etiam cum vellet Caesar, sésé ndn esse piignatirés, 
they were saying that they would not fight even when Caesar should wish it ; 
Caes. C.1,72. Egestatem suam sé latirum putat, si hac suspicidne liberatus 
sit, he thinks he will bear his poverty if he shall have been freed from this 
suspicion ; C. Rose. A. 44. Dicébam, simul ac timére désissés, similem té futii- 
rum tui, J was saying that as soon as‘you should cease (shall have ceased) to 
Sear, you would be like yourself; C. Phil. 2, 35. 
    Nore 1.—But the place of the Future may be supplied by the Present 
and Imperfect of the active Periphrastic Conjugation, and is generally so 
supplied when the idea of future time is emphatic; see Table of Subjunctive 
Tenses, 544. 
Nore 2.—In the passive, the place of the Future Perfect is sometimes 
supplied by futiirus sim and futiirus esrem with the Perfect Participle : 
HARK, LAT, GRAM,—19 .  
-P-A-G-E-290
  274 SYNTAX 
Non dubitd quin cdnfecta iam rés futiira sit, J do not doubt that the thing 
will have been already accomplished ; ©. ¥am. 6, 12, 8. 
3. By a transfer of tenses, the Imperfect Subjunctive, in Conditional 
Sentences and in expressions of Wish, refers to Present time, and the 
Pluperfect to Past time: 
Plira scriberem, si possem, I would write more (i.e. now) if I were able 
(but Tam not); ©. Att. 8, 15,3. Si voluisset, dimicasset, if he had wished, he 
would have fought ; N. 2, 8,3. 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE TIME 
542. The time of an action is said to be Absolute when it has 
no reference to the time of any other action, but it is said to be 
Relative when it indicates the Temporal Relation that the action 
sustains to some other action. ‘Thus, in independent clauses, 
the Present, Perfect, and Future express absolute time, but in 
dependent clauses, the Imperfect and Pluperfect, and sometimes 
other tenses, express relative time: 
Hasdrubal tum, cum haec gerébantur, apud Syphacem erat, Hasdrubal, 
at ‘he time when these things were taking place, was with Syphax ; 1. 29, 31. 
Here gerébantur denotes relative time, action going on at the time of 
erat, —Contemporaneous Action. 
Copias quas prd oppids collocaverat, in oppidum recépit, he received into 
the town the forces which he had stationed before it ; Oaes. 7, 71. 
Here collocaverat denotes relative time, action completed at the time of 
recépit, — Prior Action. 
Cupid scire ubi sis hiematiirus, I desire to know where you will spend the 
winter ; C. Fam. 7, 9. 
Here sis hiematirus denotes relative time, action about to take place, 
but still future at the time of cupi6, —Subsequent Action. 
548. In Dependent clauses, the tenses of the Subjunctive gen- 
erally denote relative time, and they may represent the action of 
the verb as going on at the time of the principal verb, Contempo- 
raneous action; as completed at that time, Prior action; or, as 
about to take place, Subsequent action. Moreover, they conform 
to the following rule for

I. That the Subjunctive depen   ent on a Principal Tense is put: 
1. In the Present, to denote Incomplete, or Contemporaneous, action. 
2. In the Perfect, to denote Completed, or Prior, action, and 
8. In the Present, either of the simple, or the periphrastic, form, to 
denote Future, or Subsequent, action:

  II. That the Subjunctive dependent on an Historical Tense 
is put 
1.- In the Imperfect, to denote Incomplete, or Contemporaneous, action. 
2. In the Pluperfect, to denote Completed, or Prior, action ; and 
8. In the Imperfect, either of the simple, or of the periphrastic form, to 
denote Future, or Subsequent, action: 
Quaesivit, salvusne esset clipeus, he asked whether his shield was safe; 
©. Fin. 2, 30,97. Cum tridui viam processisset, nintidtum. est el, when he had

misstiri classem forent, i¢ was uncertain whither they would send the fleet ; 
L. 80, 2. 
PECULIARITIES IN THE SEQUENCE OF TENSES 
546. In the sequence of tenses the Perfect Indicative, the His- 
torical Present, the Present used of authors, and the Historical 
Infinitive are generally Historical tenses, though sometimes used 
as Principal tenses: 
Quoniam quae subsidia habérés exposui,! since I have shown what aids 
you have; Q. ©. Pet. Cons. 4,13. Oblitus es quid dixerim, you have forgotten 
what I said; C.N.D.2,1,2. Persuadet Casticd ut régnum occuparet, he per- 
suaded Casticus to seize the government ; Caes.1,8. Ubii drant ut sibl parcat, 
the Ubii implored him to spare them ; Caes. 6, 9. _ 
547. The Imperfect Subjunctive, even when it refers to present time, 
as in conditional sentences, is generally treated as an Historical tense: 
Si probarem, quae ille diceret, if I approved what he says ; ©. Fin. 1, 8, 27. 
1. In the sequence of tenses the Perfect Subjunctive is generally a Princi- 
pal tense, but in relation to another Subjunctive depending upon it it is gener- 
ally Historical : 
Quaeraimus quae vitia fuerint, quiré is patri displicéret, Jet us inquire 
what were the faults by which he displeased his father ; ©. Rose. A. 14, 41. 
  
1 Observe that exposui and persuadet are treated as historical tenses, while 
oblitus es and Orant are treated as principal tenses.

SUBJUNCTIVE IN INDEPENDENT SENTENCES 277 
Nore. — Here fuerint is a principal tense in relation to quaeramus, but 
in relation to displicéret it is historical. : 
548. The Perfect Infinitive is generally treated as an Historical 
tense, but the Present and the Future Infinitive, the Present and the 
Future Participle, as also Gerunds and Supines, share the tense of the 
verb on which they depend, as they express only relative time : 
Satis docuisse videor, hominis natiira quantd anteiret animantés, I think I 
have sufficiently shown how much the nature of man surpasses (that of) the 
other animals; 0. N. D. 2, 61,158. Spérd fore! ut contingat, I hope it will 
happen ; ©. Tuse. 1,34. Non spéraverat fore ut ad sé déficerent, he had not 
hoped that they would revolt to him; L. 28, 44. Misérunt Delphés cdnsultum 
quidnam facerent, they sent to Delphi to ask what they should do; N. 2, 2. 
549. Clauses containing a General Truth usually conform to the law 
for the sequence of tenses, at variance with the English idiom: 
Quanta cdnscientiae vis esset, ostendit, he showed how great is the power 
of conscience ; O. C. 8, 5, 11. 
550. In clauses denoting Result, or Consequence, the Subjunctive 
tenses have the ordinary temporal force of the corresponding tenses of 
the Indicative : 
Atticus ita vixit, ut Athéniénsibus esset carissimus, he so lived that he 
was very dear to the Athenians ; N. 2,2 Aded excellébat Aristidés absti- 
nentia, ut Itistus sit appellatus, Aristides so excelled in self-control, that he 
has been called the Just ; N. 3,1. 
1. Observe the temporal force of these Subjunctives: esset, was, result 
continuing in past time, the usual force of the Imperfect; sit appellatus, 
has been called, the usual force of the Present Perfect. 
SUBJUNCTIVE IN INDEPENDENT SENTENCES 
551. The Latin Subjunctive performs the duties of two moods 
originally distinct, the Subjunctive and the Optative. It com- 
prises three varieties *: 
  
1 Literally, I hope it will be that it may happen. Here fore shares the tense 
of sp6ér6, and is accordingly followed by the Present, contingat; but below it 
shares the tense of spéraverat, and is followed by the Imperfect, déficerent. 
2 The three varieties of the Latin Subjunctive were all inherited from the 
mother tongue—the Potential and the Optative from the original Optative, and 
the Volitive from the original Subjunctive.

Potential Subjunctive 
552. Rule. — The Potential Subjunctive is used to repre- 
sent the action, not as real, but as Possible or Conditional. 
The negative is nén: 
Forsitan quaeratis, perhaps you may inquire; C. Rose. A.2. Forsitan 
aliquis quippiam fécerit, perhaps some one may have done something ; 
©. Ver. 2, 82, 78. Ita laudem invenias, thus you (any one) may or will win 
praise; T. And. 65. Ubi sdcordiae té tradideris, néquiquam deds implorés, 
when you have given yourself up to sloth, you will implore the gods in vain; 
8.¢.52,29. Eum facile vitare possis, you may easily avoid him ; ©. Ver.1, 15,39. 
Hoc sine alla dubitatione confirmaverim, this I should assert without any 
hesitation; ©. Brut. 6, 25. 
553. In these examples observe that the Potential Subjunctive 
in its widest application includes two vavieties : 
1. The Potential Subjunctive in a strict sense is comparatively rare. 
2. The Conditional Subjunctive represents the action as dependent on a 
condition, expressed or implied, but the condition is often so very vague and 
so fully implied in the mood itself, as in the last two examples, that there is 
no need of supplying it, even in thought, but when it is expressed, the two 
clauses form a regular conditional sentence ; see 572, 573. 
554. On the use of Tenses, observe: 
1. That the Present may be used of Incomplete actions either in Present 
or Future time: quispiam dicat, some one may say, now or at any time ; 
see also 541, 2. 
2. That the Perfect may be used of Completed actions either in Present 
time, as in the second example, or in Future time, as in the last example. 
When used of Future time, it may be compared with the special use of the 
Future Perfect described in 540, 1. Like that it fixes the attention on the 
Completion or the Result of the action, and like that it is used especially in . 
earnest and impassioned discourse. 
3. That the Imperfect is sometimes used in its original meaning as a Past 
tense: tum dicerés, you would then have said, and sometimes in its later
-P-A-G-E-295
  OPTATIVE SUBJUNCTIVE 279 
transferred meaning to represent the statement as contrary to fact: dicerés, 
you would say. The latter is its regular meaning in conditional sentences ; 
see 579. 
555. In simple sentences, the Potential Subjunctive is most 
common in the third person singular with an indefinite subject, 
as aliquis, quispiam, as in the second example under the rule, 
and in the second person singular of the Imperfect, used of an 
indefinite you, meaning one, any one: 
Dicerés, you, any one, would say, or would have said 
Scirés, you, any one would know, or would have known 
Créderés, putarés, you would have believed, would have thought 
Cernerés, vidérés, you would have perceived, would have seen 
Canés vénaticds dicerés, hunting dogs you would have called them; C. Ver. 
4,18, 31. Maesti, créderés victis, redeunt in castra, sad, vanquished you would 
have thought them, they returned to camp ; L. 2, 43. 
556. In the language of Politeness and Modesty, the Potential Sub- 
junctive is often used in the first person of the Present and Imperfect 
of verbs of Wishing, as velim, I should wish; nélim, I should be unwill- 
ing; malim, I should prefer ; vellem, I should wish, or should have 
wished; ndllem, J should be unwilling, or should have been unwilling; 
mallem, J should prefer, or should have preferred: 
Si quid habés certius, velim scire, if you have any tidings, I should like 
to know it; ©. Att.4,10. Ego té salvom vellem, I should wish you safe ; 
Pl. Pseud. 309. Nollem factum, J should not have wished it done ; T. Ad. 165. 
1. For the Subjunctive, with or without ut, dependent upon velim, or 
vellem, see 558, 4; 565. 
557. Potential Questions. — The Potential Subjunctive is used 
in questions to ask, not what 7s, but what is likely to be, what may 
be, would be, or should be: 
Quis dubitet, who would doubt, or who doubts ? Cir ego non laeter, why 
should I not rejoice ? Cir Cornélium nén défenderem, why should I not 
have defended Cornelius ? ©. Vat. 2, 5. 
Optative Subjunctive 
558. Rule. —The Optative Subjunctive is used to express 
pure Desire without any idea of authority, as in prayers and 
wishes. The:negative is né:
-P-A-G-E-296
  280 ; SYNTAX 
Sint incolumés, sint florentés, sint beati, may they be safe, may they be 
prosperous, may they be happy; ©. Mil. 34,93. Stet haec urbs praeclara, may 
this illustrious city stand secure. Id sit quod spérd, may that which I hope 
take place. Illud utinai né scriberem, would that I were not writing this ; 
©. Fam. 5, 17,8. Utinam omnés servare potuisset, would that he had been able 
to save all; C, Ph. 5, 14, 39. 
1. Force of Tenses. —The Present implies that the wish may be fulfilled, 
as in the first three examples; the Imperfect and Pluperfect that it cannot 
be fulfilled, as in the last two examples. 
Nore. —In rare instances in early and familiar Latin the Perfect is used 
to emphasize the Completion of the action, as in 554, 2: 
Utinam haec miita facta sit, may she be (have been made) dumb ; T. And. 463. 
2. Utinam is regularly used, with rare exceptions in poetry, with the 
Imperfect and Pluperfect, and sometimes with the Present. 
3. The first person of the Optative Subjunctive is often found in earnest 
and solemn affirmations : 
Né sim salvus, si aliter scrib6 ac sentid, may I not be safe, if I write other. 
wise than as I think; ©. Att. 16, 13. Sollicitat, ita vivam, mé, as I live, it 
troubles me1; ©. Fam. 16, 20, 
4. Wishes may also be introduced by velim and vellem : 
Velim vérum sit, I wish it may be true; ©. Att. 15,4. Velim mihi igndscas, 
TI wish you would pardon me ; ©. Fam. 13, 7. Vellem vérum fuisset, J wish it 
had been true”; ©. Att. 15, 4. 
5. In early Latin, wishes are sometimes introduced by ut and in poetry 
sometimes, though rarely, by si, or 6 si: 
Ut illum di perdant, would that the gods would destroy him; T. Eun, 802. 
Si nunc sé aureus ramus ostendat, would that (if) the golden branch would 
show itself; V.6,187. O mihi practeritds referat si Iuppiter annds, O if Jupiter 
would restore to me my past years ; V. 8, 560. 
Subjunctive of Will, or Volitive Subjunctive 
559. Rule. — The Volitive Subjunctive is used to repre- 
sent the action, not as real but as Willed. The negative is 
  
1 Here ita vivam means, may I so live, i.e. may I live only in case this state- 
ment, Sollicitat, it troubles me, is true. 
2Here velim and sit were originally independent Subjunctives, meaning I 
should wish, may it be true, the first Subjunctive being potential and the second 
optative, but subsequently the two verbs became so closely united in thought that 
sit became practically the object of velim, I should wish (what?) that it may be 
true. Vellem fuisset has had the same history, 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  ee ee 
SUBJUNCTIVE OF WILL, OR VOLITIVE SUBJUNCTIVE 281 
né. This Subjunctive covers a wide range of feeling and 
comprises the following varieties : 
1. The Hortative Subjunctive, used in Exhortations, but only 
in the first person plural of the Present tense: 
Amémus patriam, cénsulamus bonis, let us love our country, let us con- 
sult for the good; ©. Sest. 68,143. Né diflicilia optémus, let us not desire diffi- 
cult things. 
2. The Imperative or Jussive Subjunctive, used chiefly in the 
third person and generally best rendered by let; but see 560: 
Désinant insidiari domi suae cdnsuli, let them cease to lie in wait for the 
consul in his own house ; ©. ©. 1, 18. 
8. The Concessive Subjunctive, used in Admissions and Con- 
cessions : 
Sit ista rés magna, admit that that is (let that be) an important matter. 
Né sit summum malum dolor, grant that pain may not be the greatest 
evil; C. Tusc. 2,5, 14. Age, sit ita factum, well, admit that it took place thus ; 
C. Mil. 19, 49. 
  4. The Deliberative Subjunctive, used in Deliberative or Doubt- 
ing Questions, implying that the speaker is in doubt in regard to 
the proper course to be pursued and that he desires to be directed: 
Quid agam, itidicés, what am I to do, judges? Quid agerem, itidicés, 
what was I to do, judges? C. Sest. 19, 43. Quod mé vertam, whither am I to 
turn? Eloquar an sileam, am I to speak, ov be silent? Rogem té ut veniiis? 
non rogem, am I to ask you to come? am I not to ask you? C. Fam, 14, 4, 3. 
Norr.— The negative né, which always implies a negative wish, is not 
used in deliberative questions, as they ask affirmatively what the wish of the 
hearer is. The negative n6n sometimes occurs, but it always limits some 
particular word and never implies a negative wish: rogem té, is i your 
wish that I should ask you ? nén rogem té, is it your wish that I should 
not ask you ? 
5. Repudiating Questions. —The Subjunctive with or without ut 
is also used in questions which express Surprise or Impatience, 
especially common in Early Latin: 
Ausculta, quaes6, listen, I pray. Ego auscultem tibf, am I to listen to 
you? Pi. Mil. 496. TC ut Ulla rés frangat, how is anything to subdue you? 
0. 0. 1, 9.  
-P-A-G-E-298
I ee eT 
282 SYNTAX 
Nore, — Deliberative and Repudiating questions may be readily distin- 
guished from the Potential questions considered under 557. The latter 
never represent the speaker as in any doubt or perplexity, They are mostly 
rhetorical questions, used for rhetorical effect in place of assertions, as quis 
dubitet, who would doubt ? equivalent to ném6 dubitet, or ném6 dubitat. 
6. The Subjunctive is occasionally used to state what should have been or 
ought to have been : 
Potius diceret, he should have said rather. Restitissés, mortem pignans 
oppetissés, you should have resisted, should have met death in battle; 
©. Sest. 20, 54, 45. 
7. Note the following use of the Subjunctive with nédum, do not think, 4 
not to say, much less : 
Satrapa numquam sufferre siimptiis queat, nédum ti possis, a satrap would 
not be able to bear the expense, much less would you be able (do not think 
that you would); T. Heaut.452. Nec potuérunt, nédum possimus, and they 
were not able, much less should we be able; 0. Clu. 85, 95. « 
  IMPERATIVE SUBJUNCTIVE AND IMPERATIVE 
560. Rule.—In commands the Subjunctive and Impera- 
tive supplement each other, the Imperative being used in 
the second person and the Subjunctive in the third : 
Libera rem piblicam metii, free the republic from fear; C.0.1,8. Per- 
gite, ut facitis, go on, as you are now doing. Suum quisque ndscat 
ingenium, let every one know his own character. Sécernent sé a bonis, let 
them separate themselves from the good ; ©. 0.1, 18. 
1. The second person of the Present Subjunctive may be used of an 
indefinite you, meaning one, any one, and in early Latin and in the poets, 
even of a definite person : 
Ist bond itare, dum adsit, use that blessing of yours, while it ts with you; 
©. Sen. 10,33. Apud nds hodié cénés, dine with us to-day ; Pl. Most. 1129. 
2. The Future Imperative may be used in the sense of the Present, if 
the latter is wanting, as scit6, scitéte, mement6, mement6te, etc.: 
Mementite his esse pertiméscendés, remember that these are to be feared. 
3. An Imperative may supply the place of a Conditional clause: 
Lacesse, iam vidébis furentem, provoke him (if you provoke him), you 
will at once see him frantic.
-P-A-G-E-299
  
Ce ee — 
SUBJUNCTIVE AND IMPERATIVE 283 
4, In Commands involving future rather than present action, and in 
Laws, Orders, Precepts, etc., the Future Imperative is used: 
Rem penditote, you shall consider the subject. Cras petitd, dabitur, ask 
to-morrow, it shall be granted. Saliis populi supréma 1éx estd, the safety of 
the people shall be the supreme law; ©. Leg. 3. 3. 
Nore. —The place of the Future Imperative is sometimes supplied by the 
Future Indicative ; 
Quod optimum vidébitur, faciés, do (you will do) what shall seem best. 
561. Prohibitive Sentences. —In ordinary Prohibitive Sentences 
the following forms occur: 
1. N6li and nélite with the Infinitive. This is the approved form in 
classical prose : 
Nolite id velle quod fieri nén potest, do not desire that which cannot be 
done ; ©. Ph. 7, 8, 25. 
2. Cavé, cavé né, fac né, or né with the Subjunctive. These forms 
are common in early Latin, but rare in classical prose. The Perfect seems 
to emphasize the Completion or the Result of the action : 
Cavé igndsciis, do not pardon, beware of pardoning. Fac né quid aliud 
cirés, do not attend to anything else. .Né conferas culpam in mé, do not 
throw the blame on me; T. Eun. 388. Istd bond iitire, dum adsit ; cum absit, 
né requiras, use your blessing while it is with you; when it is gone, do not 
long for it; C. Sen. 10,33. Iocum né sis aspernatus, do not despise (be not 
having despised) the jest; C. Q. Fr. 2, 10, 5.   Nore. —In prohibitions in Cicero, né with the present Subjunctive is 
used only of general or indefinite subjects, as in the fourth example, and né 
with the Perfect Subjunctive with a definite subject, as in the fifth example, 
is exceedingly rare. 
3. In Prohibitive Laws and Ordinances the Future Imperative is used: 
Hominem mortuum in urbe né sepelitd, néve aritd, thow shalt not bury 
nor burn a dead body in the city ; in ©. Leg. 2, 23. 
4. Negative in Prohibitive Sentences.— The negative, when not con- 
tained in the auxiliary verb n6li, or cavé, is regularly né ; with a connective, 
né-ve, or ne-que. Néve, or not, is the regular connective in classical prose 
between Prohibitive clauses; neque, and not, admissible in prose to connect 
a Prohibitive clause with an affirmative command, is freely used in poetry 
between any two Imperative clauses, whether affirmative or negative ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
Tr er Te ee ee ee ee ee ee 
284 SYNTAX 
Né sepelitd néve writs, do not bury nor burn. Habé tuum negdtium nec 
existima, manage your own business and do not consider}; C. Att. 12, 22,3. 
Né cape nec té civilibus insere bellis, do not take arms and do not involve 
yourself tn civil wars ; 0. M. 8, 116, 
SUBJUNCTIVE IN SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
562. 1. The meaning of the Subjunctive in Subordinate Clauses is 
either precisely the same as in Principal Clauses, or is a natural develop- 
ment from that meaning. The following examples show the process by 
which an Affirmative Subjunctive Clause may pass from the Independent 
to the Dependent construction: 
Independent. — Vérum sit,? may it be true. Velim; vérum sit,? J should 
wish it; may it be true. 
Dependent. — Velim vérum sit, I should wish (what?) that it may be true ; 
©. Att. 15, 4, 4. 
Independent. — Velim ; beatus sis, I should wish it; may you be happy. 
Dependent. — Velim ut beatus sis, J should wish (what?) that you may be 
happy ; ©. Att. 10, 16, 1. 
Nore. — These two examples illustrate the two ways in which Affirmative 
Subjunctive Clauses may be connected with the Principal Clause ; first, 
without any connective whatever, as in velim vérum sit; and, second, 
with the connective ut, as in velim ut beatus sis. With most verbs the 
second is the usual method. 
2. The following examples show the process by which a Negative 
Subjunctive Clause may pass from the Independent to the Dependent 
construction: —* 
Independent. — Ciira; né quid Tulliae désit, see to it; let nothing be 
wanting to Tullia 
Dependent. — Ciira né quid Tulliae désit, see that nothing may be wanting 
to Tullia; ©. Att. 11, 8, 3. 
Independent. — Praedicit ; né légitds dimittant, he gives the order: ‘let 
them not release the envoys.”” 
Dependent. — Praedicit ut né légatds dimittant, he gives the order that 
they shall not release the envoys ; cf. N. 2, 7, 8.       
   
  
1 Observe that this use of neque, nec, and not, after an affirmative clause 
corresponds exactly to our use of ‘and not’ in the same situation : ‘and do not 
consider.” 
2Vé6rum sit, may it be true, is an Independent Subjunctive of Desire in these 
two examples, but in velim vérum sit it has become dependent upon velim, of 
which it is now the object, though it still continues to be a Subjunctive of Desire. 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  SUBJUNCTIVE IN SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES 285 
Nore. —These two examples illustrate the two ways in which Negative 
Subjunctive Clauses may be connected with the Principal Clause: first, 
without any connective whatever, as in ciira né quid Tulliae désit, as 
né belongs to the negative clause itself; and, second, with the connective ut, 
as in praedicit ut né légatGs dimittant. The former is the usual method. 
563. A clause containing an Optative or Volitive Subjunctive, when 
dependent, may become, 
1. A Substantive Clause, generally used as the Object of the Prin- 
cipal verb: 
Velim ut beatus sis, J should wish that you may be happy. 
2. An adverbial Clause, used to denote the Purpose or Intention of 
the action, often called a Final Clause: 
Oportet ésse ut vivas, it is proper to eat in order that you may live. 
OPTATIVE OR VOLITIVE SUBJUNCTIVE IN SUBSTANTIVE 
CLAUSES 
564. Rule. — The Subjunctive, generally with ut or né, may 
be used in Substantive Clauses which involve Purpose: 
I. In Substantive Clauses used as the Objects of Verbs: 
Scribas ad mé@ velim, J wish that you would write to me; ©. Att. 5, 2,8, 
Orant ut sibt pareat, they ask that he would pardon them. Suis imperavit 
né quod télum réicerent, he enjoined upon his men that they should not 
hurl back any weapon ; Caes. 1, 46, 2. 
II. In Substantive Clauses used as Subjects or Predicates : 
In epistula scriptum erat, ut omnia pariret,! that he was to make all 
preparations had been written in the letter; ©. Att. 13, 45,1. Est léx amici- 
tiae, ut idem amici velint, i is a law of friendship, that friends should 
have the same wish; ©. Planc.2,5. Altera est rés ut rés geras magnas, the 
other thing is that you should perform great deeds ; ©. Of. 1, 20, 66. 
1. Subject Clauses sometimes take the Subjunctive without ut, regularly 
with licet and oportet, and generally with necesse est: : 
Sis licet félix,? you may be happy (it is allowed); H. 8, 27,18. Té oportet 
virtiis trahat, virtue ought to attract you; C.R.P. 6,23. Causam habeat, 
necesse est, it is necessary that it should have a cause; ©. Div. 2, 28. 
  
1 The Subjunctive Clause, ut pararet, is the subject of scriptum erat. 
2Sis félix, originally independent of licet, may you be happy. So, too, 
virtiis trahat, independent of oportet, let virtue attract.
-P-A-G-E-302
  286 SYNTAX 
III. In Substantive Clauses used as Appositives to Nouns or 
Pronouns : 
Fécit pacem his condicidnibus, né qui adficerentur exsilid,1 he made 
peace on these terms, that none should be punished with exile; N.8,3. Id 
agunt, ut viri boni esse videantur,! they strive for this, that they may appear 
to be good men; ©. Off. 1, 18. 
SUBJUNCTIVE IN CLAUSES USED AS THE OBJECTS OF VERBS 
565. Verbs meaning to Desire, Wish, Ask, Command, Persuade, 
Determine, Decree, and the like, generally take the Subjunctive in 
Object Clauses : 
Velim ut tibi amicus sit, J wish him to be (that he may be) a friend to 
you; C, Att.10, 16. ‘Té hortor ut dratiénés meas legas, J exhort you to read 
my orations; C.O#.1,1,3. Ord ut hominés consi incolumés, I ask that 
you would keep the men unharmed. Décrévit senatus, ut Opimius vidéret, 
the senate decreed that Opimius should see to it. Huic persuadet uti ad 
hostés transeat, he persuaded him to go over to the enemy. Praedixit ut né 
légatds dimitterent, he charged them not to release the delegates; N. 2, 7,3. 
Hoe té rogd, né démittas animum, néve té obrui sinas, I ask you not to be 
discouraged, and not to permit yourself to be overcome ; ©. Qu. Fr. 1, 1, 4    
1. For the negative connective between Subjunctive Clauses, see 
561, 4. 
2. The regular constructions with vol6, mal6, and n6l6 are the 
Infinitive, with or without a Subject-Accusative, and the Subjunctive 
without ut, though volé and malé sometimes take ut: 
Vérum audire non vult, he does not wish to hear the truth. Mihi crédas 
velim, I wish you to believe me. Id ut facias velim, J wish you to do this. 
3. Iubed and vets regularly take the Accusative and the Infinitive 
in the Active, with the Personal Constructions in the Passive; see 611, 1: 
Helvétids oppida restituere iussit, he ordered the Helvetii to rebuild their 
towns. Ab opere légitds discédere vetuerat, he had forbidden the lieutenants 
to leave (depart from) the work. Tubentur scribere exercitum, they are 
ordered to enroll an army. 
4, Verbs meaning to direct, urge, etc., and the Imperatives fac and 
facité often take the Subjunctive without ut, and cavé sometimes takes 
the Subjunctive without né: 
  
1 The clause né... exsilid, originally a Volitive Subjunctive, is an Appositive 
to condici6nibus and ut... videantur, an Appositive to id.

Labiénd mandat Belgas adeat, he directs Labienus to. visit the Belgae ; 
ef. Caes. 3, 11,2. Fae plané sciam, let me know fully (make that I may know); 
C. Fam. 7,16, Cavé existimés, beware of supposing; CU. ¥am.9, 24. 
5. Verbs meaning to determine, decide, etc.,—statu6, cdnstitus, 
décerné, etc.,— generally take the Subjunctive when a new subject is 
introduced, otherwise the Infinitive (614): 
Senatus décrévit, darent operam cénsulés, the senate decreed that the con- 
suls should attend to it; S.C.29,2. Rhénum trinsire décréverat, he had 
decided to cross the Rhine ; Caes. 4, 17. 
  6. Several other verbs of this class admit either the Subjunctive or 
the Infinitive, but generally with some difference of meaning: 
Persuadébo tibf ut maneds, J shall persuade you to remain. Persua- 
débo tibi hdc vérum esse, I shall convince you that this is true. Moned 
ut maneas, I advise you to remain. Moned té hoc vérum esse, I remind 
you that this is true. 
566. Verbs meaning to Make, Obtain, Hinder, and the like, 
generally take the Subjunctive in Object Clauses: 
Fac ut té ipsum ciistddiiis, make sure that you protect yourself; ©. Fam. 9, 
14,8. Effécit ut imperator mitterétur, he caused a commander to be sent. 
Né mihf noceant, vestrum est prdvidére, it is your duty to see to it that they 
may not injure me; C.C.3, 12. Dil prohibeant ut hoc praesidium existimétur, 
the gods forbid that this should be regarded as a defense ; ©. Rose. A. 52, 151, 
  1. Ut with the Subjunctive sometimes forms with faciS and agé, 
rarely with est, a circumlocution : 
Invitus facid ut recorder, I unwillingly recall (I do unwillingly that I 
recall); C. Vat. 9,21. Invitus féci ut Flimininum 6 senatii éicerem, I reluc- 
tantly expelled Flamininus from the senate ; ©. Sen. 12, 42. 
2. Some verbs of this class which generally take the Subjunctive, 
admit the Infinitive, with or without a Subject, but with a somewhat 
different meaning : 
Ciira ut valedis, take care to be in good health; ©. Att. 11,3. Nihil quod té 
putem scire ciirare, nothing which Ithink you would care to know ; ©. Fam. 9, 10. 
567. Verbs meaning to Fear generally take the Subjunctive in 
Object Clauses: 
Timed ut laborés sustineds, I fear that you will not endure the labors ; 
©. Fam. 14,2. Timed né Gveniant ea, J fear that those things may happen: 
of, OC, Fam, 6, 21. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  288 SYNTAX 
1. The following examples show the process by which a Subjunctive 
clause becomes dependent upon a verb of Fearing. They also show why- 
ut must be rendered that not, and né that or lest: 
Timed ; né éyeniant ea, I fear; may those things not happen. 
Timed né éveniant ea, J fear that, or lest, those things may happen = I fear, 
may they not happen ; negative desire, hence né. 
Timed; veniant ea, I fear; may those things happen. 
Timed ut veniant ea, I fear that those things may not happen =I fear, may 
those things happen; affirmative desire, hence ut. 
2. After verbs of Fearing, né n6n is sometimes used in the sense of 
ut, regularly so after a negative clause: 
Non vereor né hic iiidici non probem, J do not fear thatI may not make: 
this acceptable to the judge; ©. Ver.4, 38, 82. 
3. Verbs of Fearing admit the Infinitive as in English: 
Vereor laudare praesentem, I jear (hesitate) to praise you in your presence. 
4. Various expressions, nearly or quite equivalent to verbs of Fear- 
ing, are also followed by the Subjunctive; as, timor est; metus, ciira, 
periculum est; periculésum est; anxius, pavidus sum; in meti, in 
periculd sum; ciira, timor incédit; pavor capit, etc. : 
Num est periculum né quis putet turpe esse, is there any fear that any one 
may think it to be disgraceful? C.Orat. 42,145, Pavor céperat milités né morti- 
ferum esset vulnus, fear that the wound might be mortal’ had seized the 
soldiers. Né quod bellum orirétur, anxius erat, he was fearful that some war 
might arise. Sunt in metii, né afficiantur poena, they are in fear that they 
may be visited with punishment ; C. Fin. 2, 16, 53. 
VOLITIVE SUBJUNCTIVE IN CLAUSES OF PURPOSE—FINAL 
CLAUSES 
568. Rule.— The Subjunctive is used with ut, né, qué, 
qué minus, quéminus, to denote the Purpose of the aetion : 
Romani ab aratrd abdixérunt Cincinnatum, ut dictator esset, the 
Romans took Cincinnatus from the plow that he might be dictator; ©. Fin. 
2,4,12, Légibus idcircd servimus ut liberi esse possimus, we are servants 
of the laws for this reason, that we may be able to be free; ©. Clu. 58, 146. 
Claudi ciiriam iubet, né quis Egredi possit, he orders the senate house to 
be closed that no one may be able to come out. Medico aliquid dandum 
est, quo sit studidsior, something ought to be given to the physician, that 
(by this means) he may be more attentive. Neque té déterred qué minus:
-P-A-G-E-305
Pe ne ao   
SUBJUNCTIVE IN CLAUSES OF PURPOSE 289 
id disputés, and I am not trying to deter you from discussing (that you may 
less discuss) that point ; ©. Att. 11, 8, 1. 
1. The following examples show the process by which the Volitive 
Subjunctive may become the Subjunctive of Purpose : 
Independent Volitive. —Né quid rés publica détrimenti capiat,! let the 
republic suffer no harm. 
Dependent Volitive = Purpose. —Dent operam consulés né quid rés piblica 
détrimenti capiat,! let the consuls give heed that (in order that) the republic 
may suffer no harm. 
Independent.— Vincat,1 let him conquer. Contendit ; vincat, he is striving ; 
let him conquer. 
Dependent. — Contendit ut vincat,! he strives that he may conquer. 
2. Object Clauses and Final Clauses. — Object clauses and Final clauses, 
as they are both developed from the Volitive Subjunctive, are sometimes 
difficult to distinguish. An Object clause, however, is always the gram- 
matical object of a verb, while a Final clause is never thus used. 
3. Conjunctions introducing Final clauses sometimes have correlatives 
in the Principal clause, as ide6, idcircd, eG, etc., as in the second 
example. 
4. Subjunetive clauses with ut or ne are sometimes inserted paren- 
thetically in sentences : 
Amicds parare, optimam vitae, ut ita dicam, supellectilem, to secure 
friends, the best treasure, so to speak, of life; C. Am. 15. 
5. A clause of purpose may take ut nén when the negative belongs, 
not to the entire clause, but to some particular word: 
Suas copiais prodixit, ut, si vellet Ariovistus, etc., ei potestas non deesset 
(mon deesset = adesset), he led out his forces that, if Ariovistus wished, etc., 
he might not lack the opportunity ; Caes. 1, 48,8. Ut plira non dicam, not to 
say more, or to say no more ; ©. Man. 15, 44. 
6. The negative connective between Subjunctive Clauses, whether 
Substantive or Final, is regularly néve, or neu, but sometimes neque: 
  Légem tulit, né quis acciisarétur, néve multarétur, he proposed a law that 
no one should be accused or punished; N.8,3. Nune ut ea praetermittam,. 
neque eds appellem, quid lucri fiat cogniscite, now, to omit those things, 
and not to call upon those persons, learn what the profit is ; C. Ver. 8, 48, 115. 
  
1 Observe that the negative clause né quid . . . capiat becomes negative 
Purpose without any change whatever, and that the affirmative vincat be- 
comes affirmative Purpose without change, though ut is used to connect it. 
with contendit.

7. Qué, by which, that, sometimes introduces Final Clauses, chiefly 
with comparatives, as in the fourth example. Qué minus is simply qué 
with the comparative minus. 
8. Qué minus, by which the less, that thus the less, that not, is generally 
used with verbs of Hindering, Opposing, Refusing, — déterred, impe. 
did, obstd, prohibed, reciis6, etc., and it always takes the Subjunc+ 
tive. It originally denoted Purpose, but it often introduces Substantive 
Clauses : 
Non reciisivit qué minus poenam subiret, he did not refuse to submit (that 
he might not submit) to punishment ; N. 15,8. Non déterret sapientem mors, 
qué minus rei piblicae consulat, death does not deter a wise man from delib- 
erating for the republic ; ©. Tuse. 1, 38,91. Per eum stetit, qué minus dimica- 
rétur, it was due to his influence (stood through him) that the battle was not 
Fought ; Caes. C. 1, 41, 8. 
POTENTIAL SUBJUNCTIVE IN SUBORDINATE CLAUSES 
569. Rule. — The Potential Subjunctive is used in Subor- 
dinate clauses, whatever the connective, to represent the 
action as Possible or Conditional, rather than real : 
NémG est qui non liberds suds beatds esse cupiat, there is no one who 
would not wish his children to be happy; ©. Inv. 1,30, 48. Quoniam civitati 
cdnsulere non possent, since they would not be able to consult for the state. 
Ubt periclum facias, whenever you (any one) may make the trial ; Pl. Bac. 63. 
1. A clause containing a Potential Subjunctive, when made depend- 
ent, often becomes an Adverbial clause denoting the Result of the 
action: 
Ita vixit ut offenderet néminem, he so lived that he would offend no one, 
or that he offended no one ; ©. Plane. 16, 41. 
2. The following example shows the process by which the Potential 
Subjunctive may become the Subjunctive of Result: 
Independent Potential. — Probitatem in hoste etiam diligamus, we should 
love goodness even in an enemy. 
Dependent Potential = Result. — Tanta vis probitatis est ut eam in hoste 
etiam diligamus, so great is the power of goodness that we should love it even 
in an enemy, or that we love it even in an enemy. 
Nore. —The strict meaning of the Potential Subjunctive diligamus is 
precisely the same both in the Independent and in the Dependent form, viz.
-P-A-G-E-307
ee ee es ee 
SUBJUNCTIVE IN CLAUSES OF RESULT 291 
we should love; but from this primary meaning was developed by way of 
inference a secondary meaning, we love, as we very naturally assume that 
what one would love as a matter of course, one may love as a matter of fact. 
POTENTIAL SUBJUNCTIVE IN CLAUSES OF RESULT— 
CONSECUTIVE CLAUSES 
570. Rule. —'The Potential Subjunctive is used with ut, 
or ut nén, to denote the Result of the action: 
Tale est ut possit itire laudari, it is such that it may be justly praised ; 
©. Fin, 2, 14. Tanta tempestas coorta est, ut nulla navis cursum tenére 
posset, so great a tempest arose that no vessel would be able, or was able, to 
hold its course ; Caes. 4,28. Némo aded ferus est, ut nOn mitéscere possit, 
no one is so fierce that he may not become gentle; U. 4.1, 1,39. Atticus ita 
vixit, ut Athéniénsibus esset carissimus, A tlicus so lived that he was (would 
be) very dear to the Athenians ; N. 2, 2. 
1. The Potential Sabjunctive occurs with quam, with or without ut: 
Indulgébat sibi liberalius, quam ut invidiam posset effugere, he indulged 
himself too freely to be able (more freely than so as to be able) to escape 
unpopularity ; N. 12,3. Imponébat amplius quam ferre possent, he imposed 
more than they would be able, or were able, to bear ; C. Ver. 4, 34, 76. 
2. After tantum abest ut, denoting Result, a second ut-clause of Result 
sometimes occurs: 
Philosophia, tantum abest ut laudétur, ut etiam vituperétur, so far is it 
from the truth (so much is wanting) that philosophy ts praised that it is even 
censured ; C. Tuse. 5, 2, 6. 
3. Ita...ut n6n introduces the Subjunctive of Result, but ita... ut 
né, so that not, on condition that not, introduces the Subjunctive of Purpose : 
Singulis consulatur, sed ita ut ea rés né obsit rei piblicae, let the interests 
of individuals be consulted, but only on condition that this does not harm the 
republic ; ©. Off. 2, 21, 72. 
4. Né with the Subjunctive, denoting the wish or purpose of the writer, 
is sometimes found in clauses of Result : 
Ex qué efficitur, non ut voluptas né sit voluptas, sed ut voluptas non sit 
summum bonum, from which it follows, not (I wish you to understand) that 
pleasure is not pleasure, but that pleasure is not the highest good; C. Fin. 2, 
8, 24. od.
-P-A-G-E-308
  292 SYNTAX 
POTENTIAL SUBJUNCTIVE IN SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES 
571. Rule. — The Potential Subjunctive is often used with 
ut and ut nén in Substantive Clauses! as follows : 
1. In Subject clauses, with certain Impersonal verbs meaning 
it happens, it follows, etc.,—accidit, accédit, -Evenit, fit, efficitur, 
fieri potest, fore, sequitur, etc. : 
Potest fieri ut fallar, it may be that I am deceived; ©. Fam. 13, 73,2. Fit 
ut quisque délectétur, the result is (it comes to pass) that every one is 
delighted. Accidit ut esset lina pléna, it happened that the moon was full. 
Ad senectiitem accédébat ut caecus esset, to age was added the fact that he 
was blind ; ©. Sen. 6,16. Evénit ut ravi essémus, it happened that we were in 
the country. Spérd fore ut contingat id nobis, J hope that this will fall to 
our lot; ©. Tuse. 1, 34. 
2. In Subject clauses with predicate nouns and adjectives: 
M6s est ut nolint, it is their custom to be unwilling; C. Brut. 21, 64. Fuit 
meum officium ut facerem, it was my duty to do it. Veérum est ut bonds 
boni diligant, it is true that the good love the good. Quid tam inerédibile 
quam ut eques Romanus triumpharet, what so incredible as that a Roman 
knight should triumph ? ©. Man, 21, 62. 
38. In Object clauses depending upon faci6, efficis, etc., of the 
action of irrational forces : 
Sol efficit, ut omnia floreant, the sun causes all things to bloom (that all 
things may bloom); ©. N. D. 2, 15, 41. Splendor vester facit ut peccare sine 
periculd non ‘possitis, your conspicuous position causes this result, that you 
cannot err without peril ; ©. Ver. 1, 8, 22. 
  4. In clauses in Apposition with nouns or pronouns: 
Est hoc vitium ut invidia gloriae comes sit, there is this fault, that envy 
is the companion of glory; N. 12,8. Id est proprium civitatis ut sit libera, 
  
1 The Subjunctive, in some of these substantive clauses, was developed directly 
from the independent Potential Subjunctive, as in the first example: independent, 
potest fieri; fallar, it may be; I may be deceived ; dependent, potest fieri ut 
fallar, it may be that I am deceived. In some other examples, it was developed 
through the clause of result, as in the second example. If this is interpreted to 
mean, it is done in such a way that every one is delighted, then ut... délectétur 
is a clause of result, but, if it is interpreted as in the text, it becomes a substan- 
tive clause. In some instances, however, substantive clauses, apparently with 
the Potential Subjunctive, have not been developed in either of these two ways, 
but formed by analogy, after the general type of substantive clauses.

MOODS IN CONDITIONAL SENTENCES.— INDICATIVE AND 
SUBJUNCTIVE 
572. Every Conditional Sentence consists of two distinct parts 
expressed or understood, the Condition or Protasis, and the Con- 
clusion or Apodosis: 
Si negem, mentiar, if I should deny it, I should speak falsely. 
Here si negem is the condition or protasis and mentiar, the conclusion 
or apodosis. 
573. Conditional sentences naturally arrange themselves in 
three distinct classes with well-defined forms and meanings, as 
follows: : 
Class I. — Indicative in both clauses ; Condition assumed as Real : 
Negat quis, negd, some one denies (= if some one), J deny; T. Eun. 251. Si 
quis negat, nego, if some one denies, I deny. 
Class II.— Subjunctive, Present or Perfect, in both clauses; Condi- 
tion assumed as Possible : 
Rogés mé, nihil fortasse respondeam, ask me, I may perhaps make no 
reply ; C.N. D. 1, 21, 57. Si rogés mé, nihil fortasse respondeam, if you should 
ask me, I should perhaps make no reply. 
Class III.—Subjunctive, Imperfect or Pluperfect, in both clauses; 
Condition assumed as Contrary to Fact: 
Ti magnam partem, sineret dolor, habérés, you would have had a large 
share, had grief permitted ; V.6,30. Ti magnam partem, si sineret dolor, 
habérés, you would have had a large share, if grief had permitted. 
Norre.—From these examples it is manifest that a conditional particle, 
as sI, if, although regularly used, is not an essential part of a conditional 
sentence, and that it originally had no influence upon the mood in either 
clause, as the mood in each of these examples without si is the same as in 
the corresponding example with si. Originally the two clauses, the condi- 
tion and the conclusion, were independent of each other, and the mood in 
each was determined by the ordinary principles which regulate the use of 
moods in independent sentences; see 523, 551.

CONDITIONAL SENTENCES. —CLASS I 
Indicative in Both Clauses 
574. Rule. — The Indicative in Conditional Sentences 
with si, nisi, ni, sin, assumes the supposed case as Real : 
Si haec civitas est, civis sum, if this is a state, I am a citizen. Si 
vincimus, omnia nobis tiita erunt, if we conquer, all things will be safe 
for us. Pliira scribam, si pliis dtii habuerd, I shall write more if I shall 
have (had) more leisure. Si féceris id, magnam habébo gratiam; si non 
féceris, ignoscam, if you will do this, I shall have great gratitude ; if you do 
not do it (shall not have done it), I shall pardon you; C. Fam. 5,19. Si licuit, 
peciiniam récté abstulit filius, if it was lawful, the son took the money right- 
fully. Sin certé Gveniet, nila forttina est, but if.it will surely happen, 
there is no uncertainty whatever ; ©. Div. 2,7, 18. Mirum, ni domist (= domi 
est), strange if he is not at home ; T. And. 598,   
1. Force of the Indicative in Conditional Clauses.—The Indicative in 
conditional clauses assumes the supposed case as a fact, but it does not 
necessarily imply that the supposition is in accord with the Actual Fact, 
although it is often used when such is the case, especially with si quidem, 
which often means since: 
Antiquissimum est genus poétarum, si quidem! Homérus fuit ante Romam 
conditam, the class of poets is very ancient, since (if indeed) Homer lived 
before the founding of Rome ; et. Tus. 1, 1, 3. 
2. The Time may be Present, Past, or Future, and it is often the same in 
both clauses, but various combinations of tenses occur ; see examples. 
3. The use of the Future Perfect in both clauses illustrates the fondness 
of the Latin for the forms for completed action : 
Is bellum confécerit qui Anténium oppresserit, he who shall crush Antony, 
will bring this war to a close; C. Fam. 11, 12. 
4, In general the Latin language makes no distinction between Particular 
and General Conditions ; but see 578. 
Force of Conditional Particles 
575. The Condition is generally introduced, when affirmative, 
by si or sin, with or without other particles, as si quidem, si modo, 
sin autem; when negative, by nisi, ni, si non: 
1Si quidem, lit. if indeed, if as it is admitted = since.

Si haec civiias est, civis sum; si non, exsul sum, if this ts a state, Tama 
citizen; if not, Iam an exile; cf. OC. Fam. 7, 8, 5. 
1. The force of si, probably a Locative case, is more clearly seen when it 
is used as the correlative of sic and ita, so, thus, as in the following examples : 
Sic scribés aliquid, si vacabis, so or if you shall have leisure, so you will 
write something ; C. Att. 12,38. Ita senectiis honesta est, si itis retinet, so or 
Uf old age retains its right, so it is honorable ; ©. Sen. 11, 38. 
Norr.—Sic is a compound of si and ce, seen in hi-ce; sic = si-ce. 
SI... sic means so... so. Compare the corresponding use of so in 
English : “So truth be in the field, we do injuriously to misdoubt her 
strength’? (Milton). 
2. Nisi and si n6n are often used without any perceptible difference of 
meaning ; but strictly nisi, if not, with the emphasis on if, means unless, 
and introduces a negative condition, as a qualification or an exception, 
while si n6n, if not, with the emphasis on not, limits the negative to some 
particular word: 
Parvi foris sunt arma, nisi est cdnsilium domi, arms are of little value 
abroad, unless there is wisdom at home ; cf. C. Off. 1, 22,76. Si tibt non gravés 
sumus, refer ad illa té, if we are not troublesome to you, return to those 
topies ; C. Or. 8, 36,147. Here observe that n6n belongs to gravés. 
8. SI nGn, from the nature of its meaning with its emphatic n6n, is used 
chiefly in contrasts : 
Si illud non licet, saltem hc licébit, if that is not lawful, this surely will 
be, T. Eun. 639. 
4, Si minus, sin minus, sin aliter, are sometimes used in the sense of 
si ndn, especially when the verb is omitted : 
SI minus potentem, at probatam tamen et iiistam, if not powerful, at least 
approved and just; C. Fam. 2,6,8. Sin minus poterit, negabit, but if he shall 
not be able, he will deny ; ©. Inv. 2, 29, 88. 
5, Sin and sin autem, but if, are generally used in contrasting clauses, 
whether affirmative or negative : 
Si statim navigds ...; sin té cénfirmare vis, if you sail at once...; but 
of you wish to recover your health ; C. Fam. 16, 1. 
6. Nisior ni, generally if not, unless, is sometimes best rendered but or 
except 
Nesci6, nisi hdc vided, I know not, but I observe this ; C. Rose. A. 85, 99. 
7. Nisi si means except if, unless perhaps, unless : 
Nisi si quis ad mé scripsit, wnless perhaps some one has written to me; 
C. Fam. 14, 2.

8. The condition is sometimes ironical, especially with nisi forte and 
nisi vér6: 
Nisi forte id dubium est, unless perchance this is doubtful ; ©. Ver. 1, 89, 100. 
9. A condition is sometimes implied in a participle, in an ablative abso- 
lute, or even in the oblique case of a noun: 
. Non potestis, voluptate omnia dérigentés, retinére virtiitem, you can not 
retain your manhood, if you arrange all things with reference to pleasure ; 
©. Fin. 2,22, 71. Recté factd, exigua laus propodnitur, if the work is well done, 
small praise is offered; ©. Agr. 2,2,5. Némd sine spé sé offerret ad mortem, 
no one without a hope (=if he had not a hope) would expose himself-to 
death ; C. Tuse, 1, 15, 82. 
10. For Conditional Sentences in the Indirect Discourse, see 646. 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES.— CLASS II 
Subjunctive, Present or Perfect in Both Clauses 
576. Rule.— The Present or Perfect Subjunctive in Con- 
ditional Sentences with si, nisi, ni, sin, assumes the supposed 
case as Possible: 
Diés déficiat, si velim causam défendere, the day would fail me, if I 
should wish to defend the cause; ©. Tuse. 5, 35, 102. Taec si técum patria — 
loquatur, nonne impetrare débeat, if your country should speak thus with 
you, ought she not to obtain her request? 0.0.1,8. Si quid té figerit, ego 
perierim, if anything should escape you, I should be ruined ; T. Meaut. 816. 
1. The time denoted by these tenses, the Present and the Perfect, is either 
Present or Future, and the difference between the two is that the former 
i regards the action in its progress, the latter in its completion ; but the Perfect 
is rare, especially in the conclusion. 
2. In early Latin the Present Subjunctive is often used in conditions con- 
trary to fact: 
Magis id dicas, si scias quod ego scid, you would say this the more, if you 
knew what I know; Pi. Mil. 1429. Ti si hic sis, aliter sentias, if you were in 
my place, you would think differently ; 'T. And. 810. 
Present Subjunctive in Conditional Clauses 
577. Conditional Sentences with the Present Subjunctive in 
the condition exhibit the three following varieties: 
1. The first variety has the Present Subjunctive in both clauses. ‘This 
is the regular form in Plautus, and the prevailing form in classical Latin;

Quod facile patiar, si tué commod6 fieri possit, which I can easily bear, 
af it can be for your advantage ; ©. Att. 2, 17,3. 
2. The second variety has the Present Subjunctive in the Condition 
and the Present Indicative in the Conclusion. This form, somewhat rare 
in Plautus, became the prevailing form in the rhetorical works of Cicero, 
and finally the regular form in Tacitus and other late writers. These 
changes illustrate the gradual extension in principal clauses of the In- 
dicative in constructions once occupied by the Potential Subjunctive : 
Si acciisétur, ndn habet défénsidnem, if he should be accused, he has no 
defense ; C. Iny. 1, 18, 18. Intrare, si possim, castra hostium vold, I wish to 
enter the camp of the enemy, if I may be able. 
3. The third variety has the Present Subjunctive in the Condition 
and the Future Indicative in the Conclusion. This combination is 
readily explained from the close relationship between the Present Sub- 
junctive and the Future Indicative, both in etymology and in meaning, 
but it was not a favorite form in the classical period : 
Nec, si cupias, licébit, nor if you should desire it, will it be allowed; 
©. Ver. 2, 69, 167. 
578. General Conditions. — Conditional sentences which contain 
General Truths or Repeated Actions usually take the following 
forms: 
1. Any required tense of the Indicative in the condition with the 
Present or Imperfect Indicative in the conclusion : 
Parvi foris sunt arma, nisi est cdnsilium domi, arms are of little value 
abroad unless there is wisdom at home; ©. Off. 1, 22,76. Si quod erat grande 
vas inventum, laeti adferébant, if any large vessel had been found, they gladly 
brought it to him; ©. Ver. 4, 21, 47. 
2. The Present or Perfect Subjunctive, generally in the second person 
used of an indefinite you = one, any one, in the condition, with the Present 
Indicative in the conclusion: 
Memoria minuitur nisi eam exerceds, the memory is impaired if you do 
not (if one does not) exercise it; C. Sen. 7,21. Nilla est exciisatis peccati, 
si amici. causi peccaverls, it is no excuse for a fault, that (if) you may have 
committed it for the sake of a friend; ©. Am. 11, 87. 
Norz 1, —In Livy and late writers the Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunc- 
tive are sometimes used. Solitary examples also occur in Cicero and Caesar: 
Si apud principés haud satis prdsperé esset pignatum, referébantur, if 
among the principes the battle had not been suficiently successful, they were 
led back ; L. 8,8, 11.

Nore 2.— Observe that all the Indicative forms given in this section for 
General Conditions are also used in Particular Conditions. 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES. —CLASS III 
Subjunctive, Imperfect or Pluperfect in Both Clauses 
579. Rule. — The Imperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive in 
Conditional Sentences with si, nisi, ni, sin, assumes the sup- 
posed. case as Contrary to Fact: 
Sapientia ndn expeterétur, si nihil efficeret, wisdom would not be sought 
(as it is) if it accomplished nothing; ©. Fin.1, 13,42. Si optima tenére 
possémus, haud siné consilid egérémus, if we were able to secure the highest 
good, we should not indeed require counsel. Si voluisset, propius Tiberi 
dimicasset, if he had wished, he would have fought nearer the Tiber. Num- 
quam abisset, nisi sibt viam miinivisset, he would never have gone, if he 
had not prepared for himself a way; ©. Tuse. 1, 14, 82. 
1. Here the Imperfect generally relates to Present time and the Pluperfect 
to Past time, as in the examples; but sometimes the Imperfect retains its 
original signification as a past tense of continued action, especially when it 
is accompanied by a word denoting past time : 
Neque tantum laudis Nestori tribuisset Homérus, nisi tum esset honds 
éloquentiae, Homer would not have awarded so great praise to Nestor, if 
there were then no honor for eloquence ; O. Brut. 10, 40. 
DEVIATIONS FROM THE REGULAR FORMS OF CONDITIONAL 
SENTENCES 
580. Certain deviations from the regular form of the conclusion 
are admissible from the following facts: 
1. The conclusion is often an independent clause, especially in the 
first class of conditional sentences, and as such it may take any form 
  
1The Present and Imperfect Subjunctive alike seem to have been capable 
originally of representing a condition either as Possible or as Impossible, but by 
a shifting of tenses which began before the time of Plautus, the Imperfect gradu- 
ally assumed the latter function for present time, thus relinquishing, in con- 
ditional sentences, its original force as a past tense, though traces of this original 
meaning are seen even in the classical period. Moreover, the use of the Present 
Subjunctive in early Latin in conditions contrary to fact is only an illustration of 
its original use.    
-P-A-G-E-315
    
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 299 
admissible in such clauses, as that of a Statement, a Wish, or a 
Command. 
2. Certain equivalent expressions may be substituted for the regular 
Subjunctive. 
581. The Indicative in the Condition may be accompanied by 
the Imperative or Subjunctive in the Conclusion, regarded as an 
Independent Clause : 
Si quid peccivi, igndsce, if I have done anything wrong, pardon me; 
©. Att. 8,15, 4. Quid timeam, si beatus futiirus sum, what should I fear, if 1 
am going to be happy ? Si quid habés certius, velim scire, if you have any 
tidings, I should like to know it; ©. Att. 4, 10. 
1. The Subjunctive in the condition may be accompanied by the Indica- 
tive in the conclusion to emphasize a fact, especially with a condition intro- 
duced by nisi, or ni: 
Certamen aderat, ni Fabius rem expedisset, @ contest was at hand, but 
Fabius (if Fabius had not) adjusted the affair; L.3,1. Nec véni, nisi fata 
locum dedissent, and I should not have come, if the fates had not assigned 
the place; V. 11, 112. 
582. The Indicative of the Periphrastic Conjugations, denoting 
that the action is About to take place or Ought to take place, has 
almost the same meaning as the ordinary Subjunctive forms of 
the same verb. Accordingly periphrastic forms in the conclusion 
of conditional sentences are generally in the Indicative (525, 1): 
Quid, si hostés veniant, factiiri estis, what will you do, if the enemy 
should come? L. 8,52. Si quaeratur, itidicandum est, if inquiry should be 
made, a decision must be given; C. Top. 2, 8%. Relictiiri agrds erant, nisi 
litters misisset, they would have left (were about to leave, but did not) their 
lands, if he had not sent a letter. Si vérum respondére vellés, haec erant 
dicenda,! if you had wished to answer truly, this should have been said. 
1. The close relationship in meaning between the periphrastic forms in 
iirus sum and the ordinary Subjunctive forms is illustrated by the following 
examples: 
Quae Caesar numquam fécisset, ea nunc proferuntur, those things which 
Caesar would never have done are now reported as his ; ©. Att. 14, 13,6. Quae 
  
1 Observe that the Indicative of this Passive Periphrastic Conjugation, this 
should have been said, has precisely the same force as the Subjunctive in such 
sentences as the following: 
Mortem piignans oppetissés, you should have met death in battle; C. Sest. 20, 45. 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  
  3800 SYNTAX 
ille factiirus ndn fuit, ea fiunt, those things which he would not have done 
(was not about to do) are now done ; ©. Att. 14, 14, 2. 
2. When the Perfect or Imperfect of the Periphrastic Indicative in the 
conclusion of a conditional sentence is brought into a construction which 
requires the Subjunctive, the Perfect is generally used irrespective of the 
tense of the principal verb : 
Aded inopia est coadctus ut, nisi timuisset, Galliam repetitiirus fuerit,! he 
was so pressed by want that, if he had not feared, he would have returned to 
Gaul ; L. 22, 82. 
583. The Historical tenses of verbs denoting Ability, as pos- 
sum, and of those denoting Duty, Propriety, Necessity, as débed 
and the like, are often in the Indicative in the conclusion of con- 
ditional sentences, on account of their close relationship in meaning 
to the Subjunctive (525, 1): 
Déléri exercitus potuit, si perseciiti victdrés essent, the army might have 
been destroyed if the victors had pursued; L. 82,12. Quem, si iilla in té pietas 
esset, colere débébas, whom you ought to have honored, if there was any filial 
affection in you ; GO. Ph. 2, 88,99. Quae si dubia essent, tamen omnés bonds rei 
piblicaé subvenire decébat, even if these things were doubtful, still it would 
behoove all good men to aid the republic ; 8. 85, 48. 
1. But these verbs often take the Subjunctive in accordance with the 
general rule, especially in Cicero: 
Quid facere potuissem, nisi tum consul fuissem, what should I have been 
able to accomplish, if I had not then been consul? ©. R. P. 1, 6, 10. 
2. The Perfect Tense in the conclusion of a conditional sentence is regu- 
larly in the Indicative when accompanied by paene or prope (538, 6): 
Pons iter paene hostibus dedit, ni tinus vir fuisset, the bridge would have 
Surnished (almost furnished) a passage to the enemy, had there not been 
one man; L. 2, 10. 
8. The historical tenses of the verb esse with predicate adjectives (as 
aequius, melius, réctius, satius; iiistum, réctum, par, etc.) are gener- 
ally in the Indicative in the conclusion of conditional sentences; see 525, 2: 
Si ita putasset, optabilius Mildni fuit dare iugulum Clodid, if he had so 
thought, it would have been preferable for Milo to offer his neck to Clodius ; 
©. Mil. 11, 81. 
  
1 Here repetitirus fuerit is the Subjunctive of Result; but it is in the Per- | 
fect, because, if it were not dependent, the Perfect Indicative would have been 
used.

CONDITIONAL CLAUSES OF COMPARISON 301 
4. In a few other cases also, a conclusion of one form of the conditional 
sentence is sometimes combined with a condition of a different form ; 
Si tibf umquam sum visus fortis, certé mé in ila causa admiratus essés, if 
Ihave ever seemed to you to be brave, you would certainly have admired me 
in that trial ; ©. Att. 1,16. Id neque, si fatum fuerat, effiigisset, nor would he 
have escaped this if it had been fated; O. Div. 2, 8, 20. 
CONDITIONAL CLAUSES OF COMPARISON 
584. Rule. — Conditional Clauses of Comparison, intro- 
duced by ac si, ut si, quam si, quasi, tamquam, tamquam si, 
velut, velut si, as df, than if, take the Subjunctive : 
Ti similiter facis, ac si mé rogés, you are doing nearly the same thing, as 
if you should ask me; ©.N.D.3,8,8. In eadem sunt iniistitia, ut si in suam 
rem aliéna convertant, they are involved in the same injustice, as if they 
should appropriate another’s possessions to their own use; C. Off. 1, 14, 42. 
Tam té diligit quam si vixerit técum, he loves you as much as if he had 
lived with you; ©. Fam. 16, 5,1. Quasi nihil umquam audierim, as if I had 
never heard anything. Sic iacent, tamquam sine animd sint, they lie as if 
they were without mind. Cridélitatem, velut si adesset, horrébant, they 
shuddered at his cruelty, as if he were present; cf. Caes. 1, 82. 
1. In all these sentences the principal clause is entirely independent of 
the conditional clause. 
2. In the conditional clause the Present or Imperfect is used for Present 
time, and the Perfect or Pluperfect for Past time. 
3. The Present and Perfect may be used in conditions contrary to fact — 
a survival of the ancient usage as seen in Plautus and Terence. 
4. Ceu and sicuti are sometimes used like ac si, ut si, etc.: 
Ceu cétera niisquam bella forent, as if there were nowhere any other battles ; 
Y. 2, 438. Sicuti audiri possent, as if they could be heard ; 8. 60, 4. 
5. Clauses of Comparison, which are not conditional, are treated as Inde- 
pendent clauses. They are generally introduced by such correlatives as 
ita or sic... ut, hus or so... as; tam... quam, so or as... as; talis 
++. qualis, such...as; tantus... quantus, so great... as: 
Ut sementem féceris, ita metés, as you sow, so shall you reap ; C. Or. 2, 65, 261. 
Nihil est tam populare quam bonitas, nothing is so popular as goodness. 
Tam dif requiéscd quam dia ad te seribd, IT am comforted so long as I am 
writing to you; ©. Att.9,4,1. Talem amicum volunt, qualés ipsi esse non 
possunt, they wish their friend to be such as they themselves can not be.

CONDITIONAL ADVERSATIVE CLAUSES 
585. Rule. —Etst and etiam si, when they mean although, 
introduce Adversative clauses and take the Indicative, but 
when they mean even if they introduce Conditional clauses, 
and accordingly take the same construction as si: 
Etsi ab hoste ea dicébantur, tamen non neglegenda existimabant, 
although this was said by the enemy, still they did not think that it should be 
disregarded ; Caes, 5,28, Etiam si multi mécum contendent, tamen omnés 
superabd, although many will enter the contest with me, yet I shall surpass 
them all; C. Fam. 5, 6, 4. 
Stultitia, etsi adepta est quod concupivit, numquam sé satis consectitam 
putat, folly, even if it has obtained what it desired, never thinks that it has 
obtained enough. Etiam si oppetenda mors esset, domi mallem, even if 
death ought to be met, I should prefer to meet it at home; C. Fam. 4, 7, 4. 
  1. An Adversative clause may represent the action as possible rather 
than actual, and thus may take the Potential Subjunctive : 
Etsi nihil habeat in sé gloria, tamen virtiitem sequitur, although glory 
may have nothing in itself, yet it follows virtue ; CO. 'Tuse. 1, 45, Foo. 
2. Clauses with etsi and etiam si form a connecting link between Con- 
ditional clauses on the one hand and Concessive clauses on the other, as they 
partake of the characteristics of both. 
8. For etsi, and yet, introducing an independent clause, see 586, 4. 
MOODS IN ADVERSATIVE AND CONCESSIVE CLAUSES 
586. Rule.—I. Clauses introduced by quamquam and 
tametsi contain admitted facts, and accordingly take the 
Indicative : 2 
Quamquam excellébat abstinentia, tamen exsilid multatus est, although 
he was distinguished for integrity, yet he was punished with exile; N.3,1. 
Quamquam festinas, ndn est mora longa, although you are in haste, the 
delay is not long. ‘Tametsi ab duce déserébantur, tamen spem saliitis in 
virtiite ponébant, although they were deserted by their leader, they still 
placed their hope of safety in their valor ; Caes. 5, 34. 
1. But clauses with quamquam and tametsi‘admit the Potential Sub. 
junctive when the thought requires that mood (569): 
Quamquam alii dicant, although others may say ; ©. Fin. 8, 21, 70.
-P-A-G-E-319
  ADVERSATIVE AND CONCESSIVE CLAUSES 303 
2. In poetry and late prose, quaamquam often takes the Subjunctive, 
regularly in Juvenal and generally in Tacitus : 
Quamquam plerique ad senectam pervenirent, although very many reached 
old age; Tae. A. 8, 55, 
II. Clauses introduced by licet, quamvis, ut, or né are 
Concessive, and accordingly take the Concessive Subjunctive 
(559, 3). 
Licet irrideat, pliis apud mé tamen ratio valébit, although he may deride, 
yet reason will avail more with me; C. Parad. 1,1,8. Non ti possis, quamyvis 
excellas, you would not be able, although you may be eminent. Ut désint 
virés, tamen est laudanda voluntas, although the strength may fail (let 
strength fail), still the will is to be commended. Né sit summum malum 
dolor, malum certé est, though pain may not be the greatest evil, it is cer- 
tainly an evil ; ©. Tuse. 2, 5, 14. 
1. The Subjunctive after licet and quamvis is the Concessive Subjunc- 
tive. It was originally independent of these particles. Thus, licet, irrideat, 
it is allowed, let him deride ; quamvis excellas, be as eminent as you wish 
(quam-vis = quam, as, and vis, you wish). 
2. Quamvis takes the Subjunctive in the best prose ; generally also in 
Nepos and Livy, but in the poets and late writers it often admits the In- 
dicative : 
Erat dignitate régia, quamvis carébat nomine, he was of royal dignity, 
though he was without the name; N.1,2,3. Polis amat nostram, quamvis 
est riistica, Misam, Pollio loves my muse, although it is rustic ; V. B. 8, 84. 
3. The Subjunctive with ut and né in concessive clauses is practically an 
independent Concessive Subjunctive. Thus, né sit... dolor, let not pain 
be the greatest evil (grant that it is not), an entirely independent clause ; 
sO, too, ut désint virés, let strength fail, or grant that strength fails, also 
an independent clause which has assumed ut as the afficm ative to corre- 
spond to né in the negative clause. 
4. Quamquam and etsi, meaning yet, but yet, and yet, often introduce 
independent clauses : 
Quamquam quid loquor, and yet why do I speak ? Etsi consilium réctum 
esse scid, and yet I know that the plan is right. 
5. Ut...sic, or ut... ita, though... yet (as... so), involving com- 
parison, rather than concession, does not require the Subjunctive : 
Ut & proeliis quiétem habuerant, ita non cessaverant ab opere, though 
(as) they had had rest from battles, yet (so) they had not ceased from work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
    304 SYNTAX 
6. Quamvis, meaning as you wish, as much as you wish, however much, 
may accompany licet with the Subjunctive : 
Quamvis énumerés multds licet, though you may count up as many as you 
wish ; C. Leg. 8, 10, 24, “ 
MOODS WITH Dum, Modo, Dummodo 
587. Rule. — The Jussive Subjunctive is used with dum, 
modo, modo ut, and dummodo, meaning if only, provided, in 
conditional clauses of desire : 
Dum rés maneant, verba fingant, let them manufacture words, if only the 
facts remain. Manent ingenia, modo permaneat industria, mental powers 
remain if only industry continues; C. Sen. 7; 22. Modo ut haee nobis loca 
tenére liceat, if only it is permitted us to occupy these places. Dum né tibi 
videar, non laboro, provided I do not seem so to you, I do not care; C. Att. 
8, 11,B.8. Dummodo né continuum sit, provided this be not continuous. 
MOODS WITH Quod, Quia, Quoniam, Quands6! 
588. Rule. —Causal Clauses with quod, quia, quoniam, 
quand6, generally take 
I. The Indicative to assign a reason positively, on one’s 
own authority: 
Délectatus sum tuis litteris, quod té intelléxi iam posse ridére, I have 
been delighted with your letter, because I have learned from it that now you 
can laugh ; ©. Fam. 9, 20,1. Quia natiira miitari non potest, because nature 
can not be changed. Quoniam supplicatio décréta est, celebratote illds 
diés, since a thanksgiving has been decreed, celebrate those days. Quando 
pauperiem horrés, since you shudder at poverty} M1. 8. 2, 5,9. 
  II. The Subjunctive to assign a reason doubtfully, or on 
another’s authority ?: 
Aristidés nonne expulsus est patria, quod itistus esseti, roas not Aristides 
banished because (on the alleged ground that) he was just? 0. Tuse. 5, 86, 105. 
  1 Quod and quia are in origin relative pronouns. Quoniam = quom iam, 
when now. 
2 Observe that causal clauses with the Indicative state a fact, and at the same 
time present that fact as a reason or cause, but that causal clauses with the Sub- 
junctive simply assign a reason. Thus quod itistus esset does not state that 
Aristides was just, but simply indicates the alleged ground of his banishment.

MOODS IN CAUSAL CLAUSES 805 
Reprehendis mé, quia défendam, you reprove me because (on the ground 
that) I defend him. Quoniam civitati cdnsulere non possent, since they 
could not consult for the state. 
1. Sometimes by a special construction the Subjunctive of a verb of 
Saying or Thinking is used, while the verb which introduces a reason or 
a statement on another’s authority is put in the Infinitive; see 649, I: 
Diés prérogatur, quod tabulas obsignatas diceret (= obsignatae essent), 
the time is extended on the ground that the documents were signed, as he said ; 
C. Ver. 1, 88,98. Légatis acciisiintibus, quod peciinias cépisse arguerent, as the 
ambassadors accused him on the ground that he had received moneys, as they 
claimed ; ©. Fin, 17, 24. 
2. N6n quod, nén qué, nén quin, nédn quia, also quam quod, etc., 
are used with the Subjunctive to denote an alleged reason, in distinction 
from the true reason : 
Non quod suscénsérem, sed quod suppudébat, not because I was angry, 
but because I was ashamed; ©. Fam.9, 1,2. N6n qué habérem quod scribe- 
rem, not because (that) I had anything to write; OC, Att.7, 15,1. Non quin 
réctum esset, sed quia, etc., not because it was not right, but because, etc. 
Norge. — In such clauses the Indicative is sometimes used to call attention 
to the facts in the case: 
Non quod multis débeG, sed quia, etc., not because I am indebted to many 
(as I really am), but because, ete.; C. Plane. 82, 78. 
3. The quod clause was originally a substantive clause used as Ap- 
positive, Subject, or Object : 
Hoc praestamus feris quod colloquimur inter nds, we are superior to the 
brutes in this that we converse together; ©. Or. 1, 8, 82. Praetered quod 
hane sibi domum délégit, I pass over the fact that she chose for herself this 
home. Hite accédébat quod exercitum lixuridsé habuerat, to this was added 
the fact that he had kept the army in luxury ; 8. C. 11, 5. 
Nore. — Clauses with quod sometimes stand at the beginning of sentences 
to announce the subject of discourse : 
Quod mé Agamemnonem aemulari putas, falleris, as to the fact that you 
think that I emulate Agamemnon, you are in error ; N. 15, 5, 6. 
4. From the Substantive clause was developed the Causal clause, as 
follows : 
Propter hane causam quod mé adiiivérunt, for this reason, that they 
aided me, or beeause they aided me; ©. Ver. 3, 46,199. Dolébam quod socium 
laboris Amiseram, I was grieving over the fact that I had lost the companion 
HARK, LAT, GRAM.— 21
-P-A-G-E-322
    306 SYNTAX 
of my labor, or because I had lost the companion of my labor. Tibi agd 
gratids quod mé molestia liberasti, J thank you because you have freed me 
from annoyance ; C. Fam, 13, 62. 
Nore. — Observe that in the first example the quod clause may be either 
an Appositive to causam or a Causal clause, that in the second it may be 
either the Direct object of dolébam or a Causal clause, i.e. in these exam- 
ples we see the Causal clause in the actual process of development, while in 
the third example we have a fully developed Causal clause. In the time of 
Plautus the Causal meaning of quod was just beginning to make its appear- 
ance, while that of quia was already fully developed. 
5. Quia had the same development as quod : 
Doled quia dolés, I grieve over the fact that you grieve, or because you grieve. 
6. Quoniam and quandé6 were originally temporal particles meaning 
when now, when, and are so used in Plautus, but the causal meaning was 
early developed in both. 
INDICATIVE AND SUBJUNCTIVE IN RELATIVE CLAUSES 
589. Rule. —Clanses introduced by the relative qui, or 
by Relative Adverbs, ubi, unde, qué, etc., take 
I. The Indicative, when they simply state or assume facts, with- 
out any accessory notion of Purpose, Result, Concession, or Cause : 
Ego qui t@ confirmd, ipse mé non possum, J who encourage you am 
not able to encourage myself; C. Fam. 14, 4, 5. Civitatés propinquae his 
locis, ubi bellum ge: t, states near to those places where he had been 
carrying on war. Athéniénsés, unde légés ortae putantur, the Athenians, 
from whom laws are supposed to have been derived. Cimis, quo sé contu- 
lerat, at Cumae, to which he had betaken himself:    
  Nore. —So especially with General Relatives : 
Quisquis est, is est sapiéns, whoever he is, he is wise. 
II. The Subjunctive in all other cases: 
  Missi sunt délécti, qui Thermopylas occuparent, picked men were sent 
to take possession (that they might take possession) ef Thermopylae ; 
N.2,3,1. Domum, ubi habitaret, rat, he had selected a house where he 
might dwell (that he might dwell in it); C. Ph. 2, 25,62, Quae tam firma 
civitas est, quae ndn odiis possit éverti, what state is so firmly established 
that it cannot be ruined by dissensions?   
-P-A-G-E-323
  MOODS IN RELATIVE CLAUSES 307 
590. The Volitive Subjunctive is used in Relative clauses, to 
denote Purpose, as in ut clauses (568) : 
Certumst (certum est) hominem conloqui, qui possim vidéri huic fortis, 4 
mé ut abstineat manum, J am determined to address the man face to face, 
that I may appear to him brave, that he may keep his hands off from me; PI. 
Amph. 339. Légatds Roémam, qui auxilium peterent, misére, they sent am- 
bassadors to Rome to ask aid (that they might ask aid). Locum petit, 
unde hostem invadat, he seeks a position from which he may (that from it he 
may) attack the enemy ; L. 4, 27, 8. 
1. In the first example, observe that the Relative clause, qui possim 
fortis, and the ut clause, are equivalent expressions of Purpose. In the 
Independent form, they would read: possim vidéri huic fortis, let me be 
able to appear to him brave; 4 mé abstineat manum, let him keep his 
hands off from me. 
  591. The Potential Subjunctive is used in Relative clauses: 
1. To characterize Indefinite or General antecedents, especially Gen- 
eral Negatives: 
Ném est Srator qui Démostheni sé similem ndlit esse, there is no orator 
who would be unwilling to be like Demosthenes ; ©. Opt. @ Quis est qui 
hoc dicere audeat, who is there who would dare to say this ?    
Nore 1. — Observe that, in these relative clauses, the Subjunctive is purely 
Potential, and that it has precisely the same force as in the following inde- 
pendent sentence: 
Quis hoc dicere audeat, who would dare to say this ? 
Nors 2.—The Indicative is freely used in relative clauses after indefi- 
nite antecedents, in poetry, especially in Plautus and Terence, and in late 
prose. Even in the best writers it is often used when the Fact is to be made 
prominent: 
Sunt quis iuvat, there are those whom it delights; H.1, 1,3. Permulta sunt, 
quae dici possunt, there are many things which may be said; C. Rose. A. 83, 94. 
2. To denote the Natural Result of an Action or Quality: 
Non is sum qui his délecter, J am not one who would be delighted with 
these things, or such a one as to be delighted; ©. Harus 9,18. Non tii is es 
quem nihil délectet, you are not one whom nothing would please. Neque 
quisquam fuit, ubi nostrum itis obtinérémus, there was no one with whom 
(where) we could obtain our right ; C. Quinct. 9, 84. 
3. In Restrictive clauses, as quod sciam, as far as I (may) know; 
quod meminerim, as far as I can remember; qués ego audierim, at 
least such as I have (may have) heard, ete.:
-P-A-G-E-324

Non ego té, quod sciam, umquam ante hunc diem vidi, as far as I know, 
Thave never seen you before this day; Pl. Men. 500. Omnium, quis ego audi- 
erim, of all whom I may have heard; ©. Br. 55, 203. 
4. In clauses with quod, or with a relative particle, cir, quaré, etc., in 
certain idiomatic expressions. ‘Thus, after est, there is reason; n6n est, 
nihil est, there is no reason; nilla causa est, there is no reason; nén 
habe6, nihil habed, I have no reason; quid est, what reason is there? ete.: 
Est quod gaudeas, thee ts reason why you should rejoice (there is that 
as to which yon may rejoice); Pl. Trin.310. Nihil habed, quod acciisem 
senectiitem, 2 have m reason to complain of old age; ©.S8en.5, 13. Tibi 
causa niilla est-ciir velis,) you have no reason why you should wish. 
5. After tinus, sélus, and the like: 
Sapientia est ina quae maestitiam pellat, wisdom is the only thing which 
dispels (may dispel) sadness; ©. Fin. 1, 13,43, Sdli centum erant qui creari 
patrés possent, there were only one hundred who could be made senators.   6. After Comparatives with quam: 
Damna maidra sunt quam quae (ut ea) aestimari possint, the losses are too 
great to be estimated (greater than so that they can be estimated); L. 3, 72. 
Nore. — For the Infinitive after comparatives with quam, sce 643, 2. 
7. After dignus, indignus, idéneus, and aptus: 
Hune Caesar iddneum ifidicéverat quem mitteret, Caesar had judged him 
a suitable person to send (whom he might send); Caes. C.3, 10,2. Fabulae 
dignae quae legantur, plays worth reading (which may or should be read). 
Nore. — For the Infinitive with these words, see 608, 4, and note 1. 
592. The Subjunctive, originally Potential, is used in Relative 
clauses to denote Cause or Reason: 
O vis veritatis, quae sé défendat, O the power of truth, that it (which) can 
defend itself ; C. Am. 26, 63. O fortiinate aduléscéns, qui tuae virtitis Homé- 
rum praecdnem invéneris, O fortunate youth, in having obtained (who may 
have obtained) Homer as the herald of your valor ; ©. Arch. 10, 24. Nec facillimé 
Agnoscitur, quippe qui blandiatur, he is not very easily detected, as he is likely 
to flatter.. Maritimae rés, ut quae celerem métum habérent, maritime affairs, 
as they involve prompt movement (as things which would have, ete.). Non | 
procul aberat, utpote qui sequerétur, he was not far away, as he was pur- 
suing (as one who might be pursuing); 8. ©. 57, 4. 
  
1Observe that the mood in cir velis would be precisely the same in an 
independent sentence. It is Potential, not Deliberative.
-P-A-G-E-325
MOODS IN CLAUSES WITH QUIN 309 
1. Quippe, ut, and utpote sometimes accompany the relative in Causal 
clauses, as in the last three examples. ‘They emphasize the causal relation. 
2. In Plautus and Terence, causal clauses with qui and quippe qui admit 
either the Indicative or the Subjunctive. The latter mood emphasizes the 
causal relation and is used especially with ut qui: 
Quem rogem, qui hic néminem alium videam, whom am I to ask, since I 
can see no other one here? Ut qui mé tibf esse cdnservom velint, since they 
(as those who) would wish me to be your fellow-servant ; Pl. Capt. 243. 
3. Causal clauses with qui admit the Indicative in all writers, when the 
statement is viewed as a fact rather than as a cause: 
Habed senectiiti gratiam, quae mihi sermonis aviditatem auxit, I cherish 
gratitude to old age, which has increased my love of conversation ; C. Sen. 14, 46. 
4, In Sallust quippe qui regularly takes the Indicative : 
Quippe qui régnum animé iam invaserat, since in thought he had already 
seized the kingdom ; 8. 20, 6. 
593. The Subjunctive, originally Jussive, is used 
1. In those Relative clauses which are equivalent to Conditional 
clauses with the Subjunctive (578): 
Haec qui (= si quis) videat, ndnne cdgatur cdnfitéri, etc., if any one should 
see these things, would he not be compelled to admit, etc.? C.N.D. 2,4, 12. Qui 
vidéret, urbem captam diceret, if any one saw it, he would say that the city 
was taken ; ©. Ver. 4, 28, 52. 
2. In those Relative clauses which are equivalent to Concessive 
clauses with the Subjunctive (586, IT.): 
Absolvite eum, qui sé fatedtur peciinias cépisse, acquit him, although he 
confesses (let him confess) that he has accepted money ; ©. Ver. 3, 95,221, Ego- 
met qui leviter Graecis litteras attigissem, tamen complirés diés Athénis 
sum commoratus, alihough I had pursued Greek studies only superficially, 
yet ITremained in Athens several days ; ef. C. Or. 1, 18, 82. 
MOODS WITH Quin 
594. Rule.—I. Quin in direct questions and commands 
takes the ordinary construction of independent sentences: 
Quin cdnscendimus equis, why do we not mount our horses? WL. 1, St, % 
Quin tacés, why are you not silent? Quin tnd verbo dic, nay, say in a 
single word; T. And. 45, 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
310 SYNTAX 
  II. Quin in subordinate clauses takes the Subjunctive: 
Nee dubitiri débet, quin fuerint ante Homérum poétae, nor ought it ta 
be doubted that there were poets before Homer ; ©. Brut. 18,71. Neque reciisare, 
quin armis contendant, and that they do not refuse to contend in arms. 
Némé est tam fortis, quin rei novitate perturbétur, no one is so brave, as 
not to be disturbed by the suddenness of the event ; Caes. 6, 39, 8. 
1. In number I., observe that the use of quin in commands is developed 
from its use in questions. Thus, quin tacés, why are you not silent ? implies 
a reproof which readily passes into a Command, as quin tacé, nay, be silent. 
2. In number II, the quin clause in the first example is developed from 
the interrogative quin = qui-ne, meaning why not? Quin... poétae, why 
may there not have been poets before Homer? The mood is Potential. In 
the next example, quin is used in the sense of qu6 minus and thus intro- 
duces a clause of Purpose ; see 568. In the last example, quin is equivalent 
to qui nGn and introduces a clause of Characteristic and accordingly takes 
the Potential Subjunctive. 
595. Quin is used after Negatives and Interrogatives implying 
a Negative. Thus: 
1. After negative expressions implying Doubt, Uncertainty, Distance, 
Omission, and the like, as nén dubitd, ndn dubium est, nihil abest, 
nihil or n6n praetermitt6, etc.: 
Non dubitat quin sit Tria peritiira, he does not doubt that Troy will fall; 
C. Sen. 10,31. N6n erat dubium, quin plirimum possent, there was no doubt 
that they had very great power; Caes. 1,8. Nihil abest quin sim miserrimus, 
nothing is wanting to make me (that I should be) most unhappy. Nillum 
intermisi diem, quin aliquid ad té litterarum darem, I have allowed no day to 
pass without sending (but that I sent) a letter to you. 
2. After verbs of Hindering, Preventing, Refusing, and the like, to 
denote Purpose, like qué minus and né after the same verbs: 
Quin loquar haec, numquam mé potest déterrére, you can never deter me 
from saying this; Pl. Amph. 559. Retinéri non potuerant quin téla cdicerent, 
they could not be restrained from hurling their weapons ; Caes. 1, 47, 2. 
8. After facere nén possum, fieri nén potest, etc., in Object and 
Subject clauses : 
  
1 Quin in subordinate clauses seems to represent two separate words: an inter- 
rogative quin = qui-ne, why not, from which was developed a negative relative, 
meaning by which not = qudminus; anda relative quin = qui n6n, quae non, 
quod non, who not. 
   
-P-A-G-E-327
MOODS IN CLAUSES WITH CUM 311 
Facere non possum, quin cottidié litteras ad té mittam, I cannot but send 
(cannot help sending) a letter to you daily ; cf. C. Att. 12,27. Effici ndn potest 
quin eds dderim, it cannot be brought about that I should not hate them. 
4. After ném6, nillus, nihil, quis, and the like, in the sense of qui 
non, quae n6n, ut non: 
Némé est, quin miilit, there is no one who would not prefer ; cf. C. Fam. 6, 1, 1. 
Ném6 est quin audierit, there is no one who has not heard. Nila fuit civitas 
quin Caesari paréret, there was no state which was not subject to Caesar. Quis 
est quin cernat, who is there who does not (would not) perceive? C. Acad. 2, 7, 20. 
5. After various verbs with numquam and in Interrogative clauses 
with umquam : 
Numquam tam male est Siculis, quin aliquid facété dicant, it ts never so 
bad with the Sicilians that they cannot say something witty ; ©. Ver. 4, 43, 95. 
Quis umquam templum illud adspexit quin avaritiae tuae testis esset, who 
ever looked upon that temple without being a witness of your avarice ? 
6. A pronoun, is or id, referring to the subject of the principal clause, 
{fs sometimes expressed after quin : 
Quis vénit quin is dé avaritié tua commonérétur, who came without being 
reminded (but that he was reminded) of your avarice ? ©. Ver. 1, 59, 154. 
596. Special Verbs. — Certain verbs which take quin with more 
or less frequency also admit other constructions. Thus: 
1. N6n dubits admits either a quin clause or a dependent question: 
Nolite dubitare, quin huic crédatis omnia, do not hesitate to intrust every- 
thing to him; C. Man. 23, 68. Non dubitd quid nobis agendum putés, J do not 
doubt what you think we ought to do; ©. Att. 10, 1, 2. 
2. A few verbs of Hindering and Opposing, especially déterred and 
impedi6, take the Subjunctive with né, quin, or qué minus: 
Hos multitiidinem déterrére né frimentum conferant, that these deter the 
multitude from bringing the grain together ; Caes. 1, 17,2. Quin loquar haec, 
numquam mé potés déterrére, you can never deter me from saying this. Non 
déterret sapientem mors quo minus rei piiblicae consulat, death does not deter 
a wise man from deliberating for the republic ; ©. Tuse. 1, 88, 91. 
CLAUSES WITH Cum 
597. The particle cum, like the relative from which it is 
derived, is very extensively used in subordinate constructions, 
as in Causal, Concessive, and Temporal clauses.
-P-A-G-E-328
  312 SYNTAX 
SUBJUNCTIVE WITH Cum IN CAUSAL AND CONCESSIVE 
CLAUSES 
598. Rule. —In writers of the best period, Causal and 
Concessive clauses with cum take the Subjunctive : 
Cum vita sine amicis metiis pléna sit, ratio monet amicitias comparare, 
since life without friends is (would be) full of fear, reason ad: 
establish friendships ; C. Vin. 1, 20, 66. Quae cum ita sint, perge, since these 
things are so, proceed. Quippe cum eds diligamius, since in truth we love 
them; ©. Am. 8,28. Utpote cum sine febri labdrassem, since indeed I had 
been without fever in my illness. Cum praesertim vos alium miseritis, 
especially since you have sent another ; C. Man. 5, 12. 
Phocidn fuit pauper, cum divitissimus esse posset, Phocion was a poor 
man, although he might have been very rich; of. N. 19,1, 2 Soer cum 
facile posset édiici @ ciist6dia, ndluit, Socrates, though he could easily have 
escaped from prison, was unwilling to do so ef. 0. Tus. 1, 29, 71. Cum multa 
sint in philosophia utilia, although there are many useful things in philosophy. Ss us to 
      te      
  1. Observe that the causal relation is emphasized by the addition of 
quippe and utpote to cum, precisely as it is by the addition of these 
particles to qui; see 592, 1. Praesertim added to cum, as in the fifth 
example, has a similar force. 
599. Indicative in Causal and Concessive Clauses with Cum. — The 
Indicative in Causal clauses with cum is the regular construction 
in Plautus and Terence; and it is used in all writers when the 
statement is viewed as an actual fact, especially after laudo, 
gauded, gratulor, and the like: 
Quom optumé fécisti, since you have done excellently ; Pi. Capt. 428, Quom 
hdc ndn possum, since I have not this power. Cum dé tuis factis conque- 
runtur, since they complain of your deeds; ©. Ver. 2, 64,155. Gratulor tib¥, cum 
tantum valés, I congratulate you on the fact that you have so great influence. 
1. Concessive clauses with cum sometimes take the Indicative to em- 
phasize the fact rather than the concession + 
Cum tabulas emunt, tamen divitiaés suas vincere nequeunt, though they 
purchase paintings, they are yet unable to exhaust their wealth; 8. C. 20, 12. 
2. Ut... sic and ut... ita, though... yet (as... 80), involving 
Comparison, rather than Concession, generally take the Indicative: 
Ut 4 proeliis quiétem habuerant, ita ndn cessiverant ab opere, though 
(as) they had had rest from battles, yet (so) they had not ceased from work.
-P-A-G-E-329
  
MOODS IN CLAUSES WITH CUM 313 
MOODS IN TEMPORAL CLAUSES WITH Cum 
600. Rule. —Temporal clauses with cum, meaning when, 
while, after, take 
I. The Indicative in the Present, Perfect, and Future Tenses: 
Libros, cum est dtium, legere soled, I am wont to read books when T have 
leisure; ©. Or. 2, 14,59. Tum cum urbem condidit, at the time when he 
founded the city. Cum Caesar in Galliam vénit, when Caesar came into 
Gaul. Cum hominés cupiditatibus imperabunt, when men shall govern 
their desires. 
1. Cum Inversum. — Here belong clauses with cum inversum, i.e. with 
cum in the sense of et tum, and then. This is an inverted construction 
by which the leading thought is put in the Temporal clause which generally 
takes the Historical Present or Perfect, often with repente, subitG, or some 
similar word, while the Principal clause generally takes the Imperfect or 
Pluperfect with vix, n6Gndum, iam, etc. : 
Vix ille hdc dixerat, cum iste proniintiat, ete., scarcely had he said this 
when (and then) that man proclaimed, ete.; C. Ver 2, 38,93. Diés ndndum 
decem intercesserant, cum alter filius necatur, ten days had not yet inter- 
vened when (and ther) the other son was put to death. 
II. The Subjunctive in the Imperfect and Pluperfect Tenses : 
Zéndnem, cum Athénis essem, audiébam frequenter, I often heard 
Zeno when I was at Athens; ©.N.D.1,21,59. Cum dimicaret, occisus est, 
when he engaged in battle, he was slain; N.21,3,2. Fuisti saepe, cum 
Athénis essés, in scholis philosophdrum, you were often in the schools of 
the philosophers, when you were at Athens. Caesari cum id nintiatum esset, 
inatirat ab urbe proficisci, when this had been announced to Caesar, he has- 
tened to set out from the city. Cum tridui viam processisset, niintiatum est 
ei, etc., when he had gone a three days’ journey, it was announced to him, ete.   
1. It will be found on an examination of these and similar examples that 
temporal clauses introduced by cum with the Imperfect and Pluperfect 
Subjunctive name, or describe, the occasion on which the action of the 
principal verb is performed. ‘Thus presence in Athens was the essential 
condition on which alone one could hear Zeno, and in the fourth example the 
announcement made to Caesar was the actual cause of his hasty departure 
from the city. These clauses therefore sustain a close relationship to causal 
clauses with cum, and probably take the Subjunctive after the analogy of 
those clauses. ‘They are used chiefly in historical narration, in which the 
causal relation of eyents is often manifest.
-P-A-G-E-330
314 SYNTAX 
2. The Subjunctive of the second person singular, used of an indefinite 
you, meaning any one, may be used in any tense: 
Difficile est tacére, cum doleds, it is difficult to be quiet when you are 
suffering ; C. Sull.10,31- Cum qudsdam audirés, when you heard certain per- 
sons; C. Brut. 35, 184. 
601. Indicative.— The Indicative in the Imperfect and Plu- 
perfect in Temporal clauses with cum is the regular construction 
in Plautus and Texence, but it is exceedingly rare’ in the classical 
period. It is used, however, in temporal clauses, which logically 
are nearly or quite independent of the principal clause. Thus 
1. After cum = et tum, as often in cum interim, cum intered, when 
in the meantime = and or but in the meantime; cum etiam tum, and even 
then; cum n6ndum, hauddum, and not yet: 
Caedébatur virgis, cum interea nillus gemitus audiébatur, he was beaten 
with rods, but in the meantime no groan was heard; C. Ver. 5, 62, 162. Mul- 
tum diéi prdcesserat, cum etiam tum éventus in incerté erat, a large part of 
the day had passed, and even then the result was uncertain. 
2. After such correlative expressions as tum... cum, then... when; 
26 or ill6 tempore or dié... cum, on that time or day... when, and 
kindred expressions : 
   Senatus tum, cum fldrébat imperium, décrévit, the senate decreed at that 
time when its power was at its height; ©. Div.1, 41,92. Ed tempore paruit, 
cum piirére necesse erat, he obeyed at that time when it was necessary to 
obey. 
Nore. — So in the dating of letters: 
Cum haec scribébam, spérabam,? when I wrote this, I hoped; ©. Fam. 8, 18. 
3. After cum, meaning from the time when, since, during which, in such 
expressions as the following: 
Nondum centum et decem anni sunt cum lata est léx, it is not yet a hundred 
and ten years since the law was proposed ; C. Off. 2, 21,75. Permulti anni iam 
erant, cum nilla certamina fuerant, it was already many years during which 
there had been no contests. 
  
1 Caesar, Dé Belld Gallicd, has upwards of two hundred instances of the Im- 
perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive in clauses with cum, and only one Imperfect 
Indicative and eight Pluperfects, the latter of which are all explained by 601, 2 
and 4. Nepos also has upwards of two hundred Subjunctives in these clauses, but 
only one Imperfect Indicative and two Pluperfects. 
2 Remember that the tense is here adapted to the time of the reader, while to 
the writer the time is present. 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
TEMPORAL CLAUSES 315 
4. More commonly after cum, meaning as often as, whenever, in clauses 
denoting Repeated Action or General Truth, though the Subjunctive is 
often used : 
Haec renovabam, cum licébat, I was wont to renew my acquaintance with 
these subjects whenever an opportunity offered ; ©. Acad. P. 1,3, 11. Cum rosam 
viderat, tunc incipere vér arbitrabatur, whenever he saw (had seen) a rose, 
he thought that spring was beginning ; ©. Ver. 5, 10, 27. Erat, cum dé itre 
civili disputarétur, argiimentorum copia, whenever the discussion was about 
the civil law, there was an abundance of arguments. 
Nore. — Memini cum, 7 remember when, generally takes the Indicative ; 
audi6 cum, vide6 cum, and animadvert6 cum generally the Subjunctive :    
Memini, cum mibi désipere vidébare, Z remember when you seemed to me 
to be unwise ; C. Fam. 7, 28,1. Soled audire Roscium, cum dicat, J am accus- 
tomed to hear Roscius say (when he says); C. Or. 1, 28, 129, Ego ex iis saepe 
audivi, cum dicerent, etc., I have often heard them say (from them when they 
said); C. Or. 2, 87, 155.

602. Rule. — Temporal Clauses, introduced by the parti- 
cles, postquam, posted quam, after, — pridié quam, postridié 
quam, on the day before, on the day after; ubi, ut, simul, 
simul atque, when, as, as soon as,—state facts, and accord- 
ingly take the Indicative, generally the Perfect, or the 
Historical Present : 
Postquam omnés Belgarum copias ad sé venire vidit, castra posuit, 
after he saw that all the forces of the Belgae were coming against him, he 
pitched his camp; Caes.2,5,4. Pridié quam tii coactus es cdnfiteri, ete., 
on the day before you were compelled to admit, etc.; C. Ver. 5, 30,77. Ubidé 
Gius adventii certidrés facti sunt, when they were informed of his approach. 
id ut audivit, as soon as he heard this. Simul in aridd constitérunt, as 
soon as they stood on dry land. Postquam vident, after they saw. 
  1. The Pluperfect is used to denote the result of a Completed action, 
and to mark the interval between two events: 
Posted quam bis cdnsul fuerat, after he had been twice consul ; C. Div. C. 21, 
69. Annis sex postquam voverat, six years after he had made the vow; 
L. 42, 10. 
2. The Pluperfect is also used to denote Repeated or Customary 
action :

316 SYNTAX 
Ut quisque vénerat, haec visere solébat, every one, as he came, was wont 
to visit these objects ; 0. Ver. 4, 3, 5. 
Nore 1.—Other tenses of the Indicative are comparatively rare, though _ 
the Present and Imperfect are sometimes used to denote Incomplete action : 
Postquam aurum habés, now that you have the gold; Pi. True. 919. Post- 
quam nox aderat, when night was approaching ; 8. 58, 7. 
Nore 2.—In a few passages, the Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive 
are found after postquam and posted quam: 
Postea quam simptudsa fieri finera coepissent, Soldnis lége sublita sunt, 
after funerals had begun to be expensive, they were abolished by Solon’s law ; 
©. Leg. 2, 25, 64. 
3. In Livy and the late historians, the Imperfect and Pluperfect Sub- 
junctive are often used in temporal clauses to denote Repeated acticn 
and General truth, and sometimes even in earlier writers : 
  Id ubi dixisset, hastam mittébat, when he had said this, he was wont to 
hurl a spear ; L.1, 82,18. Ut quisque veniret, as each one arrived; L. 2 
  4. In any temporal clause, the Subjunctive may be used in the second 
person singular to denote an indefinite subject, you, one, any one: 
Ubi periclum facias, when you make the trial; Pl. Bac. 63. Ubi revénissés 
domum, when you (any one) had returned home. Priusquam incipias, cén- 
sultd opus est, before you begin, there is need of deliberation; 8. 0.1, 6. 
TEMPORAL CLAUSES WITH Dum, Dénec, AND Quoad 
603. Rule. —I. Temporal clauses with dum, dénec, and 
quoad, meaning as long as, take the Indicative : 
Hoe féci, dum licuit, J did this as long as it was allowed ; ©. Ph. 8, 18, 33. 
Haec civitas, dum erit, laetabitur, this state will rejoice as long as it shall 
exist. Donec eris sdspes, as long as you shall be prosperous. Quoad potuit, 
restitit, he resisted as long as he could ; Caes. 4, 12, 6.

the action is viewed as an actual fact: 
Délibera hoc, dum ego reded, consider this until I return; T. Ad. 196. 
Donec perfécerd hoc, until I shall have accomplished this. Quoad reniintia- 
tum est, until it was actually announced ; N. 15, 9, 3.
-P-A-G-E-333
PSer  ae ee e eeE e e aee 
TEMPORAL CLAUSES 317 
2. The Subjunctive, Present or Imperfect, when the action is 
viewed as something desired, proposed, or conceived: 
Differant, dum défervéscat ira, let them defer it until their anger cools, 
or shall cool; ©. Tuse. 4, 36,78. Exspectas dum dicat, you are waiting until 
he speaks (i.e. that he may speak). Donee consilid patrés firmaret, until 
he strengthened the senators by his counsel. Ea continébis quoad té videam, 
you will keep them until I see you; ©. Att. 18, 21, 4. 
604. Special Constructions of dum and donec. — Note the following: 
1. Dum, meaning while, as distinguished from as long as, generally 
takes the Historical Present Indicative (533, 4), but in the poets and in 
the historians it sometimes takes the Imperfect Subjunctive : 
Dum ea geruntur, Caesari nintiatum est, while those things were taking 
place, it was announced to Caesar. Dum ea gererentur, bellum concitur, 
while those things were taking place, war was begun ; L. 10, 18. 
2. Dénec belongs chiefly. to poetry and late prose. It is not found 
in Caesar or Sallust, and only four times in Cicero. In Livy dénec, 
meaning while, is found with the Imperfect Subjunctive of a repeated 
action, and with the meaning until it is found with the Pluperfect Sub- 
junctive. In Tacitus, when it means until, it generally takes the 
Subjunctive, whatever the tense: 
Nihil trepidibant, ddnec continenti velut ponte agerentur, they did not 
fear at all while they were driven on a continuous bridge, as it were ; L. 21,28. 
Rhénus servat violentiam cursiis, dénec Oceand misceatur, the Rhine pre- 
serves the rapidity of its current until it mingles with the ocean; Tac. A. 2, 6, 3. 
TEMPORAL CLAUSES WITH Antequam AND Priusquam 
605. Rule. —I. In Temporal clauses with antequam and 
priusquam the Present and Perfect are put in the Indicative 
when the action is viewed as an Actual Fact, and in the 
Subjunctive when the action is viewed as something De- 
sired, Proposed, or Conceived : 
Antequam ad sententiam reded, dé mé pauca dicam, before I resume 
asking your opinions, I shall say a few words in regard to myself; 0.C. 4, 10,20. 
Nec prius respexi quam vénimus, nor did I look back until we arrived. 
Priusquam incipias, cdnsultd opus est, before you begin, there is need of 
deliberation; 8.0.1, 6. Non prius ducés dimittunt, quam sit concessum, 
ete., they did not let the leaders go, until it was granted, etc. ; Caes. 3, 18, 7.  
-P-A-G-E-334
  318 SYNTAX 
II. The Imperfect and Pluperfect are put in the Sub- 
junctive :! 
Pervénit, priusquam Pompéius sentire posset, he arrived before Pompey 
could become aware of his approach; Caes. C.8, 67,4. Paucis ante diébus 
quam Syraciisae caperentur, a few days before Syracuse was taken; L. 2%, 
31,12. Antequam d@ med adventii audire potuissent, in Macedoniam 
porréxi, before they were able (had been able) to hear of my approach, I 
went straight into Macedonia; ©. Plane. 41, 98.   
1. When the Principal clause is negative, and contains an historical 
tense, the Temporal clause generally takes the Perfect Indicative, as in the 
second example under the rule, rarely the Imperfect, Indicative or Sub- 
junctive: 
Nec, antequam virés deerant, expiignati sunt, nor were they captured until 
their strength failed; L. 23, 30,4. Non prius égressus est quam réx eum in 
fidem reciperet, he did not withdraw until the king took him under his pro- 
tection ; N. 2, 8, 4. 
2. The Future Indicative is exceedingly rare, and is found only in Plautus 
and Cato: 
Priusquam istam pignam piignabd; before I fight that battle ; Pi. Pseud. 524. 
8. The Pluperfect Subjunctive is very rare; see the third example 
under IT. 
INFINITIVE. —SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES 
606. The Infinitive is a verbal noun with special characteris- 
tics. Like verbs, it has voice and tense, takes adverbial modifiers, 
and governs oblique cases. ‘ 
607. Rule. — Infinitive. — Many verbs admit the Infinitive 
to complete or qualify their meaning : 
Cupid vidére, qui id audeat dicere, I desire to see who will dare to say 
this ; 0. Phil. 5,2, 6. Proelid supersedére statuit, he decided to avoid (abstain 
from) a battle; Caes.2,8. Désind quaerere, J forbear to inquire. Latiné 
loqui didicerat, he had learned to speak Latin; 8.101,6. Quid facere 
cdgitas, what do you intend to do? Dubitas abire, do you hesitate to de- 
part? Persium non ciird legere, I do not care to read Persius. Débés 
hoe reseribere, you ought to write this in reply. 
1 The Subjunctive in the Imperfect and Pluperfect is sometimes best explained 
like the Subjunctive after Dum, and sometimes like the Subjunctive of the 
historical tenses after cum; see 600, IL.
-P-A-G-E-335
  
  —_ 
ORIGIN AND EARLY USE OF THE INFINITIVE 319 
1, The Infinitive is used especially with transitive verbs meaning to dare, 
desire, determine; to begin, continue, end; to know, learn; to intend, pre~ 
pare ; to hesitate, not to care, refuse ; to owe, be under obligations, etc. 
Nore.— After these verbs the Infinitive is the object of the action, like 
the Accusative with a transitive verb, but with some of them the Subjunc- 
tive is sometimes used ; see 565, 568, etc. 
2. The Infinitive is also used with Intransitive verbs meaning to be able, 
to be wont, be accustomed, etc.: 
Mortem effugere ném6 potest, no one is able to escape death. Riri esse 
soled, I am wont to be in the country. 
ORIGIN, EARLY USE, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFINITIVE 
608. Originally the Latin Infinitive appears to have been made 
up of Dative and Locative forms of a verbal noun. Indeed, in 
early Latin and in the poets, rarely in classical prose, it is used 
in special constructions with nearly the same force as the Dative 
of Purpose or End (425, 3). It is thus used: 
i. With many Intransitive verbs, especially with those which denote 
Motion, e6, abed, venié: 
Ila abiit aedem visere Minervae, she has gone to sce the temple of Minerva; 
Pi. Bac. 900. Ibit aurum arcessere, he will go to get the gold. Non populare 
penatés vénimus, we have not come to lay waste your homes; V.1, 527. 
2. With Transitive verbs in connection with the Accusative : 
Pecus égit altds visere montés,! he drove his herd to visit the lofty moun- 
tains ; H.1,2,7. Quid habés dicere, what have you to say? Dederat comam 
diffundere ventis,! she had given her hair to the winds to scatter ; V. 1, 819. 
3. Sometimes, chiefly in poetry and late prose, with verbs which 
usually take the Subjunctive : 
Gentem hortor amare focds, I exhort the race to love their homes; Y. 8, 133. 
Cuncti sudsérunt Italiam petere, all advised to seek Italy; V.3, 363.

iddneus, a fountain worthy to give its name to the river ; H. E. 1, 16, 12. 
  
1In these examples with transitive verbs, observe that the Accusative and In- 
finitive correspond to the Accusative and Dative under 424, and that the Accusa- 
tive, Dative, and Infinitive correspond to the Accusative and two Datives under 
433.

    320 SYNTAX 
Nore 1.— With adjectives, and participles used as adjectives, the Infini- 
tive, rare in prose, is freely used in poetry in a variety of constructions: 
Cantare peritus, skilled to sing, or in singing; V. Ee. 10, 82. Piger scri- 
bendi ferre labdrem, reluctant to bear the labor of writing ; W.8.1, 4,12. Erat 
dignus amari, he was worthy to be loved. Certa mori, determined to die. 
Vitulus niveus vidéri, a calf snow-white to view; H. 4, 2, 59. 
Nore 2.—The Infinitive also occurs, especially in poetry, with verbal 
nouns and with such expressions as c6pia est, tempus est : 
Cupidd Stygids innare lactis, a desire to sail upon the Stygian lakes; 
Y. 6. 138. Quibus molliter vivere cdpia erat, who had the means for living at 
ease; $.0.17,6.° Tempus est maidra coniri, it is time to attempt greater 
things; L. 6, 18, 13. 
609. Infinitive as Object or Subject. — From this early use of the 
Infinitive to denote the Object or End of the Motion, or Action, 
expressed by the verb, was gradually developed its use as a Gen- 
eral Modifier of the verb and as the Direct Object of the action: 
Eximus liidés visere,! we have come out to see the sports ; PI. Cas. 855. Mor- 
tem effugere ném6 potest, no one is able to escape death. Magna negotia 
volunt agere,! they wish to perform great deeds. Scythis bellum inferre t 
décrévit, he decided to wage war against the Scythians; N.1, 3,1. 
1. From the use of the Infinitive as the direct object of the action 
was developed its use as the Subject of the verb: 
Décrévérunt non dare signum, they decided not to give the signal. Décré- 
tum est nén dare signum, i¢ was decided not to give the signal. 
2. The Infinitive sometimes occurs with Prepositions : 
Multum interest inter dare et accipere, there is a great difference between 
giving and receiving ; Sen. Ben. 5, 10, 1. 
610. Historical Infinitive. —In lively descriptions, the Present 
Infinitive, like the Historical Present, is sometimes used for the 
Imperfect or Perfect Indicative. It is then ealled the Historical 
Infinitive, and, like a finite verb, has its subject in the Nominative :   
Catilina in prima acié versiri, omnia prévidére, multum ipse piignare, 
saepe hostem ferire, Catiline was active in the front line, he attended to every- 
thing, fought much in person, and often smote down the enemy ; 8. C. 60, 4. 
  
1 Visere illustrates this early use of the Infinitive, but agere is the direct 
abject of volunt and inferre of décrévit.
-P-A-G-E-337
EE er ee ee ee eR ee ee eel 
USE OF THE INFINITIVE 321 
1. The Historical Infinitive sometimes denotes customary or repeated 
action: 
Omnia in péius ruere ac retrd referri, all things change rapidly for the 
worse, and are borne backwards ; V. G. 1, 199. 
2. Remember that the subject of an Infinitive, when not historical, is put 
in the Accusative, and that it was originally developed from the direct 
object of the principal verb (414, 415): 
Régem tridunt sé abdidisse, they relate that the king concealed himself. 
Nore. —In this example, régem is the subject of abdidisse, but origi- 
nally it was the direct object of tradunt. 
3. An Infinitive and its subject, with their modifiers, form what is called 
an Infinitive clause, in distinction from the simple Infinitive. Thus, in the 
example just given, régem sé abdidisse is an Infinitive clause. 
611. Passive Construction.— When a Transitive verb, which 
has an Accusative and an Infinitive depending upon it, becomes 
Passive, it may admit one or both of the following constructions: 
1. The Personal construction, in which the noun or pronoun which is 
the object of the active becomes the subject of the passive. Thus, regem 
tradunt sé abdidisse, if made to take the personal construction in the 
passive, becomes réx sé abdidisse traditur, the king is said to have 
concealed himself. 
2. The Impersonal construction, in which the verb is used imperson- 
ally, and the rest of the sentences unchanged, becomes the impersonal 
subject. Thus, régem tradunt sé abdidisse, if made to take the imper- 
sonal construction in the passive, becomes régem sé abdidisse traditur, 
it is said that the king concealed himself. 
Nore 1.—A few verbs admit either the personal or the impersonal con- 
struction, as dicor, itidicor, niintior, putor, and trador. 
Norr 2.—A few verbs generally take the personal construction, as iu- 
beor, vetor, and videor; also, arguor, audior, cOgnéscor, existimor, 
intellegor, invenior, prohibeor, reperior, etc. 
Nore 3.— A few verbs generally take the impersonal construction, as 
adfertur, cOnfitendum est, czéditur, fatendum est, préditur, etc. 
612. A Predicate Noun, or a Predicate Adjective, after an 
Infinitive, or a Participle in a compound tense of an Infinitive, 
agrees with the noun or pronoun of which it is predicated, 
according to the general rules of agreement (893, 394). It is 
thus put: 
HARK. LAT. GRAM.— 22 
   
-P-A-G-E-338
  322 SYNTAX 
1. In the Nominative, when it is predicated of the principal subject: 
Sdcratés paréns philosophiae dici potest, Socrates can be called the father 
of philosophy ; ©. Fin. 2, 1. 
  2. In the Accusative, when predicated of the subject of the Infinitive, 
expressed or understood : 
Ego mé Phidiam esse mallem, I should prefer to be Phidias ; ©. Brut. 78, 257. 
Contentum suis rébus esse maximae sunt divitiae, to be content with one’s 
own is very great wealth; ©. 
  arad. 6, 8, 51. 
Norse 1.—In the compound forms of the Infinitive, esse is often omitted, 
especially in the future : 
Flimen neque hostés transiturds existimabat, nor did he think that the 
enemy would cross the river ; Caes. 6, 7, 5. 
Norn 2.— As a rare exception in early Latin, the participle in the Future 
Active Infinitive occurs with the ending tirum regardless of the gender of 
the subject: 
Alterd té occisiirum ait, alterd vilicum, with one (sword) she says that she 
will kill you, with the other the bailiff ; Pl. Cas, 693. 
  3. Generally in the Dative, but sometimes in the Accusative, when 
predicated of a noun or pronoun in the Dative: 
Patricio tribiind plébis fieri non licébat, it was not lawful for a patrician 
to be made tribune of the people; C. Har. 21,44. Ei cdnsulem fieri licet, i is 
lawful for him to be made consul ; Caes. C. 8, 1,1. 
INFINITIVE CLAUSE AS OBJECT 
613. The Accusative and an Infinitive, or an Infinitive with a 
Subject Accusative, is used as the Object of a great variety of 
verbs, especially of verbs of Perceiving, Thinking, and Declaring : 
Sentimus nivem esse albam, we perceive that snow is white. Némd umquam 
proditori crédendum putiivit, no one ever thought that we ought to trust a 
traitor. Simdnidem primum ferunt artem memoriae protulisse, they say that 
Simonides was the first to make known the art of memory ; ©. Or. 2, 86, 351. 
1. Verbs of Perceiving and Thinking include audid, vided, sentid ; 
cdgits, putd, existimd, créd6, spérd; intellegd, scis, etc. 
2. Verbs of Declaring ate dic6, narr6, niintid, doce6, ostends6, pr6- 
mitt, etc. 
3. Expressions equivalent to verbs of perceiving and of declaring —as 
fama fert, report says; testis sum, I am a@ witness, I testify; conscius
-P-A-G-E-339
USE OF THE INFINITIVE 323 
mihi sum, I am conscious, I know —also admit an Accusative with an 
Infinitive : 
Nillam mihi relatam esse gratiam, tii es testis, you are a@ witness that no 
grateful return has been made to me; C. Fam. 5, 5, 2. 
4. Verbs of Perceiving generally take the Accusative with a Present 
Participle when the object is to be represented as actually seen, heard, 
ete., while engaged in a given act: 
Catdnem vidi in bibliothéca sedentem, I saw Cato sitting in the library ; 
©. Fin. 3, 2,7. Videt sequentés, inum haud procul ab sésé abesse, he sees them 
following, one not far from himself; L. 1, 2%, 8. 
5. Note the following constructions with audi6: 
Sdcratem audid dicentem, J hear Socrates say; C. Fin. 2, 28, 90. Soled 
audire Roscium, cum dicat, J am wont to hear Roscius say; ©. Or. 1, 28, 129. 
Saepe ex socerd med audivi, cum is diceret, I have often heard (from) my 
Sather-in-law say ; ©. Or. 2, 6, 22. 
6. Subjects Compared. — When two subjects with the same predicate are 
compared, and the Accusative with the Infinitive is used in the first clause, 
the Infinitive may be understood in the second : 
Platdnem ferunt sénsisse idem quod PY¥thagoram, they say that Plato held 
the same opinion as Pythagoras ; C. Tuse. 1, 17, 39. 
7. Predicates Compared. — When two predicates with the same subject 
are compared, and the Accusative with the Infinitive is used in the first 
clause, the Accusative may be understood in the second, or the second clause 
may take the Subjunctive with or without ut: - 
Num putatis dixisse eum minacius quam factiirum fuisse, do you think that 
he spoke more threateningly than he would have acted ? ©. Ph. 5, 8,21. Auded 
dicere ipsds potius cultdrés agrérum fore quam ut coli prohibeant, I dare say 
that they will themselves become tillers of the fields rather than prevent them 
from being tilled ; L. 2, 84. 
614. An Infinitive Clause is also used as the Object of verbs of 
Wishing, Desiring, Commanding, and their opposites,’ and of verbs 
of Emotion and Feeling?: 
Té tua frui virtiite cupimus, we desire that you should enjoy your virtue ; 
C. Brut. 97, 331. Pontem iubet rescindi, he orders the bridge to be broken down. 
Léx eum necari vetuit, the luw forbade that he should be put to death. 
Gauded id té mihi suadére, I rejoice that you give me this advice. Minimé 
miramur té laetari, we do not wonder at all that you were pleased. 
  
1 As cupid, opts, vold, ndl6, mAlé, etc.; patior, sind, imperG, iubed; 
* prohibed, vets, etc.; gauded, doles, miror, queror, aegré ferG, etc.
-P-A-G-E-340
  324 SYNTAX 
1. Several verbs involving a Wish or a Command admit the Subjunctive, 
with or without ut or né, when a new subject is introduced : 
Vols ut mihi respondeds, I wish you would answer me ; C. Vat. 6,14. Quid 
vis faciam, what do you wish me to do? Suis imperavit né quod télum in 
hostés réicerent, he commanded his men not to hurl any weapon back upon 
the enemy. 
2. Vol6, ndl6, mal6, and cupid also admit the simple Infinitive when 
no new subject is introduced: 
Vérum audire nin vult, he does not wish to hear the truth. Servire quam 
pignare mavult, he prefers to serve rather than to fight. Scire cupid quid 
reprehendas, I desire to know what you criticise. 
8. On the construction of vol6, n6d16, and mAl6, see also 565, 2. 
4, Verbs of Emotion and Feeling sometimes take a clause with quod, 
that or because, and sometimes with cum, in nearly the same sense : 
Gauded quod té interpellavi, I rejoice that (because) I have interrupted 
you. Dolébam quod socium amiseram, I was grieving because I had lost a 
companion. ‘Tibi gratiais agd, cum tantum litterae meae potuérunt, J thank 
you that my letter had so great influence ; C. Fam. 18, 24, 2. 
  INFINITIVE OR INFINITIVE CLAUSE AS SUBJECT 
615. An Infinitive, or an Infinitive Clause, is often used as the 
Subject of a verb: 
Infinitive. — Diligi ificundum est, to be loved is pleasant. Non est mentiri 
meum, to tell a falsehood is not my way. Peccare licet némini, to transgress 
is lawful for no one. Facere fortia Romanum est, to do brave deeds is 
Roman. Vacare culpé magnum est sdlaicium, to be free from fault is a 
great comfort. Carum esse iucundum est, to be held dear is delightful ; 
©. Fin. 1, 16, 58. 
Infinitive Clause. — Caesari niintiitum est equités accédere, it was an- 
nounced to Caesar that the cavalry was approaching; Caes. 1, 46. .Facinus 
est vincire civem Romanum; scelus, verberare, to bind a Roman citizen is 
an outrage; to scourge him, a crime. Omnibus expedit, salvam esse rem 
publicam, it is important for all that the republic should be safe. 
1. When the subject is an Infinitive or an Infinitive clause, the predicate 
is either a noun or adjective with the verb sum, or a verb used impersonally, 
as in the examples above. 
2. An Infinitive, or an Infinitive clause, may be the subject of another 
Infinitive :, 
Intellegi necesse est esse deds, it ts necessary that it be understood that 
there are gods; 0. N. D.1, 1%, 44.
-P-A-G-E-341
TENSES OF THE INFINITIVE 325 
8. The Infinitive sometimes has a demonstrative or a possessive in agree- 
ment with it: 
Quibusdam hic displicet philosophari, this philosophizing displeases some 
persons ; C. Fin.1,1. Vivere ipsum turpe est nobis, to live is itself ignoble for 
us; cf. C. Att. 13, 28,2. Tuom cdnfertd amare semper, always consider your 
loving (your love affairs); Pl. Cure. 28. 
616. Special Constructions. — An Infinitive Clause is some- 
times used 
1. As a Predicate: 
Exitus fuit dratidnis sibi nillam cum his amicitiam esse posse, ¢he close of 
his oration was that he could have no friendship with these ; Caes. 4, 8. 
Norn. — Occasionally an Infinitive without a Subject is so used: 
  Doctd homini vivere est cé; 
C. Tuse. 5, 88, 111. re, to a learned man to live is to think ; 
2. As an Appositive: 
Oraculum erat datum victricés Athénis fore, an oracle had been given that 
Athens would be victorious. Hoe admiratus sum, mentidnem té héréditatum 
ausum esse facere, I wondered at this, that you dared to make mention of 
the inheritances; ©. Ph. 2, 16, 42, 
3. In Exclamations: 
Té sic vexari, that you should be thus troubled! Méne inceptd désistere 
victam, am I vanquished to abandon my undertaking ? V.1, 37. 
4. In the Ablative Absolute : 
Alexander, audits Daréum movisse, pergit, Alexander, having heard that 
Darius had withdrawn (that Darius had withdrawn having been heard) ad- 
vanced; Curt. 5, 18, 1. 
TENSES OF THE INFINITIVE 
617. The three tenses of the Infinitive, the Present, Perfect, 
and Future, represent the time of the action respectively as 
present, past, or future, relatively to that of the principal verb. 
Accordingly the Present denotes that the action is contempora- 
neous with that of the principal verb, the Perfect, that it is prior 
to it, and the Future, that it is subsequent to it. 
618. The Present Infinitive denotes Contemporaneous Action: 
Nolite id velle quod fieri ndn potest, do not wish that which cannot be 
accomplished. Catd esse quam vidéri bonus malébat, Cato preferred to be  
-P-A-G-E-342
—_—"” 
326 SYNTAX 
good rather than to seem good. Quousque dicés pacem velle té, how tong 
will you say that you desire peace ? 
1. The Present Infinitive, like the Present Indicative (583, 2), is some- 
times used of actions really future: 
Cras argentum dare sé dixit, he said that he would give the silver on the 
morrow ; T. Ph. 5, 31. 
2. After the past tenses of débed, oportet, possum, and the like, the 
Present Infinitive is generally used where our idiom would lead us to expect 
the Perfect; sometimes also after memini, and the like ; regularly in recall- 
ing what we have ourselves experienced : 
Liberds tuds érudire débuisti, you ought to have educated your children; 
©. Ver. 8, 69,161. Ndn suscipi bellum oportuit, the war should not have been 
undertaken. Consul esse potui, I might have been consul. Mé Athénis 
audire memini, I remember to have heard at Athens ; C. Leg. 1, 20, 58. 
619. The Future Infinitive denotes Subsequent Action: 
Amicitiae nostrae memoriam spérd sempiternam fore, I hope that the 
recollection of our friendship will be eternal; C. Am.4,15. Sé éversirum 
civitatem minaibitur, he threatened that he would overthrow the state. 
Pollicitus iis sum mé omnia esse factirum, I promised them that I would do 
everything. Galliae sésé potiri posse spérant, they hope to be able to get 
possession of Gaul. 
1. After spér6, itirS, minor, and polliceor the Future Infinitive is 
generally used, as in the examples just given, though the Present and Perfect 
also occur. Moreover the Present, posse, is freely used with these verbs, 
as in the last example. 
2. Instead of the regular Future Infinitive, the Periphrastic form, futt- 
rum esse ut, or fore ut, with the Subjunctive, generally Present or Imper- 
fect, is sometimes used : 
Spérd fore ut contingat id nobis, J hope (it will come to pass) that this 
will fall to our lot; C. Tuse. 1, 34,82. Non spéraverat Hannibal, fore ut ad sé 
déficerent, Hannibal had not hoped that they would revolt to him; L. 28, 44. 
8. This periphrastic form is somewhat rare, though it is the only form 
admissible in either voice in verbs which want the Supine and the Participle 
in tirus. E 
4, In Passive and Deponent verbs, fore with the Perfect Participle is 
sometimes used with the force of a Future Perfect, to denote completed 
action in future time: 
Possum dicere mé satis adémptum fore, I can say that I shall have ob- 
tained enough; C.Sul.9,27. Débellitum mox fore rébantur, they thought 
that the war would soon be (have been) brought to a close ; L. 28, 18, 6.
-P-A-G-E-343
  
GERUNDIVES AND GERUNDS 327 
620. The Perfect Infinitive denotes Prior Action: 
Platénem ferunt didicisse Pythagoréa omnia, they say that Plato learned 
all the doctrines of Pythagoras; C. Tuse. 1, 17,89. Conscius mihi eram, nihil 
& mé commissum esse, I was conscious to myself that no offense had been 
committed by me. 
1. The Perfect Infinitive is sometimes used where our idiom requires the 
Present, but it generally calls attention to the completion of the action. In 
the active voice this construction is rare except in the poets and in Livy, but 
in the passive it is quite freely used with verbs of wishing, especially with 
vol6, even by the best writers: ss 
Qués pulverem Olympicum collégisse iuvat, whom it delights to collect (to 
have collected) the Olympic dust!; H.1,1,3. Vésanum tetigisse timent 
poétam, they fear to touch the mad poet. Quibus léx cdnsultum esse vult, 
whose interests the law requires us to consult ; OC. Div. ©. 6, 21. 
Nore. —In this construction esse is very often omitted: 
Illés monitds vols, I wish them admonished; ©. C. 2, 12,27. Nodllem factum, 
I should not wish it done ; T. Ad. 165. 
2. The Perfect Passive Infinitive, like the Perfect Passive Indicative, 
sometimes denotes the result of the action. Thus doctum esse may mean 
either to have been instructed, or to be a learned man. In the best prose, 
esse is used if the result belongs to the present time; fuisse, if it belongs 
to past time; but subsequently this distinction between the Infinitive with 
esse and the Infinitive with fuisse gradually disappeared + 
Populum alloquitur sdpitum fuisse régem ictii, she addressed the people, 
saying that the king had been stunned by the blow; L. 1, 41, 5. 
GERUNDIVES AND GERUNDS 
621. The Gerundive is a verbal adjective or participle, which 
is used in several special constructions. With the verb, sum, 
it forms the Passive Periphrastic Conjugation, denoting Duty 
or Necessity. This conjugation may be either Personal or 
Impersonal. 
1. The Periphrastic Conjugation of Transitive verbs generally takes, 
the personal construction : 
Occultae inimicitiae timendae sunt, concealed hostilities are to be feared. 
Caesari omnia erant agenda; aciés instruenda, milités cohortandi, signum 
  
1 Referring to the chariot races at the Olympic Games. 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  328 SYNTAX 
dandum, Caesar had every thing to do (every thing was to be done); to form 
the line, exhort the soldiers, give the signal; Caes. 2, 20, 1. 
  2. The Passive Periphrastic conjugation of Intransitive verbs always 
takes the impersonal construction, and may govern the same case as the 
other forms of the verbs: 
Resistendum senectiiti est ; piignandum contra senectiitem, we must resist 
old age; we must Jight against old age; C. Sen. 11,35. Aut rei pitblicae mihi, 
aut mei obliviscendum est, J must forget either the republic or myself; 
of. L. 8, 7, 16. 
8. Sometimes in Plautus and Lucretius, rarely in later writers, the 
Passive Periphrastic conjugation of transitive verbs takes the imper- 
sonal construction and admits the Accusative : 
  Mi hac nocti agitandumst vigiliis, J must keep watch this night; 
Pi. Trin. $69. Poenas timendumst, we must fear punishment. Viam quam 
nobis ingrediendum est, @ journey upon which we must enter. 
622. The Gerundive is sometimes used as a Predicate Accusa- 
tive to denote the Purpose of the action, chiefly after verbs of 
Giving, Delivering, Sending, Permitting, Undertaking, Caring 
for, etc., — dd, tradd, mittd, suscipid, cid, etc. : 
Praeda diripienda data est, the booty was given up to be plundered, 
L. 22, 52,5. Hos Aeduis ciistddiendds tradit, these he delivered to the Aedui 
to guard. Caesar pontem faciendum ciirat, Caesar has a bridge made. 
623. The Gerundive in direct agreement with a noun in an 
oblique case forms with that noun what is called the Gerundive 
construction : 
Consilia urbis délendae, plans for destroying the city (of the city to bé de- 
stroyed). Locum oppidd condendd cépérunt, they selected a place for found- 
ing a town. Ferrum, rem ad colendés agrés necessiriam, iron, a thing 
necessary in (to or for) cultivating the land. In amicis éligendis, in select- 
ing friends (in friends to be selected). 
1, This construction is confined to transitive verbs, including a few verbs 
originally transitive, though not thus used in classical prose, as ditor, fruor, 
fungor, and potior, etc.: 
Ad haec iitenda, for using these things; T. Meant. 133. Ad suum minus 
fungendum, for discharging his duty. Spés potienddrum castrorum, éhe 
hope of getting possession of the camp. 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  
    GERUNDIVES AND GERUNDS 329 
624. The Neuter of the Gerundive, used impersonally, forms 
the Gerund, a verbal noun which shares so largely the character 
of a verb that it governs oblique cases and takes adverbial 
modifiers : 
Sum cupidus té audiendi, I am desirous of hearing you; C. Or. 2, 4, 16. 
Ars vivendi, the art of living. Ad bene beatéque vivendum, for living well 
and happily ; C. Fam. 6, 1, 3. 
USE OF CASES IN THE GERUNDIVE CONSTRUCTION AND 
: IN GERUNDS 
625. All the oblique cases—the Genitive, Dative, Accusative, 
and Ablative — occur both in the Gerundive constructions and in 
Gerunds, and in general they conform to the ordinary rules for 
the use of cases. 
626. Genitive.— The Genitive in Gerundive constructions and 
in Gerunds is used with nouns and adjectives: 
Gerundive. —Inita sunt cénsilia urbis délendae, plans have been formed 
for destroying the city; C. Mur. 37,80. Platénis studidsus audiendi, desirous 
of hearing Plato. 
Gerund. —Sapientia ars vivendi putanda est, wisdom should be regarded 
as the art of living. Its vocandi senatum, the right of summoning the 
senate. Artem véra ac falsa diitidicandi, the art of distinguishing true 
things from false; C. Or. 2, 38, 157. 
1. In Transitive verbs the Gerundive construction is preferred, as in the 
first and second examples, though the Gerund is often used as in the fourth 
and fifth examples, but with neuter pronouns and adjectives the Gerund is 
regularly used ; thus artem véra diitidicandi, not artem vérérum diiidi- 
candG6rum, because vér6rum may mean of true men. 
2. In Intransitive verbs the Gerund is the regular construction, as in the 
third example. 
3. In the Gerundive construction with the pronouns mel, tui, sui, nostri, 
and vestri, the Gerundive ends in di, as these pronouns were originally pos- 
sessives in the Genitive singular: 
Sui pirgandi causa, for the sake of excusing themselves ; Caes.4,18,5. Copia 
placandi tui (feminine), an opportunity of appeasing you. Vestri adhortandi 
causa, for the purpose of exhorting you. 
4. In rare instances the Genitive of the Gerund occurs with another Geni- 
tive depending upon the same noun:
-P-A-G-E-346
330 SYNTAX 
Licis1 tuendi copia, the privilege of beholding the light ; cf. Pl. Capt. 1008. 
Réiciendi iidicum! potestas, the power of challenging the judges; cf. 0. Ver. 
2, 81, 77. 
5. The Genitive in the Gerundive constructions and in Gerunds sometimes 
denotes Purpose or Tendency : 
Imperium conservandae libertatis fuerat, the government had aimed at the 
preservation of liberty (had been of liberty to be preserved); S.C.6,7. Vereor 
té laudare né id adsentandi facere existumés, I fear to praise you, lest you 
should think that I do it for the purpose of flattery. Proficiscitur cign& 
scendae antiquitatis, he sets out for the purpose of studying antiquity. 
Nore. — Libertatis, in the first example, is in origin a Predicate Genitive 
after fuerat, and the Genitive in the other examples follows the same analogy. 
627. Dative. — The Dative is rare both in Gerundive construe- 
tions and in Gerunds, but it occurs with a few verbs and adjectives 
which regularly govern the Dative: 
Numa sacerdétibus creandis animum adiécit, Numa turned his mind to the 
appointment of the priests. Cum solvendd non essent, since they were not 
able to pay. Tempora démetendis frictibus accommodata, seasons suitable 
for gathering fruits; ©. Sen. 19, 70. Sunt acuendis puerdrum ingeniis nén 
initilés lisiis, games are useful (not useless) for sharpening the intellects 
of boys; Quint. 1, 8, 11. 
1. The Dative of the Gerund with a direct object occurs only in Plautus. 
2. The Dative in these constructions often denotes Purpose, or the End 
for which anything is done, and is sometimes used after certain official names, 
as decemviri, triumviri, comitia, etc.: 
Ea tuendae Syriae parantur, thesé preparations are made for the purpose 
of guarding Syria; Vac. An. 15,4. Comitia cdnsulibus rogandis habuit, he held 
the comitia for the election of consuls ; ©. Div. 1, 17, 88. Decemvirds légibus 
scribendis creavimus, we have appointed decemvirs to prepare laws ; L. 4, 4, 8.      
628. Accusative. — The Accusative ix Gerundive constructions 
and in Gerunds’ is used with a few prepositions, generally with ad: 
Haec rés Caesari difficultatem ad consilium capiendum adferébat, this fact 
presented a difficulty to Caesar in the way of forming his plans; Oaes. 7, 10. 
  
1Here licis, though apparently limiting tuendi, probably depends upon 
copia, and iidicum probably depends upon potestas. 
2The use of the Accusative of the Gerund with a direct object is without 
classical authority.

GERUNDIVES AND GERUNDS 331 
Ad audiendum parati sumus, we are prepared to hear. Inter lidendum, 
during play. In rem piblicam conservandam, on the preservation of the 
republic. 
629. Ablative.—The Ablative of Separation and Source in 
Gerundive constructions and in Gerunds generally takes a 
preposition, — a, ab, dé, &, or ex: 
bribes ; OC. Ver. 2, 58, 142. Déterrére & scribendd, to deter from writing. Dé 
nostrd amicé plaicands, in regard to appeasing our friend. 
1, The Ablative of the Gerundive construction occurs also with pré, and A peciiniis capiendis hominés absterrére, to deter men from accepting 
| in late writers with one or two other prepositions : 
Prd omnibus gentibus cinservandis, for the sake of preserving all races ; 
©. Off. 8, 5, 25. 
2. The Ablative of the Gerundive construction occurs after a comparative 
in the following sentence : 
Nillum officium referenda gratia magis necessirium est, no duty is more 
necessary than that of returning a favor ; ©. Off. 1, 15, 47. 
680. The Instrumental Ablative in Gerundive constructions 
and in Gerunds is generally used without a preposition: 
Loquendi élegantia augétur legendis Sratéribus, elegance of speech is pro- 
moted by reading the orators; ©. Or. 8, 10, 39. Caesar dando, sublevandd, 
igndscends gloriam adeptus est, Caesar obtained glory by giving, aiding, and 
pardoning. Saliitem hominibus dandé, by giving safety to men. Fortia 
facta memorand6, by recounting brave deeds. : 
1. The Gerundive seems at times, especially in the poets, to lose its dis- 
tinctive force and to be nearly equivalent to a present or perfect participle : 
Triginté magnéds volyendis ménsibus (characteristic) orbis, thirty gna 
circles of revolving months; V. 1, 269. 
631. The Locative Ablative generally takes the preposition in, 
but it is sometimes used without it, especially in the poets: 
Briitus in liberanda patria est interfectus, Brutus was slain in freeing his 
country. Virtiités cernuntur in agends, virtues are seen in action. In ami- 
cis éligendis negligentés, careless in choosing friends. In suum cuique tribu- 
end6, in giving to every one his due; ©. Brut. 21, 85. 
1. After prepositions the Ablative of a Gerund with a direct object, as in 
the last example, is exceedingly rare.

SUPINES 
632. The Supine, like the Gerund, is a verbal noun. It has a 
form in um, an Accusative, and a form in wu, generally an Abla- 
tive, though perhaps sometimes a Dative. 
1. The Supine in um governs the same case as the verb: 
Légatos mittunt rogatum auxilium, they send ambassadors to ask aid. 
Supines in um 
633. Rule. —The Supine in um is used with verbs of 
motion to express purpose: 
Ad Caesarem congratulatum convénérunt, they came to Caesar to con- 
gratulate him. Mittit rogatum vasa, he sends to ask for the vases. Légati 
yénérunt rés repetitum, deputies came to demand restitution ; 1. 8, 25, 6. 
1. The Supine in um is sometimes used after verbs which do not directly 
express motion: 
Daturne illa Pamphilé hodié niptum, is she given in marriage to-day to 
Pamphilus ? T. And. 301. Lacedaemonids senem sessum recépisse, that the 
Lacedaemonians welcomed the old man to a seat; C. Sen. 18, 63. 
2. The Supine in um with the verb e6 is equivalent to the forms of the 
Active Periphrastic conjugation, and may often be rendered literally : 
Bonds omnés perditum eunt, they are going to destroy all the good; 
ef. 8. 0. 52, 12. 
8. The Supine in um with iri, the Infinitive Passive of e6, forms, it will 
be remembered (235, 2), the Future Passive Infinitive : 
Briitum visum iri 4 mé puts, J think that Brutus will be seen by me. 
634. The Supine in um is not very common, though it occurs 
in a large number of verbs,’ but Purpose may be denoted by 
various other constructions : 
1. By the Subjunctive with ut, né, qué, qué minus; see 568. 
2. By the Subjunctive in Relative clauses; see 590. 
8. By Gerundives or Gerunds; see 622, 626, 5. 
4. By Future Participles; see 638, 3. 
  
1 According to Draeger, II., p. 829, the Supine in um is found in one hundred 
and seyenty-nine verbs, and also forms an element in the Future Infinitive 
Passive of fifty-seven verbs.

USE OF PARTICIPLES ; 333 
Supines in a 
635. Rule.— The Supine in a is generally used as an 
Ablative; sometimes perhaps as a Dative: 
Quid est tam iticundum auditii, what is so agreeable to hear (in hear- 
ing)? ©. Or.1, 8,31. Dé genere mortis difficile dictti est, it is dificult to 
speak of the kind of death; C.Am.3, 12. Sed ita dictii opus est, but it is 
necessary to say this (so, thus). Incrédibile memoratii est, it is incredible 
to relate. Pudet dict, it is a shame to tell; T 2h      
1. The Supine in i is used with adjectives, as facilis, difficilis ; crédi- 
bilis, incrédibilis ; iticundus, iniicundus; mirabilis, terribilis, etc. ; 
with fas, nefas, opus, and in early or late Latin, with two or three verbs. 
2. The Supine in @ is comparatively rare.1_ The most common examples 
are auditi, aditii, cégniti, dicti, factii ; intellécti, inventi, memorati, 
nati, relati, scitii, tactii, tractati, victi, visi. 
38. It is probable that the Supine in & contained originally the forms both 
of the Dative and of the Ablative, and that such forms as memoratui are 
illustrations of the former : 
Istaec lepida sunt memoratui, these things are fine to relate ; Pl. Bac. 62. 
4. It is generally assumed that the second Supine never takes an’ 
object, but it may take the Ablative with a preposition, as in the second 
example, or an adverb, as in the third. 
PARTICIPLES 
636. The Participle is a verbal adjective which governs the 
same cases as the verb to which it belongs: 
Animus sé nn vidéns alia cernit, the mind, though it does not see itself 
(not seeing itself), discerns other things ; ©. Tuse. 1, 2%, 67. 
1. Remember that participles are sometimes used as substantives (494) : 
Consilid condentium urbés, in accordance with the policy of the founders 
of (those who found) cities. Nihil difticile amanti puto, I think nothing 
difficult for a lover. 
2. Participles used as substantives sometimes retain the adverbial modi- 
fiers which belong to them as participles, and sometimes assume adjective 
modifiers which belong to them as substantives : 
  
1 According to Draeger, II., p. 833, on the authority of E. L. Richter, Dé Supinis 
‘Latinae Linguae, the second Supine is found in one hundred and nine verbs, and 
is used with one hundred and sixty-two different adjectives.

334 SYNTAX 
Non tam praemia sequi récté factdrum quam ipsa récté facta, not to seek 
the rewards of good deeds so much as good deeds themselves; ©. Mil. 35, 96. 
Factum praeclarum atque divinum, an excellent and divine deed ; ©. Ph. 2, 44,114. 
8. A participle with a negative is often best rendered by a participial 
noun with the preposition without: 
Voluptatés ndn Grubéscéns persequitur, he pursues pleasures without 
blushing ; C.N.D.1, 40,111, Natiira dedit istiram vitae, nilla praestitita dié, 
nature has given the loan of life without fixing the day for payment. 
4, The Perfect Participle is often best rendered by a participial or verbal 
noun with of: 
Homérus fuit ante Rémam conditam, Homer lived before the founding of 
Rome (before Rome founded); C. Tuse. 1,1,3. Préditae patriae crimen, the 
charge of having betrayed the country. 
637. Participles are sometimes equivalent to Qualifying Rela- 
tive clauses : 
Omnés aliud agentés, aliud simulantés, improbi, all who do one thing and 
pretend another are dishonest. 
638. Participles are sometimes equivalent to Adverbial clauses. 
1. Participles sometimes denote Time, Cause, Manner, Means: 
Plat scribéns est mortuus, Plato died while writing ; C. Sen. 5,13. Fortis. 
simé piignans interficitur, he is slain while bravely fighting. Reniintiant, se 
perfidiam veritds revertisse, they report that they returned because they feared 
perfidy. Romani gratulantés Horatium accipiunt, the Romans receive Ho- 
ratius with congratulations (congratulating). S61 oriéns diem cdnficit, the 
sun by its rising causes the day; ©. N. D. 2, 40, 102. 
  2. Participles sometimes denote Condition, or Convession : 
Reluctante natiira, inritus labor est, if natwre opposes, effort is vain. Ista 
iam dii exspectans, ndn auded tamen flagitdre, though I have been long 
expecting your treatise, yet I do not dare to ask for it; 0. Ac. 1, 1, 3. 
3. Participles sometimes denote Purpose, the Future in Livy and late 
writers, the Gerundive even in the best authors (622) : 
Rediit, belli cdsum tentatiirus, he returned to try (about to try) the for- 
tune of war; L. 42, 62. Dedit mihi epistulam legendam tuam, he gave me your 
letter to read. 
639. Participles are sometimes used in Latin where principal 
clauses would be required in English: 
Classem dévictam cépit, he conquered and took the fleet (took the fleet 
conquered) ; N. 5, 2, 3
-P-A-G-E-351
  TENSES OF PARTICIPLES 335 
1. Perfect Participles sometimes repeat the action of the preceding verb, 
or give its result: 
Exercitum fundit, fisum persequitur, he routs the army and pursues it 
routed; L, 1, 10, 4. 
640. The Tenses of Participles, Present, Perfect, and Future, 
represent. the time, respectively, as Present, Past, and Future 
relatively to that of the principal verb. Thus, in relation to the 
principal action, the Present represents contemporaneous action, 
the Perfect, prior action, and the Future, subsequent action: 
Mendaci homini né vérum quidem dicenti crédere solémus, we are not 
wont to believe a liar even when he speaks the truth ; ef. 0. Div. 2, 71,146. Uva 
matirata duleéscit, the grape, when it has been ripened (prior action), be- 
comes sweet. Bona semper placitiira laudat, he praises blessings that will 
always please (subsequent action). 
1. The Perfect Participle in deponent and passive verbs is sometimes 
used of present time, and sometimes in passive verbs it loses in a great: 
degree its force as a tense and is best rendered by a verbal noun: 
Isdem ducibus tisus Numidas mittit, employing the same persons as 
guides he sends the Numidians; Caes.2,7,1.. Incénsas perfert navis, he 
reports the firing of the ships (ships on fire); V. 5, 665. 
  2. The Perfect Participle with habed has nearly the same force as 
the corresponding English Perfect with have: 
Equitatum coictum habébat, he had collected the cavalry (had the cavalry 
collected) ; Caes. 1, 15, 1. 
3. Perfect Participles are often used as predicate adjectives to denote 
the Result of the action : 
Id parati sunt facere, they are prepared to do this ; ©. Quinct. 2, 8. 
4. The want of a Perfect Active Participle is sometimes supplied by a 
Temporal Clause, and sometimes by a Perfect Passive Participle in the 
Ablative Absolute: 
Postquam in Trévirds vénit, Rhénum transire cdnstituit, having arrived 
among the Treviri, he decided to cross the Rhine; Caes. 6,9,1. Equitati 
praemissd subsequébatur, having sent forward his cavalry, he followed. 
5. The want of a Present Passive Participle is generally supplied by 
a Temporal clause: 
Cum 4 Caténe laudabar, reprehendi mé 4 céteris facile patiébar, being 
praised by Cato, I cheerfully bore being (to be) censured by the others; 
C. Orator, 18, 41.

INDIRECT DISCOURSE— ORATIO OBLIQUA 
641. Direct and Indirect Discourse. — When a writer or speaker 
expresses thoughts in the original words of the author, he is said 
to use the Direct Discourse, Gratis Récta; but when he expresses 
thoughts, whether his own, or those of another, in any other 
form, he is said to use the Indirect Discourse, Oratis Obliqua. 
The Indirect Discourse regularly depends upon a verb of Saying, 
Thinking, Perceiving, etc. : 
  Direct. — Platd in Italiam vénit, Plato came into Italy. 
Indirect with ferunt.—Platdnem ferunt in Italiam vénisse, they say that 
Pilato came into Italy. 
Direct. — Utilis est scientia, knowledge is useful. 
Indirect with arbitror.— Utilem arbitror esse scientiam, I think that 
knowledge is useful. 
1. Words quoted without change belong to the Direct Discourse: 
Direct. — Duumvirés secundum légem facid, I appoint duumvirs according 
to law. 
Direct with inquit. — Réx ‘‘duumvirds’”? inquit ‘secundum légem facio,” 
the king said, ‘‘ I appoint duumvirs according to law.” 
MOODS AND TENSES IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
Moods in Principal Clauses 
642. Rule. — The principal clauses of the Direct Dis- 
course, on becoming Indirect, take the Infinitive with the 
Subject Accusative when Declarative, and the Subjunctive 
when Interrogative or Imperative: 
Dicd classem magnam superatam esse atque dépressam,! T say that a 
large fleet was conquered and sunk. Caesar respondit sé id factiirum, 
Caesar replied that he would do it. Cat mirari sé aiébat, Cato was wont 
to say that he wondered. Wippias gloviatus est anulum sé suai mani con- 
fécisse,1 Hippias boasted that he had made the ring with his own hards ; 
©. Or. 8, 82, 127.   
  
1In Direct Discourse these examples would read (1) Classis magna superata 
est atque dépressa, (2) id faciam, (3) miror, (4) 4nulum mea& mani con- 
féci. Observe that the pronominal subjects implied in faciam, miror, and 
cdnféci are expressed with the Infinitive: sé facttirum, mirari sé, s6 con- 
fécisse, But the subject is sometimes omitted when it can be readily supplied.
-P-A-G-E-353
INDIRECT DISCOURSE 337 
Ad postulata Caesaris pauca respondit; quid sibi vellet? cir in suas 
possessiOnés veniret,! fo the demands of Caesar he replied briefly: what did 
he (Caesar) wish? why did he come into his possessions? Caes. 1, 44, 7. 
Respondérunt; cir sui quicquam esse imperii trans Rhénum postula- 
ret,1 they replied; why did he demand that anything beyond the Rhine 
should be under his sway? Postulavit eadem, né Aeduis bellum inferret, 
obsidés redderet,? he made the same demands, that he should not make war 
upon the Aedui, and that he should return the hostages. Scribit Labieénd 
cum legione veniat,? he writes to Labienus to come (that he should come) 
with his legion; Caes. 5, 46, 4. 
1. The verb on which the Infinitive depends is often omitted, or only 
implied in some preceding verb or expression, especially after the Sub- 
junctive of Purpose: 
Pythia praecépit ut Miltiadem imperatdrem sibi simerent; incepta prd- 
spera futiira, Pythia ordered that they should take Miltiades as their 
commander (telling them), that their efforts would be successful; N. 1, 1, 3. 
2. Rhetorical Questions — which are questions only in form, as they are 
used for rhetorical effect in place of declarative sentences—take the Infini- 
tive. Here belong most questions which in the direct form have the verb in 
the first or in the third person: 
Respondit, num memoriam déponere posse,® he replied, could he lay aside 
the recollection ? Caes. 1, 14,8. Docébant 4 Caesare conyentira subsidia; quid 
esse levius, etc., they showed that assistance would come from Caesar; what 
was more inconsiderate, ete. ? 
3. Deliberative and Potential Questions eauera lly retain the Subjunctive 
from the Direct Discourse : 
In spem vénerat, sé sine piigna rem cdnficere posse; ciir fortinam pericli- 
tarétur,* he had hoped (had come into the hope) to be able to accomplish the 
work without a battle ; why should he try fortune ? Caes. 0.1, 72, 1. 
4, In the Indirect Discourse, affirmative commands, except after verbs of 
wishing and asking, generally take the Subjunctive without'ut, but negative 
commands take the Subjunctive with né; see examples. 
  
1In Direct Discourse these examples would read (1) quid tibi vis? ctr in 
meas possessi6nés venis? and (2) ctir tui quicquam esse imperii cis 
Rhénum postulas? 
2 In Direct Discourse, (1) n6li Aeduis bellum inferre, obsidés redde, and 
(2) cum legi6ne véni. 
8 Direct Discourse, (1) num memoriam dépdnere possum? = memoriam 
dépdnere non possum, (2) quid est levius? = nibil est levius. 
4 Direct Discourse, cir forttiinam pericliter? 
HARK, LAT, GRAM,— 23

Se a ee 
338 SYNTAX 
5. After iubeS and vet6, commands are regularly expressed by the 
Accusative with the Infinitive, but occasionally by the Subjunctive with 
or without ut or né, especially in poetry: 
Nayvés aedificdri iubet, he orders vessels to be built. Castra miuniri vetuit, 
he forbade the camp to be fortified. Tubétd ut certet Amyntas, bid Amyntas 
be my rival; V. B.5, 15. 
Moods in Subordinate Clauses 
643. Rule. — The subordinate clauses of the Direct Dis- 
course, on becoming Indirect, take the Subjunctive : 
Dicd classem magnam quae ad Italiam raperétur, superatam esse, 
I say that a large fleet, which was hurrying toward Italy, was conquered ; 
©. Man. 8,21. Caesar respondit, sé id quod in Nerviis fécisset, factiirum,? 
Caesar replied that he would do that which he had done in the case of the 
Nervii. Uippias gloriatus est dnulum quem habéret sé sua mani con- 
fécisse,? Hippias boasted that he had made with his own hands the ring 
which he wore. 
1. Clauses introduced by relative pronouns, or by relative adverbs 
-—as ubi, unde, quaré, etc. — sometimes have the force of independent 
clauses, and accordingly take the Infinitive with subject Accusative : 
Ad eum défertur, esse civem R6manum qui quererétur, quem (= et eum) 
adservatum esse, i¢ was reported to him that there was a Roman citizen who 
made a complaint, and that he had been placed under guard ; ©. Ver. 5, 62, 160. 
Déménstrabitur, né si iidicis quidem illa damnata esset potuisse hunc ipsum 
dé ill& supplicium siimere; quaré esse indignum, it will be shown that not 
even if she had been condemned by a court of justice would he have been able 
to inflict punishment upon her ; that therefore it was a disgraceful act. 
2. Clauses introduced by certain conjunctions, as ut, quam, quam- 
quam, quia, and cum, sometimes take the Infinitive with subject 
Accusative, especially in Livy and Tacitus: 
Num putatis, dixisse eum minacius quam factiirum fuisse, do you think 
that he spoke. more threateningly than he would have acted? ©. Ph. 5,8, 21. 
Dicit sé moenibus incliisds tenére eds, quia per ‘Os vagari, he says that he 
keeps them shut up within the walls, because they would wander through the 
fields. Cum interim légem tantam vim habére, when in the mean time the 
law has such force ; 1. 4, 51, 4. 
    
1 Direct, classis magna quae ad Italiam rapiébatur superata est. 
2 Direct, faciam id quod in Nerviis féci. 
8 Direct, Anulum quem habed mea mani conféci.

INDIRECT DISCOURSE 339 
3. Parenthetical and explanatory clauses introduced into the Indirect 
Discourse, without strictly forming a part of it, take the Indicative: 
Referunt silvam esse, quae appellatur Bacénis, they report that there is a 
forest which is called Bacenis; Caes. 6, 10,5. Condriisés, qui Germani ap- 
pellantur, arbitrari ad XL milia, that they estimated the Condrusi, who are 
called Germans, at forty thousand. 
4. Sometimes clauses which are not parenthetical, especially relative 
and temporal clauses, take the Indicative to emphasize the fact stated : 
Certior factus est ex e& parte vici, quam Gallis concesserat, omnés disces- 
sisse, he was informed that all had withdrawn from that part of the village 
which he had assigned to the Gauls ; Caes. 3, 2. 
644. Tenses in the Indirect Discourse generally conform to 
the ordinary rules for the use of tenses in the Subjunctive and 
Infinitive ; but notice the following special points: 
1. The Present and Perfect may be used even after an historical tense, 
to impart a more lively effect to the narrative : 
Caesar respondit, si obsidés sibi dentur, sésé cum iis pacem esse factirum, 
Caesar replied that if hostages should be given to him, he would make peace 
with them; Caes.1, 14,6. Exitus fuit dratidnis, neque illés vacare agrés, qui 
dari possint, the close of the speech was that there were not any lands unoc- 
cupted which could be given. 
2. The Future Perfect in a subordinate clause of the direct discourse 
is changed in the indirect into the Perfect Subjunctive after a principal 
tense, and into the Pluperfect Subjunctive after an historical tense : 
Cum trigeminis agunt régés, ut prd sua patria dimicent; ibi imperium 
fore, unde victdria fuerit, the kings arrange with the triplet-brothers that 
they shall fight for their country ; that the sovereignty shall be on the side 
which shall win the victory (whence the victory shall have been); L. 1, 24, 2. 
PRONOUNS AND PERSONS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
645. In passing from the Direct Discourse to the Indirect, 
pronouns of the first and second persons are generally changed 
to pronouns of the third person, and the first and second persons 
of verbs are generally changed to the third person: 
Hippias gloriatus est, pallium qué amictus esset, sé sué mani! confécisse, 
Hippias boasted that he had made with his own hands the cloak which he wore 
  
1 Direct, ego mea mani. Ego becomes sé, and mea becomes sua, 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
SL Re CO eT ee ee ET Te ae ee ee eee eae 
340 SYNTAX 
(in which he was clad). Respondit si obsidés ab iis sib! dentur, sésé cum 
iis pacem esse factirum, he replied that if hostages should be given to him by 
them, he would make peace with them. 
1. Thus (1) ego is changed to sui, sibi, etc., or to ipse; meus and 
noster to suus; (2) ti to is or ille, sometimes to sul, etc., tuus and 
vester to suus, or to the Genitive of is; and (3) hic and iste generally to 
ille, but hic is sometimes retained. But the pronoun of the first person 
may of course be used in reference to the reporter or author, and the pro- 
noun of the second person in reference to the person addressed : 
Miror té ad mé nihil scribere, I wonder that you do not write anything to 
me; C. Att.8, 12, B. 1. 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
646. Conditional sentences of the First and of the Second 
Form in the Indirect Discourse take the Subjunctive in the 
Condition and the Infinitive in the Conclusion: 
Respondit si quid Caesar sé velit, illum ad sé venire oportére,? he replied 
that if Caesar wished anything of him, he ought to come to him; Caes. 1, 34, 2. 
Id si fieret, intellegébat magn6d cum periculd futiirum,? he understood that if 
this should be done, it would be attended with great danger ; Caes. 1, 10, 2. 
1. The Future Infinitive is the regular construction in the Conclusion of 
the second form, as in the last example. 
2. The Conclusion takes the Subjunctive when it is Imperative or Inter- 
rogative, and when it is brought into such connection as to require that 
mood, as when it is the purpose or result of some other action: 
Scribit Labiénd, si rei piiblicae commodé facere posset, cum legidne 
veniat, he wrote to Labienus to come with his legion, if he could do so con- 
sistently with the interests of the republic ; s. 5,46, 4. Caesar suds copias 
prodixit, ut si vellet Ariovistus proelid contendere, ei potestas non deesset, 
Caesar led out his forces in order that, if Ariovistus wished to fight, he might 
have the opportunity ; Caes. 1, 48, 8. 
  647. Conditional Sentences of the Third Form in the Indirect 
Discourse depending on a verb of Saying, Thinking, etc., retain 
the Imperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive unchanged in the Con- 
dition, regardless of the Tense of the Principal verb, but in the 
  
1 Direct, a VObis mihi... ego vObiscum. Vébis becomes iis, v6biscum 
becomes Cum iis, mihi becomes sibi, and ego, sés6. 
2 Direct, si quid Caesar m6 vult illum ad mé venire oportet. 
8 Direct, id si fiat or fiet, m&gnd cum periculsé sit or erit.

Conclusion they take the Periphrastic Infinitive, the Present in 
trum esse when the condition belongs to present time, and the 
Perfect in trum fuisse when it belongs to past time: 
Respondit, si quid ipsi 4 Caesare opus esset, sésé ad eum ventirum fuisse, 
he replied that, if he needed anything from Caesar, he would have come 
to. him; Caes. 1, 34,2. Clamitabat, neque aliter Carniités consilium fuisse 
captiirds, neque Eburodnés, si ille adesset, ad castra ventiirds esse, he cried 
out that otherwise the Carnutes would not have conceived the purpose, nor 
would the Eburones be coming to our camp ; Caes. 5, 29, 2. 
1. The conclusion of this form of the conditional sentence in the In- 
direct Discourse corresponds to the Periphrastic Indicative in the Direct 
Discourse. Thus, in the first example, the conclusion in the Direct Dis- 
course would be ad té ventiirus fui. Hence we have here the simple 
change from the Periphrastic Indicative to the Periphrastic Infinitive. For 
the close relationship in meaning between the Periphrastic Indicative and 
the regular Subjunctive, see 582, 1. 
2. In the conclusion of conditional sentences of the third form the circum- 
locution, futirum esse ut or fore ut with the Imperfect Subjunctive for 
present time, and futiirum fuisse ut with the Imperfect Subjunctive for past 
time, is used in the passive voice and sometimes in the active: 
Nisi nintii essent allati, existimabant futirum fuisse ut oppidum amitte- 
rétur, they thought that the town would have been lost, if tidings had not 
been brought ; cf. Caes. C. 8, 101, 3. 
8. Remember that in the conclusion of conditional sentences of the 
third form, certain gpecial verbs (583) generally take the ordinary forms 
of the historical tenses of the Indicative. In the Indirect Discourse the 
Perfect Infinitive of course takes the place of this Indicative, and in 
deponent and passive verbs it sometimes occurs where we expect the 
circumlocution : 
Platdnem existimd, si voluisset, gravissimé potuisse dicere, I think that 
Plato could have spoken most forcibly, if he had wished; ©. off.1,1,4. Re- 
spondit, si populus Romanus alicitius initiriae sibf conscius fuisset, ndn fuisse 
difficile cavére, he replied that if the Roman people had been conscious of any 
wrong doing, it would not have been dificult for them to be on their guard. 
Ném6 mihi persuadébit, multds virds tanta esse conatis, nisi cernerent, etc., 
no one will persuade me that many men would have attempted so great 
things, unless they perceived, etc.; C. Sen. 23, 82. 
648. Conditional Sentences of the Third Form depending on 
verbs which require the Subjunctive admit the following con- 
structions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
  342 SYNTAX 
I. If the condition relates to present time, the entire sentence remains 
unchanged : 
Honestum tale est, ut vel si igndrarent id hominés, sua tamen pulchritidine 
esset laudabile, honor is such that, even if men were ignorant of it, it would 
still be praiseworthy because of its own beauty ; cf. C. Fin. 2, 15; 49. 
Il. If the condition relates to past time, the condition remains un- 
changed, but the conclusion, though unchanged in the passive, takes one 
of the following forms in the active: 
1. If it is an indirect question, the Perfect or Pluperfect of the 
Periphrastic Conjugation is used, the tense being determined by the 
general law for the sequence of tenses: 
Dic quidnam factiirus fueris si cénsor fuissés, say what you would have 
done, if you had been censor; L. 9, 33. 
2. If it is not an indirect question, the Perfect Subjunctive of the 
Periphrastic Conjugation is generally used: 
Quis dubitat, quin, si Saguntinis tuliss¢mus opem, tdtum in Hispaniam 
aversiiri bellum fuerimus, who doubts that if we had carried aid to the 
Saguntines, we should have transferred the entire war to Spain? L. 31,7. 
3. But verbs denoting Ability, Duty, etc., possum, oportet, etc., 
generally take the Perfect Subjunctive of the regular conjugation: 
Haud dubium fuit, quin, nisi ea mora intervénisset, castra capi potuerint, 
there was no doubt that the camp could have been taken, if that delay had not 
occurred ; L. 24, 42, 
« 
INDIRECT CLAUSES 
649. Indirect Discourse in its widest application includes, not 
only reported speeches, but all indirect clauses. 
I. Subordinate Clauses containing statements made on the 
authority of any other person than that of the speaker, or on 
the authority of the speaker at any other time than that when 
the statements are reported, regularly take the Subjunctive : 
Laudat Africinum quod fuerit abstinéns,! he praised Africanus because 
he was temperate; C. Off. 2, 22,76. Hospitem inclamavit quod mihi fidem 
habére ndluisset, he rebuked the stranger because he had been unwilling to put 
confidence in me. Privatim petere coepérunt, quoniam civitati cOnsulere non 
  
1Quod . abstinéns, on the ground that, ete., the reason in the ming of 
the eulogist, not of the historian
-P-A-G-E-359
  INDIRECT DISCOURSE 343 
possent,! they began to present their personal petitions, since they could not 
act for the state. Libros qués frater suns reliquisset,? mihi donavit, he gave 
me the books which his brother had left; ©. Att. 2, 1, 12. 
II. Indirect Questions are subordinate interrogative clauses and 
accordingly take the Subjunctive : 
Epaminondas quaesivit salvusne esset clipeus,? Epaminondas inquired 
whether his shield was safe ; cf. C. Fin. 2, 30, 97. Qualis sit animus, animus nescit, 
what the nature of the soul may be, the soul knows not. Quaeritur, cir doctis- 
simi hominés dissentiant, the question is asked why the most learned men 
disagree. Miror cir mé acciisés, I wonder why you accuse me. Ut té 
oblectés scire cupid, I wish to know how you amuse yourself. 
1. The Subjunctive is put in the periphrastic form in the indirect ques- 
tion when it represents a periphrastic form in the direct question: 
Cupid scire ubi sis hiematiirus, I desire to know where you are going to 
spend the winter. 
2. In indirect questions ne and num are used without any perceptible 
difference of meaning: 
Quaesivit, salvusne esset clipeus, he asked whether his shield was safe; 
©. Fin. 2, 30,97. Num quid vellem, rogavit, he asked whether I wished any- 
thing ; C. Att. 6, 3, 6. 
8. Si is sometimes best rendered, to see whether, to sce if, to try if, ete, 
In this sense it generally takes the Subjunctive, but it also occurs with the 
Indicative, especially in the poets: 
Té adeunt, si quid vis, they come to you to see if you wish anything ; 
C. Fam. 3,9,2. Inspice, si possum donata repdnere laetus, see whether I can 
cheerfully return your gifts. 
4. An Accusative, referring to the same person or thing as the subject of 
the question, is sometimes, especially in poetry, inserted as the direct cbject 
of the principal verb: 
Quis tuum patrem, quis esset, audivit, who ever heard who your father 
was (heard of your father who he was) ? ©. Deiot. 11.30. Nodsti Marcellum, 
quam tardus sit, you know how slow Marcellus is. Non mé pernisti, qualis 
sim, you do not know what sort of a person Iam}; T. And. 503. 
  
1 Quoniam . . . ndn possent, since they could not, as they thought. 
2Quos... reliquisset, which he said his brother had left. 
8 Here no question is directly asked; we are simply told that Epaminondas 
asked a question, but this statement involves the question, salvusne est 
clipeus, is my shield safe?
-P-A-G-E-360
  344 SYNTAX 
5, A Personal Passive construction, corresponding to this form of the 
active, is sometimes used, although indirect questions are in general either 
the objects of active verbs or the subjects of impersonal passive verbs: 
Perspiciuntur quam sint levés,! it is seen (they are seen) how inconstant 
they are; ©. Am. 17, 68. 
6. Often in early Latin, as in Plautus and Terence, and sometimes in the 
poets and in late writers, the Indicative is used in indirect questions, or at 
least in questions which would take the indirect form in the best prose: 
Loquere tii, quid puerd factumst, tell what has been done with the boy; 
Pl. Truc. 787. Quin tii dic, quid est quod mé velis, nay, tell what it is, that 
you wish of me; T. And. 45. 
650. Indirect Double Questions are generally introduced by 
the same interrogative particles as those which aré direct (380). 
1. They generally take in the first member utrum, or ne, and in the 
second an, sometimes anne, in the sense of or, and necne, or an nén in 
the sense of or not: 
Difficile dicti est, utrum timuerint, an diléxerint, i is dificult to say 
whether they feared or loved. Quaeritur, sintne di necne sint, the question is 
asked whether or not there are gods; 0. N. D. 1, 22, 61. 
2. But they often omit the particle in the first member, and take in 
the second an, or ne in the sense of or, and necne, or an n6n, in the 
sense of or not: 
Vivat an mortuus sit, quis ciirat, who cares whether he is living or dead ? 
C. Ph. 18, 16,33. Filius nepdsne fuerit parum liquet, whether he was the son or 
the grandson is not at all clear. Sapientia beatds efficiat necne, quaestié est, 
whether or not wisdom makes men happy is a question. 
8. Other forms of indirect double questions, as those with ne... ne, an 
... an, etc., and those without any interrogative particles, are rare or poetic : 
Qui teneant, hominésne feraene, quaerere constituit, he determined to as- 
certain who inhabit them, whether men or beasts; V.1, 308. Velit, ndlit, scire 
difficile est, it is dificult to find out whether he wishes it or does not wish it. 
4, An, in the sense of whether not, implying an affirmative, is used after 
expressions of doubt and uncertainty: dubitG an, nesci6d an, haud sci6 
an, I doubt whether not, I know not whether not =I am inclined to think ; 
dubium est an, incertum est an, it is uncertain whether not = it is probable : 
  
1 Observe that the passive construction corresponds to the active perspici- 
unt, eds quam sint levés, they perceive them, how inconstant they are, a form 
entirely analogous to ndsti Marcellum, quam tardus sit, given above. 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  
  INDIRECT CLAUSES 345 
Dubité an Thrasybilum primum omnium ponam, I doubt whether I should 
not place Thrasybulus first of all (i.e. I am inclined to think I should), 
aud scid an omnium praestantissimus, I am inclined to think the most dis- 
tinguished of all; O.N. D. 2, 4, 11. 
651. Indirect Questions must be carefully distinguished 
1. From clauses introduced by relative pronouns or relative adverbs. 
These always have an antecedent expressed or understood, and are never, 
as a whole, the subject or object of a verb, while indirect questions are 
generally so used : 
Relative. — Ego quod sentid loquar, J shall say what (that which) J think. 
Interrogative. — Dicam quid intellegam, I shall state what I understand. 
2. From clauses introduced by nesci6 quis = quidam, some one, 
nesci6 qué modo = quédam modé, in some way, mirum quantum, 
wonderfully much, wonderfully, etc. These take the Indicative : 
Hic nescid quis loquitur, here some one (I know not who) speaks. Id 
mirum quantum profuit, this profited, it is wonderful how much (i.e. it won- 
derfully profited). Miré quam délectat, how wonderfully it delights. 
652. Clauses closely dependent upon an Infinitive or upon a 
Subjunctive are virtually Indirect clauses, and as such they gen- 
erally take the Subjunctive : 
Quam bellum fuit confitéri nescire quod nescirés, what a fine thing it was 
to admit not to know what you did not know; ©. N.D. 1,30, 84. Recordatione 
nostrae amicitiae sic fruor ut bedté vixisse videar quia cum Scipione vixerim, 
I so enjoy the recollection of our friendship that I seem to have lived happily 
because I have lived with Scipio. Vereor né, dum minuere velim labdrem, 
augeam, I fear that while I wish to diminish the labor, I shall increase it; 
©. Leg. 1, 4,12. Cum timidius ageret quam cdnsuesset, since he acted more 
timidly than had been his custom ; Caes. C. 1, 19. 8. 
1. In clauses dependent upon an Infinitive or upon a Subjunctive, the 
Subjunctive is used, when the dependent clauses are essential to the general 
thought of the sentence, as in the examples just given, but the Indicative is 
used when the clauses are in a measure parenthetical, and when they give 
special prominence to the fact stated, and often when they are introduced 
by dum, especially in the poets and historians: 
Milités misit, ut eds qui figerant persequerentur, he sent soldiers to pursue 
those who had fled (i.e. the fugitives); Caes. 5, 10,1. Tanta vis probitatis est, 
ut eam vel in eis qués numquam vidimus, dilig&imus, so great is the power of 
integrity that we love it even in those whom we have never seen. Petam &

Oratid Récta, into the Indirect, Oratis Obliqua, are further illustrated 
in the following passages from Caesar:

USE OF ADVERBS 347 
USE OF PARTICLES 
USE OF ADVERBS 
654. Rule. — Adverbs qualify Verbs, Adjectives, and other 
Adverbs: 
Sapientés semper féliciter vivunt, the wise always live happily. Rés 
haud sané difficilis, a thing not so very difficult. 
Nore 1.—For Adverbs with nouns used adjectively, see 495, 3; for 
Adverbs in place of adjectives, see 497, 4; for Adverbs with participles 
used substantively, see 636, 2. 
Nore 2. — Sic and ita mean so, thus. Ita has also a limiting sense, as in 
ita... si, so... if, only...if. Aded means to such a degree or result ; 
tam, tantopere, so much. Tam is used mostly with adjectives and adverbs, 
and tantopere with verbs. 
655. The common negative particles are n6n, né, haud. 
1. NGn is the usual negative; né is used with the Optative and Volitive 
Subjunctive and with the Imperative, and haud, in haud scié an and with 
adjectives and adverbs: haud mirabile, not wonderful; haud aliter, not 
otherwise. Né€ nGn after vidé is often best rendered whether. 
656. Two negatives are generally equivalent to an affirmative, as in 
English: 
Aperté adiilantem némé non videt, every one recognizes the open flatterer. 
Nec hoc ille nén vidit, he saw this (nor did he not see this). 
1. N6n before a general negative gives it the force of an indefinite 
affirmative, but after such negative the force of a general affirmative : 
non némé6, some one non nihil, something non numquam, sometimes 
némd non, every one nihil non, everything numquam non, always 
2. After a general negative, né... quidem gives emphasis to the nega- 
tion, and neque... neque, néve... néve, and the like, repeat the negation 
distributively : 
Numquam Scipiénem né minima quidem ré offendi, never hare I displeased 
Scipio even in the smallest thing ; C. Am. 27, 103. Némd umquam neque poéta 
neque Grator, qui quemquam melidrem quam sé arbitrarétur, no one was ever 
either a poet or an orator who thought any one better than himself; ©. Att. 
14, 20, 2. 
8. N6n modo (or slum) n6n, sed né. . . quidem means not only not, 
but not even, and nén modo (sdlum), sed né... quiclem, has the same
-P-A-G-E-364
  
348 SYNTAX 
meaning when the verb standing in the second clause belongs also to the 
first : 
Ego non modo tibi non irascor, sed né reprehendd quidem factum tuum, 
I not only am not angry with you, but I do not even censure your act. 
Adsentatid non modo amico, sed né liberd quidem digna est, flattery is not 
only not worthy of a friend, but not even of a free man; C. Am. 24, 89, 
4. Neque or nec is generally used instead of et n6n: 
Neque mé quisquam cdgnovit, and no one recognized me. 
5. Instead of et with a negative pronoun or adverb, neque or nec with 
the corresponding affirmative is generally used: for et nillus, neque fillus ; 
for et némé6, neque quisquam ; for et numquam, neque umquam: 
Nec amétur ab alld, and may he be loved by no one. 
Nore. — For the use of Prepositions, see 420, 490. 
USE OF COORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS 
657. Copulative Conjunctions (815) meaning and, also, and not, unite 
similar constructions: 
Castor et Polliix, Castor and Pollux. Etiam atque etiam, again and again. 
Senatus populusque, the senate and people. Véni Athénds neque mé quis~ 
quam agnovit, I went to Athens, and no one recognized me ; C. Tuse. 5, 36, 104. 
1. Et simply connects; que implies a more intimate relationship ; atque 
and ac generally give prominence to what follows. Neque and nec have 
the force of etnGn. Et and etiam sometimes mean even. 
Norv. — Atque and ac generally mean as, than, after adjectives and 
adverbs of likeness and unlikeness: talis ac, such as; aequé ac, equally as; 
aliter atque, otherwise than. See also 508, 5. 
2. Que is an enclitic, and ac is used only before consonants. 
3. Etiam, quoque, ade6, and the like, are sometimes associated with et, 
atque, ac, and que, and sometimes even supply their place. Quoque fol- 
lows the word which it connects: is quoque, he also. Etiam, also, further, 
even, often adds a new circumstance. 
4. Copulatives are sometimes used as correlatives: et... et, que... 
que, et... que, que... et, que... atque, neque (nec) ... neque (nec), 
neither ... nor; neque (nec)... et (que), not... but (and); et... neque 
(mec), and not: 
Et praeterita meminit et praesentibus potitur, he both remembers the past 
and possesses the present; C. Fin. 1, 19,62. Mendacium neque dicébat neque 
pati poterat, he neither uttered a falsehood, nor was he able to endure one.

USE OF COORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS 349 
Nore 1.—Modo... modo, cum... tum, tum... tum, now... now, 
not only. . . but also, have the force of copulative correlatives. N6én modo 
(sdlum or tantum)... sed (vérum) etiam, sometimes have the same 
meaning ; see 656, 3. 
Norr 2. — A series may begin with primum or prim6, may be continued 
by deinde followed by tum, posted, praeterea, or some similar word, and 
may close with dénique or postrém6.!_ Deinde may be repeated several 
times between primum and dénique or postrém6.?    
5. Between two words the copulative is generally expressed, though 
it is omitted between the names of consuls: L. Domiti6, Ap. Claudid 
cénsulibus, in the consulship of Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius. 
6. Asyndeton. — Between several words the copulative is in general either 
repeated or omitted altogether. A union of codrdinate words without ‘the 
connective is called Asyndeton: 
Stultitia et temeritis et initstitia, folly, rashness, and injustice ; cf. C. Fin. 
8, 11,39. Cernimus, audimus, gustaémus, olfacimus, tangimus, we see, hear, 
taste, smell, and touch ; O. Div. 2, 8, 9. 
Nore.— Que may be used with the last member of a series even when 
the conjunction is omitted between the other words: aegritiidinés, irae 
libidinésque, griefs, hatreds, and passions.   
  
658. Disjunctive Conjunctions (815, 2) meaning or, either . . . or, offer 
a choice between two objects: 
Tibi ego, aut ti mihi servus es, Zam servant to you or you to me ; PI. Bac. 162. 
Sive retractabis sive properabis, whether you shall be reluctant or in haste. 
1. Aut denotes a stronger antithesis than vel, and is used when one alter- 
native excludes the other: aut vérum aut falsum, either true or false. 
2. Vel, or vel potius, or rather, and vel etiam, or even, are used to 
correct or strengthen a statement: 
Post obitum vel potius excessum Romuli, ajter the death or rather de- 
parture of Romulus ; O. R. P. 2, 12, 52. 
659. Adversative Conjunctions (315, 3) denote Opposition or Contrast: 
Cupid mé esse clémentem, sed mé inertiae condemnd, I wish to be mild, 
but I condemn myself for inaction; 0.0.1, 2,4. Quod autem laudabile est, 
honestum est, but what is laudable is honorable. 
1. Sed and vérum generally mark a direct opposition ; autem and vérd 
only a transition ; at emphasizes the opposition ; atqui often introduces an 
objection ; céterum means but still, as to the rest ; tamen, yet. 
  
1 For examples, see C. Fam. 15, 14; Diy. 2, 56. 
2C, Iny. 2, 49, has a series of ten members in which primum introduces the 
first member, postr6m6 the last, and deinde each of the other eight.

350 SYNTAX 
2, Autem and vér6 are postpositive, i.e. they are placed after one or 
more words in their clauses. 
660. Ilative Conjunctions (815, 4) denote Inference: 
Nihil obstat ; ergs omnia présperé, igitur beaté, there is no opposition, 
therefore all things are moving prosperously, therefore happily ; C. Tuse. 5, 18, 53. 
1. Igitur is generally postpositive: hic igitur, this one therefore. 
661. Causal Conjunctions (815, 5) denote Cause: 
Ném6 enim maeret sud incommods, for no one mourns over his own mis- 
fortune ; C. Tuse. 1, 18, 80. 
1. Enim is postpositive; etenim and namque are stronger than enim

662. For convenience of reference, the principal Rules of 
Syntax are here introduced in a body.

ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS AND CLAUSES 
663. The Latin allows great variety in the arrangement of 
the different parts of the sentence, thus affording peculiar facili- 
ties both for securing proper emphasis and for imparting to its 
periods that harmonious flow which characterizes the Latin 
classics. But with all this freedom and variety, there are certain 
general laws of arrangement which it will be useful to notice. 
ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS IN A SIMPLE SENTENCE 
General Rules 
664. The Subject followed by its modifiers occupies the first 
place in the sentence, and the Predicate preceded by its modifiers 
the last place:   Sdl oriéns et occidéns diem noctemque conficit, the sun by its rising and 
setting makes day and night. Scipid Africanus Carthiginem Numantiamque 
délévit, Scipio Africanus destroyed Carthage and Numantia ; ©. ©. 4, 10, 21. 
1. The Modifiers of the Subject either follow it or are grouped around 
it. Substantive modifiers generally follow it, while Adjective modifiers 
may stand either before or after it; see 671, 1-5: 
Cluilius réx moritur, Cluilius the king dies. Vérae amicitiae sempiternae 
sunt, true friendships are enduring. Hominés industrii in Asia negdtiantur, 
active men are engaged in business in Asia. 
2. In the arrangement of the modifiers of the Predicate the place 
directly before the verb is generally occupied by the Direct object, or by 
an Adverb which directly qualifies the action: 
Fortiter bellum gesserat, he had waged war valiantly ; C. Flac. 39,98, Rem 
piiblicam félicissimé gessérunt, they administered the republic most success- 
fully ; Caes, 0.7, 7 
3. In the arrangement of Objects the Indirect object generally stands 
before the Direct: 
Daréus Scythis bellum inferre décrévit, Darius decided to make war upon 
the Scythians. 
4. Expressions of Place, Time, or Means generally stand before the 
other modifiers of the verb, often even before the subject: 
Athéniénsés locd iddned castra fécérunt, the Athenians pitched their camp 
ina suitable place. Proxim6 dié Caesar 6 castris utrisque cOpids suds édixit,
-P-A-G-E-375
Oe se ee ee 
ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS 359 
the next day Caesar Icd out his forces from both his camps; Caes. 1, 50. 
Marius commeatii navés onerat, Marius loads his vessels with supplies. 
665. Emphasis and the relative importance of different parts 
of the sentence often cause a departure from the Grammatical 
arrangement just described. Thus, 
1. Any word, except the subject, may be made emphatic by being 
placed at the beginning of the sentence: 
Catdénem quis nostrérum dratdrum legit, who among our orators reads 
Cate? C.Brut.17,65. Numitdri Remus déditur, Remus ts delivered to Numitor. 
2. Any word, except the predicate, may be made emphatic by being 
placed at the end of the sentence: 
Nobis non satisfacit ipse Démosthenés, even Demosthenes does not satisfy 
us; ef. C. Or. 29, 104. 
8. In any phrase within a sentence the emphatic word stands first: 
     Mihi ani conservatae rei piblicae gratulatisnem décrévistis, to me alone 
you have decreed a thanksgiving for having preserved the republic ; 0.0.4, 10, 20. 
4. Two words naturally connected, as a noun and its adjective, or a 
noun and its limiting Genitive, are sometimes made emphatic by sepa- 
ration: 
Obiiirgitionés non numquam incidunt necessariae, sometimes necessary 
reproofs occur ; O. Off. 1, 88, 136. 
Norr.— A word is sometimes made emphatic by being placed between 
the parts of a compound tense or between né and quidem: 
Codnsuétidd imitanda medicdrum est, the custom of physicians should be 
imitated ; ©. Off. 1, 24, 88. Né illud quidem, not even that. 
666. Two groups of words may be made prominent and em- 
phatic either by Anaphora or by Chiasmus. 
1. Anaphora. — Here the order of words in the second group is identi- 
cal with that in the first: 
Mé cuncta Italia, mé dniversa civitdés cénsulem déclarivit, me all Italy, 
me the whole state proclaimed consul ; ©. Pis. 1,3. 
2. Chiasmus. — Here the order of words in the first group is reversed 
in the second: 
Fragile corpus animus sempiternus movet, the imperishable soul moves 
the perishable body; C0.R.P. 6,24. Satis @loquentiae, sapientiae parum, 
enough eloquence, but little wisdom.

360 SYNTAX 
667. Kindred Words. — Different forms of the same word, 01 
different words of the same derivation, are generally placed near 
each other. 
Ad senem senex dé senectiite scripsi, J, an old man, wrote to an old man 
about old age; 0. Am. 1. 
668. A word which has a common relation to two other words 
connected by conjunctions, is placed. 
1. Generally before or after both: 
Graccis et litteris et doctoribus, by means of Greek literature and Greek 
teachers; C.Tuse.1,1. Et belli et pacis artibus, by the arts both of war and 
of peace; L.1, 21. 
Nore. — But a Genitive, or an adjective, following two nouns, more fre» 
quently qualifies only the latter : 
Percunctatis ac dénintiatid belli, the inquiry and the declaration of war. 
2. Sometimes directly after the first, before the conjunction: 
Hondris certamen et gloriae, a struggle for honor and glory; C. Am. 10. 
669. Moreover, the context often has some share in determining 
the arrangement of words in the sentence. Thus, 
1. A word or phrase closely related to some part of the preceding 
sentence generally stands at or near the beginning of its own sentence: 
In his castris Albanus réx moritur, in this camp the Alban king dies. 
Nor. —In his castris refers back to castra in the preceding sentence. 
2. A word or phrase closely related to some part of the following 
sentence stands at or near the end of its sentence: 
Apud Helvétids longé ndbilissimus fuit Orgetorix, among the Helvetii by 
Sar the highest of the nobles was Orgetoriz. Is coniiratidnem ndbilitatis 
fécit, he formed a conspiracy of the nobles. 
670. Euphony and Rhythm. — The best Latin writers in the arrange- 
ment of words regard sound as well as meaning. They aim at variety in 
the length, sound, and ending of successive words and’ pay special atten-. 
tion to the manner in which the sentence closes. A word of two or more 
syllables with a clear and full sound is generally selected for this place : 
Publius Africanus, Carthagine déléta, Siculdrum urbés signis monumen- 
tisque pulcherrimis exdrnavit, Publius Africanus, having destroyed Carthage, 
adorned the cities of the Sicilians with the most beautiful statues and monw 
ments ; C. Ver. 2, 2, 3.

ARRANGEMENT OF WORDS 361 
Special Rules 
671. The Substantive Modifiers of a Noun generally follow it, 
but Adjective Modifiers may stand either before or after it:

Minerva; N.4,5,2. Usus magister est optimus, experience is the best teacher. 
Tuscus ager Roman adiacet, the Tuscan territory borders on the Roman. 
1. Modifiers, when emphatic, generally stand before the noun: 
Catonis drationés, Cato’s orations ; Xenophontis libri, Xenophon’s books. 
2. In afew expressions, the Genitive has a definite position before its 
noun and in a few others a definite position after it: 
Magister equitum, the master of the horse; tribinus plébis, tribune of the 
people; tribinus militum, tribune of the soldiers, etc.; senatiis auctoritas, 
the authority of the senate ; senatiis cOnsultum, a decree of the senate.

Civis Rémanus, ¢ Roman citizen; populus Romanus, the Roman people ; 
pontifex maximus, the chief priest ; di immortalés, the immortal gods ; genus 
himanum, the human race ; itis civile, civil law, ete. 
  4, When a noun is modified by an Adjective and a Genitive, the usual 
order is Adjective — Genitive — Noun: 
Omnés Graeciae civitatés, all the states of Greece. 
5. An Adjective is often separated from its noun by a monosyllabic 
preposition and sometimes by two or more words : 
Magno cum periculd, with great peril; maxima post hominum memoriam 
classis, the largest jleet in the memory of man; N. 2,5. 
672. Modifiers of Adjectives. — Adverbial modifiers generally 
stand before adjectives while Objective modifiers more commonly 
follow them: 
Exspectatid valdé magna, a very great expectation. Appetentés gloriae 
atque avidi laudis, eager for glory and desirous of praise. 
673. The Modifiers of verbs generally stand before them (664): 
Mors propter brevitatem vitae numquam longé abest, death is never far 
distant in consequence of the shortness of life ; cf. C. Tuse. 1, 88, 91. 
Norr. — When the verb stands at the beginning of the sentence the modi- 
fiers of course follow it and may be separated from it 
Silent légés inter arma, laws are silent in war; ©. Mil. 4, 10. 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
  362 SYNTAX 
674. Modifiers of adverbs generally stand before them, but a Dative 
depending on an adverb usually follows it: 
Illud valdé graviter tulérunt, they bore this with great displeasure. Con: 
gruenter natiirae vivit, he lives in harmony with nature. 
675. Pronouns. — Possessives generally follow the nouns to which they 
belong, but other pronominal adjectives generally precede their nouns, 
Demonstratives and Interrogatives regularly : 
Cdpias suas divisit, he divided his forces. Cistds hitius urbis, the guardian 
of this city. In qua urbe vivimus, in what sort of a city are we living ? 
1. Ile in the sense of well-known usually follows its noun, if not accom- 
panied by an adjective: Médéa illa, that well-known Medea, but Magnus 
ille Alexander, that famous Alexander the Great. 
2. Pronouns are often grouped together, especially quisque with suus 
or sui: 
Per sé quisque sibi carus est, every one is by his own nature dear to him~ 
self; C. Am. 21, 80. 
676. Prepositions generally stand directly before their cases, but tenus 
and versus follow their cases: 
Tauré tenus, as far as Taurus. Narbdnem versus, towards Narbo. 
1. The preposition frequently follows the relative, sometimes other pro- 
nouns, and sometimes even nouns, especially in poetry : 
Ttaliam contra, over against Italy; quibus dé, in regard to which; hune 
post, after him. See also 175, 7; 182, 2. 
2. Genitives, adverbs, and a few other words sometimes stand between the 
preposition and its case. In adjurations per is usually separated from its case: 
Ad earum rérum facultatem, to a supply of those things. Ad bene beaté. 
que vivendum, for living well and happily. Per ego has lacrimas té 6rd, 
T implore you by these tears; V. 4, 814.    
677. Conjunctions and Relatives, when they introduce clauses, gen- 
erally stand at the beginning of such clauses: but autem, enim, quidem, 
quoque, véré, and generally igitur, follow some other word: 
Si haec civitis est, if this is a state. Ti qui audiunt, those who hear. Ipse 
autem omnia vidébat, but he himself saw everything. See also 659, 2, and 
660, 1. 
1. Conjunctions and relatives may follow emphatic words: 
Id ut audivit, as he heard this. Trdiae qui primus ab Gris vénit, who came 
first from the shores of Troy; V.1,1.
-P-A-G-E-379
  
    ARRANGEMENT OF CLAUSES 363 
2. Que, ve, ne, introducing a clause or phrase, are generally appended to 
the first word ; but if that word is a preposition, they are often appended to 
the next word : 
In fordque, and in the forum. Inter ndsque, and among us. 
678. Non, when it qualifies some single word, stands directly before 
that word; but when it is particularly emphatic, or qualifies the entire 
clause, it sometimes stands at the beginning of the clause, and sometimes 
before the finite verb or before the auxiliary of a compound tense: 
Hom6 non probatissimus, a man by no means the most approved. Non fuit 
Juppiter metuendus, Jupiter was not to be feared. Pecinia soliita non est, 
the money has not been paid. 
1. In general, in negative clauses the negative word, whether particle, 
verb, or noun, is made prominent : 
Nilla vidébatur aptior persona, there seemed to be no more fitting char- 
acter. Nihil est melius, nothing is better. 
679. Inquam, soinetimes aid, introducing a quotation, follows one or 
more of the words quoted : 
Nihil habed, inquit, quod acciisem senectiitem, I have nothing, said he, 
of which to accuse old age; 0. Sen. 5, 18. 
680. The Vocative rarely stands at the beginning of a sentence. It 
usually follows an emphatic word: 
Vos, Quirités, in vestra técta discédite, you, Romans, retire to your homes. 
ARRANGEMENT OF CLAUSES 
681. Clauses connected by coérdinate conjunctions (315, 1) fol- 
low each other in the natural order of the thought, as in English: 
Sol ruit et montés umbrantur, the sun hastens to its setting, and the moun- 
tains are shaded. GyYgés & niilld vidébatur, ipse autem omnia vidébat, Gyges 
was seen by no one, but he himself saw all things. 
682. A clause used as the Subject of a compound sentence (386, 2) 
generally stands at the Beginning of the sentence, and a clause used as 
the Predicate at the End: 
Quid diés ferat incertum est, what a day may bring forth is uncertain. 
Exitus fuit dratidnis, sibi nillam cum his amicitiam esse, the close of the 
oration was, that he had no friendship with these men.

364 SYNTAX 
1. This arrangement is the same as that of the simple sentence ; see 664. 
2. Emphasis and euphony often have the same effect on the arrangement 
of clauses as on the arrangement of words ; see 665, 670. 
683. Clauses used as the Subordinate Elements of compound 
sentences admit three different arrangements. 
1. They are generally inserted within the principal clause, like the 
subordinate elements of a simple sentence: 
Ariovistus, ex equis ut colloquerentur, postulavit, Ariovistus demanded 
that they should converse on horseback; Caes. 1, 43. Libenter hominés id 
quod volunt crédunt, men willingly believe that which they wish ; Caes. 8, 18, 6. 
2. They are often placed before the principal clause: 
Cum quiéscunt, probant, while they are quiet, they approve. Quillis sit 
animus, animus nescit, the soul knows not what the soul is. 
Nore. — This arrangement is generally used when the subordinate clause 
either refers back to the preceding sentence, or is preparatory to the thought 
of the principal clause. Hence Causal, Temporal, Conditional, and Conces- 
sive clauses often precede the principal clause, and in sentences composed 
of correlative clauses with is ... qui, talis ... qualis, tantus... quantus, 
tum...cum, ita... ut, etc., the relative member, i.e. the clause with qui, 
qualis, quantus, cum, ut, etc., generally precedes. 
3. They sometimes follow the principal clause : 
Enititur ut vincat, he strives that he may conquer. S0l efficit ut omnia 
floreant, the sun causes all things to bloom. 
Nore. — This arrangement is generally used when the subordinate clause 
is either intimately connected in thought with the following sentence, or ex- 
planatory of the principal clause. Hence, clauses of Purpose and Result 
generally follow the principal clause, as in the examples. 
684. When cither the subject or the object is the same both in the 
Principal and in the Subordinate clause, it usually stands at or near the 
beginning of the sentence and is followed by the subordinate clause : 
Hostés ubf primum nostrds equités cOnspexérunt, celeriter nostrds pertur- 
bavérunt, the enemy, as soon as they saw our cavalry, quickly put our men to 
rout; Caes. 4,12. Illa ut potui tult, those things I endured as (well as) I could. 
1. When the object of the principal clause is the same as the subject of 
the subordinate clause, it usually stands at the beginning of the sentence : 
VGs moneé ut forti animé sitis, J cownsel you to be of a courageous spirit.

  LATIN PERIODS 365 
685. Latin Periods. — A carefully elaborated Latin sentence con- 
sisting of one or more subordinate clauses inserted in the princi- 
pal clause, or placed before it, and so combined with it and with 
each other as to make one complete organic whole, is a Latin 
Period: 
Ut quod turpe est, id quamvis occultétur, tamen honestum fieri niill6 modd 
potest ; sic quod honestum non est, id itile ut sit effici nén potest, as that 
which is base, although it may be concealed, can in no way be made honor- 
able, so that which is not honorable can not by any possibility be made useful ; 
C. Off. 8, 19, 78. 2 
Ut saepe hominés aegri morbd gravi, cum aestii febrique iactantur, si 
aquam gelidam bibérunt, primd relevari videntur, deinde multd gravius 
vehementiusque adflictantur, sic hic morbus qui est in ré piblica, relevatus 
istius poena, vehementius vivis reliquis ingravéscet, as men ill with a severe 
disease if they take cold water when they are tossed with heat and fever, often 
seem at jirst to be relieved but afterwards are much more grievously and vio- 
lently distressed, so this disease which is in the republic, though alleviated 
by the punishment of this one, will gain greater strength while the rest are 
alive; C. C.1, 18, 81. 
Nore 1. — The examples under 683, 1, and the first example under 684, are 
also short and simple illustrations of the periodic structure, so popular with 
Latin writers.

PART V.— PROSODY 
686. Prosody treats of Quantity and Versification. 
QUANTITY 
687. A syllable is long if it contains a diphthong or a long 
vowel, or is the result of contraction: haec, dicé, nil. 
1. Prae in composition is usually. short before a vowel: praeaciitus.
-P-A-G-E-382
  366 PROSODY 
688. A syllable is long if its vowel is followed in the same 
word by a double consonant, or any two consonants except a 
mute and a liquid?: dux, servus, sunt. 
1. A syllable is also long before two consonants, even if only one of them 
belongs to that word; and in the thesis (725) of a foot it is generally long 
before a double consonant or two single consonants at the beginning of the 
following word. 
Nore 1,—The aspirate h never affects the quantity of a syllable. 
Norr 2.—In the early poets a short final syllable ending in s often re- 
mains short before a word beginning with a consonant; sometimes, also, 
short final syllables ending in other consonants remain short in that situation, 
2. A syllable is long before i consonant, except in the compounds of 
iugum. Even in the compounds of iacié with monosyllabic prepositions 
the first syllable is long, although i consonant is suppressed in writing; 
abici6, adicis. 
8. In the early poets many syllables, long by position in the Augustan 
poets, are sometimes short, as the first syllable of ecce, ille, imm6, nempe, 
omnis, quippe. 
Norz.—In Greek words a syllable with a vowel before a mute and a 
nasal is sometimes short: cycnus, Tecméssa. 
689. A syllable is short if its vowel is followed in the same 
word by another vowel, by a diphthong, or by the aspirate h: 
diés, viae, nihil. But a few exceptions occur. 
1. For a before another vowel, see 79, 3, and note proper names in dius: 
aulai, Gaius. 
2. For é or & before a vowel, see 184: diéi, fidéi, réi, spéi, and note 
éheu and Rhéa. 
3. For i or i before a vowel, see 98, 4, 179, and 296: fiam, fiébam, but 
fieri ; illius, totius, but alterius. Note also dius, Diana. 
Norr.— In Greek words, vowels are often long before vowels because long 
‘in the original: Médéa, 4ér, Aenéas, Trdes. 
690. A syllable is common in quantity if its vowel, naturally 
short, is followed by a mute and a liquid: agri, patris. 
  
1 Here the syllable is long by nature if the vowel is long, but long only by 
position if the vowel is short. For the hidden quantity of vowels before two 
consonants or a double consonant, see 749.
-P-A-G-E-383
  
QUANTITY OF FINAL SYLLABLES 367 
1. A syllable ending in a mute in the first part of a compound before a 
liquid at the beginning of the second part is long: ab-rumpé6, ob-rogé. 
2. In Plautus and Terence a syllable, not in a compound, is short before 
a mute and a liquid if its vowel is short. 
QUANTITY OF FINAL SYLLABLES 
691. Monosyllables are generally long: da, si, dd, dds, pés, sis, 
bos, par, sol. But note the following exceptions: 
1. Enclitics: que, ve, ne, ce, te, pse, pte. 
2. Monosyllables in b, d, 1, m, t: ab, ad, fel, sum, et; except sal, sdl 
8. Ac, an, bis, cis, cor, es, fac, fer, in, is, nec, os, per, ter, quis, vir, 
vas, and hic and hic in the Nominative and Accusative. 
692. In words of more than one syllable 
1. The final vowels i, 0, and u are long; a, e, and y, short: 
audi, servo, friictii; via, mare, misy. 
2. Final syllables in c are long; in d,1,m, n, x, t, short: illic; 
illud, consul, amem, carmen, amor, caput. 
Norr. — Donec and lién are exceptions; also final syllables in n and r in 
many Greek words. 
3. The final syllables as, es, and os are long; is, us, ys, short: 
amas, ntibés, servos; avis, bonus, chlamys. 
Nore 1.— Plautus retains the original quantity of many final syllables 
usually short in the Augustan age. Thus the endings 4, &, al, ar, 6r, is, 
Us, at, 6t, It, often stand in place of the later endings a, e, al, ar, or, is, us, 
at, et, it. Some of these are retained by Terence, and occasionally by the 
Augustan poets. 
Nore 2.— Plautus and Terence often shorten final syllables after an 
accented short syllable: ama, dedi, domi, viro, pedes. 
Nore 3. — In Plautus and Terence the doubling of a letter does not neces- 
sarily affect the quantity of the syllable: 11 in ille, mm in immé. 
693. TI final, usually long, is short in nisi, quasi; common in mihi, tibi, 
sibi, ib, ubi; and short or common in a few Greek words. 
694, O final, usually long, is short in duo, ego, eho, cedo, cito, Tico, 
modo and its compounds, and sometimes in nouns of the Third Declension 
and in rerbs, though rarely in the best poets.

Declension: epitomé; dié; tempé. Hence in hodié, pridié, postridié, 
quaré. 
2. In the singular Imperative Active of the Second Conjugation: moné, 
docé. But e is sometimes short in cavé, vidé, etc., and in the comic poets 
many dissyllabic Imperatives with a short penult shorten the ultimate: as 
habe, iube, mane, move, tace, tene, etc. 
3. In feré, fermé, Shé, and in adverbs from adjectives of the Second 
Declension: docté, récté ; except bene, male, and sometimes in the early

697. As final, usually long, is short in a few forms, chiefly Greek: anas, 
Arcas, lampas ; Arcadas, hérGdas. 
698. 3s final, usually long, is short 
1. In the Nominative singular of the Third Declension with short increment 
(702) in the Genitive: miles, sometimes milés in Plautus, obses, interpres ; 
except abiés, ariés, pariés, Cerés, and compounds of pés, as bipés. 
2. In penes and the compounds of es, as ades, potes.

tive: Quiris, Salamis. 
3. In the singular Present Indicative Active of the Fourth Conjugation : 
audis. 
4. In the singular Present Subjunctive Active: possis, velis, ndlis. 
5. Sometimes in the singular of the Future Perfect and of the Perfect 
Subjunctive: amaveris, docueris. 
6. In early Latin sometimes in pulvis, cinis, and sanguis. 
Nore. -- Mavis, quivis, and utervis retain the quantity of vis.

QUANTITY IN INCREMENTS 369 
701. Us final, usually short, is long (1) in Nominatives of the Third 
Declension increasing long in the Genitive : virtis, telliis, but palus occurs 
in Horace; (2) in the Fourth Declension, in the Genitive singular, and in 
the plural: friictiis ; and (3) generally in Greek words ending long in the 
original: Panthis, tripiis. 
  . QUANTITY IN INCREMENTS 
702. A word is said to increase in declension, when it has in any case 
more syllables than in the Nominative singular, and to have as many 
increments of declension as it has additional syllables: sermé, sermé- 
nis, serm6nibus.? 
703. A verb is said to increase in conjugation, when it has in any 
part more syllables than in the second person singular of the Present 
Indicative Active, and to have ‘as many increments of conjugation as it 
has additional syllables: am&s, amatis, amAbatis.? 
704. If there is but one increment, it is uniformly the penult; if there 
are more than one, they are the penult with the requisite number of syl- 
lables before it. The increment nearest the beginning of the word is 
called the First increment, and those following this are called succes- 
sively the Second, Third, and Fourth increments.® 
Increments of Declension 
705. In the Increments of Declension, a and o are long; e, i, u, 
and y, short:* aetas, aetatibus; sermd, sermOnis; puer, puerdrum; 
miles, militis; fulgur, fulguris; chlamys, chlamydis. 
Nore. — The quantity in the increments of Greek nouns is best learned 
from the dictionary. It is usually that of the original Greek.

first increment (1) of masculines in al and ar: Hannibal, Hannibalis ; 
Caesar, Caesaris; (2) of nouns in s preceded by a consonant: daps, 
dapis ; Arabs, Arabis ; and (3) of lar, nectar, par; mas, vas; sal, fax, 
and a few other words.

3 In ser-m6n-i-bus, the first increment is MGn, the second i; and in mon-u- 
e-ra-mus, the first is u, the second e, the third ra, 
4# ¥ occurs only in Greek words, and is long in the increments of nouns in yn.

VERSIFICATION 
GENERAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT 
720. Latin Versification is based upon Quantity. Syllables are 
combined into certain metrical groups called Feet, and feet, singly 
or in pairs, are combined into Verses."   
1 Modern versification is based upon Accent. An English verse is a regular 
combination of Accented and Unaccented syllables, but a Latin verse is a similar 
combination of Long and Short syllables. The rhythmic accent, or ictus (724), 
in Latin depends entirely upon quantity. Compare the following lines: 
Tell’ me not’, in mourn’-ful num’-bers, 
Life’ is but’ an emp’-ty dream’. 
Tri’-di- tur’ di- | és’ di- | a. 
At’ fi- dés' et in’-ge- ni’. 
Observe that in the English lines the accent, or ictus, falls upon the same syllables 
asin prose, while in the Latin it falls uniformly upon long syllables. 
 
-P-A-G-E-389
    
GENERAL VIEW OF VERSIFICATION 373 
1, In quantity or time the unit of measure, called a Time or Mora, is a 
short syllable indicated either by a curve U or by an eighth note in music, N. 
A long syllable has in general twice the value of a short syllable, and is 
indicated either by the sign —, or by a quarter note in music, |. 
2. Triseme.— A long syllable is sometimes prolonged so as to have the 
value of three short syllables, indicated by the sign __, or a 
3. Tetraseme.— A long syllable is sometimes prolonged so as to have 
the value of four short syllables, indicated by 4, or a: 
4, A long syllable is sometimes shortened so as to have approximately 
the value of a short syllable, and is marked by the sign >; and two short 
syllables sometimes seem to have approximately the value of one, and are 
marked YW. Syllables thus used are said to have Irrational time. 
5. The final syllable of a verse, often called syllaba anceps (doubtful 
syllable), may generally be either long or short at the pleasure of the poet. 
721. The feet of most frequent occurrence in the best Latin 
poets are 
1, Freer or Four Times or Four Moran 
Dactyl one long and two short BE Gay a eo Py carmina 
Spondee two long syllables gars, i Aj légés

Nore 2.—A Dipody is a group of two feet; a Tripody, of three; a 
Tetrapody, of four; etc. A Trihemimeris is a group of three half feet, 
i.e. a foot and a half; a Penthemimeris, of two and a half; a Hephthe- 
mimeris, of three and a half; etc. 
  
1 Sometimes called Choree. 
2 Most feet of four syllables are only compounds of dissylabie feet. Thus the 
Diiambus is a double Iambus; the Ditrochee, a double Trochee; the Choriambus, 
a Trochee (Choree) and an Iambus.  
-P-A-G-E-390
374 PROSODY 
722. Metrital Equivalents. — A long syllable may be resolved 
into two short syllables, as equivalent to it in quantity, or two 
short syllables may be contracted into a long syllable. The forms 
thus produced are metrical equivalents of the original feet. 
Nore. — Thus the dactyl becomes a spondee by contracting the two short 
syllables into one long syllable; the spondee becomes a dactyl by resolving 
the second syllable, or an anapaest by resolving the first. Accordingly, the 
dactyl, the spondee, and the anapaest are metrical equivalents. In like 
manner the iambus, the trochee, and the tribrach are metrical equivalents. 
723. In certain kinds of verse admitting irrational time (720, 4), 
spondees, dactyls, and anapaests are shortened so that they have 
approximately the time of a trochee or of an iambus, and thus become 
metrical equivalents of each of these feet. 
1, A spondee used for a trochee is called an Irrational Trochee, and is 
marked — >. 
2. A-spondee used for an iambus is called an Irrational Iambus, and is 
marked > —.

   724. Ictus, or Rhythmic Accent.— As in the pronunciation of a word| 
one or more syllables receive a special stress of voice called accent, so in| 
the pronunciation of a metrical foot one or more syllables have a special 
prominence called Rhythmic Accent, or Ictus. 
1. Feet consisting of both long and short syllables have the ictus uni. 
formly on the long syllables, unless used as equivalents for other feet. 
2. Equivalents take the ictus of the feet for which they are used. 
Nore 1.— Thus the spondee, when used for the dactyl, takes the ictus o: 
the dactyl, i.e. on the first syllable ; but when used for the anapaest, it take: 
the ictus of the anapaest, i.e. on the last syllable. 
Nore 2.— When two short syllables of an equivalent take the place of 
long syllable in the thesis, the ictus is marked upon the first of these sylla 
bles. Thus a tribrach used for an iambus is marked UG U. 
725. Thesis and Arsis.—In every foot the syllable which has thi 
ictus is called the Thesis (putting down), and the rest of the foot i 
called the Arsis (raising).

raising and putting down the foot in marching or in beating time. Thus th

726. Rhythmic Series.— A group of feet forming a single rhythmic 
unit by the predominance of one ictus over the rest is called a Rhythmic 
Series, or Colon. 
1. A Rhythmic Series may consist of two, three, four, five, or six feet, 
but never of more than six. F 
727. Verses. — A verse consists of a single rhythmic series, or 
of a group of two or three series so united as to form one distinct 
and separate whole, usually written as a single line of poetry. It 
has one characteristic or fundamental foot, which determines the 
ictus for the whole verse. 
Nore 1.— Thus every dactylic verse has the ictus on the first syllable of 
each foot, because the Dactyl has the ictus on that syllable. 
Nor 2.— A verse consisting of a single rhythmic series is called Mono- 
colon; of two, Dicolon; of three, Tricolon. 
Nore 3. —Two verses sometime unite and form a compound verse (746). 
728. Caesura or Caesural Pause.— Most Latin verses are divided 
metrically into two nearly equal parts, each of which forms a rhythmic 
series. The pause, however slight, which separates these parts is called 
1. A Caesura,! or a Caesural Pause, when it occurs within a foot (736). 
2. A Diaeresis, when it occurs at the end of a foot (736, 2 and 3). 
Norr 1.— Some verses consist of three parts thus separated by caesura or 
diaeresis. 
Nore 2.—The term caesura is often made to include both the Caesura 
proper and the Diaeresis. The chief pause in the line is often termed the 
Principal Caesura or simply the Caesura. 
729. The full metrical name of a verse consists of three parts. The 
first designates the characteristic foot, the second gives the number of 
feet or measures, and the third shows whether the verse is complete or 
incomplete. Thus 
1. A Dactylic Hexameter Acatalectic is a dactylic verse of six feet 
(Hexameter), all of which are complete (Acatalectic). 
  
Thesis was the accented part of the foot, and the Arsis the unaccented part. The 
Romans, however, applied the terms to raising and lowering the voice in reading. 
Thus Arsis came to mean the accented part of the foot, and Thesis the unaccented 
part. But most scholars at present deem it advisable to restore the terms to their 
original meaning, though some still prefer to use them in the sense in which the 
Roman grammarians employed them. 
1Caesiira (from caedG, to cut) means a cutting; it cuts or divides the foot 
and the verse into parts.  
-P-A-G-E-392
376 PROSODY 
2. A Trochaic Dimeter Catalectic is a trochaic verse of two measures 
(Dimeter), the last of which is incomplete (Catalectic). 
Nore 1.— A verse with a Dactyl as its characteristic foot is called Dac- 
tylic ; with a Trochee, Trochaic ; with an Iambus, Iambic ; ete. 
Nore 2.— A verse consisting of one measure is called Monometer ; of two, 
Dimeter ; of three, Trimeter ; of four, Tetrameter ; of five, Pentameter ; of 
six, Hexameter. 
Norn 8. — A verse which closes with a Complete measure is called Acata- 
lectic ; with an Incomplete measure, Catalectic ; with an excess of syllables, 
Hypermetrical. 
Nore 4.—The term Acatalectic is often omitted, as a verse may be 
assumed to be complete unless the opposite is stated. 
Nors 5. —A Catalectic verse is said to be Catalectic in syllabam, in disyl- 
labum, in trisyllabum, according as the incomplete foot has one, two, or 
three syllables. 
Nore 6. — Verses are sometimes briefly designated by the number of feet 
or measures which they contain. Thus, Hexameter (verse of six measures) 
sometimes designates the Dactylic Hexameter Acatalectic, and Senarius 
(verse of six feet), the Iambic Trimeter Acatalectic. 
3. In reading catalectic verses, a pause is introduced in place of the 
lacking syllable or syllables. 
4. A Pause or Rest equal to a short syllable is marked A; a Pause 
equal to a long syllable is marked 7. 
730. Verses and stanzas are often designated by names derived from 
celebrated poets. Thus Alcaic is derived from Alcaeus; Archilochian, 
from Archilochus; Sapphic, from Sappho; Glyconic from Glycon, ete. 
Norr. — Verses sometimes receive a name from the kind of subjects to 
which they are applied: as Heroic, applied to heroic subjects; Paroemiac, 
to proverbs, etc. 
781. A Stanza or Strophe is a combination of two or more verses into 
one metrical whole; see 747, 1, 2, etc. 
Nore. — A stanza of two lines or verses is called a Distich ; of three, a 
Tristich ; of four, a Tetrastich. 
732. Rhythmical Reading.—In reading Latin verse care must be 
taken to preserve the words unbroken, to show the quantity of the sylla- 
bles, and to mark the poetical ictus. 
733. Figures of Prosody.— The ancient poets sometimes allowed 
themselves, in the use of letters and syllables, certain liberties generally 
termed Figures of Prosody.

1. Elision.— A final vowel, a final diphthong, or a final m with the 
preceding vowel, is generally elided? before a word beginning with 
a vowel or with h: 
Monstr"™ horrend™™ informe ingéns. Verg. 
Nore 1.— Final e in the interrogative ne is sometimes dropped before a 
consonant: Pyrrhin’ conniibia servas? Verg. 
Nore 2.—In the early poets, final s before a consonant is often so far 
suppressed that it fails to make position with the following consonant: ex 
omnibus rébus. 
Nore 3.—The elision of a final m with the preceding vowel is sometimes 
called Ecthlipsis or Synaloepha. 
Nore 4. — The elision of a final vowel or diphthong is sometimes called 
Synaloepha, or, if at the end of a line, Synapheia. 
2. Hiatus. — A final vowel or diphthong is sometimes retained before 
-a word beginning with a vowel, especially in the thesis of a foot. It is 
regularly retained in the interjections 6, heu, and pré. 
Norn. — In the arsis, and in early Latin even in the thesis, a final long 
vowel or diphthong is sometimes shortened before a short vowel instead of 
being elided ; see Verg. Aen. 3, 211; 6, 507. 
3. Synizesis.— Two syllables are sometimes contracted into one: 
deinde, idem, lisdem. 
Nore 1. — In the different parts of désum, ee is generally pronounced as 
one syllable: deésse, deést, deerat, etc.; so ei in the verb anteed: an- 
teire, anteirem. 
Nore 2. —I and u before vowels are sometimes used as consonants with 
the sound of y and w. ‘Thus ariete becomes aryete; tenués becomes 
tenwés. 
Nore 8.— In Plautus and Terence, Synizesis is used with great freedom. 
Norn 4.— The contraction of two syllables into one is sometimes called 
Synaeresis. 
4, Dialysis.—In poetry, two syllables usually contracted into one are 
sometimes kept distinct: aurai for aurae, soluendus for solvendus. 
Nore 1, — Dialysis properly means the Resolution of one syllable into 
two, but the Latin poets seldom, if ever, actually make two syllables out of 
one. The examples generally explained by dialysis are only ancient forms, 
used for effect or convenience. 
Nore 2. — Dialysis is sometimes called Diaeresis.

VARIETIES OF VERSE 
Dactylic Hexameter 
734. All Dactylic Verses consist of Dactyls and their metrical 
equivalents, Spondees. The ictus is on the first syllable of every 
foot. 
735. The Dactylic Hexameter’ consists of six feet. The first 
four are either Dactyls or Spondees, the fifth a Dactyl, and the 
sixth a Spondee (720, 5).?. The scheme is,?

1 This is at once the most important and the most ancient of all the Greek and 
Roman meters. The most beautiful and finished Latin Hexameters are found in 
the works of Vergil and Ovid. 
2 The Dactylic Hexameter in Latin is here treated as Acatalectic, as the Latin 
poets seem to have regarded the last foot as a genuine Spondee, thus making the 
measure complete. Some authorities, however, treat the verse as Catalectic, and 
mark the last foot 7 U /\. 
3 In this scheme the sign ’ marks the ictus (724), and __ Wo denotes that the 
original Dactyl, marked _Uw, may become by contraction a Spondee, marked 
_—, ie. that a Spondee may be used for a Dactyl (722). 
4 Expressed in musical characters, this scale is as follows: 
dgelege| seal ae 
A = The notation d ee means that, instead of the original measure d o@; the dgaleee 
    equivalent e | may be used. 
5 The final i of illi is elided ; see 738, 1. 
6 With these lines of Vergil compare the following Hexameters from the Evan- 
geline of Longfellow:
-P-A-G-E-395
  VARIETIES OF VERSE 379 
1. The scheme of dactylic hexameters admits sixteen varieties, produced 
by varying the relative number and arrangement of Dactyls and Spondees. 
2. Effect of Dactyls. — Dactyls produce a rapid movement, and are adapted 
to lively subjects. Spondees produce a slow movement, and are adapted to 
grave subjects. But the best effect is produced in successive lines by variety 
in the number and arrangement of Dactyls and Spondees. 
8. Spondaic Line. - The Hexameter sometimes takes a Spondee in the 
fifth place. It is then called Spondaic, and generally has a Dactyl as its 
fourth foot: 
Cara de- | um subo- | lés mag- | num Iovis | incré-| mentum. Verg. 
Nore. — In Vergil, spondaic lines are used much more sparingly than in 
the earlier poets,! and generally end in words of three or four syllables, as 
in incrémentum above. 
736. Caesura, or Caesural Pause. — The favorite caesural pause of 
the Hexameter is after the thesis or in the arsis of the third foot?: 
Arma- | ti ten- | dunt; || it | clamor et | agmine | factd. Verg. 
Tnfan- | dum, ré- | gina, || iu- | bés reno- | vare do-| lorem. Verg. 
Nore. — In the first line the caesural pause, marked |], is after tendunt, 
after the thesis of the third foot; and in the second line, after régina, in the 
arsis of the third foot. A caesura after the thesis of a foot is termed a Mas- 
culine caesura, while a caesura in the middle of the arsis is termed a Feminine 
caesura.> 
1. The Caesural Pause is sometimes in the fourth foot, and then an addi- 
tional pause is often introduced in the second: 
Crédide- | rim; || vér | illud e- | rat, || vér | magnus a-| gébat. Verg. 
2. Bucolic Diaeresis. — A pause called the Bucolic Diaeresis, because origi- 
nally used in the pastoral poetry of the Greeks, sometimes occurs at the end 
of the fourth foot : 
  
This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it 
Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman ? 
1 A single poem of Catullus, about half as long as a book of the Aeneid, con- 
tains more spondaic lines than all the works of Vergil. 
2 That is, the first rhythmic series ends at this point. This pause is always at 
the end of a word, and may be so very slight as in most cases not to interfere with 
the sense, even if no mark of punctuation is required; but the best verses are so 
constructed that the caesural pause coincides with a pause in the sense. 
8 The Masculine Caesura is also called the Strong or the Syllabic Caesura; the 
Feminine, the Weak or the Trochaic Caesura. Caesuras are often named from 
the place which they occupy in the line. Thus a caesura after the thesis of the 
second foot is called Trihemimeral; after the thesis of the third, Penthemimeral; 
after the thesis of the fourth, Hephthemimeral.
-P-A-G-E-396
    380 PROSODY 
Ingen- | tem cae- | 16 soni- | tum dedit; || inde se- | cfitus. erg. 
Nort. — The Bucolic Diaeresis, or Caesura, though often employed by 
Juvenal, was in general avoided by the best Latin poets, even in treating 
pastoral subjects. Vergil, even in his Bucolics, uses it very sparingly. 
3. A diaeresis at the end of the third foot without any proper caesural 
pause is regarded as a blemish in the verse: 
Pulveru- | lentus e- | quis furit; || omnés | arma re-| quirunt. Verg. 
4, The ending of a word within a foot always produces a caesura. A line 
may therefore have several caesuras, but generally only one of these is marked 
by any perceptible pause : 
Arma vi- | ramque ca- | nd, || Trd- | iae qui | primus ab | Gris. Verg. 
Nore.— Here there is a caesura in every foot except the last, but only one 
of these — that after canG, in the third foot —has the caesural pause. 
5. The caesura, with or without the pause, is an important feature in every 
hexameter. A line without it is prosaic in the extreme: 
Romae | moenia | terruit | impiger | Hannibal |{ armis. Enn. 
Nore 1.—The Penthemimeral caesura has great power to impart melody 
to the verse, but the best effect is produced when it is aided by other caesu- 
ras, as in 4 above. 
Nore 2.— A happy effect is often produced by combining the Hephthe- 
mimeral caesura with the Trihemimeral : 
Inde to- | rd || pater | Aené- | as |] sic | Orsus ab | altd.  Verg. 
737. The ictus often falls upon unaccented syllables, especially in the 
third foot, but in the fifth and sixth feet it generally falls upon accented 
syllables; see examples under 735. 
738. The last word of the hexameter is generally either a dissyllable 
or a trisyllable. 
Nore 1.— Two monosyllables at the end of a line are not particularly 
objectionable, and sometimes even produce a happy effect : 
Praecipi- | tant cii- | rae, || tur- | bataque | fiinere | méns est. Verg. 
Nore 2.—In Vergil, twenty-one lines, apparently hypermetrical (729, 
note 3), are supposed to elide a final vowel or a final em or um before the 
initial vowel of the next line; see Aen. 1, 882; Geor. 1, 295.

Other Dactylic Verses 
739. Dactylic Pentameter.1— The Dactylic Pentameter consists of two 
Dactylic Trimeters — the first syncopated or catalectic, the second cata- 
lectic — separated by a diaeresis. The Spondee may take the place of 
the Dactyl in the first part, but not in the second: 
LIOILZTOIZAN ZVI Zu IGA, or 
AG | ere itl Ala | Ne 
Admoni- | tii coe- | pi {| fortior | esse tu- | 6. Ovid. 
1. Elegiac Distich.— The Elegiac Distich consists of the Hexameter 
followed by the Pentameter : 
Sémise- | pulta vi- | rum || cur- | vis feri- | untur a- | ratris 
Ossa, ru- | ind- | sas || occulit | herba do-| mis. Ovid. 
Nors. — Elegiac composition should be characterized by grace and ele- 
ganee. Both members of the distich should be constructed in accordance 
with the most rigid rules of meter, and the sense should be complete at the 
end of the couplet. Oyid and Tibullus furnish us the best specimens of this 
style of composition. 
2. The Dactylic Tetrameter is identical with the last four feet of the 
hexameter : Bs ° 
Ibimus | 6 soci- | i, comi- | tésque. Hor. 
Nors. — In compound verses, as in the Greater Archilochian, the tetram- 
eter in composition with other meters has a Dactyl in the fourth place ; 
see 745, 10. 
3. The Dactylic Trimeter Catalectic, also known as the Lesser Archilo- 
chian, is identical with the second half ofthe dactylic pentameter : 
Arbori- | busque co- | mae. Hor. 
  
1 The name Pentameter is founded on the ancient division of the line into five 
feet; the first and second being Dactyls or Spondees, the third a Spondee, the 
fourth and fifth Anapaests. 
2 In musical characters :

Trochaic Verse 
740. The Trochaic Dipody, the unit of measure in trochaic verse, 
consists of two trochees, the second of which is sometimes irrational 
(720, 4), i.e. it sometimes has the form of a Spondee with the time 
of a Trochee. The first foot has a heavier ictus than the second:

Nore 1.—By the ordinary law of equivalents a Tribrach @ U U may take 
the place of the Trochee 7 U, and an apparent Anapaest © WU > the place 
of the irrational Trochee 7 >.1 In proper names a cyclic Dactyl Sou 
or 7 Ww (728, 3) may occur in either foot. 
Nore 2.— In Dactylic verse the unit of measure is a foot, but in Trochaic, 
Iambic, and Anapaestic verses it is a Dipody, or pair of feet. 
Nore 3.—A syllable called Anacrusis (upward beat) is sometimes pre 
fixed to a trochaic verse. It is separated from the following measure by 
the mark :. 
741. The Trochaic Dimeter Catalectic consists of two Trochaic Dipo 
dies with the last foot incomplete. In Horace it admits no equivalents 
and has the following scheme : |

Aleaic stanza is a Trochaic Dimeter with Anacrusis:

2. The Trochaic Tetrameter Catalectic, or Septenarius, consists of four 
Trochaic Dipodies with the last foot incomplete. There is a diaeresis at 
the end of the fourth foot, and in the best poets the incomplete dipody 
admits no equivalents:

1 Thus in the second foot of a trochaic dipody the poet may use a Trochee, a 
Tribrach, a Spondee, or an Anapaest; but the Spondee and the Anapaest are 
pronounced in the same time, approximately, as the Trochee or the Tribrach,

Nore 2.—Pherecratic is the technical term applied to the regular Logaoe- 
dic Tripody. It is called the First or Second Pherecratic, according as its 
Dactyl occupies the first or the second place in the verse. In each form it 
may be Acatalectic or Catalectic :

In Logaoedic verse the term Basis or Base, marked x, is sometimes applied 
to the foot or feet which precede the Cyclic Dactyl. Thus, in the Second 
Pherecratic, the first foot __ > is the base.

Norg 1.— Glyconic is the technical term applied to the regular Logaoedic 
Tetrapody. It is called the First, Second, or Third Glyconic, according as 
its dactyl occupies the first, second, or third place in the verse. In each 
form it may be either acatalectic or catalectic. 
Norg 2.— The Second Glyconic sometimes has Syncope in the third foot.

pound. With the first explanation, the Dactyls are cyclic and the Spondees 
have irrational time ; with the second explanation, the first member of the 
verse has the Dactyl as its characteristic foot and the second member the 
Trochee ; see 727, note 3.

Harly Latin Rhythms 
748. 1. Certain religious formulas, carmina, which have been preserved 
among the earliest remains of the Latin language, are believed to show a 
rhythmical structure mainly accentual. Each rhythmic series appears to 
contain four theses. An arsis is often suppressed, and in that case a thesis 
is protracted to compensate for the omission. An example of these carmina 
is Cato, Dé Ré Riistica, 132: 
Nippitér Dapiilis | quéd ttbt fierf | opdrtet fn démé | 
familia méa | culignam vini dapi, ete. 
  Nore. — These carmina are chiefly prayers, imprecations, and sacred songs.

Saturnian Verse 
2. The Saturnian verse is employed in some of the earliest remains of 
Latin literature, but its nature is still in dispute. According to one theory 
it is purely accentual, with trochaic rhythm. The verse is divided into two 
halves by a diaeresis. The first half verse has three theses; the second 
usually three, but sometimes only two, and in the latter case it is usually 
preceded by an anacrusis: 
Débunt mélum Metélli || Naévié poétae. 
Prim® incédit Céreris || Prosérpina pier. Naevius. 
Nore 1.—In the early specimens of this meter hiatus is common, but in the 
later literary Saturnians it occurs chiefly at the diaeresis. 
Norr 2.— There is usually one unaccented syllable between every two ac- 
cented syllables, but in the literary Saturnians there are regularly two unac- 
cented syllables between the second and third theses. 
3. According to the quantitative theory held by some scholars, the 
Saturnian is a trochaic verse of six feet, with anacrusis. Each thesis may 
be a long syllable or two shorts; each arsis may be a long syllable, two 
shorts, or a single short. A short final syllable is often lengthened under 
the ictus, and an arsis is frequently suppressed: 
Dabiint malim Metélli || Naévié poétae. 
Nocti Troifd exfbant || cépitibfis opértis. Naevius. 
Nore 1.— The principal pause is usually after the fourth arsis, but sometimes 
after the third thesis. Hiatus is common, but, in strictly constructed Saturnians, 
occurs chiefly at the end of the first rhythmic series. 
Nore 2.—There are many modified forms of both the accentual and quanti- 
tative theories of the Saturnian.

APPENDIX 
HIDDEN QUANTITY 
749. On the natural quantity! of vowels before two consonants or a 
double consonant, observe 
I. That vowels are long before ns, nf, gn,? and before the inceptive 
endings sc6 and scor: 
Conscius, consul, inscribd, insula, amans, audiéns ; conferd, conficid, in- 
félix, Inferd; benignus, magnus, magna, régnum ; gelascd, fldréscé, siléscd, 
edncupiscs, sciscd ; adipiscor. 
  
1Jt is often difficult, and sometimes absolutely impossible, to determine the 
natural quantity of vowels before two consonants, but the subject has of late 
received special attention from orthoepists. An attempt has been made in this 
article to collect the most important results of these labors. The chief sources of 
information upon this subject are (1) ancient inscriptions, (2) Greek transcriptions 
of Latin words, (3) the testimony of ancient grammarians, (4) the modern lan- 
guages, (5) the comic poets, and (6) etymology. 
Valuable information on the subject of hidden quantity will be found in the 
following works:

ber of words, simple and compound, primitive and derivative, which have theso

-P-A-G-E-408
392 APPENDIX 
Nore 1.— Some scholars think that vowels are also long before gm, as they 
are known to be long in ségmen, ségmentum, pigmentum, etc. 
Nore 2.— Some think that vowels before sc6, scor are long only when 
they represent long vowels in the primitives. 
II. That all vowels which represent diphthongs or are the result of 
contraction are long: 
  Existim6, amadssd, audissem, malle, mallem, ndlle, ndllem, tllus, nillus; 
hoérsum (*ho-vorsum), istérsum (*isto-vorsum), quorsum (*quo-vorsum), rir- 
sus (*re-vorsus), sirsum (*sub-vorsum). 
III. That the long vowels of primitives are retained in derivatives: 
Cras-tinus, fas-tus, flds-culus, idis-tus, itis-titia, matri-monium, ds-culum, 
paliis-ter, ras-trum, rds-trum, riis-ticus. 
IV. That compounds retain the long vowels of their members: 
Dé-diixi, dé-réctus, ex-Actus, di-stingud, fratri-cida, mitri-cida, vén-dd, 
introrsum (*intrd-vorsum), prérsus, prérsum (*prd-vorsus, *prd-vorsum). 
V. That vowels are long in the ending of the Nominative singular of 
nouns and adjectives which increase long in the Genitive: 
Léx, lix, pax, plébs, réx, vox. 
VI. In verbs the long stem vowel of the Present is retained in all the 
principal parts: 
arded ardére arsi arsum 
coms comere compsi comptum 
figd figere fixi fixum 
nibs niibere nupsi niptum 
pascd pascere pavi pastum 
scribd scribere scripsi scriptum 
samo siimere stimpsi simptum 
vivo vivere vixi victum. 
1. Note the following exceptions : 
dicd dicere dixi dictum 
dics diicere diixi ductum 
céds cédere cessi cessum. 
ard tirere ussi tstum 
  
endings, and also in view of the fact that still other words are known to have 
long vowels before gn, I concur in the view of those eminent orthoepists who 
think it safe to treat all vowels as long before gn. The practical advantage 
of uniformity in the treatment of vowels in this situation is too obvious to need 
remark.

FIGURES OF SPEECH 
750. The principal Figures of Etymology are 
1. Aphaeresis, the taking of one or more letters from the beginning of a 
word. 
2. Syncope, the taking of one or more letters from the middle of a word. 
3. Apocope, the taking of one or more letters from the end of a word. 
4, Epenthesis, the insertion of one or more letters in a word, 
5. Metathesis, the transposition of letters. 
6. See also Figures of Prosody, 788. 
751. The principal Figures of Syntax are 
1. Ellipsis, the omission of one or more words of a sentence : 
Habitabat ad Iovis (sc. templum), he dwelt near the temple of Jupiter; 
Liv. 1, 41. 
Nor 1.— Aposiopesis is an ellipsis which for rhetorical effect leaves the 
sentence unfinished ; 
Quis ego . . . sed motds praestat componere fluctiis, whom I... but it

a writer of plays. It embraces about eight centuries, from 250 B.c. to 
550 A.p., and it may be conveniently divided into five periods. The 
following are a few representative writers of these periods:

ROMAN CALENDAR 
754. The Julian Calendar of the Romans is the basis of our own, and 
is identical with it in the number of months in the year and in the num- 
ber of days in the months, but it has the following peculiarities : 
I, The days are not numbered from the beginning of the month, as with 
us, but from three different points in the month: 
1. From the Calends, the first of each month. 
2. From the Nones, the jifth —but the seventh in March, May, July, and 
October. 
3. From the Ides, the thirteenth —but the jifteenth in March, May, July, 
and October. 
II. From these three points the days are numbered, not forward, but 
backward. 
Nore. — Hence, after the Ides of each month, the days are numbered 
from the Calends of the following month. 
Ill. In numbering backward from each of these points, the day before 
each is denoted by pridié Kalendas, NonAs, etc.; the second before each 
by dié tertid (not secundd) ante Kalendas, etc.; the third, by dié quarté, 
ete.; and so on through the month. 
1, In dates the name of the month is added in the form of an adjective in 
agreement with Kalendas, N6nas, etc.; as dié quart6 ante Nonas Ianua-
-P-A-G-E-415
  
ROMAN CALENDAR 399 
rias, often shortened to quart6 ante N6nas Ian. or IV. ante N6nas Ian., 
or without ante, as IV. N6nas Ian., the second of January. 
2. Ante diem is common, instead of dié... ante; as ante diem quar- 
tum N6nfs Ian. for dié quart6 ante N6nas Ian. 
3. The expressions ante diem Kal., etc., pridié Kal., etc., are often 
used as indeclinable nouns with a preposition; as ex ante diem V. Idis 
Oct., from the 11th of Oct.; ad pridié NoOnas Maias, till the 6th of May.

1 To the Calends, Nones, ete., the name of the month must of course be added. 
Before N5nas, Idiis, etc., ante is sometimes used and sometimes omitted (754, 
Til. 1). 
2 The Calends of the following month are of course meant; the 16th of March, 
for instance, is XVII. Kalendas Arrilés. 
8 The inclosed forms apply to leap year.

Nore 1,—The table will furnish the learner with the English expression 
for any Latin date, or the Latin expression for any English date. 
Nore 2. —In leap year the 24th and the 25th of February are both called 
the sixth before the Calends of March, — VI. Kal. Mart. The days before 
the 24th are numbered as if the month contained only twenty-eight days, 
but the days after the 25th are numbered regularly for a month of twenty- 
nine days, —V., IV., III. Kal. Mart., and pridié Kal. Mart. 
756. The Roman day, from sunrise to sunset, and the night, from 
sunset to sunrise, were each divided into twelve hours. 
1. The night was also divided into four watches of three Roman hours each, 
2. The hour, being uniformly one twelfth of the day or of the night, of 
course varied in length with the length of the day or night at different seasons 
of the year. 
ROMAN MONEY 
757. The principal Roman coins were the 4s, of copper; the séster- 
tius, quinarius, dénarius, of silver; and the aureus, of gold. Their 
value in the Augustan period may be approximately given as follows : 
AS te ee a oe ee CODES

@uinsrius 2s SPI na ce a Oo ne 
PDD SUS) el Ss ce i sy) eR oO ee 
PANIPOUS s0 5 48 Gp gence eh oak 2 ee OCOD 
1. The as contained originally a pound of copper, but it was dimin- 
- ished, from time to time, till at last it contained only one twenty-fourth 
of a pound. 
2. In all sums of money the common unit of computation was the séstez- 
tius, also called nummus. 
Norr 1.— The units, tens, and hundreds are denoted by séstertii with the 
proper cardinals: viginti séstertii, 20 sesterces. 
Norr 2.— One thousand sesterces are denoted by mille séstertii or mille 
séstertium. 
Nore 3.— In sums less than 1,000,000 sesterces, the thousands are denoted 
either by milia séstertium (genitive plural) or by séstertia: duo milia 
séstertium or bina séstertia. 
Nore 4,—In sums containing one or more millions of sesterces, séster- 
tium with the value of 100,000 sesterces is used with the proper numerad 
adverb, deciés, viciés, etc.: deciés séstertium, 7,000,000 (10 x 100,000) 
sesterces.

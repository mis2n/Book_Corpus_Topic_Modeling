PREFACE. 
Tuat the most effective teaching is impossible without 
an acquaintance with the elementary principles of Psy- 
chology, is no longer a debated question. Fortunately 
there are many who are “born teachers.” Even ¢hey are 
more successful when to a “certain instinct for teaching ” 
they have added a knowledge of Psychology. Still more 
helpful to a genuine success is a knowledge of the Mind 
to the plodding rank and file, that large body of earnest 
men and women teachers whose really splendid equipment 
for their profession is to be credited to unremitting hard 
work inspired by an honest ambition to win success, and a 
sturdy determination to avail themselves of every approved 
resource. 
This book has been written principally for the special 
benefit of that large number of progressive young teachers 
who have not enjoyed the benefits of a college education, 
but who nevertheless are striving..without the aid of an 
instructor to make their work‘tational and therefore more 
efficient by basing it on a knowledge of the Mind. The 
division of the subject matter into “Lessons,” while ad- 
mirably adapting the book to the special requirements of 
teachers’ reading circles, was particularly intended by the 
author to supply the need of a practicable text-book for 
m

iv PREFACE. 
classes in Psychology. Having embodied in these pages 
the experience of many years in teaching Psychology not 
only to teachers but also to pupils in the schools, the 
author believes that he has provided a c/assbook that the 
teacher may place with confidence in the hands of his 
pupils, and the superintendent or Normal School instructor 
in the hands of his training classes. It is hoped that the 
“ Questions” following each Lesson will enhance its help- 
fulness both to the teacher and the student. 
The author ventures to hope that the emphasis laid 
‘upon the limitations of Physiological Psychology and upon 
education as a preparation for rational living; above all, 
that his constant effort to keep the essential difficulties of 
the subject in such full view as to prevent the student from 
mistaking his easy mastery of this elementary book for a 
real mastery of the science of which the book treats —are 
essential features which will be commended. 
The object of the author throughout has been to call 
the attention of his readers to important mental facts in 
such a way as to set them to observing their own minds 
and the minds of their pupils, in order to see for them- 
selves the usefulness of the facts and the experience so 
gained, their application to the daily work of teaching, and 
their inestimable value as an added factor toward success, 
“ Profoundly convinced as he is of the importance of a 
knowledge of Psychology to the teacher, he is quite as 
strongly convinced that the only really fruitful knowledge 
of Psychology which the teacher will ever gain, he will 
derive from a study of his own mind and the minds of the ‘ 
people with whom he comes in contact, and that books 
about Psychology are useful chiefly as they give sugges- 
tions in this direction.” In other words, the aim of the
-P-A-G-E-5
PREFACE. v 
author has been to act the part of a guide in a strange 
city—to tell his readers where to look to find valuable 
truths. If he succeeds in stimulating them to become 
diligent students of their own minds and the minds of 
their pupils, he will be more than satisfied. / 
The author wishes to make acknowledgment to his col- 
leagues, Dr. Bleile and Mr. Wissler, for suggestions relating 
to the chapters on Physiological Psychology.

      GORDY’S NEW PSYCHOLOGY. \ 
LESSON I. 
THE BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY TO THE TEACHER. 
WE all believe that it is worth while to study a great 
many things of which we do not expect to make any practi- 
caluse. You believe, for example, that it is a good thing to 
study algebra and geometry, not because you think the 
knowledge of them is likely to be useful to you — unless 
you should be called upon to teach them — but because 
you think the study of them will develop your mind. 
Reasons for Studying. Psychology. — Probably that is 
one of the reasons why you wish to study Psychology. 
And it certainly is a good reason for studying it. Few 
subjects are better calculated to develop the power of 
thinking than Psychology.. You know that the way to 
develop any power of the mind is to use it, and it is quite 
impossible to make any headway in studying Psychology 
without thinking. That is the reason why it is so hard. 
Develops Power of Thought.— When any one makes. 
an assertion about your mind —and. that is what human 
. 1

A de > 
BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
  "Psychology consists of, assertions about -your mind and the 
minds) of all Srhthan beings — it is often, indeed generally, 
7 Feipossible to realize what i it means without thinking. Thus, 
>. suppose I say that,a: mental fact is known directly to but 
-Yone person, and. ‘that one the person experiencing it. In 
‘otdér to realize what that means, you have to look into 
your own mind for an example of a mental fact. You 
recall the oft-repeated assertion, no one knows what any 
one thinks but himself, and you realize that a thought is 
a mental fact known to but one person directly, and that 
one the person experiencing it. But in order to know 
what other facts are mental facts, you must think long 
and carefully, until you have made up your mind just what 
facts are known to but one person directly, and that one 
_” the-person experiencing them. . 
Even when you can understand an assertion that any 
one makes about your mind without looking into your own 
mind, it is generally necessary for you to do so before you 
can decide intelligently whether or not it is true. If any 
one says that you can not get the continuous attention of 
your pupils without asking questions, or without giving 
them some other motive for attending besides interest, 
that statement can be understood without special effort. 
But in order to determine whether or not it is true, you 
must look into your own mind. You must ask yourself 
whether any one can keep your attention for a half or . 
three-quarters of an hour simply by being-interesting. If 
you set about answering it in the right ‘way, you will think 
until you recall some speaker who never asked you ques- 
tions, or did anything except try to interest you to keep 
your attention, but who was interesting; then I am sure 
you will remember that when he was speaking your ming

PRACTICAL REASONS. ‘ 3. 
wandered much more than it would have done if you had 
known that, when he had finished, he would question you 
about what he was saying. You will remember that you 
often allowed your mind to dwell on interesting points that 
he raised, to the exclusion of what he said directly after. 
For these two reasons—-(1) because you can not under- 
stand most of the assertions in Psychology without think- 
ing; and (2) because, even when you understand them, 
you can not tell without thinking whether or not they 
are true—I know of no subject better calculated to make - 
a pupil think, and therefore better fitted to develop the 
power of thinking, than Psychology. 
Practical Reasons. — But apart from this, you wish to 
study Psychology for quite practical reasons. As a man 
who intends to be a surveyor studies trigonometry, not 
merely because it will develop his mind, but because of -. 
the use it will be to him, so you study Psychology because 
you think the knowledge of it will make you a better 
teacher. . 
Nature of Teaching. — How will it help you in this 
direction? Before you can answer this question,~ you 
must answer another. What is teaching? People used 
to intimate what they thought of this by saying that a 
teacher “keeps school.” But “keeping school” is not 
teaching. Nor is it to teach to hear recitations. Zo teach 
ts to deal with mind — is to get it to DO something which 
it would not have done apart from the teacher, in order* 
to get it to BECOME something which it would not have: 4 
become apart from him. 
In order to do this intelligently, you plainly need to:
-P-A-G-E-13
4 BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
have as clear an idea as possible of what you wish your 
pupils to become. If your, pupils were everything that 
you wish them to become, you would not undertake to 
teach them. What is it that you wish them to become? 
In what respect do you wish them to change as the result 
of your teaching? That question, the study of Psychology 
will help you to answer; and the more you know about 
Psychology, the more clearly and fully and definitely you 
can answer it. 
Meaning of Development. — Quite likely you think you 
can answer it now. You say you wish your pupils to have 
better developed minds at the end of each day than they 
had at the beginning. But better developed in what 
direction? The North American Indians had remarkable 
powers of observation. They could track an enemy through 
a forest where you could see no trace of a human being. 
‘Will you be content to have your pupils acquire powers 
similar to those possessed. by the North American Indians? 
Is this what you wish them to become? The Chinese 
have remarkable memories. Many educated Chinamen 
remember almost word for word the nine classics compiled 
and edited by Confucius. Do you want your pupils to 
have minds like the Chinese ? . 
I do not, of course, mean to imply that you should not 
aim to cultivate the observing powers of your pupils as 
well as their memories. But the North American Indians 
developed their powers of observation at the expense of 
the higher powers of their minds, and the Chinese their 
mechanical memory in the same costly way. And yet 
the Chinese aim at development. It is evident, there- 
fore, that when one says that .the object of education
-P-A-G-E-14
NECESSITY OF «= DEFINITE AIM. 5 
is development, he has not expressed a very definite idea. 
The question is, What kind of development? and that 
question Psychology will help us answer. 
Necessity of a Definite Aim.— So you see that when 
you say you want to help your pupils develop their minds, 
you have by no means proved that you know precisely 
what, as an intelligent teacher, you ought to aim at. And 
unless we know what to aim at, we can not hope’ to have 
success. Do you think an architect could build a beauti- 
ful house if he began to build it and worked at it from 
day to day without having in his mind, so to speak, the 
house he was trying to build? Well, if a carpenter must 
have a picture in his mind-of the kind .of house he wishes 
to build in order to build it, how can we hope to succeed 
in moulding and forming the minds of our pupils in an 4 
intelligent way, unless we have the clearest ideas of what 
we wish them to become? 
Need of a Criterion of Knowledge. — But at any rate, 
perhaps you think you are clear as to one thing in which 
you wish your pupils to change; you wish them to become 
less ignorant — you wish them to know more. But to 
know more of what? We have not got very far when we 
say that we wish to help our pupils to acquire knowledge, _ 
unless we have made up our minds as to what knowledge 
is worth acquiring. There is a good deal of history in the 
text-books which is not worth learning, and a good deal 
out of them which is in the highest degree important, and 
the same is true of the other subjects we teach. How are 
we to make up our minds what knowledge is worth acquir- 
ing? The study of Psychology will help us do that. It
-P-A-G-E-15
6 BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
-will help us see the effect which the acquiring of this or 
that piece of knowledge will have on the mind, and in this 
way enable us to estimate its worth. 
Here again it is evident that it is quite impossible to 
succeed in teaching unless in some way we are able to 
decide intelligently what we ought to get our pupils to 
learn. Until we are able to decide that, we can; in the 
first place, aim only to get them to learn everything in the 
text-book. This is bad for two reasons: in the first place, 
text-books are sometimes written by men who know su 
little of the subject that they can not tell what is important 
and what is not important ; and in the second place, intel- 
ligent men put many things in text-books, not that students 
may learn them, but that they may be able to refer to 
them if they have occasion to use them. No one but a 
fool would commit to memory a railroad guide. And yet 
railroad guides are very useful; but when any one has 
occasion for them, he goes to them. He remembers what 
he finds there just as long as he wants it, and then does 
- not trouble his head with it any longer. Now, intelligent 
men put many such facts in the books they write — facts 
which they do not expect any dne to learn, but to which 
they think persons may sometimes have occasion to refer. 
For these two reasons, it is very unfortunate for a teacher 
to have to rely entirely upon his text-books in deciding 
what to teach. 
The study of Psychology, then, will help us see what we 
ought to aim at. It will help us see the kind of develop- 
ment we ought to try to help them get, and the kind of 
knowledge we ought to try to impart.

LESSON II. 
THE BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY TO THE TEACHER, 
(Continued.) 
Conditions of Success.—To succeed well in any diffi- 
cult undertaking, three things are necessary: (1) one 
must see clearly the thing to be done; (2) he must have 
a clear idea of the best means of doing it; and (3) he 
must have a strong motive for doing it well. Hein whom 
these conditions meet most perfectly — who sees most 
clearly the thing to be done, who has the clearest percep- 
tion of the best means of doing it, who has the strongest 
motive for making strenuous efforts to do it —is the per- 
son most likely to succeed in any difficult undertaking. 
The study of Psychology can not be urged on the 
ground that it is likely to do much toward making the 
teacher interested in his work, and more willing, therefore, 
to work hard in order to do it well. It is not, indeed, 
without effect in this direction. The work of teachers 
who make no study of mind is likely to be mechanical, 
while the work of teachers who base their efforts on a 
knowledge of mind is rational, And mechanical work is 
uninteresting, unattractive — fit only for machines. Any- 
thing, therefore, which tends to make a teacher’s work 
rational certainly tends to make it interesting. This was 
what Fitch meant when he called teaching the noblest of 
afts and the sorriest of trades. Practiced mechanically, 
8
-P-A-G-E-18
PSYCHOLOGY AND TEACHING, 9 
it is indeed a trade, and a sorry one at that; practiced 
rationally — practiced by One who realizes that he is deal- 
ing with mind, and who uses this method or that, not 
because some one else has used it, but because his knowl- 
edge of mind leads him to believe that a given method is 
the best —- teaching is the noblest of arts. 
Psychology and Teaching. — But while the study of 
Psychology is of some benefit to the teacher in that it 
tends to give him more interest in his work, I do not urge 
it on this ground. It is for the other two reasons, (1) be- 
cause of the clearness which it is fitted to give to the aim of 
the intelligent teacher, and (2) because of the light it throws 
on the best methods of realizing that aim, that I believe 
no teacher who is ambitious to succeed should neglect to 
study those phases of Psychology that bear on education. 
In the last lesson I tried to show what the study ‘of 
Psychology can do for us in the first direction. I tried to 
show that when we are able to say that our aim is to bring 
about the development of our pupils, we have not got very 
far unless we have made up our minds as to the value, so 
to speak, of the various faculties of the mind — that unless 
we know the worth of the observing powers, and of the 
various kinds of memory, imagination, and reasoning, we 
can not proceed intelligently in training them. In like 
manner, unless we have made up our minds as to “ what 
knowledge is of most worth,” I tried to. show that it is of 
little use to be able to say that we wish to induce our 
pupils to acquire knowledge. I tried further to show that : 
Psychology, by helping us discover the relation of the 
various powers of the mind to each ‘other, will help us 
determine the kind of development we ought to aim at;
-P-A-G-E-19
10 BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
and also, that by helping us see the effect of the various 
kinds of knowledge upon the mind, it will help us decide 
“what knowledge is of most worth.” 
But not only will the study of Psychology tend to give 
clearness and definiteness to our aim, it will tend quite as 
strongly to show what we must do to realize that aim. 
Methods Used in Dealing with Objects in the Mate- 
rial World.—In dealing with mind we must use the same 
kinds of methods which we use when we deal with objects 
in the material world. What we accomplish in the mate- 
rial world we accomplish by putting objects where they 
will be subject to new influences, so that the forces of 
nature may do the work we wish to have done. Mortar 
in one place and bricks in another do nothing to make the 
walls of a house, but place the bricks on a strong founda- 
tion, and put the mortar between them, and you have a 
strong wall. All you have done, you will note, is to move 
the bricks and mortar so as to put them in new positions 
and make them subject to new influences, so that the 
forces of nature may do the desired work. Heat water 
to the boiling-point, and it will change into steam; and if 
you leave it where it can escape, nothing will come of it. 
But move the water into a confined place, so that the 
steam can not escape, and then you can make it drive 
immense palaces across the sea, or pull huge trains across 
the continent. Every invention which has ever been made 
is simply a way of moving things into new positions where 
they are subject to new influences, so that the forces of 
nature may do the desired work. AW the force that ts 
employed in nature cx fis in nature. All that man 
accomplishes he accomplishes by making the forces of

METHODS IN DEALING WITH THE MIND. It 
nature work under different circumstances, and by turn 
ing them into different channels from those in which they 
would have worked apart from him. It is by making 
nature our servant that we have made such wonderful 
progress in material civilization in the nineteenth century. 
How is it that we have been able to make nature work for 
us in such wonderful ways? Simply by knowing the laws 
of nature. Knowing the laws of nature, we have been 
able, so to speak, to foresee what she would do under cer- 
tain circumstances, and the result is the steam-engine, the 
telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, and all the other 
inventions which minister to our well-being. 
w 
Methods to be Used in Dealing with the Mind.—In 
dealing with mind we must work in the same way. As 
everything which happens in nature is due to the laws of 
nature, so everything which happens in mind is due to the 
laws of mind. As our power in nature depends upon the 
skill with which we get her to work for us, so our power 
in dealing with mind depends upon our ability to get it so 
to act that the results we desire will follow. As success 
in dealing with nature consists in supplying the conditions 
which make it possible for nature to do the desired work, 
so success in dealing with the mind consists in supplying 
the conditions which make it possible for the mind to do 
the work we want it todo. And as the better we know the 
laws of nature (in other words, the better we know the con- 
ditions under which nature will produce this or that result) 
the better we can supply those conditions; so the better 
we know the laws of the mind (in other words, the better 
we know the conditions under which the mind will do this 
or that, the better we can supply these conditions. The
-P-A-G-E-21
12 BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
aim of the teacher being a certain kind of development, 
and the communication of a certain kind of knowledge, 
evidently the more he knows of the conditions under 
which the mind develops, and the conditions under which 
it acquires knowledge, the better he can supply them. 
Difference in this Respect between Natural Agent 
and the Mind.— “But is there no difference,” you may 
ask, “between a natural agent and the human mind in 
this regard? May we say of the human mind, as we may 
of a natural agent, that it will always do all the work it 
can under the given condition?” There is an important 
ifference, but it makes for rather than against the skillful 
teacher. A natural agent can not be flattered, bribed, or 
cajoled ; it'takes no account of intentions or motives. In 
dealing with a natural agent, the one single, simple, alJ 
determining question is, Are the conditions fulfilled? If 
they are fulfilled, the effect will follow; if they are not 
fulfilled, the effect will not follow. But the case is dif- 
- ferent with the human mind. When we have put the 
mind under the right influences, it has a watural tendency 
to the kind of activity we’ wish to occasion ; but this ten- 
dency may be increased or diminished by purely personal 
relations. A teacher who adapts the subject of instruction 
to the mental condition of his pupil creates a ¢endency in 
the mind of his pupil to follow his instruction with interest. 
But if by impatience, ill-humor, or sarcastic remarks the 
teacher has excited the antagonism of the pupil, the pupil 
resists the tendency ; he is unwilling to do what he knows 
his teacher desires. If, on the other hand, the teacher by 
patience and industry and kindness has gained the regard 
of his pupil, the pupil exerts himself to attend to the sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  WHY PUPILS DO NOT LEARN. 13 
ject. In this way it happens that personal qualities may 
atone, to some extent, for lack of skill on the part of the 
teacher. 
Do you ask if a corresponding increase in the teacher’s 
knowledge of mind, and a corresponding increase in his 
skill in basing his work on that knowledge. would enable 
him to work such miracles in the minds of his pupils as 
inventors have worked in nature through their knowledge 
of the laws of nature? I can not, of course, answer such 
a question, Noone can. But in the School of the Far-off 
Future—- when no teacher will be allowed to enter a 
school-room who has not made a thorough study of educa- 
tional Psychology, and who has not proved to the entire«. 
satisfaction of competent judges his ability to apply what 
he has learned — in that school there will be no dull, list- 
‘less, inattentive pupils. There will be no boys who leave 
school because they do not like it. There will be no 
pupils who hate books. 
Why Pupils do not Learn. — As a child learns not 
-only rapidly but with intense pleasure from the time of his 
birth to the time he starts to school simply because the 
activities in which he spontaneously engages are fitted to 
his state of development, so he will continue to learn 
rapidly and with intense pleasure after he starts to school 
of the work he is set to doing is adapted to his state of 
development. 
Answer of Comenius. — Do you know who Comenius 
was? It was he who said that if our pupils do not learn it 
is our fault. And he was undoubtedly right. If we supplied 
the proper conditions, our pupils would as certainly learn

as a train will move when the engineer turns on the 
steam. 
Answer of Pestalozzi.— Do you know who Pestalozzi 
was? It was he who said that if pupils are inattentive the 
teacher should first look to himself for the reason. He 
also was undoubtedly right. As certainly as a blade of § 
corn will grow and mature if it is treated right —if the 
proper conditions are supplied — so certainly will our 
pupils attend, and think as the result of attending, and § 
develop as the result of thinking, if we supply the proper j 
conditions. 
Can Conditions of Learning Always be Supplied ? — % 
“If we supply the proper conditions.” It is but truth to J 
say that that sometimes is beyond our power under the ¥ 
circumstances in which we are obliged to work. Some 
pupils have so little capacity for a subject that to supply # 
the proper conditions would require an amount of atten- 
tion which the teacher ‘can not possibly give them. It is 
doubtful also if there are not cases in which there is so } 
little capacity for a subject as to make it a waste of time § 
for the pupil to attempt to study it. A case came under 
my own observation of a boy who would spend jive houvs | 
on a spelling lesson, and still miss nine words out of ten, 
I am strongly inclined to the opinion that spelling was an { 
accomplishment which he could not afford to acquire.

BODY AND MIND. 
Connection between Body and Mind. — We all know 
that there is an intimate connection between body and 
‘mind. We know that when our eyes are open we see, 
and when they are closed, we do not see; that when our 
hands, or other parts of the body, are in contact with an 
object we. have a sensation of touch, and when they are 
not, we do not.} We know that when we deprive our bodies 
of proper nourishment, as in fasting, we have a headache, 
and the longer we fast, the more incapable we become of 
any kind of mental exertion. We know that any derange- 
ment of the bodily functions produces an immediate effect 
upon the mind. We know that tea and coffee stimulate, 
and that alcoholic liquors intoxicate. Many a student has 
brought upon himself a feeling of bodily exhaustion through 
purely mental labor; or, by a long tramp or some other 
form of prolonged physical exertion, he has produced a 
feeling of mental exhaustion. fin other words, prolonged 
mental labor not only fatigues the mind but the body ; 
prolonged physical labor mot only fatigues the body but 
.the mind. Those are a few of the familiar facts which 
have made it impossible for eny one to doubt that there is 
a very close relation between the body and the mind.

THE BRAIN AND THE MIND. 17 
Opinion of the Greeks as to the Connection of the 
Brain and the Mind. — But it is by no means so evident 
that the brain is the part of the body which is in some 
sort of direct relation with the mind, and that the rest of 
the body influences the mind only through its relation to 
the brain. We shall realize this if we remember that 
though the Greek physician Alcmzon regarded the brain 
as the common meeting-place of the senses, and this 
opinion was accepted by Plato, yet Aristotle, himself the 
son of a doctor, and one of the greatest of the Greek 
philosophers, rejected it. He said that the brain was a 
lump of cold substance, useful as the source of the fiuid 
which lubricates the eyes, but quite unfit to be the organ 
of mind. What is the evidence which has led physiologists 
to conclude that he was mistaken? 
Effect on Consciousness of a Blow on the Head. — It 
is a matter of direct experience that the connection between 
consciousness and the brain is closer than that between 
consciousness and any other part of the body. A blow on 
the head may deprive us of consciousness ; a blow on any 
other part of the body, as a rule, only inflicts pain. It is 
indeed true that a blow on the heart may cause uncon- 
sciousness, But that is because the blow may prevent 
the heart from sending to the brain its proper supply of 
blood. 
The Nerves Compared with Telegraph Wires. — More- 
over, the pain that we feel from a blow on any other part 
of the body depends upon the brain. Cut the nerve that 
connects one of the fingers with the brain, and an injury : 
inflicted upon it makes no impression on consciousness.
-P-A-G-E-27
18 BODY AND MIND. 
The relation’ between the body and the brain may be 
“roughly compared to the relation between a telegraph wire 
and the receiving office. The telegraph wire is important 
because it is the medium through which the messages are 
transmitted to the receiving office. But it is the machinery 
at the receiving office which makes the receipt of messages 
possible. And precisely as no message can be received 
if the telegraph wire.is cut or injured, so no effect is pro- 
duced upon the brain, and therefore none on conscious- 
ness, if the nerves connecting an injured part of the body 
with the brain are injured. 
There is a rough resemblance between the relation of 
consciousness to the brain, and that of the ringing of a 
bell to the striking of its sides by its clapper. Cause 
the bell by any means to swing to and fro so that the 
clapper strikes its sides, and you cause it toring. Affect 
the brain in any way, either by a blow on the head, or 
by increasing or decreasing the quantity of blood that 
‘supplies it, or by changing its quality, and you affect 
consciousness. Pulling the bell-rope only causes the bell 
to ring because it causes the clapper to strike the sides 
of the bell. When we see how closely pain follows upon 
an injury inflicted on any part of the body, we might 
suppose that the bodily injury is the direct cause of the 
consciousness of pain. But when we remember that 
the bodily injury affects consciousness only as the effect 
of the injury is communicated to the brain, we see that it 
is the effect upon the brain that influences consciousness, 
  
The Supply of Blood to the Brain. — This conclusion, 
which facts familiar to all of us render highly probable, 
may be regarded as demonstrated by the conclusions of
-P-A-G-E-28
MOSSO’S TABLE. 19 
science. While the weight of the entire brain is only 
about one forty-second of the weight of the body, it has 
been calculated that the supply of blood used by the brain 
is one eighth of that used by the whole body. How essen- 
tial this supply of blood is, becomes evident if it is in any 
way interfered with. Stop one of the great arteries lead- 
ing to the brain by compression in the neck or in any 
other way; and great disturbances in consciousness at 
once appear, even to the point of its entire cessation. One 
investigator, Dr. Lombard, found that the temperature of 
the head varies rapidly, though slightly, during waking 
hours. By careful measurements with delicate thermo- 
electric apparatus he found that “every cause that attracts 
the attention ——a noise, or the sight of some person or 
other object—produces elevation of temperature. An 
elevation of temperature also occurs under the influence 
of an emotion, or during an interesting reading aloud.”? 
Mosso’s Table. — If it were possible to doubt that this 
rise in temperature is due to an increase in the blood 
supplied to the brain, that possibility would seem to be 
removed by the experiments of an Italian investigator 
named Mosso. He devised a table so accurately balanced 
that a man might recline on it without disturbing its 
balance. He found that its balance was at once destroyed 
by any cause that quickened the activity of the subject’s 
consciousness. A sudden noise, an interesting thought, 
anything that increased the activity of consciousness, would 
cause the head end of the table to sink down as quickly as 
if a weight had been placed upon it.

20 BODY AND MIND. 
Localization of Cerebral Functions. All the argu- 
ments in support of what is called the localization of cerebral 
functions are so many arguments to show that the brain 
is the organ of the mind. These arguments we will con- 
sider in a later chapter. Suffice it here to say that it has 
been proved to the satisfaction of physiologists and psy- 
chologists, not only that the brain is the organ of mind, but 
that particular parts of the brain are connected in a pecu- 
liarly close and intimate way with certain mental activities. 
Evidently every argument in support of this conclusion is 
equally good to show that the brain is the organ of the mind. 
A large number of experiments made upon the lower 
animals prove the same fact. First one part and then 
another of the brain of various lower animals (frogs and 
pigeons, for example) has been removed for the purpose of 
ascertaining what part of the brain is connected with par- 
ticular classes of mental operations. And though the 
phenomena vary with the animal, and with the part of the 
brain removed, to say nothing of the skill of the operator, 
the facts taken together leave no doubt of the special con- 
nection between the brain and the mind, 
The American Crow-bar Case. — For obvious reasons 
such experiments have not been performed upon the 
brains of men, but disease and accident have performed 
them for us. One of the most famous of these experiments 
‘is that which is now known as the American crow-bar case. 
While a young man named Gage was “tamping a blasting | 
charge in a rock with a pointed iron bar, 3 feet 7 inches 
in length, 14 inches in diameter, and weighing 13% Ibs., § 
the charge suddenly exploded. The iron bar, propelled 
with its pointed end first, entered at the left angle of the §

patient’s jaw, and passed clean through the top of his head, 
near the sagittal suture in the frontal region, and was 
picked up at some distance covered with blood and brains. 
The patient was for a moment stunned, but, within an 
hour after the accident, he was able to walk up a long 
flight of stairs and give the surgeon an intelligible account 
of the injury he had sustained. His life naturally was for 
a long time despaired of ; but he ultimately recovered, and 
lived twelve and a half years afterwards. . . . The whole 
track of the bar is included in that region of the brain ~ 
which I have described as the prefrontal region. .. . 
Hear what Dr. Harlow (in a paper read in 1868 before the 
Massachusetts Medical Society) says as to his mental con- 
dition: ‘His contractors, who regarded him as the most 
efficient and capable foreman in their employ previous to 
his injury, considered the change in his mind so marked 
that they could not give him his place again. The equi- 
librium or balance, so to speak, between his intellectual 
faculties and animal propensities seems to have been de- 
stroyed. He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the 
grossest profanity (which was not previously his custom), 
manifesting but little deference to his fellows, impatient of 
restraint or advice when it conflicts with his desires, at 
times pertinaciously obstinate, yet capricious and vacillat- 
ing, devising many plans of future operation, which are no 
sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for others ~~ 
more feasible. A child in his intellectual capacity and 
manifestations, he has the animal passions of a strong man. 
Previously to his injury, though untrained in the schools, 
he possessed a well-balanced mind, and was looked upon 
by the people who knew him as a shrewd, smart business 
man, very energetic and persistent in executing all his
-P-A-G-E-31
22 BODY AND MIND. 
plans of operation. In this regard, his mind was radically 
changed, so decidedly, that his friends and acquaintances 
said he was no longer Gage.’”? 
Impairment of Memory Due to Injury of the Brain. — 
It is a matter of common knowledge that injuries to the 
brain often result in an impairment of memory. Forbes 
Winslow notes a remarkable case of a soldier upon whom 
the operation of trephining had been performed and who 
lost a portion of his brain. The result was that he torgot 
the numbers five and seven, and those only. After a time 
his memory of these numbers was restored. Numerous 
cases ‘are on record of the impairment of memory in con- 
sequence of a violent blow on the head. 
Aphasia. — Very significant as to the dependence of 
mind on brain are the phenomena designated. by the 
general term aphasia. Dr. Bateman says the term is used 
“to designate that condition in which the intelligence is 
unaffected, or at all events but slightly impaired; when 
thoughts are conceived by the patient but he can not 
express himself, either because he has lost the memory of 
words, or because he has lost the memory of the mechan- 
ical process necessary for the pronunciation of these words; 
or because the rupture of the means of communication 
between the gray matter of the brain and the organs, 
whose co-operation is necessary to produce speech, does 
not allow the will to act upon them in a normal manner as 
the ideas are formed, but the means of communication 
with the external world do not exist.”

481, from Ferrier’s Localization of Cerebral Disease.

-P-A-G-E-32
MOTOR APHASIA, 23 
Motor Aphasia. — The foregoing definition, as we shall 
see in a later chapter, covers phenomena widely different 
from each other. A man who can understand what is said 
to him, but who can not talk, is said to suffer from sozor 
aphasia. He knows what he wants to say, but he has 
-lost control of the mechanism of speech. Sufferers from 
another kind of aphasia have perfect control of the mechan- 
ism of speech. They can talk, but they can not under 
stand what is said to them. They can hear, but they can 
not grasp the meaning of what is said to them. 
Now in cases of moter aphasia it has been proved that 
the cause of the difficulty is located in a definitely ascer- 
tained part of the brain. Says Professor James: ‘ When- 
ever a patient dies in such a condition as this and an 
examination of his brain is permitted, it is found that the 
lowest frontal gyrus is the seat of injury.” 
Correspondence between Size and Weight of Brain, 
and Intelligence. — Still another class of facts may be 
pointed out as indicating the closeness of the relation 
between the mind and the brain. Comparative anatomy 
shows that there is a general, though indefinite, corre: 
spondence of the place of an animal in the scale of intel 
ligence, to the size and weight of its brain compared with 
the bulk of its entire body. In other words, as a rule, the 
larger and heavier the brain of an animal in comparison 
with the weight of its entire body, the higher it is in the 
scale of intelligence. As Professor Ladd says, “The law 
itself is confessedly subject to remarkable and unexplained 
exceptions; at best it only holds good in a general way. 
For example, the relative weight of the brain is not 
greatly different in the dolphin, in the baboon, and in

man.” Nevertheless, it may fairly be regarded as adding 
to the evidence which has convinced physiologists and 
psychologists that the brain is the organ of the mind.

LESSON IV. 
THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
In the preceding chapter we have considered the evi- 
dence which seems to prove that the brain is the organ of 
the mind. Let us in this chapter endeavor to get an idea . 
of that wonderful mechanism of which the brain consti- 
tutes the most conspicuous part. Let us try to get an 
idea of the central nervous system. 
We learned in the last lesson that there is a direct con- 
nection between the outside of the body and the brain. If- 
your hand-comes in contact with a hot stove, you quickly 
become aware of it ‘through sensations of touch and of 
pain, There is an equally direct connection between the 
brain and the muscles that move the hand. As soon as 
you become conscious of the sensation of pain you snatch 
your hand away. 
Nerves and Tendons. — If you dissect the body of one 
of the higher animals, you will see some of the machinery 
by means of which such phenomena are brought about. 
You will see numerous white cords which look like tendons 
—those dense white cords in which a muscle terminates, 
and which attach the muscles to the bones of the body. 
But that these white cords are not muscles, is shown ‘by’ 
the fact that many of them are-aot connected with muscles

at all, and those which are, usually enter the central part 
of the muscle, instead of being attached to its end as ten- 
dons usually are. These cerds are nerves. 
_ If you follow them in one direction, they subdivide into 
smaller and smaller branches until they become too small 
to be seen without the aid cf the microscope. If you fol- 
‘low them in the opposite direction, they become larger and 
larger through uniting with similar nerves until they enter 
a much larger mass, whose structure and appearance differ 
widely from that of the nerves which enter it. This mass 
is called a nerve centre. 
Nerve Fibres and Nerve Cells. — Nerves are composed 
of one or more nervous elements called xerve fibres, bound 
together by connective tissue. The chief constituent of 
a nerve centre is nerve cells, Nerve fibres and nerve cells 
differ in density, shape and chemical composition. Fibrous 
nerve matter contains more water than cellular nerve mat- 
ter, and is therefore less dense than the latter. They differ 
in their shape. Fibres are long “thread-like connec- 
tions,” while nerve cells have a great variety of forms. 
« Some are nearly round; others ovoidal, caudate, stellate, 
or shaped like a flask or the blade of a paddle.” Nerve 
fibres and nerve cells differ in size. Nerve fibres vary 
from about zeyp to grboe Of an inch in diameter, while 
nerve cells vary from about g$y to gggp Of an inch. It is 
supposed that there are not less than two and a half mil- 
lions of sensory nerve fibres alone, while man’s entire 
central nervous system is reckoned to have about three 
thousand million nerve cells. 
Nerve fibres are never found apart from nerve cells. 
Indeed, recent investigation has shown that the fibre is an

outgrowth or proiongation of the cell.1 A nerve cell with 
its prolongation into a nerve fibre constitutes the unit of 
the nervous system. The essential element of a nerve 
fibre is called its axis-cylinder. Near the ending of a 
nerve fibre it is the only constituent of the fibre that is

28 THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
Two Functions of the Nervous System.— We may 
regard the nervous system as a mechanism having two 
great functions to perform ; (1) reporting the condition of 
the outside world to the individual, and enabling him to 
controthis-actions accordingly ; and (2) binding the various 
parts of the body into an interdependent whole. ‘ 
The first function we are too familiar with to make 
extended illustration necessary. A person suffering from 
rheumatism, feeling a draught of cold air, gets up and

  closes the window. His nerves report the condition of the 
outside world ; his nerves set in motion the machinery — 
the proper muscles— by means of which he closes the 
window. The one action may be compared with the tele- 
phoning to the fire department of a city that a building in 
a certain part of it is on fire; the other to the sending of 
engines to extinguish the fire. 
The same illustration may be used to illustrate the 
second function of the nervous system, the binding to- 
gether of the various parts of the body into one inter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
FUNCTIONS OF FIBRES AND CELLS. 29 
dependent whole. When a draught of cold air strikes the 
body, apart from the voluntary motion which it may occa- 
sion, its effects may be felt throughout the entire body. 
The heart and. lungs may modify their activity; some of 
the involuntary muscles may contract ; and a shudder may 
run through the entire physical organism, 1 
Martin well says that in common life “the very fre- 
quency of this uniting activity. of the nervous system is 
such that we are apt to entirely overlook it. We do not 
wonder how the sight of pleasant food will; make ‘the 
mouth water and the hand reach out for it; it seems, as 
we say, ‘natural,’ and to need no explanation. But the 
eye itself can excite no desire, cause the secretion of no 
saliva, and the movement of no limb. The whole complex 
result depends on the fact that the eye is united by the 
optic nerve with the brain, and that again by other nerves 
with saliva-forming cells, and with muscular fibres of the 
arm; and through these a change excited by light falling 
into the eye is enabled to produce changes in far-removed 
organs, and excite desire, sensation, and movement.” ? 
Functions of Fibres and Cells. — ‘This general survey 
of the functions of the nervous system enables us to antici- 
pate in an indefinite way the work to be done by the two 
elements of the nervous system. The fibres, or nerves 
composed of fibres, will have as their function to transmit 
stimulations from the surface or outer part of the body to 
the nerve centres, and to transmit impulses from those 
centres to the muscles. The cells, or centres composed 
of cells, will-have as their function to receive the stimula.

tions transmitted by the nerves, and to send impulses 
along the nerves to the muscles. 
Afferent and Efferent Nerves. — The nerves, accord- 
ingly, may be divided into two classes: the first class 
connect some sensitive structure as the skin, the retina, 
the nervous membrane of the stomach, at their peripheral 
termination, with the centre ; the second connect the cen- 
tre with the muscles to which they are attached at their 
péripheral termination. 
The first class are excited to activity by some structure 
at their peripheral termination, and transmit nervous 
action to the centre. They are, therefore, called afferent, 
in-carrying, or centripetal nerves. The second class are 
excited to activity by the nerve centres with which they 
are connected, and transmit nervous excitation to the mus-~ 
_cles with which they are connected at their peripheral 
extremity. They are, therefore, called efferent, out-carry— 
ing, centrifugal, or motor nerves. 
The most important of the afferent nerves for Psychology 
are those which are called sensory nerves, because they 
connect the sense organs — eyes, ears and’ so on—— with 
the“nerve centres. The most important of the motor 
nerves for Psychology are those which connect the nerve 
centres with the “voluntary” muscles—those of the 
hands, arms, legs, eyes, for example. 
Nature of the Sense Organs. The greater part of 
the sense organs consist largely of mechanical contriv— 
ances whose function is to modify the external. stimulus, 
and convey the impulse imparted by it to the nerves of 
sense. 
  
OAR
-P-A-G-E-40
  NATURE OF THE SENSE ORGANS, 3L. 
For example, the nose consists in large part of a 
mechanism for bringing the particles of odorous sub- 
stances in contact with that part of the mucous mem- 
brane of the nose in which the olfactory nerve terminates. 
In order that an object may be smelled, it is not enough 
that an odorous substance be held near the nose. A 
current of air containing particles of the odorous sub- 
stance must be drawn through the nose, and thus brought 
into contact with the terminal fibres of the olfactory ae nerye. 
In like manner the ear consists for the most part of a 
mechanism whose function is to modify the waves of sound, 
and transmit them so modified to the internal ear, in which 
the fibres of the auditory nerve terminate. When the 
vibrations of air reach the tympanum, they have too large 
an amplitude, and too little intensity, to occasion these 
vibrations in the elements of the internal ear, which are 
essential to the excitation of the auditory nerve. The 
tympanum modifies these vibrations so as to adapt them 
to the excitation of the terminal fibres of the auditory 
nerve, and at the same time transmits them to the internal 
ear. 
So likewise, the eye consists in part of an optical instru- 
ment, in part of a sensitive nervous membrane called the 
retina, on which the image resulting fromthe optical 
instrument is formed. The eye, as an optical instrument, 
transmits the stimulations received from light té the 
nervous elements in the retina in which the optic nerye 
terminates. — — 
The nerve..centres with which Psychology i is especially 
interested are those which are found in the encephalon, or 
contents of the-skull, and the spinal cord.
-P-A-G-E-41
320 THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
Gray and White Matter. —- These centres consist of 
masses of gray and white matter. The white matter con- 
sists chiefly of nerve fibres; the gray matter, of nerve cells. 
These cells, as we have seen, have prolongations or out- 
growths called fibres, of which the axis-cylinder is the most 
essential element. After the axis-cylinder leaves the cell, 
it divides into two cr more parts. Some of these parts 
enter the white mass, composed chiefly of nerve fibres, and 
become part of these fibres. Some pass through this white 
mass and unite with the parts into which the axis-cylinders, 
extending from other cells, are divided. 
Gray Matter of the Brain. — The gray matter of the 
brain is not found in a single compact mass. The cere- 
brum, located in the upper and front part of the brain, has 
a covering of gray matter, “like a thin rind,” called the 
cerebral cortex, from yy to $ of an inch in thickness. 
thin the cerebrum, and separated from the gray matter 
of the cortex by a mass of white matter, are found the 
large ganglia — masses of gray matter — which are called - 
the optic thalami. Behind these are the corpora quadri- 
gemina, and behind these, and forming a part of the out- 
side surface of the brain, is the cerebellum. These, with 
the gray masses of the spinal cord, and the medulla ob. 
longata, the body in which the spinal cord termimates, are 
the gray masses of the nervous system in which Psychology 
is especially interested. 
Spinal Cord. — The spinal cord and the brain are con- 
tinuous. There is no point where we can say that the one 
stops and the other begins. Physiologists have, however, 
agreed to regard the cord as commencing opposite the we Se

Thirty-one pairs of nerves enter the spinal cord. Each 
of these nerves, before entering the cord, divides into a 
dorsal and ventral part which are called respectively the 
posterior and the anterior roots of the nerve. The posterior 
root consists of afferent or sensory fibres, the anterior root 
of efferent or motor fibres. |

FOLDS OF THE CORTEX. 35 
The brain is much larger than the spinal cord, and 
much more complex in its structure. The whole brain 
in the adult male weighs on the average about 50 ounces. 
Figure 4 illustrates in a general way the position of the 
various parts of the brain. The fore-brain weighs in man 
bn the average about 44 ounces. It consists chiefly of the 
cerebrum, which is divided into two parts known as the 
cerebral hemispheres by a deep fissure which extends 
through its middle. 
Folds of the Cortex. — The gray cortical rind which 
constitutes the surface of the cerebrum is folded upon 
itself many times as appears from Figure 5. These folds 
are called gyrz or convolutions. Their effect is to greatly 
increase the surface of the brain. It is estimated that if 
the cortex of the brain of a person of average intelligence 
were unfolded it would be found to have an area of about 
four square feet. The folds of the human cortex are 
deeper and more numerous, as a rule, than those of the 
most intelligent animals, and in the brains of the most 
highly civilized nations than in those of savages. 
For reasons which will be stated in a later chapter, the 
cortex of the cerebrum is the part of the brain which is 
supposed to be connected in the closest and most intimate 
way with intelligence. It is, therefore, important for stu- 
dents of Psychology to pay special attention to it. 
If we examine the convolutions of different brains, we / 
shall see that they vary greatly in their details, not only in 
different individuals, but even in the two hemispheres of 
the same brain. The convolutions have been divided into 
primary, secondary and tertiary classes according to the 
strength and clearness and positiveness with which they
-P-A-G-E-45
36 THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
are distinguishable. The primary convolutions have been 
compared to the large mountain ranges whose height and 
breadth and direction give to an extensive territory its 
characteristic features; the secondary convolutions to those 
subordinate ranges which owe their existence to valleys in 
the mountain range, running in the same direction; the 
tertiary convolutions to the small spurs that extend into

good deal of regularity. With them, all regularity stops.

CORTEX A SYSTEM OF ORGANS. 37 
Cortex a System of Organs. — The cortex is a very 
complex organ——perhaps we ought to say, system of organs. 
For it is made up of a vast multitude of nervous elements 
with immovable fibres connecting them with each other 
and with other parts of the nervous system. We shall the 
more clearly realize the reasons for regarding — at least in 
a provisional way — the cortex as a system of organs, if we 
bear in mind what these connecting fibres are. They may 
be divided into four classes. 
Sensory Fibres and the Cortex. — The first class is 
composed of sensory fibres. They may be described in 
brief as the fibres which form the last connecting link 
between the surface of the body where the sensory impulse 
starts, and the centre. I say the last connecting link. For 
the nervous impulse “changes cars,” so to speak, a number 
of times on its way from the surface of the body to the 
cortex. The first change is made when the sensory im- 
pulse reaches the cells in the posterior horns of the spinal 
cord. Sometimes — as in the case of reflex action, here- 
after to be described —the sensory impulse travels no 
farther. But generally it travels upward along fibres which 
run throughout the entire length of the spinal cord to the 
medulla oblongata, where these terminal fibres’ bend at 
right angles and pass into its gray matter. The sensory 
impulse is interrupted here — “changes cars” — but passes 
out of the medulla oblongata through a number of other 
gray masses, until it finally reaches the cortex. These 
fibres then, the fibres which form the last connecting link 
between the various parts of the surface and the centre, 
are the first of the four classes which terminate in the 
cortex.

sensory impulses. On the left side, S, S’, 
represent afferent spinal nerve fibres; C,an 
afferent cranial nerve fibre. This fibre in 
each case terminates near a central cell, the 
fibre of which crosses the middle line, and 
ends in the opposite hemisphere. (Modified 
from Donaldson.) connecting fibres in the 
cortex are those that 
form the first connect- 
ing link between the 
cortex and the volun- 
tary muscles. These 
y motor fibres, as we 
may term them, are the 
paths by which motor 
impulses travel from 
the cortex. The entire 
path from the cortex 
to the muscle has been 
divided into two parts 
—the central motor 
path and the peripheral 
motor path. The cen- 
- tral motor path — in 
the case of the spinal 
motor nerve — consists 
of (1) the fibres extend- 
ing from the cells in 
the cortex, and (2) the 
fibres extending up. 
wards from the motor 
cells of the anterior 
horns of the spinal cord. 
The peripheral motor 
path consists of the 
fibres connecting the 
same motor cell with the muscle. The motor fibres

of the cortex constitute the first part of the central 
motor path. 
Association Fibres. — The third class of connecting 
fibres are called association fibres. They connect one part 
of the cortex with another. Says Edinger: “They extend 
everywhere from convolution to convolution, connecting 
parts which lie near each other as well as those which 
are widely separated.” They are called association fibres 
because it is supposed to be by means of them that we are 
able to associate one experience with another.

fibres are those which connect identical parts of the two 
hemispheres of the cerebrum with each other. They are 
called commissural.

LESSON V. 
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
Functions of the Fibres. — After this brief survey of 
the nervous system we are ready to consider its functions. - 
It is evident ‘that the office of the fibres is to conduct 
nervous excitations. When you snatch your hand away 
from a hot stove, the pain is not in the hand; for, if the 
nerve which connects the hand with the spinal cord is 
divided, you will feel no pain. The burn has caused a 
change in the ends of the nerve that terminate in the 
injured part, and this change has been transmitted along 
the nerve to the spinal cord. The same kind of evidence 
shows that the motor nerves running from the spinal cord ; 
to the muscles have the same office. For, if the nerves 
extending to the muscles of your arm be divided, you can 
not snatch your hand away when you feel the sensation of 
pain. You will be like an animal shot by an arrow which 
has been dipped in the poison called curari—a poison 
which renders the motor nerves incapable of action, while 
it does not affect the sensory nerves. You will feel the 
pain, but will be unable to move your hand. 
Nature of a Nervous Impulse. — As to the nature of 
the change which takes place during the passage of a 
nervous impulse, physiologists and psychologists are almost
-P-A-G-E-51
42 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
entirely ignorant. Says Professor Martin : “ Since between 
sense organs and sensory centres, and these latter and the 
muscles, nervous impulses are the only means of communi- 
cation, it is through them that we arrive at our opinions 
concerning the external universe and through them that 
we are able to act upon it; their ultimate nature is there- 
fore a matter of great interest, but one about which we 
unfortunately know very little.” ! 
Nerve centres also conduct nervous excitations, but this 
is not their most characteristic work. Perhaps the best 
way to realize what this is, is to contrast reflex with volun+ 
tary actions, as many physiologists understand it. 
We all know what is meant by voluntary actions. They 
are actions which seem to be the result of our volitions. 
For certain conscious reasons, we will to act in a*téftain 
way, and the action follows. Ct however, the act takes 
place as the result of the stimulation of an afferent nerve, 
without the intervention of consciousness, it is called 
reflex. 
Voluntary, Reflex and Semi-reflex Actions. — Pro- 
fessor James gives a ciear illustration of the difference 
between voluntary and reflex actions and a kind of action 
intermediate between the two, “If I hear the conductor 
calling ‘All aboard! as I enter the depot,” he says, “my 
heart first stops, then palpitates, and my legs respond to 
the air waves falling upon my tympanum by quickening 
their movements, If I stumble as I run, the sensation of 
falling provokes the movement of the hands towards the 
direction of the fall, the effect of which is to shield the 
body from too sudden a shock. If a cinder enter my eye, °

-P-A-G-E-52
MECHANICAL NATURE OF REFLEX ACTIONS. 43 
its lids close forcibiy, and a copious flow of tears tends to 
wash it out.”? 
In this illustration we have examples of three different 
kinds of action. The quickening of the pace in con- 
sequence of the conductor’s “ All aboard!” is an example 
of voluntary action. It is an action following upon a dis- 
tinct volition, or at least upon a definite state of conscious- 
ness. With the closure of the eye, on the other hand, and 
the flow of tears, consciousness had nothing to do. The 
nervous impulse caused by the cinder passed along -an 
afferent nerve leading from the eye to a certain nerw: 
centre, and that centre imparted an impulse to an efferen: 
nerve connected with the muscles whose contraction result: 
in the closure of the eye, and the result was the closure of 
the eye without the intervention of consciousness. Such 
actions are called reflex. 
The movement of the hands illustrates what is some- 
‘times called semi-reflex actions, and sometimes acquired 
reflexes. The last term is the better because it marks 
the two essential facts in the case: (1) The action so 
characterized is now performed without the intervention of 
consciousness. In that respect it is like reflex actions, so 
called. (2) Such actions were not originally so performed. 
They are therefore said to be acquired reflexes. 
Mechanical Nature of Reflex Actions. — That the 
actions described as reflex are mechanical, there can be no 
manner of doubt. Certain afferent and efferent nerves, 
with the nerve centres of which they are outgrowths or 
prolongations, with the muscles with which the efferent 
nerves are connected, are the mechanical contrivances for 
1 James’s Psychology, p. 12.

44 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
the performance of certain particular kinds of actions. 
Any correct definition you may make of a machine will 
apply equally well to the mechanism concerned in reflex 
action. Pull the trigger of a gun and it fires; put acinder 
in the eye and it closes. Strike a certain key of a piano 
and it produces a certain note. Stroke the flanks of a 
brainless frog and it croaks. : 
I will not stop here to enlarge upon the fact that a large 
number of actions originally voluntary become acquired 
reflexes —- which is only a way of saying that certain nerve 
centres can be educated ‘to perform, without the aid of 
consciousness, actions of which they were quite incapable 
in the beginning. What I wish to emphasize is the fact 
that.many eminent physiologists and not a few psycholo- 
gists believe that there is no real difference between reflex 
actions and voluntary actions, except in the degree of com- 
plexity of the mechanism by means of which they are 
brought about. ‘ 
The Automatic Theory. — Says the physiologist Foster: © 
“The real difference between an automatic (reflex) action 
and a voluntary act is that the chain of physiological | 
events between the act and its physiological cause is in | 
the one case short and simple, in the other long and com- j 
plex.” In other words—according to this doctrine —— as 
a segment of the spinal cord, with its afferent and effer- | 
ent nerves, may be regarded as a comparatively simple [| 
machine, the cerebrum, with the nerves and the nerve 
centres connected with it, is likewise a machine, only very 
much more complex and intricate in its structure. As you 
can not help closing your eye when a cinder gets into it, 
your spinal cord being what it is, so you can not help read- 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
THE AUTOMATIC THEORY. 45 
ing this chapter, providing you are reading it, your cere- 
brum being what it is. As consciousness certainly has 
nothing to do with reflex actions — so the doctrine asserts 
it has nothing to do with so-called voluntary actions. If 
you could find a machine whose actions made no noise, it 
would illustrate the reflex machinery of our bodies in that 
such a machine acts without consciousness. The ordinary, 
more or less noisy machinery with which we are acquainted 
illustrates the nervous mechanism by which so-called vol- 
untary actions are performed, For, as the noise of the 
machine contributes nothing whatever to what the machine 
does, as it is the inert effect of its activity, so (accord- 
ing to the doctrine) consciousness—-our feelings, hopes, 
fears, volitions——has nothing whatever to do with our 
actions. We get up, eat, walk, write, read, study, go on 
journeys, adapt a long series of actions to what seems an 
intelligent purpose, not because we are intelligent, con- 
scious beings, but because our bodies are supplied with a 
wonderful piece of mechanism — the cerebrum. 
Some crude diagrams may help to make the matter 
clear.

Diagram I illustrates the mechanism of reflex action. The 
line AB represents the afferent nerve along which a nerv- 
ous impulse travels to the nerve centre BC, anteCD the 
efferent nerve along which the nervous impulse is deflected 
by the nerve centre. This illustrates in a rough way the
-P-A-G-E-55
46 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
mechanism of reflex action. A nervous impulse starts at 
one point 4 and is propagated to a nerve centre, where it 
is deflected and propagated in the opposite direction by a 
nerve centre. The action from start to finish is purely 
material. Consciousness has no more to do with it than it 
has with the falling of a house which is blown down by a 
tornado. . 
Diagram 2 illustrates the mechanism of so-called volun~ 
tary action — according to the doctrine. The line AB 
represents the path of a nervous impulse to a nerve centre 
as before. But instead of deflecting the nervous impulse 
in the opposite direction along the efferent nerve CD, the 
. nerve centre transmits the impulse along the nerve BF to 
the cortex-—the cortical cells deflect it in the opposite 
direction and propagate it along the nerve GC. Although 
consciousness accompanies such actions, it has nothing to 
do with causing them——according to the theory. A mate- 
rial change at A was the occasion of the nervous impulse, 
itself only a material changeywhich travels to B; a mate- 
rial change at B was the occasion of a nervous impulse —_ 
material change — which travels to the cells of the cortex ; 
a material change in the cells of the cortex caused the 
nervous impulse — material change — along the nerves GC 
and CD. From start to finish the action is material, and 
material only. And although at a certain point in the path 
consciousness appears, this consciousness has no more to 
do with the action that follows than the whiz of a moving: 
wheel has with its motion. 
Objections to the Theory. — I have not explained this 
theory for the purpose of criticising it. A theory that flies 
so rudely in the face of common sense does not neeg 
  ; ’
-P-A-G-E-56

criticism in the case of the great majority of students. 
Most of us, I am confident, will feel sure that it is rather 
the result of the limitations in the knowledge of the spe- 
cialists who hold it than the proved outcome of incontest- 
able reasoning. Most of us will feel that these specialists 
have their faces toward their laboratories, and their backs 
toward life, with its almost infinite wealth of intricate and 
complex adaptations of means to ends. If we could forget 
these adaptations, these manifestations of intelligence in 
ourselves and others which meet us on every hand, it would 
doubtless be easy to accept a theory which reduces the 
actions which our bodies perform to one ultimate type, a 
theory which banishes consciousness from the scene of 
causality as an unwelcome intruder and disturber of that 
perfect unity, the realization of which is the ideal of the 
scientific mind. But with a vivid appreciation of these 
manifestations of intelligence we shall not be disturbed by 
the speculations of these theorists, and the less so in view 
of the fact that some of the most eminent psychologists in 
the world — among them Professors Wundt, James and 
Ladd — in full view of all the evidence that seems to sup- 
port the theory, have rejected it. . 
Function of the Nerve Centres. — I have called atten- 
tion to the theory because it seems to me to put in a clear 
light what is admitted by all parties to be the function of 
the nervous centres —- what we shall call the co-ordination 
of nervous impulse, in such a way as to cause the outgoing 
impulses to produce an apparently purposive result. To 
exhibit the evidence in detail for this conclusion in such a 
~. book as this is impossible, but it may. be said that the 
whole difference between the psychologists like Professors
-P-A-G-E-57
48 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
James, Wundt and Ladd, who reject the theory I have 
described — called the automaton theory —- and those who 
hold it, is as to the extent to which this work of co-ordina- 
tion is performed by the nerve centres without the aid of 
consciousness. The former admit that some of the centres 
of the nervous system perform this work of co-ordination 
without the aid of consciousness; they also admit that 
where consciousness intervenes, these nerve centres are 
the mechanism it employs. The automatists, on the other 
hand, maintain that this work of co-ordination is in all 
cases the unassisted work of the nerve centres. 
Mechanism Required in Reflex Actions. — The mech- 
anism required in reflex actions is clear, from what has 
been said of them. It consists (1) of a sensitive surface 
exterior or interior, (2) an afferent nerve, (3) a cell or 
nerve centre connecting the afferent nerve with the sensi- 
tive surface (4) of an efferent nerve connecting the nerve 
centre with (5) a muscle or muscles.’ : 
The afferent impulse starts in (1), passes along (2), 
reaches (3), is there changed into an efferent impulse, 
which passes along (4), finally reaches (5), where it causes 
a contraction of a muscle or muscles. The essence of 
reflex action, then, consists in the change by means of the 
protoplasm of a nerve cell of an afferent into an efferent 
impulse.? : 
Efferent Impulses.— An efferent impulse is not simply fet RARE ee 
a deflection of an afferent impulse. A crumb of bread in 
1¥For the sake of simplicity, I omit from consideration those reflex 
actions in which the efferent nerve is not connected with muscles.

AUTOMATIC ACTIONS. 49 
contact with the glottis may occasion a violent fit of cough- 
ing‘ in which not only all the respiratory muscles, but 
nearly all the muscles of the body, are brought into action. 
The efferent impulse which stimulated the muscles whose 
contraction resulted in coughing is not in such a case a 
mere deflection of the afferent impulse. The afferent 
impulse was slight and feeble; the efferent impulse was 
extensive and powerful, and was communicated to a large 
number of nerves. Evidently, the number and character 
of efferent impulses in any given case depend primarily 
not on the afferent impulse, but on the changes which 
take place in the nerve centres. 
Automatic Actions. — In addition to the functions of 
the nerve centres in reflex action, acquired reflexes and 
voluntary actions, some of them have functions which seem 
to be sharply contrasted with these. These are the auto- 
matic centres, “ which are centres not directly excited by 
nerve fibres conveying impulses to them, but in other 
ways.” For example, the movements in breathing do not 
depend upon consciousness. In that respect they are con- 
trasted with voluntary actions. But the nerve centres 
that propagate the nervous excitation to the muscles con- 
cerned in breathing are not themselves excited to activity 
by afferent fibres leading to them. They are stimulated* 
directly by the blood that flows through them. Actions 
so resulting are, in this respect, contrasted with reflex 
actions. 
We have then four classes of actions: (1) automatic 
actions —in which the nerve centres concerned are not 
stimulated by afferent fibres ; (2) reflex actions — in which 
the centres are stimulated by afferent fibres, and to which
-P-A-G-E-59
50 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 
they respond with machine-like directness and regularity : 
(3) acquired reflexes —- in which the centres are also stim- 
ulated by afferent fibres, and in which they now respond 
with machine-like directness, and regularity, but in which 
they did not have that power to begin with; (4) voluntary 
‘actions — whose differentiating characteristic is that the 
centres concerned in their production seem to depend on 
the will. 
Centres of Automatic Action. —The medulla oblongata 
contains numerous centres of automatic action, among 
them the movements employed in breathing. If the brain 
is removed above the medulla, the breathing movements 
are hardly disturbed at all. But if the medulla is removed 
or injured, all breathing stops, even though the injury be 
confined entirely to the medulla, the muscles and nerves 
concerned in breathing being entirely uninjured. 
The Cerebellum. — The cerebellum is the organ for 
many acquired reflexes. We all know how easy it is to 
walk, and at the same time concentrate our entire atten- 
tion on a conversation. All that it seems necessary for 
the mind or consciousness to have to do with it is to 
set the machine well going, so to speak, when some part of 
the nervous mechanism relieves consciousness of all further 
work in the matter. We have forgotten how we learned 
to walk, but we all remember how necessary it was to give 
our entire attention to our movements when we were learn- 
ing to skate or ride a bicycle. But the experienced skater 
or cyclist can skate or ride with as little attention to what 
he is doing as we are obliged to give to walking. 
The difference between a man who can skate and one 
wee

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSION. 51 
who can not is that the one can and the other can not 
control his muscles in such a way as to produce the 
desired result. And the difference between the man who 
can only skate by giving his entire attention to it, and the 
one who can skate and think about something else, is that 
in the one case the mandate to the necessary muscles pro- ~ 
ceeds from the cerebrum, the centre directly connected 
with consciousness; in the other, from a centre not 
directly, connected with consciousness. In other words, 
in the case of the person learning to skate, walk, ride a 
wheel, play on a musical instrument, the nervous impulse 
to the proper muscles proceeds directly from the cortex of 
the cerebrum. In the case of a person who has learned 
to walk, or the skillful skater or wheelman, all that the, 
cortex of the cerebrum seems to do is to initiate the action, 
when the supervision and further direction of it is carried 
on by a lower centre. That centre seems to be the cere- 
bellum. The reason for this conclusion may be summarized 
as follows: When the cerebellum is injured, the most 
marked result seems to be a loss of the power to perform 
the acquired reflexes used in locomotion. ~~ 
Summary of Conclusion. — We may then sum up the 
results of this chapter as follows: The functions of the. 
nervous system may be broadly divided into two classes — 
those of the fibres or nerves, and those of the cells or 
centres, The office of the fibres is to conduct excitations 
to and from the centres. The centres are concerned in 
four kinds of actions: automatic, reflex, acquired reflexes, 
and voluntary. The medulla oblongata is one of the cen- 
tres from which automatic actions proceed. The spinal 
cord is pre-eminently a centre of reflex actions. It is also
-P-A-G-E-61

a centre of many acquired reflexes. The cerebellum is 
the centre for the acquired reflexes used in locomotion. 
We will consider the functions of the cerebrum in the next 
lesson.

LESSON VI. 
  a 
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 
Cerebrum and Intelligence. — That the cerebrum is 
more closely related to intelligence than any other part of 
the nervous system, is proved by the same evidence that 
goes to show that the brain is the organ of the mind. 
Re-read the lesson on that subject and you will have 
before you the evidence that has convinced -physiologists 
and psychologists that the cerebrum is in a special sense _ 
the organ of the mind. The blow on the head that 
deprives one of consciousness is a blow that affects the 
cerebrum. The nervous connection that must be main- 
tained in order that pain may be felt, is the connection 
between the injured part and the cerebrum. The injuries 
to the brain that result in the impairment of memory or 
aphasia are injuries of the cerebrum. 
Cortex and Intelligence.— But the cerebrum is a 
large organ. Is there any evidence to show that any par- 
ticular part or parts of it sustain this especially intimate 
relation to intelligence? There is nearly a consensus of 
opinion among physiologists and psychologists to the effect 
that there is such a part, and that is the thin rind of gray 
matter called the cortex. 
The evidence for this opinion may be stated under two 
53
-P-A-G-E-63
54 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 
heads: (1) The higher an animal stands in the scale of 
intelligence, the deeper and more numerous, as a rule, are 
the folds or convolutions of the cortex. Remembering 
that these folds increase the surface of the cortex, we may 
say that, as a rule, the higher an animal stands in the 
scale of intelligence, the greater the extent of the surface 
of its cortex in proportion to its size. There are, indeed, 
a few exceptions to the rule. A few animals, not high in 
the scale of intelligence, have deeper and more extended 
folds than other animals standing above them in that scale. 
(2) The cerebral functions, so far as they have been 
located, have been located in the cortex. All the evidence, 
therefore, for the localization of those functions points to 
the same conclusion. What, then, is the nature of that 
evidence ? 
Meaning of ‘Localization of Functions.’? — Before 
attempting to answer this question, let us try to get a-clear 
idea of what is meant by “localization of mental func- 
tions.” The question which the theory undertakes to 
answer may be stated as follows: Have different parts of 
the cerebrum the same work to do in relation to our men- 
tal life? Do they sustain the same relation to the life of 
sensation, memory, and voluntary motion? Those who 
say that they have, deny, and those who say that they 
have not, affirm, the localization of the cerebral functions. 
Presumptions in Favor of it.—The most general 
knowledge of the nervous system would lead one to expect 
some localization of the functions of the cerebrum. We 
have seen that there are sensory nerves and motor nerves 
—nerves that minister to sensation and nerves that min~
-P-A-G-E-64
THE DOCTRINE COMPARATIVELY NEW. 55 
ister to motion. A further study of the nerves shows us 
that this division of labor is carried much farther. Some 
of the efferent nerves are motor and some are not; some 
of the motor nerves are voluntary and some involuntary. 
Moreover, each motor nerve is connected ‘with some par- 
ticular muscle, not with the muscles in general. And 
precisely as the motor nerves are each of them connected 
Yat their peripheral terminations with certain particular 
muscles, so they have their origin in different parts of the 
brain. It is difficult to believe that the nervous impulse 
that travels along them to the muscles does not have its 
origin in some definite cell or group of cells. In like man- 
ner the sensory nerves that connect the surface of the 
body with the cortex must connect that surface with a 
definite part of the cortex, provided they go to the cortex 
at all. The nerves that proceed from the end of my little 
finger and connect it with the cortex must terminate in 
some definite place ; they cannot terminate in the brain in 
general. : 
The presumption, thus created, that different parts of 
the cerebrum will be found to have different offices to per- 
form in relation to our mental life, is strengthened by a 
consideration of the nerve centres. The gray matter of 
the spinal cord is a succession of centres for the perform- 
ance of different reflex actions; the medulla oblongata is 
a group of centres for various automatic actions, each hav- 
ing its own definite place. Whether, then, we consider 
nerve fibres or the lower centres, a strong presumption in 
favor of the localization of cerebral functions is created. 
The Doctrine Comparatively New.— Nevertheless, 
the doctrine as a scientific theory is only a little more,
-P-A-G-E-65
56 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM 
than a quarter of a century old. The most eminent 
authorities in physiology half a century ago decided em- 
phatically against it. One of them declared that he had 
“experimented upon the cortex of different animals, dogs, 
rabbits, and kids, “had irritated it mechanically, cauterized 
it with potash, nitric acid, etc., and had passed galvanic 
currents through it, in different directions, without obtain 
ing any signs whatever of muscular contractions.” * 
The same year another eminent physiologist summed 
up the results of numerous experiments with the declara- 
tion that the various parts of the cerebrum have no special 
function, but that the lobes of the cerebrum perform their 
functions with their whole mass. 
In 1870 Fritsch and Hitzig began the investigations, 
which, with those of many other workers in the same field, 
have caused the opinion of those physiologists to be over- 
thrown. It has been perfectly established that certain 
parts of the cerebrum, at least, have certain specific func- 
tions in our mental life. , 
In stating the evidence for this conclusion no descrip- 
tion will be attempted of the particular parts of the cortex 
which have been proved to be connected with particular 
mental activities. Knowledge of this sort can be best 
imparted by diagrams, and upon these I shall rely for 
making clear the areas of the cortex concerned in particu- 
lar mental activities so far as they are known. 
The localizations most clearly established are the motor 
areas, those areas from which the nervous impulse starts 
which results in the contraction of the voluntary muscles. 
The evidence which proves that. there are such areas is of 
various kinds.

-P-A-G-E-66
EFFECTS OF STIMULATION. 57 
Effects of Stimulation. —(1) It has been proved that 
the stimulation of a definite part of the cortex of dogs, 
monkeys and other animals produces definite movements, 
sometimes in the face, sometimes in the hind-legs, some- 
times in the fore-legs, sometimes in the tail, according to 
the part stimulated. A savage, upon accidentally strik- 
ing a key of a piano, might suppose that there was no real 
connection between his action and the sound that followed 
it, that the one followed the other by accident. But if he 
struck the same key again and again, and if he extended 
his experiments to the other keys of the piano, he could 
hardly fail to believe that there was a causal connection 
between each particular key and the sound that followed 
it. In like manner, when we learn that the stimulation of 
a particular part of the cortex, both by electricity and 
mechanically, is invariably followed by a particular move- 
ment; when we learn that this movement does not follow 
if this connection between the part of the cortex stim- 
ulated and the nerve centres at the base of the brain has 
been cut off, it is impossible not to believe that that part 
of the cortex is the place from which the motor nerves 
that lead to the muscles concerned in the movement take 
their origin. 
Effects of Removal of Parts of the Brain of Animals. 
—(2) While stimulating definite areas of the cortex occa- 
sions a definite movement of a definite part of the body, 
it has been proved that a removal of the cortical area 
which has been shown by stimulation to be connected 
with a definite movement, deprives the animal of the 
power to perform that movement.
-P-A-G-E-67
58 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 
Difficulties. — It must indeed be admitted that these 
experiments do not permit such definite, clear-cut con- 
clusions as those arising from the experiments described 
in the preceding paragraph. For it has been proved that 
the loss of the power to perform definite movements which 
results from a removal of a particular part of the cortex is 
not permanent. Says Professor James: “ Even when the 
entire motor zone of a dog is removed, there is no perma- 
nent paralysis of any sort.” 
Explanation of these Difficulties. — The explanation 
of these facts is too intricate and involved to be under- 
taken in such a book as this. I will only say that the 
generally accepted explanation is that other centres some- 
how learn to do the work usually performed by the cen- 
tres which have been destroyed. If we bear in mind that 
every cortical centre may be regarded from one point ‘of 
view as the place where incoming currents, along afferent 
fibres, become outgoing currents along efferent fibres, 
and if we remember that innumerable fibres connect every 
cortical centre with every other, we shall perhaps be able 
to form some idea of how this is possible. As a train, by 
the destruction of the city of Chicago with all its tracks 
and depots, although prevented from going from New 
York to Denver by its customary route, would neverthe- 
less eventually reach its destination by another route, so 
nerve currents, at first prevented from reaching their des- 
tination — particular muscles — by the destruction of the 
depots —-nerve centres — on their customary route, might 
eventually reach this destination over new routes or new 
paths. . 
But whatever may be the explanation of the fact that
-P-A-G-E-68
MEN SUFFERING FROM BRAIN DISEASE. 59 
animals whose motor areas have been removed somehow 
learn to perform the movements which they were unable 
to perform, the fact can not overthrow the conclusion that 
definite parts of the cortex are the centres particularly 
concerned in definite movements. 
Observations of Men Suffering from Local Brain Dis-_ 
ease. — Observations of men suffering from local brain 
disease have helped to put this conclusion beyond the 
reach of doubt. These observations have made it possible 
to map out with a great deal of definiteness the areas 
of the brain concerned with particular movements. Not 
only have the centres for the legs and face been mapped 
out, but within the areas of these centres smaller ones 
have been mapped out, areas which are concerned with 
definite movements of the parts of the body concerned. 
Thus, the areas concerned with the motion of the eyelids, 
with the muscles of the angle of the mouth, all have their 
definite positions in the area for the face. ‘So definite,” 
says Professor Martin, “are the positions of these areas that 
in cases of localized paralysis, diagnosed as due to lesions 
of the cerebral cortex, surgeons now have no hesitation in 
opening the skull in order if possible to remove the cause 
of trouble, as a small tumor: they know precisely in what 
spot they will find it.”? 
Said Dr. W. W. Keen: “When I say that the existence 
of a tumor about the size of the end of the forefinger can 
be diagnosticated, and before touching the head it should 
be said (and I was present when the statement was made) 
that it was a small tumor, that it did not lie on the surface 
of the brain but a little underneath it, and that it lay 
1 Martin’s Phystology, p. 624.
-P-A-G-E-69
60 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 
partly under the centre for the face and partly under that 
for the arm in the left side of the brain, and that the man 
was operated on and the tumor was found exactly where 
it was believed to be, with perfect recovery of the patient, 
—it is something which ten years ago would have been 
declared the art of a magician rather than the cold preci- 
sion of science.” Evidence such as this may be regarded 
as conclusive, however difficult we may find it to explain 
to ourselves all the related facts. 
Aphasia. — Observations of persons suffering from 
aphasia confirm this same conclusion. As mentioned in a 
preceding lesson, in every case in which a post-mortem 
examination of the brain of a person suffering from motor 
aphasia has been permitted, an injury has been found in a 
certain definite part of the brain. The curious facts in 
connection with aphasia, for example, that a person has 
control of his voice but can not talk, or that he dan write 
intelligently but can’ not talk, or that he can write but can 
not say what he wishes to say, or that he can write but 
can not read what he has written, are easily explained by 
the theory of localization of cerebral functions. 
If we suppose the cortical centre for the control of the 
voice and for talking are different, it is easy to see that 
the injury of the one is not necessarily the injury of the 
other, and that, therefore, there is no necessary connection 
between the loss of the power to talk and the ability to 
control the voice. In like manner it is easy to see that 
the centre for writing may not be impaired, even if the 
association fibres that connect the writing centre with the 
cells concerned in the production of certain ideas are 
injured. Also, a person whose centre for talking is injured 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
HERING ON FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 61, 
will be unable to talk, but that will not prevent him from 
being able to write, if the writing centre is unimpaired. 
Nor will the fact that a person can write enable him to 
read what he has written if the association fibres connect- 
ing the centres concerned in seeing with the centres cor- 
responding to the idea of what is read are injured. 
Hering on the Functions of the Cerebrum.— Professor 
E. Hering states his conclusions as to the functions of the 
cerebrum in the following language: “ The different parts 
of the hemispheres are like a great tool-box with a count- 
less variety of tools. Each single element of the cerebrum 
is a particular tool. Consciousness may be likened to an 
artisan whose tools gradually become so numerous, so 
varied and so specialized that he has for every minutest 
detail of his work a tool which is especially adapted to 
perform just this precise kind of work very easily and 
accurately. If he loses one of his tools he still possesses 
a thousand other tools to do the same work, though under 
disadvantages both with reference to adaptability and the 
time involved. Should he happen to lose the use of these 
thousand also, he might retain hundreds with which to do 
the work still, but under greatly increased difficulty. . He 
must needs have lost a very large number of his tools if 
certain actions become absolutely impossible.” 
Problem of Physiological Psychology. — The assertion 
that each single element of the cerebrum is a particular 
tool specially adapted to perform a certain work in con- 
sciousness goes a long way beyond the evidence. The 
sensations of sight, sound, smell, touch and taste have 
been localized with varying degrees of probability. But
-P-A-G-E-71
62 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 
if the famous postulate of Meynert becomes satisfactorily 
proved, as seems possible, the most distinctive features 
of the consciousness of human beings will remain unex- 
plained. Professor James states that postulate in the 
following language: “The highest centres contain nothing 
but arrangements for representing impressions and move- 
ments, and other arrangements for coupling the activity 
of these arrangements together.” Suppose this proved. 
Suppose we knew the cortical centre for each sensation 
and each movement, and each idea of a sensation and 
each idea of a movement; suppose also we knew the 
association fibres by means of which one sensation (cor- 
tical centre) is connected with another sensation (cortical 
centre), shall we have then an explanation of all the tools 
which consciousness uses? We shall, provided the entire 
mental life consists of sensations and ideas, and assocta- 
tions of sensations and ideas. But if this is not all of the 
mental life, ¢ it leaves out of account the. distinctive 
feature of mental life, the consciousness of relations, as I 
maintain that it does, then thinking (which consists in 
the consciousness of relations) is a part of the mental 
life which in the nature of the case can not be explained ~ 
by the cerebrum. Upon this conception of the matter, the 
work possible to Physiological Psychology will have been 
done when Meynert’s postulate shall have been satisfac- 
torily proved in all its details. But consciousness, as the 
relating activity of the mind, as binding sensations into a 
whole of consciously related parts (concepts), and concepts 
into a whole of consciously related parts (judgments), and 
judgments into a whole of consciously related parts (acts 
of reasoning), —all these distinctive and unique features 
of the human mind must seek their explanation in a

LESSON VII. 
WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? 
What is Psychology ? — The answer usually given is 
that Psychology is the science of the mind or soul. But 
what is the soul? People who have not thought carefully 
about it would probably say that, whatever it is, it cer- 
tainly is not the mind. Animals, they would say, plainly 
have minds, but no one believes that they have souls. 
Do Animals Have Souls ? — It may serve to give clear- 
ness to our ideas to consider the question whether or not 
animals have souls. Without doubt, 2 the confused sense 
in which the word is used in popular language, the true 
answer is that they have. If you suppose that animals 
have no souls, let me ask you if you have one. You will 
undoubtedly say that you have. Suppose I ask you 
whether you are always dreaming when you are asleep. 
You will probably answer that you are not. And when 
you say that you are not dreaming, what do you mean? 
“T mean,” I imagine you saying, “that there are no 
thoughts or feelings in my mind.” 
“ And when there are no thoughts and feelings in your 
mind, does your soul continue to exist?” 
“TI do not understand you.” 
“You say that you do not think you are always dream: , 
65
-P-A-G-E-75
66 WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? } 
not dreaming, you say that you mean that you have no 
thoughts or feelings in your mind. So far as thoughts 
and feelings go, I understand you to say that you are 
exactly like a dead man. A dead man has no thoughts 
and feelings, neither have you when you are not dreaming. 
Now, when you have no thoughts and feelings in your 
mind, does your soul continue to exist?” 
“T certainly believe it does, as I have no reason to 
believe that it ceases to exist when I fall asleep and begins 
to exist as soon as I awake, as must be the case if it 
ceases to exist when I have no thoughts and feelings.” 
“Then you do not mean by soul the thoughts and feel- 
ings of which you are conscious, or a part of those thoughts 
and feelings?” | ing when you are asleep ; and when you say that you are | 
| 
| 
| | 
« Again I do not understand you.” 
“You say that your soul does not cease to exist when 
you have no thoughts or feelings ; now, if it does not, your 
soul can not be your thoughts and feelings, can it?” 
“Why not?” | 
“Because if it were, when you have no thoughts and | 
feelings, you would have no soul, would you?” 
“T see that I would not.” 
«And it can not be a part of your thoughts and feel- 
ings?” 
“No, for if it were any part of them when I had none 
of any kind, I would have no soul.” 
“You mean by soul, then, not thoughts and feelings, 
but the thing that as thoughts and feelings?” | 
« Again I am obliged to say that I do not understand 
you.”

lesson on Psychology in this way: ‘Students, think about 
the wall.’ After a moment’s pause: ‘ Now think about 
the thing that thinks about the wall. The thing that 
thinks about the wall is what is to be the subject of your 
study.’ That is what you mean by soul, is it not—the 
thing which thinks and feels, the thing which has thoughts 
and feelings?” 
“It is.” 
« And what do you mean by mind?” 
“T mean that which thinks and feels, or that which has 
thoughts and feelings.” 
«But things which are identical with the same thing” 
are identical with each other, are they not?” é 
“ They are.’ 
« And if the soul is that which thinks and feels, and the 
mind is that which thinks and feels, they must be the 
same, must they not?” 
“T see that they must.” 
“Tf then you say that dogs, for instance, have minds, 
can you refuse to admit that they have souls?” 
“T am obliged to confess that I can not.” 
The Soul One of Three Things. —In this imaginary 
dialogue you may say that in the nature of the case I can 
prove what I wish to prove, since I can put any words in 
your mouth I please. But if you will carefully consider 
it, you will see that you are obliged to say that the soul is 
one of three things: It is either a// of our thoughts and 
feelings, or a part of them, or the thing which 4as thoughts 
and feelings— the thing which thinks and feels and wills. 
If you say that the soul is all or a part of our thoughts 
and feelings—+ mental facts, in a word —then, instead of
-P-A-G-E-77
68 WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY ? 
saying that Psychology is the science of the soul, it would 
be much plainer to say that Psychology is the science of 
mental facts. But if you say that the soul is that which 
thinks and feels and wills, then, as we have seen, there is 
no difference between soul and mind, and we are left with 
the definition, Psychology is the science of the mind. 
Meaning of Mind. — But what do you mean by mind ? 
What we have seen in the case of the soul —that it con- 
sists of thoughts, feelings, and acts of the will, or that 
which thinks, feels, and wills —is plainly true of the mind 
also. It must either be ¢hat which thinks, feels, and wills, 
or it must be the thoughts, feelings, and acts of will of 
which we are conscious—- mental facts, in one word. But 
what do we know about ¢hat which thinks, feels, and wills, 
and what can we find out about it? Where is it? You 
will probably say, in the brain. But if you are speaking 
literally, if you say that it is in the brain, as a pencil is in 
the pocket, then you must mean that it takes up room, ' 
that it occupies space, and that would make it very much 
like a material thing. In truth, the more carefully you | 
consider it, the more plainly you will see what thinking 
men have known for a long time — that we do not know 
and can not learn anything about the thing which thinks 
and feels and wills. It is beyond the range of human 
knowledge. The books which define Psychology as the 
science of mind have not a word to say about that whic?’ 
thinks and feels and wills. They are entirely taken wp, 
with these thoughts and feelings and acts of the will — |, 
mental facts, in a word —trying to tell us what they are, 
and to arrange them in classes, and tell us the circum 
stances or conditions under which they exist.

-P-A-G-E-78
DEFINITION OF MENTAL FACTS. 69 
It seems to me, therefore, that it would be better to 
define Psychology as the science of the experiences, phe- 
nomena, or facts of the mind, soul, or self—of mental 
Sacts, in a word. 
Definition of Mental Facts. — But what is a mental 
fact? Let us say, to start with, that it is a fact known 
directly to but one person, and that the person experi- 
encing it. If you are standing on the street with a half 
dozen friends, you can all see the houses, and men and 
women and horses. You can all hear the tramping of feet 
and the clatter of the vehicles that pass along the street. 
These facts are open to the observation of all of you alike. 
But there is a class of facts known directly to but one of 
you—-what you think and feel and will, you know, and 
no one else does; what A thinks and feels and wills, he 
knows, and no one else does. These thoughts and feelings 
and volitions are experiences, phenomena, or facts of the 
mind, soul, or self — mental facts, in a word — facts 
known to but one person directly, and that the person 
experiencing them. 
Unconscious Mental Facts. — But I believe there are 
mental facts not known to any one. If you are intent 
upon a book, the clock may strike and you may not hear 
it at the time, and a minute after you may be entirely sure 
that you heard the clock strike a minute before, although ~ 
you did not know at the time that you heard it. The true 
explanation of facts like these seems to be that the clock 
produced a sensation which you would have known was a 
sensation of sound if you had attended to it at the time 
the clock struck, and in the sense of having received a
-P-A-G-E-79
70 WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY ¢ 
sensation because of the clock, you heard it. But you did 
not know that you heard it until the minute after. Now, 
what must we call this sensation? Plainly a mental fact, 
although there was a time when it was not known by any 
one. Still, however, it is marked off quite sharply from 
all other facts—- physical facts we may call them, which 
may be known with equal directness by any number of 
people — by the circumstance that, although not known, 
it is knowable by but one person, and that the person 
experiencing it. We may then define a mental fact asa 
fact known or knowable to but one person directly, and 
that the person experiencing it, and Psychology as the 
science of mental facts, or the science of the facts of mind.

LESSON VIII. 
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY. : 
In the last lesson I tried to point out the subject of 
which Psychology treats. I objected to the usual defini- 
tion, “ Psychology is the science of the mind or soul,” not 
becaise it is incorrect, but because I do not believe it 
gives young students definite ideas. I want you to get at 
the outset the clearest possible riotion of the subject you 
are to study. I want you to realize that the facts of which 
you are directly conscious, the facts known directly to you 
only —that these and similar facts form the subject of 
which Psychology treats. 
Physical and Mental Facts.—— We may, perhaps, put 
the subject matter of Psychology in a clearer light by 
contrasting mental facts with physical facts. A physical 
fact, as we know, is one open to the observation of all 
men. Trees, houses, flowers, fences—the whole of 
external nature, in a word~—are physical facts, since all 
of us can observe them with equal directness. But what 
shall we say of the brain, or any of the internal organs of 
one’s body? Are they mental facts? They are, provided | 
they are known to but one person directly, and that the 
person experiencing them. But careful reflection will con- 
vince you that no one has any direct knowledge of his 
body, a

DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF OUR BODIES. 73 
Have we Direct Knowledge of our Bodies ? — That 
we have such an organ as the heart, for example, was 
established by a process of reasoning. If we had known 
it directly, it is hard to see why the world was obliged to 
wait for Harvey to demonstrate the circulation of the 
blood— why it was not from the beginning a matter of 
direct knowledge. Strange as it may seem at first thought, 
it is pretty nearly absolutely certain that we have no direct 
knowledge of our own bodies. We learn of the existence 
of our own bodies as we do of the rest of the external 
world, by a process of reasoning. Descartes long ago said 
that if we could move the sun or moon by an effort of will, 
as we can our hands and feet, we should regard them as 
a part of our own bodies. The sole difference, so far as 
Psychology is concerned, between any external object, as 
a tree, and our bodies, is (1) that the former does not 
move in obedience to our wills, and (2) that it is not a 
source of sensations as our bodies are. I put my hand on 
a hot stove, and I have a feeling of pain. I put a stick in 
the same position, and I have no such sensation, 
How a Child Distinguishes his Body from the Rest 
of the External World. —- Any one who has ever watched 
a very young child will be quite sure that he has not dis- 
criminated his body from the rest of the external world. 
He first confuses his body with the rest of the external 
world. Little by little he comes to learn that a little piece 
of this external world sustains a very peculiar relation to 
him — that it obeys his will, moves when he wishes it to 
move, stops when he wishes it to stop, and that it is the 
direct occasion of pleasure and pain as nothing else is. 
These two facts, then, and these two facts alone, distin-
-P-A-G-E-83
74 THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
guish our bodies from the rest of the external world, so 
far as Psychology is concerned, and give us our peculiar 
interest in them. 
While this course of reasoning makes it clear that the 
internal organs of the body are not mental facts, another 
course will make it equally clear that they ave physical 
facts. Isa pencil in a drawer a physical fact? No one 
can see it. No, you say, but every one can see it if it is 
taken out of the drawer. Precisely. We need, then, to 
think of a physical fact as one open to the observation of 
all men, certain conditions being complied with. Bearing 
this in mind, we see that the various internal organs of 
the body are physical facts, because when the body is dis- 
sected they are open to the observation of all men, pre- 
cisely as is a tree or flower. 
Nature of the Mental Facts of which we are 
Conscious. —Hoping, then, that the difference between 
mental and physical facts is so clear that there will be no 
danger of confusing them, permit me to call your attention 
a little more closely to the mental facts which we are to 
study, in order that we may avoid a mistake into which 
many people fall—the mistake of supposing that any of 
the mental facts of which we are conscious are simple. 
You remember our definition of Psychology — the science 
of the facts, phenomena, or experiences, which, when we 
are conscious of them, we are conscious of as experiences 
of the mind, soul, or self. The point I wish to emphasize 
is that we are never conscious of any experience, separated | 
or detached from the mind.. As you read this, you are, 
perhaps, conscious of attending. Look into your own 
mind and see what it is you are conscious of; it is of }

yourself attending, is it not ?-—not of an abstract act of 
attention. So, also, when you perceive or remember or 
imagine or reason, what you are conscious of is not an 
abstract act of perception or memory or imagination or 
reasoning, but yourself perceiving, yourself remembering, 
yourself imagining, yourself reasoning. This, of course, is 
only another way of saying that you yourself enter as a 
constituent tnto every mental fact of which you are con- 
scious. In other words, in being conscious of mental facts, 
we are conscious of ourselves. Many writers appear to 
think that a mental fact of which we are conscious exists 
independently of the mind and separate from it, as a tree 
or a stone seems to do. But a careful looking into your 
own mind will convince you that they are mistaken; it 
will convince you that when you are conscious of a mental 
fact you are really conscious of yourself in a certain act 
or state, of yourself having a certain experience. As you 
never know the act or state or experience apart from your- 
self, so you never know yourself apart from the act or 
state or experience. Hume said that when he looked into 
his own mind he always found thoughts and feelings and 
acts of the will, but he never found anything else—he 
never found any self. Certainly not in the sense in which 
he was speaking. He was looking for a self apart from, - 
and independent of, the various thoughts, feelings, and acts 
of the will of which he was conscious, and no such self is 
to be found. The self of consciousness, I repeat, exists — 
not apart from, but as an element of, the various experi- 
ences of which we are conscious. 
Of Unconscious Mental Facts.—— You will be careful 
to note that the mental facts into which the mind enters
-P-A-G-E-85
76 THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
as a constituent are those of which we are conscious. 
I have already tried to show that mental facts exist in the 
lives of each of us of which we are not conscious; mental 
facts of the existence of which we never know save by a 
process of reasoning. Of such mental facts the mind is 
not an element, and that is precisely why we are not con- 
scious of them. The mind is conscious, or has direct 
knowledge, of only its own acts or states or modifications 
or experiences. A mental fact which is not an act or 
state or modification of the mind, the mind can learn the 
existence of only by a process of reasoning. And now I 
hope the scope of our definition of Psychology is entirely 
clear. Psychology is the science of those facts, phenomena, 
or experiences which, when we are conscious of them, we 
are conscious of as experiences of the mind, soul, or self.

LESSON IX. 
THE METHOD OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
Kinds of Mental Facts in which Psychology is Inter- 
ested.—‘‘ But in what kind of mental facts,” perhaps you 
ask, ‘‘is Psychology interested ? “IT had the toothache 
yesterday ; that, if I understand you, was a mental fact; 
but Psychology has no interest in such facts, hasit?’’ No 
and yes. That you, John Smith, had the toothache is a 
matter of indifference to Psychology. Psychology hasno 
more interest in that fact than the science of Botany has 
in the fact that you have a bed of geraniums. Like all 
sciences, its aim is general knowledge; and that you, John 
Smith, had the toothache is not general knowledge — it is 
knowledge of an individual. But when you had the tooth- 
ache, you found it difficult to study, did you not? You 
can doubtless recall many similar cases in your experience 
— cases in which severe pain interfered with that concen- 
tration of mind which we call study. And keel delight 
is just as unfavorable to study. You received a letter 
some time ago that made you very happy, so happy that 
you could not concentrate your mind on your work for 
an hour; and you find that the experience of other people 
is like yours in this regard. So, although Psychology 
cares nothing about your toothache, there is something 
oS 7
-P-A-G-E-87
78 THE METHOD OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
in the experience that it does care about. So far as 
_ your experience illustrates what ts true of all minds 
under similar circumstances, so far it ts a matter of 
interest to Psychology. 
Laws of Mind. — Or I might say that what Psychology 
especially seeks to ascertain is Jaws of mind, or of mental 
facts. A law of mental facts is a general truth about 
mental facts— something which will be true, not only in 
all your experience, but in the experience of every one 
under similar circumstances. We have just been consider- 
ing an example of a law of mental facts—that intense 
feeling, whether of pleasure or pain, can not exist along 
with concentration of mind on another subject. Thatis a 
law of mental facts, because it is true of the experiences of 
all men without exception. Since one of the conditions of 
concentration of thought— one of the things which makes 
it possible—is the absence of intense feeling, concentra- 
tion of thought, on a subject foreign to the feeling, never 
can co-exist with intense feeling. That is a perfectly 
general proposition, and, as such, illustrates a law of the 
mind. 
Evidently, then, to ascertain laws of the mind, you must 
not only study the facts of your own experience, but those 
of other people. .If you confine yourself to your own 
experience, you can not be sure that your knowledge is 
general; you are liable to confuse a personal peculiarity 
with a principle of human nature. Imagine Andrew Jack- 
son endeavoring to get a knowledge of human nature by 
studying himself alone. If he had taken himself as a type 
of men in general, he would have had very erroneous ideas 
of human nature,
-P-A-G-E-88
INTROSPECTIVE METHOD. , 79 
Introspective Method. — But can you study the minds 
of other people in the same way that you can your own? 
Try it. You often wish to know whether your pupils are 
attending to you, or whether they understand you. Can 
you find out, in the same way, that you know whether or 
not you are attending? Plainly not. You know that you 
are attending simply by looking into your own mind, and 
you can not look into the mind of any one else. The word 
which means looking into is “introspection”; and the 
adjective “introspective” seems, therefore, to describe best 
the way or mode or method in which you study your own 
mind. But you can not learn anything about the minds 
of other people in that way. When you study other people, 
you notice their looks and actions. Many teachers think 
they can tell whether their pupils are attending to them 
without asking questions. They look or act as though they 
were attending, and so the teachers who believe this con- 
clude they are. Conclude, I say. Note the word. It 
denotes a process of reasoning. And when we study the 
minds of others, we have to do it by processes of reason- 
ing — by acts of inference. 
Inferential Method.— You do not even know that 
there is any one in the world besides yourself except by a 
process of reasoning. When you say you see a man, the 
truth is that you have sensations of color, and from this 
fact infer the presence of a human being like yourself. 
When you see this human being laugh, you infer that he . 
is amused, just as you are conscious of being amused when 
you laugh. All that you learn of any human being you 
learn by reasoning —-by inference. As, then, we call the 
method of studying our own minds the ixtrospective—
-P-A-G-E-89
80 THE METHOD OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
since we study them by looking directly within-——so we 
may call the method of studying the minds of others the 
inferential, since we do it by processes of inference. 
The Inferential Method and the Study of History. — 
Whatever you learn about the minds of others — whether 
you learn it from what you see them do, or what you 
read about them— you learn by means of the inferential 
method. When you learn how Washington exposed him- 
self when Braddock’s army was routed, and at the battle 
of Princeton, you infer that he was brave, precisely as you 
would have done if you had seen him. Since all the facts 
of human history relate to the actions of men, they are 
materials which the inferential method uses to increase 
our knowledge of human nature. When we learn, for 
example, that the ancient Greeks left their weak children 
exposed, in order that they might die, the inferential 
‘method enables us to see that Greek fathers and mothers 
did not love their children as fathers and mothers love 
their children now, and that they probably loved their 
country more, since a weak child was considered of no 
worth because it gave no promise of being able to be of 
service to the State. When we know that Aristotle said 
that all that was necessary to reform or relax the manners 
of a people was to add one string to the lyre or take one 
from it, the same method enables us to see that the Greeks 
had a susceptibility to music of which we. can scarcely 
have any idea to-day. When we know that “those doughty 
old medizeval knights despised the petty clerk’s trick of 
writing, because, compared to a life of toilsome and heroic 
action, it seemed to them slavish and unmanly,” we know 
that they looked upon a very different world from ours —
-P-A-G-E-90
INFERENTIAL METHOD AND MIND STUDY. 81 
a world of different aims and ideals; that the knowledge 
we prize so highly, and toil so painfully to gain, was a thing 
of no value in their eyes. The inferential method even 
uses the relics of the prehistoric ages to add to our knowl- 
edge of men. It takes the rough tools of the cave-dwellers 
and forces from them a little knowledge of the strange 
men who used them. 
Inferential Method and the Study of our own Minds. 
— TI have said that the introspective method is the method 
we use in studying our own mental facts. That needs 
qualification. It is possible for us to study our own minds 
by means of the inferential method. People often forget 
their motives for their actions. . They say: “I do not know 
how I came to do that.” In such cases they can learn 
their motives only by means of the inferential method, 
precisely as though they were other people whose actions 
they were considering, and which they were trying to 
account for. It is doubtless true, as we shall see in a later 
chapter, that in many cases there is zo reason in the sense 
of conscious motive. Some idea suggested the action, and 
the action was straightway performed in the entire absence 
of anything that can be called reasoning. Further, the 
introspective method can only give us individual facts. 
As the bodily eye only sees isolated objects, and can not 
connect them by laws, so the eye of the mind only sees 
isolated mental facts, and can not connect them together 
by laws. In other words, we observe facts—not laws. 
Laws are the result of inference —never of, direct obser- 
vation. 
The introspective and inferential methods, then—the 
two. methods of studying mind — evidently sustain a close
-P-A-G-E-91
82 THE METHOD OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
relation to each other. You can, indeed, use the intro 
spective method without the inferential, in the mere collec- 
tion of facts; but you can not use the inferential at all 
without the introspective. When you infer that people 
have such and such mental facts under such and such cir-. 
cumstances, it is because you know by introspection that 
you have the sme mental facts under the same circum- 
stances, The laughter and tears of others would have no 
meaning to you if you had never known amusement or 
SOrrow. 
Difficulties of the Inferential Method.— Each of 
these methods has its peculiar difficulties. The results 
reached by means of the inferential method are always 
more or less uncertain. If you have ever made a thorough 
study of the history of any great man, you have doubtless 
had an excellent illustration of this. While different his- 
torians generally agree substantially as to the actions of 
men, they differ very widely in their interpretations of 
those actions. Federalist historians, and those who sym- 
pathize with them, usually regard Jefferson, for example, 
as a demagogue, while Democratic historians regard him 
as an exalted and devoted patriot. The reason of course 
is that, using the inferential method, the one explained his 
actions by one set of mental facts, the other by another. 
Illustration. — A passage in John Fiske’s The Begin- 
nings of New England gives such an excellent illustration 
of the inferential method and its difficulties that it deserves 
to be quoted at length: 
“It is difficult for the civilized man and the savage to 
understand each other. As a rule, the one does not know 
ee
-P-A-G-E-92
DIFFICULTIES OF INTROSPECTIVE METHOD. 83 
what the other is thinking about.” And then, speaking of 
Eliot, and what the Indians thought about him, the author 
goes on: “His design in founding his villages of Christian 
Indians was in the highest degree benevolent and noble, 
but the heathen Indians could hardly be expected to see 
anything in it but a cunning scheme for destroying them. 
Eliot’s converts were for the most part from the Massa- 
chusetts tribe, the smallest and weakest of all. The 
Plymouth converts came chiefly from the tribe next in 
weakness —the Pokanokets, or Wampanoags. The more 
powerful tribes — Narragansetts, Nipmucks, and Mohegans 
—furnished very few converts. When they saw the white 
intruders gathering members of the weakest tribes into 
villages of English type, and teaching them strange gods 
while clothing them in strange garments, they probably 
supposed that the pale-faces were simply adopting these 
Indians into their white tribe as a means of increasing - 
their military strength. At any rate, such a proceeding 
would be perfectly intelligible to the savage mind, whereas 
the nature of Eliot’s design lay quite beyond its ken. As 
the Indians recovered from their supernatural dread of the 
English, and began to regard them as using human means 
to accomplish their ends, they must, of course, interpret 
their conduct in such light as savage experience could 
afford. It is one of the commonest things in the world 
for a savage tribe to absorb weak neighbors by adoption, 
and thus increase its force preparatory to a deadly assault 
upon other neighbors.” 
Difficulties of the Introspective Method. — The great 
difficulty with the introspective method is that a mental 
fact vanishes as soon as you begin to examine it introspec-
-P-A-G-E-93
84 THE METHOD OF PSYCHOLOGY. 
tively. The feeling of amusement, of course, is a mental 
fact. The next time you are amused, suppose you try to 
analyze the feeling. Some psychologists say that it con- 
sists in part of a feeling of superiority. If you make a 
study of your experience to see whether they are right, 
your feeling of amusement will disappear. Or suppose 
you try to ascertain what sort of a mental fact pity is. 
When you find yourself pitying some one, if you examine 
your experience to see what pity is, the feeling will vanish. 
If the nature of flowers were such that they disappeared the 
moment one began to observe them closely, the study of 
Botany would exactly illustrate the difficulty of studying 
the mind by means of the introspective method. And as, 
in such a case, the botanist would have to content himself 
with observing his facts in the dim light of memory, so 
also must the psychologist. As his facts disappear the 
moment he begins to examine them, his only resource is 
to appeal to the memory—his introspection becomes 
retrospection, 
Study of Children. — Of course the minds that are of 
the most importance for you as teachers to study are the 
minds of children, and it is evident that you must study 
them by means of the inferential method. If you would 
get that knowledge of them that will enable you to teach 
them well, you must note their likes and dislikes, their 
amusements, their games, the books they read, the mis- 
takes they make—everything, in short, that may throw 
light on their minds. Do not rely on any knowledge of 
the mind you can get from this or any book. A good 
book on Psychology is like a guide in a strange city — 
useful chiefly in telling you where to look. But, as a guide TE A ere -

LESSON X. 
NECESSARY TRUTHS AND NECESSARY BELIEFS. 
WE would all agree that Geometry does right to state 
its axioms at the beginning. All its demonstrations depend 
upon them, and therefore it is proper that they should 
receive our attention at the outset. 
What we can Learn by Means of the Introspective 
Method. — For similar reasons it is important for us to 
ascertain as clearly as possible what we can learn by 
means of the introspective method. Since the introspec- 
tive and the inferential methods are the only methods of 
studying mental facts, and since the inferential is based 
on the introspective, what we learn by means of the intro- 
spective method lies at the foundation of our knowledge 
of mind. Jf you were building a house, you would be 
especially careful about the foundation, You would want 
it all strong and well made, but you would take particular 
pains to see that there was no flaw in the foundation. No 
matter how strong and fine and beautiful the rest of the 
house might be, you would feel that if the foundation was 
weak the whole thing might come tumbling down about 
you any day. So it behooves us to look carefully to the 
foundation of our knowledge of mind, and therefore to 
ascertain precisely what kind of knowledge we have of the 
86 
er SD: cer
-P-A-G-E-96
INTROSPECTIVE METHOD. 87 
facts known to us through introspection, and what we can 
learn by means of it. 
But the knowledge gained by introspection so closely 
resembles another kind of knowledge that the two are 
liable to be confused, unless at the outset the latter is 
clearly explained. To this end permit me, in imagination, 
to talk with you about some familiar matters. 
“Have you ever seen a stick with but one end, or a 
white crow?” 
“No,” you answer. 
“Do you think it possible that you ever will?” 
“Possible to see a white crow? Certainly there is no 
impossibility in that. I know no reason why a bird might 
not exist like the crow in every respect except the color 
of its feathers. Buta stick with one end? That is not 
merely an impossibility ; it is an absurdity. You can not 
even assert its existence.” 
“Pardon me, but I think you are mistaken. ‘This stick 
has but one end.” Have I not asserted its existence?” 
“ Apparently, but not really. You have indeed strung 
a lot of words together in the form of a sentence —a sen- 
tence to which I have no objection on the score of gram- 
mar. But there is one fatal objection to it: it does not 
mean anything.” 
“Does not mean anything? I do not understand you.” 
“Your statement does not express any action of the 
mind. All sentences that mean anything are expressions 
of thought. But when you say, ‘This stick has but one 
end,’ you have simply used your organs of speech; you 
have not though anything. I might teach a parrot to say, 
‘Kant’s arguments in defense of the antinomies of human 
reason have never been refuted.’ But what would those
-P-A-G-E-97
88 NECESSARY TRUTHS AND BELIEFS. 
words mean in the mouth of a parrot? Nothing, and that 
is all you mean when you assert the existence of a one- 
ended stick.” 
“Possibly I am stupid, but I really do not see why.” 
“ For this very simple reason: The word ‘stick’ means 
athing that hastwo'ends. When, therefore, you say, ‘This 
stick has but one end,’ it is equivalent to saying, ‘This 
two-ended thing has but one end; this thing, which has 
two ends, has but one end.’ Now it is easy enough to say 
that, but impossible to think it, is it not?” 
“T see that it is. A thing can not have two ends and 
but one end at the same time; it can not both be and 
not be.” 
Necessary Truths. — This is an example of what meta- 
physicians call necessary truths'—“a truth or law the 
opposite of which is inconceivable, contradictory, nonsensi- 
cal, impossible.’? A little reflection will enable us to 
think of many others. Two straight lines can not inclose 
a space; two- three = five; these are examples of neces- 
sary truths because the opposite of each of them is incon- 
ceivable, contradictory, nonsensical, impossible. If two 
straight lines could inclose a space, they could be straight 
and crooked at the same time; if two-three could be 
more or less than five, it could be itself and not itself at 
the same time, which is absurd, contradictory, impossible. 
To determine whether a proposition expresses a neces- 
sary truth or not, we must see if we can put any meaning 
into the proposition which contradicts it. But in apply- 
ing the test we must be on our guard against confusing 
1 These are sometimes called intuitions.

-P-A-G-E-98
NECESSARY BELIEFS. ‘ 89 
putting a meaning into the subject and predicate with put- 
ting a meaning into the proposition. “This square is 
round.” Here both subject and predicate bring up familiar 
ideas. But a moment’s reflection enables us to see that 
the intelligibleness of the subject and predicate is a very 
different thing from the intelligibleness of the proposition. 
For if the square is round, it is itself and’ not itself at the 
same time, which is unthinkable and impossible. 
Necessary Beliefs. — Let us now turn our attention to 
a class of propositions that, at first sight, look very much 
like necessary truths, but which, nevertheless, are funda- 
mentally different. You go to your room on a cold winter 
morning and begin to build a fire. ‘Why do you build a 
fire?” I ask. “Because it is cold.” “What makes you 
think that a fire will make it warmer?” “Because it did 
so yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that 
— because it always has done so in the past.” “But what 
has the past to do with the present and the future? How 
do you know that things will behave in the future as they 
have done in the past?” J can not answer the question; 
I donot believe any one can. ‘The past, as Bain says, is 
separated from the future by a chasm which no resources 
of logic will ever enable us to bridge.* 
1“The most authentic recollection gives only what Aas been, some- 
thing that has ceased and can concern us no longer. A far more perilous 
leap remains, the leap to the future, All our interest is concentrated on 
what is yet to be; the present and the past are of value only as a clue to 
the events that are to come. 
“The postulate that we are in quest of must carry us across the gulf, 
from the experienced known, either present or remembered, to the unex- 
perienced and unknown — must perform the leap of real inference. ‘ Water 
has quenched our thirst in the past; by what assumption do we affirm
-P-A-G-E-99
90 NECESSARY TRUTHS AND BELIEFS, 
But while we “can give no reason or evidence” that 
“what has been will be,” that things will behave in the 
future as they have done in the past under precisely simi- 
lar circumstances, the peculiar fact is that we do not want 
any. When we know that a thing has happened in the 
past, we are entirely sure that it will, under similar cir- 
cumstances, in the future — so sure that we can not help 
believing it even if we would. \ 
Necessity of Necessary Truths and Necessary Beliefs. 
— This is one of the reasons why we may properly call 
such beliefs necessary — the fact that we can not rid our- 
selves of them. But while they share this characteristic 
of inevitableness or necessity with necessary truths, the 
necessity in the two cases is of a very different character. 
The necessity of necessary truths is a necessity of seeing ; 
the necessity of necessary beliefs is a necessity of believ- 
ing. We know with absolute certainty that two straight 
lines can not inclose a space; we delieve with irresistible 
strength of conviction that what has been will be, under 
similar circumstances — not that it must be. We can not 
even think of two straight lines inclosing a space ; we can 
very easily think of this orderly universe becoming a chaos 
in which there would be an utter absence of law and order, 
in which combustion would be followed by heat one day, 
cold another, and so on. The necessity, then, of necessary 
beliefs is a necessity of belief, not of knowledge. We do 
that the same will happen in the future?’ Experience does not teach us 
this; experience is only what has actually been; and after ever so many 
repetitions of a thing there still remains the peril of venturing upon the 
untrodden land of future possibility, ‘What has been will be,’ justifies 
the inference that water will assuage thirst in after-times. We can give 
no reason or evidence for this uniformity.” — Bain’s Logic, p. 671.
-P-A-G-E-100
NECESSITY OF TRUTHS AND BELIEFS. gi 
not £now, strictly speaking, that the thing we believe so 
firmly is true, but we believe it with irresistible strength 
of conviction, notwithstanding. 
Some of our necessary beliefs for instance, the one 
we have been considering — have another kind of necessity. 
If we did not assume that the past would enable us to 
judge of the future, all rational action would be impossible. 
Take that belief from the minds of men, and their rational 
activities would cease as suddenly as though they had 
been transformed into stone. I eat when I am hungry, 
drink when I am thirsty, rest when I am tired do every- 
thing which I do under the influence of that belief — so 
far as my actions have any rational basis. The farmer 
sows, the mechanic builds, the lawyer prepares his brief, 
the doctor writes his prescription, because each thinks 
that a knowledge of the past enables him to anticipate 
the future more or less accurately. 
The principle, then, that what has been will be, is 
necessary not only in the sense that we can not get rid of 
it, but also in the sense that we must believe it in order to 
live in ‘the world. If a being were born in the world 
destitute of the tendency or predisposition to accept the 
past as in some sense a type of the future, he would 
necessarily perish. 
Of necessary beliefs of this class it is absurd to raise 
the question as to their truth. Though we are not pre- 
vented from questioning them by the very nature of our 
minds — as in the case of necessary truths — still, if we 
must accept them in order to act and live, the possibility 
of questioning them will remain a bare possibility. 
But if we have beliefs that are necessary in the sense 
that we can not get rid of them, but not in the sense that
-P-A-G-E-101
92 NECESSARY TRUTHS AND BELIEFS. 
we must accept them because of their practical importance, 
it is evident that the question as to their truth is altogether 
in order. A dozen different branches of science — physics, 
chemistry, physiology, astronomy, etc., as well as Psychol- 
ogy —- have shown us very clearly that many of the things 
which seem to be true—and which continue to seem to 
be after we know they are not —are false. The sun still 
seems to rise and set, although we know it does not. To 
call a halt to investigation, therefore, on the threshold of 
necessary beliefs of this character would amount to an 
attempt to protect Error against the assaults of Truth.

LESSON XI. 
WHAT ARE WE CONSCIOUS OF? 
THE object of the last lesson was to make clear the 
distinction between necessary truths and necessary beliefs. 
I tried to show that there are truths that the mind masz 
see when it clearly grasps the subject and predicate of the 
proposition that expresses them. But the mind by no 
means inevitably sees all the necessary truths it is capable 
of seeing, because there are subjects and predicates that 
are beyond its grasp at certain stages of its development, 
and others that it might grasp, but which, as a matter of 
fact, it has not grasped. _ “ Seven plus five makes twelve” 
is a necessary truth. But the child does not see it, because 
he can not grasp seven and five. A necessary truth, then, 
as not @ truth that the mind must see, but one which, 
when seen, ts seen to be necessary. 
Necessary beliefs resemble necessary truths in that we 
are not only willing, but, in a measure, forced to believe 
them, in the absence of reason and evidence. Indeed, we 
are certain both of necessary truths and necessary beliefs ; 
but our certainty differs widely in the two cases. In the 
one, it is a certainty of knowledge ; in the other, of belief. 
Moreover, the necessity of necessary beliefs, unlike that 
of necessary truths, is not in all cases absolutely unyield- 
ing in its nature. When we look through an opera-glass 
94
-P-A-G-E-104
  NATURE OF NECESSARY TRUTHS. 95 
we can not help seeming to see the object much nearer 
than it really is. Such irresistible “seemings” we call 
beliefs until we learn that they are false, but no longer. 
This is one of a multitude of instances in which what 
seems to be true is directly opposed to what we know to 
be true. It would appear, therefore, only a matter of com- 
mon prudence to accept as true only those necessary 
beliefs which we can not get along without. 
Reasons for Studying the Nature of Necessary 
Truths. — Necessary truths, necessary beliefs, and what 
we are conscious of, then, constitute the foundation of 
everything we know and believe, not only about mind, 
but about the world in general. Now that we know what 
necessary truths and necessary beliefs are, it will be com- 
paratively easy for us to determine the kind of knowledge 
that consciousness is, and the kinds of facts of which we 
are conscious. If we had attempted to learn what con- 
sciousness is before making a study of necessary truths, 
there would have been great danger of our confusing the 
knowledge of the facts that we are conscious of, with the 
knowledge of necessary truths. 
Nature of Conscious Knowledge. — Let us first try to 
ascertain what that kind of knowledge is that we call con- 
scious knowledge. or to ask what kind of facts we are 
conscious of is to ask what we know ¢u precisely the same 
way, with the same kind and degree of certainty, that we 
do the facts which every one admits we are conscious of. 
Every one admits that we are conscious of the mental 
facts we know by introspection. Evidently, in order to 
learn whether we are conscious of anything else, we need
-P-A-G-E-105
96 WHAT ARE WE CONSCIOUS OF? 
to learn whether we know anything else in the same way, 
and with the same kind and degree of certainty; we need 
to learn whether our knowledge of any other facts has the 
same characteristics as our knowledge of mental facts. 
When Columbus first came to this country, if he had been 
told that certain animals that he saw were buffaloes, he 
would have had to learn their characteristics in order to 
be able to recognize buffaloes when he saw them again. 
Knowing their characteristics, he would have been able to 
recognize a buffalo as easily as a horse or dog. In like 
manner, since we are conscious of those facts which we 
have agreed to call mental facts, we have to learn the 
characteristics of our knowledge of mental facts, in order 
to learn whether we are conscious of anything else. For 
if our knowledge of anything else has the same character- 
istics as our conscious knowledge, it also must be conscious 
knowledge. What, then, are the characteristics of the 
kind of knowledge that every one admits to be conscious 
knowledge? 
Have you ever been in pain? Suppose that, while you 
were writhing in agony, some one had asked you if you 
were sure you had any pain. How do you think you 
would have answered the question —if, indeed, you had 
possessed the patience to answer it at all? You would 
have said, I think, that your certainty was so great that it 
could be no greater. Put so much water into a glass, and 
not another drop, not an a¢om more can you make it hold. 
So, you would have said, certainty beyond or greater than 
yours it was impossible for any conscious being to have. 
“But may you not be deceived — may not your pain be a 
mere illusion, like the experiences of your dreams?” your 
questioner might have asked. “Deceived as to being in
-P-A-G-E-106
DIFFERENCE OF KNOWLEDGE. 97 - 
pain, when.T am literally writhing in agony? Wo/ I know 
it so absolutely that I know that I caz not be mistaken. 
There is much that I believe that I realize I may be mis- 
taken in. But this is certainty —certainty that admits of 
no doubt -—- certainty that makes doubt an absurdity and 
an impossibility.” Conscious knowledge, then, is abso- 
lutely certain knowledge—knowledge so certain as to 
make doubt an absurdity and an impossibility. 
Difference between Knowledge of Necessary Truths 
and Conscious Knowledge. — But this, we have seen, is 
exactly what the knowledge of necessary truths is. We 
know that two straight lines can not inclose a space so 
certainly as to make doubt an absurdity and an impos- 
sibility. Is there no difference between the knowledge of 
necessary truths and conscious knowledge? 
If we compare the attitude of our minds towards a 
necessary truth with its attitude towards a mental fact, 
I think we shail see a difference. Two straight lines can 
not inclose a space. Where? In England, on the sun, 
wherever straight lines are, we know that they can not 
inclose a space. Our knowledge is not of an individual 
fact, with which the mind seems face to face, but of an 
entire class of facts, wherever they may exist. But our 
knowledge of a pain, for example, although it is like our 
knowledge of a necessary truth in the kivd and degree of 
certainty that it gives us, differs from it in being knowledge 
of an individual fact with which the mind seems face to 
face — of which the mind seems directly aware. 
‘ Conscious knowledge, then, is absolutely certain knowl- 
edge of individual facts of which the mind seems directly ~ 
aware. Instead, then, of asking whether there are any
-P-A-G-E-107
98 WHAT ARE, WE CONSCIOUS OF? 
facts except mental facts that we are conscious of, we can 
‘put the question in this form: Are there any facts except 
mental facts with which the mind seems face to face, and 
which we know with such absolute certainty as to make 
doubt an absurdity and an impossibility ? 
Are you Conscious of the Stars? — Perhaps, some 
evening shortly after reading this lesson, you will take a 
walk. As you glance at the stars shining so brightly 
above you, you think of the subject of the lesson, and ask 
yourself if you really are conscious of them. Do you, as 
you see those little twinkling points of light in the heavens 
above you, Zzow that they exist, so certainly, so absolutely, 
as to make doubt an impossibility ? 
The fixed stars, as we know, are almost inconceivably 
far away. They are so far away that astronomers never 
think of stating their distance in miles. Instead of telling 
us their distance in miles, they tell us how long it takes 
light to travel from them tous. Now, light travels about 
180,000 miles in a second, and the nearest of the fixed 
stars is so far away that it takes light three years to come 
from it to us. Suppose, then, that the nearest fixed star 
had been destroyed two years and a half ago. Would you 
Se a er | 
see it tonight? Certainly, just as you see any other star; ! 
for the light that strikes your eyes as you look at it left it 
two years and a half ago-— six months before it was 
destroyed. And for the same reason you would see it 
to-morrow night, and the next, and so on for six months. 
Night after night for six months you would see the star 
shining above you, although it did not exist at all. When, 
then, I ask if you Avow that the stars exist as you look at 
them, evidently the most you can say is that they da,

  Are you Conscious of the Objects about you? — 
“But at any rate,” perhaps you will say, “I am conscious 
of the objects about me. I take a walk, and I see the 
beautiful’ bouquets of autumn adorning the hill-sides. Isee 
the fields stretching out before me, and here and there a 
farmer busy at work. As I mark how the leaves of the 
hedge were nipped by last night’s frost, a rabbit suddenly 
leaps from under my feet, and I wish for my gun as he 
fairly flies away from me. Surely,” you will say, “you 
will admit that I am conscious of these things.” 
Are you? Put the question to yourself. Ask yourself 
if you Znow that these things exist so absolutely that doubt 
is an impossibility. Do you like hunting? If so, I am 
sure you have dreamed of standing behind a trusty pointer, 
gun in hand, ready to take the first quail that made its 
appearance above the weeds. And while you are in the 
midst of your excitement you awake perhaps to find that 
you have neither dog nor gun —to find that you have been 
hunting only in a dream. “ What of it?” you ask. This: 
A certainty quite as great as —indeed indistinguishable 
from — your waking certainties proved untrustworthy ; 
‘may not your waking certainties be unreliable? You will 
not, of course, imagine that I doubt. that I see and hear

S i am trying to make you doubt them. I am simply trying 
’ to show that you: do-not know them with the same absolute 
certainty, that you db the mental facts of your experience, 
“and that, therefore, you are not conscious of them. 
Strongest Argument that we are not Conscious of 
Pxternal Objects. — But these arguments, conclusive as 
they seem to-me, are not the considerations which are 
entitled to most weight. Simply by looking into my own 
mind, I know that I do not know the existence of the 
objects about me with the same kind and degree of cer- 
tainty that I do the mental facts I am conscious of, and 
therefore I know that I am not conscious of them. 
Look carefully into your experience, and you will see 
that the only facts which you know with absolute certainty 
are the facts of your own mental life. You will need no 
arguments to prove that you caz not have absolute knowl- 
edge of any other individual facts — you will see that you 
do not so clearly as to make argument superfluous. But 
if you do not, permit me to ask you to hold your judgment 
in suspense until you have had more experience in the 
study of mental facts. You would take the opinion of a 
sailor as to the character of a distant object at sea in 
preference to your own, simply because of his more ex- 
tended experience. Inasmuch as trained psychologists, 
almost without exception, contend that we are not con- 
scious of the objects about us, I ask you to hold your judg- 
ment in suspense until you have studied the subject long 
enough to give you a right to an opinion. 
Not Conscious of our own Bodies. — It seems to me 
equally clear that we ama not conscious of our own bodies. |

A man with an amputated limb often feels pain in the 
amputated member, exactly as he does in any other part 
of the body. But he can not be conscious of the ampu- 
tated limb. You admit that. You admit that a man can 
not be conscious of a leg that has been buried for months. 
Well, if he seems to be conscious of the amputated mem- 
ber and is not, he has no reason to believe that he is con- 
scious of a member that is not amputated because he seems 
to be. 
I think we may conclude, therefore, that we know no 
other individual facts with the same kind and degree of 
certainty that we do the facts of which we are conscious ; 
and that, therefore, we are conscious of nothing else.

LESSON XII. 
ATTENTION. 
Sensation and Attention.— We have seen that conscious 
knowledge is that knowledge which we have of those men- 
tal facts which we know directly. We have learned also 
that there are mental facts of which we are not conscious. 
You remember the example—a student intent upon a 
book and not hearing the clock strike till a moment after. 
What is the explanation of such facts? The attention of 
the student was so fixed upon this book —his éntire con- 
sciousness was So concentrated upon it — that there was no 
consciousness left for the sensation. Thus the sensations 
of which we are conscious depend upon attention. In his 
Mental Physiology, Carpenter gives some remarkable 
examples of this. For instance: “ Before the introduction 
of chloroform, patients sometimes went through severe 
operations without giving any sign of pain, and afterwards 
declared that hey felt none: having concentrated their 
thoughts, by a powerful effort of abstraction, on some 
subject which held them engaged throughout.” “The 
writer has frequently begun a lecture, whilst suffering 
neuralgic pain so severe as to make him apprehend that 
heywould find it impossible to proceed ; yet no sooner has 
he, by a determined effort, fairly launched himself into 
‘ ‘the stream of thought than he has found himself continu- 
: 103 .
-P-A-G-E-113
104 ATTENTION. 
ously borne along without the least distraction until the 
end has come, and the attention has been released; when 
the pain has recurred with a force that has overmastered 
all resistance, making him wonder how he could have ever 
ceased to feel it.’ A similar experience in the case of Sir 
Walter Scott is thus recorded by his biographer: “John 
Ballantyne (whom Scott, while suffering under a prolonged 
and painful illness, employed as his amanuensis) told me 
that, though Scott often turned himself on his pillow with 
a groan of torment, he usually continued the sentence in 
the same breath. But when dialogue of peculiar animation 
was in progress, spirit seemed to triumph altogether over 
matter — he arose from his couch, and walked up and 
down the room, raising and lowering his voice, and, as it 
were, acting the parts.. It was in this fashion that Scott 
produced the far greater portion of the Bride of Lammer- 
moor, the whole of the Legend of Montrose, and almost 
the whole of /vazhoe.” 
Perception and Attention. —- What we perceive depends 
upon attention. Let a botanist and a geologist take the 
same walk—and the botanist will see the flowers, and 
the geologist the rocks, because each sees what he attends 
to. The next time you take a walk go along the most 
familiar road in your neighborhood, and see if you can not 
discover something new to you—some tree or shed that 
has been there all the time. I have often had that expe- 
rience. The reason is that these unperceived objects were 
not attended to. 
Memory and Attention. —What we remember depends 
upon what we attend to. Have you ever thought of it ? } 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
RECOLLECTION AND ATTENTION, 105 
Most of our past lives is a perfect Sahara of forgetfulness 
— blank, bleak, barren — swallowed up in oblivion. But 
here and there gleam little green spots of memory, little 
oases in the midst of the mighty desert of the past. How 
is this? The things which we remember are the things 
which we attend to. Talk to an old man about his past 
life, and you will find that the events of the last year he 
but dimly remembers; but when he speaks of his boy- 
hood, the incidents of the time crowd themselves upon 
him as though they had happened but yesterday. In 
that far-off happy time, when his heart was light and his 
mind was free from care, the most trivial events received 
a degree of attention sufficient to stamp them on his 
memory forever. 
* Recollection and Attention. — What we recollect 
‘aepends upon what we attend to. (Recollecting is remem- 
bering by an effort of will. All recollecting is remember- 
ing, but all remembering is not recollecting. Recollecting 
is a kind of remembering.) What do you do when you 
try to recall the name of a friend which has slipped your 
memory for the moment? You think of —attend to the 
thought of — how he looks, of his dress, of some peculiarity 
in his manner, of the first letter of his name, of some place 
where you saw him, of something connected with him — 
until, by and by, his name flashes into your mind. All 
you did, you notice, was to attend to certain thoughts in 
your mind. 
Reasoning and Attention.— What conclusions you 
reach depends upon what you attend to. To Newton, 
sitting in his garden, the fall of an apple suggested the
-P-A-G-E-115
106 ATTENTION. 
law of gravitation. Why? Because he fixed his attention 
upon the resemblance between the fall of the apple from 
the tree and the revolution of the moon around the earth. 
The chief difference between the man of great reasoning 
powers and the ordinary man is that the former notices 
remote resemblances— resemblances that escape the atten- 
tion of the latter. 
Feeling and Attention. —- What we feel depends upon 
attention. The same author already quoted from (Car- 
penter) gives some remarkable illustrations of this: The 
celebrated German mathematician, Gauss, while engaged 
in one of his most profound investigations, was interrupted 
by a servant, who told him that his wife (to whom he was 
known to be deeply attached, and who was suffering from 
a severe illness) was worse. ‘THe seemed to ear what 
was said, but either he did not comprehend it or imme--* 
diately forgot it, and went on with his work. After some 
little time, the servant came again to say that his mistress 
was much worse, and to beg that he would come to her at 
once; to which he replied: ‘I will come presently.’ Again 
he relapsed into his previous train of thought, entirely for- 
getting the intention he had expressed, most probably — 
without having distinctly realized to himself the import 
either of the communication or of his answer to it. For 
not long afterwards when the servant came again and 
assured him that his mistress was dying, and that if he did 
not come zxmediately he would probably not find her 
alive, he lifted up his head and calmly replied: ‘Tell her 
to wait until I come’ — a message he had doubtless often 
before sent when pressed by his wife’s request for his 
presence while he was similarly engaged.”
-P-A-G-E-116
VOLITION AND ATTENTION. 107 
Volition and Attention. —- What we we// likewise de- 
pends upon attention. Suppose a boy has a lesson to get, 
and another boy invites him to go fishing. Will he go or 
will he stay and get his lesson? That depends on what 
he attends to. If he allows his mind to dwell on the fun 
he will have, if he does not permit himself to think of the 
consequences of neglecting his work, he will go. But if 
he keeps his mind firmly fixed on the consequences; if he 
vividly realizes the displeasure of his parents, the disappro- 
bation of his teacher, the probability of losing his place in 
his class, he will stay. 
Importance of the Part Played by Attention in our 
Mental Life. — This brief survey will enable us to form 
some idea of the importance of the part which attention 
plays in our mental life. ; I think you see that the chief 
difference between the educated and the uneducated man 
is the greater capacity of the former for close, continuous, , 
concentrated attention. Some writers indeed have’ gone 
so far as to say that genius depends entirely on the power 
to concentrate the attention. Newton thought that the 
sole difference between himself and ordinary men consisted 
in his greater power of attention. This, I think, is an 
exaggeration. But however this may be, I think that the 
importance of training the attention can scarcely be over- 
estimated. 
Training of Attention. — How can we train the atten- 
tion of our pupils? Precisely as we cultivate any other 
power of their minds —by getting them to attend. Our 
pupils learn to observe by observing, and to think by 
thinking, and to attend by attending. We never make
-P-A-G-E-117
108 ATTENTION. 
the mistake of assuming that our pupils have a high 
degree of reasoning power when they first go to school, 
that they are capable of solving difficult problems in 
arithmetic, or understanding abstract statements in gram- 
mar; and it is just as absurd for us to suppose that 
they are capable of continuous attention, and yet we 
are prone to do that. “Because people are attentive 
when strong interest is roused” — says Edward Thring 
—“there is a common idea that attention is natural, 
and inattention a culpable fault. But the boy’s mind is 
much like a frolicking puppy, always in motion, restless, 
but never in the same position two minutes together, when 
really awake. Naturally his body partakes of this unsettled 
character. Attention is a lesson to be learned, and quite 
as much a matter of training as any other lesson. A teacher 
will be saved much useless friction if he acknowledges this 
fact, and instead of expecting attention which he will not 
get, starts at once with the intention of teaching it.” How 
can he teach it? That question is of the utmost impor- 
tance for us to be able to answer.

LESSON XIII 
ATTENTION. 
(Continued. 
Iw the last lesson I tried to make it clear that our entire | 
mental life is controlled by attention, in order that we may 
realize that the beginning of teaching is getting the atten- oh 
tion of our pupils, and that the end of education is the. . 
developing of powers of attention, and directing those 
powers into right channels. An inattentive mind is an 
absent mind; and, as Thring remarks, a teacher “might 
as well stand up and solemnly set about giving a lesson to \ 
the clothes of the class, whilst the owners were playing 
cricket, as to the so-called class” if they were inattentive. 
Moreover, as the character of the mind depends upon the 
things it attends to and the manner in which it attends to 
them, evidently the object of education is to develop the 
power of attending to the right things in the right way. 
Definition of Attention. — But what is attention ? 
When you are reading an interesting book, you are scarcely 
conscious, if at all, of the sensations of pressure produced 
by your chair; carriages and wagons are clattering along 
the street, but you do not note them; various objects are 
directly before you, but you do not see them. Indeed, you 
are but dimly conscious of the sensations produced by the 
very type of the book you are reading. But the thoughts 
110
-P-A-G-E-120
TWO KINDS OF ATTENTION. Tit 
called to your mind by your book stand out clearly and 
conspicuously in your consciousness — every feature, as it 
were, sharply defined. The act of the mind by which 
certain facts in our experience are thus emphasized and 
made prominent is called attention. <Adtention, then, may 
| be defined as that act of the mind by which we bring into 
| clear consciousness any subject or object before the mind. 
| When you say to your pupils, “Give me your attention,” 
/ you mean that you want them to stop thinking of the 
game they played at recess, of the book they read last 
night, of everything except what you are saying." 
‘2 Two Kinds of Attention. — Making another study of 
“Tour experience, we find that there are twe kinds of atten- 
tion. You are reading a difficult and not very interesting | 
book, when some one in the next room begins to sing your 
favorite song. You do your best to keep your attention 
(on your book, but your mind wanders to the song in spite 
of you. Or you go to a lecture just after reading a letter 
that contained some very good news. You try to listen to 
the lecture, but the thought of the letter persists in drag- 
ging your mind away. In both these cases you are con- 
1 Clear consciousness may be thought as the circle of those concepts” 
— experiences —“ upon which attention rests. Experience shows us that 
this circle, like the pupil of the eye, can be extended or contracted within 
certain rather wide limits. The greatest narrowing occurs when we con- 
centrate our attention upon a single object —as, for example, when we 
become absorbed in thought, or narrowly observe an outward phenom: 
enon; the greatest extension takes place when we widen the bounds of 
the narrow consciousness to its greatest extent, in which case there weuld 
be reaily no concentration of mind and no attention, It is apparent that 
the width of the circle is indirectly proportioned to the clearness of .its 
single points —7.e., that our attention is so much the less intensive the 
more extensive it is.”"— Lindner’s Psychology, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-121
112 ATTENTION, 
scious of two very different kinds of attention — attention 
depending upon the will, or voluntary attention, and atten- 
tion independent of the will, or non-voluntary attention. 
We can see the difference between them more clearly, | 
perhaps, if we bear in mind that, in the case of non-volun- | 
tary attention, there is but one thing that influences the 
mind — the thing attended te; while in voluntary attention 
there are two — the thing attended to and some reason or | 
motive for attending to it. When you listen to a song [ 
simply because you like it, you attend involuntarily; when ' 
you keep your mind fixed upon a book by an effort of willy 
you attend voluntarily. In the first case, there are but ~ 
two things concerned — your mind and the song; in the 
second, there are three — your mind and the book, and 
some reason or motive for attending to it. In the first 
case, you attend because of the attraction which the song 
has for your mind directly; in the second, you attend not 
because of any attraction which the book has for your 
mind, but because of its relation to something else that 
attracts you directly, as the desire to improve. Non-volun- 
tary attention, then, is that attention which results from 
the influence exerted upon the mind by the thing attended 
to, in and of itself; voluntary attention is that which 
results from the influence exerted upon the mind, not by 
the thing attended to, but by the knowledge of its relation 
to something else that attracts the mind in and of itself. 
Conditions of Voluntary Attention. — It is evident 
that voluntary attention is impossible without some variety 
of experience and some mental development. To attend 
voluntarily, we must pevceive relations; and to perceive 
relations, the mind must have had experience, and must
-P-A-G-E-122
CHILDREN AND VOLUNTARY ATTENTION. 113 
be developed enough to interpret that experience. A bath 
may, almost from the beginning, give a child pleasant 
sensations. But his mind must be developed enough to 
perceive the relations between the preparations for his 
bath and the bath before the sight of the former can give 
him pleasure. Moreover, it is evident that the child must 
not only have had experience of relations in order to regard 
. one thing as the sign of another; he must have not only 
¢ some development of intellect to be able to connect things 
.together, but also some development of his capacity for 
. feeling, in order to be able to form ideas of things desir- 
able in themselves. When the child is able to form the 
idea of a thing desirable in itself, and to see the connec- 
tion between such a thing and something undesirable, the 
latter begins to be interesting because of cts relation to the 
former — the conditions of voluntary attention exist. 
Very Young Children Incapable of Voluntary Atten- 
tion. — This analysis of the circumstances under which 
voluntary attention is possible prepares us to anticipate 
what observation confirms — that very young children are 
incapable of voluntary attention. Indeed, it seems prob- 
able that in the first days of a child’s life there is no atten- 
ticn of any kind. 
Mental Life of Very Young Children. — The mental 
life of a new-born child seems to consist of a mass of con- 
fused sensations, none of them coming into cledr and dis- 
tinct consciousness, because none of them are attended to. 
But the quality of some of its sensations, their character 
as pleasant or painful, causes the sensations that possess it 
to be emphasized in the chiid’s experience. Bain well says
-P-A-G-E-123
WW ~ ATTENTION. 
that “enjoyment, immediate and incessant, is a primary 
vocation of the infant mind.” \ 
Two Causes of Non-voluntary Attention. —‘“In the 
presence of the more enjoyable, the less enjoyable is dis- 
regarded.” “Attention lasts so long as enjoyment lasts, 
and no longer.”! So far as a child is under the influence 
of pleasure alone, these statements are true without quali- 
fication. But pain has fully as strong a hold on attention 
as pleasure. Moreover, as the same author remarks, “ In- 
tensity of sensation, whether pleasant or not, is a power.” 
A bright light, a loud noise, “take the attention by storm.” 
But in considering the effect of intensity of sensations 
upon attention, we must bear in mind that the greater 
their relative intensity — the greater, in other words, the 
contrast between the sensation and the other experiences 
of the child — the stronger will be its influence in attract- 
ing his attention. A remark made in an ordinary tone, for 
example, when it breaks in upon absolute stillness, will 
attract attention more strongly than one made in a very 
loud tone in the midst of noise and confusion. 
Under the influence of these two causes — the quality 
of sensations or their character as pleasurable or painful — 
and their intensity, absolute and relative, the child’s power 
of attention develops with wonderful rapidity. 
_. As long as he is capable only of non-voluntary attention, 
che is at the mercy of his impressions. As the course of a 
stream depends upon the slope of the ground, so the direc. 
tion of his attention depends upon the attractiveness of his 
sensations.

POWER OF VOLUNTARY ATTENTION. 115 
How the Power of Voluntary Attention is Developed. 
— But the exercise of non-voluntary attention develops the 
power to attend voluntarily. Every exercise of non-volun- 
tary attention makes that kind of attention easier. Sensa- 
tions less and less intense — sensations whose pleasurable 
or painful character is less and less pronounced — have 
power to attract it, in accordance with the universal law of 
the mind that exercise develops power. While the child’s 
power of non-voluntary attention is in this way increasing, 
his growing experience is leading him to form ideas of 
things he desires, and to perceive the relation between the 
things that give him pleasure and the means of gratifying 
his desires. When this relation is clearly perceived, all 
the conditions of voluntary attention exist. 
Probably the first exercise of distinctively voluntary 
attention usually occurs when the child is from three to 
six months old. 
Experiment upon a Child. — Professor Preyer reports 
an instructive experiment made by Professor Lindner upon 
his little daughter, twenty-six weeks old, which experiment 
proves conclusively that the child was exercising voluntary 
attention : 
“While the child, at this age, was taking milk as she lay 
in the cradle, the bottle took such a slant that she could not 
get anything to suck. She now tried to direct the bottle, 
with her feet, and finally raised it by means of them so dex- 
terously that she could drink conveniently. This action was 
manifestly no imitation ; it can not have depended upon a 
mere accident ; for when, at the next feeding, the bottle is 
purposely so placed that the child can not get. anything 
without the help of hands or feet, the same performance
-P-A-G-E-125
116 ATTENTION. 
takes place as before. Then, on the following day, when the 
child drinks in the same way, I prevent her from doing so 
by removing her feet from the bottle, but she at once makes 
use of them again as regulators for the flow of the milk, as 
dexterously and surely as if the feet were made on purpose 
for such use. If it follows from this that the child acts 
with deliberation long before it uses language in the proper 
sense, it also appears how imperfect and crude the delibera- 
tion is, for my child drank her milk in this awkward fashion 
for three whole months, until she at last made the discovery 
one day that, after all, the hands are much better adapted 
to service of this sort. I had given strict orders to those 
about her to let her make this advance of herself.” 
What the Experiment Proves. -— We must not forget 
to note that the conditions of voluntary attention were 
completely fulfilled in this case, and that it was only 
through this that the child’s action was possible. If the 
child had not known by experience the relation between 
certain movements and the effects of those movements, 
she would not have been able to attend to those move- 
ments—jin themselves uninteresting in order to get 
hold of her bottle. And if her experience had not enabled 
her to form an idea of her bottle as a thing that gave her 
pleasure, it would not have been possible for her to fix her 
attention upon certain “novements as a means of experi- 
encing that pleasure.

out, if it can not see clearly, the Jaws of juvenile development and 
lines of childish interests.” (a) Who are some of the great teachers

LESSON XIV. 
ATTENTION. 
(Continued, 
CompayrE says that the way to teach the child to be 
attentive is to supply the conditions of attention. Nothing 
can be truer. But in order to do this, as he remarks, we 
need to know what the conditions of attention are. 
To ascertain the conditions of non-voluntary attention 
was the object of the last lesson. We did, indeed, confine 
our investigations to the first years of childhood; but, as 
G. Stanley Hall remarks, “the living, playing, learning 
child . . . embodies a truly elementary Psychology.” If, 
then, we were right in concluding that the two laws of 
non-voluntary attention —the two conditions upon which 
it depends in childhood — are the pleasurable or painful 
character of the child’s experiences, and their intensity, 
we have reason to hope that we know the conditions that 
we need to supply in order to get non-voluntary attention, 
no matter what grade of pupils we are dealing with. 
Universal Condition of Non-voluntary Attention. —- 
I think we shall be quite sure of this if, pursuing our usual 
course, we make a study of our own experience and the 
experience of those about us. Why do you find it easier 
to listen to a speaker when you can see him than when 
118
-P-A-G-E-128
NOVELTY A NON-VOLUNTARY ATTENTION. I19 
you can not? Because when you see him you have a 
much more vivid — intense — impression of him than you 
have when you do not. Why is it that to see a dentist 
extract the tooth of a friend affects you so much more 
strongly than to ¢hzzk of the same thing? Because the 
perception of a person in pain is a much more vivid ex- 
perience than the thought of one. Why is it that pupils 
find it so much harder to attend to a teacher who speaks 
in a drawling, monotonous tone, than to one who speaks in 
a quick, lively, animated manner? Because the latter 
makes more definite impressions upon the mind. The 
monotonous speaker, moreover, is an unemphatic speaker ; 
and in the absence of emphasis ——of impressions having 
the character of intensity — there is nothing to particularly 
attract our attention to the leading idea, so that it is much 
harder to learn what that idea is. Why is it that you can 
remember an argument that you understand so much 
better than you can one that you do not understand? 
Because, when you understand an argument, you perceive 
the relations between its various parts; and the perception 
of relations is a source of pleasure, and therefore a stimulus 
of attention, and hence a help to memory. 
Novelty a Non-voluntary Attention. — It appears, 
then, that in learning the conditions of non-voluntary 
attention in the early years of a child’s life, we have 
learned what they are throughout the whole of his life. 
Some writers speak of novelty as a condition of non- 
voluntary attention, and under some circumstances it un- 
doubtedly is. But why? Because the novel is the unex- 
plained, and the unexplained excites our curiosity. But 
curiosity stimulates thought, and the exercise of the power- , 
he
-P-A-G-E-129
120 ATTENTION. 
of thinking, under normal circumstances, is a source of 
pleasure. In a word, the novel attracts our attention 
because of the pleasurable character of the experiences 
connected with it. To prove this, we only need to recall 
the fact that, when we see a novel thing under.such cir- 
cumstances as not to excite our curiosity, it does not 
attract our attention. To the mind of a man who knows 
nothing of machinery, a complicated machine, however 
novel, offers no attraction. Indeed, a man who knew 
nothing of machinery would not know, without being told, 
that a particular machine was novel, unless its new features 
were of a very striking character. His ignorance of 
machinery would make it impossible for him to see the 
difference between the novel machine and those he was in 
the habit of seeing. If its new features were of such a 
striking character that he could not fail to notice them, he 
would regard it with a sort of vague wonder, but not with 
that keen, active curiosity which is such a powerful stim- 
ulus to attention. That is why the entirely familiar and 
the entirely unknown’ are equally destitute of interest. 
Neither of them offers to the mind a problem to be solved ; 
neither of them lures to exertion with the anticipation of a 
conquest over difficulties. The entirely familiar does not 
stimulate thought, because it is, or seems to be, the entirely 
known ; the entirely unknown does not, because it offers to 
the mind nothing that it can take hold of. It is like a 
new ball of string, carefully wound up, with the ends so 
well concealed that there seems no way of beginning to 
unwind it. 
2 Of course it will be understood that I use the phrase “entirely un- 
known” relatively. Strictly speaking, the entirely unknown could not 
come before the mind at all .
-P-A-G-E-130
PHYSICAL CONDITION AND ATTENTION. 121 
Physical Condition and Non-voluntary Attention. — 
So, again, the physical conditions of attention are insisted 
on, and, as we all know by experience, with entire pro- 
priety. When you are sick or tired, you can not attend 
as you can when you are well and rested. But why? 
Because things do not interest you so much. The rela- 
tions between body and mind are so close that the mind is 
incapable of intense interest when the body is exhausted. 
That attention, then, is strongly influenced by bodily con- 
ditions is indeed true; but it is no new law: it is simply a 
case under the law already considered, that that which 
interests us, whether by its pleasurable or painful character, 
attracts attention.” 
‘We may conclude, then, that we have found what we are 
in search of, so far as non-voluntary attention is concerned 
— the conditions which we must supply in order to get it. 
-Let us now see how the case is altered by voluntary 
attention. As a matter of experience, how does the will 
influence attention ? 
Interest and Voluntary Attention. — Going to your 
room, you find a half dozen books on your table. There 
is Vanity Fair, a volume of Tennyson’s poems, Stanley’s 
Dark Continent, Looking Backward, a history of England, 
and a text-book on Geometry. Which will you read? If 
you were capable only of non-voluntary attention, you 
would read the one which attracted your attention most 
strongly. There would be a struggle between competing 
attractions, and the strongest would win the day. But 
through the influence of your will you may give your 
attention to precisely that subject which you like least. 
You do not like mathematics, but as you are going to be
-P-A-G-E-131
122 w ATTENTION, 
examined in geometry, you begin to study that. Can you 
keep your attention on it szmply by an effort of will ? 
Certainly not. The will simply determines the direction 
in which the mind looks; but if it continues to look that 
way, it must find something to interest it — something to 
attract its non-voluntary attention. The will determines, 
in this case, that the attention shall be put on geometry ; 
but if it stays thert, it is because the subject develops 
some interest for the mind — stimulates its non-voluntary 
attention. Sully puts this very clearly: “By an act of will 
I may resolve to turn my attention to something — say a 
passage in a book. But if, after this preliminary process 
of adjustment of the mental eye, the object opens up no 
interesting phase, all the willing in the world will not 
produce a calm, settled state of concentration. The will 
introduces mind and object; it can not force an attach- 
ment between them. No compulsion of attention ever 
succeeded in making a young child cordially embrace and 
appropriate, by an act of concentration, an unsuitable and 
therefore uninteresting subject. We thus see that volun- 
tary attention is not removed from the sway of interest. 
What the will does is to determine the kind of interest 
that shall prevail at the moment.” 
The Will and Voluntary Attention. — The last sen. 
tence states the work done by the will in attention very 
exactly. It creates no new influence; it simply determines 
which of pre-existing influences shall have control over the 
mind. Co-operating with a pre-existing influence, the will 
can make a weaker one prevail over a stronger. Without 
a prevailing influence to work on, the will i is as powerless 
asa lever without a fulcrum.
-P-A-G-E-132
WILL AND CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT.” 123 
But, upon second thought, have we not put this too 
strongly? Does voluntary attention always require a pre- 
existing influence in order to be effective? I do not think 
so. If the will resolutely turns the gazeof the mind upon 
a certain subject, points of interest, before unnoticed, may 
present themselves. The interest which alone makes con- 
centration of mind possible may result from the exercise 
of the will, instead of existing before it. As the persua- 
sions of a friend may induce you to consent to be intro- 
duced to a person who does not attract you, and whom you 
think you will not like, so the exertion of the will may 
induce you to attend to what you otherwise would not have 
attended to, because it revealed no attractions to such 
superficial glances as, without interest, are never given 
except in voluntary attention. Precisely as your new 
acquaintance may develop elements of attractiveness which 
you never would have known anything about if you had 
not consented to an introduction, so an uninteresting sub- 
ject may become interesting under the searching gaze of 
voluntary attention, which otherwise would have remained 
uninteresting forever. And this is one of the functions of 
voluntary attention — ‘to develop interests, to make us 
acquainted with interesting subjects, of which we should 
have otherwise remained ignorant.” “ 
The Will and Concentration of Thought. — But there 
is another function of equal importance. , What we call 
concentration of thought is a continuity of atterition to the 
same subject. But this continuity is by no means insured 
when, under the influence of the will, the interests of a 
certain subject are present to the mind. If the will relaxes 
_ its hold upon ‘the activities of the mind, the attention is 
Hy
-P-A-G-E-133
124 @ = aTTENTION. 
liable to be carried away by any one of the thousands of 
ideas that the laws of association are constantly bringing 
into our minds. As you use your will to give your atten- 
tion to geometry, although it attracts you Jess than a 
number of other subjects, so, if you really study it, you 
use your will to prevent your mind from being dragged 
away from it by the interests that are constantly importun- 
ing you. He who possesses this power in a high degree 
possesses in a high degree the power of voluntary atten- 
tion — to give steadiness to the mind, to prevent it from 
going capriciously here and there under the influence of 
the interests that happen to be present at the particular 
moment. 
If the interests of the mind are the chief condition of 
non-voluntary attention, and if voluntary attention, to have 
any educational value, must start from, or result in, inter- 
‘ests, we can put the two questions in which, as teachers, 
we. are interested, in a more definite form. What is the 
end or object of education? What is teaching? The 
of attending to the right things in the right way; to teach 
is to get and keep the attention of our pupils by bringing 
their minds into contact with subjects that have an educa- 
tional value. The one is the goal; the other seems the 
path by which we must reach it. The one is the end; 
the other seems the means by which we must attain it. 
But we now see that to develop the power to attend to the - 
right things in the right way is to develop certain perma- 
nent interests in the mind, and to give it the power to 
determine, at any particular time, the interests by which 
the current of its thoughts shall be directed. We see also 
that; fo get and keep the attention of our pupils by bring. 
we  
-P-A-G-E-134
TWO GREAT QUESTIONS FOR @EACHERS. 125 
ing their minds into contact with subjects that have an 
educational value, we must make those subjects interesting ; 
we must give their wills a fulcrum upon which to work. 
Two Great Questions for Teachers. —- We may then 
state our two great questions in this form: “(1) How can 
we develop those permanent interests that shall induce the 
mind to attend to the right things in the right way? 
(2) How can we interest our pupils in the subjects we 
teach?” Stated in this compact form, we see that we can 
not answer the first by answering the second. Life is 
larger than the school. When we have done all we can to 
make the subjects they study interesting to our pupils, the 
interests we have developed will have to compete with 
other interests, which the work of the school touches but 
indirectly and remotely. It will always remain possible 
.for their wills to choose to foster the interests that check . 
the growth of those we wish to make permanent. More- 
over, the school is larger than the recitation. There are 
other influences — discipline, for example — which we can 
bring to -bear upon the will besides those that directly 
result from the recitation. 
In adgition to these particulars there is another and 
much more important one, in which the answers to the 
two questions do not coincide. « 
Interests in Ideas and Interest in Ideals. — There are 
two radically different kinds of interests: interests in zdeas 
and interest in édea/s. In spite of what the Herbartians 
tell us, I maintain that any subject may be so taught as to 
make the interest aroused in connection with it almost, 
«altogether an interest in zdeas; and that some subjects 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
126 @ ATTENTION. 
can not be taught in such a way as to make them to any 
considerable extent a means of awakening interest in idea/s. 
Difference between them Illustrated by the Study of 
History. — Let us take history for an illustration. Taught 
in the right way, a study of it will develop in the pupil 
both kinds of interests. A pupil will be led to see the 
relation between events and their causes. He will see, for 
example, how the weak government of the Confederation 
was the natural expression of the lack of national patriotism, 
how the partialities of the Jeffersonian Republican party for 
France, in 1793, and of the Hamiltonian Federalist party 
for England, were the natural results of differences in 
temperament, surroundings and the like. This perception 
of the relation between events and their causes awakens 
an interest which illustrates what I mean by interest in 
ideas. Jt is purely éztellectual. It may be-felt by a man 
who thinks that the only mistake made by Benedict Arnold 
and Aaron Burr was in not succeeding. An interest in 
the perception of numerical relations, or of mathematical 
relations in general is of the same sort: it is an interest in 
ideas — not ideals. 
But a pupil may also get from a study of history a 
radically different kind of interest. He may be led to see 
what the patriotic self-sacrifice of men has contributed to 
the making of our country what .it is—that at every 
critical period men have been found who. preferred to 
sacrifice their private comforts to the public good. And 
such perceptions may develop in him an admiration of 
genuine patriotism, and may slowly kindle in him a resolve 
to be true to the same lofty ideals of civic worth that 
seemed to animate them. This is an interest in zdeads,
-P-A-G-E-136
DISTINCTIONS OF FACT AND OF WORTH. 127 
Distinctions of Fact and Distinctions of Worth. — 
The difference between the two may be clearly brought 
out by means of a distinction stated in Davidson’s History 
of Greek Education, one of the best books, by the way, 
on the subject of education with which I am acquainted. 
There are, says Davidson, two kinds of distinctions: dis- ° 
tinctions of fact, and distinctions of worth. We distinguish 
one thing from another thing; what is from what is not. 
Such distinctions are distinctions of fact. But sometimes 
our attention is directed to the relation between a fact and 
a certain ideal in our minds. We feel that such and such 
conduct not only was, but that it ought to have been, or 
that it was, but that it ought not to have been. Now the 
interests that grow out of distinctions of fact as such are 
interests in ideas; while the interests that grow out of 
distinctions of worth are interests in zdeads. 
This discrimination of interests in ideas from interests 
in ideals will serve its purpose if it helps us to see that no 
one has these permanent interests that induce the mind to 
attend to the right things in the right way unless he has 
interests in the right ideals as well as interests in ideas, and 
that teaching may be signally successful in awakening an 
interest-in ideas, and as signally unsuccessful in awakening 
an interest in ideals. “All the boys hated him, and yet 
they all said he was the best teacher they had ever seen.” 
A teacher of whom such a remark could be truly made 
was a good teacher only in the sense that he was success- 
ful in awakéning an interest in ideas. No teacher who 
succeeds in stimulating interest in ideals can be an object 
of dislike. In order, then, that we may do what we can to 
develop these permanent interests that shall induce our 
pupils to attend to the right things in the right way, we

must do what we can to develop an interest in ideals as 
well as an interest in ideas.

2. “A few years ago, a gentleman brought two Eskimos to 
London — he wished to amuse and at the same time to astonish them 
with the great magnificence of the metropolis. For this purpose, after 
having equipped them like English gentlemen, he took them out one 
morning to walk through the streets of London, They walked for sev- 
eral hours in silence; they expressed neither pleasure nor admiration at 
anything which they saw. When their walk was ended, they appeared 
uncommonly melancholy and stupefied. As soon as they got home,

they sat down with their elbows upon their knees and hid their faces 
between their hands. The only words they could be brought to utter 
were, *Too much smoke — too much noise — too much houses — too 
much men—too much everything!’ — Edgeworth’s Practical

mind of an orator, in the midst of an oration, is brought to bear upon 
his subject. Ideas and images not connected with it do not come to 
his mind — as though for the time he had forgotten everything in the 
world except a certain group of related facts and ideas. Is this con- 
centration of thought voluntary or involuntary attention?

LESSON XV. 
ATTENTION. 
(Continued) 
. We have seen that voluntary attention is not “removed 
from the sway of interests,” but that, to have any educa- 
tional value, it must start from or lead to interests; that 
the two functions of voluntary attention are (1) the devel- 
opment of interests in things that would never give us 
pleasure were it not for voluntary attention; and (2) the 
development of the power of continuous attention, that 
the mind may direct its own energies — that it may not be 
a mere instrument, producing nothing but inharmonious 
sounds, because played upon by every passing impulse. 
From this point of view we were able to see that the 
object of education is the development of certain perma- 
nent interests, and of the power to determine the course of 
one’s activities; also that true teaching consists in bring- 
ing the mind into contact with subjects that have an in- 
tellectual and ethical value, in such a way as to make them 
interesting. This latter, as we know, is only another way 
of saying that true teaching consists in getting and keep- 
ing the attention of our pupils, and making the right use 
of it. 
Rules for Getting Attention. — Let us begin, then, 
with the simpler question, How can we get and keep the 
130
-P-A-G-E-140
VOLUNTARY AND -NON-VOLUNTARY. 131 t 
attention of our pupils? Comenius answered that ques- 
tion with remarkable completeness nearly three hundred 
years ago. In his time it was the custom to teach boys 
separately, or not more than two or three together. He 
contended that a lecturer could hold the attention of a 
large class just as well (1) “ by always bringing before his 
pupils something pleasing and profitable; (2) by infro- 
ducing the subject of instruction in such a way as to com- 
mend it to them, or by stirring their intelligences into 
activity. by inciting questions regarding it; (3) by standing 
in a place elevated above the class, and requiring all eyes to 
be fixed on him; (4) by aiding attention through the repre- 
sentationof everything to the senses, as far as possible ; 
(5) by interrupting his instruction by frequent and perti- 
nent questions —for example, ‘What have I just said?’ 
(6) if the boy who has been asked a question should fail to 
answer, by leaping to the second, third, tenth, thirtieth, 
and asking the answer without repeating the question ; 
(7) by occasionally demanding an answer from any one in 
the whole class, and thus stirring up rivalry; (8) by giving 
an opportunity to any one to ask questions when the lesson 
is finished.” 
Voluntary and Non-voluntary Attention both Neces- 
sary.— The hastiest glance at these rules will enable us 
to see that the teacher who conforms to them supplies the 
conditions of J0¢k voluntary and non-voluntary attention ; 
and we need to carefully note the fact that we must do it 
if we hope to get and keep the attention of our pupils. 
A teacher who imagines that his work is done in this direc- 
tion when he zzéerests his pupils — in other words, when 
he supplies the conditions of non-voluntary attention — is
-P-A-G-E-141
132 ATTENTION. 
sadly mistaken. He can not get their non-voluntary atten- 
tion until he begins to interest them ; and he can not keep 
it afterwards simply by being interesting. Until he inter- 
ests them, their attention, so far as it is non-voluntary, will 
be given to the most interesting thing that happens to 
come before their minds. Afver he interests them, instead 
of keeping their attention on what he zs saying, they will 
continue to think about some interesting thing he as said, 
until their attention is attracted by something else. 
In complying with a part of the first rule —in bringing 
before our pupils something pleasing — we are evidently 
supplying the conditions of non-voluntary attention by the 
matter of our instruction ; in complying with a part of the 
second — “stirring their intelligences to activity by incit- 
ing to questions regarding it’ — we are doing the same 
thing by the axner of our instruction; and the same is 
true of the fourth and eighth rules. 
In bringing before our pupils something which they feel 
to be profitable; in teaching it so as to commend it to 
them; in occupying a position where we can see the entire 
class (a position that will make them feel that the teacher 
will be likely to know if they permit their minds to wander); 
in frequently calling upon them to reproduce what we have 
just said; in asking our questions promiscuously, without 
repeating them, when an incorrect answer is given — we 
are supplying the conditions of voluntary attention, giving 
them reasons for attending apart from the interest of the 
matter to which we wish to call their attention. 
Importance of the Fifth Rule. — Every one of these 
-tules for getting the voluntary attention of pupils is im. 
portant; but I wish especially to call attention to two or
-P-A-G-E-142
KNOWING THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE. 133 
three of them. Of the fifth I will only remark that xo 
teacher, below the university, who does not practice it 
habitually, has the attention of a majority of his pupils, no 
matter what grade of pupils he teaches. Moreover, unless 
some such rule is observed, it is hard to see how a teacher 
can be sure that his pupils understand him, We shall miss 
half of the importance of the first rule unless we bear in 
mind that when we can not see our pupils, they can not 
see us, What a hindrance that is to attention we shall 
realize if we try to listen to a speaker when we can not 
see him. 
Necessity of Knowing the Educational Value of what 
we Teach. — But it is of the first and second rules that 
I wish particularly to speak. The more I think of it, the 
more I am convinced that the neglect of them is one of 
the principal causes not only of inattention in classes, but 
of a dislike for the work of the school in general. We too 
often fail to inform ourselves of the educational value of 
the subjects we teach. It too often happens that the best 
reason we can give for teaching geography, grammar, 
arithmetic, etc., is that we were taught them. Now, when 
we do not know why we require our pupils to study this and 
that subject, is it any wonder that our pupils do not know 
why they are required to study them? Boys know very 
well that they could spend their time to advantage if they 
could use it as they liked. They could go fishing or hunt- 
ing or skating, and have lots of fun. They could work 
and get money, and have more fun. These things a boy 
knows. Is it any wonder that he does not like to go to 
school, when he has never been made to feel the value ¢f 
an education? Is it any wonder that he makes no effort
-P-A-G-E-143
134 ATTENTION. 
to keep his mind from wandering when the teacher is talk. 
ing about a lot of “stuff,” as he calls it, because he has 
never been made to appreciate its value? “Is he to sit 
and toil day by day, and let the sun shine upon hill and 
dale, and he not see it? And let it gleam along the rivers, 
and glance in and out of the forest trees with scattered 
joyousness, and he not see it? Is he to miss the freshness 
of the air, the games, and the thousand and one delights 
that pass through the kaleidoscope of the boy mind, so 
fertile in fancy, so free? And all for what?”* For 
nothing, so far as he knows, unless he has been made to 
feel the value of an education. If you expect him to work, 
if you expect him to attend to you, you must make him 
understand, so far as you can, that it is a reasonable thing 
for him to do what you require. And you must make him 
realize what knowledge costs. 
Educational Value of Geography. — Show him a map 
of Africa made twenty years ago, and show him a map of 
Africa as it is known to-day. Tell him of the toil and 
privations and hardships that. Livingstone underwent to 
make the difference. Let him know, make him feel, that 
the knowledge which he can get so easily at school is the 
“piled up” life of some of the greatest and noblest men 
of the race. It is so easy to read that “the earth is round 
because men have sailed around it.” But Drake and 
Raleigh and the other men who were among the first to 
make the voyage did it at the risk of their lives. Some of 
them, leaving pleasant homes and wives and children that 
they loved, exposed themselves to unknown dangers — the 
result of it all is a single line. : 
1 Thring’s Theory and Practice of Education,
-P-A-G-E-144
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF SCIENCE. 135 
Educational Value of Science. — It is hardly necessary 
to say that every subject we teach lends itself as readily to 
this kind of illustration as geography. Every niche, every 
arch, in that great and beneficent temple that we call 
science was put there by the toil and labor of men. Read 
how Newton first came to suppose that the fall of the 
apple and the revolution of the moon around the earth 
were due to the same cause; how he made long and labo- 
rious calculations only to find that the results of his calcu- 
lations did not correspond with his theory ; how he put his 
theory aside and found after many years that an error in 
his data had led to erroneous results, and that the results 
of his calculations from the true data were in harmony 
with his theory; or read how Kepler made hypothesis after 
hypothesis in trying to find the shape of the path of the 
planets in their revolution about the sun until at last when 
he had discovered the true one he was able to say: “I do 
think thy thoughts after Thee, O God’; read such inci- 
dents, and they will help you to understand what Fouillée 
means when he says we ought to humanize the sci- 
ences we teach: we ought, in other words, so to teach 
them as to make our pupils realize the human element 
in them —realize how they have grown and how. they 
contribute to human well-being. The tendency of such 
teaching is to interest our pupils not merely in ideas, 
but ideals; is to stimulate them to form resolves to con- 
tribute their mite to the advancement of human happiness 
and knowledge. 
But if we put Comenius’s rule fully into practice, our 
pupils will learn to value education not merely for what it 
wilt dring them, but for what it will make them. They 
realize the difference between the boy who can read and
-P-A-G-E-145
136 ATTENTION. 
one who can not. The boy who can not read.sees nothing 
but a piece of paper with black lines of ail sorts and shapes 
upon it. But the boy who can read sees not merely paper 
with letters upon it, but the very mind of the man whose 
thoughts are materialized on the page before him. Make 
him feel that he possesses other dormant, powers that you 
are trying to develop; make him feel that education will 
not merely give him better tools to use, but increase his 
power and skill in using them; make him feel that every 
lesson you assign is intended to lead to this end, and he 
will ¢ry to attend, whether he succeeds or not., 
But to insure that his efforts will be successful, we must 
give his will a fulcrum upon which to work — we must 
develop interests. 
Source of Interest. The great secret of interest is 
adaptation. The toys and playthings and pictures of a 
child amuse him because they are adapted to his state of 
development — they stimulate him to exercise his powers. 
‘What we must do in teaching, if we expect to interest our 
pupils, is to set them to do something that they are able 
to do, in order that they may acquire the power to do what 
they can not do. We should constantly be striving at 
every stage of a child’s development to learn the contents 
of his mind —to make an inventory of his capacities, so as 
to see which of them we can turn to educational account, 
and how. And here again we come upon the fact that 
meets us at every turn and corner of our experience in 
teaching —-the necessity of a constant, careful, systematic 
study of our pupils, if we hope for the best success in 
teaching them. Unless we know them choroughly, we can 
not adapt our teaching to them perfectly.

-P-A-G-E-146
LAW OF ADAPTATION, 137 
Questioning and the Law of Adaptation. — We all 
know that we can keep the attention of our pupils better 
by asking questions than we can by doing all the talking 
ourselves. The reason is found in the law of adaptation. 
When we are asking questions we are making the utmost 
use of the impulses of curiosity and activity. Children 
like to learn things, and they like to act. Ask the right 
kind of questions, and you make them conscious of their 
ignorance — you stimulate their curiosity. But here again 
the necessity of studying the minds of our pupils presents 
itself. The curiosity of little children is very different 
from that of older pupils. A child asks a question, and 
before you have answered it he asks another about an 
entirely different subject. His question was the result of 
involuntary attention ; and since his interest in things in 
the form of curiosity is very slight, like a bird he flits from 
this subject to that, never staying with one thing a minute 
at a time. But this, as we know, is one of the things 
which we want to develop — this power of attention. So 
you will try to help him attend more and more closely to a 
subject, and to follow out a line of thought more and more 
persistently. When he asks a second question before you 
have answered the first, you will neither show nor feel 
impatience, no more than a mother does that her child 
is born without teeth. You will ask him questions about 
the first thing, keeping his mind upon it as long as you 
think it safe, learning a lesson from the bird, who does not 
encourage her young to make long flights the first time. 
You will be satisfied if you can make his curiosity a means 
of getting him to think a little and learn a little, being 
sure that in this way you can deepen it, and.so.get him to 
think more closely and acquire more knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-147
138 ATTENTION. 
Power of Enthusiasm. — It is due to the same principle 
— that what is adapted to us interests us — that to pupils 
the most interesting thing is the manifestation of that | 
intense form of interest in the teacher that we call enthu- 
siasm. Arthur Sidgwick well says: “Whether it be school 
lesson or subject of common talk out of school, the enthu- 
siast drags the boy’s mind captive. He makes him attend, § 
he makes him interested, he makes him think. Without } 
trying to do so, he makes learning seem attractive and | 
delightful. Boys are naturally impressionable, and enthu- 
siasm impresses; they are naturally imitative, and what- | 
ever they see a man keen about, they at once begin to 
excite themselves about it. Whether it be poetry, history, 
‘politics, art, science, natural history, or archzology, the 
enthusiast will at once make a school of his own imitators 
about him. And he-will do far more than this. He will 
lift boy after boy out of the barbarous intellectual atmos- 
phere in which the natural boy lives and moves, and make 
him conscious — though it be only dimly conscious — of } 
the vast world of interest which lies around in every direc. ‘ 
tion, waiting till he gird up his mental loins and come to | 
explore. This is the real result of a master’s enthusiasm 
——it cultivates, Under plodding, humdrum teachers, who ; 
will not put soul into their work, a boy may pass through 
a school from bottom to top, doing all the work so as to | 
Pass muster,:and be a savage at the end. But let the 
enthusiast catch him, though but for a term, and the 
savage is converted.”? 
T can not forbear quoting what another English teacher 
says on the same subject: “To find the lesson oozing, as 
it were, from your finger tips; to be so full of your subject 
1 The Practice of Education, p. 63.  
-P-A-G-E-148
IMPORTANCE OF INTEREST IN OUR WORK. 139 
that the question is not what to say, but what to leave out ; 
and to feel so well and vigorous that your vivacity compels 
attention and interest, and makes the faces in front of you 
look bright contagiously —- kat is how to prepare the 
lesson. ... The story (told by the Professor at the Break- 
fast Table, I think) of a tailor lamenting over a customer 
departing empty-handed, that if it were not for a headache 
he would have a new coat on that back in spite of himself, 
is freighted with truth. There is a magnetic influence 
passing from a healthy and alert mind to all with whom it 
comes in contact ; that influence is the teacher’s conjuring 
wand, and without it he will never bring the dry bones of 
education to life. It will readily be seen that no patent 
process for the production or maintenance of this influence 
can be found. It is best fostered by variety of life; by a 
wide experience of men and things (not at all an easy 
thing for one so closely tied as a teacher to attain); in 
short, by anything that tends to keep the heart and mind 
open, and to make life interesting. Teachers lead too often 
very dull lives, and the dullness reacts on their pupils. 
Men and women who have to give out so much can hardly 
lead too full and rich and interesting lives. Their minds 
ought to be a storehouse of thoughts and pictures and 
recollections, from which they can draw at will to enrich 
their lessons and to furnish the minds of their pupils.” 
Importance of Interest in our Work. — It is indeed 
true that enthusiasm is a gift of nature conferred on but 
few teachers. But there is a degree of interest within the 
reach of every one of us, if we are willing to work for it. 
There is no danger that we shall lack interest in our sub- 
jects if we study them. When we think we know so much
-P-A-G-E-149
140 ATTENTION. 
about them that it is not worth while to study them any 
more, that very fact proves .that we are lacking in interest. 
But interest in our work is quite as essential as knowl- 
edge to success in teaching. '

LESSON XVI. 
ATTENTION, 
(Continued) 
In the last lesson we considered the question as to 
what we should do to keep the attention of our pupils 
during recitation. The wider question——the question as 
to the other means at our command to help us in cultivat- 
ing the power of attention — has yet to be examined. 
We learned from Comenius that one of the ways of 
keeping the attention of our pupils during recitation is to 
encourage them to ask questions; and we know that the 
reason is that in this way we stimulate their curiosity, and 
give them the pleasure of mental activity. 
Curiosity of Young Children. -—— But our observations 
of children have enabled us to see that the curiosity of 
very young pupils is not strong enough to incite them to 
hard work. ‘When they ask us questions, or when we ask 
them questions that they can not answer, if we do not 
answer them at once, they stop thinking about these 
questions, because they have so little curiosity. 
Curiosity of Older Pupils. — But when we are dealing 
- with older pupils, we should make a different use of the 
principle of curiosity. Their curiosity is strong enough 
to stimulate them to harder work. You can get their 
142
-P-A-G-E-152
CURIOSITY OF OLDER PUPILS. 143 
attention by asking questions that will make them con- 
scious of their ignorance; and the realization of this fact 
will often be a sufficient motive for vigorous exertion. 
When you should answer your question, your own tact 
must determine. It often happens that a student has 
interest enough in a subject to be clearly conscious of the 
labyrinth of difficulties in which the questions of his 
teacher have involved him, but not enough to make him 
willing to undergo the labor of threading his way out. 
Now, while we ought not to remove difficulties that have 
not been realized, or which the pupil’s interest might 
induce him to overcome, there are circumstances under 
which the clearing up of difficulties may greatly increase 
his interest, and thus put him in the way of a more vigor- 
ous and protracted exertion of his powers. When the sub- 
ject under consideration lies before his mind wrapped in 
a fog, a few direct, luminous, incisive statements from 
you may, like a brisk wind, clear away the fog and reveal 
the outlines of the country sharp and clear to your pupil’s 
mind. 
You may thus give him that experience that can be felt, 
but can not be described —that delightful consciousness 
of power which he realizes when, instead of groping in 
darkness in an unknown country, he finds himself at home, 
with a noonday’sun to guide his footsteps. His feeling of 
weakness gives place to a feeling of power. Instead of 
feeling himself overborne and beaten back by a superior 
force, he is victor, and his enemies are flying, or rather 
annihilated, before him. This delightful experience, this 
stepping from darkness into light, this transition from 
mental chaos and anarchy into a region of order and law, 
is an exceedingly powerful stimulus.
-P-A-G-E-153
144 ATTENTION, 
School Lessons. — But if you are to make the most 
of the interest excited in this or any other way in 
recitation, you must follow it up. You have asked your 
pupil a question, and set him to thinking. His thoughts 
naturally take the shape of a series of questions, and he is 
eager to get answers to them. What does he need to 
deepen his interest? Books. Or by a few well-chosen 
statements you have set his mind in order. He knew a 
lot of facts, but he saw no connection between them. His 
mind was like a house into which a lot of new furniture 
had just been tumbled — everything was everywhere, and 
nothing was anywhere. ‘Your statements have brought 
order out of chaos. You have enabled him to see that the 
various measures of Washington’s first administration were 
a part of the carefully devised plan for strengthening the 
general government that emanated from the brain of the 
great Secretary of the Treasury. He at once becomes 
interested in Hamilton. What does he need to deepen 
this interest? Books. Or your class is studying Haw- 
thorne’s The Great Stone Face. And when they have 
become thoroughly interested in the strange and beautiful 
allegory, you tell them of the man who wrote it; of the 
quaint old town in which he lived and died; of Emerson 
and Thoreau, and the other famous men who lived there ; 
you try to interest them in some of the great writers of 
American literature. But if your efforts are to result in 
any permanent deepening of their interest, they must have 
access to books. 
Without further illustration, it is plain that if you. are 
to make the most of the interest you have excited in 
recitation, you must be able to direct them to a library. 
Indeed, to develop interest in your pupils, and expect it to
-P-A-G-E-154
DISCIPLINE AND ATTENTION. 145 
be self-sustaining from the start, is as absurd as it would 
be for a farmer to take the utmost pains in preparing the 
ground, and then in planting corn, only to neglect it as 
soon as he saw the tiny blades peeping through the ground, 
with the idea that his work was then done, If the tiny 
blade is to grow into a stalk big enough to bear the golden 
grain, it must be carefully cultivated. In like manner, if 
the interest which teachers excite is to be anything more 
than a passing emotion, it must be fostered and cultivated; 
it must be fed by books. : 
«But libraries are expensive, and school committees and 
directors often refuse to buy them. What can we do in 
such a case, granting all that you say about their useful- 
ness?” You can so impress the idea of their importance 
upon the community as to see that they are got. It is 
always to be borne in mind that a library is only a collec- 
tion of books; and as any finite quantity, however small, is 
infinitely greater than zero, so any library, however small, 
is infinitely better than none. This, then, is one of the 
things which we can do to deepen the interests of our 
pupils, and so increase their power of attention. We 
can set them to reading books that will foster and 
nourish the interests that have germinated in our recita- 
tion rooms. 
Discipline and Attention. — We can help our pupils in 
the same direction by a proper system of discipline. Car- 
penter well says: “The influence of a system of discipline 
by which each individual feels himself borne along as if 
by a Fate, still more that of an instructor possessing a 
strong will, guided by sound judgment (especially when 
united with qualities that attract the affection as well as
-P-A-G-E-155
146 , ATTENTION. 
command the respect of the pupil), greatly aids him in 
learning to use that power. As Archbishop Manning has 
truly said: ‘During the earlier period of our lives the 
potentiality of our intellectual and moral nature is elicited 
by the will of others.’” The hours of study should be 
short, especially in the case of younger children. But 
during those hours they should be put at work adapted to 
. their state of development, and kept assiduously at it. No 
whispering should be allowed. The boy who whispers to 
another calls off his attention from his work —— obstructs 
. the formation of the very habit you are trying to develop, 
the habit of concentration. No disorder of any kind should 
be tolerated. With the utmost kindness, and at the same 
time with the utmost firmness, your pupils should be made 
to feel that the hours for study are for study. As.soon as 
they can understand them, you should show them the 
reason for your requirements. You should make them feel 
that, in obeying you, they are obeying reason, and not 
arbitrary will. You should make them feel that you 
require what you require because you must, because you 
would be false to the trust reposed in you by the com- 
munity unless you did. You should make them feel that 
they and you are associated together as pupils and teacher 
for the accomplishment of a definite purpose, and that 
whatever they or you need to do in order to accomplish 
that purpose must be done, that you no less than they 
have no choice but to do it. And when they can appreciate 
the truth of that noteworthy saying of Locke’s, “ The 
foundation of all virtue and worth consists in the ability to 
cross one’s inclinations and follow the dictates of reason,” 
you have in their own desire to reach a high ideal a power.

-P-A-G-E-156
SCHOOL PROGRAMMES. 147 
School Programmes. — It would doubtless be possible 
to assist pupils to develop powers of concentration by a judi- 
cious arrangement of school programmes. A programme 
which requires the hardest work when the pupil is least 
capable of working vigorously makes attention unneces- 
sarily difficult. But it is not possible to say in detail what 
a judicious programme is, because the question as to the 
relative intellectual capacities of pupils at different hours 
of the day has not yet been answered. To say that pupils 
should be required to do the hardest work when they are 
most capable of vigorous mental work, and the easiest, 
when they are least capable, does not take us a step nearer 
the making of a good programme unless we know when 
they are most, and when they are feast, capable of doing 
mental work. Even if this were known, — and it is not, — 
the problem would be complicated by the fact that what 
one pupil finds difficult, another finds easy, and the reverse. 
It is an easy solution of the question to conclude that, 
because voluntary muscular energy undergoes certain 
fluctuations in the twenty hours, therefore, intellectual 
energy does, and without further ceremony to decide that 
the hours of greatest voluntary muscular energy are also 
those of greatest intellectual energy. But such solutions 
have nothing to recommend them except their simplicity. 
‘We may be sure that there is no short, high and dry 
cut to the goal we wish to reach. We shall learn what 
the ideally best programme isin case there is such a 
programme — only by careful experiments conducted 
on a large scale, only by studying the conditions under 
which our pupils seem to do their work most easily, and 
by utilizing the results of other students in the same 
field.
-P-A-G-E-157
148 ATTENTION. 
Explanation of Inattention. — Finally, we should never 
permit ourselves to resort to “laziness” or “stupidity” to 
account for inattention as long as any other explanation is 
possible. I have already quoted that profound observation 
of Pestalozzi, “If our pupils are inattentive, we should 
first look to ourselves for the reason.” Any teacher who 
earnestly tries to follow Pestalozzi’s injunction will be sur- 
prised to find in how large a number of cases inattention 
and lack of interest on the part of his pupils are due to 
causes which he can remove. Sometimes a boy is in- 
attentive because he does not see the practical value of 
the work he is set to doing; sometimes because he does 
not understand certain fundamental ideas which, being in 
darkness, necessarily darken the entire subject ; sometimes 
also— sad to relate — because the teacher, by sarcastic 
‘and satirical remarks, has excited the boy’s dislike. Grown 
people are sometimes guilty of “cutting off their noses to 
spite their faces,” and boys very often. And when a 
teacher indulges in sarcasm at the expense of his pupils, 
they are very likely to slight their work as much as they 
can, even when they know they are injuring themselves, 
because he wants them to do it Get the good will of 
your pupils if you wish to get their attention. 
1“Many a boy will sit and seem stolid, and all the while resent your 
satire with exasperation. You can not tell a sensitive boy by his look. 
He is not the shy, dark-eyed creature of the school tales. He may just 
as likely be a ruddy, high-spirited person, or a brawny athlete, or an ugly, 
lumpy log of a boy. And the satire may often be unjust. And, just or 
unjust, nineteen boys out of twenty hate it. The worst mistake of all is 
to use it among small boys. . . . When they are ignorant, or inattentive, 
or stupid, he (the teacher) begins to be sarcastic—ze., to show a far 
worse ignorance and stupidity than theirs.” Ze Practice of Education,

UNINTERESTING AND INTERESTING WORK. 149 
Connect Uninteresting Work with Interesting. — 
Sometimes also pupils are inattentive because the facts of 
the subject have no natural interest for them, and have 
never been connected with anything that is interesting. 
No observer of children has failed to notice that things 
devoid of interest may become interesting by being con-. 
nected with something that is interesting. 
Revolution in Primary Teaching. — The revolution 
that is taking place in the primary teaching of this country 
is based at the outset on this fact. When children start to 
school, they are already interested in nature — in the bugs, 
butterflies, grasshoppers, birds, trees, plants and flowers 
with which they are familiar. They are also interested in 
such stories as come within the range of their comprehen- 
sion — stories about animals, fairy stories, stories of ad- 
venture and the like. The business of the primary teacher 
is to work these interests for all they are worth — to grad- 
ually develop the interest in nature into an interest in 
science, and the interest in stories into an interest in liter- 
ature and history, and also to connect these interests with 
the other work of the school in such a way that it may be 
done in the most economic manner possible. To this end, 
the reading, writing, spelling, drawing, number and lan- 
guage work should be connected with the study of nature 
and stories to as large an extent as possible. Reading for 
the sake of pronouncing words is a stupid task — suitable 
only to a parrot. But reading for the sake of acquiring 
information about something the pupil is already interested 
in is a delightful labor. Writing for the sake of imitating 
a copy is uninteresting. But writing for the sake of giving 
expression to interesting thoughts is a pleasure. What
-P-A-G-E-159
150 ATTENTION. 
child of seven or eight cares what six times twenty-two 
make? But when he and five companions each sees twenty- 
two red-winged grasshoppers on a given excursion, the ques- 
tion as to how many they have all seen is an entirely differ- 
ent one. What child cares to draw a mere figure, or some 
object taken to the school just for the sake of being drawn ? 
* But what child does not take an interest in drawing if he 
is asked to put on paper his ideas of a certain scene, or to 
represent, as he sees it, an object he is already interested in? 
These illustrations might be continued indefinitely. But 
they will serve their purpose if they show how the interest 
of interesting work may be carried over to uninteresting 
work, and how all the work of the school may in this way 
be made interesting. It ought to be noted also that such 
work deepens the interest in, and the value of, the work 
that is already interesting. A child who draws a scene as 
it is in his mind, or an object as he sees it, cares more 
about the scene and the object than he did before he drew 
them. When he has read a story about an animal he is 
interested in, he is more interested in it than he was 
before. When he has used numbers to learn how many 
objects of a certain class he has seen, or what. proportion 
one class forms to another class, the greater definiteness of 
his ideas is a source of pleasure. By connecting, then, 
the interesting work of the school with that which would 
otherwise be uninteresting, the uninteresting work not 
only becomes interesting — it adds to the value, and inten- 
sifies the interest, of the work that is already interesting. 
Individuality of Pupils and Inattention. — Sometimes

Darwin was counted a very dull boy, and I think it quite 
likely that the same opinion was held of Edison, The 
trouble, of course, was not with Darwin, but with his 
teachers. He had a strong bent towards the study of 
nature, and they wanted to teach him Latin and Greek, 
and make him memorize books about nature. If his teachers 
had practiced Pestalozzi’s injunction, this dull boy might 
have been transformed into the most interesting and

LESSON XVII. 
KNOWING, FEELING, AND WILLING. 
In studying our experience in order to ascertain the 
nature and laws of attention, we have already observed 
three fundamentally different classes of mental facts. We 
have seen that what we perceive, remember, recollect, and 
believe—-as the result of reasoning——depends on what 
we attend to. But all these acts of mind (perception, 
memory, recollection, and reasoning) are alike forms of 
knowledge. 
Two Kinds of Knowledge. — Perception gives us what 
seems to be immediate or direct knowledge of external 
objects —trees, houses, fences, and the like; memory, 
direct knowledge of past objects and events; reasoning, 
mediate or indirect knowledge of objects and events and 
laws— past, present, and future. They differ, then, in 
the kinds of facts of which they tell us, and the way in 
which they tell us about them. Perception tells us of the 
present directly; memory, of the fast directly ; reasoning, 
of past, present, and future zzdirectly. But they agree in 
being forms or kinds of knowledge. What we perceive, 
and what we remember, and what we learn by reasoning, 
we alike know, provided there has been no mistake in the 
processes. 
152
-P-A-G-E-162
KNOWLEDGE AND FEELING, 153 
Relation between Knowledge and Feeling. — But we 
have seen that what we perceive, remember, etc., depends 
on what interests us — on what gives us pleasure and pain. 
This interest——this pleasure and pain——-is a fundamen- 
tally different fact from knowledge. Acts of knowing are 
indeed usually accompanied by pleasure or pain; but the 
knowing is one thing, the pleasure or pain quite another. 
We shall see this clearly if we consider the effect the 
knowledge of the same fact produces on different minds, 
or the same mind under different circumstances. One’ 
man reads an account of a death; it produces no effect, 
because the dead man was an entire stranger. Another 
reads it and is prostrated with grief; the dead man was 
his son. Or you drop your purse, and you see it lying on 
the ground, as you stoop to pick it up, with no feeling 
either of pleasure or pain. But if you see it after you 
have lost it and have hunted for it a long time in vain, 
you have a pronounced feeling of pleasure. 
Different Forms of Feeling.— All forms of pleasure 
and pain are called feelings. Between the pleasure which 
comes from eating a peach and that which results from 
solving a difficult problem, or learning good news of a 
friend, or thinking of the progress of civilization — be- 
tween the pain that results from a cut in the hand and 
that which results from the failure of a long-cherished plan 
or the death of a friend —,there is along distance. But the 
one group are all pleasures ; the other, all pains. And what- 
ever the source of the pleasure or pain, it is alike feeling. 
Willing Discriminated from Knowing and Feeling. — 
We saw, also, in studying attention, that “it often requires
-P-A-G-E-163
154 " KNOWING, FEELING, AND WILLING, 
hard work to take our minds from some subject that 
strongly attracts it. That effort is an example of w7/ling. 
We can easily distinguish w7//ing from both knowing and 
feeling. The boy who is invited to go skating when he 
has a lesson to get has a perfectly definite idea — knowl- 
edge —of what he is invited to do. That idea gives him 
a longing to go — feeling — but he does not decide — will 
—todoit. He wishes to get his lesson; the thought of 
leaving it unlearned gives him a form of pain. And so, 
between the anticipations of the pleasure the skating would 
give him and the pain he feels at thinking of leaving his 
lesson unlearned, he is undecided for some minutes— he 
wills neither to go nor not to go. Presently he decides — 
wills.. He says, “I will go,” and immediately makes 
preparations to start; or, “I will not go,” and resolutely 
attempts to put all thought of skating out of his mind. 
No matter what you do— whether you walk, sing, talk, 
jump, think of this or that——the act of the mind which 
initiates your activity, provided there is such an act — 
which is not always the case — is an act of the will. 
Relation of Knowing, Feeling, and Willing to the 
Self. — These three classes of facts are all experiences of 
the same mind or self. You say, “/ know, J feel, / will,” 
and you say rightly. The self that knows is the self that 
feels and wills. Still it is convenient to have nanjes that 
denote particular groups of these activities of the mind. 
As it saves circumlocution to have one name to denote 
the business of a man-——farmer-—and another his party 
ties — Republican — although the same man is both farmer ~ 
and Republican, so we speak of the mind as zz¢e/lect when 
we think of it as possessing and exercising the power to
-P-A-G-E-164
1 
OPPOSITION OF KNOWING AND WILLING. 155 
know ; sensibility, when we think of it as possessing and 
exercising the power to feel; w7//, when we think of it as 
possessing and exercising the power to will. But it is the 
one indivisible mind that is intellect, sensibility, and will. 
We shall find upon observation that the mind does 
nothing but know, feel, and will. Probably you do not like 
to call that act of the mind by which it reaches a false 
conclusion an act of knowledge, and it is not as the word 
is popularly used. But, as a mental fact, what is the 
difference between the aét of the mind by which it reaches 
a true conclusion and that by which it reaches ene that is 
false? None whatever, in many cases. A child sees an 
old man with white whiskers, and is told that they were 
black when he was young. Her papa has black whiskers, 
and so she asks: “Papa, were your whiskers white when 
you were young?” Her conclusion is false, and yet her 
mental process is exactly like many that lead her to con- 
clusions that are true. So also memory often misleads, 
and we ve often think we perceive what does not exist. But 
as mental facts there is no difference between memory 
that deceives and memory that tells the truth —— between 
acts of perception that correspond with external objects 
and those that do not. 
Although intellect, sensibility, and will are but different 
names of the one mind, as feeling and willing and know- 
ing, there is scarcely a moment in our waking hours when 
we are not doing all three at the same time. Examine 
our minds when we will, and we shall always find ourselves 
knowing, and generally fecling and willing. 
Opposition of Knowing, Feeling, and Willing. — Never- 
theless we can not know intensely and feel or will in-
-P-A-G-E-165
156 KNOWING, FEELING, AND WILLING. 
tensely at the same time; or feel intensely, and know or 
will intensely at the same time. 
Some of the illustrations of the effects of attention will 
serve to illustrate this law of the mind also. When Car- 
penter was engaged in lecturing, he forgot his pain. Why? 
Because pain is a feeling; and when he was lecturing he 
was exercising his powers to know very vigorously. A mad 
man is an insane man — one whose knowing powers are 
disarranged. Why is it that we sometimes call an angry 
man mad? Because anger is a state of intense feeling, 
and a man in such a state often does as foolish things as 
though he were insane. The expression “wild with grief” 
has a similar significance, illustrates the same law. You 
have noticed also that you do not make much progress in 
those studies which interest you so little as to make it 
necessary for you to put forth a great deal of effort to 
Rep your mind on them. Why? Because you have 
to will so energetically to concentrate your attention that 
there is little energy left for knowing. 
The practical rules which are based upon this law are 
so evident that it is needless to enlarge upon them. You 
know that when your pupils are amused they do not study 
much, because amusement — a pleasurable feeling — is a 
hindrance to that concentration of mind which we call 
study —- knowing. 
The law that I have been illustrating is called the opposz- 
tion or antagonism of knowing, feeling, and willing. 
Interdependence of Knowing, Feeling, and Willing. —— 
Notwithstanding this opposition, there is an interdepend-~ 
ence of knowing, feeling, and willing. When you hurt 
your hand — feeling — you know that you hurt it, and you
-P-A-G-E-166
IMPORTANCE TO THE TEACHER, 157 
try to relieve the pain — willing. Sometimes you have 
what you call the “blues” — you feel depressed without 
knowing why. Apart from that case, and bodily pleasures 
and pains, all feeling depends upon knowing. What angers 
you or grieves you? Something you know. When your 
so-called friends backbite you, it does not affect you until 
you know it; the misfortune that overtakes your absent 
friends does not trouble you until the news has reached 
you. The dependence of knowing on feeling I have illus- 
strated at length in the lesson on attention. I tried to 
show how necessary interest is to attention, and that is 
only another way of stating the dependence of knowing, so 
far as it results from involuntary attention, upon feeling. 
The facts of voluntary attention again illustrate the de- 
pendence of the will on feeling. I will to do this or that 
because of some pleasure or benefit—-and that, when 
analyzed, will be found to consist of some form of pleasure 
which I hope to gain, or of some pain which I hope to 
avoid. 
Importance of this Fact to the. Teacher. — This fact of 
the interdependence of knowing, feeling, and willing is, as 
we know,.of cardinal importance to the teacher. Teachers 
are coming to feel the importance of knowing the contents 
of their pupils’ minds, in order that they may adapt their 
teaching to them. To go from the known to the unknown 
is to make what the pupil knows a starting-point from 
which to lead him to something he does not know. Plainly 
any attempt to explain the unknown will be a failure un- 
less the explanation is made in terms known to the pupil. 
For this reason intelligent teachers are always trying to : 
make a map of their pupils’ minds, that they may learn
-P-A-G-E-167
158 KNOWING, FEELING, AND WILLING. 
what points they can help their pupils to start from in 
making excursions into the unknown. 
But there is another fact just as important which we are 
more likely to overlook. When you have arranged an ex- 
cursion, there is something else you must do before you 
can be sure it will be a success; you must see to it that 
people have a sufficient motive to go on it. So also, when 
you have planned a mental excursion for your pupils, 
when you have found a place from which they can start, 
before you can be sure of their company, you must be sure 
that they have a sufficient motive for going with you. 
Dropping the figure, it is not enough for you to explain 
things so that your pupils caz understand you; you must 
see to it that they have a motive to make the neces- 
vsary exertion. What wind is to a sailing vessel, and 
water to a water-mill, and steam to a steam-engine, that 
motives —feelings of some sort — are to all intellectual 
‘activity. It is not enough to build railroads and cars and 
steam-engines ; coal must be mined and water must be 
converted into steam, or the cars will never leave the 
depot. 
Mistake of the Herbartians. — But I do not mean to 
intimate that izterest is the only motive to which the 
teacher can appeal. Far from it. This mistake, as I 
deem it, is the fundamental error of the Herbartians. 
Following in the footsteps of their master, they undertake 
to construct a philosophy of education in which no place 
is left for the action of the will, and in which there is no 
need of any. As I apprehend it, education is the process 
by which a pupil is gradually elevated from a condition in 
which he is governed by the interests pertaining to sense,
-P-A-G-E-168
WHICH IS A GOOD SCHOOL? 159 
to the interests pertaining to reason. But this elevation 
is not possible except through a constant appeal to the 
will. The office of the will is not to compel the mind to 
any line of activity in the absence of interests — that would 
be impossible — but of two or more interests before the 
mind at any moment, to choose between them in harmony 
with the conclusions of reason. 
Which is a Good School ? — The clear perception of 
the necessity of motives and of the enormous difference in 
the educational value of the motives which you may em- 
ploy, will give you a new test for determining the excel- 
lence of a school. You go into a school; the order is 
excellent, the lessons well prepared. You say, “That’s a 
good school.” But can you be sure of that without further 
examination? You know indeed that good results are 
reached ; but before-you'can decide as to the character of 
the school, you must know what means are employed to 
reach them— you must know what motives the teacher 
appeals to. Are the pupils quiet simply through fear? 
Then all we can say is that the school has one element of 
a good school — order — but that the wrong motives are 
relied on to get it. Do they learn their lessons to avoid 
punishment? Then again I say the wrong motives are 
appealed to. Good teaching appeals to motives that will 
tend to make pupils studious through life. How long will 
the fear of punishment influence pupils? *As long as there 
is a teacher to inflict punishment. Indeed, as we have 
seen, it is not enough to make instruction interesting. 
Volkman well says that the precept of modern pedagogy 
is, “Instruct in such a way that an interest may awake 
and remain active for life.”
-P-A-G-E-169
160 KNOWING, FEELING, AND WILLING. 
Emulation. —The question as to how far emulation 
should be appealed to is undoubtedly difficult, but it 
is safe to say that it is not to be condemned alto- 
gether, as some theorists and idealists would have it. 
Where it is used to stimulate the idle as well as the 
industrious, the weak as well as the strong, it is an 
altogether proper and valuable motive to appeal to. In 
that suggestive and stimulating book, Educational Re- 
formers, the author, Mr. Quick, gives an interesting and 
instructive illustration of some excellent work which the 
principle of emulation may be made todo. “Let me tell 
you,” he says in an imaginary conversation with a friend, 
“of one form of stimulus which seemed to work well and 
was free from most of the objections you are thinking of. 
When I had a small school of my own, in which-there 
were only young boys, I put up in the school-room a list 
of the boys’ names, in alphabetical order, with blank 
spaces after the names. I looked over the boys’ written 
work very carefully, and whenever I came across any 
. written exercise evidently done with great painstaking, 
and, for that boy, with more than ordinary success, I 
marked it with a G, and I put the G in one of the spaces 
after that boy’s name in the list hung up in the school- 
room. When the school collectively had a fixed number 
of G’s, we had an extra half-holiday. The announcement 
of a G was therefore always hailed with delight.” — P. 530, 
Rev. Ed. . 
This method tended to make the boy emulate his past 
self, and that was its chief excellence. It was not the 
merit of a boy’s work, in comparison with the work of 
other boys, that won a G, but the merit in comparison 
with his own past performances. But I do not mean to
-P-A-G-E-170
QUESTIONS. | 161 
imply that it is never proper to try to get our pupils to 
work by inducing them to try to excel each other. Far 
from it. A boy who feels that he is a blockhead thinks 
that it is not worth while for him to try to do anything. 
Each pupil should be made to feel that there is some 
thing in which he can excel, and we should regard it as 
one of our most important duties to try to help him to 
find what that thing is. We should therefore always be 
on the alert to detect any signs of excellence in the work 
of the dull boys and girls, and be quick to commend it. 
I have already spoken of a boy who could not spell one 
word in four in a spelling lesson after hours of study. But 
he was excellent in arithmetic, and it was altogether 
proper for his teacher to praise his work in that subject as 
highly as it would bear.

LESSON XVIII. 
SENSATION. 
In the last lesson we picked out the threads of which 
the tangled web of our conscious life is composed. We 
learned that, no matter what subject stands in the centre 
of the field of consciousness— whether the toys of the 
child, the games of the boy, the ambitions of the young 
man, the absorbing occupations of maturity, or the retro- 
spective reveries of old age-—our entire mental life con- 
sists of knowing, feeling, and willing. 
If my object were to discuss, even in a superficial way, 
these various phases of our mental life, it would be proper 
now to try to ascertain the strands of which these threads 
are composed, and show how they were twisted into their 
present form in our experience —to break up the complex 
forms of knowing, feeling, and willing, of which we are 
conscious, into their elements, and then trace their growth 
from their feeble beginnings up to the forms in which we 
find them. 
But I have no such purpose. I intend from this point 
to confine myself to the intellectual or knowing side of the 
mental lite, and to those phases of it that have most inter- 
est for us as teachers. But even here lack of space pre- 
vents me from pursuing a strictly logical course —from 
163
-P-A-G-E-173
164 SENSATION. 
trying to break up the complex forms of knowing of which 
we are conscious, in order to ascertain their elements. . 
Fortunately, however, we can be sure of some of those 
elements, at any rate, without any elaborate analysis. It 
is easy to see that we should never know anything of the 
objects about us were it not for their action upon the 
senses. We see that persons born blind have no ideas of 
colors—-that those born deaf have no ideas of sounds; 
_and it is evident that, if a being were born without any of 
the senses, he would remain in absolute ignorance of the 
~ external world, even supposing it were possible for him ta 
have any mental life at all. 
Antecedents of Sensations. — We can be sure, then, 
that sensations are a part, at any rate, of the elements of 
which our intellectual life is composed. Evidently, there- 
fore, in discussing the intellect, the subjett to begin with 
is sensation. 
But what is a sensation? If you ever watched a hunter, 
at a little distance from you,.in the act of firing at a bird, 
you doubtless noticed that you saw the smoke before you 
heard the report of his gun. The reason is, you say, that, 
as sound does not travel as fast as light, you saw the 
smoke before you heard the report, because the sound was 
outstripped in the race. But what do you mean when you 
say that sound travels? Surely not that the sensation 
traveled, because there was no sensation there. Vibrations 
of air alone were there —not sensations. The only imme. 
diate result of the firing of the gun was a rapid change in 
the position of the particles of air—-not sound at all, but 
something which we’ could see if air were visible, and it 
the eye were quick and keen enough to follow its rapid
-P-A-G-E-174
THESE ANTECEDENTS ARE PHYSICAL FACTS, 165 
changes. ‘These vibrations of air do indeed travel in such 
cases; and as we in imagination follow them as they 
radiate from the hunter as a centre, we can realize that 
what we are following is not sensation, but motion. . Pres- 
ently, by means of the mechanism of the organ of hearing, 
they.reach the terminal fibres of the auditory nerve. Still 
there is only motion. The vibrating particles of air cause 
a change in the. particles in these terminal fibres, and 
these in the particles next to them, and so on, until the 
brain centre is reached. Still we have nothing but motion. 
But the change in the brain centre is followed by some- 
thing that is not motion— by that unique mental fact 
which we call a sensation of sound. 
These Antecedents are Physical Facts.— You remem- 
ber that a mental fact is one known or knowable by but 
one person ditectly, while a physical fact may be known 
by any number of persons — certain conditions being com- 
plied with. Evidently all the antecedents of the sensation 
of sound which we have considered are physical facts. 
The firing of a gun is a physical fact, since any number 
of people can see it at the same time. Although we can 
not say as much of the vibrating air, the reason is wot 
because of the nature of the fact, but because of defects in 
our senses. Jf our senses were more acute, a large num- 
ber of people might feel the vibrations of the air that 
result from the firing of a gun, and hence it is a physical 
fact. So also of the next antecedent, the changes in the 
auditory nerve produced by the vibrations of the air. Of 
course no one has ever seen them, because, in the first 
place, the nerve itself can not be seen; and in the second 
place, if it could, its particles are so exceedingly small that 
lige
-P-A-G-E-175
166 SENSATION, 
_no changes in them could be seen. But here again the 
reason is not because of the nature of the fact, but of the 
conditions under which it exists, and of defects in our 
senses. Plainly the same is true of the changes in the 
brain, which, like those in the auditory nerve, are physical 
facts. But directly after these changes in the brain-—— 
perhaps, indeed, contemporaneous with them—-a fact 
occurs utterly unlike the series of facts that preceded it — 
a fact which, because of its very nature, is knowable only 
by the person experiencing it—-and that fact is the sen- 
sation. 
Suppose that the stars had been blotted out of existence, 
and that they began to exist again while you were looking 
up at the sky on a dark night, would they immediately 
give you a sensation of sight? Certainly not. The waves 
of light would travel for years before they reach your eyes, 
and even then there would be no sensation. The changes 
in the retina of your eye would have to be communicated 
to the optic nerve, and then to the brain centre, before 
there could be a sensation. 
The Four Antecedents. — These examples enable us to 
distinguish the several antecedents that precéde sensation :* 
1. An exciting cause — something to produce a chatige 
in the ends of the nerves. 
2, The action of this cause upon the nerves. Vibrating 
air that does not reach the auditory nerve does not tend to © 
produce a sensation of sound. 
3. That change which takes place in the nerves in con- 
sequence of the effect produced by the exciting cause upon. 
the particles of the nerve with which it comes in contact. 
1 See Lindner’s Psychology, p. 32.
-P-A-G-E-176
WHICH CAN BE DISPENSED WITH? 167 
What the nature of that change is no one knows, except 
that it is some kind of motion. You have often seen boys 
. stand a lot of bricks in a row, so that when one was pushed 
down it fell against the next, and it against the one next it, 
until all were thrown down. Spencer compares the effect 
produced by a falling brick upon the rest of the row in the 
above case to the effect produced by the change in the 
particles of the end of the nerve upon the rest of them — 
not, of course, with the idea that there is any real resem- 
blance in the two cases, but in opder to help us imagine 
how a change in one part of the nerve might be communi- 
cated to the whole of it. 
4. The change in the brain centre in consequence of 
this change in the nerve. 
Which of those can be Dispensed with ? — Inasmuch 
as it is this change that immediately precedes and occa- 
sions or conditions the sensation, we would naturally 
suppose that, if there were any way of producing it 
without stimulating the nerve that leads to it, the same 
sensation would exist that ordinarily results from stimu- 
lating the nerve. The usual method of ringing a bell 
is by pulling the bell-rope.t. But as the sole utility of 
pulling the rope is to make the bell swing, so that its 
tongue may strike against its sides, and as the bell will 
ring just as well when from any other cause its tongue 
is put in motion, so we would suppose that, inasmuch as 
the sole function of the nerves leading to the brain in 
causing sensation is to cause a change in the brain centres, 
if in any way that change is produced without the agency 
of the nerve, the sensations would exist all the same. 
1 This illustration was suggested by one used by Taine.
-P-A-G-E-177
168 SENSATION. 
There are many facts indicating that this supposition 
is true. 
Blindfolded Chess-players. — It is well known that 
many chess-players can play with great skill with their 
eyes closed and their faces turned towards the wall. A 
man who possessed this power in a high degree gave the 
following account of it: “When I am in my corner, facing 
the wall, I see simultaneously the chess-board and all the 
pieces as they were in reality after the last move; and as 
each piece is moved I see the whole chess-board, with the 
new change effected. . . . It is far easier to deceive me 
when I watch the board than otherwise; in fact, when 
I am in my corner, I defy any one to mislead me as to the 
position of a piece without my afterwards detecting it... . 
I see the piece, the square, and the color, exactly as the 
workman made them —that is, I see the chess-board 
standing before my adversary; or, at all events, I have an 
exact representation of it, and not that of another board.”’ 
— Taine’s /utelligence, p. 38. 
The same author narrates many other facts that point in 
the same direction — among others the following: “An 
English painter, whose rapidity of execution was marvelous, 
explained his mode of work in this way: ‘When a sitter 
came, I looked at him attentively for half an hour, sketch- 
ing from time to time on the canvas. I wanted no more. 
I put away my canvas and took another sitter. When I 
wished to resume my first portrait, J took the man and sat 
him in the chair, where I saw him as distinctly as if he 
had been before me in his own proper person—-I may 
almost say more vividly. I looked from time to time at 
the imaginary figure, then worked with my pencil, then
-P-A-G-E-178
  EXAMPLES OF SENSATION. — _ 69 
referred to the countenance, and so on, just as I should 
have done had the sitter been there. When I looked at 
the chair I saw the man. Gradually I began to lose the 
distinction between the imaginary figure and the real per- 
son, and sometimes disputed with sitters that they had 
been with me the day before. At last I was sure of it, 
and then — all is confusion. . . . I lost my senses, and 
was thirty years in an asylum.’”’? 
These are a few of many cases that might be cited to 
show that sensations often exist when the nerve that leads 
to the brain is not stimulated. If we should hear a bell 
ring when the rope was not pulled, we should be sure that 
the same effect (swinging of the bell) existed as when the 
rope was pulled. So, likewise, when sensations exist in 
the manner described above, one can scarcely help believ- 
ing that the bell was swinging without the rope being 
pulled — that there was the change in the cortical centre 
that occasions and conditions sensation without the stimu- 
lation of the nerve that usually causes it. 
These four physical antecedents, then — the exciting 
cause, its action upon the nerve, change in the nerve, 
changes in the brain — usually precede the mental fact 
that we call sensation. 
Examples of Sensation. — If now you were asked to 
give examples of sensation, would you mention the hearing 
of a drum and the seeing of arose? I do not believe you 
would. Let us run over the series of facts that result 
from the beating of a drum — vibrating air, action upon 
the auditory. nerve, change all along the auditory nerve, 
change in the brain — and see if we can not distinguish 
1 Taine’s Jutelligen-e p. 46.
-P-A-G-E-179
170 SENSATION. 
between the next term, the sensation, and the hearing of 
the drum. If you beat a drum in the presence of a new- 
born babe, will he hear it? No; he will have a sensation 
of sound, but he will not hear the drum. We may have 
sensations of sound, and not hear anything; sensations of 
color, and not see anything; sensations of smell, and not 
smell anything; sensations of touch, and’ not touch any- 
thing; sensations of taste, and not taste anything. 
What do you mean when you say you see an apple? 
You mean, among other things, that you sée a round 
object, good to eat, and with a pleasant odor when brought 
near the nose. Do you see its odor? No; you learn the 
odor of things through the sense of smell. Do you see its 
taste? Again, no; you learn the taste of things through 
the sense of taste. Do you see its roundness? No; you 
learn the shape of things by the sense of touch and the 
muscular sense. How, then, are you able to know by 
sight alone that an object before you has a certain shape, 
taste, odor, etc. ? 
To answer that question, suppose you ask yourself what 
a man would know of an apple who saw one for the first 
time, and who had never heard of one before. He would 
know its shape, but he would know nothing of its oder 
and taste. If he tastes and smells the apple, the next 
time he sees an object resembling it closely in appear- 
ance, it will be likely to occur to him that it resembles 
it in taste and smell also— in other words, that it is an 
apple. : 
There is, you observe, a great difference between the 
experience of color which you have when you are looking 
at an apple, and the ideas of odor and taste that it sug- 
gests. Zhe experience of color is a present sensation ;
-P-A-G-E-180
DEFINITION OF SENSATION. 17! 
the ideas of odor and taste which it suggests are recollec- 
tions of past sensations of taste and smell. , 
Definition of Sensation. — We are now ready for the 
definition of sensation. {A sensation is that sémp/e mental 
fact that, under normal circumstances, directly follows the 
last change in the brain in consequence af the stimulation 
of a sensory nerve. - 
Note carefully the italicized ‘words. I say, “directly 
follows.” If we bear that in mind, we shall not confuse 
the sensation with what it suggests. The color of an 
apple suggests its taste and odor; but until you actually 
taste and smell it, its taste and smell are not sensations, 
because they do not directly follow the last change in the 
brain resulting from the stimulation of a sensory nerve. 
The only thing that directly follows the last change in the 
brain is the sensation of color; the thought of the taste 
and smell of the apple are the result of the sensation, so 
that this change in the brain makes you think of its smell 
and taste ¢hrough the sensation, or zndirectly. 
If we bear in mind the significance of the word “ simple,” 
it will save us from the same mistake. When you are see- 
ing, hearing, touching, and tasting things, your experience 
is not simple. You have a sensation, and with it the 
recollection of sensations that it suggests. 
                          We can now see 
how we can; have a sensation ‘of sight without seeing any- 
thing. If you are walking along a road, the various objects 
within the range of your vision probably produce sensations 
of sight. Will you see the objects in case they do? That 
depends on whether they suggest the recollection of past 
*
-P-A-G-E-181
172 SENSATION, 
sensations. But, as we know, what we recollect depends 
on what we attend to. When, therefore, you are absorbed 
in thought, the chances are that you will see very few of 
the objects that give you sensations of sight.

LESSON XIX. 
SENSATION, 
(Continued) 
Are Colors, etc., only Mental Facts ? — Let us 
imagine ourselves taking a walk on one of those perfect 
days in June that Lowell speaks of. The fresh, delicate 
green of the trees, the songs of birds, and the odors of a 
thousand flowers and blossoms, delight us. But in the 
midst of our enjoyment the subject of the last lesson occurs 
tous. We cease to enjoy; we begin to think. We ask 
each other if the conclusions reached in the last lesson, 
which seemed so true as we worked them out by gaslight, 
really do hold of the gorgeous panorama that lies spread 
out before us. Is the delicate green of the trees, the deep 
blue of the skies, merely a web of our own mental facts, a 
garment of our own making, with which, unconsciously to 
ourselves, we have covered up the unsightliness of nature? 
Are the so-called songs of birds merely echoes in our own 
souls of soundless motions without ?. In one word, are the 
colors and sounds and odors that seem to fill the scene 
before us oxly mental facts—things which, like the joys 
and sorrows, the hopes and fears, that make up our con- 
scious life, exist in our own minds, and nowhere else? 
Whatever reason may say, our first impulse is to answer 
with an emphatic negative. But as we follow in imagina- 
tion the vibrations of air radiating from the birds in every 
173
-P-A-G-E-183
174 SENSATION. 
direction, and the waves of light from the leaves of the 
trees, we are forced to conclude that leaves, songs of birds, 
blossoms, flowers— are only exciting causes of effects 
which appear in our conscious life as sensations. 
But the thought is unwelcome. We had supposed our- 
selves looking at green trecs, and velvety hills, and a blue 
sky; our reasoning, like the wand of an envious magician, 
seems to strip the world of its beauty, and leave us in the 
presence of —we know not what. We struggle to get 
away from it. We feel as though an old friend, the recol- 
lection of whose voice mingles with the earliest memories 
of our childhood, had suddenly begun to speak to us in an 
unknown tongue; or rather, that the tones and language 
with which we had thought ourselves entirely familiar, and 
which had seemed to signify the most precious things in 
life, had suddenly shivered into meaningless noises— had 
become “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” 
Sounds and Colors as Objective Facts. — In our desire 
to keep the world we have known, we first betake our- 
selves to words. We bethink ourselves of our studies in 
physics, and say that, although sounds and colors are sen- 
sations, yet there are sounds and colors in nature. Un- 
doubtedly, but of what kind? The sounds in nature are 
vibrations of air; the colors, undulations of ether. Are 
these what we think of when we speak of sounds and 
colors? I£ so, the terms with which we describe sounds 
and colors will apply to motions ; when we are speaking of 
sounds and colors, we are speaking of motions. Is it true, 
then, that when we speak of sweet, melodious sounds, we 
mean sweet, melodious motions? Or when we speak of 
rich, gorgeous colors, do we mean rich, gorgeous motions ?

COLORS AND SOUNDS. 175 
A moment’s thought convinces us that the things we have 
in mind when we use these terms are not motions at all; 
the colors and sounds that we think of in ordinary life — 
that thrust themselves upon our notice every moment — are 
not undulations of ether and vibrations of air—are not 
things that the world learned about only after centuries of 
investigation, but the colors and sounds of experience — 
sensations. 
Colors and Sounds not Copies of External Facts. — 
Failing in this attempt, we try again. We say that, 
although the colors and sounds that we talk about are 
sensations, yet they are copies of facts that exist in the 
external world. The colors, sounds, and odors of which 
we have direct knowledge are sensations; but as we know * 
how an object looks without looking at it if we see its 
reflection in a mirror, so the sensations of consciousness 
give us exact knowledge of the world beyond conscious- 
ness; they are the reflections of objects in the external 
world. The green that seems to be spread over the leaves 
is indeed spread over them, but the green that we have 
direct knowledge of is in our own minds. The green in 
our minds is the sensation, the green of experience, the 
copy; the green of the leaves is the outside reality the 
original, This is another of the methods by which we 
seek to avoid accepting the conclusions of our own reason- 
ings. 
But we are at once confronted with a difficulty. I see 
your picture hanging on the wall. I immediately recognize 
it, because picture and original are both before me. But 
you point to another —a picture of a gentleman whom I 
have never seen——and ask me if I think it good. Of
-P-A-G-E-185
176 SENSATION. 
course I can not say, since I have never seen the original. 
Before I can say whether a picture is like the original, I 
must have seen both. As long as I look ata picture of 
which I have never seen the original, J can not say either 
that it is like the original, or that it has any original at 
all, How, then, can we say that our sensations are, like 
the external things which cause them? 
Before we began the investigations of the last lesson, 
we thought that the odors, sounds, and colors of which we 
have direct knowledge were physical facts, external to the 
mind. But we learned in the last lesson that these sup- 
posed physical facts are not physical facts at all. In order 
to stand by our conclusion, and at the same time keep our 
belief in the character of the external world, we have sup- 
"posed that there are parallel series of facts — mental facts 
of which we are conscious, and physical facts of which we 
are-not conscious; the one a copy, the other the original. 
But it is now evident that we have no right to say that 
our sensations are copies of these external facts. We are 
conscious of the one set of facts; we are not conscious of 
the other. Until we become conscious of both——that is, 
until both become sensations——to say that one is a copy 
of the other is to say that something we know is a copy of 
something we do not know. 
But that is not the only difficulty. You have great 
skill in painting. Suppose I should ask you to make me a 
picture of Yankee Doodle. You would tell me that my 
request is absurd, would you not? You would say that 
sounds can resemble sounds, and colors colors, and tastes 
tastes, but that there is such utter unlikeness between 
sounds and colors that we can not use language intelli- 
gently and say that any sound is like any color. Is not
-P-A-G-E-186
. 
SENSATIONS AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. 177 
the same true of mental and physical facts? In what 
sense can we say that a mental fact is a copy of a physi- 
cal fact—a state of consciousness a copy of something 
that is not a state of consciousness? In no sense whatever. 
We must say either that the world of sounds and tastes 
and odors and colors is purely subjective, in the sense of 
consisting of our own mental facts, or else that the con- 
clusions reached in the last lesson are wrong. 
What our Sensations are Depends on our Nervous 
System. — But, apart from these considerations, there are 
many: facts that make any other conclusion impossible. 
That conclusion is that what we call the attributes or 
qualities of objects — tastes, smells, sounds, colors, etc. — 
are sensations which these objects produce in our minds 
through the agency of our nervous system. How does it 
happen that I can make the world look green or red or 
blue or yellow by looking at it through green or red or blue 
or yellow glass? Or that I can change the apparent tem- 
perature of water by changing the temperature of the hand 
I put init? Or that when I am sick nothing tastes as it 
does when I am well? Evidently because the qualities of 
objects are merely ways or modes in which the objects 
affect us through the agency of the nervous system; and 
whenever for any reason a different effect is produced 
upon the nervous system, the object seems to have a dif. 
ferent quality because we have different sensations. In 
the case of the colored glass, the nervous system is affected 
differently because of a change produced by the glass upon 
the agent — light — that acts upon the nervous system. 
In the last case spoken of, the difference in taste is due to 
a difference in the condition of the nervous system itself,
-P-A-G-E-187
. 
178 SENSATION, 
in consequence of the disordered condition of the body. 
Sometimes the quality we attribute to an object-—in other 
words, the sensations produced by it —- depends upon the 
part of the body affected. If you take a pair of compasses, 
whose points are somewhat blunted, and place their points 
on the forearm, in the direction of the length of the arm, 
the two points will seem as one, unless they are more than 
14 inches apart. But placed on the tip of the tongue, the 
two points are distinguished as two when they are as much 
as .0394 of an inch apart. 
These facts make it certain that the quality of an object 
is not something attached to, or inherent in, the object, but 
merely the mode or way in which the object affects us 
through the nervous system. As Professor Ziehen puts it, 
“The constitution of the nervous system is an essential 
factor in determining the quality of sensation. This fact 
reveals the obvious error of former centuries, first refuted. 
by Locke, though still shared by naive thought to-day, that 
the objects about us themselves are colored warm, cold, etc. 
As external to our consciousness, we can only assume 
matter, vibrating with molecular motion and permeated by 
vibrating particles of ether.” 
But Changes in the Nervous System not Always 
Followed by Sensation. — And yet we can not say that 
everything which produces a change in the nervous system 
produces a change in the sensation. If you hold a one- 
pound weight in your hand when your arm is outstretched, 
a friend may add one-half or two-thirds of an ounce — if 
you do not see him — without your knowing it. Not until 
the added weight is about one-seventeenth the original will 
you perceive the difference. And you will find by experi- 
ge
-P-A-G-E-188
WEBER'S LAW. 179 
ment that the same proportion holds if you make the 
weight in your hand heavier — z.c., if it be ten pounds, it 
will be necessary to add nearly ten ounces before you can 
detect the difference. 
Weber’s Law. — This fact illustrates a law that governs 
an immense multitude of facts. Says Professor Wundt : 
“« Every one knows that in the stillness of night we hear 
things which are unperceived in the noise of day. The 
gentle ticking of the clock, the distant bustle of the streets, 
the creaking of the chairs in the room impress themselves 
upon the ear. And every one knows that amid the con- 
fused hubbub of the market-place, or the roar of a railway 
train, we may lose what our neighbor is saying to us, or 
even fail to hear our own voice. The stars which shine so 
brightly at night are invisible by day; and although we 
can see the moon in the day-time, she is far paler than at 
night. Every one who has had to do with weights knows 
that if to a gramme in the hand we add a second gramme, 
the difference is clearly noticed; but if we add it to a kilo- 
gramme, there is no knowledge. of the increase. 
“All these experiences are so common that we think 
them self-evident. Really, that is by no means the case. 
There can not be the least doubt that the clock ticks just 
as loudly by day as by night. In the clamor of the street, 
or amid the noise of the railway, we speak, if anything, 
more loudly than is usual. Moon and stars do not vary in 
the intensity of their light. And no one will deny that 
a gramme weighs the same whether it is added to one 
gramme or to a thousand. 
“The sound of the clock, the light of the stars, the 
pressure of the gramme weight, — all these are sensation
-P-A-G-E-189
180 SENSATION: 
stimuli, and stimuli whose intensity always remains the 
same. What, then, do these experiences teach us? Evi- 
dently nothing else than this: that one and the same 
stimulus will be sensed as stronger or weaker, or not 
sensed at all, according to the circumstances under which 
it operates. But what kinds of change in the circum- 
stances are there which can produce this alteration in 
sensation? On considering the matter closely, we dis- 
cover that the change is everywhere of one kind. The 
tick of the clock is a weak stimulus for our auditory nerves, 
which we hear plainly when it is given by itself, but not 
when it is added to a strong stimulus of rattling wheels 
and all the other turmoil. The light of the stars is a 
stimulus for the eye; but if its stimulation is added to the 
strong stimulus of daylight, we do not notice it, although 
we sense it clearly when it is joined to the weak stimulus 
of twilight. The gramme weight is a stimulus for our 
skin which we sense when it is united to a present stimulus 
of equal strength, but which vanishes when it is combined 
with a stimulus of a thousand times its own intensity.” 
Such facts make it necessary for us to qualify the con- 
_ clusion suggested by the facts before considered, and say 
-» that, whenever the change produced by objects in the 
“nervous system reaches a certain degree —in other words, 
when the new stimulus bears a certain ratio to the pre- 
existing stimulus—that change will be followed by achange 
in the sensations. As the result of an immensely large 
number of experiments the figures which express this ratia 
in the several sense departments have been stated by 
Professor Wundt as follows :

In other words, if we represent the intensity of ligh: 
acting upon the eyes at any time by 100, in order that a 
new light may be perceived, it must be at least as intense 
as y$y of the preceding light stimulus. If we are to hear 
a new sound in the midst of a pre-existing hubbub of 
noises, it must at least be as intense as } of the pre-exist- 
ing noise stimulus, and so on. This law is called Weber’s 
law, because it was discovered by the physiologist Ernst _ 
Heinrich Weber. 
Are Sensations Always Regarded as Qualities of Ob- 
jects ? — But an interesting question here arises: the 
question as to whether our sensations always wore the 
character they now bear — the character of seeming to be 
what they are not — objective qualities of objects, rather 
than subjective effects of these objects, produced through 
the nervous system; or whether in the beginning of our 
conscious life they appeared to be what they are——ex- 
periences of our own minds; or whether, indeed, they did 
not appear to be either, but were simply felt, in a vague 
indefinite way. A very slight observation of a new-born 
child will be sufficient to convince us that his sensations 
do not seem to him as ours do to us. As we have seen 
already, it is probable that in the beginning of our mental 
life we have no definite sensations. Little by little, a 
child’s sensations become definite ; little by little, they are 
built up into the qualities and attributes of the external 
world. How is it done? That is a difficult question, the
-P-A-G-E-191
182 SENSATION. 
answer to which is the solution of the problem of percep- 
tion. But before we can attempt to consider it, we must 
study two laws which play an important part in the matter 
— the law of habit and the law of the association of ideas.

LESSON XX. 
THE LAW OF HABIT. 
WE have already had occasion to notice some of the 
phenomena of habit. The child, at first unable to walk, 
then only a step or two and with great difficulty; the 
cyclist, at first obliged to give his entire attention to his 
wheel; the learner on the piano slowly spelling out the 
notes—are cases in point. Child, cyclist, pianist, all acquire 
the skill which finally seems a sort of second nature through 
habit. 
  
_ Reid on Habit. — Reid says: “As without instinct the © 
infant could not live to become a man, so without habit 
man would remain an infant through life, and would be as 
helpless, as unhandy, as speechless, and as much a child 
in understanding at three-score as at three.” , 
‘Strong as this statement seems, it is probably an under- 
statement of the truth. Without habit, we should rather 
say, a man would be as helpless, as speechless, as unhandy 
at three-score as at birth. Habit is the architect that 
builds the feeble rudimentary powers of the child into the 
strong, developed powers of the full-grown man. If a 
child’s vague, purposeless movements give place to definite 
movements performed for definite purposes, if his- sensa- 
tions become more definite, if his perceptions become

-P-A-G-E-193
184 THE LAW OF HABIT. 
clearer, if his memory becomes more accurate, if he 
reasons more and more correctly and logically, it is be- 
cause of habit. 
Law of Habit.— What is the law of habit? It is that 
every time we perform any action, mental or physical, we 
have more proneness to, and greater facility for, the per- 
formance of that action under similar circumstances than 
we had before. All the curious gestures, ways of holding 
the hands, attitudes, modes of speech, and the like that 
characterize the various people we know, are due to the 
law of habit. 
~ Does Growth Depend on Habit ? — Sully says that the 
“formation of a disposition to think, feel, etc., in the same 
way as before, underlies what we call habit,” and that “in 
its most comprehensive sense” it means “a fixed tendency 
to think, feel, or act in a particular way under special cir- 
cumstances.” He thinks that “habit refers to the fixing 
of mental operations in particular directions,” and hence, 
that it does not constitute the sole ingredient of intellec- 
tual development. He thinks that it is “the element of 
persistence, of custom, the conservative tendency,” and 
that since “growth implies flexibility, modifiability, suscep- 
tibility to new impressions, the progressive tendency,” 
“habit is in a manner opposed to growth.” 
Is he right? Is it true that habit is in a manner 
opposed to growth? I do not think so. 
Habits and the Law of Habit. — His opinion grows 
out of a failure to distinguish between abits and the law 
of Aabiz. Many particular habits undoubtedly are bad.
-P-A-G-E-194
HABITS AND THE LAW OF HABIT. 185 
A man may form the habit of reasoning on insufficient 
data, or of observing carelessly ; he may form the habit of 
forgetting that he is finite, and so liable to mistakes; that 
all that he has, thought on any subject may be wrong 
because he may have overlooked some fact already known, 
or because some unknown fact may contradict all his con- 
clusions. He may form the habit of laying great emphasis 
on consistency, that “ hobgoblin of little minds,” and so go 
through the world with his head turned over his shoulder 
determining what he will believe to-day by what he believed 
yesterday. He may form the habit of deciding what he 
will believe by some other principle than reason. As the 
Chinese go to Confucius, and Catholics to the Pope, to tell 
them what to believe, so he may go to his father, or some 
politician, or the convention of his party, or his newspaper 
to tell him what to believe. These habits are unfavorable 
to growth, and are therefore bad habits ; but is there any- 
thing in the nature of the law of habit to make it necessary 
for us to form bad habits? Are there not some open-minded, 
cautious, independent reasoners? What is an open-minded 
reasoner? He is one who has formed the habit of being 
constantly on the alert to find new evidence; one who 
knows and feels that when men have done their utmost to 
avoid error, they can not be so sure they are right as to | 
shut their minds to all further considerations ; one who has 
so habituated himself to considering the supreme difficulty 
of arriving at the truth in any matter of complexity that 
he is rather inclined to wonder that men are ever right, 
than to assume that they can consider themselves as un- 
doubtedly right whenever they reach a conclusion. What 
is a cautious reasoner? He is one who has so accustomed 
himself to the thought of the infiniteness of the universe,
-P-A-G-E-195
186 THE LAW OF HABIT. 
that what is known in comparison with what zs, seems to 
him like a drop of water in comparison with the Pacific 
Ocean, and hence he habitually realizes the absolute neces- 
sity of collecting as many facts as possible bearing on any 
matter under consideration before he reaches a conclusion. 
What is an independent reasoner? He is one who has no 
Confucius, one who does not go to his father, or to any 
influential politician, or to his party convention, or his 
newspaper to find out what to believe—-oxe who does not 
use his reason to find arguments to defend conclusions 
furnished him from some external source, but uses it to 
learn what is true. 
Hahits Depend on what_we Do. — Such habits, be it 
noted, are as much the result of the law of habit as are 
the habits that are opposed to growth. The law of habit 
tends to make us whatever we want to be enough to ex- 
press our desires in action. Is there any antagonism 
between such habits and growth? Can we say that such 
habits represent the conservative tendency? I can not 
think so. When teachers come to realize that this charac- 
teristic of open-mindedness and caution and independence 
is not only one of the rarest among educated mén, but one 
of the most important; when they realize that no matter 
how able and brilliant a man may seem, he is a fossil, a 
_ thing of arrested development, precisely to the extent to 
which he is lacking in this characteristic ; when they have 
become profoundly convinced of the fact that the supreme 
difference between the most progressive civilizations in the 
world and such nations as the Chinese, is that the people 
of the former have formed the habit, to some extent, of 
going to reason to teli them what to believe, and the
-P-A-G-E-196
HABITS OF REASONING. 187 
people of the latter have formed the habit of accepting 
their beliefs on authority, they will not only be sure that 
there is no antagonism between growth and habit, but 
that an important part of their work consists in rooting 
up the habits which would confine the thoughts of their 
pupils within the thoughts of the past, by helping them 
to form habits of open-minded, cautious, independent 
reasoning. | 
Influence of Example in Forming Habits of Reason- 
ing. — We can not help our pupils form that habit until 
we have formed it for ourselves. It is the example of 
open-minded, cautious, independent reasoning; it is the 
fervid appeal to students not to imitate a flock of sheep, . 
who jump when their leader has jumped, and do not jump 
when he has not jumped, without regard to the considera- 
tions that influenced him —a fervor which can emanate 
only from one who so believes in, as to practice that kind 
of reasoning ; it is the keen and merciless exposure of the 
utter irrationality of unreasonableness by one whose whole 
being is saturated with the conviction — that gives students 
the strongest impulse to the formation of the habit of 
reasoning in this way. 
Example of Socrates. — Moreover, we should ourselves 
love the truth more than we love our own opinions if we 
wish to make our pupils open-minded reasoners. Socrates, 
arguing the question as to the immortality of the soul an — 
hour before he was to suffer death for crimes that he had 
not committed, gives us a beautiful example of this. Two 
of his companions have stated an objection which has 
inflicted a.wound, as he says, on his argument, He admits
-P-A-G-E-197
188 THE LAW OF HABIT. 
that he has the temper of a partisan, rather than that of 
a philosopher, since he wishes to convince himself of the 
immortality of the soul. But even under such circum- 
stances, his loyalty to truth shines out like a star of the 
first magnitude. “This is the state of mind,” he said, 
«, . . in which I approach the argument. And I would 
ask you to be thinking of the truth and not of Socrates: 
agree with me if I seem to you to be speaking the truth ; 
or if not, withstand me might and main, that I may not 
deceive you as well as'myself in my enthusiasm and, like 
. the bee, leave my sting in you before I die.” 
Basis of Habit. — Is the basis of habit physical or 
mental? In other words, is the law of habit due to the 
fact that our bodies, and especially our nervous systems, 
-are constituted as they are, or is it due to the character 
of our minds? Is the law of habit due to the fact that 
whatever we do-leaves an effect upon some part of the 
body which makes it easier to do the same thing under 
similar circumstances, or.is it an ultimate law of the mind 
as such, about which no more can be said than that it is 
a fact? - 
Stupidity of some Actions Performed through Habit. 
— Numerous facts indicate that the former is the case. 
The utter stupidity of many actions performed through 
habit make it hard to believe that the mind has anything 
to do with them. I have heard of a student who picked 
up a coal-scuttle on a cold winter-day, took it to a pump, 
and filled it with water, and then emptied it into his stove. 
If the basis of habit is physical, we can understand such 
cases. In that case we are to regard the body as tending
-P-A-G-E-198
ETHICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL INFERENCES, 189 
to become under the influence of the mind, a vast complex 
of machines fitted to perform certain actions when the 
conditioris are fulfilled, whether the performance of the 
action leads to an intelligent result or not. In the language 
of Professor Ladd, we should in that case regard habitual 
actions as “done for the psychic life by a physical autom- 
aton rather than zz or dy the psychic life.” We should 
say that “when this automaton once becomes trained 
under conscious physical influences, it performs many 
highly complicated and purposeful motor changes, without 
troubling the flow of consciousness to pay attention to 
them.” But as those purposeful actions are performed 
because certain physical conditions are fulfilled, so when 
these physical conditions are fulfilled, these actions will be 
performed whether they are purposeful or not, — as a gun 
will fire with equal readiness whether it is intelligently 
directed at a dangerous enemy, or whether it is aimed by 
a lunatic at a man whose life is essential to the welfare of 
the State. Assuming, then, that the law of habit has a 
physical basis, we have an easy explanation of the stupidity 
of many mechanical actions. The physical machine goes 
off, so to speak, whenever the trigger is pulled, whether 
the result is purposeful or not. But upon the supposition 
that the law of habit has its basis in the mind, we are con- 
fronted with the remarkable fact that actions imputed to 
intelligence are often wholly destitute of all the qualities 
that are characteristic of intelligence. 
Ethical and Pedagogical Inferences.— Professér James - 
has stated the ethical and pedagogical inferences from the | 
law of habit so much better than any one else, that I shall 
quote him at length.
-P-A-G-E-199
190 THE, LAW OF HABIT. 
Importance .of a Strong Initiative. — “In Professor 
Bain’s chapter on ‘The Moral Habits’ there are some 
admirable practical remarks laid down. Two great maxims 
emerge from his treatment. The first is that in the acqui- 
sition of a new habit, or the leaving off of an old one, we 
must take care to Jaunch ourselves with as strong. and 
decided an initiative as possible. Accumulate all the 
possible circumstances which shall re-enforce the right 
motives; put yourself assiduously in conditions that en- 
courage the new way; make engagements incompatible 
with the old; take a public pledge, if the case allows; in 
short, envelop your resolution with every aid you know. 
This will give your new beginning such a momentum that 
the temptation to break down will not occur as soon as it 
otherwise might; and every day during which a break- 
down is postponed adds to the chances of its not occurring 
at all. 
Never Suffer an Exception to Occur. — “The second 
maxim is: Never suffer an exception to occur till the 
new habit is securely rooted in your life. Each lapse is 
like the letting fall of a ball of string which one is care- 
fully winding up; a single slip undoes more than a great 
» many turns will wind again. Continuity of training is the 
great means of making the nervous system act infallibly 
right. As Professor Bain says: 
*«¢The peculiarity of the moral habits, contradistinguish- 
ing them from the intellectual acquisitions, is the presence 
of two hostile powers, one, to be gradually raised into the 
ascendant over the other. It is necessary, above all 
things, in such a situation, never to lose a battle. Every 
gain on the wrong side undoes the effect of many con-
-P-A-G-E-200
  ACT ON FIRST OPPORTUNITY. igi 
quests on the right. The essential precaution, therefore, 
is so to regulate the two opposing powers that the one may 
have a series of uninterrupted successes, until repetition 
has fortified it to such a degree as to enable it to cope 
with the opposition, under any circumstances. This is the 
theoretically best career of mental progress.’ 
Act on First Opportunity. — “A third maxim may be 
added to the preceding pair: Seize the very first possible 
opportunity to act on every resolution you make, and on 
every emotional prompting you may experience in the 
direction of the habits you aspire to gain. It is not in 
the moment of their forming, but in the moment of their 
producing motor effects, that resolves and aspirations com- 
municate the new ‘set’ to the brain. As the author last 
quoted remarks : 
««The actual presence of the practical opportunity alone 
furnishes the fulcrum upon which the lever can rest, by 
means of which the moral will may multiply its strength, 
and raise itself aloft. He who has no solid ground to press 
against will never get beyond the stage of empty gesture- 
making.’ 
Actions versus Sentiments and Maxims.“ No matter 
how full a reservoir of maxims one may possess, and no 
matter how good one’s sentiments may he, if one have not 
taken advantage of every concrete opportunity to acé, one’s 
character may remain entirely unaffected for the better. 
With mere good intentions, hell is proverbially paved. And 
this is an obvious consequence of the principles we have 
laid down. ‘A character,’ as J. S. Mill says, ‘is a com- 
pletely fashioned will’; and a will, in the sense in which 
f
-P-A-G-E-201
192 THE LAW OF HABIT. 
he means it, is an aggregate of tendencies to act in a firm 
and prompt and definite way upon all the principal emer- 
gencies of life. A tendency to act only becomes effectively 
ingrained in us in proportion to the uninterrupted fre- 
quency with which the actions actually occur, and the 
brain ‘grows’ to their use. Every time a resolve or a 
fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing practical 
fruit is worse than a chance lost ; it works so as positively 
to hinder future resolutions and emotions from taking the 
normal path of discharge. There is no more contemptible 
type of human character than that of the nerveless senti- 
mentalist and dreamer, who spends his life in a weltering 
sea of sensibility and emotion, but who never does a 
manly concrete deed. Rousseau, inflaming all the mothers 
of France, by his eloquence, to follow Nature and nurse 
their babies themselves, while he sends his own children 
to the foundling hospital, is the classical example of what 
I mean. But every one of us in his measure, whenever, 
after glowing for an abstractly formulated Good, he practi- 
cally ignores some actual case, among the squalid ‘other 
particulars’ of which that same Good lurks disguised, treads 
straight on Rousseau’s path. All Goods are disguised by 
the vulgarity of their concomitants, in this work-a-day world ; 
but woe to him who can only recognize them when he thinks 
them in their pure and abstract form! The habit of exces- 
sive novel-reading and theatre-going will produce true mon- 
sters in this line. The weeping of a Russian lady over the 
fictitious personages in the play, while her coachman is 
freezing to death on his seat outside, is the sort of thing that 
everywhere happens on a less glaring scale. Even the 
habit of excessive indulgence in music, for those who are 
neither performers themselves nor musically gifted enough
-P-A-G-E-202
CULTIVATE FACULTY OF EFFORT. 193 
to take it in a purely intellectual way, has probably a 
relaxing effect upon the character. One becomes filled 
with emotions which habitually pass without prompting to 
any deed, and so the inertly sentimental condition is kept 
up. The remedy would be, never to suffer one’s self to 
have an emotion at a concert, without expressing it after- 
ward in some active way. Let the expression be the least 
thing in the world — speaking genially to one’s aunt, or 
giving up one’s seat in a horse-car, if nothing more heroic 
offers — but let it not fail to take place. 
“These latter cases make us aware that it is not simply 
particular lines of discharge, but also general forms of 
discharge, that seem to be grooved out by habit in the 
brain. Just as, if we let our emotions evaporate, they get 
into a way of evaporating ; so there is reason to suppose 
that if we often flinch from making an effort, before we 
know it.the effort-making capacity will be gone; and that, 
if we suffer the wandering of our attention, presently it 
will wander all the time. Attention and effort are, as we 
shall see later, but two names for the same psychic fact. 
To what brain-processes they correspond we do not know. 
The strongest reason for believing that they do depend on 
brain-processes at all, and are not pure acts of the spirit, 
is just this fact, that they seem in some degree subject to 
the law of habit, which is a material law. 
Cultivate Faculty of Effort. — “As a final practical 
maxim, relative to these habits of the will, we may, then, 
offer something like this: Keep the faculty of effort alive 
in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day. "That is, 
be systematically ascetic or heroic in little ‘unnecessary 
points, do every day or two something for no other reason
-P-A-G-E-203
194 THE LAW OF HABIT. 
than that you would rather not do it, so that when the 
hour of dire need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved 
and untrained to stand the test. Asceticism of this sort is 
like the insurance which a man pays on his house and goods. 
The tax does him no good at the time, and possibly may 
never bring hima return. But if the fire does come, his 
having paid it will be his salvation from ruin. So with the 
man who has daily inured himself to habits of concentrated 
attention, energetic volition, and self-denial in unnecessary 
things. He will stand like a tower when everything rocks 
around him, and when his softer fellow-mortals are win- 
nowed like chaff in the blast. 
Physiological Study of Mental Conditions an Ally of 
Ethics. — “The physiological study of mental conditions is 
thus the most powerful ally of hortatory ethics. The hell 
to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells, is no 
worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world 
by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. 
Could the young but realize how soon they will become 
mere walking bundles of habit, they would give more heed 
to their conduct while in the plastic state. We are spin- 
ning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. 
Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never 
so little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson’s 
play, excuses himself for every fresh dereliction by say- 
ing : ‘I won’t count this time!’ Well! he may not count 
it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; but it is being 
counted none the less. Down among his nerve cells and 
fibres the molecules are counting it, registering and storing 
it up to be used against him when the next temptation 
comes, Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific literal-

ness, wiped out. Of course, this has its geod side as well 
as its bad one. As we become permanent drunkards by 
so many separate drinks, so we become saints in the 
moral, and authorities and experts in the practical and 
scientific spheres, by so many separate acts and hours of 
work. Letno youth have any anxiety about the upshot of 
his education, whatever the line of it may be. If he keep 
faithfully busy each hour of the working-day, he may 
safely leave the final result to itself. He can with perfect 
| certainty count on waking up some fine morning, to find 
himself one of the competent ones of his generation, in 
whatever pursuit he may have singled out. Silently, be- 
tween all the details of his business, the power of judging 
in all that class of matter will have built itself up within 
him as a possession that will never pass away. Young 
people should know this truth in advance. The ignorance 
of it has probably engendered more discouragement and 
faint-heartedness in youths embarking on arduous careers- 
than all other causes put together.”

LESSON XXI. 
ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. | 
Association of Ideas Illustrated.-—If you think about 
anything, no matter what, you are sure to find yourself 
thinking, the moment after, of something connected with 
it. Think about the last school you attended, and you may 
think of a schoolmate, or of some of the books you studied, 
or of some of the games you played. Think of Napoleon, 
and you may think of a friend who lent you a book about 
him, or of some of his battles, or of Alexander or Czesar.° 
This fact, that thinking of anything tends to make us think 
of something else connected with it, is called the associa- 
tion of ideas. 
Different Kinds. — If you watch: the course of your 
thoughts for an hour, you will find that there are very 
different kinds of connection between the ideas recalled 
and the experiences that recall them. If you think of a 
hill, it may make you think of a walk you took there last 
-night, or of one like it near your own home. The thought 
of: the hill makes you think of the walk you took there, 
because when you were taking the walk you thought of 
the hill. In other words, the thought of the hill and the 
thought of the walk were in your mind at the same time. 
The thought of the hill makes you think of one like it near 
196
-P-A-G-E-206
MECHANICAL ASSOCIATION. 197 
your home, not because you have ever seen or thought of 
them both at the same time before, but because they are 
like each other. 
Association of the first kind — association by contiguity, 
as it is generally termed — is sometimes called mechanical 
association ; and I think it will be useful for us to remem- 
ber both names, and the reasons for them. It is called 
association by contiguity because contiguity means near- 
ness, and the things associated by contiguity were thought 
of at or about the same time. It is called mechanical 
association to contrast it with another kind of association 
called logical or rational. When the thought of the hill 
makes you think of one like it near your own home, it is 
because there is an zzzer relation — similarity — and not 
a mere external, mechanical relation between them. But 
if the first time a child sees a Chinaman and a steam- 
engine he sees them both together, the next time he sees 
one of them he will be likely to think of the other, not 
because they have an inner connection, but because they 
were seen at the same time. Hence this kind of associa- 
tion is called mechanical, because the things associated 
have only an external or mechanical connection; it is 
called association by contiguity because they were thought 
of at or about the same time. 
Mechanical Association. — Evidently the connecting 
link in the case of things mechanically associated is time ; 
but we must be careful to remember that the time which 
forms this connecting link is xot the time in which events 
happen, but the time in which we think of them. The 
Declaration of Independence makes you think of the 
Fourth of July, not because it was made on that day, but 
\
-P-A-G-E-207
198 ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 
because the thought of the two has been in your mind at 
the same time. 
Logical Association. — But in order that we may asso- 
ciate things rationally or logically, we must be able to per- 
ceive some zzner relation between them. Things as un- 
related as it is possible for things to be in this world may 
be brought side by side in space; and if so, we may see 
them at the same time, and so associate them mechanically. 
But in order to associate them logically we must be able 
to apprehend an inner relation between them — a relation 
not depending on accident or chance, but growing out of 
their very nature. 
Of these inner relations, besides likeness, the relations 
of cause and effect, of instrument and use, of means and 
end, of premise and conclusion, of law and example, at 
once occur to us; and a careful study of them will enable 
us to realize the contrast between the zwnerness of logical 
relations and the owterness of mechanical relations. Two 
peaches can not but be like each other — they would not 
be peaches if they were not; a good school must be a use- 
ful agency in developing the minds of its pupils; fire must 
throw out heat as long as the present constitution of the 
‘world remains the same. In all these cases it is evident 
that the relation is not external or accidental or casual, 
but iver — growing out of the very nature of the things 
themselves. . 
Importance of the Distinction between Mechanical 
and Logical Association. — The distinction between 
mechanical and rational association is of the first impor- 
tance in Psychology. Many psychologists hold a theory of

the mind which would do away with all ‘ation ‘Auditing ) Mf 
—which would make what seems to be Yational association 
nothing but mechanical association. I cannot but think 
. that they are wrong. But we need to sot te” liat many, Sy 
actions that seem to be due to rational assotiations maa 
be, and probably are, due to mechanical associations. 
When a dog goes out into the field, about sunset, and drives 
a herd of cows home, it seems to be a case of rational asso- 
ciation. It seems as though he had perceived the rela- 
tion between milking time and driving the cows into the 
pound in order to be milked. We are inclined to suppose 
that his thoughts took some such form as the following: 
“It is about milking time, so I wili bring the cows -home 
in order that they may be milked.” But more careful 
consideration will make it clear that we need not suppose 
any such thing. We may suppose that the various circum- 
stances characteristic of approaching sunset caused the 
idea of going after the cows to arise in his mind dy purely 
mechanical associations. In other words, the perception 
of approaching sunset was followed in his mind by the 
thought of going after the cows without any perception of 
the relation between them, and the thought of going after 
the cows by the sensations of motion resulting from carry- 
ing his idea into effect, without any perception of the 
relation between bringing them home and milking time. 
What seems to be a case of reasoning may be, and prob- 
ably is, nothing but a series of mechanical associations. 
Why Ideas Rationally Associated Recall Each Other. 
— But why does a cause make us think of its effect; a 
means, of the end it is adapted to reach; an instrument, 
of its use; a premise, of a conclusion? Partly because

1 inthe thought of the two has been in the mind at the same 
time. But that this is not a complete answer is evident 
from the fact that, of the various thoughts in our minds at 
‘» the same time, those are most likely to recall each other 
that have some inner relation. Of the things we think of 
during the course of a day, most of them pass away beyond 
the possibility of recall, because they are meaningless, 
isolated, disconnected — because the only connection be- 
tween them is the time in which we think of them. 
Evidently, therefore, there is something in the fact that 
thoughts have some logical connection, which tends to 
make them recall each other. Let us see if we can learn 
what it is. 
    Because Apprehension of Relations is a Source of 
Pleasure. — We know that anything upon which we fix 
our minds for a considerable length of time—anything 
that interests us, anything that for any reason we attend 
to—is more likely to be recalled than the things which 
merely flit across our minds like shadows across a land- 
scape. But the things that have an inner relation are 
precisely those we are sure to attend to, provided we 
apprehend the relation. We are sure to attend to them 
in the first place, because the apprehension of relations is 
a source of keen intellectual pleasure. We have seen 
already how it delights the mind to have a lot of discon- 
nected, straggling facts marshaled into compact array, 
each one dropping into its proper place in relation to the 
rest. It increases our sense of power. To carry a load of 
facts by mechanical association has been aptly compared 
to the carrying of food “in 4 bundle strapped upon the 
back”; the carrying of the same facts by rational associa.
-P-A-G-E-210
APPREHENSION OF RELATIONS. 201 
tion, to the carrying of the same food “eaten, digested, 
and wrought over into the bones and muscles which hold 
the body firm and solid.” Now, whatever adds to our 
sense of power— whatever gives us pleasure —is sure to 
be attended to; and the greater the feeling of power, and 
the keener the pleasure it gives us, the greater the amount 
of attention we give it. 
Also of Practical Importance. — But apart from this 
the apprehension of inner relations is of the greatest prac- 
tical interest to us, The ability to go from effects to 
causes and from causes to effects, from laws to examples 
and from facts to laws, from premises to conclusions and 
from particulars to premises, to adapt means to their ends 
and instruments to their uses, not only marks the great 
difference between the mind of a civilized man and that of a 
savage, but results in the almost infinitely greater command 
that the former has over the resources of nature. To have 
special ability in the apprehension of the inner relations of 
things is to have power not only as an intellectual posses- 
sion, but in the sense of ability to accomplish the things 
that men wish to accomplish in life. This is another rea- 
son why we are sure to attend to things when we perceive 
their inner relations ; whether they have a natural interest 
for‘us or not, they have an acquired interest, because we 
know we can use such knowledge in reaching desired 
results. 
Influence of Habit. — These two causes bring a third 
one into operation. Because of these two causes a larga 
part of our intellectual life consists in the search for inner 
relations, Study, as we first conceived it, consisted in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
202 ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 
exercise of mechanical association. But both as students 
and as men and women of the world we have come to have 
an entirely different notion of it. We have come to see 
that study — thought — consists in the attempt to appre- 
hend the inner relations of things and to see that progress 
—no matter in what direction — depends upon the success 
of our efforts. In this way we form the habit of noticing 
the inner relations of things, even when we do not see how 
the knowledge is.likely to be of practical value. For these 
three reasons, then, (1) because of the pleasure the mind 
derives from the perception of inner relations ; (2) because 
of the practical interest such relations have for us; and 
(3) because of habit— we are more likely to attend to 
things between which the mind perceives them than to 
disconnected facts. The reason, therefore, why we are 
more likely to recall things associated logically than we 
are to recall any other facts experienced at the same time 
is because the former are more closely attended to. 
We are left, then, with two great laws of association: 
The law of association by contiguity that thoughts or ideas 
or experiences that have been in the mind at or about the 
same time tend to recall each other; and the law of associa- 
tion by similarity that simlar thoughts or ideas or expe- 
riences tend to recall each other. / 
Spontaneous Reproduction. — Many psychologists con- 
tend that the explanation of the appearance of every idea 
in the mind is found in the law of association; that, no 
matter what we find ourselves thinking of, the reason why 
we are thinking of it is that it was “suggested” by some 
other idea or experience. Others— among them Professor 
Ladd — contend that there is such a thing as spontaneous
-P-A-G-E-212
SIMILARITY AND CONTIGUITY. 203 
reproduction, such a thing as the appearance of ideas not 
suggested by other ideas but due to the fact that “every 
vivid, life-like, and frequently repeated impression tends to 
reproduce itself again and again.” 
It seems to me that the advocates of spontaneous repro- 
duction are right. Who has not found himself haunted 
hour after hour and sometimes day after day by some 
pleasing melody. “TI can not get it out of my mind,” we 
say at such times. And the man is fortunate who has not 
found himself haunted by an entirely different experience, 
a sense of calamity and trouble from which he can not 
escape, which follows him like his shadow. The fact cer- 
tainly seems to be, not that everything suggests these 
experiences, but rather “that we can not find percepts or 
ideas impressive enough to suggest any other than the 
dominant idea.” At such times men sometimes try — and 
how often in vain !— to put their minds on a book in order 
to get away from the unwelcome thoughts, as a sufferer 
from toothache secks by similar methods to forget his 
agonizing pain. And as a man suffesing from toothache 
often finds it impossible to forget it, because its cause 
is found in existing nervous conditions, so we often find 
it impossible to get away from the troubles that oppress 
us, because their spontaneous tendency to occupy the 
mind is more than a match for the ideas that we are able 
to bring before us by the association of ideas. 
Can Association by Similarity be Explained by 
Association by Contiguity ?—— Some psychologists at- 
tempt to explain association by similarity by asscciation 
by contiguity. The following quotation from Thomas 
Brown will explain their position : “A ruff like that worn
-P-A-G-E-213
204 ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 
by Queen Elizabeth brings before us the sovereign her- 
self, though the person who wears the ruff may have no 
other circumstance of resemblance; ... it-is necessary 
only that a part of the complexity (the Queen) should be 
recalled —as the ruff—to bring back all the other parts, 
by the mere principle of contiguity. ... In like manner 
we might be able to reduce every case of suggestion” — 
association --- “from direct resemblance to the influence 
of mere contiguity.” 
We might state his illustration this way: ruff + abcd 
(abcd meaning a person wearing it) recalls ruff + efgh 
(efg meaning Elizabeth), because the thought of Eliza- 
beth and the ruff were in our minds at the same time. 
Can Association by Contiguity be Explained by 
Association by Similarity ? — Others explain association 
by contiguity by association by similarity. The same 
example can be used to illustrate their position. They 
would say, granted that ruff + abcd recalls ruff + efgh 
because there is a #uff in both cases, yet the ruff that 
Elizabeth wore is not the one we see now. Let & stand 
for the ruff we see now and A’ for the ruff worn by Eliza- 
beth, and we can symbolize the facts in this form: Rabcd 
recalls R’efgh. Stated in this form, they say, it is evi- 
dent that Raédcd recalls R efg hk because of the likeness 
between R and R’. 
I think we shall agree that the latter have only explained 
why R recalls R’. To account for the fact that we think of 
efgh also, I think we must say R’ recalls efg# because R’ 
and efgh were thought of at the same time. In other words, 
association by contiguity is an ultimate mental law, ulti- 
mate because it can not be analyzed into anything simpler.
-P-A-G-E-214
FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF ASSOCIATION. 205 
Fundamental Law of Association. —.We have, then, 
as our fundamental law of association ‘the following : Oxe 
thought, idea, or experience tends to recall similar 
thoughts, ideas, or experiences, and all other thoughts, 
ideas, or experiences that were in the mind at the same 
time. Remembering the influence exerted upon associa- 
tion by the apprehension of inner relations, we see that 
the above law requires qualification: One thought, idea, or 
experience tends to recall similar thoughts, ideas, or expe- 
riences, and all other thoughts, ideas, or experiences that 
were in the mind at the same time, the latter with a force 
proportionate to the number and clearness of the inner 
relations apprehended between them and the attention we 
bestow upon them. 
Explanation of the Association of Ideas. — But, after 
all, what does this so-called law amount to? If we ex- 
amine it closely, we shall see that all it does is to describe 
the facts. When we are thinking of one thing, we are 
likely the next moment to find ourselves thinking of some 
similar thing, or of something which we have thought of 
before when we were thinking of that thing. That is 
what the law states, but as to why it is so, it is as silent 
as the sphynx. Can we assign a cause for the association 
of ideas? Can we tell why it is that the thought of one 
thing tends to recall the thought of some other thing? 
Physical Basis. — There seems good reason for sup- 
posing that the association of ideas is due to the law of 
habit in the nervous system. The’ similarity between the 
phenomena of habit and association by contiguity is evi- 
dent at a glance. Now, if we suppose~—-as we must —
-P-A-G-E-215
206 ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 
that there is a physical basis for these thoughts or ideas 
associated by contiguity, we shall see that there is reason 
for supposing that one thought recalling another thought 
that has been in the mind before in connection with it, is 
due to the fact that one brain change tends to excite another 
brain change which has been active before in connection 
with it. We have seen that the various parts of the cortex 
are connected with each other by fibres called association 
fibres. It is these fibres which are supposed to be the 
conductors along which the nervous current passes from 
one part of the cortex to another which has been in a state 
of-excitement at the same time. 
Further, if we suppose that similar ideas have their physi- 
cal basis in the same part of the brain——as the evidence 
requires us to do at least to a certain extent, since it has 
already been proved, as we have seen, that sensations of 
sight are localized in a particular part of the cortex— 
we shall be able to form a crude sort of notion of how it 
happens that thinking of one thing tends to make us think 
of a similar thing. The thought of the one thing is due 
to the excitement of some of the same cortical cells whose 
excitation caused the thought of the preceding thing, and 
therefore the excitation of the cells corresponding to the 
thought of one thing causes, by the law of habit, the 
excitation of the cells corresponding to the thought of 
the other thing. 
Limitations of such Explanations. -— But if we accept 
this crude explanation as entirely complete and satisfactory 
— and it is far from it — there are some facts which neither 
it nor any other physical explanation has ever made clear. 
Granted, for example, that the excitation of similar parts
-P-A-G-E-216
QUESTIONS, 207 
of the brain causes similar thoughts to arise in the mind, 
how do we know that those thoughts are similar? The 
existence of similar thoughts is one thing; the coxsctous- 
ness of their similarity is a radically different thing. 
But the thorough discussion of these questions is too 
difficult for such elementary study as ours. If you wish 
to see the best explanation that has ever been given of 
the association of ideas, read Professor James's Psychology, 
and if you wish to see a forcible statement of the limita- 
tions of all such explanations, read Professor Ladd’s Physio- 
logical Psychology,

LESSON XXII 
PERCEPTION. . 
Knowledge Begins with Sensations. — We have seen 
already that all knowledge takes its rise in sensation. The 
mental history of every human being begins with its first 
sensation. Before the first sensation, the only difference 
between a human being and any other growing thing —a 
tree, for instance — so far as mind is concerned, consists 
in the fact that the former possesses the potentiality of 
mind. ‘This potentiality first begins to become actuality 
when the human being experiences its first sensations. 
Sensations Exist before they are Known. — But 
although knowledge takes its rise in sensation, it by no 
means follows that the first experience of sensations con- 
stitutes the beginning of knowledge. If we consider what 
knowledge is, we shall see that, in the nature of the case, 
the mind must have sensations before it knows it has 
them. I do not mean merely that a fact must exist in 
order to be known. That, of course, is true of sensations, 
but more than that is true. Sensations not only must 
exist in order to be known, but they may exist — and often 
do — for a considerable period before they are known; 
and I think, if we realize what knowledge is, we shall see 
that in the nature of the case this must be 80. 
208
-P-A-G-E-218
WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE?’ 209 
What is Knowledge ? — What is it to know a thing? 
It is to put it into a class, is it not? A child sees a 
menagerie, and fixes his eyes on an animal unknown to 
him. In what does his ignorance of it consist? In his 
inability to class it. He looks at it steadily, and suddenly 
shouts, “Oh, it is an elephant!” What has happened? 
How is it that ignorance has given place to knowledge? 
He has ‘suddenly noticed the resemblance between. this 
unknown object and certain pictures he has seen in his 
teading-book ; he has put it into a class, and when he has 
classed it he knows it. 
This putting things into classes constitutes the essence 
of ai/ knowing. Some kinds of knowledge we call science 
— orderly, systematic knowledge — knowledge of laws and 
causes and principles; other kinds we call unscientific, 
because in these cases our knowledge is unsystematic and 
disconnected. But whether we know scientifically or un- 
scientifically, i in order to know a thing we must classify it, 
and in the act of classification consists our knowledge of 
it. Before Newton, no one understood the motions of the 
moon. He helped us to understand them — explained 
them, as we say — by helping us to classify them. Butin | 
what does our understanding of them consist? Merely in 
that we have put them into a class along with many 
familiar facts. As the child felt that he knew the animal 
in the menagerie when he noticed its resemblance to the 
pictures he had seen in his reading-book, so we feel that 
we understand the motions of the heavenly bodies when 
we have put them into the same class with familiar facts, 
such as the falling of a leaf or the dropping of a stone. 
As to the cause of these motions —-as to the nature of the 
force upon which they depend — we are as ignorant to-day
-P-A-G-E-219
f 
  210 PERCEPTION. 
as were those old Chaldzeans who used to stand on the 
plains of Chaldzea gazing up into the sky with that wonder- 
ing curiosity which has been so well called the mother of 
knowledge. We call it gravity, and think we know all 
about it, because when the mind sees the resemblance 
between a strange fact and familiar facts the sense of 
mystery is gone. Suppose we should ask what is the 
cause of death, would you think it a sufficient answer to 
say that all things die? That is a precise illustration of 
our explanation of the motions of the heavenly bodies. 
What makes the heavenly bodies move? The law of 
gravitation, or the force of gravity, is answered. But that 
is only another way of saying that all bodies move. 
If, then, all knowing is merely classifying —if a thing 
unknown is merely a thing unclassified —the first sensa- 
tions must be unknown. A boy can not put his first piece 
of money in his purse with the rest of his money, because 
he has no other money. So the first sensation can not be 
classed with preceding sensations, because, since it is the 
first, it has no predecessors. Knowledge, then, takes its 
rise in sensations, not in the sense that the first experience 
of sensations constitutes the beginning of knowledge, but 
in the sense that sensations constitute the first material 
upon which the mind’s powers of knowing are exerted. 
Characteristics of the First Sensations. — Observa 
tions of new-born children will not only confirm this 
reasoning, but will lead us to suppose that for some little 
period in the beginning of a child’s life there is no knowl- 
edge of sensations. Knowledge begins with attention. 
Not till the child attends to his sensations can he be said 
to know them in any proper sense of the word. But what
-P-A-G-E-220
CHARACTERISTICS OF FIRST SENSATIONS, 211 
shall we say of these sensations before they are known? 
What characteristics do they have? Mone whatever. Our 
sensations are ¢#is rather than ¢kat—- sensations of color 
rather than sensations of sound — through being known. 
Before they are known — before they are individualized 
through being attended to and classed — we can ‘call them 
sensations of sound, for example, only in the sense that 
they are occasioned by the stimulation of the auditory 
nerve. We speak of zkzs sensation and ¢hat idea because 
we have fixed our attention upon the fact so individualized, 
and have chosen to consider it as a whole. But all the 
experiences. we have at any moment are parts of one 
indivisible whole, and such distinctness as they have is the 
result of a gradual process of differencing brought about 
by attention and classification. Ward well says: “It is 
impossible for us now to imagine the effects of years of 
experience removed, or to picture the character of our 
infantile presentations” — sensations — “ before our inter- 
ests had led us habitually to concentrate attention on some 
and to ignore others, whose intensity thus diminished as 
that of the former increased. In place of the many things 
which we can now see and hear, not merely would there 
then be a confused presentation of the whole field of 
vision, and of a mass of indistinguished sounds, but even 
the difference between sights and sounds themselves would 
be without its present distinctness. Thus the farther we 
go back, the nearer we approach to a total presentation” 
— experience —“. .. in which differences are latent.” 
This, then, is the material first presented to the mind 
—an undifferenced, unindividualized, confused, indefinite 
mass of sensational experience due to the excitation of the 
varios sensory nerves — an experience not of this and that
-P-A-G-E-221
aie 212 PERCEPTION, 
and the other, because attention has. not discriminated the 
elements of experience into “thises” and “thats” and 
“others”; this is the material first presented to the mind 
through the senses. But what do the senses seem to tell 
us now? 
What the Senses Tell us of Objects. — Put an apple 
on your table and sit far enough away from it to prevent 
it from affecting any sense but the sense of sight. What 
do you learn about it through the sense of sight? Merely 
its color. But what is color? A quality of objects, we 
should have said a little while ago. But have we not seen 
that this quality of objects, this color of the apple, is 
simply a sensation, a state of our minds? A sensation, 
we have seen, is that simple mental state that directly 
follows the last change in the brain that results from the 
stimulation of a sensory nerve. Is any nerve stimulated in 
this case? Yes; the optic nerve. The waves of light 
strike the retina of the eye and cause a change in it, and 
this in the adjacent particles of the optic nerve, and these 
in the particles next to them, and so on until the brain is 
- reached ; and then — what happens then? Why then, as 
we have seen, there follows a sensation of color. 
Close your eyes now, and request a friend to bring the 
apple near enough to you to enable you to smell it. What 
does the sense of smell tell you about it? Simply its odor. 
But what is odor? Is it not evident that it is simply a 
sensation?, It is unnecessary to repeat the reasonings of 
the last paragraph. We have again a stimulation of a 
sensory nerve, a change all along the nerve, a change in 
the brain, and then —a sensation. 
Evidently all that the senses tell us of objects is the
-P-A-G-E-222
QUESTIONS. 213 
sensations they produce in our minds. But this s» not — 
what they seem to tell us. They seem to tell us of objects, 
and of these (1) as having definite qualities, and (2) occu- 
pying a definite position in space. The apple that the 
sense of sight reveals to me is an object having certain 
definite qualities — round, red, mellow, etc.— and in a 
certain place — on the window-sill some ten feet away. 
Problem of Perception,—In some way, then, those 
undifferenced, unindividualized, indefinite sensations with 
which our mental life began not only become definite, but. 
are, as it were, projected out of us, and regarded as quali- 
ties of external objects. How do they get these three 
characteristics? (1) How does a sensation that was not 
first known even as a sensation of color, for example, 
become known as a definite sensation of color — say a par- 
ticular shade of red? (2) How does it become localized 
—projected at a certain distance—-say ten feet away? 
(3) How does it become regarded as a quality of an 
external object, such as an apple? To answer these three 
questions is to explain the problem of perception.

LESSON XXIII. 
PERCEPTION. 
( Continued.) 
WE saw in the last lesson that what the senses really 
tell us of objects is Low they affect us— the sensations 
produced by them in our minds — but that they seem to 
tell us of objects themselves as having certain qualities, 
and occupying a certain place. 
What the Mind Does when it Perceives. — What does 
the mind do to its sensations of color and smell and taste 
in order to perceive colors, odors, and tastes as qualities of 
objects? It groups them tégether, does it not? When 
you look at an apple, you group its color, taste, and smell 
together as qualities of one object. Sully puts it as fol- 
lows: “Sense-impressions” — he means sensations — “are 
the alphabet by which we spell out the objects presented 
tous. In order to grasp or apprehend these objects, these 
letters must be put together after the manner of words. 
Thus the apprehension of an apple by the eye involves 
the putting together of various sensations of sight, touch, 
and taste. This is the mind’s own work, and is known as 
perception.” He compares sensations to the letters of 
the alphabet; and precisely as in reading we put the 
letters b, r, i, c, k together and read “brick,” so, in per- 
215
-P-A-G-E-225
216 PERCEPTION. 
ceiving, we put together certain sensations and thus gain a 
knowledge of objects. 
But this grouping of sensations together is not all we 
do when we perceive. . As long as your sensations seem 
to be sensations, you do not perceive. You perceive only 
when they seem to be what we have seen they are not— 
qualities actually forming a part of the objects in the world 
about us, or states of our own bodies. 
To perceive, then, is to group sensations together and 
regard them as qualities of external objects. But is that 
entirely accurate? When we perceive an apple by the 
sense of sight, we group the sensation of color with recol- 
lections of past sensations — taste, smell, feeling of mellow- 
ness, etc.—do we not? Strictly speaking, then, what we 
do when we perceive is to make a group consisting of one 
or more sensations, and ideas of sensations, and regard the 
group as qualities of an external object. 
The state of mind that results from perception is called 
a percept. We must be careful not to confuse this with 
image. While you are looking at an apple, your state of 
mind ‘is a percept; when you turn your head away and 
think about it, the picture that you form of it is an image. 
In order to reach a percept, the mind must take ‘three 
steps: (I) it must’ be conscious of a definite sensation ; 
(2) it must group this sensation with images of sensations 
already experienced ; and’ (3) it must think of these sen- 
sations ds qualities of objects having a more or less definite 
position in space. — 
To explain the problem of perception, then, is to explain 
how the mind comes to take these three steps, 
T have no intention of attempting to explain. perception. 
It is universally conceded to be one of the nivst difficult

subjects in Psychology. My purpose will be accomplished 
if we can get a definite idea of the problem that a theory 
of perception undertakes to solve, and some general idea 
of what seems to be the true solution. 
Perhaps it will be more convenient to consider the prob- 
lem of perception in ‘the form in which it was stated in the 
last lesson, although the two forms are in fact identical,'as 
a little consideration will enable us to see. 
How the Mind Becomes Conscious of Definite Sensa- 
tions. — (1) How is it that the mind becomes conscious 
of definite sensations — that unindividualized sensations 
come ‘to be individualized, and known a8 such and such 
sensations? That question our study of attention enables 
us to answer. If a child’s experience consisted entirely of 
sensations of sound, it is easy to see that the loudest — 
those Having the character of greatest intensity — would 
be sure to be attended to in the course of time. They 
would stand out in the foreground of his consciousness — 
would be individualized —- and thus lose the indefiniteness 
that characterizes a child’s experiences in the beginnings 
of its mental life. Evidently, also, the pleasurable or 
painful character of its experiences would have the same 
effect, since it is likewise a cause of attention. 
How Sensations Become Localized. —(2) How is it 
that thesé sensations become localized — projected into 
our bodies and into the external world? Very young 
children evidently do not localize their sensations. When 
painful ‘operations are performed upon them, their hands 
do not need to be held, since they do not know where the 
pain is. How do they finally come to get this knowledge?

218 PERCEPTION. 
The Local Sign. — Whether your little finger is pinched, 
or touched, or burned, or bruised, or cut, you locate the 
sensation in it — you know that it is your little finger that is 
affected. How is it that you are able todo this? How 
is it that when such different sensations as those of a mere 
touch, a burn, a bruise, a cut, a pinch, report themselves 
to consciousness, you are able to refer them all to the same 
place? Precisely as you can tell what country an Irish- 
man comes from as soon as you hear him talk. There are 
tall Irishmen and short Irishmen, stout Irishmen and lean 
Irishmen, Irishmen that are handsome and Irishmen that 
are homely; but, no matter how widely they differ in 
appearance, as soon as you hear one talk you know that 
he hails from the land of Erin. And precisely as the 
brogue of an Irishman enables you, as soon as you hear 
him speak, to tell his nationality, so, since we are able to 
locate in the same place the various sensations that arise 
in connection with the little finger, those sensatiofis must 
have some characteristic in common. A mere touch, a 
burn, a bruise, a cut, a pinch, differing as widely as they 
“do, could not be referred to the same place if they did not 
speak a language that betrayed their origin. The charac- 
teristic of our sensations — the brogue which betrays their 
origin — by means of which we are able to locate them, 
first in our bodies, and some of them afterwards in the 
external world, is called the local sign. 
How Local Signs are Apprehended as Signs of Place. 
— But perhaps the first time you noticed the brogue of an 
Irishman you did not know what country he came from. 
If you had noticed it in a dozen or fifty people, without 
knowing they. were from Ireland, you would not have
-P-A-G-E-228
LOCAL SIGNS AS SIGNS OF PLACE, 219 
known that it was a mark of Irish nationality. Not until 
you knew that there was such a country as Ireland, and 
that the men whose brogue you noticed were natives of it, 
could the brogue of an Irishman mean to you what it 
means now. Granted, then, that the sensations we receive 
from the various parts of our bodies have each their own 
local signs, these local signs are still characteristics of sen- 
sations ; how can the mind regard characteristics of sensa- 
tions as signs of what is not sensation? Evidently it is 
possible only as the mind has in some way an idea of the ~ 
thing signified. As a brogue could not mean Irish nation- 
ality if we did not know there is such a country as Ireland, 
so local signs could not be signs of locality if we had no 
idea of space. But the very thing we are trying to explain 
is how unlocalized, unspatialized sensations become local- 
ized. Are we to say that they have local signs, but that, 
in order that these signs may have any meaning, we must 
have the idea of space already? Certainly not; for by 
supposition all that we know is unlocalized sensations. 
But if we had no idea of space defore the apprehension of 
these local signs, and if we must have it in order to use 
them, as we unquestionably do in localizing our sensations, 
the local signs must have been originally apprehended as 
signs of place. You can not explain why a certain brain 
change is followed by sensation; all you can say about it 
is that it is so. Nor can you explain why some of these 
sensations are sensations of color; when we say that it is 
so, we have reached the end of our string. The conclusion 
to which our reasoning leads us is that just as certain 
brain changes are followed by those mental facts which 
we call sensations, so the apprehension of certain charac- 
teristics of our sensations is followed by the apprehension
-P-A-G-E-229
220 PERCEPTION, 
of space. We are able to locate our sensations ; we could 
not do it in the beginning of our mental life; we could 
not locate widely different sensations in the same place if 
they did not have some common characteristic — some 
local sign; this local sign could not be to the mind a sign 
of place unless the idea of place existed before, or began 
to exist at the same time with the apprehension of the 
local sign; the idea of place did not exist before; there- 
Sore it began to exist at the same time with the apprehen- 
sion of the local sign. Why it did we can not tell; but 
everything that we believe rests, in the last analysis, on 
the inexplicable. 
What Local Signs Consist of. — Assuming the exist- 
ence of local signs, and a native power to apprehend them 
as signs of place, we can see how the mind would grad- 
ually form an idea of the place occupied by the body. 
Certain sensations from the various parts of it, each having 
its own local sign, would give an account of the different 
localities where the nerve originated that occasioned them. 
With the idea of the place occupied by his body, the child 
would soon form an idea of the place occupied by bodies 
around him. By grasping first his wrist and then a stick, 
the place-occupying quality of his wrist would naturally be 
transferred to the stick. 
As to what the local signs consist of, there is con- 
siderable diversity of opinion. Indeed, it is a question of 
so much difficulty that the discussion of it is out of place 
in an elementary text. I will merely add that only the sen- 
sations of sight and touch and the muscular sense seem to 
have local signs, seem to possess characteristics that give 
information as to place.
-P-A-G-E-230
GROUPING OF OUR SENSATIONS. 221 
Why do we Group our Sensations together? —(3) How 
do we come to group our sensations together and regard 
them as qualities of external objects ? 
Briefly, because they occur together, or in an invariable 
order. Every moment of our waking. lives we are ex- 
periencing sounds and touches and tastes and smells and 
colors. Those which we are in the habit of experiencing 
together, or in connection with each other, we refer, 
through the influence of the Jaws of association, to the 
same thing. A physician named Cheselden performed an 
operation upon a man who was born blind, which restored 
the man’s sight. When he first began to see, everything 
seemed to touch his eyes. Why? Because we can not 
see distance — because what we call seeing distance is 
interpreting the signs of distance — and he had not then 
learned the signs of distance. He knew cats and dogs 
perfectly by the sense of touch, but he could not dis- 
tinguish them by sight. Why? Because he had not con- 
nected, by the law of association, the way a cat feels with 
the way a cat looks. Looking at a cat one day shortly 
after his sight was restored, and being in doubt as to what 
it was, he caught hold of it and said, “Ah, pussie, I shall 
know you next time.” Why? Because he associated the 
impression she made upon his mind through sight with 
the impression made through touch. A child sees a robin 
on a sunflower,’ and hears it sing. He does not connect 
the odor and color of the sunflower with the color and 
song of the robin, because they do not habitually occur 
together. Tf every time the child saw a sunflower a robin 
was on it, and if he never saw a robin except on a sun- 
1 This illustration was suggested by one of Ward’s in the Eucyclopadia 
Britannica.

222 PERCEPTION. 
flower, he would connect them together as parts of one 
whole. The odor, feel, taste, color, and solidity of an apple 
are all grouped together because they invariably occur 
together. When we have one of these experiences, the law 
of association by contiguity makes us think of the rest. 
Summary. — Summing up, then, (1) Attention to in- 
definite sensations makes them definite — enables us to 
take the first step towards the formation of a percept. 
/ (2) As these sensations become definite, the mind grad- 
ually becomes conscious of local sigzs which some of them 
possess, and by a xative, original power of interpretation 
vefers the sensations possessing them to a certain place. 
V3) Through the laws of association the sensations which 
occur together are referred to the same place and regarded 
as qualities of the same thing.

LESSON XXIV. 
PERCEPTION AND EDUCATION. 
We Create our own Worlds. — Professor Davidson says 
that to a very large extent every human being creates 
his own world. Careful reflection upon the conclusions 
reached in the two preceding lessons will convince us that 
this is true. We are all familiar with the ordinary assump- 
tion that the world exists outside of us, already made, and 
that the senses constitute a sort of transparent medium 
through which it impresses itself upon the mind. But we 
have learned that the material with which the senses origi- 
nally furnish the mind is not a knowledge of the world, is 
not even a knowledge of definite sensations, but an inde- 
scribably confused and mixed-up mass of sentient expe- 
rience, which Professor James has aptly described as 
one “ blooming confusion.” 
The Material. — Now, the gradual transformation of 
this blooming confusion into the world in which each of 
us lives is the mind’s own work. This blooming confusion 
constitutes the bricks out of which the mind erects that 
imposing and stately structure which the senses now seem 
to directly present to us as the world. 
Probably there is no sentence in this book which it will 
be more difficult for most of us cordially to assent to than 
224
-P-A-G-E-234
ILLUSTRATIONS. 225 
this. But, as it seems to me of the first importance that 
we should vividly realize it, I beg to call attention to some 
illustrations of its truth in addition to the arguments of the 
preceding lessons. 
Tlustrations. — We all know that there is a difference 
between the world of the man blind from birth, and that 
of the man who can see; between that of the man deaf 
from birth, and that of the man who can hear. The world 
of the man blind from birth contains no colors; that of 
the deaf man, no sounds. 
As the blind man is shut out from a whole world that 
is open to us, so a man whose sense of sight is highly cul- 
tivated lives in a world into which the ordinary man can 
not enter. He sees a thousand delicate colors, a thousand 
gradations of light and shade, that are as entirely beyond 
the range of the ordinary man’s vision as though they 
came through a new sense. Read Ruskin’s essay on the 
sky and then say if the sky he saw and the sky which we 
see are the same. “Clear” or “cloudy” satisfies us as 
adescription of the sky. That would be as inadequate a 
description of the sky as it would be of a typical American 
to say that he is a human being! 
The same kind of difference exists between the world 
of a man any of whose senses is well trained, and that of a 
man whose corresponding sense is untrained. Read Eve’s 
description of Eden in Milton’s Paradise Lost: 
“ Fragrant the fertile Earth 
‘After soft showers ; and sweet the coming on 
Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night, 
With this her solemn bird, and this fair Moon 
And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train; 
But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends
-P-A-G-E-235
226 PERCEPTION AND EDUCATION. 
With charm of earliest birds; nor rising Sun 
On this delightful land ; nor herb, fruit, flower, 
Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers ; 
Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night, 
With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, 
Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet” — 
Read this and you will note how full Milton’s world was 
of odors — “fragrant the fertile Earth after soft showers” 
—and sounds — “the silent Night,” “charm of earliest 
birds” —and delicate shades of color — ‘and sweet the 
coming on of grateful Evening mild.” For a man who has 
never noticed the fragrance of fertile fields after soft 
showers, who has never noted the gradual dying of the . 
day as grateful evening comes on, who has never been 
charmed by songs of earliest birds, these things are as 
though they did not exist; they form no part of the world 
in which he consciously lives; they are without effect 
upon his mental life. 
We Create our Moral Worlds. —We create in the 
same sense our moral world. We remember some of 
the charges that were brought against Washington in the 
fierce party struggles of his administration — that he 
would not accept any office from 1783 to 1789 because 
there was none exalted enough to satisfy his ambition; 
that his professed wish, not to accept the presidency a 
second term, was a mere pretense made because he was 
afraid he could not be elected ; that the fear that he could 
not be elected caused him to declare that he would not 
accept the presidency for a third term. It is altogether 
possible that many men believed these charges. Men who 
act from motives of self-interest alone can not realize the 
possibility of anything else.
-P-A-G-E-236
PROBLEM OF EDUCATION. 227 
Problem of Education. — The problem of education, 
then, is to help the pupil create the right kind of world, 
such a world as will form the basis for wise thought and 
intelligent action, at the same time that it contributes to 
the noblest pleasures of life. The right kind of so-called 
cultivation of the observing powers consists in helping the 
pupil to note these things which should enter into his 
world, with the hope that by this means he will acquire 
the power to continue the proper creation of his world 
without help from teachers. 
Importance of the Training of Observation. — From 
this point of view, the overmastering importance of the 
training of observation becomes self-evident. Men pay 
great attention to the garments with which they clothe 
their bodies, to the houses with which they shelter them- 
selves. How trifling are these things in value in com- 
parison with the home which the mind must make for 
itself. For the world is the mind’s home. Are we in 
such constant presence of law, order, and rationality as to 
make anything but rational action seem repulsive? Or is 
our world a world of vague and chaotic impressions, where 
things seem to happen by chance? Are we conscious of 
the beauties of sunrise and sunset, of spring and autumn, 
of hill and valley, of meadow and woodland, or are the 
great walls of nature’s picture galleries blank, dreary 
spaces staring upon equally blank and dreary minds? Is 
the life of struggle and toil of the men and women about 
us lighted up for our thinking by some elements of un- 
selfishness, by some bits of heroism, or does it differ from 
a pack of hounds, struggling to get some pieces of meat 
which have been thrown among them, only by some super-
-P-A-G-E-237
228 PERCEPTION AND EDUCATION. 
ficial varnishes called politeness, regard for the opinion of 
others —- which have least influence precisely where they 
‘are needed most? The answer to all these questions de- 
pends on the nature of the world which we have made for 
ourselves. 
How Observation is Cultivated. — When we so con- 
ceive the matter, and when we remember the occupations 
with which the child is afflicted in the average primary 
school — dreary, mechanical memorizing of a lot of dreary, 
unmeaning symbols — we can hardly help congratulating 
ourselves that the laws of most States forbid children to be 
sent to school before the age of six — before they have 
had some of that direct contact with nature which is the 
most potent stimulus to the proper conception of the 
world. Dr. Dewey tells us of a swimming-school in 
Chicago where all the motions are taught on dry land. 
And when a boy who had mastered the theory of swim- 
ming first tried to put it into practice, he was able to 
report the results of his experiment in a single word: 
“sunk.” As well try to teach swimming on dry land, 
bicycling in a carriage, skating in summer as try to help a 
pupil form right conceptions of the world except through 
constant contact with it. Dr. Harris calls Colonel Parker 
the ideal primary teacher, and in Colonel Parker’s school 
the primary pupils spent the greater part of their time 
out-of-doors, 
Opinion of School Authorities. — But this is a waste 
of time, the school authorities are likely to say. They 
think it better for us to employ our pupils in memorizing 
the names of the capitals of the various countries of the
-P-A-G-E-238
OUR PRESENT RESOURCES, . 229 
world, the lengths of the rivers, the heights of the moun- 
tains, and so on. It is our fault that they do. If they 
make a fetich of books, it is because we teachers have 
done so. Let us be convinced ourselves that books are 
only means to ends, and then we can convince the public. 
The difficulty is that we are unable to shake ourselves 
free from the notion that education consists in the knowl- 
edge of books. Instead of regarding books as foot-notes 
to the great texts of nature and mind, we cause our pupils 
to turn away from the study of mind and nature that they 
may give all their time to the study of books. Let us shake 
ourselves free from this burdensome tradition, and then 
we may hope that the general public will become free also. 
Our Present Resources. —- Indeed, in so far as we are 
really convinced of the importance of this first-hand study 
of nature, we are nct without resources even now. If we 
can not take our pupils to nature, we can induce them to 
go and tell us what they have seen. The knowledge that 
they will have to give an account of what they have seen 
will be a motive for observing more carefully than they 
otherwise would have done. And indeed, unless you are 
yourself a loving observer of nature, your company would 
be of little service to them. 
Qualifications of a Good Primary Teacher. — In the 
School of the Far-off Future, when men will universally 
realize the importance of the proper development of the 
various faculties of the mind as keenly as trained physiol- 
ogists to-day realize the importance of the health of the 
various organs of the body, in that school, I believe no 
teacher will be allowed to enter — at least in the primary
-P-A-G-E-239
230 PERCEPTION AND EDUCATION. 
grades — until he has stood certain tests that would seem 
svery curious to us. Is the face of nature indifferent to 
him? Are her smiles in summer and her frowns in winter 
alike lost on him? Can he look upon the brooks that 
“fret” along their channels and the sheep and the cows 
grazing in the meadows and the wild roses growing along 
the hedge-rows and hear the songs of birds with no feel- 
ings of gladness? If so, I believe he will be regarded as 
lacking an essential element of a teacher of boys and girls. 
The ideal teacher of the ideal schooi will look on the face 
of nature with something of the same fondness with which 
the mother looks on the face of her child. As every act 
of her child is an object of interest to the mother, so every 
detail of nature will be of interest to this teacher, and he 
will watch the changes that pass over the face of nature 
as winter gives way to spring, and spring to summer, and 
summer gradually dies away into autumn, with something 
of the same sad and yet fond interest which the mother 
bestows upon her daughter as she travels on the road to 
womanhood. 
What Children should be Taught to Observe. — But 
we are not living in the future, and we have to take our- 
selves as we do our pupils — as we are, and make the best 
of us. And it seems to me that if we do not care for 
nature we may realize the importance of helping our pupils 
care for it; and to do this, the only thing we can do is to 
give them motives for attending to it more closely than 
they otherwise would -have done. You might have them 
make lists of the various trees and flowers and plants and 
birds of the neighborhood, and note the dates when the 
trees begin to put forth their leaves and the flowers to
-P-A-G-E-240
DRAWING. 231 
bloom and the birds to build their nests. If the birds are 
of a migratory sort, you should have your pupils observe 
when they come and when they go, and, in any case, what 
they feed on, and how they build their nests. You should 
have a school museum composed entirely of interesting 
objects that they have collected. In such ways you may 
induce them to become familiar with every bird and tree 
and flower and plant in the neighborhood, and during the 
process three-fourths of them will have acquired such an 
interest in nature as will make them good observers for life. 
Drawing. — You can turn their fondness for drawing 
mto account in the same direction. Have them draw not 
pictures, but real objects from memory, and the result will 
be that the next time the object is seen it will be observed 
much more closely, and the image of it will be fixed in the 
mind much more definitely. 
Object Lessons. — You should give object lessons. But 
if these lessons are to have any value, they must be care- 
fully prepared and carefully given. Some teachers seem 
to imagine that there is a virtue in an object lesson as 
such; but, in the nature of the case, this is not so. If an 
object lesson: is of any use in cultivating the observing 
powers of your pupils, it is because it induces them to 
observe more closely than they otherwise would have done; 
if it does not do that, it will leave their observing powers 
just where it found them. . 
An object lesson may be made to serve two important 
purposes besides furnishing motives to your pupils to ob- 
serve: You may make it a means of imparting knowledge, 
and of enlarging the range of their vocabulary. |
-P-A-G-E-241
232 PERCEPTION AND EDUCATION. 
Preparation of Object Lessons. — When you are pre- 
paring an object lesson, you should make up your mind in 
precisely what ways you will reach these various ends. 
‘You will, of course, conduct it for the most part by asking 
questions. If you are dealing with little children, you will 
‘begin by asking them questions which they can answer 
with ease, for the sake of interesting them in the lesson. 
Children like to display their powers, and they like lessons 
which give them opportunities to do that. But you will 
be careful to note that to interest them in the lesson zs dy 
no means the same thing as interesting them in the object. 
You interest them in the object when you ask them 
questions about it that they can not answer, but to which 
they can find the answer by more careful observation. 
Accordingly, a part of your preparation of an object lesson 
should consist of such a careful study of the object as will 
enable you to observe certain qualities which you think 
have escaped their attention, in order that you may be able 
to induce them to study it more carefully than they have 
ever done before, and give them the pleasure of finding 
out something for themselves. 
You should carefully decide also precisely to what extent 
you wish to enlarge their vocabulary. If, for instance, you 
are giving a lesson on glass, you can arrange your ques- 
tions so as to get them to tell you that they can see through 
it, Then you can tell them that things which can be seen 
through are transparent, and ask them to name as many 
transparent things as they can think of. 
Compayre quotes a sensible paragraph from M. Buisson 
on this subject: “It is not desirable to have the object 
lesson begin and end at a fixed hour. Let it be given on 
the occasion of a reading or writing lesson, or in connec.

LESSON XXvV. 
MEMORY. 
Elements of Memory.— We can conceive of a mind 
with no capacity except the power to experience sensations 
—a mind limited to the present—-a mind whose expe- 
riences leave no trace upon it. Such a mind would be 
destitute of the power of retention. We can conceive of 
a mind like our own in that every sensation, every expe- 
rience leaves “the mind different, as every physical change 
leaves. the body different,” but unlike ours in that an 
experience once gone never returns. As every minute in 
that stately and solemn procession that we call the March 
of the Years goes by never to return, so we can conceive 
that the shadow of those experiences that we are conscious 
of from moment to moment, in spite of the fact that each 
of them left the mind different, might never fall across our 
conscious life. Such a mind would be without the power 
of reproduction. We can conceive of a mind, also; with 
laws of association like our own —a mind constantly con- 
scious of images of some of its past experiences, but with- 
out the faintest notion that they were tmages-—a mind 
with the power to make pictures or copies of past events, 
but without the power to refer them to their original. 
Such a mind would be destitute of the power of recogui- 
tion —re-knowing. Or we can conceive of a mind with 
234
-P-A-G-E-244
RETENTION. 235 
the power to reproduce and re-know its past experiences, 
but without the power to locate them — a mind to which 
“yesterday,” “last week,” “last month,” “last year,” 
would mean the same thing —the past, —a mind all 6f 
whose recollections were like those we have sometimes 
been conscious of when we have seen a face that we were 
suve we had seen before, but with no idea of where or 
when. Such a mind would be without the power of - 
Localization." 
These four powers, then—retention, reproduction, 
recognition, and localization — constitute the power that 
we Call memory. You would not, indeed, say that you 
do not remember a thing when you are not thinking about 
it. But you would say that a mind that did not ‘possess 
all four of these powers can not remember as we can, and 
that.one without the last two can not remember at all. 
A complete explanation of memory, then, would require 
a complete explanation of these four powers. 
Retention. — In thinking about retention, we must be 
on our guard against being led into mistakes by the literal 
meaning of the word. The act of retaining seems to imply 
a place where things are retained, and so we sometimes 
permit ourselves to think of memory asa great storehouse, 
where all the lumber of our past experience is accumulated. 
_ This was the opinion of Herbart. Says the Herbartian, 
Lindner: “That concepts are not destroyed by . passing 
out of consciousness is proved by the fact of reproduction.” 
And Leibniz: “No idea leaves the mind, but each idea 
becomes invisible for a time or permanently, To remem- 
ber is to have new consciousness of what has not ceased 
1 See Baldwin’s Psychology, p. 151. 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
236 MEMORY. 
to exist in the soul.” But when we begin to think seri- 
ously, it is hard to believe that the “storehouse” of 
memory is more than a metaphor. I had the toothache 
yesterday ; to-day I recall the fact. I have an image of it. 
But the image or idea of the toothache is not the original 
fact. The toothache was intensely painful; the image of 
it is not at all so. Jf you ask where the image was from 
the time it dropped out of consciousness until the time we 
thought of it to-day, the proper answer is, as Baldwin 
says, Nowhere. When I had the toothache, I was con- 
scious of a sensation. When I ceased to have it, the 
sensation ceased. "When the idea of it is recalled to my 
mind, I remember it. Between the disappearance of the 
sensation and the rise of the image my mind was inactive 
with reference to it; there was neither sensation nor image 
of it in existence. So far as consciousness is concerned, 
then, retention does not denote an act, but states a fact — 
the fact that experiences of the past leave the mind differ- 
ent, since it often happens that we can recall them. ie 
Retention a Physical Fact. — The probability is that 
retention is, in part at least, a purely physical fact. The 
facts already cited in an earlier chapter —6f impairment 
of memory in consequence of an injury to the brain — 
indicate this. Ribot states the argument very forcibly: 
“Tf, with closed eyes, we keep for a length of time an 
image of very lively colors before the imagination, and 
then opening the eyes suddenly, we fix them upon a white 
surface, we see thereon for .an instant the image contem- 
plated in imagination, but in che complementary color. 
This fact, as is observed by Wundt, from whom we borrow 
it, proves that the nerve action is the same in the two
-P-A-G-E-246
LAWS OF ASSOCIATION. 237 
cases-—in the sense perception and in the memory.” 
Professor Ladd also puts the case clearly: “That the 
mental phenomena which lead us to speak of the retentive 
power of memory have a physical basis, there can be no 
doubt. . . . Every sensory impulse must produce changes 
both in the end organs and the central organs; and 
although these changes vanish, so far as their effect in the 
corresponding phenomena of conscious mind is concerned, 
they nevertheless can not fail to leave the organs in dif- 
ferent condition from that in which they were found.”* 
Fouillée makes a concise and graphic statement of some 
of the facts that support this opinion: “It is evident that 
there is in memory something automatic, capable of func-_ 
tioning alone; even the diseases and illusions to which it is 
subjéct prove that there is something delicate and fragile 
in this marvel of natural mechanism. If a scholar, after 
having received a violent blow on the head, forgets all his 
knowledge of Greek without forgetting anything else, and 
if afterwards, as the result of a second blow, he suddenly. 
regains his lost Greek, it is difficult to see in memory an 
act entirely spiritual.” 
Reproduction and Laws of Association. — The laws 
in accordance with which ideas and images of our past 
experiences arise in our minds have already been con- 
sidered. They are, as we know, the laws of association. 
We say that any thought, idea, or experience tends to 
recall similar thoughts, ideas, or experiences, and all other 
thoughts or experiences that were in the mind at the same 
time. 
A consideration of this law will enable us to see how it 
1 Ladd’s Physiological Psychology, p. 548
-P-A-G-E-247
238 MEMORY. 
happens that we are sometimes conscious of re-knowing 
things without being able to recall the place where, or the 
time when, the thing was originally known, or any of the 
circumstances connected with it. It is because the thing 
recalls the past experience s7mply by the law of association 
by similarity. Usually, as we know, along with ‘the similar 
idea are recalled other ideas or thoughts that were in the 
mind at the same time; and it is these other thoughts or 
ideas that enable us to /oca/ize our recollections. You saw 
a stranger yesterday in the post-office. To-day you see 
him again, and as soon as you see him you are conscious 
of that. feeling of recognition — you know that you have 
seen him before. How do you know it? Because of the 
likeness between your percept of him and the image that 
arises in the mind. But suppose the image comes entirely 
unattended — suppose it comes without any of the other 
ideas that were in the mind at the same time — then you 
will have the feeling that you are re-knowing the person, 
. but where or when you originally knew fim you will be 
utterly unable to tell. You will not know where, for by 
supposition the image of the post-office does not come into 
your mind with the image of the person you saw there. 
You will not know when, for none of the images or 
thoughts that fix the time come with the image — no 
thought of yesterday, no thought of what you were or had 
been doing. As we can not locate the place of a thing 
except in relation to other places — London in relation to 
England, England to Europe, Europe to the earth, the 
earth to the solar system, the solar system to the universe, 
the universe to what? — so we can not locate the time of 
an event except with reference to the time of other events, 
succeeding, preceding, or contemporaneous. (What does
-P-A-G-E-248
PRESENT IMAGES AS PAST EXPERIENCES. 239 
1891 mean?) When, therefore, an image of a past ex- 
perience arises in our minds, unattended by any of its 
former companions, we car only feel that we re-know it, 
without being able to tell where or when. 
How we Know that Present Images are Copies of 
Past Experiences. — This explanation of the fact would 
seem to make the explanation of our ordinary experiences 
in memory very simple. Usually when we see a thing a 
second time that we remember to have seen before, we 
remember when and where we saw it. The reason is, as 
we now see, that the image of the past fact is attended by 
some of the ideas that were in the mind at the same time, 
so that its place and time are fixed. But how do we know 
that images of which we are conscious in the present are 
copies of experiences that we had an hour ago, or rather 
what makes us believe it? You sit down and begin to 
indulge in the pleasure of retrospection. You think of 
what happened an hour ago, yesterday, last year, ten years 
ago — when you were a child, first, finding yourself in this 
strange world. But your base of operations is always the 
present. How is it that ideas xow in the mind are retro- 
jected, some of them an hour back, others a day, others a 
year, others a decade, others for a period not to be men- 
tioned in such a public place? Precisely as in perception, 
we refer some of the sensations of color to objects ten feet 
away, others to objects a mile — ten miles — away, while 
all of them are in our-own minds, so in memory we retro- 
ject ideas, all of which are experiences of the present, 
some of them an hour, others a day, others a week, others 
a score of years into our past lives. As Mr. Ward puts it, 
“We may, if we represent succession as a line, represent 
a”
-P-A-G-E-249
240 MEMORY. 
simultaneity as a second line at right angles to the first.” 
As our experiences actually occur to us, they are in suc- 
cession, the memory images of them at any one time are 
in the mind simultaneously. How are we able to retroject 
present memory images into that place in the past occu- 
pied by the experiences of which they are the copies? 
Temporal Signs. —-It is the case of the Irishman’s 
brogue over again. As we know the nationality of, an 
Irishman by the way he speaks; as we refer our sensa- 
tions to a certain place by their local signs; so we locate 
images of past experiences at a certain point in our past 
lives by their zemporal signs. As the local signs are certain 
characteristics that all sensations, however different, which 
arise from the stimulation of the same part of the body 
have in common, so the temporal signs are certain common 
characteristics possessed by all ideas that we refer to some 
general point of time, however different those ideas may 
be. In other words, all the events of Christmas Day, 
1888, that I am able to recall and localize at that point in 
the past are represented in my mind by ideas or images 
that have certain common characteristics. These common 
characteristics — this brogue that enables me to refer my 
recollections to their proper time in the past — are called 
temporal signs.

LESSON XXVL 
THE CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY. 
Rules for Remembering. — Bearing in mind our con- 
clusion that the basis of memory is in part physical, it is 
but a step to the further conclusion that whatever is 
learned in a state of excellent bodily health, other things 
being equal, is most likely to be remembered. Facts of 
every-day experience confirm this view. We all know how 
likely we are to forget things that we learn when we are 
suffering from a headache, indigestion, or the like. 
Health and Memory.— Says a popular writer, Mr. 
Halleck: “The first rule for securing a better memory is 
to pay attention to the laws of hygiene, to endeavor by all 
means to keep the health at high-water mark.” 
Attention and Memory.— Another rule, equally con- 
firmed by daily observation, is: Attend carefully and 
closely to the facts you wish to remember. We have seen 
in a previous chapter how much memory depends on atten- 
tion, and we know how much it depends on interest. But 
interest in a subject increases the power to remember it 
chiefly through the influence of interest on attention: 
Many of us find it hard to remember faces. This difficulty 
242
-P-A-G-E-252
DRAWING AND MEMORY OF FORM, 243 
would be lessened if we carefully noted the faces of people © 
we wish to remember. 
Drawing and Memory of Form.— Every teacher 
knows how the drawing of objects tends to fix their form 
in the mind. The reason is that in drawing objects we 
must attend to them. Sir Francis Galton says that M. 
Boisbaudran trained the visual memory of his pupils with 
extraordinary success. His method was to have his pupils 
study “the models thoroughly before they tried to draw 
them from memory. One favorite expedient was to asso- 
ciate the sight memory with the muscular memory by 
making his pupils follow at a distance the outlines of the 
figures with a pencil held in-their hands. After three or 
four months’ practice, their visual memory became greatly 
strengthened. They had no difficulty in summoning images 
at will, in holding them steady, and in drawing them.” 
Understanding and Memory. — A third rule for facili- 
tating the acquisition of memory is: Get a clear compre- 
hension of the thing you wish to remember. The famous 
experiments of Elbringhaus illustrate this in a striking 
way. He found that he could memorize a stanza of poetry 
in about one tenth of the time required to memorize the 
same amount of nonsense syllables. I asked a capable 
student of Johns Hopkins University some years ago to 
give me an account of a lecture he had just listened to. 
“Tcan not do it,” was his reply. “It was not logical.” 
Association and Memory. — The last example belongs, 
perhaps, with more propriety under the fourth and most 
important rule; Multiply associations, entangle the fact you — — a
-P-A-G-E-253
244 CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY. 9 \— - 
wish to remember in a net of as many associations as pos 
sible, especially those that are logical. 
In studying the association of ideas, we saw that 
mechanical association is that kind of association in con- 
sequence of which anything we are thinking of tends to 
make us think of something else we thought of at or about 
the same time; logical or rational association, that which 
tends to make us think of something between which and 
the thing we are thinking of the mind has perceived inner 
relations. : 
Educational Value of Mechanical Association. — We 
only need to call to mind instances of the former to-realize 
its comparative educational value. Consider, for example, 
the following : “Thou didst swear to me, upon a parcel- 
gilt goblet, sitting in my dolphin chamber, at the round 
table, by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Whitsun week, 
when the prince broke thy head for liking his father toa 
singing man of Windsor ; thou didst swear to me then, as 
I was washing thy wound, to marry me, and make me my 
lady thy wife.’ — Henry IV. This, of course, is an ex- 
ample of mechanical association, and it enables us to 
realize that, so far as our thoughts are controlled by that 
kind of association, they will be directed by chance and 
accident rather than intelligence. 
When your pupils associate things logically, they ‘are 
exercising and therefore developing the higher powers of 
their minds, 
Of Logical Association. — Logical or rational associa- 
tion is association according to some inner relation But 
before this relation can form the basis of an association it 
‘
-P-A-G-E-254
LOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 245 
must be apprehended, and this act of apprehension is an 
exercise of the higher powers of the mind. Fitch says that 
the difference between a wise man and one who is not wise 
consists less in the things he knows than in the way he 
knows them. The wise man knows things in their rela- 
tions, I think he would say, has his knowledge classified, 
has associated what he knows rationally. In the same 
paragraph he observes that an historical fact is learned to 
little purpose unless it is seen in its bearing on some 
political, economical, or moral law. Jam sure you agree 
with ‘him. We all know that a teacher may know facts 
enough about history to pass an ordinary examination very 
creditably, and yet know them to very little purpose 
because he knows them in a purely mechanical way. 
Logical Association Increases the Interest. — An- 
other reason for helping our pupils cultivate their logi- 
cal memory is that they are more interested in what 
they have associated logically. To learn facts by means 
of the mechanical memory is an irksome task; to ap- 
prehend the relations between those facts, to associate 
them logically is a delightful labor, especially if the 
pupil has been led to discern for himself the rela- 
tions which form the basis of the association. Now 
interest, as we know, is a great help to the memory. But 
apart from that it is quite as important for you to interest 
your pupils for other reasons. If we interest our pupils, 
we do what we can to make them students for life, and 
that.is a much more. important matter than having them 
learn well any particular subject. Indeed, I think you-will 
admit that if we had to choose between having our pupils 
careless and indifferent to study at school, and having
-P-A-G-E-255
246 CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY. 
them studious through life, it would be entirely wise for 
us to choose the latter. « 
Makes Knowledge Usable. — Another reason for cul- 
tivating the logical memory is that any one with that kind 
of memory can use what he knows. Some one has said 
that a man could not stand under a tree with Edmund 
Burke during a shower of rain without perceiving that he 
was in the company of a very remarkable man. The 
reason doubtless was, not that Burke was continually say- 
ing brilliant or witty things, but that he said nothing that 
was not to the point. A man may know a great deal 
mechanically, and yet be unable to use his knowledge, 
because he can not think of anything when he wants it, 
and can not see how he can use it when he does think of 
it. Such a person’s mind is like a well-filled scrap bag; 
there is a good deal in it, but everything is in such dis- 
order that you have to turn it upside down before you can 
get any particular thing out of it. 
You have doubtless heard the saying, “ Great memory, 
little wit.” :J think we can now see what truth there is 
in it. It is altogether possible for a person to have a great 
mechanical memory and have very little mind besides. 
Indeed, there are plenty of cases on record in which idiots 
have shown remarkable power of remembering facts me- 
chanically. But to have a fine logical memory and a poor 
mind is an impossibility. 
Mechanical Memory of Many Educated Persons, — 
Educated persons often complain that their memory is not 
so good as it was in their youth. What they mean is that 
their mechanical memory is not so good. They have
-P-A-G-E-256
PLACE FOR THE MECHANICAL MEMORY. 247 
acquired the very excellent habit of fixing their attention 
on important matters and neglecting the trivial events 
that are not worth remembering ; and because they forget - 
them, while their uneducated friends remember them, 
they imagine that their memory suffers by comparison. 
But it is not so. The educated man cultivates his logical 
memory, and neglects, for the most part, his mechanical 
memory ; while the uneducated man does the exact opposite. 
It is natural, therefore, for the uneducated to have better 
mechanical memories than the educated.’ As Dr. Harris 
observes, if we want the child’s memory we cam have it. 
We can force ourselves to ignore the difference between 
the important and the unimportant, and attend impartially 
to everything that comes before us. So far as we succeed, , 
in doing this, we shall remember important and unimpor- 
tant matters with equal accuracy. But is such a memory ' 
desirable? No, because in that case we shall remember 
important matters less accurately than we should have 
done otherwise. . 
But I do not mean to convey the impression that every- 
thing can be learned by means of the. logical memory. 
Logical association consists in connecting facts together 
by means of some inner relation. But before we can see 
the relations between facts, we must know the facts them- 
selves, 
Place for the Mechanical Memory. — For this reason 
there is a place for the mechanical memory in education. 
But here you should note that there are as many different 
memories, so to speak, as there are kinds of facts to be 
remembered. There is a memory of colors, a memory of 
dates, a memory of rocks, and so on. ‘You know very
-P-A-G-E-257
248 CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY. 
well that some of your pupils have ari excellent memory 
for geography, others for grammar, others for history, and 
so on. 
No such Thing as the Universal Cultivation of the 
Memory. — Now, since memory is not one faculty, but 
many, it follows that there is no such thing as a universal 
‘cultivation of the memory. If you find your memory weak 
in any particular direction, what you ought to do is to 
practice it on the kind of things you find most difficulty in 
remembering. Dr. Harris gives an interesting and instruc- 
tive account of his own efforts in cultivating his mechanical 
memory. When he was about eighteen, he tells us, he had 
great difficulty in remembering dates. He cultivated his 
memory for them in the following manner: The first day 
he learned the dates of accession of three or four English 
kings; the next day he learned two or three more, and 
reviewed those he learned the preceding day; the next 
day, again reviewing from the beginning, he added two or 
three more to the list, and so on, until he had thoroughly 
learned the entire list. After two or three months he 
found he had forgotten some of them, so he learned them 
again ; and after two or three years he repeated the opera- 
tion. By such training, he tells us, his memory for dates 
was so improved that he has never since had any trouble 
in remembering such dates as he cared to remember. He 
cultivated his memory for names in a similar way. 
When Verbal Memorizing is Desirable. — It follows 
that verbal memorizing, although mechanical memorizing, 
is not necessarily bad. On the contrary, under certain 
circumstances it is essential. Fitch has stated with great
-P-A-G-E-258
USES OF THE MECHANICAL MEMORY. 249° 
clearness the circumstances under which it is valuable: 
“When the object is to have thoughts, facts, reasonings 
reproduced, seek to have them reproduced in the pupil’s 
own words. Do not set the faculty of mere verbal mem. 
ory to work. But when the words themselves in which a 
fact is embodied have some special fitness or beauty of 
their own — when they represent some scientific datum 
or central truth, which could not otherwise be se well 
expressed —then see that the form as well as the sub- 
stance of the expression is learned by heart.” Compayre, 
commenting on this, says that, “according to this, it is 
easy to fix the limit which verbal repetition should not 
pass. In grammar, the principal rules; in arithmetic, the 
definitions; in geometry, the theorems; in the sciences 
in general, the formulas; in history, a few summaries; in 
geography, the explanation of a few technica} terms; in 
ethics, a few maxims—these are the things which the 
child ought to know word for word — on the; condition, of 
course, that he perfectly understands the meaning of what 
he recites, and that his attention is called not less to the 
thought than to the form of the expression.” To this I 
would add that no week should be allowed to pass by in 
which the pupil is not encourage‘ to learn, word for word, 
some beautiful sentence or paragraph, and thus store his 
mind with beautiful thoughts, beautifully expressed. 
Danger of Underrating the Uses of the Mechanical 
Memory. —In the healthy reaction against the mechani- 
cal methods in vogue half a century ago, we are in danger 
of undervaluing the mechanical memory, especially in con- 
rection with literature.’ We are apt to think that if a 
pupil has a thought the form in which he holds it is a
-P-A-G-E-259
250 CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY. 
matter of no consequence. Says Professor Davidson : “We 
are inclined to be content if we can get information rapidly 
and easily into the heads of our pupils, and trouble our- 
selves very little about the manner in which it is accom- 
plished. The Greeks were wiser. They knew that the 
how is more important than the wat, that conceptions 
which are presented to the mind clothed in poetic light 
and heat are far more readily assimilated and retained, and 
exercise a far deeper and more lasting influence upon the 
imagination, the feelings, and the will, than those which 
come to it in the cold gray garb of ordinary prose.” 
Difficulty of Making a Practical Application of the 
Pedagogical Principles in Connection with Memory. — 
And now I have said substantially what I intended about 
mechanical and rational association, and mechanical and 
rational memory. I believe we shall agree that, of all the 
subjects within the whole range of Psychology, there is 
scarcely one of more practical importance. We are con- 
stantly making use of the memory of our pupils. How we 
make use of it is the question, the answer to which largely 
determines the quality of our work. But however clearly 
we understand the difference between logical and mechani- 
cal memory, and the circumstances under which each ought 
to be cultivated, I am afraid we shall have difficulty in 
putting our ideas into practice. Why? Because we can 
not help our pupils associate facts logically until they are 
so associated in our own minds. Pestalozzi thought that 
it was possible to mechanize instruction so perfectly that 
any teacher who had mastered the mechanism could suc- 
ceed. He was profoundly mistaken, not merely because 
a mechanism will not run itself — because a method, how-
-P-A-G-E-260
ARITHMETIC AND HISTORY. 251 
ever excellent, needs various adaptations to various cases 
—but because good teaching is impossible without an -~ 
ample and rational knowledge of the subject of instruction. 
Illustrated by Arithmetic and History. — As long as 
the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 
whole numbers seem to be entirely disconnected opera- 
tions, and each of these entirely disconnected from the 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of com- 
mon fractions, and these from the same operations in deci- 
mal fractions, we can not enable our pupils to associate the 
facts of arithmetic rationally, because they are not so asso- 
ciated in our own mind. Jn like manner, as long as we 
see no connection between the very different kinds of 
people who settled at Plymouth and Jamestown, and the 
differences between the people of Massachusetts and the 
people of Virginia at the close of the Revolutionary War ; 
as long as we see no connection between these differences 
and their reluctance to unite together under a single strong 
government ; as long as we do not see how this reluctance 
could only be overcome by compromises in the Constitu- 
tion which were in the nature of contradictions, which 
contradictions, under the influence of slavery, led to other 
contradictions —- each party affirming its own view with 
passionate intensity-— and these to the Civil War — until 
we see these things as clearly as the sun in the noonday 
heavens, American history is a sealed book to us, and it 
will be a sealed book to our pupils so far as help from us 
is concerned, because the facts are associated in our own 
minds in a merely mechanical way. In like manner, until 
we realize in detail to what extent the character, history, 
and institutions of a people are a matter of latitude, and
-P-A-G-E-261
  252 CULTIVATION OF THE MEMORY. 
longitude, and soil, and climate; until we see that the 
explanation of the building of a Chicago in fifty years is 
to be found in the facts of physical geography; until we 
see that, if the soil and climate and other physical condi- 
tions of the North and South had been reversed, the parts 
they played in the Civil War would have been reversed — 
we can not teach geography properly, because we do not 
know geography in a rational or logical way. 
In a word, to make a practical use of this distinction 
between logical and mechanical memory, it is not enough 
to understand it. We must know the subjects we under- 
take to teach in a logical or rational way, and the latter is 
as indispensable as the former.

ma’am, leeks and barley; I sha’n’t forget.” “Then I want a shoulder 
of mutton, a pound of tea, a pound of coffee, and six pounds of sugar. 
And as you go by the dressmaker’s, tell her she must bring out calico 
for the lining, some black thread, and a piece of narrow tape.” “Yes, 
ma'am,” says Betty, preparing to depart. “Oh, at the grocer’s get 
a jar of black currant jam,” adds the mistress, The farmer, who has 
been quietly listening to this conversation, calls Betty back when she 
has started, and asks her what she is going to do in town. “Well, 
sir, I’m going to get tea, sugar, a shoulder of mutton, coffee, coffee — 
let me see, there’s something else.” “That won’t do,” said the farmer; 
“you must arrange the things as the parson does his sermon, under 
different heads, or you won’t remember them. Now, you have three 
things to think of —- breakfast, dinner, and dressmaker.” “Yes, sir.” 
“What are you going to get for breakfast?” ‘Tea and coffee and 
sugar and jam,” says Betty. “Where do you get these things?” 
“At the grocer’s,” “Very well. Now what will be the things put 
on the table at dinner?” “There'll be broth, meat, and pudding.” 
“Now what have you to get for each of these?” “For the broth I 
have to get leeks and barley, for the meat I have to get a shoulder of 
mutton, and for the pudding I must get suet and currants.” “Very 
good. Where will you get these things?” «1 must get the leeks at 
the gardener’s, the mutton and suet at the butcher’s, and the barley 
and currants at the grocer’s.” « But you had something else to get 
at the grocer’s.” “Yes, sir, the things for breakfast—tea, coffee, 
Sugar, and jam.” “Very well. Then at the grocer’s you have four

things to get for breakfast and two for dinner. When you go to the 
grocer’s, think of one part of his counter as your breakfast table and 
another part as your dinner table, and go over the things wanted for 
breakfast and the things wanted for dinner. Then you will remember 
‘he four things for breakfast and the two for dinner. Then you will 
have two other places to go for the dinner. What are they?” “The 
gardener’s for leeks, and the butcher’s for meat and suet.” « Very 
well. That is three of the places. What is the fourth?” “The 
dressmaker’s to tell her to bring out calico, and thread, and tape for 
the dress.” “ Now,” said her master, “I think you can tell me every- 
thing you are going for.” “Yes,” said Betty; “I’m going to the 
grocer’s, the butcher’s, and the gardener’s. At the grocer’s I’m going 
to get tea, coffee, sugar, and jam for breakfast, and barley and cur- 
_ rants for dinner. But then I shall not have all the things for dinner, 
so I must go to the butcher’s for a shoulder of mutton and suet, and 
for leeks to the gardener’s. Then I must call at the dressmaker’s to 
tell her to bring lining, tape, and thread for the dress.” Off goes Betty 
and does everything she has todo. «Never tell us again,” said her

a LESSON XXVII. 
IMAGINATION. 
Definition of Imagination. — If you ever watched the 
growth of the mind of a child, you doubtless noticed that 
he seemed to remember persons before he showed any 
signs of thinking of them when they are absent. A child 
shows.in the most unmistakable ways that he remembers 
his father and mother some time before he gives any evi- 
dence of thinking of them when they are away. The power 
of the mind to form ideas of things not present is called 
imagination. ~ 
What is an Image ?—- We may call imagination the 
image-making faculty, if we give a broad enough meaning 
to image. We can think not only of absent persons, but 
of tastes, touches, hopes, fears, etc., no longer experienced. 
If, then, we define imagination as the image-making faculty, 
we must remember that an image is the mental represen- 
tation of any experience whatever. 
Two Kinds of Imagination. — There are two kinds of 
imagination. When a child cries for his absent mamma, 
the act of imagination evidently consists in holding before 
the mind a copy, more or less faithful, of the mother, as 
seen and known. But the same child will soon think of 
255
-P-A-G-E-265
256 IMAGINATION. 
things he has never seen — of things that have never come 
within the range of his experience. He will tell you of 
what he will do when he becomes a bird, or of good little 
girls putting a cat’s eyes in after a bad dog has scratched 
them out-—and much besides of the same sort. The first 
kind of imagination is called_remindscent or reproductive, 
since it reproduces past experiences; the second is called 
constructive, since it takes ideas or images furnished by 
the reproductive imagination and combines them into new 
wholes. 
Difference between Reproductive Imagination and 
Memory. — “But what is the difference,” you at once 
ask, “between reproductive imagination and memory? 
I hear a song, and it makes me think of the friend whom I 
heard sing it a few days ago; an image of my friend as 
singing the song rises before my mind. This, I suppose, 
is both an act of memory and reproductive imagination; 
what is the difference between the two?” : 
To begin with, in its early stages, memory exists with- 
out imagination. A child who knows his mamma when he 
sees her, but can not think of her when she is absent, 
illustrates this. , 
“ But when he begins to think of his absent mammi’, as 
he will by and by, what, then, is the difference between 
memory and reproductive imagination ? Wher he thinks 
about her, does he not remember her, and is not his 
thought of her an image, and therefore the product of the 
imagination?” Yes; but there is a difference between 
simply thinking of hex, or rather between simply having 
the image of her tn his mind, and knowing that image 
as the image of one he has seen. ‘The difference between
-P-A-G-E-266
REPRODUCTIVE IMAGINATION. 257 
reproductive imagination and constructive imagination is 
that the images resulting from reproductive imagination 
are copies of past experiences, while those resulting from 
constructive imagination are not. Now, it is altogether 
possible for one to suppose that what are really products 
of reproductive imagination are products of constructive 
imagination, because the images resulting from the act of 
reproductive imagination are not accompanied by a recol- 
lection of the original experiences. 
We shall see the relation between them from another 
point of view if we remember that the exercise of the 
reproductive imagination is a part, of which the memory of 
an absent object is the whole. There can be no memory 
of an absent object unless the image of it is in the mind, 
and that image is the product of the reproductive imagina- 
tion. But having the image of an absent object, and 
remembering the object, are not the same. There is no 
complete act of memory of an absent object until the image 
in the mind is recognized as the image of some particular 
object or thing already experienced. Moreover, while a 
complete act of memory of an absent object involves 
retention, reproduction, recognition, and localization, the 
imagination of it requires but two—retention and repro- 
_ duction. If the image of a past object or experience comes 
unattended by any of the images that formed a part of its 
-original escort, it can not be localized —z.e., completely 
remembered —nevertheless it is imagined. Also, it may 
aot be recognized ; even then it is imagined. 
We saw in the last lesson that there is no such thing 
as a single faculty of memory; that we ought to speak of 
the memories rather than of the memory of the mind, 
since we have as many memories as there are classes of
-P-A-G-E-267
258 IMAGINATION, 
facts to be remembered. The same is true of the imagina- 
tion. Mr. Galton has done more perhaps than any other 
man to impress this fact upon the world. He sent outa 
long series of questions, the first group of which related 
to the illumination, definition, and coloring of the mental 
image, and were framed as follows: 
“ Before addressing yourself to any of the Questions on 
the opposite page, think of some definite object — suppose 
it is your breakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning 
—and consider carefully the picture that rises before your 
mind’s eye. . 
“1. Illumination. —Is the image dim or fairly clear? 
Is its brightness comparable to that of the actual scene? 
“2. Definition.— Are all the objects pretty well defined 
at the same time, or is the place of sharpest definition at 
any one moment more contracted than it is in a real scene? 
“3. Coloring.— Are the colors of the china, of the toast, 
bread-crust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have 
been on the table, quite distinct and natural?” 
The answers to these questions revealed the interesting 
fact that the clearness, and definiteness, and vividness of 
the images in men’s mind vary in the most remarkable 
way from individual to individual. 
Influence of the Will upon Imagination. — There is 
not a moment when images of one sort or another are not 
in our minds. Sometimes we ourselves determine to a 
considerable extent their character. As Dr. Reid said, 
“We seem to treat the thoughts that present themselves 
to the fancy” — imagination — “in crowds as a great man 
treats the courtiers who attend at his levee. They are all 
ambitious of his attention. He goes round the circle.
-P-A-G-E-268
CONSTRUCTIVE IMAGINATION, 259 
bestowing a bow upon one, a smile upon another, asks a 
short question of a third, while a fourth is honored with 
a particular conference ; and the greater part have no par- 
ticular mark of attention, but go as they came. It is true 
he can give no mark of his attention to those who were 
not there, but he has a sufficient number for making a 
choice and a distinction.” If those who were treated so 
coolly had at once left, while those upon whom the great 
man smiled had stayed till some of their friends and rela- 
tives — whom they themselves summoned because of their 
kind treatment — were honored at their expense, the case 
would exactly illustrate the influence that we exert, when- 
ever we choose, over the character of the images that . 
throng through our minds. Those that we do not attend 
to, vanish; those that we do attend to, stay until we neglect | 
them for the sake of those that come into our minds through | 
their connection with them. 
But sometimes the will abdicates, and lets one’s thoughts 
take their own course. As the rider of a trusty horse 
might throw the reins on his neck, and let him wander at 
will across fields, through woods, over meadows, so we 
sometimes give full rein to our thoughts, and let them take - 
us where they will. If we break in upon any such state 
for the purpose of making a study of it, I think that we 
shall usually find that the images in our minds are the 
products of constructive imagination sometimes very 
grotesque ones. 
Difference between Reproductive and Constructive 
Imagination. —-To learn whether any particular image, 
or combination of images, is the product of reproductive or 
constructive imagination, all we have to do is to learn
-P-A-G-E-269
260 IMAGINATION. 
whether or not it is a copy of a past experience. Our 
memories, of course, are defective, and we may be uncer- 
tain on that account; but, apart from that, we need be in 
no doubt whatever. 
Applying this test, it is evident that when we learn any- 
thing from a book or from a friend we are exercising the 
constructive imagination. Reading is sometimes defined 
as thinking along prescribed lines; and if we carefully 
“examine our own minds, we shall see that all thinking is 
done, for the most part, through images, either of things 
or words. When, then, we read, we form and combine 
images in a certain prescribed way — in the way prescribed 
by the language of the author — provided we understand 
him. When we listen to the conversation of a friend, we 
evidently do the same thing. Unless, therefore, our friend 
or book says precisely what we ourselves have thought, 
and in precisely the same way, it is evident that we grasp 
the thoughts by means of the constructive imagination. 
(When we find out a thing for ourselves, by the exercise 
of our own powers — the only other way in which we can 
learn anything —I think we shall see that is done through 
constructive imagination.} A boy has a problem in arith- 
metic to solve. What is the first thing for him to do? 
Understand it, as we say; and this, we have just seen, he 
can only do through constructive imagination. When he 
clearly grasps the conditions stated in the problem, he 
asks what follows from them. He reasons that such and 
such a result would follow — which result is likewise 
imaged constructively, and so on to the end. Kepler 
wanted to know the shape of the path which the planets 
make in their journeys round the sun. He made guess 
after guess, each time comparing his guess with the facts,
-P-A-G-E-270
CONSTRUCTIVE IMAGINATION. 261 
until finally he was successful. This again was accom- 
plished through the conStructive imagination, was it not? 
Only by means of the constructive imagination could he 
form any sort of an idea of any particular planet, and each 
guess was an imaging of this planet pursuing a course that 
he had never seen it take. A child of one or two or three’ 
years listens daily to conversations between his mamma 
and papa. Sometimes consciously — always consciously 
or unconsciously —— he is trying to understand them. How 
does he succeed in learning the meaning of so many 
words? Precisely, for the most part, as Kepler discovered 
the shape of the planetary orbits — by making a successful 
hypothesis. By the time he is three he knows how to use 
words that apply to purely mental processes—such as know, 
think, believe, understand. We thinks of —forms an image 
of — certain mental facts which he remembers in connec- 
tion with certain words —— brings images into a relation in 
which he has never experienced them, until he gets the right 
pair together —- until he makes a successful hypothesis. 
Sometimes we can catch him in the very act of construc- 
tively ascertaining the meaning of a word. When a child 
of two speaks of the “skin of a book” through an act of 
inductive reasoning, he has concluded that the outside 
of everything is its skin— and this conclusion, to be a 
conclusion at all, must be imaged in part in his mind. 
Evidently, therefore, the constructive imagination is not 
monopolized by poets and painters and novelists. Who- 
ever reads, whoever listens to a conversation intelligently, 
whoever thinks — imagines, and imagines constructively. 
“There are indeed as many different kinds” — or rather 
cases — “of imagination as there are kinds of intellectual _ 
activity.”

LESSON XXVIII 
IMAGINATION. 
(Continued) 
Scope of Constructive Imagination.— In the last lesson 
we saw that the imagination of popular thought differs 
widely from the imagination of which Psychology treats. 
When people in ordinary conversation speak of imagination, 
they mean a kind of constructive imagination — thé kind 
that poets, painters, novelists, and musicians possess in an 
unusually high degree — the power of combining ideas or 
images furnished by reproductive imagination into new 
wholes, without having received suggestions as to the com- 
binations from any one else. But it is now plain that we, 
who understand the poems, paintings, and novels that are 
the product of the constructive imagination, exercise con- 
structive imagination. It does, indeed, require a higher 
power of it to combine images and groups of images origi- 
nally than to do so under guidance, so much higher that 
some writers would give it another name and call it the 
creative imagination. But if we adopt their name we need 
toremember that the creative imagination of a Shakespeare, 
a Beethoven, a Thackeray, a Raphael, does not differ in 
kind from that of the child who imagines himself becoming 
a bird. 
263
-P-A-G-E-273
264 IMAGINATION. 
Differences in Constructive Imagination. — This en- 
ables us to see why great works of art — works which are 
the product of a high power of constructive imagination — 
often wait a long time to get their proper appreciation. 
Talk to a child about the pleasure of study, and he will 
not understand you. His experience has not furnished 
him with the material for comprehending what you say. 
His idea of happiness is the possession of cake and candy 
in abundance, and toys without stint. A little girl, who 
wished to show her affection for her mamma, urged her 
papa to get “a wheelbarrow and a dollie” for her mamma 
when he went to town; and when he came back without 
them she was deeply grieved. She built her notion of 
happiness out of the materials furnished by her own expe- 
rience, and had no idea that it was not valid for every one. 
Some great writers seem to be so superior to even their 
most highly cultivated contemporaries in their power of 
constructive imagination that the latter can not think the 
thoughts of the former even under their direction. Beet- 
hoven’s Grand Symphony was unintelligible to his musical 
contemporaries, and Newton’s Princifia was beyond the 
comprehension of the best mathematicians of his time. 
The intuitions of Beethoven and Newton, their perception 
of musical and mathematical truth, were so much more 
vivid and profound than those of their contemporaries that 
the products of their constructive imagination were unin- 
telligible. 
Constructive Imagination and the Feelings. — Con- 
structive imagination is also very closely related to the 
feelings. We have already noticed two quite sharply con- 
trasted cases in which constructive imagination works —
-P-A-G-E-274
IMAGINATION AND BELIEF. 265 
the case in which its products are controlled by the will, 
and that in which the will exercises no control whatever 
over the play of images. The products of passive imagina- 
tion —as we may call the latter —plainly depend upon 
the feelings. Tell me the character of the images that 
habitually pass through your mind, and I will tell you 
what you like. As you can tell the tastes of a gourmand 
by noticing what he eats, so you can determine a man’s 
likes and dislikes by knowing the images upon which he 
habitually dwells. This explains the very great influence 
of the feelings on belief. Only so far as the facts of the | 
world and of life get aged in our minds do they influence 
belief; and those that we image are, for the most part, 
those that it gives us pleasure to think of — those that it 
gratifies some part of our emotional nature to think of. 
Relation between Imagination and Belief. — It follows 
that the exercise of the imagination may be attended with 
very grave intellectual results. The desire to imagine 
pleasant things may be stronger than the desire to imagine 
things that are true. All men of strong prejudices are 
examples of this. They are so anxious to believe a par- 
ticular thing — find so much pleasure in picturing it in 
their imagination and thinking of it as real that they 
will not fairly consider the arguments that make against 
their favorite theory. That is the reason why strong par- 
tisans only read the newspapers of their own party. They 
do not want to read both sides of the question. They only 
want to see their own. side strongly supported, that they 
may have the pleasure of dwelling upon arguments that ~ 
support the conclusion they have made up their minds to 
believe.
-P-A-G-E-275
266 IMAGINATION, 
But the constructive imagination is often exercised for 
the sake of the feelings. When you build air castles, what 
are you doing? Exercising the constructive imagination 
— bringing before your mind images of what you would 
like to be real. Why do you do it? Because it pleases 
you. That is the reason why most people are so fond of 
reading novels. The events which the novelist enables 
them to picture please them more than the prosaic realities 
of every-day life. Sully has a paragraph on this subject 
that is worthy of careful attention. “The indulgence in 
these pleasures of the imagination,” he says, “is legitimate 
within certain bounds. But it is attended with dangers. 
A youth whose mind dwells long on the wonders of 
romance may grow discontented with his actual surround- 
ings, and so morally unfit for the work and duties of life. 
Or — what comes to much the same — he learns to satisfy 
himself with these imaginative indulgences, and so, by the 
habitual severance of feeling from will, gradually becomes 
incapable of deciding and acting —a result illustrated by 
the history of Coleridge and other dreamers.” I read a 
story of a Russian lady which illustrates this, She went 
to the theatre, and wept freely over the imaginary suffer- 
ings of the hero of the tragedy ; while the knowledge that 
her coachman was shivering in the cold on the outside 
waiting for her did not cause the faintest suggestion of 
pity. Of course, if we read novels not merely for pleasure, 
but for their interpretations of life—for the light they 
throw upon our relations to our fellows—— such a “sev- 
erance of feeling from will” can not follow. It is for 
teachers and parents to see to it that novel-reading serves 
its proper educational purpose — the purpose of broaden- 
ing and strengthening the imagination, and preparing the
-P-A-G-E-276
IMAGINATION AND ACTION. 267 
will for its proper work by giving the feelings that are 
excited by it an active direction. 
Relation between Imagination and Action. — It fol- 
lows from all this that what we will to do often depends 
upon constructive imagination. Men do rash things because 
they do not clearly realize the consequences of their con- 
duct. Help a boy form the habit of clearly and fully 
realizing the probable consequences of his conduct — help 
him form the habit of realizing that the consequences of 
our acts depend not upon our wishes and intentions, but 
upon the nature of our acts— and you have gone a long 
way toward giving him the power and the habit of willing 
intelligently. 
This brief survey of the relation of imagination to our 
mental life enables us to realize what indeed a considera- 
tion of its nature would have enabled us to see beforehand 
—that the part it plays in our mental life is of the very 
highest importance. Not reality, but what gets repre- 
sented in our minds as reality — not what zs, but what is 
imaged — affects our mental life. It is exceedingly inter- 
esting and instructive to note the naive self-importance of 
a child —the belief, appearing in so many forms, that 
the world exists for him. The stern relentlessness of 
nature — the stoic disregard of our desires and wishes with 
which she pushes on to her own ends, trampling us under 
foot if we but cross her path — has not got imaged in his 
mind. And until it does, his attitude toward the world is 
precisely the same as though his thoughts were true. If, 
indeed, it is true — and is it not? — that all good causes 
depend upon the right training of the child, is it not 
evident what tremendous importance attaches to the right
-P-A-G-E-277
268 IMAGINATION. 
training of the faculty that constitutes the audience-chamber 
in which Reality gets its only hearing ? 
Effects of Training the Imagination. — The accurate 
study of any subject is a training of the imagination, and 
yet there is scarcely one that does not tend to dispose the 
mind to be inhospitable to the images that represent cer- 
tain phases of Reality. The specialist in mathematics is 
in danger of forgetting that not all reality is demonstrable ; 
hints and suggestions and probabilities, that fall short of 
demonstration, he is in danger of despising. The specialist 
in literature is in danger of thinking of the attainment of 
truth as altogether too easy a matter. What did Shake- 
speare mean? What he—~the student — finds in him. 
‘And he is in danger of being much too ready to project 
himself after the same fashion into the great Book of 
Nature, and get at the heart of her mysteries in the same 
easy way. The specialist in any branch of natural science 
is in danger of forgetting that there are any facts except 
those that can be weighed and measured, or that anything 
is worthy of belief that can not be proved experimentally 
The specialist in mind is, or rather was (it is scarcely true 
now that so much stress is laid on Physiological Psychol- 
ogy), in danger of undervaluing the methods of natural 
science — the methods that have so completely transformed 
the civilization of this century. 
All this enables us to see that one of our great intellect- 
ual needs is breadth of culture, which is indeed, for the 
most part, but another name for that training which makes 
us disposed and able to give a fair hearing to all sides of 
Reality, and that we are in danger of missing it through 
too early specialization.
-P-A-G-E-278
IMAGINATION AND GEOGRAPHY. 269 
Imagination and Geography. — But while the various 
subjects mentioned above afford scope for the cultivation 
of the imagination, we shall, of course, bear in mind that 
the subjects especially adapted to its training in the public 
schools are history, geography, and reading. We should 
prepare to teach history in part by getting a thorough 
comprehension of the motives of the men who played a 
leading part in history; and we should endeavor to give 
our pupils such insight into their characters as to check 
the tendency to unqualified praise and blame. We should 
also try to give them the power to hold in their minds 
complex groups of facts, that they may see their relations 
to each other. In descriptive geography, we should try to 
leave in their minds definite and clear images of the coun- 
tries they are studying. See the kind of knowledge of 
Tasmania Dr. Arnold wanted: “Will you describe to me 
the general aspect of the country round Hobart Town? 
To this day I never could meet with a description of the 
common face of the country about New York or Boston or 
Philadelphia, and therefore I have no distinct ideas of it. 
Is your country plain or undulating, your valleys deep or 
shallow, curving, or with steep sides and flat bottoms? 
Are your fields large or small, parted by hedges or stone 
walls, with single trees about them, or patches of wood 
here and there? Are there many scattered houses, and 
what are they built of — brick, wood, or stone? And what 
are the hills and streams like—ridges or with waving 
summits, with plain sides or indented with combs, full of 
springs or dry, and what is their geology?” Such a knowl- 
edge of the look of a country we want to get and give our 
pupils, and such knowledge can not fail to increase the 
power to form vivid images of things.
-P-A-G-E-279
270 | IMAGINATION, 
‘Imagination and Reading. — One of Mr. Galton’s 
* incidents will enable us, to see the difference between the 
proper and the improper use of the imagination in-reading. 
“T want to tell you about a boat,” he said to a company 
one day, and, before proceeding further, he asked them to 
tell him what his words suggested. “One person, a young 
lady, said that she immediately saw the image of a rather 
large boat pushing off from the shore, and that it was full 
of ladies and gentlemen, the ladies being dressed in blue 
and white.” It is unnecessary to say that that kind of 
imagination interferes with abstract thought. “ Another 
person, who was accustomed to philosophize, said that the 
word ‘boat’ had aroused no definite image because he 
had purposely held his mind in suspense.’ But if Mr. 
Galton had gone on: “The boat was a four-oared racing- 
boat, it was passing quickly to the left just in front of me, 
‘and the men were bending forward to take a fresh stroke,” 
then his hearers should have formed a picture; and the more 
vivid, detailed, and exact the picture, the more completely 
the imagination would have subserved its proper function. 
In the teaching of reading, then, discourage your pupils 
from forming definite images corresponding to general 
terms, but encourage them to form exact and detailed 
images corresponding to particular terms. 
Child Study and Imagination. — But there are other 
suggestions that I think we should get from this study of 
imagination. We have seen how universally active the 
constructive imagination is, and yet that it depends for its 
materials upon the reproductive imagination. We see, 
therefore, from anew point of view the necessity of making 
a careful study of our pupils, You would not hire a man
-P-A-G-E-280
QUESTIONS. 271 ee 
to build a house without furnishing the necessary materials. Le 
Be equally reasonable with your pupils, and do not expect 
them to build images out of nothing. Many a little boy or 
girl has an utterly erroneous idea of an ocean, because the 
teacher has not taken pains to dwell’ on the experiences 
the images of which would have made the required activity 
of the constructive imagination possible. 
But with all the pains you may take, if you want to be 
sure that your pupils have performed the necessary acts of 
constructive imagination, there is but one way -— by ques- 
tioning. We are constantly talking to our pupils about 
matters that, by long reading and reflection, have become 
familiar to us. First comprehended with difficulty, they 
have become so simple that we forget how they looked 
when our minds got their first glimpse of them. We can 
hardly realize that what is so simple to us should be diffi- 
cult to any one, and we never shall realize it save by ever- 
lasting questioning.

LESSON XXIX. 
CONCEPTION. 
What the Mind Does in Conception. — The word 
“dog” evidently does not mean the same as “this dog.” 
“This dog” may be a long-haired, long-nosed, long-eared 
black dog, with white spots on his back; while “dog” is 
the name not only of this dog, but of all dogs whatever. 
The same is true, of course, of all general names. All 
general names are names of classes—names that are 
applicable to every individual of the class — while particu- 
lar names, such as proper nouns and common nouns, lim- 
ited by words like “this” and “that,” are names that can 
be applied in the same sense to but one individual. How 
did the mind get this power—-this power to use class- 
names intelligently ? We never see a class ;* we only see 
individuals. Classes do not.make themselves known to 
us through any of the senses. How, then, does the mind 
form an idea of a class? To answer that question is to 
state what the mind does in conception, for conception zs 
that act of the mind by which it forms an idea of a class, 
or that act of the mind that enables us to use general 
names intelligently. 
1 It is, of course, understood that I am using the word “class” to denote 
an indefinite number of individuals that resemble each other in certain 
particulars, 
273
-P-A-G-E-283
274 CONCEPTION, 
First Step towards a Knowledge of Things. — We 
have seen that our mental life begins with unclassified, 
’ unknown, indefinite, undifferenced sensations~—that the 
first step towards a knowledge of things consists in the 
transformation of what we can only describe as vague 
feeling into definite sensations of this and that character. 
I say the first seg. We must be careful to note that this 
transformation is not finished; a child does not become 
conscious of definite sensations of sound and taste before 
it begins to take the second step—before it begins to 
localize its sensations. We must think of this transforma- 
tion not as an instantaneous process, but as a gradual 
change. A change in the direction of decreasing indefi- 
niteness in sensations is undoubtedly the first change in 
the direction of knowledge of things, or, indeed, of any 
knowledge whatever. But before any sensation has the 
definite character our sensations now have when we attend 
to them, the child begins to take the second step — it 
begins to localize its sensations. 
Second and Third Steps. — But here again we must 
note that this feeling of place may have very different 
degrees of definiteness. Even in our mature experiences 
we are sometimes conscious of sensations of pain without 
being able to locate them precisely, as when we have the 
toothache and do not know exactly which tooth aches. 
This process of localization, then, is at first a vague feeling of 
whereness; and before this vague feeling becomes a knowl- 
edge of a definite place — before the second step towards 
a knowledge of things has been fully taken—the third 
begins; the child’s sensations are beginning to be grouped 
together and regarded as qualities of external objects.
-P-A-G-E-284
KNOWLEDGE OF INDIVIDUALS. 275 
In What does the Knowledge of Individuals Con- 
sist? —Let us suppose the three steps taken; let us 
suppose that a child has come to know a long-haired, long- ~ 
nosed, long-eared black dog, with white spots on his back, 
to such an extent that, when asked where the dog is, he 
looks at him, and says “dog’’ when he sees him, as soon 
as he begins to talk. In what does this knowledge con- 
sist? In the fact that he has associated certain sensations 
of color with certain sensations of touch — those which he 
has received from running his hand over the dog —and 
both these with the name “dog.” This is how it happens 
that when he sees or feels the dog he thinks of the name, ~ 
and that when he hears the name he thinks of the dog. 
The sensations of color and touch, and the name “ dog,” 
have become so tied together by association by contiguity 
that one always brings the other to his mind. : 
But now we need to remember that the pair so tied 
together is, strictly speaking, not one pair at all, but an 
indefinite number of pairs more or less closely resembling 
each other. No matter who says “dog,” whether papa, or 
mamma, or brother, or sister, or nurse, whether the word 
is pronounced in a high or low tone of voice, whether the 
speaker is one foot or ten feet away, the child thinks of 
“dog.” But the sensation of sound in each of these 
cases is different. No matter where he sees the dog, 
whether in-doors or out; no matter what the dog is 
doing, whether eating or drinking, walking, running, 
standing, or lying down, the child recognizes him — 
thinks of his name. But the sensation of color in each 
of these cases is different. This looks like general 
knowledge to begin with. We are trying to learn how 
the mind forms general ideas —how it gains the power
-P-A-G-E-285
276 . CONCEPTION. 
to use general names intelligently. It looks as though it 
exercises this power even in knowing individual objects. 
The spoken word “dog” is itself the name of a large class 
of sounds; for, as we have seen, it is not only a different 
sound in the mouth of every different speaker, but in no 
two cases do they exactly resemble each other. The sen- 
sations of color, also, received from the dog are not the 
same sensations, but an indefinitely large class of more or 
less closely resembling sensations. The child, then, in 
recognizing the word “dog” whenever he hears it, and the 
sensations of’ color received from the dog whenever he 
sees him, seems to perform a mental act very much like 
recognizing any dog whenever he sees him; but that 
implies a knowledge of the class “dog” ——implies, in a 
word, the exercise of the very power of conception we are 
trying to explain. 
What does the Child Know First ? — But are we not 
mistaken? Students of mind, from Aristotle down, have 
noticed that when a child begins to talk it calls all men 
“papa” indiscriminately. What is the explanation of this? 
It must be ezther that the child perceives the resemblance 
between other men and his papa, and applies the same 
name to them because of their resemblance — knowing, 
nevertheless, that they are different individuals — or that 
he confuses every man with his papa, because he sees no 
difference between them. If we accept the latter, we must 
say with Sir William Hamilton, that “in the mouths of 
children language at first expresses neither the precisely 
general nor the determinately individual, but the vague 
and confused,” and that this vague and confused idea, 
modified in one direction, becomes the definite knowledge
-P-A-G-E-286
REASONS. : 277 
of an individual ; modified in another, the definite knowl- 
edge of aclass. ‘ Papa,” for example, would not mean to 
a child his own father, neither would it be the name of a 
class perceived to consist of different individuals, but the 
name applied to resembling individuals not known to be 
different. 
In discussing this question, we must try to get at the 
heart of the matter; we must try to separate what is 
merely accidental and incidental from what is essential. 
What is the essential fact maintained? It is that the first 
knowledge which children have of the persons and things 
about them is not of persons and known things to be defi- 
nite individuals, but of persons and things confused with 
each other, because of their resemblances. This may be 
true, and the contention of Aristotle and of many studgnts 
of mind since his time— that children call all men “papa,” 
for example, indiscriminately — may be false. Children 
begin to talk at quite different stages of their development. 
If the theory is true, we may expect, therefore, to see evi- 
dences of this confusion in the language of some children 
when they begin to talk, and not in that of others. 
Reasons.—I believe that the first knowledge of children 
is of this character: (1) because the mind perceives resem- 
blances more easily than differences. 1 know two brothers 
whom at first I could scarcely tell apart; now, I see that 
they are so unlike that it is hard to realize that I should 
ever have confused them. What isthe explanation? At 
first I saw resemblances only; not until I had seen them 
often did I note the differences between them, Children’s 
minds evidently work the same way. Ducks, geese, swans 
are all ducks to them. And we may expect them to show
-P-A-G-E-287
278 CONCEPTION, 
as much less power in perceiving differences than we 
possess as their minds are less developed than ours. 
(2) There ave cases in which children unquestionably con- 
fuse different individuals, one of whom they know well, 
because of their resemblances. Perez teils the following 
story of a child of thirteen months: “As one of his cousins 
was like his uncle, having the same sort of beard, and the 
same kind of figure and voice, the child treated him at 
once as an old acquaintance. He called him Toto (the 
name he had given to his uncle). . . . Seeing a pencil in 
his cousin’s hand, he took it from him, put it in his mouth, 
and made with his lips the movements and sounds of a 
man who is smoking and puffing his smoke in the air. 
His uncle used to smoke. When he got down from the 
table he said, ‘lou, lou, lou, lou,’ in a tone of entreaty. 
This was explained to the cousin as signifying that he was 
to imitate the dog as his uncle was in the habit of doing 
to the child’s great delight. Out in the garden the child 
made another request, which his cousin did not under- 
stand, much to the astonishment of the former, who was 
accustomed to being instantly obeyed: by his uncle... . 
His cousin, having been coached up in his part, humored, 
as far as possible, all the habits which his uncle had made 
necessary to the child; but some he replaced by ways of 
his own; and the end of it was, that after being with his 
cousin three weeks the child afterwards expected from his 
uncle all the gestures, tones of voice, games, indulgences, 
and acts of obedience which the new Zo/o had accustomed 
him to.” 
‘What Makes the Perception of Individuals Possible? 
— Such facts seem to show that the first knowledge of
-P-A-G-E-288
QUESTIONS. 279 
children is neither of individuals nor of classes. Not of 
individuals, because the child has only noted resemblances. 
between things, or between the same thing seen at dif- 
ferent times. But the perception of individuals is impos- 
sible without the perception of differences. Two men with 
exactly similar beard, same complexion, of the same size 
—exactly similar in every respect, and occupying the 
same position —- would not be two men, but one. Two 
men also who seemed to be exactly alike in every respect 
would be regarded as the same person, however unlike 
they might be. Also, the first knowledge of children is 
not of classes, because, until they know individuals, they 
can not know classes, szzce a class means and is nothing 
but @ collection of individuals resembling each other in 
certain particulars. But their first ideas of things are 
vague, confused ideas of resemblances between things not 
known to be different. To avoid circumlocution, we will 
call this idea a class-image.

LESSON XXX. 
CONCEPTION. 
(Continued, 
Steps towards the Knowledge of Concepts. — Since 
a knowledge of class-images antecedes a knowledge of 
individuals, to explain conception we have first to explain 
how the knowledge of class-images externalized as things 
becomes a knowledge of definite individuals. Evidently 
the various steps or stages that mark the progress of the 
mind from those undifferentiated, indefinite sensations 
with which our mental life began to the formation of con- 
cepts are (1) the knowledge of class-images externalized 
as things; (2) the knowledge of individuals; and (3) the 
formation of concepts. 
How a Knowledge of Class-Images Becomes a Knowl- 
edge of Individuals.— To see how the knowledge of 
class-images externalized as things becomes the knowledge 
of individuals, we must study our own experiences. Why 
did I confuse the two brothers mentioned in the last 
lesson? Because I saw no differences between them. 
It seems hard to realize that a child can see no difference 
between a large man with a full beard and a small one with 
none. But our powers of perceiving both resemblances 
and differences are much greater than a child’s; and if I 
281
-P-A-G-E-291
282 CONCEPTION, 
could confuse two people whom I now see to be very 
unlike, we shall be able to realize that a child may see 
‘two very different things without being able to observe 
any difference between them. How did I finally gain the 
power to tell them apart? By withdrawing my attention 
from them as wholes and fixing it upon individual 
features — size, color of eyes, and the like. In precisely 
similar ways the child gains the power to distinguish 
individuals. And here we can see why it is so hard for 
him to acquire it. It is easy for you to withdraw your 
attention from objects as wholes and fix it upon parts or . 
qualities, but it is very hard for a child. The individual 
features are there, but he does not see them because he 
does not attend to them. But little by little he gains the 
power to fix his attention upon individual features, and as 
he acquires it he gains a knowledge of individuals. 
What Differences are First Noted ? —When a chiid 
distinguishes individuals because he notes some of the 
differences between them, it is easy to see that he will 
first note only the most striking differences. The first 
difference that he notes between a big black dog and a 
small white one is probably a difference in color. The 
‘ class-image of dog has become, on the one hand, the per- 
ception of individual dogs. Seeing no difference between 
them except in color, and noticing that they are both 
called dogs, he drops out of his class-image of dog the 
element of color, and associates what is left with the name 
“dog” whenever he hears it. What is left of the class- 
image when the element of color is dropped out of tt ts a 
rudimentary concept, and the act of mind by which it is 
reached is conception. 
el
-P-A-G-E-292
STEPS IN FORMING A CONCEPT. 283 
  
Steps in Forming a Concept. — Let us observe closely 
the steps that led from the percept of the individual to the 
concept of the class. The first step taken by the child 
towards the formation of the concept consisted in fixing 
his attention upon both dogs, or upon one dog and an 
image of the other at the same time, Letus call this first 
step comparison. The second consisted in withdrawing 
his attention from the point of unlikeness —color —and 
fixing it upon their points of likeness. Precisely as an 
essential step towards a knowledge of individuals consists 
in withdrawing the attention from the objects as wholes 
and fixing it upon individual parts or features, so an essen- 
tial step towards a formation of concepts consists in with- 
drawing the attention from the points in which the objects 
compared are seen to be unlike, and fixing it upon those 
in which they are seen to be like. Let us call this step 
abstraction. The third step consisted in applying the 
name “dog” to all other objects having the same charac- 
teristics —in making the name general by making it the 
name of a class. Let us call this generalization. These 
three acts of the mind, then — comparison, or the fixing of 
the attention upon two or more objects at the same time; 
abstraction, or withdrawing it from some of their unlike- 
nesses and putting it upon some of their likenesses; gen- 
eralization, or the making of a name general by making it 
the name of all the individuals possessing similar qualities 
—are the three acts that constitute conception. 
Concepts Liable to Change. — We see at once that the 
concept — the product of conception — is liable to constant 
change. The only difference that the child first observes 
between the two dogs is a difference in color, As he
-P-A-G-E-293
284 CONCEPTION. 
observes asi more and more carefully he notices more 
and mor: ‘ shall\1ces — the word “dog” means a smaller 
and sma tifferam ber of attributes. And when he hears 
the nam ~pplied to other animals he naturally puts them 
in the sa. e class, and the meaning of “dog” is correspond- 
ingly red’'ced, although each separate act of abstraction 
is follow 1 by an act of generalization—— the extending 
of the name so reduced in meaning to all objects having 
the common characteristics he has observed. 
But while a more careful and a wider observation of 
dogs in this way reduces the concept, it may enlarge it in 
another way. The child may notice points of resemblance 
before unobserved. In this way his concept is made to 
include more attributes — the class-name comes to have a 
richer meaning. 
Definition of Concept.— From the point of view we 
have now reached we can see with some definiteness what 
a concept is. It was said above that a concept is the 
product of conception, and that conception is that act of 
the mind which enables us to use general names intel- 
ligently. This amounts to saying that we have a concept 
of a class when we can use the class-name intelligently, 
but as to what a concept is — we are left entirely in the 
dark. 
If we carefully look into our minds when we hear or use 
a general term which we understand, I think we shall find 
either no mental picture whatever corresponding to tt, or 
else a menial picture with the feeling that a great many 
other mental pictures would serve the purpose just as well. 
When any one speaks of “dogs,” for example, in my hear- 
ing, I shall probably not form a mental picture of any dog
-P-A-G-E-294
VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY CONCEPTS. 285 
whatever. As I hear the word, a feeling of ;, -ailiarity 
arises in my mind, a feeling that I know what, ic ,meant, 
and this feeling, attaching itsely to the word, cy stitutes 
my entire conceptual consciousness, so far as the .,case is 
concerned. But if I do form a picture of some y,;fticular 
dog, I do it with the feeling that the picture of apy other 
dog would do as well. In that event, this picture, .yith the 
accompanying feeling constitutes my entire conceptual 
consciousness. 1 
Voluntary and Involuntary Concepts. — The attention 
that results in comparison and abstraction may be either 
voluntary or involuntary, and therefore concepts may be 
formed voluntarily or involuntarily. We know from our 
study of attention that the concepts that a child forms in 
the first years of his life will, for the most part, be formed 
involuntarily because he is not able to give much voluntary 
attention. 
How to Make Inaccurate Concepts Accurate. — Of 
course, concepts formed in this by-rule-of-thumb manner 
are indistinct and inaccurate. They are sure to contain 
attributes that careful observation would exclude, and not 
to include others that such observation would bring to 
light. But we must remember that it is exactly this kind 
of concepts that constitutes the furniture of a child’s mind 
when he first starts to school. To transform these indistinct 
and inaccurate concepts into those that are distinct and 
accurate—to enlarge the number of concepts — is evi- 
dently an important part of education. 
We shall be able to do this more intelligently if we 
remember not only the manner in which they are formed,
-P-A-G-E-295
286 CONCEPTION. 
but the condition upon which their formation depends. 
That condition is rhe perception of resemblances between 
different individuals. Until resemblances are perceived, 
no concept of the resembling objects can be formed. That 
is why a child finds it so hard to understand the meaning 
of numbers. Four horses, four cats, four toys, etc., re- 
semble each other in being four, but they seem to the 
young child to have nothing in common — and therefore 
he does not know what you mean when you call them all 
fours. Not till his mind is able to detach the fact common 
to them all will he be able to understand you. 
One of my students recently told me of a pupil to whom 
he could not teach numbers. The child was eight years 
old, and after persistent efforts to learn the significance of 
numbers would say, when asked how many cows there 
were in the field, seven or nine, for example, when she 
should have said three. 
The difficulty in such cases is that the child has not 
formed the concept of numbers, the child has not seen 
that three dogs resemble three blackboards in one par 
ticular in the particular of being three. 
Until this resemblance is clearly seen, the attempt to 
teach the zames of numbers must be utterly unavailing.

LESSON XXXL. 
CONCEPTION. 
(Continued) 
WE saw in the last lesson that involuntary concepts are 
almost certain to be indistinct and inaccurate, and that 
when children first start to school, unless they have been 
carefully instructed at home, nearly all their concepts are 
of this kind. They have observed the objects they see 
about them closely enough to learn their names, and talk 
about them with a certain degree of intelligence. Because 
they can apply their names correctly, teachers are in great 
danger of thinking that the corresponding concepts are all 
that they need to be. But that is a mistake. 
Words do not Convey Thoughts. — “While an external 
object may be viewed by thousands in common,” said 
Professor S. S. Green, “the idea or image of it addresses 
itself only to the individual consciousness. My idea or 
image of it is mine alone — the reward of careless observa- 
tion, if imperfect; of attentive, careful, and varied obser- 
vation, if correct. Between mine and yours a great gulf 
is fixed. No man can pass from mine to yours, or from 
yours to mine. Neither in any proper sense of the term 
can mine be conveyed to you. Words do not convey 
thoughts ; they are not the vehicles of thoughts in any 
288
-P-A-G-E-298
WHAT LANGUAGE DOES. 289 
true sense of that term. A word is simply a com- 
mon symbol which each associates with his own idea 
or image. 
What Language Does. —‘“ Neither can I compare mine 
with yours except through the mediation of external ob- 
jects. And then how now do I know that they are alike; 
that a measure called a foot, for instance, seems as long to 
you as tome? My idea of a new object which you and I 
observe together may be very imperfect. By it I may 
attribute to the object what does not belong to it, take 
from it what does, distort its form, or otherwise pervert it. 
Suppose, now, at the time of observation we agree upon a 
| word as a sign or symbol for the object or the idea of it. | 
The object is withdrawn ;.the idea only remains — imper- 
fect, in my case; complete and vivid in yours. The sign 
is employed. Does it bring back the original object? By 
no means. Does it convey my idea to your mind? Nothing 
of the kind; you would be disgusted with the shapeless 
image. Does it convey yours to me? No; I should be 
delighted at the sight. What does it effect? J¢ becomes 
the occasion for each to call up his own image. Does 
each now contemplate the same thing? What multitudes 
of dissimilar images instantly spring up at the announce- 
ment of the same symbol!—dissimilar not because of 
anything in the ove source whence they are derived, but 
because of either an inattentive and imperfect observation 
of that source, or of some constitutional or habitual defect 
in the use of the perceptive faculty.” : 
How Inaccurate Concepts can be Made Accurate. — 
What, then, can we do to make these involuntary, and
-P-A-G-E-299
290 CONCEPTION. 
therefore indistinct and inaccurate, concepts distinct 
and accurate? When a child starts to school, he attaches 
a meaning to near, far, narrow, and many similar words, 
but his concept of them is based entirely on his own 
observations, and is therefore very inaccurate. He has 
heard his parents talk about narrow ribbons, narrow boards, 
and the like, and if his teacher, without further illustration, 
tells him that an isthmus is a narrow neck of land, he will 
be sure to misunderstand her. Shall we seek to make his 
concepts accurate by definitions? No; for he can not 
understand our definitions unless he has accurate concepts 
corresponding to the words we use. We must get him to 
follow the path that leads to accurate concepts; we must 
get him to compare a large enough variety of near and 
narrow objects to enable him to apprehend the one com- 
mon quality that such objects possess — we must get him 
to compare, abstract, and generalize. 
Select Particulars Showing the Extreme Varieties. — 
But while it is necessary for us to bring the mind of our 
pupil into contact with particulars in order to make his 
concepts accurate, the very necessity of doing it shows the 
need of exercising care as to the kind of particulars you 
select. Why is a child’s concept of zarvow inaccurate? 
Because he has considered only certain kinds of narrow 
things — narrow ribbons, narrow paths, narrow planks, and 
the like. A young man told me that until he was eight 
years old he thought all rivers were like the one near his 
home. We see, therefore, the necessity of selecting par- 
ticulars that show all the extreme varieties.’ 
41 See Bain’s Education as a Science, p. 92
-P-A-G-E-300
PROMINENCE TO THE MAIN IDEA, 291 
. Those that Give Prominence to the Main Idea. — 
Begin also with particulars that give prominence to the 
main idea. If you are teaching your pupils what an island 
is, call their attention first to an island far from the main- 
land, in order that the characteristic quality of an island 
may be brought out prominently. 
Select your particulars also solely with reference to the 
end in view. Do not select such as have an interest in 
themselves, because they attract the attention to features 
that are not included in the concept — features, therefore, 
that you wish the child to ignore. , : 
Finally, stick to your purpose until it is accomplished. 
Accumulate particular after particular until the desired 
concept is formed, allowing yourself to be tempted into 
no digression whatever. Of course we should pursue the 
same method in developing new concepts. 
Two Purposes Served by Language. — But in most 
cases our pupils have no names for the new concepts we 
help them to form until we give them. When should we 
give them? Evidently not until they need them. Lan- 
guage serves two purposes. In the first place, it enables 
us to preserve the results of our own thinking. When we 
have performed these processes of comparison, abstraction, 
and generalization — when we have formed a concept — if 
we did not give it a name, there would be nothing to fix 
it in our minds. When we associate a name with the con- 
cept, the name enables us to recall it without repeating 
the processes of comparison, abstraction, and generaliza- 
tion that in the first place enabled us to form it. But we 
have no use for general names to assist us in fixing con- 
cepts in our minds until we have formed the concepts of
-P-A-G-E-301
292 | CONCEPTION. 
which they are names. When we consider the other use 
of language, we are led to the same conclusion. The other 
use of language, of course, is to communicate ideas. As 
we have already seen, no such thing, strictly speaking, is 
possible. What you do when you are said to communicate 
ideas is to occasion your hearer or reader to recall ideas 
and make combinations of ideas similar to those in your 
own mind. This you are able to do by using a sign or 
. symbol with which he has associated the same idea you 
have in your mind. Evidently, then, language can not be 
used to communicate ideas, or rather to occasion the re- 
calling of ideas, until you have yourself associated a sign 
or symbol with the idea you wish recalled, and until your 
hearer has formed the same association. 
Hence the absurdity of teaching words without ideas. 
Words are like paper money; their value depends on what 
they stand for. As you would be none the richer for pos- 
sessing Confederate money to the amount of a million of 
dollars, so your pupils would be none the wiser for being 
able to repeat book after book by heart unless the words 
were the signs of ideas in their minds. Words without 
ideas are an irredeemable paper currency. 
‘The Blind Use of Words the Fundamental Error. — 
It is the practical recognition of this truth that has revolu- 
tionized the best schools of the country in the last quarter 
of acentury. Pestalozzi well called the blind use of words 
in matters of instruction the “fundamental error.” He 
was not the first educational reformer who insisted on 
it. Montaigne, Comenius, Locke, Rousseau, had all in- 
sisted on the same idea, but they were in advance of their 
time; the world was not ready to listen tothem. But in

PESTALOZZI’S REFORM. 293° 
1806, after Prussia was thoroughly beaten by Napoleon at 
the battle of Jena; when her capital city was in the hands 
of her conqueror, and she lay humiliated at his feet, it 
occurred to some of her leading men that the regeneration 
of the nation was to be sought in education. In this 
way it happened that the ideas of Pestalozzi were em- 
bodied in the schools of Germany, whence they have 
gone into the schools of every civilized country in the 
world. : 
Pestalozzi’s Reform. -— In what did the reform inau- 
gurated by Pestalozzi consist? Jn the substitution of the 
intelligent for the blind use of words. He reversed the 
educational engine.? Before his time, teachers expected 
their pupils to go from words to ideas; he taught them to ~ 
go from ideas to words. He brought out the fact upon, 
which I have been insisting — that words are utterly 
powerless to create ideas; that all they can do is to help 
the pupil to recall and combine ideas already formed. 
With Pestalozzi, therefore, and with those who have been 
imbued with his theories, the important matter is ¢he form- 
ing of clear and definite ideas. 
1It is tome a very interesting fact that Pestalozzi went to Paris early 
in this century in order to try to induce Napoleon to reform the educa- 
tional system of France in accordance with his ideas, Napoleon said he 
had no time to bother his head with questions of ABC. Prussia took 
the time, and the result was that when Prussia and France met again on 
the field of battle nearly seventy years later, the soldiers of Prussia, 
educated in accordance with Pestalozzi’s ideas, completely routed the armies 
of France. 
2 When I wrote this sentence I did not know that Pestalozzi had used 
a similar illustration: “The public common-school coach ... must not 
simply be better horsed, . . . it must be turned round and brought on an 
entirely new road,”
-P-A-G-E-303
294 CONCEPTION. 
Object Lessons. — But how can such ideas be formed f 
By comparison, abstraction, and generalization, and by 
.combining concepts so formed into complex concepts. 
That is why Pestalozzian teachers have made so much use 
of object lessons. Realizing that the only way the mind 
can form ideas of objects is by comparing them, then ab- 
stracting some quality, then generalizing, they have given 
systematic courses of Object Lessons in order that they 
might develop clear and definite concepts of objects in the 
minds of their pupils. . 
But systematic object teaching is not the only, or indeed 
the chief, way of teaching in harmony with this law of the 
mind. Object teaching — bringing the mind of the pupil 
into direct contact with the object out-of-doors, if possible, 
if not, in-doors — will be the method chiefly employed by 
intelligent primary teachers, because the great intellectual 
need of young children is clear and definite concepts of 
objects. Since all our concepts are either simple or com- 
plex, and since, of course, simple concepts must precede 
complex concepts, evidently the first step in education 
should consist in furnishing the mind with a stock of 
simple concepts. And sirice the mind of a child is for the 
most part employed with objects, since his interests lead 
him to direct his attention to the external world, plainly 
the thing to be done is to give him simple concepts of 
objects. But whatever the subject of thought, in order to 
get its simple concepts the mind must take the same path, 
pursue the same course, compare, abstract, generalize.

accessible, or facts that can not be correctly described as 
objects, such as the facts of history, mental facts, mathe- 
matical facts, the intelligent teacher will lead his pupils to 
begin with an examination and comparison of them, then 
go on to note their resemblances and differences, then to 
make generalizations, unless he is sure that they have a 
stock of perfectly definite, simple concepts, by the com- 
bination of which they can form the complex concepts.he 
desires. Such a method of teaching has well been called 
the Objective Method or Objective Teaching, since it 
is an application of the method of teaching by Object 
Lessons to every department of instruction.

(Continued. 
What the Objective Method Is. The great importance 
of the Objective Method of teaching inclines me to think 
that it will be well for us to spend a little more time in 
making an effort to get a thorough comprehension of it — 
such a comprehension as will enable us to use it from day 
to day. To this end, I venture to quote further from 
Professor S, S. Green. “The Objective Method,” he says, 
“is that which takes into account the whole realm of 
Nature and Art so far as the child has examined it, 
assumes as known only what the child knows — not 
what the teacher knows -—— and works from the well known 
to the obscurely known, and so onward and upward until 
the learner can enter the fields of science or abstract 
thought. It is that which develops the abstract from the 
concrete — which develops the zdea, then gives the term. 
It is that which appeals to the intelligence of the child, 
and that through the senses until clear and vivid concepts 
are formed, and then uses these concepts as something 
veal and vital, It is that which follows Nature’s order — 
the thing, the concept, the word ; so that when this order 
is reversed —the word, the concept, the thing — the 
chain of connection shall not be broken. The word shall 
instantly occasion the concept, and the concept shall be 
296

THE OBJECTIVE METHOD ILLUSTRATED. 297 
accompanied with the firm conviction of a corresponding 
external reality. It is that which insists upon something 
besides mere empty verbal expressions in every school 
exercise — in other words, expression and thought in place 
of expression and no thought. 
“Tt is that which makes the school a place where the 
child comes in contact with rea/ities just such as appeal 
to his common sense, as when he roamed at pleasure in 
the fields, and not a place for irksome idleness. It is that 
which relieves a child’s task only by making it intelligible 
and possible, not by taking the burden from him. It bids” 
him examine for himself, discriminate for himself, and 
express for himself — the teacher, the while, standing by 
to give hints and suggestions, not to relieve the labor... In 
short, it is that which addresses itself directly to the eye 
external or internal, which summons to its aid things 
present or things absent, things past or things to come, 
and bids them yield the lessons which they infold — which 
deals with actual existence and not with empty dreams — 
a living realism and not a fossil dogmatism. 
The Objective Method Illustrated. — “It will aid any 
teacher in correcting dogmatic tendencies by enlivening 
his lessons and giving zest to his instructions. He will 
draw from the heavens above and from the earth beneath, 
or from the waters under the earth, from the world with- 
out and the world within. He will not measure his lessons 
by pages, nor progress by fluency of utterance. He will 
dwell in living thought, surrounded by living thinkers, 
leaving at every point the impress of an objective and a 
subjective reality. To him, an exercise in. geography will 
not be a stupid verbatim recitation of descriptive para-

graphs, but a stretching out of the mental! vision to see in 
living picture, ocean and continent, mountain and valley, 
river and lake, not on a level plain, but rounded up to con- 
form to the curvature of a vast globe. The description of 
a prairie on fire, by the aid of the imagination, will be 
wrought up into a brilliant object lesson. A reading-lesson 
descriptive of a thunder-storm on Mt. Washington will be 
something more than a mere conformity to the rules of 
the elocutionist. It will be accompanied by a concept 
wrought into the child’s mind, outstripped in grandeur 
only by the scene itself. The mind’s eye will see the old 
mountain itself with its surroundings of gorge and cliff, of 
wood-land and barren rock, of deep ravine and craggy 
peak. It will see the majestic thunder-cloud moving up, 
with its snow-white summits resting on wall as black as 
midnight darkness. The ear will almost hear the peals of 
muttering thunder as they reverberate from hill to hill.” 
This long extract is worth all the study we can find 
time to put into it. The thorough comprehension and the 
practical appreciation of it will revolutionize our methods 
of teaching as completely as have been the methods of 
teaching in the best schools of the country in the last 
twenty-five years. But there are two or three sentences 
in it that are especially worthy of attention. Professor 
Green says that the Objective Method appeals to the intel- 
ligence of the child through the senses until clear and 
vivid concepts are formed, and then uses these concepts 
as something veal and vital. What does he mean ? 
Real and Vital Concepts. —I said in the last lesson 
that whatever the nature of the facts studied, whether 
objects that can be brought into the recitation room, such

REAL AND VITAL CONCEPTS)"    
as coal, glass, water, and the like, or thst gt are phys- 
ically inaccessible, such as are studiéd-in Tedlde list an) ) 
astronomy, or facts which can not be ‘gorsectly described 
as objects, such as mental facts, historigaf facts, and the : 
like, the Objective Method of teaching 164% the pupil t0 
begin with an examination of the facts ; instead of begith 
ning with inferences about the facts, it puts the pupil fice 
to face with the facts, and leads him to make his own in- 
ferences. How is that possible when we are not dealing 
with objects in the immediate presence of the pupil ? 
When we are dealing with facts or objects that our 
pupils can not observe for themselves, we must develop in 
their minds, as nearly as we can, the same vivid ideas that 
would result from a careful observation of the reality. 
That is what Professor Green means in the sentence to 
which I have called your attention. A concept so vivid as 
to be something real and vital, is a concept that can be 
_ used in forming complex concepts of things only a little 
less vivid than would result from a first-hand observation 
of the reality. He means the same thing when he says 
that the Objective Method takes into account the whole 
realm of Nature and Art so far as the child has examined. 
it; assumes as known only what the child knows — not | 
what the teacher knows. For so long as the teacher keeps 
within the range of the child’s knowledge, the teacher 
presents simple concepts that the child can combine into 
complex concepts, which enable him clearly and vividly to 
realize facts and realities which are beyond the range of 
his observation, but which he can use in comparing, ab- 
Stracting, and generalizing, as though he had seen them 
for himself. . 
When Professor Green says that the Objective Method

addresse: itself to the eye, external or znternal, he means 
\ \to: ‘call! tion to the fact that there are realities which 
can not be cognized by the senses, such as mental facts, 
oo but which, nevertheless, are to be studied in the same 
Ly yay ~ 
First the Reality and then the Play of the Mind 
about the Reality. — This lesson enables us to see that 
one of the favorite doctrines of current pedagogy — first 
the idea, then the word —is inaccurate. In primary in- 
struction it does indeed state with great accuracy the 
proper method of proceeding for the most part. But even 
here the teacher must sometimes violate it. No primary 
teacher can always confine himself to objects that have 
sometimes been within the range of the pupil’s observa- 
tion. He must sometimes take concepts formed from 
actual observation and build out of them concepts of real- 
ities that the pupil has never seen, A more accurate 
. statement is, first the reality-—the thing you wish your 
pupil to study —then the play of the mind about the 
reality. I use the somewhat indefinite phrase, “ play of the 
mind,” because a more definite expression would not be 
sufficiently comprehensive. In some cases, what you want 
from your pupils is not primarily intellectual action, or 
action of the knowing side of the mind at all. You wish 
to bring their minds face to face with a certain reality 
in order to excite the appropriate feelings. That, for 
instance, would be your object in teaching such a reading- 
lesson as the one described by Professor Green. The 
same is true, for the most part, in all teaching of litera- 
ture. You wish to get the thoughts and sentiments of 
the piece in the minds of your pupils in order that they
-P-A-G-E-310
REALITY AND PLAY OF MIND ON REALITY. 301 
may have the proper feelings — appreciation, admiration, 
and the like. In such cases in the maxim: First the 
reality, and then the play of the mind about the reality — 
“the play of the mind” means, for the most part, a certain 
activity of the emotional side of the mind. 
But even when the play of the mind you seek to occa- 
sion is a certain activity of the intellect, the kinds of intel- 
lectual activity that the Objective Method aims at are so 
different in different circumstances that any very definite 
term will not accurately describe them. The play of the 
mind desired may be the formation of a concept — say the 
concept of roundness. In that case the reality consists of 
round objects. You call the attention of the child to 
round objects in order that he may fix his attention upon 
their shape, neglecting all their other qualities. Or the 
play of the mind desired may be the making of a definition 
~—say a definition of roundness. Here the reality is his 
own concept of roundness ; the play of the mind desired is 
the accurate description of that concept. Or the play 
of the mind wanted may be a description of a process — 
say the formulation of a rule in arithmetic. Here there 
are two sets of realities: (1) The conditions stated in the 
problem. You bring them clearly before his mind, in ~ 
order that he may see for himself the path he must take 
in order to reach the solution. (2) Having solved the 
problem, you want him to describe the process, and this 
is the second reality. You want him to fix his mind upon 
it so attentively that he can give an accurate. description 
of it, ; 
In the following example the play of the mind desired 
is an inference from a fact. ‘Your class learns from you 
or a book — so far as the Objective Method is concerned
-P-A-G-E-311
302 CONCEPTION, 
it makes no difference which — that the Constitution of 
the United States forbade Congress to pass any law pro 
hibiting the importation of slaves prior to 1808, and then 
that Congress passed such laws in 1808 -— just as soon as 
the Constitution made it possible for them to do it— 
unanimously. You ask your class what they infer from 
that. They will be likely to say that it indicates that 
Congress wanted to do all it could to limit slavery. With- 
out saying whether they are mistaken or not, you go on 
and tell them of the penalty Congress affixed to the viola- 
tion of the law, and then call their attention to the fact 
that, although the law was constantly violated and every- 
body knew it, this penalty was very rarely inflicted, and 
then ask what that signifies. Here the reality is an 
historical fact, and the play of the mind about the reality 
that you are seeking to occasion is an inference based on 
the reality. 
Why we may Fail to Apply the Objective Method.— 
If we have the clearest possible comprehension of the 
Objective Method, we may fail in our attempts to apply it, 
because we try to bring the minds of our pupils into con- 
tact with realities which they can not comprehend —try, 
in other words, to bring their minds into contact with 
realities with which they can not be brought into contact 
in-their state of development. You could not give a blind 
boy an object lesson baséd on the sense of sight. No 
more can you intelligently use the Objective Method when 
the realities are beyond the range of your pupil’s com- 
prehension. And here we see another reason for making 
a careful study of our pupils: that we may learn what 
realities they can comprehend.

HERBARTIAN STEPS. 303. 
, The Objective Method and the Herbartian Steps. — 
You have doubtless noticed the resemblance between the 
Objective Method, as I have here defined it, and the essen- 
tial steps or stages in method as the Herbartians define 
them. But while they make four and sometimes five steps, 
I have noted but two. As will appear in the discussion 
of apperception, I agree with them in thinking a stage of 
“preparation” important. It is, as I shall endeavor to 
show, a very helpful means of getting “reality” before 
the mind of the pupil. Dr. De Garmo’s term, “ generaliza- 
tion,” to denote what I have called “play of the mind,” 
I object to, because it seems to imply that the action of 
your pupil’s mind which you wish to occasion is in all 
cases intellectual, which is certainly not the case. I omit 
their final stage, application, not because it is not im- 
portant, when it can be taken, but in many cases it can 
not be taken. Can you apply a feeling of admiration or 
appreciation as you can a definition, or a law or a principle 
to the cases that come under it? To illustrate: Take 
any poem, say, Gray’s Elegy in a Country Churchyard. 
Why will you teach it? Do you want your pupils to infer 
from it some law or general principle which they can apply 
to their own observations and experiences? Or do you 
want the thoughts and feelings which the poet thought 
and felt to pass through their minds, in order that they 
may feel their beauty? The latter, I am sure, and such a 
feeling can not be applied. The very idea is absurd.’ 
1 It doubtless has not escaped the attention of my careful readers that 
the Objective Method is based in part on laws of the mind which we have 
not yet considered. Those laws, however, are so generally known that I 
thought it would conduce to clearness to assume that they would be 
known, and discuss the Objective Method in connection with object 
teaching, which is but a single application of it.

LESSON XXXIL 
JUDGMENT. 
Summary of Mental Steps up to the Formation of 
Concepts. — We have seen that our mental life begins 
with undifferentiated sensations ; that the first step towards 
knowledge consists in their gradual transformation into defi- 
nite sensations; that while they are thus being made definite 
they begin to be localized ; that before they are definitély 
localized they begin to be gathered together in groups and 
thought of as qualities of objects; that in the first stage 
of the perception of objects, omly their prominent, salient 
features— those in which small classes resemble each 
other — are perceived, and that, therefore, individuals are 
confused with each other, not perceived as individuals; 
that the state of mind that results from the confusion of 
individuals — the class-image — gradually changes into two 
very unlike things, a percept and a concept; that, on the 
one hand, it becomes a percept through the definite per- - 
ception of differences; on the other, a concept through 
the perception of resemblances between individuals per- 
ceived to be individual. 
Through the greater part of these experiences the mind 
has been active in a way to which, so far, we have paid 
no attention. When we study so complex a thing as the 
human mind, we have to study its various phases or activi-

ties in succession ; but we must remember that what we 
study successively exists contemporaneously. : 
Act of Judgment Illustrated. — We shall get a clearer 
idea of the activity of which I speak if we consider it first 
in a simple and very common form. I see a man coming 
down the street. At first I am uncertain whether it is 
John Smith or his brother. But as I look at him closely 
T notice a scar on his right cheek, just under his eye, and 
then I remember that John Smith once received a severe 
wound there. Immediately my mind passes from its state 
of doubt into a state of certainty; I say, That man is 
John Smith. 
We may then denote the activity which we wish to 
study in a similar manner to that in which we denoted the 
activity of conception. As we said that conception is 
the activity of the mind that enables us to use general 
names intelligently, so we may say that judgment is the 
activity of the mind which is expressed in propositions. 
————— 
FFF. 
Judgment is Sometimes Made Possible by the Laws | 
of Association. — Manifestly such an act of the mind is 
rendered possible by the laws of association. Through the 
laws of association I thought of the name of John Smith 
and of his brother. But there is a wide difference between 
the final act of my mind and the simple result of the laws 
of association. As long as my mental state is due entirely 
to the laws of association, I have a percept and two images 
in mind—the percept of the man before me, and the 
images of John Smith and his brother; but when I see 
the scar — when I am no longer in doubt —the percept 
and the image of John Smith are fused into one, and,
-P-A-G-E-316
WHY THE JUDGMENT WAS CONSCIOUS. 307 
expressing this, I say, This man is John Smith. Sucha 
mental act is called a judgment, and the words in which 
we.express it are called a proposition. 
Why the Judgment was Conscious. — If I had known 
the man was John Smith as soon as I saw him, it is evi- 
dent that there would have been no conscious assertion 
expressed, or capable of being expressed, by the words, 
That man is John Smith. There was a conscious asser- 
tion, because there was, so to speak, a vacillation on the 
part of my percept. It stood midway between my image 
of John Smith and my image of his brother. Because I 
was conscious of this vacillation, 1 was conscious of my 
uncertainty, or rather zz this vacillation my uncertainty 
consisted. But if, as soon as I had seen John Smith, the 
image of him as seen before had coalesced or fused with 
my percept, the act would have been so automatic that I 
should not have been conscious of it. 
You can prove the truth of this by your own experience. 
As you went to school this morning, did you say or think 
to yourself, That is a tree, That is a house, That is a cow, 
as you passed these several objects? No, you merely 
Tecognized them— knew them directly —and were con- 
scious of no mental assertion whatever. But suppose the 
cow had been wrapped in a buffalo robe, so as to look 
unlike any animal you had ever seen before. At a first 
glance you would not have recognized it. There would 
have been the same vacillation between your percept and 
the competing images that we have already observed in 
my experience. But when you had seen through the dis- 
guise, all but one of the competing images would have 
vanished ; you would have performed a conscious mental
-P-A-G-E-317
308 JUDGMENT. 
act that can only be described by a proposition — That is 
a cow. 
When Conscious Judgments First Appear. — We can 
now see at what point in our mental life this conscious act 
first appeared. We have seen that a complete act of 
memory consists of retention, reproduction, recognition, 
and localization, and that memory begins to develop before 
imagination. Evidently, therefore, the mind recognizes 
things before it forms images of them when they .are 
absent. Now this conscious act, which we have called 
judgment, first appears when there is an object before the 
mind of which it has a percept, and when the mind is 
uncertain to which of two images to refer it. Ié a child, 
familiar with oranges, sees a lemon for the first time, he 
at once classes it as an orange because of their likeness — 
there is no conscious act of judgment. But if he is familiar 
with both and the names of both, when he sees an orange 
at a little distance, by the law of association by similarity 
he may think of both an orange and a lemon-—the image *, 
of both may arise in his mind— and his percept may 
vacillate between the two. When he gets nearer, and 
notices the peculiar shape and color of the object, he says, 
That is an orange. Evidently such a conscious act is not 
possible until the imagination is so far developed that two 
or more images arise in the mind in connection with the 
same percept, which the mind is not able to refer to 
either. 
What Judgments Relate to. — If we examine the three 
judgments we have considered — expressed in the proposi-

coalescence of two states of consciousness — a percept and 
an image in the first, a percept and a concept in the 
second and third. We need to note (1) that this fusion or 
coalescence is the way our thoughts sometimes behave 
when we pass from a state of doubt to a state of belief; 
(2) that although it is thoughts or states of consciousness 
that coalesce, the belief does not relate to states of con- 
sciousness, but to some kind of reality? We do not say, 
“My percept of that object fuses with my idea of John 
Smith”; nor, “My percept of that object fuses with my 
concept of cow”; nor, “ My percept of that object fuses 
with my concept of orange.” Though beliefs or judgments 
are rendered possible by states of consciousness, and though 
we may describe the states of consciousness in which judg- 
ments or beliefs consist, judgments do not, as a rule, relate 
to states of consciousness, but always to some kind of 
reality. : 
Different Kinds of Reality Asserted.— The reality 
may be the reality of external nature, as when I say, That 
isan orange. Or the reality of literature. Thousands of 
books have been written upon the question of Hamlet’s 
' insanity. If I say he was insane, my proposition expresses 
a belief about a reality in literature. Or the reality of 
mythology. A student of .the classics, on the way to 
recitation, is running over his lesson in his mind. He asks 
himself, How did Minerva originate? He is in doubt. 
Suddenly something brings the forgotten fact to his mind. 
He remembers that she sprang from the head of Jupiter. 
His memory is an assertion of a reality in mythology. Or

-P-A-G-E-319
310 JUDGMENT. 
it may be a reality of mental facts. I say, The concept 
man and the concept rational animal are one and the same. 
Here the reality asserted is a certain relation between 
mental facts. 
Nature of Act of Judgment. —I£ we examine what 
takes place in our minds when we perform the judgment 
expressed by the proposition, Minerva sprang from the 
head of Jove, we shall see that there is no such fusion or 
coalescence between the thoughts that stand for the sub- 
ject and predicate as takes place when we judge That is 
John Smith. The reason plainly is because of the dif- 
ference in the things asserted. In the last case we assert 
identity. I see that the individual before me has all the 
characteristics of John Smith, because he zs John Smith. 
In the first, we make an assertion about the origin of 
Minerva; we say not that she is, but that she sprang from, 
the head of Jove. So when I say, I dreamed last night, 
I make a still different assertion —I assert a different 
kind of fact. But no matter what we assert, we shall find, 
in the period of doubt that preceded the assertion, no fixed 
relations between the thoughts or concepts or states of 
mind that represent the various parts of the proposition 
that we finally assert. “I don’t know whether that is 
John Smith or his brother.” As long as I am in un- 
certainty, my percept tends now towards the image of 
John Smith, now towards that of his brother, according to 
my estimate of probabilities. When I pass from a state 
of doubt to a state of certainty, my percept assumes a 
definite and fixed relation towards the image of John Smith. 
“T don’t remember whether Minerva sprang from the head 
of Jupiter or the head of Apollo.” Here again there is
-P-A-G-E-320
QUESTIONS. gil 
the same lack of definiteness and fixedness in the relations 
between the thoughts expressed by Minerva, sprang from, 
head of Jupiter, head of Apollo, But when I say: “I re- 
member ow — she sprang from the head of Jupiter,” this 
lack of definiteness disappears; they are transformed into 
a new whole, or rather the first three are, each of them 
sustaining a definite and fixed relation towards the rest — 
a relation which they resume whenever I think of them, 
unless my belief changes. 
Judgment Defined. — We see, then, not only that a 
judgment is that act of the mind which is expressed in a 
proposition, but we see what the act.is. /7 is the mental 
assertion of some kind of reality — the transformation or 
relating of separate units or elements of thought into one 
whole, in which each sustains definite and fixed relations 
to the rest.

LESSON XXXIV. 
JUDGMENT. 
(Continued) 
Difference between Association of Ideas and Judg- 
ment.—JI said in the last lesson that there is a wide 
difference between the mere association of ideas and judg- 
ment. There is hardly an assertion in this book which it 
is of greater importance for you to verify at great length 
bya study of your own experience than this. Take 
proposition after proposition and make clear to yourself 
the difference between merely associating the subject and 
predicate in your mind, and thinking them in the relation 
of a judgment. 
Suppose, for example, you should have a conversation 
with a man from the moon, and should explain to him the 
meaning of water, quench, and thirst, without showing 
him the relations which these facts actually bear to each 
other. When he thinks of the three at the same time, 
they have only a mechanical connection in his mind — the 
same kind of connection that exists in the mind of a child 
between the thought of a Chinaman and the thought of a 
steam-engine when the child thinks of the two at the same 
time because he first saw them together. But when you 
think of them together, you assert a real relation between 
the facts wader and ¢hirst— they are no longer mechani- 
312

ESSENCE OF AN ACT OF JUDGMENT. 313. 
cally juxtaposed, but parts of one logical whole, you think 
them in the relation of a judgment. 
Take also the proposition, “ Napoleon conquered Europe.” 
Do you not see the difference between merely thinking 
about “Napoleon,” “conquered,” and “ Europe” at the 
same time, and thinking the judgment, “Napoleon con- 
quered Europe”? The first might be possible through 
the association of ideas alone. 
Essence of an Act of Judgment. — There is a conscious 
mental assertion only when this act of logical relating for 
some reason becomes a matter of attention. You say, 
That is a cow, only after you have been in doubt as to 
what animal you are looking at, or when you see it in some 
unexpected place, as in a public park. Some psychologists 
confine the term judgment to these conscious assertions of 
the mind. Assertions made unconsciously they refuse to 
call judgments, simply because they are made uncon- 
sciously. But assuredly those psychologists take the 
sounder position who hold that whenever thoughts assume 
that fixed and definite relation we have seen they have in 
a judgment, whenever they’ become parts of a logical 
whole, there is an act of judgment, whether the act is 
conscious or not. The essence of an act of. judgment cOn- 
sists in this logical relating’ of thoughts. To refuse to 
call it a judgment because it takes place so rapidly and 
unobtrusively as to escape the eye of consciousness is to 
use language in a way that does not conduce to clearness 
of thinking. , : 
Implicit and Explicit Judgments. — We may, indeed, 
properly enough mark the distinction between them by
-P-A-G-E-323
314 JUDGMENT. 
putting them into different classes. We may call the 
judgments made unconsciously, implicit, and those made 
consciously, explicit. Evidently the mind made implicit 
judgments when it contemplated what we have called 
class-images. Evidently, also, when the consciousness of 
a class-image becomes the perception of an individual 
thing, the judgment is still implicit. And as every modifi- 
cation of a class-image in the direction of an individual 
is an act of implicit judgment, so every modification of 
a concept is an act of explicit judgment. If the first con- 
cept that the child makes of a rose is not of a rose as a 
rose, but as a plant, it is the result of an act of judgment 
— This is a plant. When he modifies his concept so as 
to make it include some of the attributes of a flower, 
this. modification is still the work of a judgment — This 
plant is a flower. When he modifies it still further to 
make it include some of the attributes of roses, and then 
of that variety of roses called La France, it is still the 
work of judgment — This flower is a rose, this rose is a 
La France. In: a word, the formation of a concept and 
each step in itscsubsequent modification is the work of the 
mind as judgment. 
Different Kinds of Judgments. — Explicit judgments 
are usually classified according to the propositions used 
to express them. “This man is a lawyer,” a categorical 
proposition, is said to express a categorical judgment. 
“This man is either a lawyer or a doctor,” a disjunctive 
proposition, is said to express a disjunctive judgment. «If 
this man is a lawyer, he is not a doctor,” a conditional 
proposition, is said to express a conditional judgment. But 
we can not ascertain the character of a judgment by
-P-A-G-E-324
DIFFERENT KINDS OF JUDGMENTS. 315 
examining the proposition used to express it. A categort- 
cal judgment is one in which the predicate is asserted of 
the subject absolutely and unconditionally. Now, a cate- 
gorical proposition may be the expression of that kind of 
a judgment, and it may not be. One man says, The sun 
will rise to-morrow morning, and his proposition expresses 
a categorical judgment — the possibility even that the sun 
will not rise has scarcely occurred to him. An astronomer 
says the same thing, but mentally qualifies his assertion — 
Lf nothing happens to the earth or the sun to prevent it. 
A metaphysician. mentally qualifies the same assertion 
with the condition-— If things behave in. the future as 
they have done in the past The last two use a categori- 
cal proposition to express a conditional judgment. So, 
likewise, a conditional proposition may be used to express 
a categorical judgment. I say —TIf he is a lawyer, he is 
not a doctor. I mean, Men do not practice law and medi- 
cine at the same time, which is a categorical judgment. 
A child says, If I do not cry, mamma will give me candy 
—meaning simply that she will get the candy if she does 
not cry, and therefore her conditional prop: sition expresses 
a conditional judgment. 
When we make a judgment about an entire class, our 
judgment is universal; when about a part of a class, it is 
particular. All trees have branches, is a proposition ex- 
pressing a judgment about the entire class of trees; it is, 
therefore, universal. Some trees are green in winter, is a 
proposition expressing a judgment about a part ofia-class; 
it is, therefore, particular. Affirmative judgments are those 
in which something is affirmed; negative, those in which 
something is denied.

316 JUDGMENT. 
Judgments and Processes of Reasoning. —The com- 
mon opinion is that the beliefs (judgments) of men — 
excepting those that we have called necessary truths and 
necessary beliefs — are based on processes of reasoning. 
Nothing can be more erroneous. 
Children’s Judgments. — The credulity of children is 
proverbial; but if we get our facts at first hand, if we 
study “the living, learning, playing child,” we shall see 
that he is quite as remarkable for incredulity as for credu- 
lity. The explanation is simple: He ends to believe the 
first suggestion that comes into his mind, no matter from 
what source; and since his belief is not the result of any 
rational process, he can not be made to disbelieve it in any 
rational way. Wence it happens that he is very credulous 
in reference to any matter about which he has no ideas; 
but let the idea once get possession of his mind, and he is 
quite as remarkable for incredulity as before for credulity. 
A father was showing his little girl— three years old — 
a cistern, and she was looking at it with great interest, 
when she suddenly drew back, and cried out, in a frightened 
tone, “Oh, papa, you are going to put me in there!” and 
no amount of persuasion would induce her to consent to 
look at it again, although the father had never threatened 
her with any kind of physical punishment, and there was 
absolutely nothing in her experience which would serve 
as a reason for her belief. The explanation is that the 
idea occurred to her, and its mere presence in her mind 
was a sufficient cause for belief. The same child got in a 
passion of fear because her father playfully remarked, one 
day when he had a caller, that she must stay with him to 
keep the man from hurting him. Not anticipating any

such effect from his remark, he tried to soothe her by 
assuring her that it was not so, that he was only playing; 
but all to no purpose. She did not believe it because 
he said it — because of her trust in him — and therefore 
she would not disbelieve it when he said it was not so. 
Study your “elementary text-book,” and you will find 
“abundant illustrations of this truth: that belief about 
everything that comes within the range of a child’s ex- 
perience antedates reason ; that what reason does, for. the 
most part, in the early years of a child’s life, is to cause 
him to abandon beliefs that are plainly at variance with 
experience. 
Judgments of Uneducated Men. —If we study the 
larger child——the man with a child’s mind—an un- 
educated man — we shall have the same truth forced upon 
us. If the beliefs of men were due to processes of reason- 
ing, where they have not reasoned they would not believe. 
But do we find it so? Is it not true that the men who 
have the most positive opinions on the largest variety of 
subjects — so far as they have ever heard of them -— are 
precisely those who have the least right to them? Socrates, 
we remember, was counted the wisest man in Athens, 
because he alone resisted his natural tendency to believe 
in the absence of evidence; he alone would not delude 
himself with the conceit of knowledge without the reality; 
and it tvould scarcely be too much to say that the intel- 
lectual strength of men is in inverse proportion to the 
number of things they are absolutely certain of. If this 
be true, it is hard to overestimate the importance of the 
work that education should do in this direction. How to 
make men believe what is true, how to keep them from
-P-A-G-E-327
318 ~ JUDGMENT. 
believing what is false, how to keep them from having 
opinions upon matters in reference to which their study 
and investigation, or rather the lack of both, give them 
no right to an opinion, is surely a question of the very 
greatest importance.' Manifestly the way to answer it is 
to bring up the rational side of the mind, to develop it and 
train it so that it may be strong enough to cope with the 
believing —— judging — propensities of the mind. What 
we can do in this direction, therefore, it will be proper for 
us to discuss after we have made a study of reasoning.

11 do not, of course, mean to intimate that we should have no opinions 
about matters that we have not personally investigated. We take and 
ought to take the opinion of some men about law, and others about 
medicine, and others about particular sciences, and so on. But we should 
clearly realize the difference between holding an opinion on trust and hold- 
ing it as the result of our own investigations. If we do, we shall see we 
have no right to an opinion at all—on trust — where there is a decided 
difference of opinion among specialists. If all I know about the appear- 
ance of a thing I have learned from the reports of two men, and if these 
are directly opposed to each other on all the essential points, then plainly 
I know nothing about it. In like manner, if I take my conclusions from 
specialists—as I must to be reasonable, when I have not studied the 
matter — then, when they disagree widely, there is no reason why I should 
take the opinion of one rather than another. I have, therefore, in such a

LESSON XXXV. 
. REASONING, 
Héffding on Children’s Judgments. — We saw in the 
last lesson that children send to believe the first suggestion 
that comes into their minds, no matter from what source. 
Some psychologists go much farther than this. Hoffding, 
for instance, says: “It must be with dawning conscious- 
ness as with dream consciousness— all that offers is at 
first taken for current coin,”! since to such a conscious- 
ness there is no ground for a distinction between the 
world of possibility and the world of fact and reality. 
This argument is that, from the very nature of the mind, 
it follows that, in the beginning of its mental life, a child 
must accept its ideas or suggestions as true? But we 
1 Outlines of Psychology, p. 131. 
2 That acute critic and profound student of human nature, Walter 
Bagehot, wrote a suggestive paragraph on this point: “In true meta- 
physics, I believe that, contrary to common opinion, unbelief far oftener 
needs a reason and requires an effort than belief. Naturally, and if man 
were made according to the pattern of the logicians, he would say: ‘When 
I see a valid argument, I will believe; and till Isee such argument, I will 
not believe.’ But, in fact, every idea vividly before us soon appears tq us 
to be true, unless we keep our perceptions of the arguments which prove 
it untrue, and voluntarily coerce our minds to remember its falsehood. 
* All clear ideas are true,’ was for ages a philosophical maxim; and though 
no maxim can be more unsound, none can be more exactly conformable te

- CHILDREN’S REASONING. 321 
have here nothing to do with such a frzorz reasoning. 
Our business is to make a patient study of facts; to care- 
fully observe children, in order that we may learn whether 
there is a tendency to believe as true every suggestion 
that enters their minds; and if so, to what extent. But 
here, as always, we must guard against the propensity 
which, as we have seen, is such an active principle of 
human nature—the disposition to let our beliefs run. 
clean out of sight of the facts upon which they are based, 
and assert a universal conclusion upon the basis of a few 
observations of two or three children. Knowing the influ- 
ence of feeling on belief, one would naturally suppose that 
children would be more likely to show the tendency in 
reference to matters that excite their feelings. So far as _ 
my observations go, they tend to confirm the truth of this 
supposition, We should expect also that children of a 
decidedly emotional temperament would be more likely to 
show it than those of a quieter temperament. But plainly 
we have no right to an opinion on this point until we have 
observed a large number of children, or until we have care- 
fully studied the results of competent observers. 
Children’s Reasoning. — But the child very soon begins 
to form judgments that we can put into quite a different 
class. When he sees a train coming, and runs into the 
house because he is afraid of it, his judgment, The train 
will hurt. me if I stay in the yard, is the result of the 
ordinary human nature. The child resolutely accepts every idea which 
passes through its brain as true; it has no distinct conception of an idea 
which is strong, bright, and permanent, but which is false too. The mere 
presentation of an idea, unless we are careful about it, or unless there is 
within some unusual resistance, makes us believe it.”
-P-A-G-E-331
322 REASONING. 
mere presence of the suggestion in his mind. The sugges- 
tion, of course, is due to the association of ideas; the 
belief, however, is due, as we have just seen, to quite 
another cause, But when a child, who was burned by his 
soup yesterday, refuses to touch it to-day because he sees it 
smoking, his judgment, The soup will burn me of I put it in 
my mouth, is probably not to be explained in the same way. 
He does, of course, think of the possible burn because of the 
association of ideas, but he believes it because of a process 
that might be roughly described as follows: Yesterday's 
soup smoked and burned me; therefore to-day’s soup, which 
smokes also, will burn me. He makes a judgment about 
past experience the ground of a judgment about future 
experience; he goes from the known to the unknown. 
A little boy once made the direct assertion, “Snow is 
sugar ; for snow is white, and sois sugar.”? Because snow 
and sugar are both white, he concluded that they are the 
same. 
Reasoning Defined.—-Let us see if we can find any 
judgment to serve as a basis or reason for the first one. 
Does the child think, The train will hurt me if I stay in 
the yard because other trains have hurt me there? or 
because mamma told me it would hurt me if I stayed 
there? No. He does not base the judgment on any- 
thing; he assumes it. He does not go from the known 
to the unknown; he assumes the unknown. His belief is 
not mediate — reached through other beliefs — but imme. 
diate. Now, the process of basing judgments on judg- 
ments—of reaching beliefs through beliefs—is called 
reasoning. Reasoning, then, is the act of going from the

known to the unknown through other beliefs, of basing 
judgments on judgments, reaching beliefs through beliefs. 
Difficulty of Determining whether an Action is the 
Result of Reasoning or of the Association of Ideas. — 
It is often impossible to tell whether a given. action has 
been performed as the result of a mere process of associa- 
tion, or of a genuine reasoning process. Take the case 
just mentioned of the child who refuses to touch smoking 
soup because he was burned yesterday. I have explained 
his action as due to a reasoning process. But is any other 
explanation possible? Certainly. It is altogether possible 
that the perception of the smoking soup to-day makes him 
think of the soup of yesterday, and that, of the pain he 
experienced, and that this thought of the pain causes him 
to refrain from eating soup to-day all through merely 
mechanical association. If his mental processes were as 
I described them abeve, then he reasoned. But if his 
action is due to mechanical association alone, we can not 
describe his mental processes as consisting of a succession 
of related judgments, but of unrelated percepts and ideas 
which would have been judgments of they had been brought 
into certain definite relations with each other. “Yester- 
day’s soup smoked and burned; therefore to-day’s soup, 
which smokes also, will burn me” — may be regarded as 
a rough description of his mental process #f he reasons. 
But if he does not reason, percept of to-day’s soup, thought 
of yesterday’s soup, yesterday’s pain — these one after the 
other without being brought into judgments — may be the 
elements in consciousness which precede his action. Even 
if he believes that the soup will burn him to-day — because 
of his experience yesterday, but not because he sees any

connection between the two, his mental process ts nota 
case of reasoning. If he says, Smoking soup burned me 
yesterday, smoking soup will burn me to-day — if these 
two propositions accurately and completely express his 
conscious processes, he does not reason. But if he says 
or thinks, Smoking soup burned me yesterday, cherefore it 
will burn me to-day, the action of his mind exhibits the 
distinctive characteristics of the reasoning process: he 
believes one proposition on the ground of another; he 
makes one proposition a reason for believing another. 
A Story about Ants. — Such considerations put us in 
a position to form an intelligent opinion of some of the - 
wonderful stories reported of animal intelligence. Take 
the story about ants which Romanes reports on the author- 
ity of an English clergyman: “I have noticed in one of 
my formicaria a subterranean cemetery, where I have seen 
some ants burying their dead by placing earth above them. 
One ant was evidently much affected, and tried to exhume 
the bodies ; but the united exertions of the yellow sextons 
were more than sufficient for the disconsolate mourner.” 
The Action Explained. — In considering ‘such an in- 
cident the first thing to do is to disentangle the facts from 
the snarl of inferences. What then are the facts, the 
observed facts? That the body of a dead ant was covered 
up, and that another ant tried to prevent it. Is there 
anything about this which requires to be explained as a 
reasoning process? By no means. Ants have a habit of 
removing anything that is in their way, and this habit — 
which is probably entirely due to instinct — explains their 
so-called burial of the dead ant. As to the grief of the
-P-A-G-E-334
i 
A STORY OF.A DOG. 325 
disconsolate mourner — how did the observer happen to 
learn the signs of grief in ants? I know when you are 
grieved. Why? Because you manifest it in the same way 
that I do— by the expression of your countenance, and so 
on. Did the countenance of the ant take on a sorrowful 
expression? Plainly the grief of the ant was an inference, 
and a gratuitous one at that. Granted that the ant at- 
tempted to prevent the so-called burial: did he do it 
because he was grieved or for some cause with which we 
are entirely unacquainted? The latter is surely the more 
reasonable supposition. 
A Story of a Dog. — Professor James reports an incident 
of animal intelligence which would at once be set down by 
careless observers as a case of reasoning. “A friend of 
the writer gave as a proof of the almost human intelligence 
of his dog that he took him one day down to his boat on 
the shore, but found the boat full of dirt and water. He 
remembered that the sponge was up at the house a third 
of a mile distant; but, disliking to go back himself, he 
made various gestures of wiping out the boat, and so forth, 
saying to his terrier, ‘Sponge, sponge, go fetch the sponge.’ 
But he had little expectation of a result since the dog had 
never received the slightest training with the boat or the 
sponge. Nevertheless, off he trotted to the house, and, to 
his owner’s great surprise and admiration, brought the 
sponge in his jaws.” 
The Action Explained. — Was this a case of reasoning? 
Not necessarily. The probabilities are that the owner’s 
gestures and language suggested the sponge by mechanical 
association. If, as Professor James says, he had been un-
-P-A-G-E-335
326 REASONING. 
able to find the sponge, and had brought back a mop ora 
dipper it would have been clearly a case of reasoning. His 
actions in that case would have been due to a perception 
of the re/ation between the dipper and the use to which it 
was to be put — to the perception of the fact that for his 
owner’s purpose dipper and sponge were the same thing. 
Such a perception could not be explained as consisting of 
mechanical association. 
Reasoning from Particular to Particular.—If we 
examine our minds to see the course they take in the 
reasonings of every-day life, we shall find that we generally 
reason from some particular fact to some particular fact. 
You are going to take a train at half-past eleven, and you 
must give yourself ten minutes to go to the depot. You 
look at your watch; the hands indicate that it is fifteen 
minutes past eleven. Remembering that it was five min- 
utes slow yesterday, you hurry off at once. Why? Because 
you believe it is twenty minutes past eleven, since your 
watch was five minutes slow yesterday. Because your watch 
was five minutes slow yesterday, you believe it is five min. 
utes slow to-day; you reason from a particular fact to a 
particular fact. As you go out of the gate you notice 
threatening clouds in the west. You go back and get your 
umbrella, as you think it is likely to rain. From the par- 
ticular judgment, The clouds look thus and so, you go

‘the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning. 
In either deductive or inductive reasoning the mind may 
start from particular facts. But when the mind retraces 
its steps in order to find the proof of its conclusion, it may 
find it either in a general proposition, or in particular 
propositions. In the first case the reasoning is called 
| deductive; in the second, txductive. Deductive and in- 
ductive reasoning, then, are not so much two kinds of 
reasoning as two modes of proof — two modes of exhibit, 
ing to ourselves or others the grounds of inferences already 
drawn. ‘When we prove a conclusion by a general pro- 
position, the reasoning is called deductive; when by par- 
ticular propositions, it is called inductive.

Difference between Inductive and Deductive Reason- 
ing.—-We saw in the last lesson that the difference © 
between deductive and inductive reasoning is rather a 
difference in the method of proving conclusions already 
inferred than a difference in the method of inferring them; 
that when we appeal to a universal proposition to prove 
our conclusion, the reasoning is called deductive; induc- 
tive when we appeal to one or more particular propo- 
sitions. 
Why does the same Method of Reasoning sometimes 
lead to a True, and sometimes to a False Conclusion ? 
— But how is that I am able to find the proof of a fact in 
particular propositions? When you say, “I know that 
this is a Maréchal Niel because I know that all the roses 
that have the characteristics of this rose are Maréchal 
Niels,” if I disagree with you it is because I do not believe 
your premise. Admitting your premise, that all the roses 
that have the characteristics of this rose are Maréchal 
Niels, I must admit your conclusion. But when the child 
argues, “ Sugar is white, snow is white, therefore snow is 
sugar,” I admit his premises, but deny his conclusion. But 
when he argues, “ This and that and the other unsupported 
329°
-P-A-G-E-339
330 REASONING, 
bodies have fallen; this stone is an unsupported body, 
therefore it will fall,” I admit the truth of his conclusion. 
In both cases he argues from true particular propositions. 
We have to inquire (1) how he came to choose those par- 
ticulars.in order to prove his conclusion ; and (2) how it 
happened that apparently the same method led, in one 
case, to a false conclusion ; in the other, to a true one. 
We Base Affirmative Conclusions on Likenesses, but 
never on Differences.—I think we shall see how to 
answer the first question if we ask ourselves if a child can 
believe that snow is sugar because the one is white and 
the other sweet. We know that he can not. We know 
that children-—human beings in general--reason from 
observed likenesses to unobserved likenesses, but never 
From differences to affirmative conclusions. We know 
that the child argued that snow is sugar because sow 
and sugar resemble each other in being white — because 
they belong to the class of white objects. The proof, ina 
word, that snow is sugar he found in the fact that both 
are white. He took one white thing — sugar —to be the 
type of all white things—-judged implicitly that all white 
things are sugar. He argued, then, that snow is sugar 
because it is one of the class of white things, all of which 
are sugar. 
He selects the particular propositions, This unsupported 
object has fallen, That unsupported object has fallen, etc., 
to prove that the stone will fall if it is unsupported, for 
the same reason. Can he believe that a stone will fall 
because a robin flies, and a geranium bears blossoms, and 
a maple puts forth leaves in spring-time? Certainly not. 
These facts and the one he believes do not resemble each
-P-A-G-E-340
LIKENESSES, BUT NOT DIFFERENCES. 331 
| other —are not members of a class. We believes that an 
unsupported stone will fall, on the ground that this and 
that and the other body have done so, because he takes 
this, that, and the other body as types of the class. He 
has made a class of unsupported bodies, and has judged 
that those he has observed are exampies of the entire class. 
When, then, he reasons that the stone will fall if unsup- 
ported, because this and that and the other body have done 
so, he really reasons that it will do so because all unsup- 
ported bodies will do so. We see, then, that there is 
no essential difference between inductive and deductive 
reasoning. When I prove a particular fact by other par- 
| ticular facts, I do so because they are members of the _ 
same class as the one about which I am trying to prove 
something, and because I have already, explicitly or im- 
plicitly, reached a conclusion about the entire class. When 
a universal judgment is consciously appealed to, the reason- 
ing is deductive; when it is unconsciously appealed to, it 
is said to be inductive; and that is the sole difference 
between deductive and inductive reasoning. I say, “I am 
going to die sometime.” You ask, “Why?” “Because 
all men are mortal.” There I appeal consciously to a 
universal proposition. If I reply, “ Because this and that 
and the other man have died,” I certainly appeal, per- 
haps unconsciously, to a universal proposition, since it is 
only because this and that and the other individual and I 
are members of the same class that what has happened 
to them throws any light on what is likely to happen 
to me. 
We see, then, that we appeal to certain particular 
propositions te prove a fact, because they are included in 
a universal judgment that we have made.
-P-A-G-E-341
332 : REASONING. 
All Inductive Reasoning is Deductive Reasoning. — 
Now, we see why the same kind of reasoning sometimes 
leads to a true conclusion and sometimes to one that is 
false. All inductive reasoning is deductive reasoning. 
When the universal implied by the particulars is false, the 
conclusion based upon it will be false. All white things 
are not sugar. Hence it is a mistake to say that snow is 
sugar because it is white. All unsupported bodies will 
fall. Hence I am justified in concluding that this stone 
will, because this and that and the other bodies have done 
so when I take them to be types of the class. 
The proof in deductive reasoning may always be thrown 
into the following form called a syllogism : 
(Major premise.) Ail white things are sugar ; 
(Minor premise.) Snow is a white thing ; 
(Conclusion.) Therefore, snow is sugar. 
Why Able Men so often Differ. — We see here very 
plainly again that an act of reasoning may be altogether 
correct as a process, and yet lead to a false conclusion, 
because one of the premises is incorrect. That enables us 
to see why able men so often differ with each other; they 
start from different premises. Take the great differences 
you find between men in matters of politics, science — 
every department of thought — and you will often find 
that they rest at bottom on the fact that those who differ 
started from different major premises. A’ physicist or. 
physiologist, for example, is very likely to believe that 
nothing can cause a change in matter but matter. If so, 
he is almost certain to be a materialist, since the changes 
in the body that we usually attribute to consciousness, he 
will attribute to the brain. His reasoning may be thrown
-P-A-G-E-342
WHY ABLE MEN SO OFTEN DIFFER. 333 
into the form of a syllogism: Nothing can cause a change 
in matter but matter. But consciousness is not matter. 
Therefore, consciousness can not cause a change in the 
body. A psychologist, on the other hand, may assume 
that nothing can have the characteristics that the mind 
has. without having some of the attributes of a substance. 
If so, he will not be a materialist. His reasoning may. be 
thrown into the following syllogism: Nothing can have 
such characteristics as the mind has without being a sub- 
stance. But the mind can not be a substance if mental 
facts are mere phenomena of the brain. Therefore mental 
facts are not mere phenomena of the brain. One man 
says, “All measures that tend to promote home production 
are beneficial. A protective tariff does this; therefore a 
protective tariff is beneficial.” Another says, “Undoubt- 
edly your conclusion is true if your major premise is, but 
I deny your major premise. I hold that what promotes 
the interests of individuals promotes the interests of na- 
tions.” Here we have an argument leading to a conclu. 
sion that directly contradicts the first, because it starts 
from a major premise that contradicts the major premise 
of the first argument. Compare the argument of Ex- 
Speaker Reed in the North American Review, January, 
1890, with the reply of Senator Carlisle —the former 
defending the rules of the House of Representatives that 
had just been adopted by the Republican majority, the 
latter severely criticising them. Reed reasons substantially 
as follows: Whatever rules are necessary to enable the 
House to transact business are wise; the rules adopted by 
the Republicans are necessary to enable the House to 
transact business; therefore they are wise. Carlisle, on 
the other hand, reasons substantially as follows : Whatever
-P-A-G-E-343
334 REASONING. 
tules enable the Speaker of the House to exercise arbitrary 
and tyrannical power are unwise; the rules just adopted 
by the House enable the Speaker to exercise arbitrary and 
tyrannical power ; therefore they are unwise. 
Why Able Men Start from Different Premises. -- If 
you ask how it happens that able men so often start from 
different premises, you ask a difficult question. One reason 
undoubtedly is, that the imagination, as we have seen, is 
the sole audience chamber in which Reality gets a hear- 
ing. If for any reason we do not image certain aspects or 
phases of Reality, they are for us as though they did not 
exist. The great majority of the facts to which the phys- 
icist habitually gives his attention are so well explained by 
his assumption, that it comes finally to seem like an abso- 
lute certainty — precisely as we are inclined to think it 
absolutely certain that things will behave in the future as 
they have done in the past. When he occasionally thinks 
of facts that seem to contradict his assumption, he refuses 
to believe them. That which is absolutely true can not 
be contradicted, however it may seem to be. Sometimes 
we refuse, more or less consciously, to consider but one 
side of a question. If we are interested in supporting a 
particular conclusion, it often happens that we will not 
look at the other side Members of debating societies 
generally come to believe that their side is right, whatever 
they thought at the start. They are looking for arguments 
on but one side, and they see no others. The Republicans 
in the House all voted for the Republican rules in 18809, 
and the Democrats against them. A few of both parties, 
perhaps, voted dishonestly, but I have no doubt that the 
great majority voted honestly. The Republicans were
-P-A-G-E-344
ABLE MEN AND DIFFERENT PREMISES, 335 
interested in having their rules adopted, and looked for 
arguments to justify their course; the Democrats were 
interested in having them rejected, and looked for argu- 
ments to justify their course. 
History abounds in illustrations of the effects of interest 
on belief. 
Every one who has studied the history of Calhoun 
knows that a great change began to take place in his 
opinions about the year 1825. Before that time he had 
been an advocate of a protective tariff, a national bank, 
internal improvements, a liberal interpretation of the Con- 
stitution. About 1825 his opinions on all these questions 
began to undergo a change, and in a few years he had 
completely wheeled about. The explanation is, that about 
this time he had begun to see that slavery was the control- 
ling interest of the South, and that the only constitutional 
weapon with which it could be defended was the doctrine 
of State rights. Under the influence of this perception 
the only facts that he permitted himself to realize (imagine) 
were those that supported his favorite doctrine. 
Andrew Jackson’s history abounds in illustrations of this 
kind. No man could be his friend and disagree with him. 
He was not only a very sincere patriot, but he was sure 
he was right, and therefore that everybody who disagreed 
with him was wrong. What seemed true to him seemed 
so self-evident that he could not understand how a man 
could honestly and honorably differ with him. His feel- 
ings not only determined his beliefs, but gave them such 
intensity that he could not conceive that any one could 
really doubt them. 
The history of men like Alexander Hamilton and Jeffer- 
son fives still different illustrations of this truth. Because
-P-A-G-E-345
336 REASONING. 
of natural differences between the things they liked, they 
inclined to start from different premises in their political 
reasonings. Jefferson naturally trusted the people and 
believed in their political capacity, because of his optimistic 
temperament and because of his hatred of any form of 
government which made tyranny possible. Without Jeffer- 
son’s optimism and Jefferson’s hatred of a form of govern- 
ment which made tyranny possible, and with a strong love 
of order and stability, Hamilton as naturally believed in 
a strong government—-one strong enough to hold the 
people in check — as did Jefferson in a weak one, because 
he did not think the people needed much governmental 
restraint. 
Two Things to be Done in Training the Reasoning 
Powers of Pupils. — From this point of view, it is clear 
that there are two things to be done in the training of the 
Teasoning powers of our pupils: (1) To train them to 
reason correctly from given premises; and (2) to give 
them such training as will diminish, as much as possible, 
the influence of personal considerations in selecting the 
premises upon which they base their reasoning —to give 
them such a love of truth that it will be able to neutralize 
the influence of all merely personal preferences and wishes. 
What we want to believe has a great influence on what we 
do believe, but it has no influence in determining what 
is true. 
Calhoun and the South wanted to believe that slavery 
was right, and they did; but that did not make it right. 
In order to defend slavery, they wanted to believe that the 
doctrine of State rights was true, and they did; but that did 
not make it true. Their attempt to put it in practice, hhow-
-P-A-G-E-346
REASONING POWERS OF PUPILS. 337 
ever resulted in one of the most fearful civil wars of which 
history gives us any account. Yet all that can be done, 
it seems to me, in the way of diminishing the influence of 
personal considerations in determining premises, is, in the 
first place, to point out the great danger of such influences. 
We have considered examples of such influences from 
history; you need not go to history to find them in abun- 
dance. Incidents at school, if you are on the lookout for 
them, will give you ample opportunity to bring home to 
your pupils the fact that there is great danger of their 
being led to believe this or that, not because a candid sur- 
vey of all the facts shows that it is most probable, but 
because they wish to believe it. In the second place, we 
can set them a good example. I do not know how United 
States history can be taught profitably except by constant 
teference to current events. Mr, Freeman well says that 
“History is past politics and politics present history”; 
and the teacher of United States history should constantly 
try to illustrate “past politics” by “present politics,” and 
show ‘how “present politics” are the necessary results of 
the politics of the past. But to do this profitably — to do 
it without exciting the prejudices of his pupils —he must 
make it very evident that in all the questions he discusses, 
his supreme desire is to get at the truth. And he must 
teally Aave that desire. In these and all other questions 
he should not only allow, but encourage, the utmost free- 
dom of discussion. And when his pupils have pointed out 
an error in his reasonings— which they are sure to do 
sometimés — he should acknowledge it instantly, and thus 
show his supreme deference to truth.

LESSON XXXVII 
REASONING. 
(Continued.) 
We have seen that the only difference between inductive 
and deductive reasoning is that the one is based on an 
implicit and the other on an explicit universal. 
We will now consider that kind of deductive reasoning 
that is usually called induction, and to avoid circumlocution 
I will give it the name that it usually bears. 
Relation of Induction to Generalization. — Induction 
very closely resembles generalization. Generalization, you 
remember, is the last of the three processes involved in the 
formation of a concept. A child directs his attention to 
two or more objects at the same time — comparison — and 
after noting their like and unlike qualities, fixes his atten- 
tion upon the former — abstraction — and thinks of them 
as the characteristics of a class generalization. But 
there is no going from the known to the unknown, and, 
consequently, no reasoning in the act of generalization. 
When a child, noting that two or more objects resembling 
| each other in a number of particulars, and all used to sit 
in, thinks of the qualities in which they resemble each 
other as the characteristics of a class— extends, in other 
words, the name given to them to all objects possessing 
similar qualities —he does not make an inference about 
339  
-P-A-G-E-349
340 REASONING. 
the objects he does not see. He does not say that since 
these chairs have this and that and the other quality, 
therefore all chairs have them —that would be an induc. 
tion. But he says, Since these objects are alike in cer- 
tain respects, I will make a class of them, and 7 there 
are any other objects that possess the same qualities, I 
will put them in the same class—call them by the same 
name. 
Of course a child does not definitely think any such 
thoughts. We know that there is a great difference be- 
tween what the mind really does and what it is conscious 
of doing. And when a child sees two objects and calls 
them dogs—thus putting them in the same class—and 
when seeing another dog, he says, “dog” — putting it in 
the same class——it is plain that his mind has taken the 
course I have endeavored to describe. This is generaliza- 
tion. But there is a wide difference between generalization 
(making a class of objects) and induction (concluding be- 
cause one or more members of a class have such and such 
characteristics, therefore they all have it; or because some- 
thing is true of one or more members of a class, therefore 
it will be true of all). In the one case, we are merely 
arranging objects into classes; in the other, we reason 
from one or more members of the class to the entire 
class. 
From this it is evident that induction presupposes gen- 
eralization. If in induction I reason from one or more 
members of.a class to the whole class, I must have the 
idea of the class already formed in my mind. : 
We have already seen that inductive reasoning assumes 
that certain individuals are types of an entire class. Let 
us consider this further.
-P-A-G-E-350
INDUCTIVE REASONING. -— 341 
Two Assumptions Underlying All Inductive Reason- 
ing. When I reason that all crows are black because all 
the crows I have seen were black, I assume that the crows 
Thave seen are'types or examples of the entire class. This 
assumption that we can tegard a greater or less number 
of individuals as types of a class clearly underlies a large 
part of our inductions, and we never can be quite sure in 
any case that we have a right to make it. Of course, it 
is more likely to be true when the instances which we 
assume to represent the entire class are very numerous, 
But, no matter how many cases we have examined, it will 
always be possible that some member of the class that we 
have not seen may be unlike those we have seen. 
An hypothesis is an assumption that we make to account 
for facts. Our minds are of such a nature that we feel a 
certain uneasiness when we know a fact that we can not 
explain, and therefore it is natural for us to try to make 
some hypothesis or supposition to accourit for any fact we 
know. And since, of course, we do not make improbable 
suppositions to account for facts, or rather since we do not 
make suppositions that seem to us improbable, we are 
inclined to regard them as true, so long as they explain 
the facts. And this is another assumption upon which the 
greater part, if not all, of our inductions are based. 
This assumption can not be so definitely stated as the 
preceding one. It would not be correct to state it in this 
form: An hypothesis which explains facts is true. For 
one great reason why people differ from each other so 
widely in their opinions is that of two hypotheses that 
equally well explain the facts, one seems true to one, and 
the other to another. A dozen men on a jury listen to the 
same evidence, and part of them base one conclusion upon
-P-A-G-E-351
342 REASONING. 
it, and the rest of them another. This is only another way 
of saying that one hypothesis that explains the facts seems 
probable to a part of them, and another to the rest of them. 
Ido not believe that a more definite account of this assump- 
tion can be given than the following: We are naturally 
disposed to believe any hypothesis that does not seem im- 
probable in itself, which explains facts for which we have, 
apart from it, no explanation. 
Law of Parsimony. — It is evident that of two hypoth- 
eses, one which assumes a cause certainly known to exist, 
to account for the facts, and one which assumes an un- 
known cause, the former is the more reasonable. That is 
the reason why we are bound to account for the actions of 
animals by means of. the hypothesis of mechanical associa- 
tion, ¢f we can. Animals certainly do associate things 
mechanically. If, then, we can explain their actions by 
means of laws known to be in operation, we have no right 
to assume any other. That is the meaning of the law 
of Parsimony: Causes must not ‘be multiplied beyond 
necessity.   
Need of Care in Making Inductions. — Since we can 
not rid our inductions of an element of uncertainty, no 
matter how cautiously and carefully we frame them, it is 
evident that, unless we make them as cautiously and as 
carefully as we can, they are likely to have very little 
value. ‘I do not like Jews,” says one. Get him to tell 
you why, and you will find that the reason is that he has 
known two or three Jews who were not pleasant persons. 
“It does not do boys any good to go to college,” says 
another. “John Jones went to college, and he does not
-P-A-G-E-352
NEED OF CARE IN MAKING INDUCTIONS, 343 
know any more than Will Smith does” —as though an 
examination of the case of John Jones entitled on& to an 
opinion of the whole class of students that attend college. 
“TI do not like people with little noses,” says a third; 
“they are always mean and stingy.” The foundation for 
which is that he has seen one or two people with little 
noses who were stingy. Doubtless the great majority of 
the popular superstitions, “Thirteen is an unlucky num- 
ber,” “Bad luck to begin anything on Friday,” etc., origi- 
nated the same way. The best thing we can do to guard 
our pupils against such inductions is so constantly to call 
their attention to the necessity of founding their beliefs 
upon a wide basis of facts that they may get a realization 
of the danger of doing anything else. 
How to Impress this upon Pupils. ~— Of course, the 
first condition of doing this successfully is that you have a 
vivid appreciation of the dangers of such inductions your: 
self.. If you have such an appreciation, by encouraging 
them to express their opinions upon the various matters 
that come up, you can do something to develop such an 
appreciation in them. And when you are trying to develop 
it, first of all in your own mind, and then in the minds of 
your pupils, remember that the greatest foe of progress is 
Ignorance, and that the strongest friends of Ignorance 
are the dogmatism and prejudice to which careless and 
slovenly reasoning naturally give birth. 
We have seen that when we appeal to a general pro- 
position to prove our conclusion, the reasoning is called 
deductive; when we appeal to particular facts, inductive. 
When we try to prove one fact by appealing to another 
which is only valid to prove the one fact we have inferred,
-P-A-G-E-353
344 REASONING. 
so far as it has any validity, we are said to reason by 
analogy. 
Argument from Analogy. — Argument from analogy is 
defined by Jevons as “direct inductive inference from one 
fact to any similar fact.” The same author gives the fol- 
lowing example: “Thus the planet Mars possesses an 
atmosphere, with clouds and mist closely resembling our 
own; it has seas, distinguished from the land by a greenish 
color, and polar regions covered with snow. The red color 
of the planet seems to be due to the atmosphere, like the 
red color of our sunrises and sunsets. So much is similar 
in the surface of Mars and the surface of the earth, that 
we readily argue there must be inhabitants there as here. 
All that we can certainly say, however, is that ¢#f the cir- 
cumstances be really similar, and similar germs of life 
have been created there as here,’ there must be inhabitants. 
The fact that many circumstances are similar, increases 
the probability. But between the earth and the sun, the 
analogy is of a much fainter character. We speak, indeed, 
of the sun’s atmosphere being subject to storms and filled 
with clouds, but these clouds are heated probably beyond 
the temperature of our hottest furnaces; if they produce 
tain, it must resemble’ melted iron; and the sun-spots are 
perturbations of so tremendous a size and character that 
the earth, together with half a dozen of the other planets, 
could readily be swallowed up in one of them. It is plain, 
then, that there is little or no analogy between the sun and 
the earth, and we can, therefore, with difficulty form a 
conception of anything going on in a sun or a star.” 
1 Ttalics are mine,
-P-A-G-E-354
QUESTIONS. : 345 
Uncertainty of it.— This kind of reasoning is more 
uncertain than inductive reasoning. Jevors speaks of the 
similarity between so many circumstances in the case of 
Mars and the earth as increasing the probability that the 
former is inhabited because the latter is, and at the same 
time says that “all we can certainly say is, that if the cir- 
cumstances be really similar, and similar germs of life 
have been created there as here, there must be inhab- 
itants.” Need I say that in the very nature of the case 
we neither know nor can know anything about whether 
“similar germs of life have been created there as here,” 
and that.our knowledge of the extent to which circum- | 
stances are similar is so limited that any talk of probability 
is absolutely without foundation? All that the facts war- 
rant us in saying is, that for aught we know Mars may be 
inhabited, but he who claims to be able to say that it 
probably is, lays claim to a larger amount-of knowledge 
than falls to the lot of mortals.

APPERCEPTION,

of intellectual activity. If we pass them in rapid review 
before us, we shall see that in all of them the mind is 
discriminating or noting differences, and assimilating or 
noting resemblances. ‘ 
Assimilation and Discrimination in Sensation.— What 
is it to know a Sensation? It is to discriminate or mentally 
separate it from all other sensations. A child has many 
sensations which it does not know; many sensations which 
it confuses with other sensations. But a sensation con- 
fused with other sensations is a sensation put in the wrong 
class —precisely as, if one were sorting out “ribbons of 
different colors, the confusing of purple with blue would 
lead to the mixing of these two kinds of ribbons. 
In Perception. — So likewise in perception. The first 
act of the mind in perceiving is to separate mentally the 
thing perceived ‘from everything else. You remember 
that, in the lessons on Attention, we saw that what we 
perceive depends upon what we attend to. The mind in 
attention simply singles out the thing attended to from 
346
-P-A-G-E-356
IN MEMORY. 347 
everything else, and that is discrimination. A dog may 
stand before you, but if, through preoccupation or from 
any other cause, you do not discriminate it from the objects 
about it, you do not know it. Discrimination, however, is 
not all that is essential to knowledge. Asa matter of fact, 
when we discriminate we usually know, because assimila- 
tion, or the act of putting a thing discriminated into a 
class, usually follows so closely upon the act of discrimina- 
tion that the two seem to be identical. But they are not. 
To pick a piece of blue ribbon out of a scrap bag is one 
thing; to put it in a box with other blue ribbons is an 
entirely different thing. A child, seeing a dog, may dis- 
criminate it from all other objects, but until he perceives 
its resemblance to something else, until he assimilates it, 
he does not know it. 
In Memory. — So likewise with memory. What is it 
to have a perfect recollection of any event? It is to have 
a definite knowledge both of the event and of the time 
when it happened. If the event is indistinct, it is not 
perfectly remembered, and its indistinctness is due to 
imperfect discrimination and assimilation. If we are in 
any doubt as to the time, it is because we do not perfectly 
discriminate it from other times, and do not perfectly 
assimilate it to other times. The event happened, say, at 
eleven o’clock yesterday, but I am uncertain whether it 
was eleven or twelve, or whether it happened yesterday or 
the day before—that is, I do not discriminate the hour 
and the day when it happened from all others. 
Possibly you think that in this latter case there is no 
assimilation. Inasmuch as in any one place there is but 
one point of time known as eleven o'clock, April 26, 1890,
-P-A-G-E-357
348 APPERCEPTION. 
the question may be asked as to how it is possible for 
assimilation of such a fact to take place. The question 
can be readily answered if we bear in mind that the state 
of mind corresponding to the fact “eleven o’clock yester- 
day” is a complex concept. Before a child can know 
what is meant by “eleven o’clock yesterday,” he must 
know the meaning of “yesterday” and “eleven o'clock,” 
and this is possible only by discrimination and assimilation. 
But with the concepts of these two facts as elements, all 
that is necessary to the formation of the complex concept 
expressed by the phrase “eleven o’clock yesterday” is a 
synthesis of the two through the exercise of the construc- 
tive imagination. The product of constructive imagination 
is, of course, an image; but as we can take the image of 
red color to illustrate the concept color, so we can take 
any image to illustrate the corresponding concept. 
In Conception. — We have seen that the three processes 
involved in conception are comparison — putting the atten- 
‘tion on two or more objects at the same time, discriminating 
them from all other objects; abstraction — withdrawing 
the attention from their unlike qualities and fixing it upon 
their resemblances, assimilating them; and generalization 
-— extending their name to all other objects having similar 
qualities —a further act of assimilation. 
In order to judge, wé must know the subject and predi- 
cate; and to do this, we must discriminate and assimilate 
them. I cah not judge that oak. trees lose their leaves in 
autumn unless I know what oak trees are, and what is 
meant by “losing their leaves.in autumn.” But to know 
oak trees, I must discriminate them from all other trees, 
and assimilate them to each other. The state of mind 
t
-P-A-G-E-358
IN REASONING. 349 
corresponding to the fact “losing their leaves in autumn” 
is a complex concept; and to know its ‘elements, as we 
have seen, we must assimilate and discriminate them, 
In Reasoning. — The same is true of reasoning. When 
Lsay that John is a mortal, since he is a man and all men 
are mortal, my conclusion is the result of two acts of 
assimilation — the assimilation of John to the class men, 
and of these to the class mortals. : 
When I say that, since this and that. and the other 
insupported body have fallen, therefore all unsupported 
bodies will, I have perceived, in the first place, the resem- 
blance between the unsupported bodies I have seen —I 
have assimilated them; and, in the second place, I have 
assimilated them to all other unsupported bodies. 
Why so Many Kinds of Assimilation and Discrimina- 
tion? — Since all knowing consists to so great an extent of 
discrimination and assimilation, how can there be so many 
different kinds of knowing? Because there are so many 
different facts to be discriminated and assimilated. The 
discrimination and assimilation of siagle sensations leads 
to the knowledge of sensations; of groups of sensations to 
the perception of objects which result in percepts; of per- 
cepts, to concepts ; of concepts, to judgments, of judgments, 
to conclusions. 
But does not this answer leave the really difficult point 
unexplained? Granting that there are different kinds of 
facts to be discriminated and assimilated, it is easy to see 
that they would issue in different products. But how is 
it that there are different kinds of facts? That is the 
teally difficult question. /
-P-A-G-E-359
350 APPERCEPTION, 
' How do Psychical Facts Come to Be? —It may seem 
that to ask that question is like asking why there are so 
many different kinds of facts to be known in the universe. 
But it is not. Granted that there are things without, how 
do we come to know them? How does that which is there 
somehow get to be represented ere in my mind? Granted 
also that I have lived — have laughed and wept and hoped 
and feared — have played a part as a conscious being in 
this strange world. But the past is gone, and with it its 
experiences. How is it that I am able to recollect them? 
How is it that that which was there and then somehow 
gets to be represented here and xow in my mind? Granted 
also that there are real relations existing between real 
things, how am I able to assert them? That which gets 
into my mind is mental. How is the merely mental 
transformed into the nonenfental, the subjective into the 
objective ? 
These, you know, are some of the questions we have 
‘been trying to answer, and they help us to realize what we 
are constantly in danger of forgetting — that our science, 
instead of having merely to discover the laws that govern 
ready-made facts, is to a large extent a science of pro- 
cesses — a science that has to discover how its facts come 
to be. 
Sensations. —- How, then, do the facts that we know as 
sensations come to exist? In the way already described — 
characterless, indefinite, and undifferentiated experiences, 
but with latent likenesses and differences, begin to exist. 
How these were transformed into definite sensations has 
already been explained. Here we have only to note that 
this transformation was the mind’s own work; that what
-P-A-G-E-360
PERCEPTS. 351 
we call a sensation is, in a sense, the product of the mind’s 
own activity —— that this activity converted latent likenesses 
and differences into a consciousness of likeness and dif- 
ference between definite sensations. 
Percepts. — How do percepts come to exist? By the 
mind’s own activity. Sensations existing with certain 
spatial meanings come to be known as having those mean- 
ings. Through the native power of the mind to interpret 
the brogue of its sensations, to understand the meaning of 
their local signs, the mind arranges its sensations in space. 
and the result is a percept. 
Recollections. — How do recollections of past ex- 
periences come to exist? Again by the mind’s own 
activity. Our experiences succeed each other in time. 
That we know that they do results from the activity of our 
‘minds; the mind retrojects some of its images’ into the 
past through its interpretation of their temporal signs, 
precisely as it projects some of its sensations into space 
through its interpretation of their local signs. 
  Judgments. — How do judgments come to exist? 
Through the mind’s power to apprehend the various rela- 
tions of reality. Day precedes night. The mind appre- 
hends it, and the result is a judgment. Hamilton origi- 
nated the financial policy of the Federalist party. The 
mind apprehends it, and the result is a judgment. Judg- 
ments are the products of the mind’s power to apprehend 
the relations of reality. 
Tn each of these cases we have to note that it was no 
mere differentiation and classification of ready-made facts
-P-A-G-E-361
352 APPERCEPTION. 
that brought about the result. The mind makes its sen. 
sations, makes its percepts, makes its concepts, makes its 
judgments, and so makes possible their discrimination and 
ssimilation. . 
Relation of Attention to these Mental Activities. — 
We know also the condition of these various activities. 
But it is only a condition. The activity of attention is no 
more to be confused with what results from it than light 
is to be confused with seeing. The best eye can not see 
in the dark, and the finest mind can not elaborate its pro- 
ducts without attention; but light is not seeing, and atten- 
tion is not the fact-making activity of the mind. 
Apperception Defined. — We see also in what this 
activity consists. It is a relating activity — in sensation, 
bringing characterless experiences into relations of like 
ness and: difference; in perception, combining sensations 
into relations of space; in memory, combining the various 
elements of experience into relations of time; in concep- 
tion, combining percepts into relations of likeness; in 
judgment, combining percepts and’ concepts into the 
various relations of reality apprehended by the mind. If, 
then, we adopt the name usually applied to this activity 
and call it apperception, we see that apperception is that 
combining activity of the mind that brings order and 
harmony into our mental life by transforming the con- 
sciousness ao related facts “into the consciousness of 
relations.” 
Apperception, then — of which, indeed, discrimination 
and assimilation are modes—jis the most fundamental

form of mental activity. It makes sensations, and then, 
in the form of discrimination, separates those that are un- 
like and assimilates those that are alike; it discovers the 
space relations of sensations, transforms them into attri- 
butes of bodies, and then discriminates the objects so 
perceived that are unlike, and assimilates those that are 
alike; it discerns the time relations of mental facts, and 
transforms a succession of experiences into a conscious- 
ness of succession; it combines percepts into concepts, 
percepts and concepts into judgments, judgments into 
conclusions,

LESSON XXXIX. 
APPERCEPTION. 
(Continued. 
In the last lesson we saw that perception, memory, | 
imagination, conception, judging, and reasoning are pro- 
cesses of discrimination and assimilation, exercised on dif- 
ferent materials, and that these different materials are 
themselves products of a more fundamental mode of 
mental activity, of which discrimination and assimilation 
are forms. 
How can Knowledge Best be Imparted ? — This being 
so, the question, How can I impart knowledge most 
clearly ? may be put in another form. From the point of 
view we have now reached, we are able to see that the 
question is, How can I supply the conditions of appercep- 
tion? or, to put it more definitely, though not so accurately, 
How can IJ enable my pupils to discriminate and assimilate 
most perfectly ? 
This activity of apperception in any of its forms consésts 
in the establishment of relation. If, then, a new fact is 
to be apperceived, it must be brought into relations with 
old facts. The unknown must be related to the known. 
Now, in order that this may take place —in order that 
this relation may be established —it is not enough that 
354
-P-A-G-E-364
HOW CAN KNOWLEDGE BE IMPARTED? 355 
the mind have in the storehouse of memory concepts to 
which the known may beerelated ; these concepts must be 
brought out; and the more completely the whole of one’s 
past experience is ransacked for related concepts, the more 
perfect will be the apperception or assimilation. 
We can easily illustrate the truth of this by appealing 
‘to our own experiences. Sometimes we read books to 
“inform our minds,” or “to get general information”; 
sometimes to get definite answers to definite questions. 
Which do you find the more profitable reading? The last, 
I am sure; and the reason is that your whole knowledge 
of the subject to which your question relates is brought to 
bear on everything you find related to it. Your “apper- 
ceiving conceptions ... stand, like armed soldiers, within 
the strongholds of consciousness, ready to pounce upon” 
everything they can bring within their grasp. Read the 
same book with no question in mind, and those apperceiv- 
ing conceptions are like soldiers asleep, who let their enemy 
go by them undisturbed. You get illustrations of the same 
truth when you re-read a book after a considerable interval. 
If the book is thoughtful — worth re-reading — you are 
almost sure to find some suggestive or striking observation 
that escaped your notice the first time. I have read 
Bagehot’s Physics and Politics many times, but I do not 
remember that my attention was ever attracted to the para- 
graph quoted some pages back until I read it a couple of 
weeks ago. When I read it before, I had “no receptivity” 
for it, either because I had no related concepts in my 
mind, or because they were in the background of con- 
sciousness, and therefore, like soldiers asleep, unservice- 
able. But when I read it two weeks ago, my attention 
had been attracted to the subject of the paragraph by my 
~~ te : ‘
-P-A-G-E-365
356 APPERCEPTION, 
own observations, and so my mind pounced upon it with 
great eagerness. 
When you select a subject for an essay that interests 
you very much, three or four months before the time you 
expect to write it, your experience gives you illustrations 
of the same truth. You scarcely read a singlé newspaper, 
or a magazine article, or a novel, that does not suggest 
some idea on your subject. You suddenly become aware 
that there is a universe of thought as well as a material 
universe, and you find your subject “opening out” into it 
in every direction. Without that subject in mind, your 
reading would have had no such result ; your apperceiving 
conceptions would have been asleep; their natural prey 
would have escaped. 
Preparation. — These illustrations enable us to realize 
that the Herbartians are right when they say that “the 
Jirst great function of the teacher is to prepare the way 
Sor the rapid and efficient assimilation of that knowledge 
which the study hour or the recitation period is to fur- 
nish,” and that this function consists in causing’“to appear 
in the consciousness” of the pupil “those interpreting 
ideas” that enable him to assimilate what is presented 
to him." 
Before the “presentation,” then, of the matter of the 
lesson, the pupil’s mind should be prepared for it. We 
have seen already how much the value of our reading is 
increased when we read to get a definite answer to a defi- 
nite question. Let us bear this in mind when we are 
preparing the minds of our pupils for the apperception of 
1 De Garmo’s Essentials of Method, p. 32.
-P-A-G-E-366
PRESENTATION. 357 
concepts. Let us put a definite question before them 
which it is the aim of the lesson to answer. 
When we have stated clearly the object of the lesson, 
we can help him still further by helping him to array in 
consciousness his apperceiving conceptions, so that he will 
be most fully prepared to accomplish the work. We see 
the connection between this lesson and some preceding 
lesson. We should recall the previous lesson to his mind ; 
we should help him to bring out of the storehouse of his 
memory everything that bears on the lesson. We can, of 
course, do this most successfully by asking questions, 
because in this way we secure from him the greatest 
amount of mental activity." 
Presentation. — When in such ways the mind of the 
pupil is prepared for the efficient assimilation of the lesson, 
the matter of the lesson should be presented — the teacher, 
of course, requiring as much of this to be done by the 
pupil as possible. This subject of presentation has already 
béen discussed in connection with the Objective Method. 
Presentation is nothing but a process of getting “reality” 
before the mind of the pupil. 
Play of the Mind. — But we have seen that the “play 
of the mind” there spoken of is, for the most part, a form 
of apperception or assimilation. If we bear this in mind, 
we can better supply the conditions for it by bringing his 
mind into contact with those phases of the reality in ques- 
tion that present the most salient features for the activity 
of assimilation. 
1 See on this whole subject the book already cited,
-P-A-G-E-367
358 APPERCEPTION. 
Pedagogical Principle. — To this end, it will be useful 
for us to remember the following principle: “Objects and 
wholes of any kind are more easily discriminated and 
assimilated — apperceived in general — than qualities 
and parts.’ The ground of it is evident. Objects and 
wholes of any kind differ from each other in more marked 
and striking, ways than qualities and parts, and conse- 
quently can be more easily discriminated. Since they 
also resemble each other in a greater number of particu- 
lars, they can be more easily assimilated. 
Proof. — You can prove its truth by appealing to your 
own experience. Which do you recognize more easily and 
certainly — your friends as wholes, or their individual 
features? Try to describe the features of your most inti- 
mate friends in their absence, and you will see. You will 
often find yourself ludicrously uncertain as to the shape of 
the nose, the color of the eyes and hair, to say nothing of 
less prominent features. All of us likewise recognize a 
rose when we see it, but it requires the training of the 
botanist to point out the qualities which distinguish it from 
all other flowers. 
Assuming the truth of this principle, it is evident that 
we can best assist our pupils to discriminate and assimilate 
by presenting to them wholes and objects before parts and 
qualities. 
Material Wholes and Thought Wholes.—We must 
not limit the application of this principle to material 
objects and material wholes. It applies to thought wholes 
as.well. Indeed, strictly speaking, all wholes are thought 
wholes — wholes made by thought, wholes that are wholes
-P-A-G-E-368
THOUGHT WHOLES IN ARITHMETIC. 359 
because the mind chooses to think of them as such. There 
is absolutely nothing in existence except the universe 
which we may not think of as a part if we choose, and 
absolutely nothing that we can not think of as a whole. 
The universe, including everything, can not be thought of 
as a part of anything else. Apart from that, it is thénk- 
ing, and thinking only, which makes a thing a part or 
a whole. 
Thought Wholes in Arithmetic. — Many arithmeticians 
do not kéep this fact in mind. A fraction is often defined 
as one or more of the equal parts of a unit, as though units 
were things of fixed and unchangeable values. I divide 
an apple into four equal parts, and you ask me if one of 
these equal parts is a fourth. Ido not know how to answer 
the question, or rather the question does not admit of an 
answer until it is made more definite. If you ask me what 
I call one of the parts in relation te the other three, I 
answer, a unit. It is ove in relation to the other three, 
two in relation to eighths, four in relation to sixteenths, 
and one-fourth in relation to the apple. The apple itself 
is one-fourth when considered in relation to a group of 
four apples, one-eighth in relation to a group of eight 
apples, and soon. As the mind decides in what relations 
it will consider things, it is clear that all wholes, as such, 
are products of the mind. The reason why certain wholes, 
as apples, oranges, horses, dogs, etc., are thought of as 
wholes, in a special sense, is that the purposes of life and 
their relation to each other make it natural for the mind 
to consider them as such. If this is clear, we may say 
that a whole is anything, mental or material, that the mind 
chooses to regard as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-369
360 APPERCEPTION. 
In History. — Thus we may think of the life and public 
services of Alexander Hamilton as wholes. And, in ac- 
cordance with the principle we have been discussing, the 
student will be best assisted in getting clear ideas of the 
life of that great man by having his attention called to its 
broad general characteristics first, before these are modified 
and qualified. If the student learns that Hamilton was 
first a Tory, then a Democrat, and finally a believer in a 
strongly centralized aristocratic republic, the broad out- 
lines of Hamilton’s political creed lie before him. The 
qualifications and specific description of these character- 
izations will put before him the changes in and final 
character of Hamilton’s political creed with the utmost 
definiteness. So if your object is to give your class a 
clear idea of Hamilton’s public services, first give them 
a clear idea of the great work of his life —the strengthen- 
ing and centralizing of the general government; then they 
areready for the details— the measures and influences by 
which these ends were reached.* 
From the Known to the Unknown. — That we must 
proceed from the known to the unknown is another well- 
established rule in Pedagogy. It is hardly necessary to 
say that it is based on the fact that all knowing consists 
to so great an extent in discriminating and assimilating. 
When I learn a new fact — till then, of course, unknown 
— I put it in a class of already known facts. 
From the Simple to the Complex. — That we must 
proceed from the simple to the complex, from the indefinite 
to the definite, from the unqualified to the qualified, is 
1 See on this subject De Garmo on Method-wholes, 
yy
-P-A-G-E-370
FROM THE SIMPLE TO THE COMPLEX. 361 
another well-established pedagogical rule. What is its 
psychological basis? Plainly that a simple, indefinite, or 
unqualified fact or statement is more easily discriminated 
and assimilated than a complex, definite, or qualified fact 
' or statement. If you are teaching a child the form of the 
outlines of South America, you will succeed best by ignor- 
ing its irregularities in the beginning. With the map 
before him, make him conscious of its general resemblance 
to a triangle or a ham of meat, or other familiar object, 
before you try to teach him how it differs in shape from 
them. If in such ways you fix the general outline in his 
mind before advancing to the details, you will impart clear 
ideas. And why? Because you are working in harmony 
with the laws of his mind. 
There is a stronger resemblance between the outline of 
South America and a triangle than there is between it 
and any other simple figure, and if the child has a familiar 
knowledge of a triangle, he assimilates the general shape 
of South America as soon as his attention is called to it.” 
Indeed, so far as thought is concerned, this case comes 
under the general principle already spoken of — wholes 
and objects are more easily discriminated and assimilated 
than parts and qualities. To shought, South America has 
the, shape of a triangle-—a whole — qualified by certain 
irregularities." In other words, just as the mind grasps a 
whole before it does the parts, so it grasps the triangle 
in South America before it does the deviations from a 
triangle. So likewise of the unqualified or indefinite in 
relation to the qualified or definite. In relation to thought, 
the unqualified and indefinite are wholes, first known as 
such before they are qualified and made definite, and the 
qualities are parts.
-P-A-G-E-371
362 APPERCEPTION. 
Application. — When we have put our pupil in posses. 
sion of a concept, or definition, or induction, or maxim — 
we should, as the Herbartians insist, help him to vitalize 
his knowledge by helping him to apply itt In teaching 
history, for example, we are constantly running upon some * 
truth about human nature, or upon some law of economics 
or politics. To vitalize this truth, the pupil must be helped 
to see its relation to everything to which it applies within 
the range of his knowledge and experience. 
Here we can see the educational value of “reviews” — 
it is to give to the student’s knowledge that familiarity 
that makes it possible for him to relate it properly to new 
knowledge, and to use it in acquiring new knowledge. 
Reviews. — Ordinary usage tends to promulgate the 
idea that reviews are useful only to fix things in the mind 
of the student in order that he can tell them. If they are 
only good for that, they are hardly good for anything, 
‘There are three stages of knowing. In the first, knowl- 
edge is merely implicit; the student can not express what 
he knows. Such knowledge is useful as a foundation for 
something better; but if it never leaves that stage, it is 
11 can not agree with Dr. De Garmo and the Herbartians that this last 
stage or step always forms a part of a correct method. He holds that “ (1) 
the apperception of new facts in preparation and presentation ; (2) the 
transition from individual to general notions, whether the latter appear as 
definitions, rules, principles, or moral maxims; and (3) the application of 
these general truths to concrete facts, iz. the return from universals to 
particulars,” are the three “ essential stages of a correct method.” I think 
that he makes this second step much too definite, as is evident from what 
Thave said about “the play of the mind about the reality” in discussing 
the Objective Method. In some cases, as we have seen, “the play of the 
mind” is simply the appreciation of what is beautiful. How can such 
appreciation be applied?

almost worthless. In the second, it has become explicit ; 
the student can tell what he knows, but he does not know 
it fluently enough, so to speak, to use it in thinking. In 
the third, the student not only knows, but knows so well 
that he can use his knowledge in thinking; he can use it 
in acquiring, and also in illustrating, new knowledge. Such 
knowledge is thoroughly assimilated; it has become a part, 
as it were, of the warp and woof, the flesh and bone and 
blood of his mind. To develop knowledge into that shape 
is the great function of reviews.

LESSON XL. 
NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT. 
Summary of the Preceding Chapter. We have now 
completed our survey of the so-called intellectual faculties. 
The last chapter has enabled us to see that this division of 
the mind into faculties is not a fundamental division — 
that, however convenient it may be to speak of perception, 
memory, imagination, conception, and reasoning as though 
they were distinct and separate powers of the mind, all of 
them are mere modes of apperception. 
What the Training of the Faculties of the Mind 
Means.—-In connection with the discussion of each of 
these modes of apperception, or faculties, as we may, to 
save circumlocution, continue to call them, we have con- 
sidered the subject of their training. At this point, we 
may profitably consider the question as to what the train- 
ing of these faculties means. Does the training of the 
faculty of observation mean the development of the power 
of observation in general? In other words, does the 
student who increases his power of observation by observ- 
ing plants, increase his powers to the same extent — or 
even at all-—to observe the facts of his mind? Does the 
student who cultivates his memory by the study of history 
364
-P-A-G-E-374
SYMMETRICAL DEVELOPMENT. 365 
——-his historical memory, we may call it—at the same 
time cultivate his geological or botanical memory? Does 
the student who cultivates his geographical imagination at 
the same time cultivate his mathematical imagination ? 
Does the student who trains his reasoning power through 
_ the study of mathematics at the same time train it for the 
| study of chemistry? In a word, are we to suppose that 
the exercise of our powers upon any subject matter trains 
them to an equal extent to deal with any other subject 
_ matter? 
| 
| Symmetrical Development. — Students familiar with 
{ pedagogical literature have already seen that I am inquir- 
ing into the validity of a time-honored conception —the 
conception of symmetrical development. The ordinary con- 
ception of education is that it consists in symmetrical 
development, and by symmetrical development popular 
thought supposes such a development of the various powers 
of the mind as corresponds to their worth in the mental 
q life. As reasoning is of more value than memory, it should 
receive more cultivation, but the cultivation which each of 
them receives is a cultivation good for any subject matter 
whatever. This is the conception the truth of which I am 
calling in question. , 
Huzley on Education. We meet this conception in 
so cClear-headed a thinker as the late Professor Huxley. 
« That man,” he says, “I think, has had a liberal education 
4 who has been so trained in his youth that his body is the 
ready servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure 
all the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of ; whose 
intellect is a clear, cold logic-engine, with all its parts of
-P-A-G-E-375
366 NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT. 
equal strength, and in smooth working order ; ready, like 
" a steam-engine, to be turned to any kind of work, and spin 
the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; 
whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the great and 
fundamental truths of nature, and of the laws of her opera- 
tions; one who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire, 
but whose passions are trained to come to heal by a vig- 
orous will, the servant of a tender conscience; who has 
learned to love all beauty, whether of nature or art; to 
hate all vileness, and to respect others as himself.” 
Is Huxley’s Opinion True? —- Are there any men with 
intellects of this description ready, like a steam-engine, 
to be turned to any kind of work, ready to observe and 
remember any classes of facts, to imagine any phases of 
reality, to reason upon any subject with equal facility? 
With the possible exception of a few universal geniuses 
like Aristotle, Shakespeare, and Goethe, have there been 
any men capable of spinning the gossamers as well as of 
forging the anchors of the mind? If not, it is certainly a 
legitimate inquiry whether, in trying to reach an inherently 
impossible ideal, we are not losing valuable attainable 
goods. 
I believe that the exercise of our powers upon any class 
of facts does not train them to the same extent for exercise 
upon any other class of facts; that you can say of the 
same man that he is a good observer and a bad observer, 
that he has a good memory and a bad memory, that he has 
great imaginative power and poor imaginative power, that 
he is a good reasoner and a poor reasoner, according as 
you have in view one subject matter or another upon which 
his powers are to be exercised.
-P-A-G-E-376
PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY. 367 
Suggestions of Physiological Psychology.—I call your 
attention to the support which this proposition receives 
from Physiological Psychology. In our study of the brain 
we have learned that the functions of the cerebrum are 
to some extent localized, that the part of the cerebrum 
especially active in occasioning sensations of color is not 
the part especially active in connection with sensations of 
smell, and so on. What good reason, then, is there for 
supposing that a good observer of the colors of objects 
will be a good observer of sounds, or that exercise in one 
kind of observation has the same effect upon the mind as 
another? On the contrary, such a view of the facts sug- 
gests that we ought to speak of the mind’s powers of 
observation, not power, precisely as we have seen that we 
ought to speak of the memories, rather than of the memory, 
of the mind. 
Conclusions Drawn from Experience in Case of Obser- 
vation.-— When we study the effects of exercise in observa- 
tion upon our minds and those of the people we know, we 
find the suggestions of Physiological Psychology abundantly 
confirmed. The sailor who can tell at a glance what line 
a steamship belongs to, and can detect land where you can 
not see anything, is a very poor observer when you get 
him on land; the jeweler who can tell with ease whether 
a stone is a genuine diamond, but who has no skill in 
distinguishing the qualities of silks; the wool-buyer who 
can tell the quality of wool from the way it feels, but who 
can not distinguish one quality of tea from another; the 
tea-taster who can discriminate the qualities of different 
teas with almost unerring accuracy, but who can scarcely 
distinguish one horse from another—are cases in point.
-P-A-G-E-377
368 NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT. 
The expression, Such and such a man is a good observer, 
is always elliptical. It means that he is a good observer of 
certain classes of facts. 
Memory. — We have already seen that the same is true 
of memory. We recall how Dr. Harris cultivated his 
memory for dates, and then for xames—the cultivation 
of the one kind of memory was not the cultivation of the 
other. Every one knows that the man in whose memory 
certain kinds of facts “stick,” apparently without effort 
upon his part, may remember facts in another department 
of thought only with great difficulty. The student who 
can not remember Latin and Greek forms may carry mul- 
titudes of chemical facts in his mind without difficulty, as 
one who can not remember mathematical formulas may 
remember psychological or historical facts with ease. -How 
easily the story-teller remembers long-winded stories, or 
the practiced chess-player complicated positions on the 
chess-board, but it does not follow that either of them has 
a good memory for anything else. 
Imagination. We have seen that the same is true 
of the imagination. We remember that not only is it not 
true that the sort of training which the physicist gives his 
imagination in the study of his subject does not train 
his imagination to realize the facts of Psychology, but 
that in some respects such a training is a positive dis- 
qualification for it. Professor James reports an incident 
which illustrates in a very vivid way the effect of the study 
of biology on the psychological imagination. “I have heard 
a most intelligent biologist say : ‘It is high time for scien- 
tific men to protest against the recognition of any such
-P-A-G-E-378
REASONING. _ 369 
thing as consciousness in a scientific investigation.’” The 
imagination of this biologist was so disqualified by his 
studies for apprehending the realities of consciousness 
that it seemed absurd to him to take any account of them 
at all! Each subject has its appropriate imagination, and 
the cultivation of the imagination by exercising it upon 
one subject matter is not the cultivation it would receive 
by exercising it upon another. Galton found that people 
in general society have as a rule much greater power to 
imagine in definite and vivid ways the things and events 
of ordinary life than men of science. The reason is that 
men of science are engaged for the most part in dealing 
with the images of symbols, and they therefore lose the 
| power to form definite and clear-cut images of things. 
| Reasoning. — The same is true of reasoning. Every 
} teacher knows how common it is to meet students who 
} excel in one study, but who are below mediocrity in another. 
And biography is crowded with examples which show that 
excellence in one field is no warrant for inferring excelience 
' in another. Charles Sumner, excelling as a statesman, but 
' below mediocrity as a mathematician; Darwin, almost 
failing as a student of Latin and Greek, but with powers 
of reasoning in other fields which have placed him in the 
* very front of the naturalists of the world; Sir William 
. Hamilton, with powers as a metaphysician of the highest 
{ order of excellence, but with little capacity for mathematics 
—are cases in point. One may say indeed that one of 
3 the great characteristics of the nineteenth century is to 
4 emphasize more and more the value of expert knowledge. 
4 Who cares for a mathematician’s opinion about currency, 
or for an economist’s opinion about mathematics? Who
-P-A-G-E-379
379 NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT. 
wishes to know what a clergyman thinks about geology, 
or what a geologist thinks about theology? President 
Eliot well says: “Confidence in experts, and willingness 
to employ them and abide by their decisions, ‘are among 
the best signs of intelligence in an educated. individual or 
an educated community.” The reason is not only that 
expert knowledge is essential, but expert reasoning. In 
acquiring the knowledge of his specialty, the expert has 
acquired facility to reason upon it so that he is as much 
superior to the layman in a certain kind of reasoning 
capacity as he is in the possession of a certain kind of 
knowledge. 
Truth Emphasized by the Notion of Symmetrical 
Development. — We seem justified in concluding, then, 
that there is no such thing as a universal training of per- 
ception, memory, imagination, reasoning. The notion of 
symmetrical development has played its part upon the 
educational stage. It is time for the curtain to drop upon 
it forever. That part has undoubtedly been useful. The 
idea of symmetrical development has helped us to remem- 
ber that man is more than intellect — that a man whose 
intellect alone is developed has a poor education, no matter 
how well developed his intellect may be, as a man with 
a good deal of taste in some directions is likely to be a 
drivelling sentimentalist without a proper training of his 
intellect. A conception which has helped to keep such 
facts before our minds has rendered important service. 
It has also emphasized the fact that teachers have so 
much difficulty in remembering that the proper training 
of the intellect consists in something more than imparting 
knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-380
ERRORS SUGGESTED. . 371 
  
Errors Suggested by it. — But it has also done a good 
deal of harm, Few educational experts to-day doubt that 
we require our pupils to study arithmetic at least twice as 
long as we ought. Why do we do it? Because of the 
notion of symmétrical development. With the idea that 
the study of arithmetic is especially adapted to train the 
reasoning power, we put our pupils at it when they start 
to school, and keep them at it until they enter the high 
school, and sometimes even longer. The same reasoning 
is used to justify the vicious extent to which our pupils 
are required to study technical grammar. I can not 
take time to point out the mischief which this mode of 
reasoning has wrought in high schools and colleges —~ to 
show the absurdity, for example, of requiring American 
_ citizens to study Latin, and not requiring them to study 
American history ; of requiring them to study Greek, and 
not requiring them to study political economy; of requir- 
| ing them to study higher mathematics, and not requiring 
| them to study municipal government. Accept the theory 
that the training of the reasoning power upon one subject 
is to an equal extent a training of it to deal with any other 
subject —and such requirements are wise. Accept the 
theory that we acquire the capacity to reason upon any 
| subject matter by actually reasoning upon that subject 
matter —- and such requirements are absurd. 
; If, then, we must abandon the idea of symmetrical 
| development as the criterion by which we are to be guided 
in the determining of courses of study, what shall be our 
j guiding principle? This question I will try to answer in 
the following lesson.

  LESSON XLI. 
THE END OF EDUCATION. 
Herbartian Conception. — The question as to the crite- 
rion which is to guide us in selecting courses of study is” 
the question as to the end of education. The Herbartians 
tell us that this end is character. Taken in the ordinary 
sense, as the equivalent of moral character, we all know 
that is not true. All of us are acquainted with men of 
character who are not educated. 
Dewey’s Definition of Character. — But I find myself 
obliged to dissent from the view that the end of education 
is the development of character, as character was defined 
at the recent (1897) meeting of the Herbart Society. 
Said Dr. Dewey: “Character means power of social agency, 
organized capacity of social functioning. It means, as 
already suggested, social insight or intelligence, social 
executive power, and social interest or responsiveness.” 
In other words—- according to Dr. Dewey-—that man is 
educated who sees the needs of society, has capacity to 
promote them, and is disposed to do it. 
It Regards Man Simply as a Member of Society. — 
Why not say, That man is educated who sees his own 
; needs,—~using the expression in the most comprehensive 
373
-P-A-G-E-383
374 THE END OF EDUCATION. 
sense, — has capacity to promote them, and is disposed to 
do it? If you say that the two definitions really mean 
the same thing, that they are descriptive of two sides of 
the same fact, I beg to dissent. Dr. Dewey's definition 
regards man as simply a member of society; the defini- 
tion suggested as a substitute regards man as an individ. 
ual, The ancient conception was that the end of man 
was to serve the state, and that the object of education 
was to qualify him for it. As it may seem at first sight 
' _/Abat it makes no difference whether you state the end of 
education in terms that relate to the individual, or in terms 
that relate to society, so it may seem that it could not have 
made any difference whether the old Greeks stated their 
conception of education in terms that related to the state, 
or in tefms that related to the individual, But when we 
find practices which we abhor defended on the principle 
that the individual exists for the state — practices such as 
slavery, the killing of feeble or deformed children, the 
treatment of barbarians as a race essentially inferior to 
the Greeks —it becomes evident that a conception which 
ignores the value and significance of man as an individual 
is not only false, but that it leads to pernicious practical 
consequences, 
Difference between Dewey’s Conception and that of 
the Ancient Greeks. — The difference between Dr. 
Dewey’s conception and that of the ancient Greeks is that 
he puts “society” in the place of the state. As a man, 
according to the ancient Greeks, was nothing but a citizen, 
so, according to Dr. Dewey, he is nothing but a member 
of society. As the individual, according to ‘the ancient 
conception, existed for the state, so, according to Dr.
-P-A-G-E-384
PRACTICAL DEDUCTIONS. 375 4 
Dewey, he exists for the sake of society. “He lives in, for, 
and by society.” And as we have found pernicious prac- 
tical consequences growing out of the notion that man 
was nothing but a citizen, so we shall find pernicious prac- 
tical proposa/s based on the notion that man is nothing but 
a member of society. 
  
Practical Deductions. — “As to methods,” says Dr. 
Dewey, “this principle” —that man exists for society, 
and that the school should be a social community which 
reflects and organizes the fundamental principles of all 
community life— “when applied means that emphasis 
must be upon construction and giving out, rather than 
upon absorption and mere learning. We fail to recognize 
how essentially ixdividualistic” —note the word — “ the 
latter methods are, and how unconsciously, yet certainly 
and effectively, they react into the child’s ways of judging 
and of acting. Imagine forty children all engaged in 
reading the same ‘books, and in preparing and reciting the 
same lessons day after day. Suppose that this constitutes 
by far the larger part of their work, and that they are con- 
tinually judged from the standpoint of what they are able 
to take in in a study hour, and to reproduce in a recitation 
hour. There is next to no opportunity here for any social 
or moral division of labor. There is no opportunity for 
each child to work out something specifically his own, 
which he may contribute to the common stock, while he, 
_ in turn, participates in the productions of others. All are 
| set to do exactly the same work and turn out the same 
results. The social spirit is not cultivated — in fact, in 
1 Italics not in the original,
-P-A-G-E-385
376 THE END OF EDUCATION. ~ 
so far as this method gets in its work, it gradually 
atrophies for lack of use.”* 
Criticism. — Would Dr. Dewey have the forty pupils 
read forty different books in order to make “a moral 
division of labor”? Would he have teachers set their 
pupils to work with a view to the needs of the individual 
pupils, or with a view to the needs of the school as a 
social community? Is the method which lays emphasis 
upon construction less individualistic than the method 
which lays emphasis upon absorption? Is the method which 
lays emphasis upon “giving out” good primarily because 
of its moral effects or because of its effect upon the intel- 
lect of the individual pupil? Is there any moral differ- 
ence between “absorption” and “giving out”? Shall I 
set my pupils a task in which the emphasis is laid upon 
“construction” and “giving out,” not because that sort 
of work is good for them intellectually, but because of its 
supposed moral advantages? Shall I sacrifice the intellec- 
tual good of my pupils for the supposed needs of the 
school as a social community ? 
Test of Good and Bad Methods. — The truth is, if the 
method which lays emphasis upon absorption is a bad 
method, it is not because it is individualistic, but because 
tt ts not individualistic enough. \t deals too superficially 
with the individual. If the method which lays emphasis 
upon construction is a good method, it is because it has 
proper regard for the individual. The method which lays 
emphasis upon absorption is not a bad method because of 
its moral effects; nor is the method which lays emphasis 
1 Third Yearbook of the National Herbart Society, pp. 1§-16.
-P-A-G-E-386
THE PROPER STIMULUS, . 377 
upon construction a good method because of its moral 
excellences. 
The Proper Stimulus. Dr. Dewey says that the 
absorptive method inculcates “positively individualistic 
motives and standards.” ‘Some stimulus will be found 
to keep the child at his studies. At the best this will be 
his affection for his teacher,” etc. Why not interest in 
his work? Does not every teacher know that this is the 
motive to which we must successfully appeal if we are to 
get the best results? “But unfortunately the motive (of 
affection for the teacher) is always mixed with lower 
motives which are distinctly individualistic.” Fear enters 
in, “the fear of losing the approbation of others; fear of 
failure so extreme and sensitive as to be morbid. On the 
other side, emulation and rivalry enter in. Just because 
all are doing the same work, and are judged (both in 
recitation and in examination, with reference to grading 
and to promotion) not from the standpoint of their motives 
or the ends which they are trying to reach, the feeling of 
superiority is unduly appealed to.” 
Dr. Dewey on Promotion.— If the last sentence means 
anything, it means that pupils are to be graded and pro- 
moted not according to their capacity to work, but from 
the standpoint of their motives! A boy is to be promoted 
from one class in arithmetic to another not because he is 
able to do the work in the advanced class, but because of 
the high mora’ purpose that animates him! And how is 
it that Dr. Dewey has failed to see that fear of failure to 
do constructive work may likewise be morbid ; that emula- 
tion and rivalry may as easily step in in connection with
-P-A-G-E-387
378 THE END OF EDUCATION. 
that kind of work as in connection with any other? The 
natural incentive to study is interest in the work done. 
Whoever relies upon any other motive relies upon a com. 
paratively artificial motive. These two propositions, it 
seems to me, are self-evident: (1) When I set a pupil a 
given task, I ought to have in view his entire needs as an 
individual, and not as a member of society simply ; (2) such 
work gives him the best stimulus to work because it -is 
best fitted to arouse his interest. 
Contrast between the Needs of a Pupil as an In- 
dividual, and his Needs as a Member of Society. —— If it 
be said that I am drawing a contrast where none exists, 
the contrast between the needs of the pupil as an individ- 
ual, and his needs as a member of society, I reply in the 
first place that I am simply following Dr. Dewey’s example. 
It is he who suggests that pupils shall be graded and pro- 
moted not according to their capacities — their needs as 
individuals — but according to their needs as members of 
society. In the second place, I am unable to believe that 
the needs of the pupil as an individual, and his needs as a 
member of society are identical. Is not the pleasure which 
a student feels in study one thing, and is not the pleasure 
he experiences as he reflects upon the service which knowl 
edge of the subject will enable him to render to his fellows 
another? Is not the perception of the beauty of a land- 
scape, or a flower, or a picture, or a poem one thing, and 
is not the social use and consequence of that perception a 
different thing? Should we try to help our pupils appre- 
ciate the beauty of nature and art for their own sakes as 
individuals, or for the social uses and consequences of sn~h 
perceptions?
-P-A-G-E-388
THE INDIVIDUAL IS OF SUPREME VALUE. 379 
Tf it were true that the needs of the pupil as an individ. 
ual and his needs as a member of society coincided, I 
should still protest in the interests of right thinking against 
Dr. Dewey’s putting of the question. On that supposition, 
it is surely more rational to say that the ultimate reason 
for the work which we require of pupils is that by doing it 
they promote their own highest ends. For unless the pupil 
has felt the value and significance of his own life as an 
individual, how can he be expected to feel the value and 
significance of the lives of the individuals who compose 
society ? 
The Individual the Thing of Supreme Value. — As I 
conceive it, the Herbartian conception ignores the truth 
which all history has been struggling to teach — that the 
thing of supreme value and worth in this world is the in- 
dividual. What can you do for the individual? is the 
question which we should put to schools, churches, forms 
} of government -— institutions of every description. Not the 
man for the state, as the old Greeks taught, but the state 
for the man; not the man for the Church, as the Middle 
Ages taught, but the Church for the man; not the pupil 
for the school, as Dr. Dewey teaches, but the schooi for 
the pupil. 
If, then, we must reject the notion that the end of 
education is symmetrical development, and the Herbartian 
conception, that it is the development of character, what 
shall we take as our goal? 
Preparation for Rational Living the Object of Educa- 
tion. — Perhaps it is impossible to answer this question 
| more definitely than by saying that the object of education
-P-A-G-E-389
380 THE END OF EDUCATION. 
should be preparation for wise and rational living; com. 
plete living, Rousseau and Herbert Spencer have called it, 
wise and rational living not only in society, but in all the 
relations of life. Many people suppose that the object of 
education is the communication of knowledge. Manifestly 
that is a part of education. For how can I act wisely 
without knowledge? How can I take proper care of my 
health without some knowledge of hygiene? How can I 
train my child intelligently without some knowledge of 
Psychology? How can I vote intelligently without some 
knowledge of economics and history? How can I render 
these services to society upon the performance of which my 
livelihood depends without knowledge? Popular thought 
errs, therefore, by taking a part of the truth for the 
whole.” 
And the same is true of the Herbartian conception. 
All of us are members of society. A part of our lives is 
as members of society. But a man prepared to live wisely 
and rationally as a member of society only, would not be 
prepared for complete living; he would not be prepared to 
live wisely and rationally in @// of the relations of life. 
Elements of it.— What constitutes preparation for 
rational living ? Not sociad insight, social executive power, 
and social interest or responsiveness simply, as Dr. Dewey 
supposes, but insight into my own needs, and those of 
society in so far as it is related to me, ability to act accord- 
ingly, and the disposition so to act. In other words—the 
possession of a certain kind of knowledge; a certain dis- 
cipline of the intellect; a certain responsiveness of the 
emotions; a certain training of the will, I must have 
knowledge; I must be able to make the proper application
-P-A-G-E-390
A CERTAIN KIND OF KNOWLEDGE. § 381 
of my knowledge ; I must be disposed to do it ; I must be 
able to act on my disposition. 
(1) The Possession of a Certain Kind of Knowledge. — 
(1) The possession of a certain kind of knowledge. What 
kind? That which bears on action and legitimate enjoy- 
ment. Whatever I-need to know in order to act wisely 
and enjoy rationally the pleasures of life, my education 
should have taught me, or put me in a position to acquire. 
(2) Of a Certain Discipline of the Intellect. — (2) The 
possession of a certain discipline of the intellect. Dr. Dewey 
insists on the importance of constructiveness in contrast 
with mere absorption, and wisely, though for an unwise 
reason. Constructiveness and thought are essential, be- 
cause without them our pupils will not acquire the power 
to make a wise use of their knowledge. Without proper 
knowledge we can not act wisely, without ability to draw 
the proper inferences from our knowledge and make the 
proper applications of it we are equally incapable of wise 
action, . 
(3) Of a Certain Responsiveness of the Emotions. — 
(3) A certain responsiveness of the emotions. Our emo- 
tions constitute what I may call the worth-giving side of 
our natures, that side of our nature which determines our 
estimate of things. Now, as Davidson says, “it is not 
enough for a man to understand the conditions of rational 
life in his own time, he must likewise love these conditions, 
and hate whatever leads to life of an opposite kind. This 
is only another way of saying that he must love the good 
and hate the evil; for the good is simply what conduces
-P-A-G-E-391
382 THE END OF EDUCATION. 
to rational or moral life, and the evil simply what leads 
away from it. It is perfectly obvious, as soon as it is 
pointed out, that all immoral life is due to a false distribu. 
tion of affection, which again is often, though by no means 
always, due to a want of intellectual cultivation. He that 
attributes to anything a value greater or less than it really 
possesses in the order of things has already placed himself 
in a false relation to it, and will certainly, when he comes 
to act with reference to it, act immorally,” and, therefore, 
unwisely. 
(4) Of a Certain Training of the Will. — (4) A certain 
training of the will. “But again it is not enough,” 
Davidson continues, “for a man to understand correctly 
and love duly the conditions of moral life in his own time; 
he must, still further, be willing and able to fulfill these 
conditions. And he certainly can not do this unless his 
will is trained to perfect freedom, so that it responds, with 
the utmost readiness, to the suggestions of his discrimiat- 
ing intelligence and the movements of his chastened 
affections.” 
Respect for Expert Knowledge. — There is one char- 
acteristic of a man prepared to live wisely in our demo- 
cratic country of such overriding importance that I can 
not omit to mention it, the less so as I may seem to have 
fallen into the same error which vitiates Spencer’s reason- 
ing in his essay on “ What Knowledge is of Most Worth,” 
the mistake of supposing that the individual ought to be 
taught all that the society of which he is a member needs

QUESTIONS. : 383 
to know. J¢ should be a primary object of our teaching to 
develop in our pupils a sense of respect for, and of the 
tmportance of expert knowledge. 
I have already quoted one sentence from President Eliot 
bearing on this point. Let me quote another: “ Democ- 
racies will not be safe until the population has learned 
that governmental affairs must be conducted on the sam2 
principles on which successful private and corporate busi- 
ness is conducted and therefore it should be one of the 
principal objects of democratic education so to train the 
minds of the children that when they become adult they 
shall have within their own experience the grounds of 
respect for the attainments of experts in every branch of 
governmental, industrial, and social activity, and of con- 
fidence in their advice.”*

LESSON XLII. 
THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS. 
Importance of the Study of Children.— “All the roads 
in the Roman Empire led to the city of Rome.” At every 
turn and corner in our study of our subject, we have seen 
that successful teaching demands a. close, careful, and 
systematic study of children. At this stage in the history 
of the world, men have come to realize clearly the fact 
that, no matter what happens in the physical world, there 
is a cause for it. If a watch stops, or a lock refuses to 
. act, we know that there is a cause for it, and that a patient 
study of the facts of the case may enable us to discover 
and remove it. That is precisely the attitude which we 
should take toward our pupils. If they are not interested 
in any particular subject, if they are inattentive, if they 
do not like to go to school, there is a cause for it, and it is 
our business to learn what it is. Let us not be guilty of 
the stupidity of saying that some ‘boys “naturally” dislike 
school. That is an easy explanation to which lazy teachers 
have a great tendency to resort. But it has a painful like- 
ness to some of the explanations of the Middle Ages. 
“Moving bodies have a natural tendency to stop,” said 
the scholars of that time. “Some boys naturally dislike 
books,” say many of our teachers now. Precisely as a 
more careful study of the facts has thoroughly discredited 
384.
-P-A-G-E-394
‘ 
CHANGE IN PEDAGOGICAL STUDY. 385 
the former explanation, so I: believe a careful study of the 
facts will thoroughly discrédit the latter. 
Change in Pedagogical Study. — That the importance 
of the study of children is beginning to be generally 
recognized is one of the most encouraging signs of the 
times. In the beginning of the study of Pedagogy in this 
country, it was confined almost entirely to a study of 
methods. Later, it was seen that the most fruitful study 
of Pedagogy includes a study of the principles that under- 
lie methods; that in order to know ow to deal with the 
human mind, we must know why we deal with it thus and 
so; and that to know the why of our procedure, we must 
know the laws that govern it. And little by little educators 
have come to see that, after all, the text-book on Psychology 
which it is of most importance for teachers to study is one 
whose pages are ever open before them—the minds of 
their pupils, and the children with whom they come in 
contact. Never before in the history of the world was 
the importance of the study of Psychology to teachers 
so generally recognized as now. But, suggestive as a 
knowledge of it is to thoughtful and intelligent teachers, 
the best result to be expected from it is the development 
of what Dr. Josiah Royce calls the psychological spirit *X— 
the habit of observing children —and of the power to turn 
that spirit to the utmost possible account. In the first 
two chapters, we considered the benefits of the study of 
Psychology to the teacher. The conclusions there reached 
were such as seemed evident from the very nature of the 
case, independently of any special conclusions that our 
study of the mind would enable us to reach. And while

386 THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS. 
I believe that we shall all agree that the claims there made 
for it are fully borne out by the facts, I think we shall 
feel that if our study has made us more interested in the 
growth and development of the minds of children, more 
disposed to study them, less ready to dogmatize about 
them, more eager to learn by actual observation what they 
can do and what they can not do, what they like and what 
they do not like, the result of our study will be of incom- 
parably greater value than any there insisted on. 
Psychology and Education. — Because Psychology un- 
doubtedly underlies the science of education, I have seen 
what I can not but regard as a disposition to overestimate 
its importance. The opinion seems to be entertained in 
some quarters that every teacher should be a specialist in 
Psychology. If by that is meant that he must keep well 
abreast of psychological research, or that he should even 
_be especially interested in current psychological literature, 
I enter my emphatic dissent. Many an excellent teacher 
undoubtedly reproaches himself for his lack of interest in 
it, forgetting that it is as impossible for every teacher to 
have a special interest in Psychology as it is for them al! 
to have a special interest in mathematics or chemistry. 
By no such criterion should a teacher test his adaptation. 
for his work. But if a teacher finds himself without inter- 
est in children, if he has no disposition to investigate the 
causes of the facts that thrust themselves upon him every 
day, if he finds himself disposed to be content with merely 
verbal explanations — “ stupidity,” “prejudice,” “natural 
dislike of the subject,” “bad home surroundings,” “ ugli- 
ness,” etc., I would respectfully suggest that he carefully 
consider whether he has not mistaken his vocation. A
-P-A-G-E-396
DOCTRINE OF APPERCEPTION. 387 
specialist in Psychology every teacher should not be; 
special and careful students of the minds of their pupils 
all teachers should be. , 
_ Ido not, of course, undervalue the study of psychologi- 
cal literature. But I do believe that the greatest practical 
benefit it can render to the teacher consists in the help it 
can give him in his study of children. 
Doctrine of Apperception Shows the Necessity of 
Studying Children. — Our study of apperception will en- 
able us to see how indispensable is the study of children. 
Whether we are perceiving, remembering, imagining, con- 
ceiving, judging, or reasoning, we are alike apperceiving. 
But apperception is the relating activity of the mind, the 
activity by which a thing the mind is engaged in knowing 
is brought into relation with something the mind already 
knows. In order, then, that the event which we call 
knowledge may take place in the mind, two conditions 
must be realized: (1) ideas must exist in the mind of the 
pupil with which the thing to be known can be brought 
into conscious relation; and (2) the relation to be estab- 
lished by the particular kind of knowledge must be one 
which the mind is capable of perceiving. 
Contents of Children’s Minds. — No one but a careful 
student of children will avoid assuming that they know 
what they do not know, and, therefore, that they can 
understand what they do not understand. Educational 
journals have been emphasizing this point to such an ex- 
tent of late years that it would seem that the bare mention 
of it ought to be sufficient. Nevertheless, its importance 
is so great that I beg to quote a summary of the results of
-P-A-G-E-397
388 “THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS. 
the examination of some children in Germany: “It was 
found in thirty-three people’s schools in the Vogtland, in 
the examination of the newly entered six-year-old children 
in June of the year 1878, that of 500 city children ques- 
tioned, 82 per cent had no idea of ‘sunrise,’ and 77 per cent 
none of ‘sunset’; 37 per cent had never seen a grainfield, 
49 per cent had never seen a pond, 80 per cent a lark, 
and 82 per cent an oak; 37 per cent had never been in 
the woods, 29 per cent never on a river bank, 52 per cent 
never on a mountain, 50 per cent never in a church, 
57 per cent never in a village, and 81 per cent had not 
yet been in the castle of Plauen; 72 per cent could not 
tell how bread is made out of grain, and 49 per cent knew 
nothing yet of God. Similar conditions were shown in a 
factory village in the neighborhood of Reichenbach. In 
that place of 17 children only two knew any river, and 
what these called a river was a shallow ditch; only two 
knew anything of God, and one of these thought of the 
clouds instead. Relatively much more favorable results 
_ were obtained in the examination in the other village 
schools. Of the 300 elementary scholars in these only 
8 per cent had never seen a grainfield, 14 per cent had 
never seen a pond, 30 per cent a lark, and 43 per cent an 
oak; only 14 per cent had never been in the woods, 
18 per cent on the bank of a creek or river, 26 per cent on 
a mountain, 51 per cent in a church; only 37 per cent 
could not tell how bread comes from grain; and 34 per cent 
knew nothing of God.” The investigations of President 
Hall and Superintendent Greenwood showed the same 
diversity in the contents of children’s minds; the same 
lack of acquaintance with many things the knowledge of 
1 Lange’s Apperception, p. 161. . :
-P-A-G-E-398
ABILITY TO APPREHEND RELATIONS. 389 
which the teacher is likely to presuppose. Manifestly, if 
we hope to bring about that relating activity in the minds 
of our pupils in which all apperception consists, we must 
see to it that they have the Proper ideas in their minds. 
Ability to Apprehend Relations can not be Ascer- 
tained in any A Priori Way. — But the second condition 
is just as important, and, like the first, it can be ascertained 
only by the study of individual children. Whether a pupil 
can bring an idea which I wish to impart to him into the 
required relation to something he already knows depends 
on his power to apprehend the relation. When can 
children learn numbers? As soon as they can perceive 
numerical relations. A child can understand what “three” 
means when he can perceive the resemblance between 
three horses and three marbles—— when he can perceive 
that they resemble each other in being threes. Until 
then any attempt to teach him numbers must result in 
failure. When also can a pupil study technical grammar 
intelligently? When he can form the conceptions with 
which it deals. But the only way we can learn when a 
child can perceive numerical relations, or a boy form the 
conceptions required in the study of technical grammar is 
by actual investigation ; there is no a prior¢ method. 
How to Determine what is the Best Curriculum. — 
But these are not the only kinds of question which the 
study of individuals must answer. As the title of this 
lesson is intended to suggest, the term child-study is 
altogether too narrow to indicate the scope of the investi- 
gations that must contribute essential results to the science 
of education. Compare the courses of study of three
-P-A-G-E-399
390 THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS, 
typical institutions: Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. What 
is the reason for the fundamental differences between 
_ them? It is a difference of educational theories. The 
Harvard theory apparently is based on two suppositions: 
(1) that a primary purpose of education is to make a man 
an expert in some department, on the ground, in part, that 
the needs of modern life require that a man be capable of 
rendering expert service to society, in part, on the ground 
that a man who knows by his own experience what expert 
knowledge is will have proper respect for it in other lines; 
(2) that the field in which a man’s aptitudes best qualify 
him to become an expert will be most reliably indicated 
by his own unrestricted preferences. 
We have already seen that respect for expert knowledge 
is an indispensable part of a preparation for rational living. 
Among the questions, therefore, which must be answered 
before we have a right to a final opinion as to the wisdom 
of the Harvard plan, are these: (1) Does the possession of 
expert knowledge in one field give a man proper respect 
for it in other fields? (2) Are the unrestricted preferences 
of students the most reliable indications of their special 
aptitudes? These, manifestly, are questions of fact, ques- 
tions which can not be answered in any @ priori way. We 
can answer them only by a careful and comprehensive 
study of results, 
Importance of Discovering a Child’s Special Gift. — 
' We can further illustrate the necessity of the study of 
individuals by a quotation from the article already cited. 
«Another important function of the public school in a 
democracy,” says President Eliot, “is the discovery and 
development of the gift or capacity of each individual
-P-A-G-E-400
A CHILD'S SPECIAL GIFT. 391 
child. This discovery should be made at the earliest 
practicable age, and once made, should always influence, 
and sometimes determine, the education of the individual. 
It is for the interest of society to make the most of every 
useful gift or faculty which any member may fortunately 
possess; and it is one of the main advantages of fluent 
and mobile democratic society that it is more likely than 
any other society to secure the fruition of individual 
capacities. To make the most of any individual’s peculiar 
power, it is important to discover it early, and then train 
it continuously and assiduously. . . . In the ideal demo- 
cratic school no two children would follow the same course 
of study or have the same tasks, except that they would 
all need to learn the use of the elementary tools of educa- 
tion — reading, writing, and ciphering. The different 
children would hardly have any identical needs. . . . The 
perception or discovery of the individual gift or capacity 
would often be effected in the elementary school, but more 
generally in the secondary ; and the making of these dis- 
coveries should be held one of the most important parts of 
the teacher's work... . (There is no such thing as equality 
of gifts, or powers, or faculties, among either children or 
adults; on the contrary, there is the utmost diversity; and 
education and all the experience of life increase these 
diversities, because school and the earning of a livelihood, 
and the reaction of the individual upon his surroundings, 
all tend strongly to magnify innate diversities. The pre- 
tended democratic school with an inflexible programme is 
fighting not only against nature, but against the interests 
of democratic society. Flexibility of programme should 
begin in the elementary school years before the period of 
secondary education is reached. There should be some
-P-A-G-E-401
392. THE STUDY OF INDIVIDUALS, 
choice of subjects of study by ten years of age ; and much 
variety by fifteen years of age. On the other hand, the 
programmes of elementary as well as of secondary schools 
should represent fairly the chief divisions of knowledge, 
namely, language and literature, mathematics, natural 
science, and history, besides drawing and music. If school 
programmes fail to represent the main varieties of intel- 
lectual activity, they will not afford the means of discover- 
ing the individual gifts and tendencies of pupils.’ What- 
ever differences some of us may feel with respect to 
details, I think we shall all agree that one of the important 
functions of education is to help pupils discover what they 
are best fitted to do, and this function can only be per- 
formed by schools which lay great emphasis upon the 
study of individuals. - 
Extension of Study of Individuals by Means of 
History. — These illustrations, taken almost at random, 
have enabled us to realize how not only the science, but 
the art of education depends largely upon the study of 
individuals. If we extend this individual study by means 
of history, we shall find conceptions of the human mind 
constantly modified in a suggestive and helpful way. The 
sluggish Oriental, the intellectual Athenian, the super- 
stitious knight of the Middle Ages, are so many different © 
forms into which our common human nature has been 
carved by that marvelous sculptor — education. The 
teacher who studies history from the point of view of 
Psychology will not only find himself in possession of 
constantly growing and useful and inspiring knowl- 
edge of historical facts, but he will find his knowledge 
of the human mind enlarging, and his realization of the

almost omnipotence of education ever growing more 
vivid. 
Summary.— We may sum up the benefits which a 
study of children, or of individuals, as I prefer to state it, 
may render to the teacher as follows: (1) It will help him 
see at what stage in the development of his pupils the 
various subjects which’ pupils should study should be taken 
up; (2) it will help him in determining how much pupils 
can learn; (3) it will help him decide how much work can 
be safely required of pupils; (4) it will help him discover 
the special gifts of pupils; and (5) it will help him at 
every step in his work by helping him to ascertain what 
his pupils know of the subjects he is trying to teach.

APPENDIX A. 
‘THE case mentioned illustrates a dangerous tendency 
in our most highly organized schools —the tendency to 
forget the individual in the multitude. In our zeal for 
organization, we are in danger of losing sight of the fact 
that the school exists for the individual, not the individual 
for the school. However hard it may be to draw the line 
in practice, the principle is perfectly clear. Whenever it 
is evident that the individual will be injured by conforming 
to the requirements that are supposed to be good for the 
multitude, he should be excused from them. Society has 
. too great an interest in the best possible education of all 
its members to justify the sacrifice of any of them to the 
demands of an unattainable and therefore impracticable 
ideal. : 
APPENDIX B. 
Wun it is remembered that the inferential method 
may base its inferences on facts obtained in a variety of 
ways, it is easy to see that there may be various subdivi- 
sions of it. When its facts are obtained by comparing 
animals with human beings, it is called the comparative 
method; when by experiment—as when we ascerfain 
how long a time elapses from the contact of an object with 
any part of the body to the sensation-—it is called the 
experimental method, and so on.

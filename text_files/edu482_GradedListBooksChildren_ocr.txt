FOREWORD 
A general list of children’s books for home reading 
has long been needed. A beginning was made in 1915-16 
by the Elementary School Committee of the Library 
Section of the National Education Association, under the 
chairmanship of Miss Effie L. Power. That earlier com- 
pilation is the basis of the present list. The original 
plan of providing an annotated list of approximately one 
thousand standard children’s books, including classics, 
which would be useful in buying for the first nine grades, 
has been followed. 
The present list has been prepared with the needs 
of both teacher and librarian in mind. It does not as- 
sume to take the place of the Children’s Catalog com- 
piled by Miss Bacon or the Pittsburgh Catalogue of Chil- 
dren’s Books, which have been helpful in its preparation. 
Including as it does only books for general reading, 
the list must be supplemented with titles which meet 
local school needs. , No text books as such are included. 
For the convenience of teachers, a list of sixty reference 
books useful for the first nine grades has been added. 
As the limits and character of the list prevented a 
general rounding out of the subject material, the com- 
mittee provided no subject index, but the American Li- 
brary Association editorial staff has compiled the one 
included for such assistance as it will give, basing the 
work, by special permission, on the subject index sec- 
tion of the Pittsburgh Catalogue of Children’s Books. 
In the belief that no library, however modest in size, 
is complete without a few really artistic books, some of 
the more expensive editions illustrated by artists who 
appeal to young people have been included. Many chil- 
5  
-P-A-G-E-6
  dren have no opportunity in their daily lives to see 
beauty in line and color. A few finely illustrated edi- 
tions provide this beauty related to what is fine and 
lasting in literature. 
It will be noticed that there are three lists: Section 
A, picture books and easy reading books for children 
in grades one, two and three; Section B, titles for fourth, 
fifth and sixth grade pupils; Section C for seventh, 
eighth and ninth grade children. In order to place each 
book more accurately, all the grades in which it may 
be used are designated after the individual entry. 
A list is given below of the sources which were con- 
sulted for annotations. 
The selection of titles was made by members of the 
‘Elementary School Library Committee of the National 
Education Association for the years 1919-20 and 1920-21. 
The members of this committee were: 
Miss Annie S. Cutter, Head of School Department, 
Cleveland Public Library, Chairman. 
Miss JASMINE Britton, Board of Education, Library Di- 
vision, Los Angeles, California. 
Miss Nina C. BrorHerton, Principal, Carnegie Library 
School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Miss ANNE Eaton, Librarian, Lincoln School Library, 
New York City. 
Mr. Orton Lowe, Director of English, Department of 
Public Instruction, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 
The committee is indebted to Miss Effie L. Power, 
Director of Work with Children, Cleveland Public Li- 
brary, for advice in the final revision, and to Miss Bertha 
Hatch, Librarian-Teacher, Cleveland School of Educa- 
tion, for much valuable assistance in the general prepa- 
ration of the list.

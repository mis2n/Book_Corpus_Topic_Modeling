    PREFACE 
Tuis book is intended to be a guide-post on the 
road that leads to the adequate producing of plays for 
children. For that reason it includes a history of the 
children’s play movement, a chapter on its sociological 
aspects and suggestions for new fields, as well as chap- 
ters on play-producing, scenery, costumes, and proper- 
ties. It also gives a full list of plays adapted to the 
public schools, arranged according to the school grades, 
and a bibliography of child-drama for special holidays, 
and for camp and settlement use. Portions of this 
book have appeared in the following magazines and 
newspapers, to whom thanks are due for permission 
to republish: The Survey, The Normal Instructor,

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD- 
DRAMA 
To anyone not familiar with the astonishingly rapid 
¥ growth of the child-drama movement in this country 
the slogan of “ Every Public School a Community 
Theater” will come as a distinct surprise: yet it is 
not long since President Emeritus Charles Eliot of 
Harvard, in speaking of the dramatic instinct, pro- 
phetically said: “ Here is this tremendous power over 
children . . . that ought to be utilized for their good. 
It is true that the dramatic instinct is very general. 
. . Sol say that this power . . . is one that ought 
to be in at least every school in this country, and, more- 
over, I believe that it is going to be.” 
On every side it is evident that this prophecy is 
being fulfilled. The demand for children’s plays was. 
never so great as it is to-day, and coincident with the 
demand is a wish for a fuller knowledge of how to $ 
direct them, since there are few guide-posts on the way. 
Therefore, the object of this book is to tell in the 
simplest possible manner what to do, and what not to 
do in the producing of plays for children. The word 
children is used to indicate the happy occupants of the 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-10

years between six and fourteen, and by producing, the 
general stage-directing, costuming, and setting of a 
children’s play, so that it will have distinct educational 
and artistic value. It is for the school-child, not the 
stage-child, that this book is intended: for the teacher 
and drama enthusiast rather than the professional pro- 
ducer. It will consider both child-audience and child- 
player, and the results on both of a logical development 
of the dramatic instinct. It will discuss plays to fill 
the special needs of the public school, the social settle- 
ment, and the camp. It will also briefly consider the 
stage-play (i.e., professional play) for child-audiences. 
And as the whole movement of child-drama is signifi- _ 
cant from an educational and sociological, as well as 
a dramatic point of view, a brief history of its vicis- 
situdes will be included in the present chapter—from 
the days when little Greeks participated in the festivals 
to Athena, through the time when the Countess de 
Genlis established in France, in 1776, the first Theater 
of Education for Children that the world had ever 
known. From that time to our own is less than a 
hundred and fifty years, yet what a chamge has taken 
place! Instead of a single example of a children’s 
theater as was that of Mme. de Genlis, we now have 
child-plays and child-players throughout the country 
in public schools, social centers, and social settlements, 
fostered by educational and dramatic leagues, recog- 
nized as a power potent for good, and if rightly di- 
rected, a means of teaching patriotism, ethics, and art. 
Strange as it may seem, a children’s play written

DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 5 
for the special delight of child-audiences was undreamed 
of till the eighteenth century preached the rights of 
the child as well as the rights of man. Like many 
another modern movement, child-drama seems new, ~ 
when in reality it is not. It has come gropingly up 
through the ages. The need of it was dimly felt cen- 
turies before it appeared, just as the need for children’s 
literature and music was felt: but in the filling of 
these needs child-drama came last. Its development 
has been tidal, rising here, falling there, seeming to 
retreat utterly, only to come on in greater strength and 
fullness. 
From the earliest times children have participated 
in non-professional adult drama, though it was not 
till the establishment of the theater of Mme. de 
Genlis that they had a drama all their own, designed 
to fit their special needs. In the religious and com- 
munity festivals of ancient Greece, white-robed and 
flower-crowned children played a pictorial part. In 
the great historical dramas of Greece, notably in the 
Medea of Euripides, there were child parts; but these 
were played by masked adults of small stature. Chil- 
dren of shepherds and farmers appeared in the ritual 
before Pomona’s altar; boys of noble birth, crowned 
with vine leaves, were cup-bearers to the chorus of 
nobles in the Thargelian festivals. }-Little Britons took 
part in and witnessed some of the Druidic festivals. 
From the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries in the Eng- 
lish miracle and morality plays fostered by church, com- 
munity, and guild, children played many roles. In the
-P-A-G-E-12
  6 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
fifteenth century in England short plays were intro- 
duced into the public schools for boys} But these 
dramas were arranged to be played before adult audi- 
ences: child-player and child-audience were never con- 
sidered. 
y, ae lies the difference between the ancient and 
“modern play movement in the schools. Nowadays the 
benefit to be derived by child-player and child-audi- 
ence is the first consideration: in the fifteenth century 
the pleasure of the adult audience was the foremost 
thought. Whether the child-player benefited by the 
play, or even understood what it was about, was of no 
consequence. All that was asked of him was to learn 
his lines, parrot-wise, and be prompt with his cues. 
Richard the Third was a patron of the drama: his 
royal example led to a love of acting by gentleman 
amateurs. ‘‘ To the same example,” says Dr. Doran, 
in his Annals of the Stage, “‘ may be traced the custom 
of having dramatic performances in the public schools, 
the pupils being the performers. These boys, or in 
their place the children of the Chapel Royal, were fre- 
quently summoned to play in the presence of the King 
and Court.” Boys gave a ‘‘ command performance ” of a 
play in Latin before Henry the Eighth and his at- 
tendants; and in 1584 the children of the Chapel 
Royal presented The Arraignment of Paris, by George 
Peele, before Queen Elizabeth. 
Though there were extant no plays especially writ- 
ten for children, the miracle and morality plays were so 
naive, so direct and simple in their appeal, that they
-P-A-G-E-13
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 7 
were the nearest approach to child-drama of any of their 
predecessors. Written primarily for adults, they told 
their story with definitely labeled characters that could 
be understood by all. Anger, Meddlesome, and Make- 
peace could be readily recognized by children. Noah’s 
wife, who is quarrelsome and refuses to go into the ark; 
the bluff humor of the shepherd who steals a sheep, 
hides it in a cradle, and pretends it is a baby when its 
owner comes to look for it—no doubt many a rosy- 
cheeked youngster in doublet-and-hose laughed gleefully 
at such antics. Yet there were other characters it might 
be as well he did not see—grim skeletons representing 
death, black dream-haunting devils and carnal vices— 
creatures that had no part in his child-world. But, as 
has been said, in those days there was no drama for 
children, and whatever child happened to be in the audi- 
ence must perforce take bitter with the sweet. 
The Miracle play was the Sunday school of its time, 
and Bible history was learned through actual repre- 
sentation. The pageant, passing through the English 
towns on painted floats, drew crowds of children to 
witness its open-air performances. Bands of strolling 
players had child-auditors by the score. (See the 
first act of Josephine Peabody’s The Piper and Ben- 
net’s Young Master Skylark.) Of these plays the 
children appropriated what they could and left the 
rest. In the processional and decorative portions of the 
masque as it flourished in France and England, children 
also appeared, though there was often little in that 
form. of dramatic entertainment that they could
-P-A-G-E-14
  8 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
understand. In “ far Japan ” the plays of the No were 
flourishing, with occasional child-parts; in Italy were 
the guild plays, with rdles for little apprentices; every- 
where appreciation of the heart of childhood, and no- 
where any direct appeal to it. Children must take 
their drama at haphazard. 
With the opening of the London theaters which gave 
the English drama a local habitation and a name, the 
decline of community drama * began. For a short time 
they flourished side by side; then professional drama 
gained the ascendency. Not that there was ever any 
real rivalry between them. It was simply that drama 
was becoming more and more strictly an art of the 
theater, to be encompassed within four walls. Strip- 
lings were acting the parts of fine ladies or children. 
The day of the child-actor had begun, and with it the 
day of the child-player + ceased. It is a noticeable 
phenomena that the age which sees the greatest number 
of children acting professionally sees also the diminish- 
ing of community acting or spontaneous expression of 
the dramatic instinct among children. To the pres- 
ent writer it seems as if the exploitation of childhood 
and the commercialization of its tender talents was 
a subtle weed which choked the flower of uncommercial 
talent. They cannot flourish in the same soil. ‘The 
development of the dramatic instinct in the school- 
room with proper hours and surroundings is one thing; 
* Drama by the people.

ure; child-actor, one who plays for profit.
-P-A-G-E-15

child-actors traveling from place to place in an atmos- 
phere of over-excitement and fatigue is another.* 
The attendance of children at the indoor theaters 
of Shakespeare’s day was very small. The audience 
was mainly composed of grown-ups. Not a thou- 
sandth part of the children then knew Midsummer 
Night’s Dream as they know it to-day. Yet the fairy 
portions of it sound as if they had been written for 
children: 
“And I serve the fairy queen 
To dew her orbs upon the green. 
The cowslips tall her pensioners be: 
In their gold coats spots you see; 
These be rubies, fairy favors, 
In those freckles live their savors: 
I must go seek some dewdrops here, 
And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.” 
Here was an elfin fantasy for children and no child- 
audience to greet it! 
With community drama diminishing, two sources of 
participation for children remained: May Day, and 
its May Queen and Morris Dancers, its bells and 
garlands; Christmas Day, and its antique revels. 
While these festivals lasted children could count on 
being audience and participators too, though these were 
festivals rather than plays. 
*It is only fair to state that this is the author’s opinion, 
and that others differ from it. Such well-known pro- 
fessionals as Mr. Augustus Thomas and Mr. Francis Wilson 
believe in children acting professionally, while Miss Jane 
Addams and Mr. Owen Lovejoy, Secretary of the National 
Child Labor Committee, hold to the opposite.

Came Cromwell and the closing of the theaters, 
the cessation of May Day mumming: then the gay, dis- 
solute days of the Restoration, when no theater con- 
tained a play that was fit for children to witness. 
Community drama, that is, drama in which the people 
themselves took part as in the old miracles and moral- 
ities, had utterly vanished, not to return until our 
own day. 
The annals of eighteenth-century England contain 
almost no records of amateur acting by children, though 
a performance of Cato (!) by the children of the royal 
household has been duly chronicled. Prince George, 
afterwards George the Third, spoke the prologue; the 
epilogue was spoken by little Lady Augusta (as Prince 
Frederick called his daughter) and Prince Edward, 
afterwards Duke of York. Whatever school-plays were 
given were of this same order, pompous, grandilo- 
quent, without a spark of the fantasy childhood 
craved. Yet for the child-audience better times were 
in store. However meager child-drama in eighteenth- 
century England, however unimaginative the time, it 
did give one perennial figure to the stage that was to 
open the door to child-audiences—i.e., Pantaloon: a 
figure imported by Rich from the Commedia del Arte 
of Italy for the express purpose of amusing grown-ups. 
This Pantaloon did, in company with Harlequin, 
Columbine, and Punchinello, for many years. Then 
by degrees he came into his own true kingdom as the 
leading figure in the Christmas pantomimes which 
from about 1809 became the heritage of English chil-
-P-A-G-E-17
    
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA ti 
dren, and have remained so to the present day. Panta- 
loon was the father of the circus clown as we know 
him; just as Punchinello was the ancestor of Punch, 
chief actor in the puppet show of Punch and Judy, 
which our ancestors accepted without a qualm as be- 
ing suitable for child-audiences. Nowadays the hor- 
ror and cruelty of Punch are no longer considered 
amusing. He is banished. And with him much that 
is brutal and ugly. 
In the other European countries the participation of 
child-audience and child-player fluctuated as it did in 
England. Little apprentices took part in the Guild 
Plays of the Italian cities: Holland, Germany, and 
France had their periods of community drama cor- 
responding to that of the miracle and morality plays: 
there were folk and church festivals in which children 
participated. These grew fewer as the stage-plays 
grew more numerous. The continent abounded in 
puppet-shows long before England had them, but 
the stories they acted were not for children’s eyes or 
ears. 
In the convents and schools of France children 
played in “moral comedies” that were as stiff as 
Cato, and like Cato, primarily intended for older 
pupils. Then in the days of Marie Antoinette and the 
“intellectual ferment ” came the most dynamic change 
that child-drama had ever known. The long urge for 
plays designed to fit the needs of children at last found 
an answer. 
We who live in the twentieth century, who see all 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  i2 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
about us children’s reading-rooms, children’s courts, 
and children’s hospitals; who are accustomed to: books, 
pictures, and music designed especially for children, 
can hardly realize that there was a time when these 
things did not exist. But when the educational doc- 
trines of Rousseau startled Europe people were shaken 
from a lethargy, made to think, to regard the child 
individually instead of collectively, to realize that child- 
hood had claims of its own. 
Among those who profited by Rousseau’s theories 
was the Countess de Genlis, herself a born teacher, a 
pioneer blazing new trails. She studied the intellectual 
and spiritual needs of children, and in her searching 
presently realized that no plays had been written with 
a child-audience in view, that there was not a single 
drama, with the exception of Shakespeare’s Midsum- 
mer Night’s Dream (then seldom given), that could 
give delight to child-audiences. Therefore, the Count- 
ess de Genlis, greatly influenced by Rousseau’s Emile, 
or Treatise on Education, established on her estate, at 
the Chateau de Genlis, a Theater of Education for 
Children (1776-1780). Here the De Genlis children 
acted plays written by their far-seeing and gifted 
mother, who believed that through the wise cultivation 
of the dramatic instinct children could be taught not 
only such lessons of language and history as education 
demanded, but the “elementary lessons of life,”— 
things of the heart and spirit not contained in text- 
books. Thus the very first plays ever written for 
children. came to be acted.
-P-A-G-E-19
  
  DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 13 
The Theater of Education was a rustic one, some- 
thing in the style of that at the Little Trianon. It had 
a stage and seats, blue sky for a roof, splendid trees 
for a background, and sunshine for footlights. In a 
little play called The Dove the tyranny of dress was 
satirized. Another play dealt with the “annals of 
vertue.” Perhaps nowadays we would consider them 
a little stiff and formal; but we must remember that 
they were written in a stiff and formal time, and that 
child-players and child-audience alike found delight in 
them. 
The Theater of Education for Children and the re- 
sults obtained there attracted the notice of the Electress 
of Saxony, and Mme. de Genlis therewith became in- 
structress to the children of the Duc and Duchesse de 
Chartres, employing the same methods (i.e., the edu- 
cational influence of the theater) as she had with her 
own. History plays were given as a means of teaching 
history: the child-players took part in small civic pro- 
cessions, riding on gayly caparisoned ponies. How 
much further this influence might have gone we have 
no means of determining, for the actual and terrible 
drama of the French Revolution began, and its coming 
rang down the curtain on the first experiment in plays 
for children. Thereafter there was a lull. Berquin 
wrote some playlets for children that, as one critic has 
termed them, ‘“‘ were so moral that they were im- 
moral.” Then there was a return to the same type 
of adult plays for children that had flourished before. 
But true child-drama was not dead: it was, like the

Princess in the fairy tale, only waiting to be awakened 
again at the right time. 
IL 
As has been said, the early nineteenth century de- 
veloped the Christmas pantomime in England, to the 
great delight of child-audiences. In the mid-nineteenth 
century the child again came forward as participator. 
An operetta for children appeared on the horizon in 
the form of incidents from Mother Goose, loosely 
strung together, and containing such popular characters 
as Little Boy Blue, Miss Muffet, The Old Woman 
Who Lived in a Shoe, and Mother Goose herself. 
This operetta was purely a community production—a 
kind of folk-play, if one might call it so, acted by the 
children of whatever community happened to give it. 
Its author’s name is lost in oblivion—if it ever had an 
author; but one somehow believes that, like Topsy, it 
“just grew.” It was popular alike in England and 
America: it was healthy, innocent, child-like. The 
sleeping Princess was waking! 
Pinafore was long regarded as an opera to, which 
one might take children, though the whimsicality of 
its humor was far beyond them; and Uncle Tom’s 
Cabin was another play to which children were taken, 
though slave whips and tragic deaths are not now 
deemed wise entertainment for children. 
For a long while these three plays were the only 
drama for children that America had. Puritan times  
-P-A-G-E-21
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 15 
had frowned on the child-player: Colonial days were 
too stressful to think of child-drama, and the next 
decade too poor, too fraught with the rigors of ad- 
justment. 
Fashions in drama change, as do all fashions, and 
if a sturdier idea of boyhood makes Little Lord Faun- 
tleroy seem a trifle too “ girlish” for us now, he was 
in his day a charming, buoyant figure, bringing with 
him a sense of wholesome reality that showed up Rollo, 
Sandford and Merton, and the children in Elsie, 
Queechy, and the Wide, Wide W orld, for the artificial, 
goody-goody creatures that they were. Little Lord 
Fauntleroy and Dearest ended the reign of literature 
known as “the didactic school for children” and be- 
gan a dynasty of normal books and stage-plays for 
young folks. Little Lord Fauntleroy was the hero of 
the first professional play designed for children, and 
he appealed to young and old alike, opening the way 
for the production of other stage-plays designed for 
children,* such as Prince and Pauper, Editha’s Bur- 
glar and The Little Princess, which delighted child- 
audiences all over the country and are in use to-day 
in amateur dramatic clubs. 
In the public schools (grade schools), with the ex- 
ception of a few crude attempts at drama, “ piece 
speaking ” was still the only use to which the dramatic 
instinct was put. Children galloped with Paul Revere, 
* The idea that adults could play children’s parts, as Miss 
Maude Adams dves now in Peter Pan, had not then oc- 
curred.  
-P-A-G-E-22
  16 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
or hung breathless from the window with Barbara 
Fritchie by word of mouth. They never acted. 
The social settlements * were the first to recognize 
the need for children’s plays, and put on home-made 
versions of The Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and The 
Three Bears. These early productions were not up 
to the standard set to-day, but they served their purpose 
and their time. They were the forerunners of the 
work that is now being done. Among the private 
schools of this country the School of Ethical Culture 
in New York City is a most significant pioneer in 
play and festival work, setting a standard for the lat- 
ter that other schools would do well to emulate. 
In 1903 a Children’s Theater, under the direction of 
Mrs. Nettie Greenleaf, was established in Boston, on 
Huntington Avenue, near the public library. It gave 
matinées only: its actors were drawn from the Dorothy 
Dix Home for Stage Children—that is, the children 
of actors and actresses who were on the road and 
could not have their little folk with them. The chil- 
dren went to school, like every other normal child, and 
rehearsed in the late afternoon at about the same hour 
that other children were practicing five-finger exercises. 
The director adhered to the principle of giving two 
short one-act plays with separate casts rather than a 
long play, which might prove fatiguing to the young 
(often very young!) actors. As most of the children 
planned to enter the same profession as their fathers 
and mothers when they reached mature years, the

-P-A-G-E-23
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 17 
afternoon performances of the Children’s Theater were 
simply an exercise in dramatic art for those taking 
part. The plays given were largely of the type then 
produced by the social settlements—Cinderella and 
The Conquest of Santa Claus, etc., the only plays avail- 
able on a small royalty. They had no especial beauty 
or ethical quality, but they were the best that could be 
had. The theater was always well patronized, but 
was condemned by the authorities as being unsafe (after 
the Iroquois fire in Chicago caused better fire protec- 
tion), and was forced to close its doors. 
’ Also in 1903 in the building owned by the Educa- 
tional Alliance, New York City, was started The 
Children’s Theater. It was founded by Miss Alice 
Minnie Herts, and its dramatic director was Mrs. 
Emma Sheridan Fry. The work of the theater was 
along broadly educational lines. Thus the idea that 
the Countess de Genlis had established a century and 
more before was made significant in America. 
This theater was situated in the heart of New York’s 
East Side. Its players were drawn from the surround- 
ing neighborhood, its audiences likewise. The ages 
of those participating in the plays ran all the way from 
eight or nine to the early twenties. The plays were 
carefully chosen, with the needs of audience and play- 
ers in mind. The Tempest was the first play pro- 
duced: this was followed by Ingomar, As You Like It, 
and The Fairy Ring. Then came other plays: Little 
Lord Fauntleroy, Snow White, The Little Princess, 
Prince and Pauper, Editha’s Burglar, and a number of
-P-A-G-E-24
  18 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
one-act pieces, including 4 Comedie Royal, The End 
of the Way, and The House of the Heart. The 
theater was always well attended. Its rate of admis- 
sion was low, and its performances were of undoubted 
benefit to the community, for children in that neigh- 
borhood had little else than tawdry moving-picture 
shows as their means of recreation, as the licensing board 
of the “ movies” was not then extant. There were 
three performances a week, and since the neighborhood 
was largely Hebrew, matinées were given on Sundays. 
Very often a lecturer would explain the plays in the 
tongue spoken by the fathers and mothers of the chil- 
dren. This led to a general appreciation of what was 
being acted. The theater closed in 1909, and after 
an interval a group of young people, incorporated 
under the name of The Educational Players, began to 
carry on the same principles of educational acting that 
were developed by Mrs. Fry for the Children’s Theater. 
But between the closing of this theater and the in- 
corporation of The Educational Players, a significant 
thing had occurred: plays frankly and avowedly for 
the public schools had been written, and published. 
That meant that the drama was not to be confined to 
whatever spot happened to have a children’s theater, 
isolated from the rest of the vast city, separated by 
s of carfare that prohibited many children 
from going, even if they had the price of admission. 
‘The play in the public school meant plays for the chil- 
dren of every district: not only that, but it meant that 
the plays were to be given free. No admittance fee 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 19 
was to be charged. Moreover, no royalty was to be 
required for the plays. ‘They were to be acted by ama- 
teurs without payment of any kind. They began to be 
acted in the public schools: sometimes the performances 
given were good; sometimes they contained much mis- 
directed effort. But always it was effort, a reaching 
toward the goal. The demand for plays was so great 
that the use of the school auditoriums for school drama 
began. It was coeval with the growing demand for 
recreation centers. 
In 1911, the Educational Players began to work in 
connection with the public schools; but as the Players 
were not children, but young men and women, they 
had children for audience rather than as co-players. 
Occasionally, however, they co-operated, as exemplified 
in their excellent school production of The Little 
Princess, and a performance of Midsummer Night’s 
Dream, in which young people employed in stores and 
factories played the parts of Titania, Lysander, and 
Hermia, while school children acted Peasblossom, 
Mustardseed, and the rest of the fairies. ‘The play 
was admirably managed from all points of view. The 
adults and children rehearsed separately, the former in 
the evening, the latter in the afternoon. Only at the 
final rehearsals did they rehearse together. Although 
the performance ‘was to be given indoors, the children’s 
rehearsals were conducted out of doors, in Bronx Park. 
Thus the enchanted wood of the play seemed wonder- 
fully real to them, and they were imbibing dramatic 
instruction and fresh air at the same time!

  20 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
Feeling the wide and still unfilled needs of schools 
' and social centers for standardized dramatic work, the 
Educational Dramatic League was organized in Janu- 
ary, 1913. (Mrs. August Belmont, President.) Its 
object was (and is) the promotion in Public Schools, 
Social Centers, Recreation and Civic Centers of Ama- 
teur Dramatic Performances having an educational 
value. Its object is national, not local. It stands 
ready to advise clubs and schools the country over. Its 
plans are both idealistic and utilitarian: for, while 
raising the standard of dramatic production, it*calls for 
no new equipment, but only a better utilization of the 
material at hand. Youthful dramatic “ clubs” have 
sprung up in schools and settlements, and the League 
works co-operatively with these, lending books of plays, 
histories of the drama, costume plates, costumes, and 
sets of screens for backgrounds for a very small sum. 
It also suggests leaders or teachers for the various 
clubs; and sustains a class that teaches teachers how 
to direct plays. Last year in New York City fifty-one 
teachers were registered members of the League. 
‘Twenty-five clubs came under the League’s stimulating 
influence: there were twelve associate clubs, and three 
classes in story-playing. And this after only a year’s 
work! 
The League actively co-operated with such associa- 
tions as the Music School Settlement, the New York 
Kindergarten Association, the Gerry Society, Young 
Women’s Christian Association, the Vacation Com- 
mittee, the Camp Fire Girls, the Public Schools, the

Recreation Centers, and many Settlements. It was 
found that the ages of those wishing to enroll with the 
League ranged all the way from eight to twenty-six, so 
Junior and Senior departments were formed. In order 
to bring about co-operation and promote a community 
spirit in these unrelated groups, a competition was 
organized, and a bronze tablet supplemented by a 
money prize was offered for the best performance. The 
tablet must be awarded three successive times to the 
same club in order to be permanently won. In the 
1913 competition the play selected for the Juniors was 
The House of the Heart, and for the Seniors Pyg- 
malion and Galatea. For the 1914 competition the 
Junior play is the first act of The Little Princess, and 
the Senior play Clyde Fitch’s Nathan Hale. With the 
Juniors the greatest care is taken that no over-fatigue 
or excitement shall mar the performance. The League 
believes in early hours and short plays for children; in 
having plays throughout the city rather than in one 
district; and in having a high standard for the least 
thing done. The aims of the League are indorsed by 
such well-known authors as Edmond Rostand, Maurice 
Maeterlinck, Lady Gregory, Sir Arthur Pinero, Arnold 
Bennett, and John Galsworthy. 
In all the highways and byways of the city life 
child-drama is making itself manifest. Story-telling 
in the New York Public Libraries has led to giving 
plays in the libraries. Usually the play is told in 
story form first, and acted. afterwards. Outdoor 
plays have been given on recreation piers, and city

roofs, as well as in the sylvan reaches of the 
parks. 
Educators find in the children’s play a wonderful 
means of developing defectives. Plays are given. by the 
deaf and dumb; also story pantomimes are acted by 
the latter. Blind children recently gave a one-act 
play in aid of the Lighthouse, a recreative center for 
the blind. 
The church, which in medieval times first fostered 
the play movement, is now returning to its ancient be- 
lief in drama as a moral force. St. George’s Church 
is particularly active in this direction, and has given 
some unique performances of St. George and the 
Dragon, the street in front of the church being closed 
to traffic while the play was in progress. A play given 
outdoors in a city street! St. George and the Dragon 
in the heart of New York City, pavements underfoot, 
city blocks on all sides, their windows crowded with 
the heads of spectators intent on seeing children act a 
medieval play! * 
Festival plays for children are given on some of the 
Jewish feast-days. Children’s plays are given under 
the auspices of several of the Catholic churches. Per- 
formances by the Ben Greet Players (professional 
actors, not young people) have been given under the 
auspices of The Wage-Earners’ Theater League in the 
school-yards of Manhattan. Performances by this com- 
*In this connection might be noted Eager Heart, a beauti- 
ful Christmas mystery play, produced by various communities 
throughout the country at the holiday season.

pany have also been given in the public school audi- 
toriums at a price that put them within the reach of 
anyone. The Shakespeare Centenary, May, 1914, was 
celebrated not only by performances by this company, 
but by children’s festivals in the parks, and public 
school performances by the Dramatic League and the 
Educational Players. 
All this represents the work done in New York 
City; but all over the country the influence of child- 
drama is being felt. In Ohio, in 1911, Group Read- 
ings were introduced into the public schools through 
the pages of The Normal Instructor. A folk-play in 
three acts and five scenes (The Silver Thread) was 
studied in the schoolrooms. The play had a large cast, 
and each child was made responsible for whatever char- 
acter he or she assumed. The scenes were laid in 
Cornwall, and everything connected with Cornish 
history and geography was diligently studied. This was 
the first time that Group Reading had ever been used 
in the public schools, and it proved extremely service- 
able. It kept the children interested, their English 
improved through play-reading, the urge of the drama 
as it gathered impetus made for clearer enuncia- 
tion. This method is now in use in many of the 
schools. 
In Cincinnati the School of Expression conducts a 
Children’s Theater, giving special performances every 
year, the students in the school taking part, and the 
school children of Cincinnati forming the audience. 
The little theater of Hull House, Chicago, gives splen-

did productions of children’s plays; the social settle- 
ments of Boston, notably Lincoln House and South 
End House, are equally active along these lines. 
Under the auspices of the Boston Women’s Educa- 
tional and Industrial Union has been established an 
association called the Children’s Players—a group of 
amateurs from college and private dramatic clubs, 
acting under the Union’s management. Each year they 
present a play for children, generally during the Christ- 
mas holidays. It is staged in a local theater. Three 
performances are given, two matinées and a morning 
dress rehearsal. ‘The matinées are played at the usual 
theater rates; at the morning performance the seats are 
placed within the range of the most slender pocket- 
book, so that children from all over the city can attend. 
A little theater called The House of Play, in Washing- 
ton, D. C., regularly produces plays for children and 
young people, children forrhing both audience and 
player-guild. The theater is run under the auspices 
of the Drama League. Neighborhood House, a Wash- 
ington Settlement, gives children’s plays and festivals, 
the costumes of which are all designed, dyed, and made 
up at the settlement itself. The performances of the 
Ethical Culture School in New York have already been 
mentioned. All the settlements in New York have 
departments of child-drama, including the University 
Settlement, Greenwich House (which gives a Chil- 
dren’s Festival every year), and the Henry Street Set- 
tlement, where splendid work is done under the direc- 
tion of the Misses Lewisohn.

The ten settlements of Brooklyn, N. Y., united in 
1911 in giving in Prospect Park The Pageant of Pa- 
triots, the first children’s historical pageant ever given 
in America. It does not rightly belong under the 
heading of plays, save that each episode in the 
pageant was written in a play form, which made it 
possible to detach it from the whole pageant and give 
it separately. This pageant dealt with the youth of 
American heroes and depicted scenes from the lives of 
Daniel Boone, Franklin, Washington, and Lincoln be- 
fore an audience of ten thousand people. Up to that 
time the settlements had carried on their dramatic work 
separately, but the pageant drew them all together to 
work for a common cause. Each settlement took an 
episode in the pageant, and after the pageant was over 
these episodes were repeated by some of the settlements 
in their own districts. Later this pageant was given for 
the “Safe and Sane Fourth” of Boston and other 
cities. 
During’ the week of June 7, 1914, a Festival and 
Pageant of Nations was produced in New York City 
under the auspices and guidance of The People’s In- 
stitute and Social Center Public School 63. Every 
afternoon and evening during the entire week singing, 
dancing, and drills took place in a huge cleared space 
running from Eleventh to Twelfth Street, and from 
Avenue A to First Avenue. The culmination of the 
pageant was marked by a beautiful symbolical idea of 
the different nations bringing to Columbia gifts that 
typified their chief arts and industries. Everywhere  
-P-A-G-E-32
  26 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
was life, movement, color. Italians marching under 
their gay banners, Jews with the blue and white flag 
of Zion, Hungarians, Russians, Poles, Galicians, Ger- 
mans, and Norwegians—all in folk-costume. Two 
thousand children and one thousand grown-ups par- 
ticipated in the pageant before an audience of about 
twenty thousand people. It brought about a tremen- 
dous stimulation of race pride and race intelligence. 
Besides this children are participating in all the adult 
historical pageants that are lending to our own time 
something of the glory of medieval days, pageants that 
give the youth of our country a clear idea of the de- 
velopment of both national and community history. 
As little Puritans, Indians, Colonials, and Pioneers, 
children have greatly added to the effectiveness of 
the Pageants of Peterboro, Deerfield, Schenectady, 
Arlington, Thetford, Westchester, Portland, and 
others. As in the old days, they are now participating 
in Masques, in the St. Gaudens Masque, The Bird 
Masque, The Masque of St. Louis, in the Allegory 
given on the steps of the Treasury in Washington, 
D.C. 
The Drama League, established for the furtherance 
of the best plays, has branches in all the large cities and 
towns, and maintains a Junior Department which issues 
pamphlets listing available plays for children. It also 
supplies lecturers on child-drama. 
Meantime, in the professional theaters, the charm 
of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, and the delicate fan- 
tasy of such plays as Snow White, Peter Pan, and The

DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD-DRAMA 27 
_ Blue Bird, have given such children as were fortunate 
- enough to see them much of the material of dreams. 
The Blue Bird and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm 
were both produced in England, where, partly due to 
the rise of the Historical Pageant movement, plays 
for children received a sudden impetus. They are not 
yet used educationally as in America, but undoubtedly 
they will be in time. The social settlements of Eng- 
land are active in producing children’s plays, notably 
Toynbee Hall, London, where the first children’s 
Pageant of English History, by Louis N. Parker, was 
given in 1910. A collection of English history plays 
are published, and their amateur performance fur- 
thered by the “‘ League-of the Empire.” ‘These plays 
deal with the heroes of English history, with Alfred, 
Richard Coeur de Lion, bluff King Hal, the Black 
Prince, Robin Hood, and so on; and inculcate patriot- 
ism, not only in Merrie England, but in Canada, Aus- 
tralia, New Zealand, and India, wherever child- 
players of the empire are. “The Guild of Play” 
strives to conserve the national folk-dances and festi- 
vals: it collects and publishes these, as well as music 
and costume plates. The Bermondsey Guild of Play- 
children took an important part in the great English 
Church Pageant of 1909. The Village Children’s His- 
‘torical Play Society was founded in Winchelsea in 
1910. As its title indicates, it gives historical plays. 
The productions are of a high standard, dramatically 
and artistically. Ludlow Castle, a play by the Hon. 
Mrs. Percy Mathewson, was given this year. The
-P-A-G-E-34

very beautiful costumes were designed by Edich Craig. 
In Ireland, largely due to the influence of the Irish 
Theater, poetic plays of Irish history are given in the 
boys’ schools, with a beauty and simplicity of effect such 
as we have come to associate with the performances of 
the Irish Players. 
In the other countries of Europe, in the spontaneous 
Italian festivals, in German pageants similar to that 
of Rothenburg, in the children’s festivals given at 
Versailles, at the performances of the Instituto Inter- 
nationale in Spain, everywhere the child-drama move- 
ment is slowly yet surely coming into its own, though 
by far the greatest strides have been made by America 
and England—indeed, in the respect of utilizing drama 
as‘an educational force in its public schools, America 
may be said to lead the world. 
The child-drama movement is only a part of the 
whole great movement of recreative art made manifest 
on all sides through pageantry, festival, and the 
masque—a movement reaching toward that “ redemp- 
tion of leisure” set forth so glowingly in the Civic ° 
Theater. By strange roads and ways, with many 
backward turnings and cessations, and again with the 
tush of forced marches, has the children’s play move- 
ment gone forward. Much has been done. Much is 
yet to do. But that it will be done who can question?

CHILD-PLAYER AND CHILD- 
AUDIENCE 
One of the first questions that arise in dealing with 
plays for children is: Why should there be plays for 
children at all? What claim have they on drama? 
Why are children’s plays now given in all our school- 
houses, settlements, camps, and recreation centers? 
Yet one does not have to look far for the answer. It 
is written in the eager, vivid faces of children waiting 
outside the “ nickel arcades” in our great cities; it is 
sometimes stamped on the heavy, uninspired counte- 
nances of country children who have “never had a 
chance,” for whom the imaginative life is a closed 
book. The former are avid in their quest for the 
stuff that is the substance of dreams; the latter do not 
know that the stuff exists. The needs of each are so 
vital and imperative that it is hard to determine which 
requires guidance most. 
In The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets, Jane 
Addams has shown us, with crystal clearness, a picture 
of “a group of children and young people emerging 
from a theater with the magic of the play still thick 
upon them.” They have been for hours in their 
29
-P-A-G-E-36
  30 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
“veritable house of dreams”; now once again they 
face the world of actuality. If they belong to the rank 
and file of everyday, has what they witnessed in “ the 
house of dreams” brought something beautiful and 
glamourous into the harsh realities of their daily lives? 
Has it given them something of inner strength with 
which to meet the actualities?“ For to-day we know it 
is not only the work or study hours of the individual 
that are important: we have come to realize that the 
leisure hours are equally significant, equally fraught 
with redemption or menace. We know that in an age 
of abnormal commercialism one of the chief needs is 
the freeing of the imagination. Age resigns its dreams; 
youth demands that its dreams be fulfilled, it urges that 
the gray of life be shot with the iridescence of the 
heroic and wonderful. Above all, it demands action, 
and it is an incontestable fact that drama is action, 
that it makes a more dynamic appeal to all sorts and 
conditions than does any other art. It can both waken 
and guide. It appeals to all young people and chil- 
dren through the dramatic instinct, the instinct that 
strives to fulfill youth’s dreams, that yearns to be 
heroic, wonderful, and different. To conserve this in- 
stinct and to turn it into the right channels is what the 
child-drama movement is trying to do by supplying 
adequate plays for children, and places in which to 
give the plays. 
That this dramatic instinct is well-nigh universal 
goes almost without saying. There is a spark of the 
dramatic instinct in almost everyone, just as there is 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  
  PLAYER AND AUDIENCE 31 
a spark, though often obscured, of the poetic instinct. 
‘The poet is the seer, or se-er. Cultivate the dramatic 
instinct, and you waken the poetic. Vitalize the poetic, 
and you make people see. It is the people who see that 
have moved the world. Jane Addams is a poet working 
in terms of humanity; Galileo was a poet working in 
terms of astronomy. Nations are judged, not by their 
natural resources or the wealth their citizens have, but 
by the human beings they produce. And the right use 
of the dramatic instinct tends to develop human beings. 
It can confidently be claimed for it that it is of bene- 
fit to the child-player, the child-audience, and the com- 
munity at large. Let us consider them in turn. 
CuiLp-PLAYER 
a the first place, it must be made clear that the 
development of the dramatic instinct does not tend to 
make actors, but imaginative human beings. To study 
music in the schools does not necessarily mean that one 
must be a musician. Drawing is taught in all the 
schools, but that does not mean that every school- 
child is to become an artist. It is merely enlarging his 
horizon, adding to his store of knowledge, making him 
a more appreciative citizen. And this is precisely what 
the child-drama movement strives to do. It seeks to 
widen horizons mentally and ethically, to provide a 
fabric for dreams, since out of dreams, from time im- 
memorial, has sprung achievement. 
In all children there is a love of the beautiful and
-P-A-G-E-38
  32 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
heroic, though it is often hidden under layers of bash- 
fulness, stultification, or seeming indifference. One 
has only to rouse the dormant dramatic instinct to 
find that this love is there. It exists equally in the 
Child-who-has-Too-Little and the Child-who-has-Too- 
Much. Give a farm-child a chance to be a young 
Minute Man, give a little newsboy, once in his life, a 
chance to be a hero; let an average little girl play she 
is a princess—a princess with sweet and gracious man- 
ners; let the Child-who-has-Too-Much become a little 
pioneer without luxuries who must make the most of 
everything that comes her way, and, under wise guid- 
ance, you have done something for all of them. You 
have given them the reaction of a new environment. 
The newsboy dropped the patois of the street to be- 
come the hero; the young Minute Man must hold 
himself erect; the*little princess played with charm of 
manner; the youthful pioneer enlarged her vision. 
More than this: if the play has literary value, they 
have added to their vocabulary, stimulated their 
memories, and learned to express themselves. Clearness 
of enunciation has been gained; they have obtained 
a knowledge of team-work, of how necessary the effort 
of each individual is to the success of any uridertaking. 
Moreover, if the play has any real value (and from 
the standpoint of Mme. de Genlis and all other work- 
ers in child dramatics this is the most important thing 
of all) they have gained an ethical lesson, a “ criticism 
of life.” 
Says the bulletin of the Educational Dramatic 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  PLAYER AND AUDIENCE 33 
League: “ We train the young in statistics, in how to _\ 
work. Isn’t it worth while to add to their training ” 
a little knowledge of that vital part of them—their 
emotions? Show them the point, the critical moment 
in which the villain of the play becomes villain, and 
how the same emotion which brought this about, dif- 
ferently handled, could have made him a hero.” Thus 
countless lessons can be taught through child-drama. 
What was The Blue Bird but an inspired preachment 
that the humblest, humdrum things of life were often 
the most beautiful? 
Give children a morality play to act, and they learn 
something of the effects of good and evil; give them a 
fairy play, and you have taken them into the country 
of the imagination; give them a nature play, and they 
grasp a knowledge of the world around them; while a 
history play makes them appreciate the valor and self- 
sacrifice that went to the upbuilding of our nation. 
This much the play can do for the child-player. It is 
an acknowledged fact. But it might do even more. For 
the average citizen life is filled with work and conflict, 
with a hundred setbacks and unexpected difficulties. 
Why not teach the child who is later to be the citizen 
to live dramatically, to dramatize his difficulties? It 
will give interest and color to life, and lend keen ex- 
hilaration to what otherwise might be a gray and dis- 
couraging existence. Poverty is a monster to be con- 
quered. Discontent another. Failure another. Diffi- 
culty an antagonist to whom one must give deadly 
combat if one would succeed. Through the stimulus  
-P-A-G-E-40
  34 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
of the dramatic instinct many a war might be won on 
the battleground of the spirit. 
Vocational Guidance is a modern movement that 
could be greatly aided through drama—real drama, I 
mean, not the inner drama. Vocational Guidance 
should be dramatized. ‘The trades and their demands, 
tewards, and opportunities could be clearly shown. 
Such plays would go far toward solving the problem 
of the misfit, the hopeless drifters that fill our cities. 
For surely one of the greatest tragedies of our American 
life is this very misfitness. There is no more calamitous 
figure than the youth who is drifting, who has not dis- 
covered what he wants of life, and no moment more 
filled with import than that in which he discovers what 
his goal is to be. Everyone knows the story of how the 
youthful Benjamin Franklin was taken by his father 
to see all the different trades, with tradesmen at work, 
so that he might actually visualize them, and make his 
choice of a lifework wisely and whole-heartedly. 
Plays for Vocational Guidance might do just this. 
Remedial plays, they might be called. They could 
also teach that it is never too late to make a fresh be- 
ginning, or to start anew. Endurance, Struggle, Cour- 
age, Hope, are all figures to stir the heart of youth, 
and they can be seen banishing the figures of Too- 
Late or Never-Never! The Ideal and the fight to 
attain it is not too difficult of comprehension for the 
schoolgirl or schoolboy in the higher grades, in those 
years when the thoughts of youth are “long, long 
thoughts.” “Blessed is the man who has found
-P-A-G-E-41
  PLAYER AND AUDIENCE 35 
his work,” says Carlyle, and the boy is father to 
him. 
“ But suppose that child-drama cultivates a love of 
acting,” cries the extreme conservative. To which one 
can answer, “ Is not amateur acting on a par with ama- 
teur music? Is not the child or adult entitled to 
‘imagination in recreation’?” The love of any art 
gives joy to its votary. Better the youth of the country 
expressing themselves through plays, festivals, and folk- 
dance than through street-corner lounging, dance 
halls, and billiard rooms in the cities, and inanition and 
gossip in the country towns. The golden days of 
Greece and the great days of Queen Elizabeth were 
play-acting epochs, and do not seem to have been the 
worse for it. It is true that there were no plays for 
children in the Elizabethan era, and it is a pity that 
there were not. But the children of that time did not 
need them as do the children of to-day. They were 
living in an imaginative age filled with balladry, festi- 
val, and story, with high adventure and marvelous dis- 
coveries on all sides. Life itself was a play, romantic 
and colorful. Compare the life of that time and the 
monotony of our dun city streets, a monotony against 
which youth is in continual revolt. If plays are not 
selected for children, in many instances they will select 
them for themselves. Mrs. Charles Israels says: 
“Most interesting is the change which has come over 
amateur dramatics in young people’s organizations,” 
and quotes the following instances: 
“ Twelve or thirteen years ago, when in charge of
-P-A-G-E-42
  36 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
all the entertainment work at the Educational Alliance 
(New York City), I came in contact with many boys’ 
clubs with dramatic ambitions. Those were the palmy 
days of melodrama at the Third Avenue and the Bow- 
ery Theaters. As soon as a play was produced its story 
was printed in the evening papers with all the original 
dialogue merely connected by a sufficient number of 
“he saids’ and ‘she saids.’ These stories were clipped 
from the papers, pasted into blank-books, and became the 
script from which the play was rehearsed.” 
“ Original plays were written to follow these models, 
and a typical programme offered would consist ‘of a 
play or plays entitled: 
The Bandit’s Revenge. 
The Captain’s Band. 
Guilty, or the Pirate King’s Reward. 
“We introduced new standards, and among the 
plays produced were a version of the courtroom scene 
in Puddinhead Wilson, Men and Women, and many 
home-made versions of fairy tales and children’s verses, 
and stories.” 
To-day, through wise guidance, the same type of club 
may give, as did the boys of South End House, Boston, 
a production of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure 
Island, which combines exciting incident and literary 
quality. 
Tue CuILp-AUDIENCE 
Walt Whitman said, “To have great poets we must 
have great audiences.” The children of to-day will be

PLAYER AND AUDIENCE 37 
the audience of to-morrow. To have great drama we 
must have great audiences. Train the dramatic in- 
stinct of the children of to-day, and the drama of to- 
morrow will be great drama because its audience will 
demand it. In all the schools children are taught the 
poetry of Stevenson and Longfellow in the hope that 
when they are older they will love not only Stevenson 
and Longfellow, but Shelley and Shakespeare. If it 
is worth while to train a child’s literary taste, why is 
it not worth while to train his dramatic taste? Why is 
it not imperative to make him see the difference between 
true and false dramatic values, between the tawdry and 
the beautiful? Watch a child-audience rapt with the 
loveliness and surprise of The Blue Bird, or wide-eyed 
at the fairies in the treetops of Peter Pan. They fave 
entered into their own world. It is as real to them as 
it is fantastic to us. “Is this where the most beautiful 
princess in the world lives?” asks a little girl, peering 
into the door of the Hull House Theater, or “ Does 
Alice in Wonderland always stay here?” 
The love of drama is so deep-rooted a human in- 
stinct that children have it as well as adults. All over 
the country, in city or in village, boys and girls are 
keenly anxious to “ see a show,” when an opportunity 
offers. If no professional plays for children, such as 
Snow White or The Blue Bird, happen to be available, 
they (the children) are taken to vaudeville or comic 
opera. They go, willingly enough. But of the herit- 
age of childhood they receive nothing. ‘They are given 
nothing that they can rightly understand.

In all the large cities children frequent the moving- 
picture shows, and since there are no Children’s 
Moving-Picture Theaters the youthful audience is 
served a dish of lurid melodrama, comic supplement 
humor, or sundry comments on domestic felicity. Chil- 
dren are greatly influenced by what they see in these 
theaters. The night courts devoted to youthful cul- 
prits are filled with echoes of, “I seen it at the moving- 
picture show.” Says an English -playwright, “ The 
theater is literally making the minds of our urban popu- 
lation to-day. It is a huge factory of sentiment, of 
character, of points: of honor, of conceptions of con- 
duct, of everything that finally determines the destiny 
of a nation. The theater is not only a place of amuse- 
ment, it is a place of culture, a place where people 
learn to think, act, and feel.” Especially is this true 
of the large cities. One has only to walk along Four- 
teenth Street near Union Square in New York to see 
hordes of drama-hungry youngsters gazing voraciously 
at the florid signs of the penny arcades and ‘“‘ gem- 
theaters.” One longs to put a wholesome children’s 
theater into this very spot with Robert Louis Steven- 
son’s immortal— 
“Come up here, oh dusty feet, 
Here is fairy bread to eat,” 
painted in larger letters over the door. Dramas might 
be presented here that would send their child-audiences 
out into the dingy thoroughfare fortified with visions

of imaginative beauty. The players might be non- 
professional; the admittance fee within the reach of all. 
And it is an actual fact that children prefer the best 
in drama when it is given to them. They will desert 
cheap melodrama in favor of imaginative drama nine 
times out of ten; and it is a boon beyond estimate that 
they can have the auditoriums of the New York Public 
Schools in which to work out their plays, and in work- 
ing, grow. Nothing is more needed than that our 
public schools should become our community theaters, 
the home of children’s plays the country over. 
Community BENEFIT 
What of the fathers and mothers of the child-play- 
ers? What of their older sisters and brothers? One 
of the greatest things the movement for children’s 
plays has done is the way it has drawn people together. 
In country districts people come for miles to see the 
production of a children’s play. But it is in the city 
that the greatest benefits are derived. A performance 
of one of Shakespeare’s plays on the East Side, by a 
cast of young immigrants, resulted in arousing an inter- 
est in the fathers and mothers who could speak no 
English. The children explained the play to them. 
Cheap editions were bought and read. And presently 
work-worn parents who never stepped beyond their own 
thresholds after nightfall became suddenly eager to see 
what had so enthralled their children. Older brothers 
and sisters went “to find out what the young ones  
-P-A-G-E-46
40 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
were doing.” It was a get-together time for the whole 
neighborhood, a time of family and community pride. 
To quote again from the bulletin of The Educa- 
tional Dramatic League, “To a vast number of people 
the theater is prohibitive in price, but with the players 
drawn from the 700,000 school children of New York, 
all the young wage-earners, and with the free use of 
the school auditoriums, good plays can be produced 
with practically no cost to the community. It will also 
bring into the lives of the fathers and mothers, as 
well as the young people, a wholesome and enjoyable 
social companionship. The work is being carried on 
largely in the congested districts, where the parents of 
the children have little time, and less money for amuse- 
ments. The plays bring recreation nearer to them, 
with the added joy that their children are creating this 
means of pleasure.” Other cities might follow this 
example. 
All of the young players enrolled in the League, 
although they come from different parts of the city, 
genuinely and heartily co-operate with one another. If 
a special or trial performance is coming off, and illness 
of a player threatens to make production impossible, 
offers of assistance from other clubs who are rehearsing 
the same play are immediately made. They cheerfully 
and interestedly help one another, and are glad to 
substitute players, costumes, settings, and properties. 
This is the spirit that a great city needs. “So many 
young people come to New York to start life filled 
with the spirit of love of amusement, and from lack of
-P-A-G-E-47
  PLAYER AND AUDIENCE 41 
knowledge of where and how to obtain it form bad 
habits and make detrimental acquaintances; others who 
move from one community to another feel equally 
adrift.” The League keeps a list of clubs in different 
neighborhoods, so as to be of assistance to those who 
wish to join a club in a given community. This might 
be done elsewhere, in many of our cities. 
Dramatic clubs for children fostered in school or 
settlement carry their impetus far beyond school or 
settlement room. The Educational Dramatic League 
reports a benefit given by children for the Prison Asso- 
ciation. Colored children, under a League director, 
produced a play in their own clubroom, once for their 
mothers, once for the children of the neighborhood. 
Then they went a-field and gave the play at the Lincoln 
Hospital for aged couples and the Colored Orphan 
Asylum. This is an idea containing distinct community 
benefit. 
Our public schools as community theaters can be and 
should be a socializing force for player, for audience, 
for community at large. | The more difficult the task, 
“the more,” as Jane Addams says, “ does the effort 
need help and direction, both in the development of 
its technique and the material of its themes. The few 
attempts that have been made in this direction are 
astonishingly rewarding to those who regard the power 
of self-expression as one of the most precious boons of 
education.”

HOW TO PRODUCE CHILDREN’S 
PLAYS 
Tue director of a children’s play stands to the chil- 
dren in the relation that the director of an orchestra 
does to his players. It is the business of the director 
of the orchestra to control and guide, to see that the 
violins shimmer and the ’cellos throb at the right mo- 
ment. He must bring the utmost out of the players 
as individuals, and of the orchestra as a whole. He 
must interpret the symphony as the musician who wrote 
it intended it should be interpreted. ‘This is also the 
task of the director of children’s plays, who must bring 
out all the sweetness, the unconscious grace, and child- 
like charm of the child-players, and yet keep to the 
original purpose of the playwright. ‘The director 
must know the play backward and forward, must recog- 
nize the points to be emphasized, and move toward the 
climax with a sharp or gradual crescendo as the play 
demands. 
Every play, long or short, has its rhythm, just as 
music has. There is not only the rhythm of the whole 
play, but a rhythm for each act, and innumerable 
crescendos and diminuendos. These signs guide the 
42
-P-A-G-E-49
CHILDREN’S PLAYS 43 
orchestra, and it is the greatest pity that there are no: 
signs to guide the director of children’s plays. If one 
could only say, “Fast here. Slow here. Wistful 
lightness here,” and so on, what wonders might not be 
accomplished. The children’s playwright could indi- 
cate largo, presto, and grazioso with a happy hand! 
But since no play signs exist, the director must gather 
as much as possible from a thorough reading of the 
text and play directions. One of the greatest faults 
of the average play given. by amateurs, whether adults 
or children, is the slowness of its tempo. A’ remedy 
for this will be discussed later on. 
‘The orchestra director may select a whole symphony, 
or a programme of short pieces. The play director may 
choose a long or a short children’s play. If a short 
play is chosen, and only runs twenty minutes when 
you meant it to run half an hour, or when it runs 
twenty-five minutes when you meant it to run forty, 
do not lengthen it by devices of your own. Better 
a programme of two or even three one-act plays than 
that utter abomination, “a short play made long 
enough.” Better something brief and exquisite than 
something long and patchy. We all know the type of 
dramatic entertainment that is “‘ good in spots,” like 
the unhappy curate’s soft-boiled egg. A children’s 
play is not a minstrel show. It does not need inter- 
polations. To put in an “ extra” dance or song often 
destroys its symmetry. You do not lengthen a sona- 
tina by devices of your own; why lengthen a children’s 
play? ‘Trust the author. The chances are that if he
-P-A-G-E-50
  44 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
wrote the play he knows as much and perhaps even a 
little more than the producer who is directing it for 
the first time. 
A good test of a play is its suitability for all occa- 
sions. Between a stage-play and a school play should 
lie only the difference of environment. A school play 
should contain such simple elemental dramatic values 
that, if suddenly transplanted to the stage, it would 
still retain them. A stage-play for child-audiences 
that cannot be stripped of its ornamental trappings 
without losing its charm for schoolroom audiences is 
fundamentally not a play for children. Jessie Braham 
White’s version of Snow White as produced by Win- 
throp Ames is an example in point. With its beauti- 
fully simple scenery and costumes it was a delightful 
thing for children to see on the professional stage; yet 
read, not even acted in a New York schoolroom, it 
proved enthralling to an audience of children who had 
never seen it on the stage., 
Of late years, since plays for children have become 
part of the school curriculum, standards of produc- 
tion are being raised. Plays for children are no longer 
chosen at haphazard. They must have a certain ethical 
and literary value. The time has come when child- 
drama is as carefully selected as children’s music. The 
best music teachers will not tolerate trashy ragtime. 
The best producers of children’s plays will not tolerate 
vapid drama and slovenly enunciation. Besides exer- 
cising more care in play selection, the world at large 
has come to realize that play-producing is an art in
-P-A-G-E-51
  
CHILDREN’S PLAYS 45 
itself, and play-producing for children a very delicate 
and subtle one. Child-drama should have lines as 
straight and delicate as a Boutet de Monvel painting. 
Everything should be naive and simple, and yet the 
production should have the art which conceals art. 
The first thing to do in producing a children’s play 
is to ask yourself questions, and their answer will 
naturally help you to decide what sort of play you wish 
to undertake, long or short, simple or complex, though 
if children have never acted before, it is well to begin 
with a short one. Is it to be in the country or city? 
Indoors or out of doors? For a school or settlement? 
Is the cast to be large or small? All boys? All girls? 
Or girls and boys? Do you wish to produce the play 
for the sheer joy of doing something that will have 
artistic and educational value? Is it to celebrate some 
national holiday? Or is it part of a pedagogical 
scheme? Is it to be given as a means of raising money 
for some school or settlement? In which case you must 
perforce make a good showing, and give the kingliest 
boy the kingliest part. Or are you free to give the 
most round-shouldered boy the kingliest part to make 
him hold himself erect? Will it be possible to train 
two casts so that both kirigly and round-shouldered 
boys can have a chance at it? For this is the ideal 
way. Always train two casts when possible. One 
supplements the other. ‘Then, what sort of a play are 
you going to give? A modern play? A fairy play? 
An historical play, or a nature play? 
If expensive, or the most inexpensive costumes are
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
_ out of the question, choose a modern play, and let the 
children wear their everyday clothes. A national holi- 
day calls for a play that is appropriate to the time. If 
your players have been studying Lincoln, why not give 
a Lincoln play? .A nature play suggests itself as fitted 
for a camp; a morality play is good for a guild, or for 
the Lenten season; while for almost all occasions, in- 
doors or out, that hardy perennial, the fairy play, can 
be depended on. Emigrant and native-born children 
enjoy them equally. ‘“‘ Fairy tales,” says Gilbert Ches- 
terton, “are our only democratic institution: all the 
classes have read all the fairy tales.” 
While. it is not always wise to leave the entire 
selection of a play to children, never force a play on 
them. They must have delight and pride in what 
they do or it avails them nothing. ‘Take something 
suited to their environment and temperament. Above 
all, select something that is too difficult rather than 
something too easy: children despise what they feel is 
\ beneath their powers. For the “ gang,” eager for ex- 
‘citement, no quiet play will do: a rousing patriotic 
play, something that centers about a hero, or a play 
with Indians in it, makes a strong appeal to the gang 
spirit. Boy Scouts are Keen for plays of the open: 
something that suggests the camp fire or the trail. For 
Camp Fire Girls, plays of Indian legends, or pioneer 
life are appropriate. Boys in a country school are also 
eager to act Indian or pioneer plays; while for country 
girls the fairy play is best to begin with. The country 
child lacks imagination. Country life is usually a life
-P-A-G-E-53
  CHILDREN’S PLAYS 47 
of fact. There are no fairies out beneath the moon: 
no dryads in the trees; no river spirits in the brooks. 
Therefore, country children. need fantastic plays. For 
emigrant children who speak little English, try a folk- 
play of their own nation, put into English words. It 
will give them an idea of the value of the arts of their 
own land. If their parents come to see it they can 
probably understand a part, at least, of what is going 
on, and it will be a bond drawing the family together. 
If, as sometimes happens, you have a group of girls 
of varying ages, the youngest seven, the oldest thirteen 
or fourteen, try a morality play in which the char- 
acters have no particular age, when they represent quali- 
ties rather than personalities. For a boys’ or girls’ 
camp use a nature play that will carry with it some 
knowledge of woodcraft or animal lore. For the 
settlement, the camp, or garden, a fairy play comes into 
use. It is also the best play to use for defectives. 
Plays with an outdoor setting should be produced in 
the tenement districts where the people-who-have-too- 
little forget what trees and grass look like, forget the 
beauty of forest-green. 
Whatever play you select, be sure of three things: 
that it has literary quality, dramatic quality, and that 
it contains an idea. By literary quality is meant that 
the language should be poetic. There is no benefit in 
the memorizing of commonplace lines. By dramatic \ 
quality is meant that the play should have an interest- | 
ing plot, with a climax. Lack of climax, or culminat- 
‘ing point, is the lack of most children’s plays. That 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
48 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
the play should contain an idea means that it should ; 
teach some dominant truth either subtly or openly. It LY 
may be either the great lesson of courage in adverse cir- 
cumstances, or the simple lesson that happiness, like , 
the Blue Bird, can be found at home. 
The range of emotion in child-drama is, of course, 
restricted: such things as money-lust, power-lust, vice, 
social ambition, despair, or trickiness do not exist for 
normal aes, They are beyond their range. 
Neither should children’s plays contain love-making 
or sentiment. In acting such scenes they are merely 
aping emotions that they have never felt, and acting 
for children should be as direct and sincere as it is 
possible to make it. It should carry with it a dis- 
tinct atmosphere of simplicity and candor. There 
should be no straining after effect, no appeal that does 
not spring directly from the heart. The child should 
be expressing his or her inward self—not acting, in the 
adult sense of the word. For this reason the characters 
which children represent should be those of a common 
and deep humanity. It would be ideal if children 
could always act characters of their own years, whose 
feelings they could at once appreciate. But since this 
is not always possible thee other folk who figure so 
largely in children’s plays—quaint fairies, peasants, 
trolls, woodcutters, and the like—should have that 
artlessness that is akin to the artlessness of child- 
hood. 
Suppose the play is chosen, and the director ready to A i \ rehearse it. Gather the children together and set  \ \

  CHILDREN’S, PLAYS 49 
the dates for the rehearsals, so that there can be no mis- 
take, no excuses about attending. Find out the after- 
noons or early evenings that are nearest to suiting 
- everybody. No hard and fast rule for the number of 
rehearsals required can be given here. Twenty re- 
hearsals should suffice for a somewhat long and com- 
plex play, with a month to six weeks to rehearse it in. 
Ten rehearsals, undertaken in three weeks to a month, 
should suffice for a one-act play; but, of course, all 
depends on the mental equipment of the players. Too 
long a time in play preparation “stales” the players. | 
They lose their interest. For little children rehearsing | 
should not occupy more than two weeks, and the play | 
should be very short. Length of rehearsal hours’ differs 
according to the ages of the players. For those in the 
grammar grades an hour and a half at a time should 
be the most. If attention seems to flag, and the chil- 
dren are tired, it will often be advisable to shorten 
the time. For little children half-hour rehearsals are | 
sufficient. And for children from eight to eleven yet } 
old an hour’s rehearsal is sufficient. 
The final or dress rehearsal will always be longer 
than any of the others, and in setting a date for it, 
extra time must be allowéuy particularly in the case of 
a long play. Three rehearsals a week make a whole- 
some average. But the director must judge about this, 
using tact and common sense in all things, and avoid- 
ing strain to the players. \ 
As has been suggested, if the children have never 
acted before, begin with a simple play, preferably in
-P-A-G-E-56
  50 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
one act. And whether children have ever acted before 
or not, the method of producing the play is exactly 
the same; for, like everything else in the world, play- 
producing for children has a right way and a wrong 
way, a way that leads nowhere and a way that makes 
for genuine accomplishment. : 
There are two ways of selecting the cast. First, 
competitive choice; second, having the cast chosen by 
the director. In competitive choice, a selection from 
the play is read by all the children in rotation. The 
one that puts the most fervor or imagination into the 
reading of the lines is, by general vote, selected for 
the leading part. Then the one to fill the next part 
is chosen. The most important parts are filled first; 
then the less important. It is made clear to the play- 
ers that merit decides the choice. If two casts are 
trained, the players who have the most important parts 
in the first cast are given the least important parts in 
the second cast. This serves two purposes. It gives all 
the players a chance, and prepares for any emergency 
that may arise. If one player is ill on the eve of per- 
formance, another can take his place. Moreover, it 
develops discipline. If a player knows that slackness. 
or inattention on his part will result in another player’s 
having it, he sets himself more ardently to the task in 
hand. If the children are undisciplined, have it under- 
stood that two absences from rehearsal without suffi- 
cient excuse will debar them from the part originally, 
assigned. 
When the cast is chosen by the director let the
-P-A-G-E-57
  CHILDREN’S PLAYS 51 
children understand from the first that they are to 
abide by that choice. If the director apportions the 
parts according to remedial reasons, see that the slug- 
gishly inclined children have brisk parts, that the shy 
child has something appealing to say and do, that 
the bumptious, forward child plays a character who 
is controlled and quiet. Unless there is some ex- 
ceedingly good reason for it, do not deviate when once 
the parts have been assigned. If some of the children 
are to be put in charge of the properties, scenery, or\ 
lighting, select children on whom you can depend, dis- 
cuss and apportion their duties at this first- meeting. 
If properties must be madé, all the children in the cast 
must agree to help. It will be well to set a date when, 
they will meet and make them. ; 
r As soon as all the parts are assigned, have the chil-| 
dren read the play aloud in rotation, each child read- 
ing when the character assigned to him begins to speak. 
This is the time when faults in pronunciation, in dic-\ 
tion, in sing-songiness can be broken. Accustom them 
from the first to the right way of doing things. It is 
easier to be correct from the first than to hark back and 
undo what has already been done. If a child reads a 
line incorrectly more than once it is apt to become a 
habit. If the children make the character they are in- 
terpreting speak in a peculiar way, ask them why they 
do it. Get at their reasons. Show them logically why 
another way might be better, or why their way is good. — 
Discuss the play and its characters as they go. A good — 
deal has been said nowadays about letting children 
     
-P-A-G-E-58
  52 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
interpret their own ideas of a character. This is an 
excellent thing, stimulating alike the player and direc- 
tor. But it can be carried too far. A child may often 
interpret a character wrongly. We do not expect a 
child to interpret music entirely as to his own ideas, 
pedaling when he pleases, playing pianissimo or forte, 
as the spirit moves him. All character interpretation 
should be subject to the molding influence of class dis- 
cussion and the analysis of the play. For, after the 
play has been read once around by the cast it is time 
for one of the’ most important parts of play-producing 
to begin: namely, yplay analysis. This ‘means a full 
discussion of all- the points of the play, an example of 
which is given in the next chapter. 
Discussion, ‘analysis, and play-reading will probably 
occupy the first two rehearsals of a one-act play; but 
at the close of. the first rehearsal have the players 
derstand that at the third rehearsal they are to be 
’ Tetter-perfect in. their lines, and that no actual acting 
will occur until this has been accomplished. Thus 
any child who lags in fulfilling this duty is made to 
realize that he or she is holding back all the rest, and 
the general eagerness to “ begin to act the story” will 
wing their memories as nothing else can. 
The third rehearsal is a line rehearsal. That is, a 
rehearsal for lines only. Have them go through the 
play from memory twice, prompting only when abso- 
lutely necessary. ‘The first time they may go slowly, 
so as to correct mistakes, and the second time briskly, 
as if the actual performance were going on, Correct 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
CHILDREN’S PLAYS 53 
here, suggest there. Have them from the first take 
up their cues with the utmost celerity. If all is not as 
it should be, never make a child nervous by nagging. 
Tell him that his interpretation will do for the pres- 
ent, and then work with him a little after the others 
have gone. Or have him come early at the following 
rehearsal. Encouragement and praise will do wonders 
for a backward, nervous child. ‘The director should 
recognize effort and the will to do, no matter how 
cloaked or hidden by inability or mistakes, At the end 
of this third rehearsal take up a little of the actual 
acting, so that the children will not, think you are too 
long in getting to the “ fun” of the play. 
Rough out the whole play at the next rehearsal, so 
that the players will have an idea of what it is going 
to be. Have the players move quickly and quietly 
through their exits and entrances, and know their 
positions on the stage. Begin to work with properties 
from the first, so that the players will become accus- 
tomed to them. If a basket of fruit or a fairy wand is 
to be used, have them on hand. It does not matter if 
the basket of fruit is a grape basket filled with rubber 
balls, and the wand a blackboard pointer or cane. The 
easy use of them is the thing to be gained. Do not be 
discouraged if this rehearsal does not come up to your 
expectations. Remember that it is only in the rough. 
At the next rehearsal begin to mold the performance. 
See that the right points are emphasized. Repeat 
scenes till they have the finish which they ought to 
have. Be sure that your rehearsals are taking place in
-P-A-G-E-60
  54 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
a room of the right size; that is, a size as nearly like 
the stage where the play will actually be performed as 
possible. Too cramped a room will make all the mo- 
tions of the children cramped, and to rehearse in too 
large a room when the stage is to be smaller will con- 
fuse them dreadfully. If you must rehearse in a room 
that is either too large or too small, try to have one 
early rehearsal on the stage where the play will finally 
be given, and let the children make allowances for 
space in their later work, This is one of the most try- 
ing things that directors have to deal with, Always 
rehearse on the stage that will be used on the final day, 
if possible. 
At the fifth or sixth rehearsal, if you are training 
two casts, one cast can watch another cast at work. 
Do not permit whispering or sotto voce remarks while 
rehearsals are going on by those who are not rehearsing. 
Sound and movement are distressing to those who are 
trying to do their best. This is another rule that 
should be understood from the first. 
If the play happens to have a large number of 
supernumeraries (players whose presence is necessary 
to the play, but who have few or no lines) have a re- 
hearsal for them alone. Don’t let them stand idly on 
your stage, staring blankly at the audience. If they are 
fairies, see that they form exquisite fairy-like groups. 
If they are to form a still background, see that they are 
well posed and natural. Give them comfortable posi- 
tions that they can hold easily. If they are to form an 
animated background, give them plenty of stage busi-
-P-A-G-E-61
  CHILDREN’S PLAYS 55 
ness, i.e., silent action or pantomime. Let them sug- 
gest as much of the stage business as possible. Suppose 
it is a market scene. Have them buying and selling. 
Have the driving of hard bargains going on in the 
background, while the main characters talk in the fore- 
ground. But if something unusually exciting is occur- 
ring to the main characters, then have all the buyers 
and sellers crowding up on tiptoe with curiosity, with 
gaping “ What is this?” or with head-wagging of 
“T told you this might be expected!” In other words, 
have your play instinct with vitality. Have it like life. 
If you find the supernumeraries do not do good panto- 
mime work, put lines into their mouths. Have them 
rehearse with these lines spoken aloud at first, and later 
spoken silently, only the lips moving. This method 
will be found very useful. It helps many children to 
keep from appearing wooden. It also gives them a feel- 
ing that their part is worth while. The good work of 
the principal players is often rendered less effective by 
the lifeless quality of the supernumeraries. Make the 
supernumeraries feel that they are needed and they 
will respond. They are the accompaniment of the 
theme carried by the principals, and as necessary to the 
play as bass notes to a piece of music. Their action is 
necessary to the completeness of the play. And it is 
perhaps at this juncture that the amateur director 
should be warned of the pitfalls of dragging action. 
Just because some of the action of the supernumer- 
aries happens to be amusing or picturesque, don’t give 
too much of it. Then it drags. Make it swift, clear, 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  56 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
and pictorial. Do not let it encroach on the work of 
the main players. Do not over-emphasize it. If there 
is a humorous bit of by-play, do not repeat it. The 
second time it will fall flat. 
Put the supernumeraries and principals through a re- 
hearsal after you have rehearsed the supernumeraries 
alone, and note the difference. Never have the super- ~ 
numeraries come to a rehearsal where they are not 
needed. Get on without them unless their presence is 
absolutely necessary: for many children find it dis- 
couraging to come when they have nothing to do. 
Have a rehearsal for scene-setting and lighting, if 
your scene-setter and property man are chosen from the 
children themselves. | Of course this scene-setting and 
lighting may not involve more than seeing that .a 
drapery of curtains is right, and that chairs and tables 
can be put in their proper places without too much 
noise and confusion. If there is a good deal of furni- 
ture to be moved, assign certain pieces of it to cer- 
tain young scene-shifters, and this will lessen any con- 
fusion. See if they cannot make as few motions as 
possible in coming and going and placing the various 
things that are needed. Have the head scene-shifter 
keep a list of what is needed, and have a duplicate 
yourself. Use this same idea with the properties. If 
lighting involves seeing that a red bulb is turned on 
for a hearth-light effect, or simply the closing of shut; 
ters to darken the assembly-room, see that it is done 
promptly. Make someone responsible for it. 
By the eighth rehearsal have the players go through aw 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  CHILDREN’S PLAYS S7: 
the play entirely on their own responsibility with the 
director sitting in front as audience, quietly jotting 
down with pencil and paper any mistakes which need to 
be rectified. Do not interrupt the play with objections. 
Let it go straight ahead. Prompt the players when 
necessary. When the rehearsal is over, praise the 
good points; deal lightly with its faults, unless they 
are glaring ones. Suggest a few things that need 
remedying. Also, while the rehearsal is in progress, 
see if the tempo drags. Are the cues taken up too 
slowly? This is one of the greatest faults of amateur 
productions. If the cues are taken up too slowly, time 
your play while the players are acting it. Suppose it 
takes thirty-eight minutes when it should take thirty. 
To pull up the tempo, make them race through it at 
breakneck speed for a single time, not acting, just 
saying the lines, and getting through with it in twenty- 
six or twenty-seven minutes. This will often prove of 
first aid to injured tempo. ‘ 
By your tenth or dress rehearsal of a one-act play, 
everything should be in readiness. Set the hour of re- 
hearsal half an hour earlier than the time when you 
really expect to begin. Getting into costumes and the 
general flurry and excitement always cause delay. 
The dress rehearsal should, if possible, take place two 
days before the performance, so as to leave a margin 
for rest, or final touches. Criticise sharply at this per- 
formance all that needs criticising. 
Now comes performance. If the director is to have 
a large or critical audience, and is nervous over the
-P-A-G-E-64
  58 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
final result, do not let the players know it. Encourage 
them. Praise them. Stimulate them to do their best, 
and then let the curtain rise. Never sit out in the 
audience. Always be behind the scenes, ready for an 
emergency. Play a part yourself, if necessary. See 
that absolute quiet is maintained behind the scenes, and 
that the prompter is ready, prompt-book in hand. 
Warn your players that if their lines raise laughter or | 
applause, they are to wait until the laughter or ap- 
plause has subsided, and then continue as if ore 
had happened. 
All this is for the one-act play. If the children are 
taking part in a three- or four-act play, first analyze 
the whole play, so they can have an idea of it in its 
entirety, its story, and its meaning. Then go back. 
Read the first act in rotation, learn its lines, and. be- 
gin a roughed-in rehearsal. By the time the rehearsal 
of the first act is being roughed in, begin work on the 
second act, reading, learning its lines, and roughing 
it in, as has been the case with the first act. When 
it is learned, lessen the rehearsals of the first act, and 
put in more time on the second act. As soon as your 
second act is being roughed out, swoop to your third 
act, and rehearse that twice as hard as you do your sec- 
ond act. A rough first act and an uneven second act 
are not as bad as a ragged, half-worked last act. It is 
better to begin less well and go up than to begin finely 
and come down. Put especial stress on the climax of 
your play. This must come out clearly, whatever else 
happens. But the whole thing should run as smoothly
-P-A-G-E-65
  
  CHILDREN’S PLAYS 59 
as possible. Catch the rhythm of it, if you can, though 
a feeling for rhythm in a play only comes with prac- 
tice in producing. Be especially careful of the tempo 
of your last act. See that the play is not “ spotty,” 
good and then less good throughout. ‘ 
For an outdoor play have the children rehearse in- 
doors first. Select your play site carefully. If pos- 
sible, have it so that the sun does not shine directly in 
the faces of the players. After you have had two or 
three indoor rehearsals, take your play into the open. 
See that the voices carry clearly, and that the panto- 
mime is effective. Step off to where the last row of 
the audience is to sit, and judge this for yourself. Re- 
member that outdoor work can be broader than indoor 
work. As much detail is not necessary for it. 
Remember that when you are producing a children’s 
play you are setting a standard. Whether that stand- 
ard is bad or good will rest far more with you, the 
director, than the child-players whom you guide and 
control. 
ScHOOLROOM PropUCTIONS 
A word should be said here about schoolroom pro- 
ductions, where scenery or even curtains cannot usu- 
ally be had, and where the money for properties and 
costumes is usually nil. A play-production in a school 
auditorium is one thing; but all schools do not have 
auditoriums and a schoolroom production calls for 
great ingenuity if it is to carry with an atmosphere of 
reality or fantasy. It need hardly be said that for the
-P-A-G-E-66
  60 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
production of children’s plays as wide a use as possible 
should be made of the school auditorium. If the school 
is in the country or suburbs, it is often possible to 
give a play out of doors. But what of the city or small 
town school, with no chance of either auditorium or 
outdoor production? The best thing that can be done 
in this case is to utilize the material at hand in the most 
imaginative manner possible. Use the space in front 
of the desks for an indoor play or a play that does 
not require much action. For a play that must have 
space, in which there is action that must have free 
play, why not utilize the whole schoolroom? 
A whole schoolroom as a stage was used in one of 
the public schools of New York City in a very won- 
derful way. ‘The children, with the help of their 
teacher, had constructed a simple play from Frances 
Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden, the story hav- 
ing been read aloud in the schoolroom before actual 
dramatization began. The scenes of the play were laid 
partly indoors and partly out of doors. The indoor 
scenes were acted in the space in front of the desks, 
which became a room, with the teacher’s desk and 
chair as part of its furniture, while the garden was 
represented by the desk space and the desks, the garden 
being the aisles between the desks! And how was the 
feeling of the garden given? For weeks beforehand 
. the boys and girls had been making tissue-paper flowers. 
They were fastened to stems and branches and lay on 
the desks in front of the players. As soon as the char- 
acters in the play stepped from the house into the gar-
-P-A-G-E-67
CHILDREN’S PLAYS 61 
den, the players at the desks slowly raised and waved 
the flowers that lay in front of them. They were 
mostly pink and white blossoms, with here and there a 
touch of blue and pale gold—for the children had been 
reading what flowers would be likely to grow in an 
English garden. 
And suddenly the everyday schoolroom was trans- 
formed, flooded with color and blossom. But more 
than this. The boys had been practicing bird calls! 
The moment the flowers were raised and the garden 
bloomed, there came a shrill, sweet chorus of black- 
bird whistles, robin notes, a lilt from the thrush, and 
a dozen other twitterings that the boys had learned 
from someone who visited a settlement in their neigh- 
borhood. The schoolroom was a garden for the time 
being! And the children whose only playground was 
the city streets were transported to “ England in the 
springtime,’ where hawthorn bloomed and_robins 
sang! And there was utility as well as ideality, for 
later on the same flowers were used for a spring festival. 
The whole production of the play was a triumph of 
mind over matter. It represented a miracle that could 
be worked by any other teacher who uses her imagina- 
tion, and induces her pupils to cultivate theirs. They 
had learned about English gardens, about flowers, and 
about birds. Somehow, as one thinks of it, is there not 
at once something valiant and pathetic in the thought of 
city sparrows, many of whom had never seen a garden, 
joyously imitating blither songbirds whose days are 
spent in free, sweet meadows, under blossoming boughs!

Tue Makinc or ProcRAMMES 
The making of programmes requires care. Repeat- 
ing an effect or an idea should be avoided. If three 
plays of the same period are used they should show 
varying aspects of that period. All things considered, 
in dealing with historical plays, it is wiser to put them 
chronologically. 
Usually it is safest to put your shortest play first, 
and your longest play last. Try to place your most 
finished bit of work at the end, where it will be twice 
as telling as at the beginning. 
If you are producing two fairy plays, have them on 
different themes. If you are producing two plays at 
Christmas, have one modern and the other a costume 
play. There is a lift to costume plays for amateurs 
that modern plays do not have. A programme of one- 
act plays might consist of one folk play and one history 
play; or a modern play and a fairy play. A humorous 
play should come first and an idyllic play last in a 
programme where both are combined. If you are giv- 
ing a curtain-raiser to a little two- or three-act fairy 
play have something modern or a nature play for your 
shorter piece. 
It is a good idea for groups of settlements, or for 
different grades in a public school to study a one-act 
play or episode. If there are ten or twelve of such 
episodes a pageant can be formed at the end of the 
year. Have your play appropriate to its season. Do 
not have a play from which your audience can gain no

pleasure. Do not expect them to like the classical at 
first sight. You will probably have to begin with 
something light or amusing. 
Wuat 1s NEEDED FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE 
CuHILpREN’s PLay MoveMENT 
A higher and more imaginative standard in plays 
throughout the country. 
Greater care and knowledge used in play-production 
as regards simple scenery, costumes, and properties. 
A wider use of the school auditorium as a benefit to 
the community. 
The use of plays in country schools as related not 
only to the school, but to the life of the community. 
The utilization of material at hand, such as open-air 
plays on the common or village green instead of in a 
stuffy schoolroom. The use of unoccupied barns for 
children’s community theaters in summer; of the town 
hall for the same purpose in winter. 
A greater interchange between public school, social 
settlement, church guild, and social center. In the 
children’s play movement there is already discernible 
a certain waste of effort and of art. A children’s play 
is made to serve one purpose when it ought to serve 
ten. Usually a play is given once or twice in a settle- 
ment or school, and there is an end of it. What could 
be done is this: the play might be given in the school 
before an audience of children, then before an audience 
of fathers and mothers. Then it might be taken to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
64 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
nearest settlement and repeated there, to the nearest 
church guild and repeated there. What about other 
places to which it might be giving joy? What about 
homes for the aged? What about orphan asylums? 
Children’s wards in hospitals? What about utiliz- 
ing a hall in or near a factory? The play movement is 
doing a great deal, but not half what it might. The 
children in district X go to the settlement in district 
X, and to the school in district X. Why not inter- 
change with their plays? 
The social settlements of Boston interchange plays 
and players with splendid results. All the thought and 
effort that go to the directing of a play might be 
made to serve a number of communities instead of one, 
and much social waste could be avoided. Interchange 
in the large cities would do a great deal toward draw- 
ing the vast conglomerate mass together. 
It is a pity that a simple outdoor stage, such as is 
used in Palermo and other Italian cities, could not be 
utilized in tenement districts. It somewhat resembles 
the floats that were used in medieval miracle plays 
and pageants, only it is smaller, and has two screens 
for wings. This stage could be set up in a city street 
and plays could thus be acted out of doors. 
All schools, settlements, and guilds should own their 
own stage equipment. The children should be taught 
to take delight in adding to the collection of scenery, 
properties, and costumes. The boys who take manual 
training can make the furniture. The girls can learn 
to make simple costumes, and to dye them.

PLAY ANALYSIS FOR CHILDREN 
Two short plays and suggestions for their analysis are 
given in this chapter, so that teachers and amateur di- 
rectors may use them as a basis for analyzing other 
plays for children. The first is a very simple dramatiza- 
tion of Browning’s Pied Piper for the lower grades 
and younger children, and the second, for the gram- 
mar grades and older children, is Christina Rossetti’s 
Pageant of Months. ‘There are several reasons for 
this choice. One of them is that the Pied Piper and the 
Pageant of Months can be found in any public library, 
and so are easily available for teachers and students. 
Another reason is that in learning their lines the chil- 
dren will be absorbing the best literature. In the little 
dramatization of Browning’s poem only two of the 
lines are not his. All the rest have been taken directly 
from the poem. Moreover, these two selections repre- 
sent two types of drama: the first is full of action and 
has a definite plot and climax, while the second is static 
and appeals through the beauty of its unusualness and 
the charm of its lines. It should be kept in mind that 
beauty is not always requisite for a play; but it is 
requisite for a pageant. Also the Pied Piper uses a 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  66 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
great many characters, and has what might in a small 
way be termed “ mass effect,” while the Pageant of 
Months depends on individual acting. In the Pied 
Piper the supernumeraries and what they do are as im- 
portant to the action of the play as was the chorus to 
the old Greek drama. In the Pageant of Months 
there are no supernumeraries.

END OF PLAY 
Discuss the kind of person each character is, and his 
or her relation to the play, when necessary. 
Evidently the play begins in a square, so we can 
give the play indoors in winter or outdoors in sum- 
mer. In the summer have a place with grass and 
trees, or screens built of branches. In the winter, 
green hangings and pine trees. Or a city street. (See 
chapter on Scenery.) And then there-would be market 
stalls. How could they be made? Just ordinary 
wooden boxes could be made to do, and on them put 
cheese and butter boxes. Then there would be apples, 
and some bright colored vegetables like carrots, and 
perhaps a small keg of herring. . What other things 
would there be? Wouldn’t covering a round wooden 
butter-box or even a small- collar-box with orange- 
yellow tissue paper make it look like a huge cheese? 
And how would a cradle be made? (See Properties.) 
So much for the scene-setting. Now for the cos- 
tumes? 
What kind of clothes would they wear in the four- 
teenth century? Who can tell? What was the style 
of their dress? They wove and spun their own ma- 
terial, did they not? What would these materials be?

Didn’t the children wear high-waisted little dresses, 
with straight skirts and white muslin caps or coifs? 
What did the Mayor wear? Read the text. Who 
gave him this ermine cloak? How shall we make it? 
(See chapter on Costuming.) The Piper’s costume is 
described, his cloak was half red and half yellow. The 
other people must have worn clothes of a solid color 
or they wouldn’t have been so surprised at his. 
Now the Rats. What will they wear? Were they 
all in black? Read the text, and see what their names 
are. That will help you decide. Suppose they use 
muslin for their costumes, and have masks of the same 
color for their faces, and caps with ears. And whiskers, 
and tails. 
Now the play has begun and the people have come in. 
How will Abraham walk? Why? What will Justina: 
do when the rats run in and her old grandmother can-< 
not get away? Won't she try and shield her grand- 
mother, half bending over her? It would seem so. 
How will the travelers look? Will they have packs 
on their backs? How will they act when they hear 
about the rats? Won’t they want to run away? Ah, 
but word has come that the Mayor is coming. The 
travelers will want to stay and see what the man who 
tules this rat-haunted town looks like. 
And how does the Mayor act? What sort of a 
man is he? Read the text. He is a little sorry for 
himself, isn’t he? The people are not glad to see him, 
evidently. How would he look as he came toward 
them? Wouldn’t he be looking shiftily from right

to left? And when they menace him wouldn’t he 
hold a cloak in front of his face? And what makes 
him lower it? The sound of a tap. Only it wasn’t 
a tap. It was music. And now we behold the Pied 
Piper. What does Pied mean? Do the people feel 
that this man is strange? What does old Abraham say? 
Does the Piper’s speech make him seem like one of 
themselves, or stranger still? How could he go to 
so many far-off countries in a short space of time? 
Do you think he flew on his magic cloak? Did you 
ever hear that red was the color for magicians to wear? 
It was the hue of magic. But the Piper’s cloak is half 
red only. Ah, maybe that means he is half magic and 
half human. What sort of a man do you think he is? 
He tells about himself quite ‘frankly, doesn’t he? 
Where he has been, what he has done, and what he can 
do. He comes to the point at once. Would you say 
he was honest, and trustworthy? 
‘What does the Mayor say? 
And what does the Piper say to that? Oh, he will 
show them. He won’t just talk about it. What sort 
of a man does that make him out to be? Now the 
people have all followed the Piper off the scene, except 
Justina and her grandmother. And Justina cannot 
help looking to see what is happening! And what does 
she see? It would seem that the Piper is stranger than 
ever! And what do we hear? The first notes of his 
piping. 
Now Justina and her grandmother have gone, and 
what has happened? What the Piper said has come true!

The rats are coming out of their holes. What seems 
to be the chief characteristic of the rats from their 
conversation? They are gluttons. Isn’t that why we 
despise them so? 
Back comes the Piper. The rats have followed him 
away. And now the people gather excitedly to tell 
each other the news. Is their first thought to thank 
or to praise the Piper? Do they seem to be grateful? 
What do they say? And then the Piper comes back 
for his pay. And what does he say? He asks for his 
money. This is one of the really exciting moments in 
the play. Will the Mayor give it or won’t he? Do 
you think the Piper doubts that he will get it? Honest 
people expect others to be like themselves, do they not? 
‘The Mayor takes counsel with his two followers from 
the Corporation. What sort of men are they? Read 
the text. You can judge them by what they say. 
What do the people do? Do they urge the Mayor to 
pay at once? Is the Piper angry? What does he 
say? Read the text. 
What does the Mayor reply? 
You will notice that now the Piper does what is 
characteristic of him. He does not talk. He acts. 
What does he do? Do you think that his telling the 
children a story makes him:seem even more wonderful 
to them? Why? 
What do the people do when they see the children 
following the Piper? 
Does anyone think of calling the Piper back and 
offering him the money?
-P-A-G-E-91
PLAY ANALYSIS 85 
Why were the townsfolk unable to move their feet, 
do you think? What was it held them? Was it a 
spell? Why should it begin just as the children were 
leaving, and stop when the children entered the moun- 
tain, and the door was closed? 
What did the Mayor do? What sort of a man does 
this make him out to be? Was he fit to be Mayor? 
Were any of the townspeople any fitter? 
How do you suppose they knew that the children 
were gone forever? Did they feel it in their guilty 
hearts? What does the end of the play say about 
keeping promises? What else does the play teach? 
Doesn’t it teach that if all the people of a town or 
a nation love gold too much that they may lose some- 
thing better than gold? The children may now begin 
to learn the lines of the play by heart. 
For an analysis of The Pageant of Months first 
read the Pageant aloud, and note that The Pageant of 
Months cannot rightly be termed a play. It has no 
climax or culminating point, and tells no definite 
story. It is rather a series of pictures and of moods. 
It does not hold one between fear and hope. It 
arouses only gentle expectation. It cannot be termed 
“dramatic” in the usual sense of the word. But it 
does interest us through its sheer beauty; and it gives 
us an enlivened sense of the change and color of the 
year. This is its central theme, or idea. 
If The Pageant of Months is to be given by a cast 
of boys and girls, divide them into the groups indi-    
-P-A-G-E-92
  
  86 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
cated in the Pageant. Since the months have no par- 
ticular sex, changes can be made if the cast has more 
boys than girls, or vice versa. 
Suppose the play has been read around by the class. 
What are you going to do for your scene-setting? 
What the scene-set really requires is a divided stage, 
with the wall of the cottage running down the center. 
One half of the stage will thus be the interior of the 
cottage, and one half will be the cottage’s open grounds. 
This is impossible except for expensive stage equip- 
ment. Therefore, the scene must be one thing or the 
other. Which shall it be? A woodland outdoor scene, 
or an indoor scene? Which can be done best? Read 
the text. The Pageant begins with a suggestion of cold 
weather. This could not be suggested in a green gar- 
den or wood. Clearly the scene must be laid indoors. 
Let it be set in the large, “comfortable cottage” that 
the directions call for. 
There would be an open hearth at one end and a 
handsomely made settle beside it, and a fur rug on the 
bare floor. Bare floors must be used because there is 
to be a dance at the end. The directions call for it. 
“A table on which the breakfast things have been 
left standing,” the directions say. But that means 
January’s breakfast, not such a breakfast as mortals 
eat—coffee and eggs and bacon. January was an im- 
mortal and would, therefore, eat such things as immor- 
tals delight in. There would be a very white loaf, 
and perhaps some golden honey made by wild bees— 
such honey as you read of in Greek mythology. A bowl
-P-A-G-E-93
PLAY ANALYSIS 87 
of lump sugar that looks like frost-work. A tall sil- 
ver tankard or pitcher filled with ambrosia. And fruit 
—What about golden apples of Hesperides? And then 
all the fairy tales and poetry books talk about “ jeweled 
fruits.” Isn’t it possible that January could have some 
of those? And what would they be like? Apples that 
looked like huge rubies, and oranges of gold. But 
where shall such fruits be found? Have you never seen 
them growing? Think. Why, they grow on Christ- 
mas trees! And they are called Christmas decorations. 
Have two platters, or bowls, heaped high with them. 
And would the tablecloth be like other tablecloths? 
Perhaps it would be a strip of purple, edged with gold, 
or of scarlet, edged with silver. And what would the 
dishes be? Gold and silver also. (See chapter on 
Properties. ) 
What of the open fire? It is all right to have it at 
the first when January is there. But we cannot have it 
when July and August are there. What shall be 
done? When May enters, can she not put a green 
branch over it? And September, the month of passing 
leaves, can take it off again. Thus it will be a symbol. 
The poets of the Far East used to speak of “ the fire of 
Spring,” and sometimes you find it alluded to in Bo- 
hemian legends. It will be a gay scarlet and yellow 
and orange tissue-paper fire, of course, with a touch of 
gray for ashes. The tree branch can be real, or be 
made by one of the players. 
And since January’s house is not like other houses, 
there might be an alcove at the other end of the room
-P-A-G-E-94
  88 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
from the fire, with green hangings the color of forest 
trees. When these hangings are parted you can see 
that there are other green hangings in the alcove, and 
a pine tree or two standing against them. (You can 
manage without the pine trees, if you must.) It will 
seem as if January would step into the out-of-doors at 
a moment’s notice, if he wanted to. If you cannot 
afford such a thing as a cottage set, then hang the 
whole scene with brown or green curtains, and pretend 
the rest. In this case you cannot have a hearth, but 
you can have a brazier. (See directions for making 
one under Properties. ) 
The Pageant calls for lambs. Of course you cannot 
have them. What should be done? Let us read the 
lines. February says “Oh, you, you little wonder, 
come, come in.” One has no right to change the words 
of an author, but perhaps not even Christina Rossetti 
herself would object to having this word changed to 
“90.” That would mean that the fold was just out- 
side the door, and the lambs and sheep were going to it. 
The word “go” instead of “come” could be used 
through the rest of the lines. A little later the direc- 
tions say that February retires into the background. 
That is where the curtained alcove comes in. February 
can go into that and disappear from view. Wherever 
the directions say that the characters go out or dis- 
appear from view, they can retire into this alcove. 
Thus the problem will be solved. 
Now about the characters themselves. What sort 
of a person is January? Is he not dignified and
-P-A-G-E-95
  PLAY ANALYSIS 89 
stately? And surely kind, for he stirs the fire, hoping 
that whoever is passing through the snow will have a 
light. And next to people his second thought is for 
animals. And what will January wear? Such robes 
as you see in Greek mythology, or in the pictures of 
symbolic characters that Dante Rossetti and his friend 
Burne-Jones loved to paint. Study these pictures. 
For color, his robe should be white. And is he old or 
young? 
Now the robins come in. They are small, so chil- 
dren can play them. How will they be dressed? 
What will their actions be? Will they hop like robins 
and cock their heads on one side? Where will you 
find how to make their costumes? Look at the cos- 
tumes in The Bird Masque by Percy MacKaye, and 
that will help you. The directions say that they pick 
up crumbs and sugar. Of course they can’t stoop 
down to the floor. January must put the sugar on the 
edge of the table. 
Now comes February. Since it may be impossible to 
have a glass on the window-sill, suppose you have a 
clear glass bowl on the table where the wondrous 
fruits are. Now the robins go into the alcove. 
How will you make the twittering of birds for 
April? Aren’t there toys that make sounds just like 
birds? Could not two or three play at once? There 
is no music for April’s song. Could it not be recited 
to music? How would Mendelssohn’s Spring Song 
do? 
What talk of birds and flowers there is when May
-P-A-G-E-96
  90 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
arrives! May ought to be able to tell all about them. 
What do they look like, and where do they grow? 
June can fall asleep on the settle, in front of the 
fire that is now covered with a bough. “ Laburnam ” 
and “the arbor” can be the curtained alcove. When 
December comes in he might shake off snow from his 
sleeves, like silver powder. 
All the characters have now been discussed and cos- 
tumed, we will suppose. The end of the Pageant is 
reached. November and December are on the scene. 
The fire is burning. December is ‘“‘ weaving a gar- 
land.” How would it be to have it a Christmas 
wreath? Then it could be hung up, and as December 
was hanging it, the other characters could come in. 
Now all join in a dance. “ A stately measure,” the 
directions say. What shall it be? How would 
Dvorak’s Humoresque do? é 
If people in the audience like the Pageant very much 
—as no doubt they will if the parts are well done—the 
dance can be repeated. It can either be the same dance 
or a different one. And suppose there are one or two 
encores? Wouldn’t it be pretty to have the little robins 
take the first with their brisk “ hop, hop, hop,” and then 
the Months the second?

COSTUMES: WHAT TO SELECT 
AND WHAT TO AVOID 
Correct and artistic costuming for children’s plays 
involves a knowledge of historical accuracy, color, and 
material. 
Study the best costume books, and histories and fairy 
tales illustrated by well-known artists. See if the au- 
thor of the play has not given directions which you 
can follow. 
Historical accuracy is a rock on which many amateur 
directors come to grief: they are not sure of their cen- 
turies. Headgear and footwear are apt to be of one 
century and costumes of another. 
Select your costumes with reference to your back- 
ground, so there will be no color clash. Use scarlet 
and pink very sparingly. They put other colors out of 
countenance. Do not costume all your characters in 
bright shades. It makes the scene confusing to the eye. 
And unless you are producing an operetta, do not cos- 
fume your peasants all alike, and all in the same colors. 
‘Take common sense as your guide. Do not put little 
peasant girls into red velvet skirts or woodcutters into 
satin jackets, Let them wear the plain, rough ma- 
gr
-P-A-G-E-98
  92 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
terials that they would naturally have. Strive to have 
your costumes appropriate. Twenty years ago fairies 
were dressed in short, stiff white skirts, and tight star- 
spangled bodices; but to-day we know that there is 
nothing stiff or starchy about a fairy. They are cos- 
tumed in soft, clinging materials suggesting the twi- 
light of deep woods, the glamour of mist and moon- 
shine. Do not put weary travelers, explorers, or 
pioneers into spick-and-span raiment. Their garments 
should show the dust and soil of travel. See that the 
footgear of all the players in one scene belongs to the 
same period. See that your fairies and spirits wear 
sandals, not white, high-heeled slippers or high-heeled 
slippers of any color. 
One well-known English pageant master posted this 
sign where it could be read by all groups of children 
taking part in the pageant: “ Keep up your stockings. 
Have your footgear all alike.’ This might also be 
posted by the director of children’s plays! 
Discuss the costumes with the child-players who are 
to wear them. It is perfectly possible for a costume 
to have historical value, to be in harmony with its 
background, and yet have emotional value as well. A 
sinister figure might be all in black, with touches of 
scarlet; innocency in white; while a pale, tender green, 
like the first touch of spring, would be for something 
meant to suggest youth and hope. Woodsy creatures 
would wear wood colors, and so forth. Fairies of the 
dawn. would be in dawn color; twilight elves would 
be in gray, the color of the twilight. A morality play
-P-A-G-E-99
COSTUMES 93 
recently produced by a cast of amateur players had a 
background of deep cream color: the play was laid in 
the latter half of the seventeenth century. The century 
in which the play was laid naturally decided the lines 
of the costumes; but to the youthful players themselves 
were left the deciding of the color scheme, aided al- 
ways by suggestions from the director. “Love,” said 
one child, “should wear white, because the thoughts 
of Love are always pure and fair.” This decided that 
all the colors must be symbolical. Wisdom, by com- 
mon consent, was attired in deep purple, a royal color; 
while another character, Grumble, must be all in black, 
since grumbling suggested darkness. “And Envy 
should wear green,” cried another, “‘ because people are 
said to be green with envy.” What color should Van- 
ity wear? ‘This was a difficult question to decide. 
Pink, blue, and yellow were all discarded. “I think,” 
said one dark-eyed girl, “that Vanity should wear a 
little of every color.” Thus an imitation brocade was 
decided on for Vanity. This shows how symbolic cos- 
tumes can be designed. 
See that the players wear their hair in a mode that 
corresponds to their costumes. Do not put modern 
head-dressing and ancient costumes together. Study 
authentic pictures. The Greek women or girls wore 
their hair bound in a chaplet. In Saxon times they 
wore it in two long heavy braids. In the Middle 
Ages girls and women wore their hair tucked beneath 
a cap or coif. In the eighteenth century it was pom- 
padoured and powdered. Peasants and Indian maidens 
   
-P-A-G-E-100
  04. CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
would naturally wear their hair in two braids. Wood- 
land spirits and little dryads would naturally wear their 
hair flying. Unless the play is laid in the present time, 
or in the days of the Civil War, never put hair ribbons 
on the children. Above all, never, never put them on 
spirits, fairies, court ladies, Greek maidens, Puritans, 
Indians, or Colonials. 
Do not mix the costumes of two centuries. Unless 
otherwise indicated keep the lines of the costumes soft 
and flowing. Do not bunch the costumes of fairies 
and spirits with too many petticoats. 
Make the simple costumes yourself. They will have 
better material, lines, and color than those obtainable 
from costumers. If you wish to, dye them the desired 
shades, although the color range of what you can buy 
is now much larger than formerly. 
For materials, the simplest weaves will do as well as 
the most ornate. Use cheesecloth for thin material, 
such as fairy dresses and Greek robes. Use cambric 
and silesia to simulate satin, cotton crepon or silk crepon, 
where a softer and heavier material than cheese- 
cloth is needed. Use silkoline for flowered silk. Use 
burlap for rough peasant suits or tunics; hop-sacking 
for others. White cotton-batting with black tails 
basted on it makes ermine. For medieval costumes the 
pictures in illustrated editions of Guizot’s Histories 
of France and England will be found invaluable. 
Also Boutet de Monvel’s Jeanne D’Arc, and good il- 
lustrated editions of Pilgrim’s Progress contain pic- 
tures of costumes that can be easily copied. For
-P-A-G-E-101
  COSTUMES 95 
Grecian, mythological, and neo-Grecian costumes The 
Wonder Book by Hawthorne, with illustrations by 
Walter Crane, has some very charming examples. 
For different periods of American costume try Eggle- 
ston’s Illustrated History of the United States, and 
Costume in America by Elizabeth McClelland. All 
the books of fairy tales edited by Andrew Lang have 
delightful fairy costumes in them. For costumes of the 
Holy Land see The Castle of Zion by George Hodges, 
with illustrations. The Copley Prints of The Holy 
Grail, by. Abbey, will suggest costumes for the court of 
Arthur and his Knights. The Arabian Nights, illus- 
trated by Maxfield Parrish, has imaginative ideas for 
Arabian costumes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
VI 
SCENERY AND HOW TO MAKE IT 
Next in importance to selecting the cast of a children’s 
play is the selecting of its scenery. The day of ornate, 
cluttered scenery has gone by, both for the adult and 
the children’s theater. Hangings are now used where 
wood sets and papier-maché effects once held sway. 
Line and color and light are now used to convey effect. 
The audience is credited with a little imagination. 
Suggestion is used instead of actuality. 
Adequate plays for children usually contain ample 
directions for costume setting, and the wise director 
will follow them. The atmosphere of a play is at least 
half created by its scene-setting. Avoid the tawdry 
and meaningless as you would a pestilence. 
Strive for simplicity of effect. Dark-green hang- 
ings with a brown floor-cloth, and some make-believe 
tree-trunks, suggest a wood. One needs no more 
scenery than that to convey the heart of a forest. See 
to it that when the curtains part at the entrance of a 
character that there are other green curtains behind 
them, so as to keep the deep forest effect. Another way 
of suggesting a wood is to fasten dozens of real tree 
branches to green or brown curtains. Or at the 
Christmas season, pine trees may suggest the forest 
96  
-P-A-G-E-103
    SCENERY o7, 
primeval. The Educational Dramatic League (New 
York) has instituted high screens draped with what- 
ever colors are needed. The framework of the screens 
is not unlike the wooden “ clothes-horses” used for 
drying clothes, only they are made of iron and stand 
more securely. For draping such screens, whether the 
woodwork is iron or wood, use felt, canton flannel, 
crepon, or paper muslin, according to the scene you 
wish to convey. Crape paper may also be used, but it 
is rather perishable. 
Dark forest-green hangings are absolutely invaluable. 
If only one set of hangings can be afforded, have them 
of this color. And denim is a good serviceable ma- 
terial. They can be a wood in one scene, and with a 
flat brown border basted to the other side they can 
suggest a Puritan interior, With a rose-flower cre- 
tonne border basted to them they can become a Colonial 
room. With a pale-blue border, they are a palace. 
With a white Grecian border, they represent a room 
in a Grecian home. To have them suggest the interior 
of a peasant home is, naturally, the most difficult of all, 
because the scene of a rude interior with a hearth is 
usually meant ‘to be conveyed. For this sort of a scene 
have the furniture low, a low bench or two, and a some- 
what squat table. Have as little furniture as pos- 
sible. You wish merely to suggest the scene. Have 
a tallow dip for a light, and for a hearth—not a hearth 
at all! Have a brazier with charcoal burning, as is 
often customary in some of the European peasant 
homes. This can be made by painting a tripod wash-
-P-A-G-E-104
  98 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
stand black, and setting a candle deep in it, or burn- 
ing a little red powder to give a glow. One has al- 
ways to be careful of fire; but to burn a candle or 
powder in a bowl is generally safe. Stand the tripod 
where it is least likely to be upset. ‘The characters 
who enter can warm their hands at it as at a hearth. 
Of course, if it can be had, a red electric bulb set in the 
bowl, or a red spot-light turned on it is the best of all. 
Never mix painted and curtain scenery. This is 
never done by the artists of the stage. ‘Take the Win- 
throp Ames production of Snow White for a model. 
There, scenes with their background of curtains al- 
ternated with painted scenes. The two were fever 
used together. Rhinehardt, a man who has made the 
Gordon Craig ideas the basis of his stage art, procures 
wonderful effects by the use of draped interiors. He 
never mixes painted and draped scenery. These men 
are, of course, artists of the adult stage; but what 
they do can be followed in a small way for the chil- 
dren’s stage. Some suggestions follow. They are de- 
signs which can be followed at the least possible ex- 
pense. 
For a Patacre.—Hangings of pale blue, or deep 
vivid blue. A throne chair of white and gold, set on 
a raised dais, covered with blue. But suppose a throne 
chair cannot be had? Then a box dais, and on it set 
firmly an armchair. Drape or cover this with pale-blue 
cambric, glazed side outward, to represent satin. 
Place over the back of it cloth of gold that is made 
by gilding burlap with radiator bronze; or a spangled
-P-A-G-E-105
SCENERY 99 
scarf placed straight across the back will make a fine 
glitter. 
A Garpen.—The same method of arrangement as 
for a wood or forest, with vines of paper flowers that 
can be bought very cheaply by the yard from the 
Dennison Tissue Paper Co. These vines are fastened 
to the curtains as if on a trellis. A little confetti laid 
beneath them gives the effect of fallen blossoms. 
A Dunceron.—Black hangings, and black or pine 
furniture. A black or gray floor-cloth. 
A Street SceNE.—This is the most difficult to con- 
vey by means of curtains, but it can be done. Remem- 
ber that you are to suggest a street scene only. Have 
gray unglazed cambric hangings, with the outlines of 
doors and quaintly shaped windows put on life-size 
by stitching outlines of black cambric to the gray cur- 
tains. It is better to stitch them than to paint them, 
for cloth that shows up paint is really rather expensive. 
The effect is to suggest a street, and as this kind of 
scenery belongs to no particular period it can be used 
from the tenth to the seventeenth century. It can 
also be used to suggest modern scenes in quaint Euro- 
pean villages such as little out-of-the-way French, Ger- 
man, Scandinavian, or Russian towns. For a modern 
street scene it is, of course, quite inappropriate. 
A Perasant’s Homer.—As has been suggested, a 
brazier, benches, and a table. Brown hangings, and a 
brown floor-cloth if possible. If not, green will do. 
An Eastern Patace.—Yellow curtains, with a 
throne covered in either scarlet or orange. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  100 CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
Tue Drop-Curtain.—For a drop-curtain, dark 
green is to be preferred above all other colors. Next to 
this dark brown. It must be of thick material, denim 
or felt. Take dark blue or dark red if you cannot 
get green or brown. Green is best because it can be 
used to advantage in forest scenes after it is worn out 
as a curtain. Or brown curtains can be used when 
half worn out for a floor-cloth for forest scenes. 
The laws of certain cities prohibit the use of curtains 
in schools, on account of the fear of fire. Other 
schools cannot afford a curtain large enough for their 
auditorium. This makes things very awkward for 
plays demanding a change of scene. Of course the 
lights can be turned off in some schools, and the scenery 
changed in semi-darkness; but there are schools where 
even this advantage cannot be had. For those who 
find themselves in a curtain predicament the following 
is suggested. Have six scenery pages, boys or girls as 
nearly of one height as possible. Let them wear a dark 
color, or colors, and be sure their shoes and stockings 
are black. Have couch-tovéts, portiéres, or strips of 
cloth fastened to curtain rods. Let the pages pass 
quickly to the front of the stage as soon as the scene 
closes, holding these improvised screens between chang- 
ing scene and audience till the scenery is moved, thus: 
===

SCENERY 101 
For a church scene have dark-colored hangings. An 
offertory table with a long straight centerpiece of white, 
candles at either end, and in the center. 
Be careful of your stage furnishing. It can do much 
to make or mar a play. See that your chairs and table 
are of the period described in the text. If your play is 
Greek, study the lines of Greek benches or seats. You 
can have them made very inexpensively, and painted 
white. Never, under any circumstances, use modern 
furniture in Greek plays. 
For your interior scenes, if your play is laid in early 
Saxon times, in the days of Robin Hood, or the Pilgrim 
Fathers, in fact in any century up to the eighteenth, 
you are safe in using heavy black mission furniture 
with upright chairs and plain tables. The mission 
furniture may not fit the period in detail, but it is un- 
obtrusive, has simple lines and the massiveness of the 
early furniture. Never use bright-colored furniture 
unless so directed in the text of the play. 
Use ornaments very sparingly, unless called for. 
They clutter your scene. Remember that tablecloths, 
white or silken, were not in general use till the 
eighteenth century. Even then they were used for 
meals, not for the tables in drawing-rooms or libraries. 
These were polished and bare. Do not use “ tidies ” 
or “throws” unless your scene is laid in America at 
the time of the Civil War, or unless you wish to sug- 
gest an old-fashioned farmhouse interior. Do not use 
cushions of variegated colors unless your scene is Japa- 
nese. Too many bright and varied colors distract the

eye. Use dim, quiet colors. In fact, have the same 
taste in your scenes that you would in household deco- 
ration. Choose your accessories with reference to the 
color of your background. ‘Try to work out your 
scene-setting in one or two quiet colors. It is the actors, 
not the scene, that you wish to bring before the eye of 
the audience. 
Have as little furniture on the stage as possible. 
Use a floor-cloth, or if this is not obtainable, a bare 
floor, with or without a fur rug. Do not put a leopard 
skin in the home of a Danish peasant, as one amateur 
producer did. Beware how you use Persian rugs. 
Few amateur plays are laid in Persia. Above all, be- 
ware of brightly-colored strips of carpet, unless you 
wish your scene to be comic or grotesque. 
An eighteenth-century interior may be light in color. 
Have spindle-legged furniture, cretonne hangings, and 
soft-colored cushions. With this century came in lac- 
quered tables and trays. 
Never, unless your scene-setting actually requires it, 
set a scene in a pink or red room. It will kill the color 
of most of your costumes. “ Ah!” cries some unfortu- 
nate producer, ‘‘ what if you are in a little town where 
the only interior scene is red? What are you going to 
do?” In this case use black or dark furniture, and 
try to offset it. If you are in a place where you must 
choose between a red dining-room set, or a “ parlor ” 
set ornate with gold and bright wall-paper, when what 
you need is the interior of a peasant’s home, turn your 
scenery inside out. ‘The white back and the wooden 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  SCENERY 103 
props will look like a crude, whitewashed home. If 
the back is only a little yellowish, or dirty, you are 
saved. If you are allowed to tack brown wall-paper 
(plain) to the back of the set, you can make an ex- 
cellent peasant hut out of it, or an interior that will 
do for a Puritan living-room, or eighteenth-century 
kitchen. 
See that the color of your hangings or scenery are 
the same in gaslight and in daylight. Artificial light 
has a way of making green look blue and blue look 
green. Be especially careful to see that the dark green 
of your forest scene is not black at night. ‘‘ Look be- 
fore you leap,” might be transposed to ‘ Look before 
you buy.” ‘Take care of your scenery and details, and 
much of your play will take care of itself. 
For scenery study the pictures in Guizot’s France, and 
the Jeanne D’Arc pictures by Boutet de Monvel; also 
the interiors shown in illustrated editions of Pilgrim’s 
Progress. For the interior of foreign peasant homes, 
and scraps of scenery, try Little Pilgrimages Amongst 
English Inns, by Josephine Tozier; Little Pilgrimages 
Amongst French Inns, by Charles Gibson. Some of 
the backgrounds in the illustrated editions of Lang’s 
Fairy-tales. Also Little Pilgrimages Amongst Bavarian 
Inns, by Frank R. Fraprie.

PROPERTIES AND HOW TO MAKE 
THEM 
Use care in the selection of your properties. Study 
your text. Avoid anachronisms. Do not use muskets 
and pipes in a scene that is laid before muskets were 
invented and tobacco discovered. Do not use modern 
lamps to light a medieval scene. Do not use modern 
musical instruments in a scene that is laid in Grecian 
or medieval times. These are some of the average mis- 
takes. Remember that penholders and pens are a 
modern invention. Use quill pens and sand for plays 
whose scenes are laid before the early nineteenth cen- 
tury. Do not use clocks in Greek or early Saxon 
scenes. If your characters are writing or sending let- 
ters in the times when parchment was used, have the 
paper yellowed to look like parchment. Do not have 
a modern fireplace in a peasant’s home where the 
hearth would naturally be built of stone. Do not use 
modern dishes in medieval scenes. Buy paper plates 
and cover them with colored tissue paper, or paint 
them till they resemble the kind of platters you need. 
Brown will represent earthenware. Gold and silver 
for fairy palaces can be made by gilding them or cover- 
104 ;
-P-A-G-E-111
PROPERTIES 105 
ing them with gold paper. Remember that forks and 
spoons were not in popular use in the days of Robin 
Hood. Fingers and knives did the required work. 
‘The hearth was used for cooking. Beware of modern- 
looking cooking utensils in fairy, Puritan, or Colonial 
scenes. ‘“‘ Gadzooks”’ and modern coffee-pots do not go 
together. Beware of modern frying-pans for hearth- 
stone scenes. Use iron skillets instead. A kettle for these 
scenes is always permissible; but if it is a peasant scene, 
see that it is not the too-shining brass of the tea-kettle 
of the afternoon tea-table! Remember that coal fires 
are modern. If you are having a fairy-peasant scene 
use wood instead. Use braziers where the scenes re- 
quire it. They are always effective, and can be made 
by blacking a tripod washbowl, and lighting a little 
red-fire powder in it, or some joss-sticks which will 
give a thin blue smoke. Or a red electric bulb can be 
used in it, if there is no spot-light. 
Be careful of your lighting. The Greeks had torches 
when they wanted a bright light, and small, bowl- 
shaped lamps with a wick and oil for smaller illumina- 
tions. Gold cardboard torches from which stream 
slashed strips of flame-colored tissue paper is a safe 
substitute. The Saxons and early English had rush- 
lights and bowl-lamps. A bowl that looks like earthen- 
ware, with the stub of a candle in it, will do. In 
medieval times swinging lamps and candles were for 
the rich; while the humble were_content with tallow 
dips only. ip, 
Don’t use the spinning-wheel before the spinning-

wheel was invented, just because it is decorative. 
Don’t use a modern glass “tumbler” for your 
doublet-and-hose hero to drink from. A cheap glass 
goblet covered with gold paper will look like a gold 
goblet. 
If possible have your youthful players make their 
own properties. ‘Take, for instance, a fallen tree- 
trunk, or a log for a forest scene. It can be made 
by fastening together two small vinegar barrels, and 
covering them with green and brown burlap to repre- 
sent bark and moss. Or it can be covered with brown 
burlap and gray lichen—real lichen fastened to it with 
strong glue. Such a stage property as this can be used 
again and again. And the boy who went to the fields 
or the outlying suburb to get the moss—may he not 
gain something of nature’s secrets that he had not 
known before? And may not the eager quest bring 
him hours of entire happiness? A seventeenth-century 
broom can be made by tying an armful of hazel or 
willow switches to an old broom-handle. The browner 
and sturdier these twigs are the better. This broom 
material can be gathered at the same time as the moss. 
Stimulate initiative and invention wherever possible. 
A round brown collar-box is only a collar-box till 
you use it for an earthen bowl. A white cardboard 
shoe-box is cut down a little, covered with black tissue 
paper, has a little yellow pane inserted in each side, 
and a curtain ring for a handle. Behold a lantern for 
a Yankee Minute Man, or Paul Revere, or anyone else 
who wants to use it!
-P-A-G-E-113
PROPERTIES 107 
Remarkable stage furniture can be made from wooden 
boxes of all sizes. A packing-case makes a dais. Sev- 
eral boxes nailed together and stained brown will make 
a peasant’s cupboard. 
Three boxes nailed together like this ™ will make 
a hearth. If it is to be a medieval or fairy-tale hearth, 
cover it with cheap gray cambric, bulked to look like 
stone, and marked like stone with splotches of white 
and brown chalk. Be sure you turn the unglazed 
side of the cambric outward. Use chalk because paint 
does not show up well on cambric. A brick fireplace 
for a modern scene can be made in the same way, cover- 
ing the boxes with brick chimney paper that can be 
bought at Dennison’s Tissue Paper Co., Boston, Chi- 
cago, or New York. One of their catalogues will 
prove invaluable to directors living in the country. A 
narrow box on rockers, stained brown, becomes a Puri- 
tan or eighteenth-century cradle. Gilded and hooded, 
it is the cradle of a royal princess. Couch-seats can 
be made from boxes, only be sure that they are 
secure. 
Books which contain pictures from which properties

MUSIC AND DANCES 
THE music and dances which sometimes are used in 
children’s plays are usually indicated in the text, but 
there are occasions when dramatic directors or teach- 
ers find themselves in need of further help. A good 
tule for dances is to know the dates when they were 
invented, and when they proved most popular. Do not 
have your characters dancing a minuet in hoop-skirts, 
as one amateur producer was known to do. The Gal- 
liard, the Couranto, and the Levanto came in with 
the Masque in England, the Morris Dances even 
earlier. The Minuet and Pavane were of French 
origin. In music try to avoid anachronisms. If your 
play is laid in Shakespeare’s time, use the old melodies 
“ Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes,” etc. Do not 
use patriotic airs before those airs were written. For 
instance, “The Star-Spangled Banner” should not be 
used in Colonial scenes. Do not use Civil War songs 
in Colonial times, as has been blandly done by some 
who felt they had no time to look the others up. Get a 
good musical dictionary and it will help you greatly. 
Try to have your music, either overture, entr’acte, or 
dance, give the feeling of a scene. Always begin your 
109
-P-A-G-E-116
110 CHILDREN’S PLAYS © | 
rehearsals with the same music you will use throughout. 
It is fatal to change. If you are to rehearse with a 
piano first, and have an orchestra for your play, or a 
trio, see at the beginning that what is arranged for 
piano is also arranged for orchestra, and that all the 
parts for the orchestra are on hand. If they are sent 
for at the last minute the music store may be out of 
them, there will be another delay, and chaos will be 
the result. 
Avoid cheap and trashy music. It will pull down 
the whole: effect of your play. If you feel you must 
use a modern march or waltz, take one whose title 
is not well known—even if the waltz prove a little less 
catchy than the one in mind. For instance, if your 
fairies enter to “The Merry Widow Waltz,” or 
your dwarfs march in to “ Hands Across the Sea” 
you have called up an entirely different effect from the 
one you wished to produce, and spoiled your play. 
Take less well-known compositions if you will use 
that type of music. But it is well to avoid it alto- 
gether, and in its place substitute the compositions of 
Dvorak, MacDowell, Gilbert, Nevin, Grieg, and 
Mendelssohn. 
For dances, in giving diagrams and examining their 
technique, the following books will be found valu- 
able: 
The Dance: Its History. By Troy and Margaret 
Kinney.

(Music and Dances.) 
Folk Dances and Singing Games. By Elizabeth 
Burchenal. (Music and Songs.) 
The Gilbert Dances, edited by Susan Hoffman Gil- 
man, and published by Schirmer, will be found good 
for minuets, gavottes, and pavanes. 
For simple plays given in the lower gradeés, for very 
little children, the following books have little musical 
motifs and dances that are easy and available. 
School Dances, by Melvin Ballou Gilbert. (With 
full directions.) Edited by Susan Hoffman Gilman. 
There are eighteen dances in this book and their titles 
will at once suggest the kind of play they should be used 
for. Grade One, Grade Two, and Grade Three are 
the book’s subdivisions, and these numbers fit the grades 
of the public school. 
Legends of the Red Men, by Harvey Worthington 
Loomis, are good for Indian dances, and lend them- 
selves also to Indian ceremonial and pantomime. 
Dramatic Games and Dances, by Caroline Craw- 
ford, are good for younger children in everyday plays. 
For fairy dances use Dvorak’s Humoresque and 
Nevin’s Narcissus, and the Pizzicato Polka from the 
Ballet Sylvia. The Folk Dances have already been in- 
dicated. In the Hall of the Mountain King, by Grieg, 
from The Peer Gynt Suite, is splendid for gnomes, and

goblin dances or entrances. Edward German’s Suite of 
Henry Eighth Dances are good for medieval plays, and 
for morality plays. Idyllo, by Theodore Lack, will be 
found adaptable for the entrance or dance music of 
dryads or spirits. MacDowell’s From an Indian Lodge 
has the color and weird beauty for an Indian scene. 
For an orchestra The Mother Goose Suite, by Ravel, 
has four selections, any one of which would make a 
children’s overture.

PLAYS FOR SETTLEMENTS 
Woe and varied are the uses of plays in settlements. 
Through them the members of the settlement clubs 
can be taught our language and respect for our flag. 
Yet too often do the young people come to think 
lightly of, or despise the simple art, the folklore, and 
the customs of their native land. The settlement that 
produces plays of these elder countries (the plays, of 
course, are acted in English) shows its young people 
the heritage they have brought with them, and should 
never forget. Moreover, it is a bond that draws young 
and old together: for fathers and mothers, seeing the 
native costumes and perhaps knowing the native legend, 
are able to grasp much of what goes on, and take an 
interest in it. It is often a tragically evident fact that 
the emigrant mother with no knowledge of English 
finds her children growing away from her. But with 
the production of an Italian play for Italians, or a- 
Russian play for the Russians, the children are only 
too glad to consult their “ sisters and their cousins and 
their aunts,” not counting their mothers and their 
grandmothers. ‘They ask about costumes. How did 
mother wear this or that in the old country? They 
142

borrow trinkets or gay handkerchiefs. Churches and 
guilds in all our cities have this same problem to deal 
with. Therefore, in this particular compilation stress 
is put on the folk play. The strictly patriotic or ethical 
play can be found under other headings.

PLAYS FOR GROUP READINGS 
‘Tuis means plays that are read in the schools, without 
an attempt at acting. Each student is responsible for 
whatever character he or she assumes, and reads only 
that character’s lines throughout the play. This is 
done as a study in English, as it has been found that 
children take a keen interest in this form of drama.

BOOKS ON AND OF SCHOOL PLAYS By Constance D’Arcy Mackay 
HOW TO PRODUCE CHILDREN’S PLAYS 
The author is a recognized authority on the production 
of plays and pageants in the public schools, and combines en- 
thusiastic sympathy with sound, practical instructions. She 
tells both how to inspire and care for the young actor, how 
to make costumes, properties, scenery, where to find de- 
signs for them, what music to use, etc., etc. She prefaces it 
all with an interesting historical sketch of the plays-for-chil- 
dren movement, includes elaborate detailed analyses of per- 
formances of Browning’s Pied Piper and Rosetti’s Pageant 
, of the Months, and concludes with numerous valuable an- 
ical lists of plays for various grades and occasions,

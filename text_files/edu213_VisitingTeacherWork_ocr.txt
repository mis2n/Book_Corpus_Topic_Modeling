EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Supervision is essentially a codperative enterprise. Such 
an enterprise demands a unification and codrdination of 
the efforts of the many different individuals engaged in 
different parts of the whole task. This implies and demands 
expert leadership. Leadership is difficult enough in any 
activity, but is doubly so when the group led is made up 
of individuals whose social status is the same as that of the 
leader. Furthermore, the teaching group is possessed of 
traditions and training that make all the more necessary 
the type of leadership that is in fact codperative. The 
problem of unifying and coérdinating through expert 
leadership and at the same time inspiring and motivating 
those who are being led come to a sharp focus at the point 
of actual contact between leader and led supervisor and 
teacher. 
There are few problems in the field of supervision fraught 
with greater possibilities for good and at the same time 
beset with greater difficulties than that of the constructive 
criticism of teaching. In the first place, many supervisors 
do not seem to know what to look for, that is, they do not 
know how to study the work of a teacher. Many do not 
know how to marshal the facts in diagnosing the teaching 
situation. Many do not know what to say to the teacher, 
or how to say it. 
On the other hand, of course, there are many super- 
visors who seem to have the knack of doing this, even 
though they are unable to analyze the process for the bene- 
fit of others. There is also a small but growing group of

supervisors who have developed a highly efficient technique 
and who are able in addition to discuss analytically their 
procedure. 
The authors are attempting to offer guidance in meeting 
this difficult and important problem, namely, visiting the 
teacher at work. They have set forth in clear and simple 
terms a body of general guiding principles, supplemented 
copiously with concrete case material and summary outline. 
It is in their handling of the concrete illustrations and in 
their analytical discussion of such material that the authors 
have been particularly skillful. 
The treatment is complete and detailed. Discussion is 
not confined to the narrow limits of classroom visitation and 
conference but includes material upon all related phases 
of studying the teacher at work. In addition to the com- 
mon type of supervisory conference, there will be found 
illustrations and analyses of preteaching and follow-up 
conferences. Cases of failure in teaching due to other 
causes than weak teaching technique come in for thorough 
discussion. There is finally an interesting summary of 
actual cases which have been successfully solved by super- 
visors, together with problem cases for the student to 
analyze. 
The supervisor who depends upon ‘‘getting the atmos- 
phere’’ of a room, the supervisor who talks vaguely and 
sentimentally about ‘‘morale’’ and ‘‘spirit’’ will find little 
eomfort in these pages. Atmosphere, morale, and spirit 
are vital and essential and must be cared for. However, 
the supervisor who goes no further than these elements in 
supervision, while he may have a situation free from fric- 
tion, may avoid explosions, and may be quite popular with 
many of his teachers, will not materially advance the 
level of teaching efficiency. Something else is necessary, 
namely, knowledge of and attention to facts, actual pro- 
cesses, obvious and unavoidable circumstances conditioning ‘

teaching. The authors have made their biggest contribu- 
tion through their ability to deal plainly with ‘‘brass 
tacks.’’? The supervisors and teachers who are genuinely 
interested in discussing the downright facts concerning the 
betterment of teaching will find many things of value.

PREFACE 
This book is written primarily for superintendents, prin- 
cipals, grade and departmental supervisors, and critic 
teachers. It should also be of practical assistance, however, 
to classroom teachers who desire to analyze, evaluate, and 
improve their own teaching methods. The purpose of the 
book is to supply a body of concrete material dealing with 
the problems of classroom visitation and conference: (1) 
how to visit the classroom, what to look for, and how to 
diagnose teaching; (2) how to lead the teacher through 
conference to a realization of her own needs and to plan 
for her improvement, that is, what to say and how to 
say it; (3) how to plan remedial programs through indi- 
vidual conferences, preteaching conferences, follow-up con- 
ferences, ete. Through general discussion, concrete cases, 
and summary outline, it is the purpose of this book to 
offer reliable guidance in meeting the problems that arise 
in this most important phase of the field of supervision. 
The authors wish to acknowledge: first, the assistance of 
the many supervisors and classroom teachers who have 
furnished data and concrete cases; second, the special 
assistance of Miss Lena Shaw, supervisor of handwriting; 
Miss Lily Goodhew, assistant supervisor of art; and Miss 
Grace McAdams, supervisor of domestic science, all of 
the Detroit public schools; and the following teachers also 
of the Detroit public schools: Miss Catherine Densmore, 
Miss Ferolyn Narreter, Miss Harriet Kreener, and Miss 
Martha Grace; third, the assistance of Dr. Curtis Merri- 
man, Department of Education, University of Wisconsin,

  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
‘“As is the teacher, so is the school,’’ has become an 
educational maxim. Her personality, her vision, and her 
skill are, next to the child’s own intelligence, the most\ ” 
powerful factors in the school organization conditioning | 
educational progress, Any agency that makes for better / 
vision, greater enthusiasm, and a clearer understanding in 
the teaching corps is contributing abundantly to the reali- 
zation of the ends for which the school exists. |The guidance 
of teachers to these higher levels of achievement is the task 
of the supervisor,| whether he be called superintendent, 
principal, grade or departmental supervisor, or critic. 
This splendid opportunity for aiding teachers to master 
more effective methods of hing is often lost for the 
lack of an acceptable procedure for dealing with the deli- 
cate problems of human relationship involved in giving 
assistance. At the best, the task is performed with a 
modicum of skill. The purpose of this book is to make 
available to superintendents, principals, grade and depart- 
mental supervisors, and critics an abundance of concrete 
material dealing specifically with the problems of visiting 
and helping the teacher at work, in the hope that it may 
aid supervisors in setting up standards and applying them 
with greater success. 
In a recent investigation two hundred supervising prin- 
cipals, elementary supervisors, and superintendents were

asked to state what, in their judgment, were the best_ means 
of obtaining improvement in classroom teaching.t) Closer 
supervision, according to this group, was the most impor- 
_ tant means,! This supervision was more specifically de- 
fined as demonstration teaching, conferences with teach- 
ers, visitation and observation, visiting days, teachers’ 
meetings, teacher participation in the solution of problems, 
use of tests and measurements, diagnosis of teacher failures 
and remedial measures, providing good working conditions, 
assignment of fewer subjects to teachers, development of 
the socialized recitation, stimulation of professional growth, 
provision for better equipment, helping the teacher to 
maintain order and attention, careful grading of pupils, 
development of friendly feeling between supervisor and 
teacher, and providing a condition of freedom for the 
teacher to carry out her own ideas. Such alist as this 
indicates the variety of contactpossible between teacher 
and supervisor as well as the necessary scope of a text 
dealing with problems of supervision. 
The specific topics to be discussed in this book are: 
1. How to study the work of the teacher: studying the 
teacher, analyzing recitations, getting the facts, etc. 
2. Preteaching conferences: helping the teacher plan 
her work, lesson planning, ete. 
8. Helping the teacher: procedures, illustrations, sug- 
gestions for the constructive criticism of teaching. 
4. Visiting the classroom: a discussion of the many 
routine matters pertaining to classroom visitation, when to 
visit, how to prepare for visits, entering and leaving the 
room. 
_ 5. Case studies of teaching: stenographie reports of 
supervisory conferences, reports and analyses of specific 
teaching situations.

In general, it is the purpose of this book to present to 
all those who are interested in the critical study of teach- 
ing, definite plans for such study, to direct them in the 
processes of arriving at conclusions that can be used as 
a basis for constructive policies leading to improved 
teaching, and to offer guidance in effective ways of mak- 
ing these policies function in actual everyday classroom 
practice.

  CHAPTER II 
STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
The purpose of supervision. The recitation period is 
the agency through which the leadership of the teacher 
functions. (Her purpose is to enable the child to come 
into full possession of desirable race experiences) In the 
recitation the child and the subject matter are both pres- 
ent and the teacher aims to furnish favorable activities 
for bringing these two together. Scientific study of the 
materials of the curriculum has done much to improve 
the selection and organization of subject matter. Like- 
wise, the study of how children learn has added much to 
our knowledge of better teaching. It is the purpose of 
the supervisor, working through the teacher, to surround 
the child with those conditions most favorable to learning. 
Supervision must grow out of a knowledge of the 
work of the teacher. Before any considerable assistance 
ean be given by superintendents, principals, drade and 
departmental supervisors, and critic teachers in creating 
better conditions for learning and in helping the teacher 
master more productive teaching procedures, attention 
must be given to the study of the teacher at work.\ The 
criticism of teaching must be based upon a careful study 
of the work of the teacher. Too many supervisors observe 
teaching superficially and offer advice abundantly. Many 
teachers have had the experience of being admonished by 
some supervisor who did not appear to be possessed of 
the facts in the case. To look into the classroom for a 
few moments now and then, and to arrive at some gen- 
4

eral notions concerning the failure or success of a teacher, 
is not enough.\ Unfortunately, some supervisors do noth- 
ing more than this and hand down decisions about pro- 
fessional ability, personal fitness, and intellectual capac- 
ity, with little thought of the consequences. Teachers are 
rather naively directed to do this and to do that. Before 
attempting to offer much advice it is necessary to have 
more than a general notion of what is wrong. It is not 
enough to know that the teacher is ill pedagogically. “The 
supervisors must diagnose the work of the teacher just 
as the present-day physician studies the symptoms of dis- 
ease. The physician sets about to get exact information. 
Once he knows the facts he applies a very specific remedy. 
And supervisors, too, must study teachers and teachifig 
carefully to be genuinely helpful. The purpose of this 
chapter is to discuss, as far as the space will permit, 
specific suggestions on how to obtain information 
about a teaching situation—the pupils, the teacher, and 
the teaching—upon which a remedial program may be 
based. 
The ability to analyze a recitation critically comes 
only with training. Teaching is a complex situation. To 
some individuals teaching is ‘‘one big booming buzzing 
confusion.’’ Teaching must be seen not en masse but in 
detail. To what extent is the average individual able to 
comprehend teaching situations clearly and elementally? 
What does the average principal see when he visits the 
classroom?) To some supervisors, if the teacher is attrac- 
tive, the pupils orderly, and if parents do not complain, 
the teaching is good; or, as one teacher expressed it, ‘‘If the 
children are neat and clean, on time, sing their songs 
well, and sit quietly in their seats, I am doing acceptable 
work.’’ The correct analysis of the recitation demands 
on the part of the supervisor a peculiar skill which can 
best be attained by repeated practice in evaluating reci-

6 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
tations under the leadership of those who, through years 
of experience, have demonstrated unusual ability in this 
field. 
What to see in the recitation. The usual approach to 
an analysis and an evaluation of_a lesson in practice 
consists in determining, first of all, lits major strength and 
its chief weakness.{ The trend of this analysis is deter- 
mined largely by the nature of the conference that fol- 
lows. The conference must usually, except in training 
institutions, occupy only a limited amount of time. This 
means that only a very few points can be considered. 
Although the supervisor must be conscious of the many 
elements of the lesson, (his skill in the conference will 
be shown by his ability to select the most vital elements 
for discussion with the teacher. But back of the points 
to be considered, there must be a very fundamental analy- 
sis, first, of the pupils with whom the teacher must work; 
' second, of the teacher who guides the process; third, of 
the teaching which weaves together the many elements of 
the recitation. 
I. Srupyine THE Porm 
The supervisor must observe the types of children 
taught. One supervisor states that he always asks the 
teacher during his first conference with her to describe 
the types of children in the room. He does this because 
he feels that this information helps him to understand 
the teacher’s viewpoint. Often it is the supervisor’s task, 
by means of standard intelligence or achievement tests, 
to correct the teacher’s judgment of her pupils. One 
feature to be guarded against is the readiness of some 
teachers to acquaint the supervisor with the shortcomings 
of the pupils in the presence of the class by designating 
them as the ‘‘slow group” or the ‘‘C’’ group. ‘‘Miss 
S—— has the A’s and B’s, so of course you must not

STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 4 
’ 
expect much of me,’’ said one teacher to a new super- 
visor as he entered the room. 
Some items to note about the pupils. It is usually 
best to have at hand a simple outline of the information 
needed concerning the personnel of the class: 
1. Note the pupils’ general intelligence or ability to 
learn. If scores from intelligence tests are not available, 
the information can usually be obtained through a series 
of informal exercises. 
2. Note evidences of individual levels of achievement 
and knowledge of subject matter. Two sources of infor- 
mation are available: scores on educational tests and 
school marks. 
8. Note special learning abilities, such as command of 
English, general reading ability, ability to use the tools 
of learning readily, ete. 
4. Note previous experience with the subject matter 
in the school environment and in the home environment. 
5.. Note special language difficulties, such as may ap- 
pear in foreign communities. 
6. Note home conditions and home factors condition- 
ing learning. 
7. Note items of health, such as absences because of 
‘ illness, physical defects, ete. 
8. Note special interests of the pupils. In brief, get 
in mind the types of pupils with which the teacher has 
to work. 
II. Srupyine THE TEACHER 
The supervisor must know the teacher. The super- 
visor not only must know the different types of pupils 
under the teacher’s direction but must know the mental 
characteristics of the teacher. Matters of health, home 
conditions, social obligations, and the like, reflect themi- 
selves in the classroom. Then, too, the method of teach-  
-P-A-G-E-26
  
8 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
ing pursued by the teacher must necessarily. reflect the 
teacher’s personality. The principle of individual differ- 
ences applies to teachers much as it does to pupils. Infor- 
mation about the teacher is needed not only to understand 
what goes on in the recitation but also for the guidance 
of the supervisor in his efforts to assist the teacher. The 
supervisor who is most helpful to teachers is the one who 
conscientiously attempts to understand the many special 
characteristics of the individuals whose work he desires 
to improve. 
Collect information about the teacher systematically. 
A good procedure is to go about the matter of getting 
facts systematically. 
1. Study the case history. A study of the teacher’s 
history should reveal sources of difficulties. Explanations 
of poor work frequently lie in the past. Note particu- 
larly: (a) past failures and successes, (b) causes of pres- 
ent difficulties, (c) previous assistance, (d) reaction to 
assistance, (e) progress already made in overcoming dif- 
ficulties, ete. 
2. Study the teacher’s professional equipment. A care- 
ful analysis of training, experience, and professional inter- 
ests may reveal specific causes of difficulties. 
8. Study the teacher’s physical equipment. Possibly 
the teacher is ill. Just because she continues to meet 
classes does not signify that she is well. Persistent indi- 
gestion may be the cause of many difficulties. 
4. Study the teacher’s personal equipment. Many dif- 
ficulties are traceable to personal peculiarities, emotional 
peculiarities, habits of work, habits of dress, special abil- 
ities and disabilities. Assistance along professional lines 
is of little value when the difficulty is personal. 
5. Study the teacher’s social equipment. Social dis- 
appointment may result in discouragement and ultimate 
failure. Note home conditions and social activities. An
-P-A-G-E-27
  STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 9 
abnormal social life may leave little time or interest for 
teaching. 
In this analysis there is no thought of building up an 
elaborate filing system. Information, to be of any value, 
must be a part of the supervisor’s working knowledge 
of the situation. Emphasis is placed on ‘‘having in 
mind.’’ Information carefully filed away somewhere will 
be of little value. The general point is that supervisors 
must know their teachers. 
Ill. Srupyine tHe THAcHING 
The supervisor should single out for study the major 
elements of the recitation. As the supervisor studies the 
recitation it is usually best to single out certain of its 
major aspects for consideration. There seem to be six of 
these elements or, from the standpoint of the supervisor, 
six types of evidences to look for in the study of teach- 
,ing. These are: (1) evidences of successful management, 
including attention to physical conditions, the handling 
of materials, and discipline; (2) evidences of a wise selec- 
tion of learning situations, pupil experiences, subject mat- 
ter, etc.; (3) evidences of economical methods of learning, 
including a knowledge of the mental processes involved 
in the several types of learning; (4) evidences of effective 
teaching procedures; (5) evidences of good methods of 
getting work done, including provision for individual dif- 
ferences, organization of work around purposeful activ- 
ities, ete.; and (6) evidences of acceptable standards of 
attainment. 
The supervisor must focus attention upon observable 
evidence. As far as possible the supervisor should focus 
his attention upon observable evidence. Many supervisors 
make mental note of what takes place in general terms, 
such as tact, interest, enthusiasm, organization, skill, ete.
-P-A-G-E-28
10 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK | 
Such terms are very subjective. They connote different 
things to different individuals. They lead to arguments 
and misunderstandings. Frequently, the teacher feels that 
she has been unfairly criticized. If the subjective elements 
must be noted, record also specific examples illustrative of 
the points in mind. A good procedure to make the study 
of the recitation more objective is to list a number of the 
specific teacher and pupil activities observed during the 
recitation. The procedure here recommended to obtain © 
objective evidence about teaching may be illustrated by 
the first of the six elements of the recitation, namely, 
management. Management consists of three items: (1) 
providing proper physical conditions; (2) effective meth- 
ods of handling materials; and (3) control. The physical 
requirements are measurable: the temperature, in degrees; 
the light, in angles and intensities; the ventilation in floor © 
space per pupil or volume change per minute; and seat- 
ing, in inches. Similarly, the handling of materials can 
be studied quantitatively from the standpoint of the time 
consumed or the time wasted in their distribution and 
use. The element of control is more difficult to analyze. 
The general items at the end of this chapter will indicate 
the exact nature of these materials. 
The needs of objective standards. Experience has 
proved that it is possible to keep in mind only a limited 
number of observable points in studying the recitation. 
Many supervisors have devised for their guidance cheek 
lists reminding them of the different types of information | 
needed. The ‘‘items to observe’’ developed by the super- 
visors of the Detroit public schools + and the simpler form 
immediately following this paragraph are good illustra- 
tions of such standards. It is well for the supervisor to 
have some such list of points to observe to guide him in   
2A. 8. Barr and others, Elementary School Standards for the Im- 
provement of Teaching (Edwards Brothers, Ann Arbor, Michigan). 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 11 
the study of the recitation. To be most helpful, such 
items should be written in objective terms, as has already 
been pointed out. The following short list of items, taken 
from the ‘‘Items to Observe in Sewing’’ prepared by 
Miss Julia Grant, Supervisor of Household Arts, Detroit 
public schools, illustrates the type of material found most 
usable: 
. Has each girl her work? 
. Does each girl wear a thimble? 
. Does each girl take a good working position? 
. Do the girls use straight needles? 
. Are pins put in at right angles to the edge? 
. Is the thread well fastened at the beginning and end of the 
seam? 
. Is the work free from knots? 
. Are the rows of stitches or seams straight? QopwD 
aon 
A simple plan for gathering data about the recitation. 
A somewhat simpler procedure is to center the analysis 
on certain of the larger aspects of good teaching. In 
this connection, the following check list has been found 
helpful: 
I. The lesson as a whole: 
1. What is the teacher’s general plan? 
2. What is the teacher’s immediate purpose? 
3. How does the subject matter of the lesson fit into both? 
4. Is the subject matter in harmony with the course of 
study? 
5. Does the subject matter meet pupils’ present and 
probable life needs? 
6. Does the lesson foster right methods of study by 
pupils? 
7. Do pupils know what was expected of them in pre- 
paring this lesson? 
II. The data furnished to the pupils: 
1. Are the pupils dependent upon a single textbook? 
   
-P-A-G-E-30
    
12 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
2. Are maps, globe, exhibits, pictures, blackboard, ete., 
utilized by the pupils? 
3. Are reference books and supplementary texts used as 
sources of material by the pupils? 
4, Are comparisons made and illustrations drawn from 
the pupils’ experiences? 
III. The procedure: 
1. What is the general type to which the lesson belongs? 
2. Is the lesson suited to the aim and to the materials? 
8. Are the children working consciously toward a known 
goal? 
4. Should the teacher have modified her plan during the 
lesson instead of holding to it? 
5. What laws of learning are observed? Violated? 
6. Are the children using correct or incorrect methods of 
study? : 
7. Who is doing the purposing, the planning, the or- 
ganizing, and the judging of values? 
8. Can these children do to-morrow’s work more in- 
telligently? 
IV. Some elements of strength to look for: 
L 
2. Were all of the pupils stimulated to do at least one 
thing well? 
Was the text used to furnish data for the solution of 
a. problem and for establishing effective methods of 
studying? 
. Were the children taught at least one good method of 
gathering data? 
. Did the lesson bring out clearly the danger of hasty. 
conclusions based upon meager evidence? 
. Did the lesson lead pupils to see. the value of supple- 
menting the text from experience? 
. Were problem-solving activities in evidence? 
. Were the children led to understand and appreciate 
some one hitherto unknown truth? 
. Were the pupils led to enjoy new beauties in nature, 
in literature, or in art? 
. Were new skills acquired or old skills perfected dur- 
ing the period?  
-P-A-G-E-31
  
STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 13 
V. Some elements of weakness frequently observed in recita- 
tions : 
1. The teacher made use of an incorrect lesson activity; 
that is, she taught a development lesson when her class 
should have been given a practice lesson, or, perhaps, 
a review lesson; or, she gave a review of a topic when 
practice or drill was needed. . 
2. Memory was overemphasized in the recitation. 
» 3. The teacher did the organizing instead of the pupils. 
4. One or two pupils did all the talking. 
4.5. The subject matter was treated jas if all facts were of 
equal importance. 
6. The teacher, in trying to meet individual needs, neg- 
lected the majority of the class. 
7. The teacher, in test and drill exercises, did not make 
use of devices requiring a maximum amount of mental 
activity and general participation of the members of 
the class. 
8. The teacher passed judgment upon the correctness of 
statements, robbing the pupils of this privilege. 
9. The real subject matter of the lesson lay outside of the 
text and was not touched upon. 
(10. The pupils were not the actors; they ‘were passive 
"spectators. 
11. There was little or no problem-solving; hence, little 
or no reflective thinking. 
12. Modern methods of teaching were seemingly unknown 
to the teacher; such as, diagnosis before drill, indi- 
vidual practice to meet individual needs, ete. 
13. The lesson plan did not develop effective and economi- 
eal habits of study. 
\14. The pupils did not ask questions. Pupils who are 
really thinking ask questions. 
Not all of these items can or should be checked for any 
given lesson, but each item suggests certain elements that 
make for skill or for the lack of it. 
Summary. The ability to analyze a teaching situation 
eritically comes only with training. Many supervisors 
“have eyes and do not see, ears and do not hear.’”’ In 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
studying a teaching situation, note its three major ele- 
ments: the pupils, the teacher, and the teaching. In mak- 
ing record of what is observed, note observable teacher 
and pupil activities. Subjective comments are misleading 
and difficult to interpret. No elaborate remedial program 
should be initiated until a careful analysis of the major 
elements noted above has been made.

-P-A-G-E-44
  26 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
(c) Does the teacher fix attention upon the analysis 
of movements when analysis seems profitable? 
(While it is helpful at the beginning to think 
of each separate movement, attention may be 
given too long to details.) 
(d) Does the teacher fix attention upon training in 
elementary movements when that procedure 
seems profitable? (When training in elemen- 
tary movements is attempted, it should be 
provided as encountered in a complex act and 
not as isolated training.) 
(e) Does the teacher fix attention upon the

(f) Learning is much quicker if the material is 
repeated with the intention of learning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 27 
(g) Incorrect learning makes correct learning 
more difficult. 
(h) Associations should be made purposely and not 
left to chance. 
(i) Clear comprehension of ideas is necessary to 
permanent retention.

(a) Do the pupils waste time because of their in- 
effective methods of locating information 
(experience) in books, magazines, ete.?

nique at the proper time? (For example, the 
exercise may call for the collection of facts 
from many sources, the mastery of a given 
unit of subject, reading for enjoyment, etc.)

learning, problem solving, the acquisition of general and abstract 
meaning, and the development of habits of enjoyment for other sug- 
gestions. 
(c) Is the work of the class so organized that sub- 
ject matter is mastered in its functional 
relationships? (Study and memorization of

drill : 
(a) Is the class led to appreciate the need for skill 
by setting a worthwhile problem that can- 
not be solved until skill is acquired? 
(b) Is the class led to an appreciation of the skill 
which is to be acquired by the aid of illus- 
trations, models, and demonstrations? 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
(c) Does the elass activity conform to the laws of 
habit formation: (1) adequate repetition of 
the desired function to facilitate learning,

STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 29 
each suggestion and to think out its possible 
consequences ?

information systematically? 
‘ (g) Does the teacher assist pupils to analyze data 
into elements when this procedure seems 
profitable?

stock” of the results from time to time? 
(k) Does the teacher assist pupils to devise and use 
tabular and graphic methods of representa- 
tion? 
(1) Does the teacher stimulate pupils to express 
concisely tentative conclusions derived from 
time to time? 
(m) Does the teacher stimulate pupils to verify 
their conclusions? 
6. When the activity is one involving the acquisition of 
general meanings, does the teacher strive to develop 
definite, clearly defined, vivid concepts, by: 
(a) Supplying fundamental (elemental) motor 
experiences (for example, “stepping off” a 
rod, lifting sixteen ounces, constructing a 
model, ete.) ? 
(b) Recalling previous personal experiences? 
(For example, a tiger may be defined by 
selecting some qualities from known members 
of the eat tribe and combining them with 
qualities of size and weight derived from other 
objects. ) 
(c) Recalling familiar examples selected to bring 
out common characteristics? (For example, 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  30 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
the meaning of matter might be derived from 
familiar examples embodying the concept.) 
(d) Adding greater detail? (For example, the 
Struggle for Independence takes on meaning 
when details are given. Details are for back- 
ground and are not to be memorized.) 
(e) Developmental exercises to give experiences 
out of which definite concepts may be derived? 
(For example, the word tact may be used in 
a dozen different sentences.) 
(f) Exact definition where exact definitions are 
essential? (For example, technical terms: in 
geometry, line, surface, square; in economics, 
wealth, capital, etc.; in physics, work, heat, 
mass need to be defined. Aid the pupils to 
keep summarizing the meaning or rule 
which they are gradually building up, 
eventually reaching a clear, concise statement 
of it.) 
(g) Practice in the use of the term, principles, or 
rule? (Provide well-selected exercises to give 
pupils practice in recognizing and using the 
new idea in new complex situations.) 
7. When the activity is one of developing habits of 
enjoyment : 
(a) Does the teacher show unmistakable evidences 
of a real appreciation of the thing taught? 
(b) Does the teacher utilize materials suited to the 
stage of development that the pupils have 
reached? (Relatively. simple activities are 
better to begin with than advanced, intricate 
ones. ) 
(c) Do the pupils feel that the activity is im- 
mensely worth while for them? 
(d) Is information about the object supplied when 
information aids appreciation? 
(e) Does the teacher avoid detailed analysis, dis- 
section, and criticism when the end sought is 
enjoyment? 
(f) Does the teacher subordinate drill, technical 
skill, and analysis of technique to whole-  
-P-A-G-E-49
  
STUDYING THE TEACHER AT WORK 31 
hearted enjoyment except where the end sought 
is an understanding of technique? 
(g) Are there evidences of a conscious attempt to 
surround pupils with an abundance of desir- 
able leisure-time activities from which they may 
choose? (Constant association with enjoyable 
activities brings a taste for them.) 
(h) Is the appreciation lesson so taught as to 
arouse within pupils feelings of satisfaction, 
pleasure, and enjoyment? 
(i) Does the teacher so present each activity that 
the pupils are stimulated to further activity?

enjoyment of those leisure-time activities prac- 
ticed by ordinary, well-behaved, cultivated 
people? 
V. The Selection and Organization of Subject Matter

studied of vital importance as determined by accept- 
able principles of curriculum construction? 
2. Are the activities, pupil experiences, and topics 
studied those relatively most important for the pupils 
with whom they are used? (The question is not 
whether such topics are of worth, but of what 
relative worth. The teacher should distribute time 
according to relative values.) 
8. Are the activities, pupil experiences, and topics 
studied adapted to the individual capacity, training, 
and maturity of the pupils with whom they are used 
(Not too easy or too difficult) ? 
4, Are the activities, pupil experiences, and topics 
studied thoughtfully varied to offer training through 
the use of type experiences: (a) observing, (b) doing, 
(c) reading (study), and (d) thinking (problem- 
solving) ? 
5, Are the activities, pupil experiences, and topics 
studied so organized that they can be easily mastered? 
(a) Are the units of instruction organized psycho- 
logically; that is, in terms of the pupils’ 
previous experience?
-P-A-G-E-50
  32 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
(b) Are the units of instruction organized logi- 
cally; that is, in terms of the logical develop- 
ment of the subject itself? 
(c) Are the units of instruction organized 
functionally; that is, in terms of activities and 
problems by which information is used in its 
functional relationships? 
VI. Opportunities for Social Growth

applied when the work is such that pupils are to 
follow a discussion led by the teacher or by a mem- 
ber of the class.) 
3. Do the pupils show evidences of concentration? 
(This criterion is to be applied when the work ob- 
served is a study period.) 
VIII. Evidence of a Scientific Method 
1. Does the teacher take an inventory of each indi- 
vidual’s ability before and after teaching? 
2. Does the teacher obtain definite measures of educa- 
tional progress?

CHAPTER III 
HELPING THE TEACHER 
Paving the way for helpfulness. In the preceding 
chapter the methods of obtaining accurate information 
about the pupil, the teacher, and the teaching were con- 
sidered. Having arrived, through a study of the situation, 
at an understanding of the facts of the case, the next 
step, which we shall discuss in this chapter, is }how to 
help the teacher. /This involves studying the facts, plan- 
ning a suitable remedial program, and leading the teacher 
through conference to understand and codperate in the 
realization of this program. There is no supervisory 
activity that demands better judgment, greater insight 
into human nature, and more skill than this of ascertain- 
ing the true situation and leading the teacher to improve- 
ment. 
The supervisor’s preparation for the conference. The 
conference should be preceded by a period of careful 
preparation, for the constructive criticism of teaching 
presents a difficult task. As has already been pointed out, 
the supervisor might well proceed as does the physician. 
The medical practitioner who visits a sick room observes 
the patient closely and expertly. At the conclusion of 
his visit he may leave simple remedies to alleviate dis- 
comfort. If the case is at all a serious one, he goes to 
his study and reviews the recorded observations, arrives 
at tentative conclusions, and compares his conclusions with 
those of other medical authorities before he makes any 
definite recommendations. Not until he has done this, and, 
37 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
perhaps, not until he has made a second visit to observe 
the patient, does he consider himself competent to pro- 
ceed with remedial treatment. Although the situations 
are not quite parallel, the thoughtful supervisor has much 
to learn from medical practice. The supervisor must 
make sure that his suggestions are in harmony with the 
facts, and he must be able to support his recommendaé- 
tions by reference to recognized authorities or scientific 
investigation. 
As a result of his deliberations upon any teaching situ- 
ation, the supervisor, prior to the conference, should have 
clearly in mind the facts of the case, the conditions con- 
tributing to these facts, and a plan of procedure. From 
his study, also, the supervisor might have in mind the 
teacher’s probable reaction to suggestions, and the best 
methods of getting her to understand the recommenda- 
tions which he has to offer. It is also well to have noted 
prior to the conference two or three major elements of 
strength in the work of this teacher and perhaps a lesser 
number of shortcomings. [Finally, it is advisable to select 
from the many things that might come into the discussion 
a few points for emphasis. In general, the supervisor 
should have thought completely through the situation 
before entering upon the conference. 
The conference with the teacher. In conferring with 
the teacher, the supervisor must first of all create a 
friendly atmosphere. The conference must not be an in- 
quisition, The kindest and most professional spirit must 
prevail. Much depends upon the spirit with which this 
task is performed. It must be purely impersonal and 
must be regarded as a means to increased instructional 
skill. The orthodox approach in a conference is to ex- 
press appreciation of the strong points of the recitation, 
acknowledging the teacher’s grasp of those educational 
principles of which good use was made. This is a satis-
-P-A-G-E-57

factory initial move, provided that what is said has a 
factual foundation. 
The criticism of teaching a difficult task. Probably the 
best way for those who have not had supervisory experi- 
ence really to appreciate the difficulty of conferring with 
teachers is to recall the experience of giving some friend 
a word of advice. Most persons have had this experience 
some time or another. At the best, it is a hazardous 
undertaking. (And because of this human factor, the 
criticism of teaching is one of the most perplexing tasks 
that the supervisor has to perform. It is one thing to 
see ways of improving teaching, and quite another to 
tell the teacher about them. Because of the unpleasant 
nature of the duty, the supervisor is likely to delay action 
until too late. Cubberley, in speaking of the principal 
and the criticism of teaching, says:1 ‘‘Teachers are per- 
mitted to continue in wrong practices, even when they 
mean ultimate failure, because the principal dislikes the 
duty of changing their methods by constructive advice. 
This is not fair to the teacher or to the children under 
her, and is a clear evasion of duty by the principal.’’ 
Many supervisors are blind to the reactions of teachers 
to their suggestions. Many supervisors, intent upon the 
improvement of teaching, have been unaware of the re- 
actions of teachers to their suggestions. They have given 
little or no thought to how they might make their sug- 
gestions more effective. The trouble with a great many 
individuals in authority is that they are too self-centered. 
They forget to observe how the other persons react. A 
good exercise in this connection is to stop in the middle 
of a conference and say to yourself, ‘‘I wonder what the 
other fellow is thinking about?’’ Or, better still, offer 
a suggestion to some one, and then ask him to tell you

  40 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
just what went on in his mind while you were talking. 
If the individual happens to be of the ‘‘brutally frank’’ 
type, you may get the revelation of a lifetime. 
Some supervisors do not seem to know what to do. 
The following statement by Cubberley, quoted from The 
Principal and His School, summarizes certain rather com- 
mon supervisory mistakes : # 
Some principals do not seem to know what to do; others have 
the idea that they are to act as detectives. The result is much 
misdirected effort and many mistakes. A common defect in the 
work of many principals who attempt to give some supervision 
is that they seem unable to offer constructive service to teachers 
after their visits. Some only criticize; many only observe and 
go away, leaving their teachers entirely in doubt as to what they 
may have thought of the work they saw. The principal forms 
his opinion of the teacher and keeps it to himself; the teacher 
in turn does the same to him. In consequence it not infrequently 
happens, in our cities, that a teacher is recommended for dis- 
missal by a principal who has never made any definite attempt 
to help her, and who perhaps has never given her to understand 
that her work was other than satisfactory. Many a teacher’s 
professional career would be quite different if she were taken in 
hand from the start by a strong principal, and helped to a firm 
foundation based on sound pedagogical procedure. 
The supervisory function is sometimes exercised in a 
harsh, severe, and dictatorial manner. Continuing the 
quotation, Cubberley says: * 
The supervisory function is sometimes abused, in that it is 
exercised in a harsh, severe, and dictatorial manner. “You do 
it this way”; “You should have done it this way”; “Don’t do it 
that way”; “You don’t do it right”; “You fail to get results,” 
are types of supervisory criticisms not infrequently given. 
Notes are sometimes left on the teachers’ desks, in criticism of 
lessons observed, which lead to weeping on the part of the teacher. 
Some principals seem to visit only at times when conditions are 
2K. P. Cubberley, The Principal and His School, pp. 432-433, 
*Tbid., pp. 433-434,

unusual, as though their aim was to detect the poorest work done. 
Principals have been reported as having entered classrooms 
with a stenographer, taken down the words of teacher and 
pupils, left the room without comment, and never to have men- 
tioned the work seen to the teacher afterward. Principals have 
also been reported as seldom visiting a classroom exercise except 
toward spring, about the time they would be called upon by the 
board of education to recommend teachers for dismissal. At 
that time they visit certain teachers for a whole day at a time, 
take notes, and offer no comments or suggestions. 
Many teachers feel that criticism is faultfinding. 
Knowing the attitude of some principals and supervisors, 
there is little wonder that teachers sometimes feel that 
supervisors visit for the purpose of ‘‘criticizing.’’ This 
is indicated by the very common question, ‘‘ What criti- 
cisms have you to offer?’’ Furthermore, the first super- 
visory officer with whom the prospective teacher comes in 
contact is the ‘‘eritic’’ teacher. Soon after her first regular 
teaching she is ‘‘inspected,’’ and later ‘‘criticized.’” What 
else should we expect? As long as this attitude prevails 
among teachers, supervisory assistance will fail. 
The word ‘‘criticism’’ is an unfortunate one. The 
word criticism connotes judge, judging, or judgment. In 
one sense the word implies critical examination and un- 
favorable comment. The supervisor thus becomes, in com- 
mon parlance, the judge or critic. Although it is true 
that he is the judge, he is more than that. He is the 
helper, the servant, the source of comfort. Although the 
first notion of supervision is important, it should not 
overshadow the second. We shall use the term in this 
discussion to cover the twofold function of criticism. 
The attitude of the teacher is important. A great deal 
depends upon the attitude built up in the mind of the 
teacher by the supervisor. To paraphrase a statement of 
Kilpatrick’s, visitation followed by satisfaction builds up, 
but visitation followed by annoyance tears down. Thorn-
-P-A-G-E-60
42 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
dike has pointed out the importance of feelings of satis- 
faction and dissatisfaction in learning. The principal or 
supervisor whose presence sets the teacher at ease and 
stimulates her to do her best work is a valuable asset 
to a school system. The supervisor whose visits are looked 
upon with fear and trembling, who enters the classroom 
with a cold, judicial attitude, and who makes his presence 
felt as a state occasion, has by his very manner minimized 
the value of his visit. 
The attitude of the supervisor is reflected in the chil- 
dren. Even the children catch the spirit of the super- 
visor. The smile of the supervisor when he enters the 
room is to them encouragement beyond belief. They are 
eager to do their best. They coax the teacher to have 
speed drills in arithmetic or to permit them to read. 
They are anxious that the supervisor shall know the 
progress that they have made since his last visit. Lists 
of spelling words, arithmetic papers, drawing lessons, and 
penmanship practice are exhibited to him as he passes 
between the rows of seats. Small hands reach out to 
touch him as he passes by. ( Contrast this with the attitude 
ereated by another supervisor. The pupils refuse to recite. 
They are willing to accept failure rather than talk. They 
look upon the supervisor’s entrance with dread and heave 
a sigh of relief when he leaves. Children are really quite 
expert in sizing up a situation. They react very quickly 
to what they see. One very much loved supervisor would 
enter a classroom and take a seat with the children on 
the recitation bench. She entered into the spirit of the 
work, and often competed with the children in their 
drills. Her presence stimulated both pupils and teacher 
to their best work. 
The attitude of some supervisors toward errors in 
teaching is wrong. Another mistaken notion in giving 
assistance to the teacher is the attitude assumed by some 
   
-P-A-G-E-61
  HELPING THE TEACHER 43, 
supervisors toward errors in teaching. For some reason, 
the appearance of an instructional shortcoming 1s a source 
of irritation. Just why this is so is not clear. (Teaching 
difficulties should certainly be expected, and it is the 
supervisor’s function to give assistance. If difficulties 
persist, it may be the supervisor’s fault and not neces- 
sarily that of the teacher. Nevertheless, teachers are some- 
times made to feel that they are failing even when they 
exhibit only the slightest of weaknesses. Probably this is 
due to the manner in which the supervisor bestows appro- 
bation. (He frequently bestows it only upon those with 
marked excellences.) In any case, the same warm, helpful, 
sympathetic interest must be maintained toward all teach- 
ers. Errors in teaching are not personal offenses against 
supervision. 
The conference should be forward-looking. In any 
conference, the entire movement should be forward-look- 
ing. The analysis of a lesson is of value only as it affects 
future teaching situations. The evil effects of mistakes 
in the lesson should not, in general, be dwelt upon. The 
time might much better be spent upon constructive plans 
for future lessons. The teacher who finds her lessons torn 
to pieces, and who is left without substitute procedures, 
unless she possesses remarkable resourcefulness, is dis- 
couraged and resentful. 
In looking to the future, the teacher should not merely 
be told what to do and how to do it. The results of such 
a conference may be better teaching, but not a stronger 
teacher. The teacher becomes merely the agency through 
which the supervisor raises the level of instruction. Many 
teachers have learned to depend too much on instructions 
from supervisors. This is indicated by their comments 
concerning the kind of supervisory help that they desire. 
In Morrison’s report, ten teachers indicated that they 
wanted more specific plans or methods given to them by
-P-A-G-E-62
44 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
the supervisor, six asked for better or more definite out- 
lines of work to be done, and five suggested the value of 
group meetings where the assistant superintendent or 
supervisor might give more specific instructions. Only 
three wanted supervisory help that would help them 
to grow.* ; 
Teachers should be led to analyze and evaluate their 
own recitations. A much higher type of conference is 
that in which the supervisor, by skillful questioning, 
leads the teacher to discover for herself the major ele- 
ments of strength and weakness in her procedure, and 
to devise means of improvement. The conference should 
lead the teacher to analyze, evaluate, and plan for the 
future. Self-analysis by the teacher is of vastly more 
value of her as a meaus of growth than the acknowledg- 
ment of any number of shortcomings, once they have been 
pointed out to her. By merging his own personality into 
the common problem, the supervisor can, in a subtle way, 
set the teacher upon a program of self-improvement. Gray 
suggests a device frequently employed in developing self- 
criticism : ° 
After a drill recitation has been observed, a supervisor hands 
to the teacher a copy of an outline containing the important 
points which should be considered in a given type of recitation, 
with the request that she review her own procedure and estimate 
her own efficiency as accurately as she can on each point. An 
appointment for a conference is then made. During the con- 
ference, the supervisor and the teacher compare notes. The 
strong points of the teacher’s work are commented on, and the 
contributing causes are considered. The weak points are dis- 
eussed and remedial measures are suggested. Differences in the 
judgments of the supervisor and the teacher are frequently 
  *J. C. Morrison, ‘‘Improving Classroom Instruction,’’ Elementary 
School Journal, Vol. 20, p. 210. 
°W.S. Gray, ‘‘Improving the Technique of Teaching,’’? Elementary 
School Journal, Vol. 20, p. 273.
-P-A-G-E-63
HELPING THE TEACHER 45 
revealed. These differences form a definite point of departure 
for profitable and thorough-going discussions. It frequently 
happens that the teacher has standards which are too high or too 
low and which can be clarified through discussion. In many cases 
teachers do not have definite clear-cut ideas in regard to the 
essentials of effective teaching. These conferences provide an 
excellent opportunity for the discussion of valid standards. 
Only in this way can teachers become self-reliant. This 
analysis should take place in the conference room, at 
first guided by the questions and suggestions of the 
supervisor. 
The teacher should be encouraged. Speaking on this 
point, Charles B. Gilbert, in a very practical discussion 
of visitation and conference in The School and Its Life, 
says: ° 
The teacher should go away from the conference encouraged 
rather than discouraged. Indeed, a conference of the right sort 
would often remove discouragement. Many a discouraged young 
teacher whose school has become a dreadful burden, and who 
goes home tired in body and mind to spend an anxious and 
sometimes a tearful night, could be saved all this distress if a 
sympathetic principal or supervisor were to spend a half hour 
in private conference with her, bringing the results of his experi- 
ence and his superior wisdom to the reinforcement of her limited 
skill and experience. 
The supervisor should be positive without being opin- 
ionated. The supervisor in the conference must be posi- 
tive without being opinionated, and cautious without being 
colorless. He must know the characteristics of good teach- 
ing, and judge practice in terms of them. By this means 
he can be reasonably sure of the soundness of the advice 
that he has to offer. If disagreements arise between 
teacher and supervisor, the latter must refrain from 
debate. Such a contest is apt to leave either the sting 
  
°C. B. Gilbert, The School and Its Life (Silver Burdett), p. 127.
-P-A-G-E-64
46 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
of defeat or the equally objectionable exultation of vic- 
tory. Discussion is entirely legitimate if impersonal and 
constructive. Discussion clarifies ideas and reveals basic 
principles. If a discussion threatens to become a debate, 
both teacher and supervisor had better leave the matter 
and gather more data until the evidence is sufficient to 
reveal the true conditions. Tradition is the most active 
agency that opposes supervisors, and in the conference 
with the teacher the supervisor must remember the weight 
of sentiment and belief that clings about ‘‘what has always 
been so,’’ and ‘‘what we learned at school.’’ To belittle 
these facts is fatal. Rather must they be respected, the 
elements of truth in them called to the teacher’s notice, 
and reasons for modification based upon scientific evi- 
dence presented. 
The criticism of teaching must be discriminating. Gen- 
eral criticism should be avoided. If the principal or 
supervisor says, ‘‘The lesson was very good,” but fails 
to point out the particulars in which the lesson was 
good, he merely commends. If he says, ‘‘The work is 
poor,’’ and fails to say in what respect, he discourages 
the teacher without: offering constructive assistance. It is 
much better to say, ‘‘The method used in collecting 
papers was very economical,’’ ‘‘The degree of attention 
was marked,’’ ‘‘The explanation of the term charter was 
well given’’; or, ‘‘The amount of time consumed in get- 
ting started was a bit long,’’ ‘‘The class exercise was 
largely questions and answers,’’ ‘‘A few illustrations 
might have been used to good advantage.’’ Discriminat- 
ing comments leave the teacher better equipped to analyze 
her own teaching and to plan for progressive improve- 
ment. 
The criticism of teaching must be constructive. As 
has already been pointed out, criticism must not be mere 
faultfinding. In general, it is unwise to tear down unless 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
HELPING THE TEACHER 47 
there are available better materials with which to build. 
To say to the teacher that a thing is wrong without offer- 
ing a better procedure is merely to make matters worse 
by adding discouragement to wrong practices. Say, in- 
stead, ‘‘Why not try starting the class exactly on time?’’ 
‘“*A procedure that I have found helpful in explaining 
difficult terms is to use familiar examples,’’ ‘‘ An excellent 
substitute for ‘hearing lessons’ is a carefully devised in- 
formal test,’’ ete. 
Criticism must be of a professional nature. The most 
desirable end to attain in the directing of teaching is a 
professional attitude on the part of both the teacher and 
the supervisor. When the physician tells his patient that 
he has a weak heart, the patient not only expresses appre- 
ciation for the service, but pays for it. It would never 
occur to him that he had been insulted, criticized per- 
sonally, or otherwise injured. There is, similarly, on the 
part of the physician a féeling that he has rendered a 
professional service. Submission to treatment on the part 
of the patient represents a degree of confidence in the 
reliability of the physician. This in turn is based upon 
the successful outcome of similar past performances. 
Some patients refuse to accept and finally refuse to act 
upon medical advice. Some patients die. Some deaths 
are due to errors in diagnosis; some are chargeable to 
errors in treatment, and some are chargeable to constitu- 
tional causes for which the patient was not wholly re- 
sponsible.” But in any case, the ag: is wholly 
professional. 
It is true that the physician, unlike the supervisor, 
gives assistance upon call. Many school systems have 
realized this organizational difficulty, and have placed 
‘Emery Filbey, ‘Vocational Interviewing’? (unpublished ma- 
terial).
-P-A-G-E-66
48 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
departmental supervisors on a service basis. The super- 
visor in this type of organization becomes the consulting 
specialist in education. In the free educational clinic pro- 
vided by him, the highest type of service is rendered to 
those in need of assistance. 
The marks of good supervision. Charles A. Wagner 
summarizes the marks of good supervision as follows: ® 
There are three infallible marks of the right kind of super- 
vision: commendation of the good, condemnation of the unsatis- 
factory, suggestion of the better. The supervisor who can see 
nothing to commend in a school room is suffering from something 
serious. It may be physical or mental or moral dyspepsia. It 
may be a sour stomach, an overweening conceit of his own 
ability, or an overwhelming sense of his infallibility. They are 
equally effective in producing irritation instead of inspiration. 
There must be the will to commend, not merely the accidental 
condescension to commend. 
What is commended must be recognizable by the teacher as 
commendable, or she at once loses respect for the supervisor’s 
judgment or for his sincerity. Mere flattery will not serve. A 
sure discernment of the good and the best quality, an unfailing 
recognition of the best ends of effort, and an instant readiness 
to direct the teacher to accepted sources of help, these three are 
needed to give skill and strategic power in commendation of 
teaching procedure. 
McMurry summarizes the characteristics of good 
criticism. After stating that the supervisor is a teacher 
of teachers, and that good methods of teaching apply to 
him as well as to the teachers, MeMurry says: ® 
In the first place, then, criticism will be as adverse as the 
situation requires; but it must also be constructive. Earnest 
teachers are not seeking mere praise; they want help. And they 
will raise no objection to adverse criticism if valuable construc- 
tive criticism follows.

(copyright, 1913, by World Book Co., Yonkers-on-Hudson, N. Y.).  
-P-A-G-E-67
HELPING THE TEACHER 49 
Second: The criticisms offered, both adverse and constructive, 
-are helpful largely to the extent that they are based on reasons— 
such as aims and principles of education—rather than on per- 
sonal authority. To ignore this fact and base statements on 
personal opinion quickly arouses antagonism and defeats the 
objects aimed at. 
Third: Since the principal is desiring to influence the 
teacher’s conduct in class, he has chosen a most difficult task, and 
his ideas must be presented with all possible force. They must, 
therefore, be so arranged that all those bearing upon a par- 
ticular point are brought together in good sequence; there must 
be enough of them, too, to produce a cumulative effect. All of 
them, taken together, must be so ordered that the main sugges- 
tions seem few and simple. In short, the principal’s ideas must 
be so onganized as to produce conviction. 
Fourth: The lecture form of presentation is as unfitting for 
him as for the teachers. The teacher does not care to be lectured 
to; that is too unpedagogical and undemocratic. Hence the 
principal should raise questions and participate in the answers 
through discussion. ee 
No conference should close until the teacher clearly 
sees her needs. No conference should close without the 
teacher clearly seeing her needs. She should feel that the 
suggestions have been constructive, and that a practical, 
remedial program has been proposed. This is accom- 
plished when the teacher sees her lesson in perspective, 
viewed through the medium of modern educational 
thought, and when she has ceased to worry over petty 
details of class procedure. Such matters as talking with- 
out permission, position of pupils, general disorder, or 
misspelled or mispronounced words have, in general, no 
place in the analysis of teaching. The criticism should 
be based upon infinitely bigger things. Later, if the super- 
visor so desires, minor details detracting from the artistry 
of the performance may be mentioned, always keeping in 
mind that the general plan of the recitation is of the 
greatest importance. In general, the teacher should be
-P-A-G-E-68
50 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
left with a definite goal toward which she has been 
stimulated to strive. 
Summary For THE SUPERVISOR 
The consultation with the teacher. The following sug- 
gestive plan for consultation with the teacher is quoted 
from Burton, Supervision and the Improvement of Teach- 
ing, pp. 416, 417: 
1. During the observation and consultation the supervisor must 
preserve the impersonal, objective, scientific attitude. (Sus- 
pended judgment and open-mindedness.) 
(a) Compliment what is good, giving reasons why. Give 
credit for ideas that are new. (Recognition of work 
well done makes adverse criticism easier when it is 
necessary. ) 
(b) Diseuss all errors and corrections on impersonal, 
scientific grounds. Dispose of errors by giving peda- 
gogical and psychological arguments, and by supplying 
the correct procedure. Avoid use of I and you. 
(c) Correct one error at a time. Differentiate between 
errors of routine and the more important ones of teach- 
ing procedure, or professional attitude. 
(d) When a teacher persists in a procedure that is clearly 
wrong, the supervisor must insist tactfully but none 
the less firmly that the correct procedure be given full 
and fair trial. 
2. While the impersonal attitude must prevail in viewing and 
discussing the teacher’s work, there should be a kindly tact 
and sympathy manifested which will assist in putting the 
teacher at ease and in furthering the purposes of consultation. 
(a) The supervisor must expect to win the confidence and 
codperation of his teachers much as the teacher wins 
the same things from the children. 
3. The supervisor must distinguish between his functions as a 
judge and rater of teaching, and as an assistant in bettering 
teaching. 
4. In making final judgments and important recommendations 
apart from the everyday consultation, there must be a careful 
balance of the scientific and the personal factors.
-P-A-G-E-69
  
HELPING THE TEACHER 51 
(a) The politics, religion, “temperamental reactions,” ete., 
of either teacher or supervisor are not legitimate 
elements in supervisory or administrative discussions. 
(b) Specifically this means that a teacher should not be con- 
demned for other things than pedagogical faults. On 
the other hand, she should not be tolerated in the system 
when she cannot or will not adapt herself to recognized 
and clearly demonstrable pedagogical procedure. 
5, The consultation, except on very minor points, should not take 
place in the presence of the pupils. 
(a) Whenever possible, it should not take place immedi- 
ately, but after supervisor and teacher have had a 
chance to think over the details. 
(b) The consultation should be unhurried, but should come 
at a time when both parties are free and not tired. 
(c) It should be in the nature of a give and take discussion, 
and not a monologue by either party. 
Tue TecHNIQvE OF CRITICISM 
1. Getting the facts: 
(a) Make criticisms only after a careful observation and 
analysis (diagnosis) of the teacher’s work. 
(b) Make criticisms only in terms of definite standards 
known in advance by the one whose teaching is being 
judged. 
(c) Remember that there are often several right ways of 
doing a thing. Do not mistake your way for the right 
way. Everything else being equal, the teacher is right. 
(d) Find out what the teacher had in mind to do and to 
what extent she thinks she has succeeded in doing it. 
Probably the teacher knows where the lesson fell short 
and will ask for assistance. 
(e) Ascertain purposes and motives back of action. Failure 
to do this leads to misunderstanding. The teacher will 
say, “If I could have gotten the supervisor to see the 
thing as it was, he would have approved.” 
(f) Settle definitely for yourself that the thing that you 
are about to ask for is what you really want. Occa- 
sionally a supervisor will ask for a socialized recitation 
with pupils marching in rigid line or under complete 
teacher domination.

Get such information as is necessary without resorting

People like to talk when given an opportunity. 
2. Establishing proper attitudes: 
(a) 
(b) 
(¢) 
(d) 
(e) Create a congenial starting point. Look about for a 
point of common interest. Treat the teacher as a 
sensible man or woman. 
Arouse the teacher’s interest. Stimulate her so that 
she wants assistance. 
Set the teacher at ease. Assure yourself that she is 
thinking of the things that you have in mind. Prob- 
ably some incident that occurred just prior to your 
arrival is uppermost in her thoughts. 
Get the teacher’s point of view. Put yourself in her 
place. Imagine how she feels. Picture her mental 
condition. See the problem as she sees it. 
Avoid possible centers of soreness. Do not tactlessly 
blunder into difficulties. 
3. The kinds of criticism to make: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(@) 
(e) 
(f) 
(9) Criticism of the teacher’s work should be painstakingly 
fair, unbiased, and unprejudiced. The supervisor must 
have a reputation for fair and courteous treatment of 
teachers. 
Make criticisms definite, clear-cut, and specific. What 
may appear clear to the supervisor may be mere 
abstractions to the teacher. 
Locate elements of strength. Bring out the best there 
is in the teacher’s work. Sell the individual to himself. 
Center criticism upon the technique of teaching rather 
than upon the personal shortcomings of the teacher. 
Make criticisms according to a definite, logical plan for 
the improvement of the teacher’s technique. Take one 
step at a time. 
Weigh values; center criticism upon the outstanding 
points of the recitation. “To miss the point’—to offer 
a trivial criticism—will surely lose the respect of the 
thoughtful teacher. : 
Make commendatory remarks specific. Criticism ean 
be commendatory, discriminating, and definite. In- 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  HELPING THE TEACHER 53 
stead of saying that the lesson is good, say that skill 
was shown in stimulating pupil interest; the use of 
illustrations was effective, etc. 
(h) Distinguish between essentials and nonessentials. Do 
not squabble over details. 
(i) Express a friendly interest in the teacher’s success. 
Be alert to specific improvements in teaching. 
(j) Criticisms of the teacher’s work should be constructive. 
Mere faultfinding or tearing down of a teacher’s work 
without something better to offer is inexcusable. 
4. How to make criticisms: 
  (a) Criticism should be given in a true sense of helpfulness 
to the teacher. Make service the ideal. Conduct your- 
self in such a manner as to inspire in the teacher the 
feeling that you can be depended upon for wise and 
kindly counsel. 
(b) Take the position of a learner. Do not let your attitude 
suggest master and servant. 
(c) Be infinitely patient. Allow time for growth. The 
evolution of good teaching is a long, slow process. 
(d) Do not rush through the interview. Better wait another 
day than create positive antagonism. 
(e) Do not appeal to authority. The thing should be done 
because it is right and not because it must. 
(f) Respect the other person’s feelings. The brutally frank 
are cruelly disrespectful of the other person’s feelings. 
Say what must be said as an individual might ration- 
alize about it. 
(g) Where shortcomings must be pointed out, point out one 
at a time. The teacher is bewildered and discouraged 
by a fusillade of criticism. 
(h) Occasionally criticism must be positive, direct, and un- 
mistakably plain. For example, a shirking teacher must 
be told to “Get busy or get out.” 
(i) Make criticism informal, incidental, and by the way, 
when possible. 
(j) Make eriticism suggestive and indirect when possible. 
For example, interest the teacher in a book on “The 
art of questioning.” 
(k) Make criticisms in a courteous, businesslike, friendly, 
conversational tone.

  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
(1) Do not say, “You have failed.” Set situations skil- 
fully that will lead the teacher to discover and develop 
her own strong points, and remedy her own short- 
comings. 
(m) Personalities and temperaments will differ widely. 
Make criticisms accordingly. 
5. Results desired: 
(a) Stimulate the teacher to self-analysis, self-criticism, 
and self-improvement. 
(b) Criticism should encourage initiative, independence, 
and responsibility on the part of the teacher. There 
is nothing more deadening than the rigid adherence to 
mandatory plans. 
(c) Strive for the proper attitude on the part of the teacher. 
No teacher should be able to say, “You can’t do any- 
thing to please her.” 
(d) Criticism should lead the teacher to see the importance 
of her work and the dignity of teaching. 
(e) Study the reactions of other people to your remarks. 
Strive for a better technique. Many people are most 
stupid in their observance of human reactions, and 
quite impervious to obvious indications of what other 
persons think. 
(f) Where there are honest differences of opinion, experi- 
ment. Strive honestly for a scientific attitude.

VISITING THE CLASSROOM CHAPTER IV 
Routine factors pertaining to the study and improve- 
ment of teaching. The discussion up to this point has 
neglected a number of general or routine factors pertain- 
ing to the study and improvement of teaching which 
need now to come in for special consideration; factors 
such as when to begin visits, how frequently to visit, 
entering ihe classroom, position in the room, leaving the 
room, records of visits, ete. These matters are closely 
related to the problems already discussed in the preced- 
ing chapters and in many cases condition the success with 
which they will meet. It is the purpose of this chapter 
to summarize as briefly as possible some of the best prac- 
tices in caring for such activities. 
Units of classroom visitation. Some supervisors, par- 
ticularly principals, make it their custom to drop in on 
teachers for just a few minutes. They rarely see the 
whole of a recitation. One such supervisor said, ‘‘I can 
judge the work of a teacher in a five-minute visit.’’ This 
is obviously unfair to the teacher. A complete lesson unit, 
a period of twenty or twenty-five minutes in the elemen- 
tary school, is the smallest legitimate period for observa- 
tion. Better than this, several consecutive lessons, or a 
series of lessons in a subject on consecutive days, should 
be the unit of observation. One supervisor who criticized 
a teacher for her failure to summarize the main points 
in the lesson was informed, to his mortification, tHat this 
had been done after his departure from the classroom. 
56
-P-A-G-E-75
    
VISITING THE CLASSROOM 57 
The amount of time spent by the supervisor in the 
classroom and the number of visits on consecutive days 
will be dete d by the problems that he is studying. 
Perhaps he Tila: know the method of assigning les- 
sons used by the Wacher, the degree of pupil-activity in 
recitations, the social value of the subject matter of prob- 
lems assigned, the aims of the teacher in terms of modern 
can be determined only by remaining through several suc- 
ceeding recitations. If, on ‘the other hand, the supervisor 
wishes to make a study of the teacher’s technique in silent 
reading, or in the teaching of fractions, he will visit the 
teacher at the same hour for several consecutive days. 
ach day the teacher may be met in a conference during 
which the class work is analyzed and evaluated and a 
suggestive procedure is outlined. Each succeeding day 
will be used to follow up the suggestions given and deter- 
mine what refinements of method are necessary. 
The training and experience of the supervisor should 
determine the length of the visits. Burton says that the 
length of the visit should be determined largely by the ; 
training and experience of the supervisor: , 
breferably a supervisor should see a whole recitation at a 
time and a succession of whole recitations before passing judg- 
ment. The more expert the supervisor, the more he can determine 
in a given time. Experienced teachers will always admit that 
a supervisor can judge routine and disciplinary factors in a 
brief visit, but they object to the passing of pedagogical judg- 
ments on the basis of short visits. However, the same expertness 
ean be gained for most of the common types of teaching, and 
short visits, when absolutely necessary, are a fair basis for 
judgment, though not the best. The important factor is the 
training and experience of the supervisor, not the time he spends 
in the room. It is assumed, of course, that the supervisor makes 
himself familiar with all the attendant circumstances, the previ-
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
ous teaching of the class, the type of class, difficulty of the 
supject, place of the lesson in a series, ete. 
When to begin visits. This is something that depends 
entirely upon circumstances. Very frequently an inexpe- 
rienced teacher will fail during the first two or three days 
of school, and by the end of the first week the room will 
present a state of utter confusion. If the principal delays 
visiting until the second week of school, or until the pupils 
and teacher have settled down to regular work, he has 
probably lost an opportunity to save a teacher from a 
disastrous experience. The sane procedure would be to 
visit all inexperienced teachers the first few days of school. 
For visiting the rest of the teachers, it may be well to 
wait until things have settled down a bit, and routine 
administrative matters incident to the opening of the 
school year are disposed of. 
Visiting student teachers in teacher training institu- 
tions presents a slightly different situation from that de- 
scribed above. Nutt has summarized this situation as 
follows: + 
The logical time to begin visiting the work of the teacher is 
the very first recitation that the teacher conducts. The visit 
should be for the whole period, and should continue as time 
permits, until the teacher has thoroughly mastered the situa- 
tion. The visits may then be less frequent, but they should 
continue to be relatively frequent, as long as there is possibility 
of assisting the teacher in overcoming faults and in establishing 
new habits of efficient teaching. The main point for the super- 
visor to keep in mind is that the performance of supervision 
must seek always to further the development of the teacher, and 
never really to get in the way of this development. That is to 
say, all things considered, the teacher and the pupils under the 
teacher should be better off because of the presence of the 
supervisor in the classroom during the recitation. 
  
2H. W. Nutt, The Supervision of Instruction, p. 201.
-P-A-G-E-77
VISITING THE CLASSROOM 59 
The number of visits. The number of visits is condi- 
tioned by such factors as the experience of the teacher, 
teaching ability, projects under way, etc. In’the main, 
these conditions were outlined in the preceding chapters. 
If the teacher is a superior one and interested in the 
experimental study of problems of instruction, it may be 
necessary for the principal or supervisor to visit the 
classroom over long periods of time, visiting at such times 
when critical periods in the solution of the problem may 
develop. If the teacher is inexperienced, it may be neces- 
sary for the principal or supervisor to visit and confer with 
her frequently to the end that she may adapt herself to 
a new situation with a minimum loss to the school system 
and to herself. If the teacher is an inferior one, it may 
be necessary for the principal or supervisor to visit the 
classroom repeatedly, study the case systematically, and 
through a long course of treatment discover for the 
teacher a new and better method of teaching. Finally, 
if the teacher is one of the great mass of those who are 
moderately successful, it may be necessary for the prin- 
cipal or supervisor to visit the teacher as time permits, 
stimulate her often, and lead her to higher levels of 
attainment. The number of visits must, of course, depend 
upon the local situation. 
In practice, the number of visits made by supervisors 
and principals varies. In a report on supervisory visita- 
tion, Gray says: 
The reports that were submitted indicate that there is wide 
variation among supervisors in the frequency with which they 
visit teachers. Some teachers are visited almost daily, while 
others are visited very infrequently. On the average, teachers 
are visited once a month by superintendents and once a week by 
principals. 
A county supervisor says:
-P-A-G-E-78
«< 60: VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
The general plan is to visit each teacher twice a month. This 
is not always possible, but, when necessary to limit visits, an 
attempt is made to visit those teachers in greatest need of help. 
Supervisory visits should be made according to some 
definite plan. Just as there is a necessity for the plan- 
ning of supervisory conferences, the visit too must follow 
some plan. This may have for its objective, first, the 
improvement of teaching in a single grade; (for example, 
the principal or supervisor may be interested in the study 
of the work of all third-grade teachers) ; second, the im- 
provement of teaching through the study of a single 
technique; (for example, the principal or supervisor may 
be interested in the loss of time through poor classroom 
management throughout the building) ; third, the improve- 
ment of teaching through the assistance of individual 
teachers. To this end the principal or supervisor may 
visit frequently and plan systematically to improve the 
work of the classroom. 
“’ Carefully planned visits are most valuable. In dis- 
cussing the value of long-time planning, Cubberley sum- 
marizes the situation in the following terms: ? 
The poorest and most unprofitable type of classroom super- 
vision he can give is the random visitation of classrooms; where 
he “just drops in” to “see what is going on,” and stays for from 
ten minutes to an hour, according to whether or not he finds 
the work interesting. While such supervision is, of course, better 
than none at all, it is far less effective and does both teacher 
and principal far less good, than would carefully planned visita- 
tion. Some such brief and random visitation a principal will 
always want to do, especially at the beginning of a new school 
year, or where a substitute or a new and inexperienced teacher 
is at work, but it should not represent his regular procedure. 
During the first week of school it may be the best kind of visita- 
tion, as the principal can thus quickly get a line on the school 
and the work of its teachers and children. There will iso be 
2E. P. Cubberley, The Principal and His School, p. 438.  
-P-A-G-E-79
  VISITING THE CLASSROOM 61 
other times throughout the year when the principal will want 
to drop into the classrooms for a few minutes at a time to see 
how things are going, and to get a measure of the health and 
sanitary conditions, the atmosphere of work, and similar items. 
A few minutes, though, will usually be sufficient for such inspec- 
tional visits, and not many of them will be needed after a school 
is well under way. School inspection would be a much better 
term to apply to such work than school supervision, for it is not 
school supervision in any real-or helpful sense of the term. 
The following schedule gave two visits to each teacher 
within a week of time. These visits were not all that were 
made by the principal, but they were made to study 
methods of a particular subject. Each visit included a 
study period supervised by the teacher. The schedule is 
as follows: *

Preparation for the visit. Miss Olive Gray, in speaking 
of rural supervision, offers the following suggestion on 
preparing for the visit: * 
In preparation for the visit it is usually helpful for the super- 
visor to write or telephone the teacher of her coming in order 
that the teacher may have definitely in mind the problems on 
which she wishes help, may have at the schoolhouse necessary 
materials for work, and may arrange the work of the day in such 
a way as to get the most help possible. A letter to the local 
trustee, who often lives on the road to the school, puts him in a 
codperative frame of mind, and makes it possible to get the 
eommunity point of view of the school. 
A careful review of the notes of the previous visits, of the 
suggestions left, and of the memoranda of “things to do and 
look for next time” serves to recall conditions in the school. The 
doing of the things listed probably requires some preparation 
or collection of materials. The supervisor needs to carry with 
her, in addition to these materials, her “Guide to Observation,” 
material for note-taking and for writing suggestions, a bibliog- 
raphy of helpful books with addresses of publishers, possibly 
copies of some books, addresses of sources of teaching appliances, 
at least a few pieces of school work collected from other schools, 
and whatever state bulletins are needed for answering teachers’

Local Undertaking,’’ Elementary School Journal, Vol. 33, March,

  64 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
and trustee’s questions. For her own use she needs a map of 
the county and sufficient money for emergencies. 
The teacher and the visit. In some schools the coming 
of the supervisor is a notable event. Burton describes the 
situation thus: *® 
All teachers are familiar with the stir created by the appear- 
ance of a supervisor. How quickly the news spreads through 
the building, sometimes through the medium of innocent-appear- 
ing messages carried by pupils, sometimes by no apparent means 
at all! Such a scurrying and cleaning up ensues, such as 
erasing of blackboards; such a preparation of special work! 
How carefully the time is calculated so that the best work can 
be in progress when the door opens! This situation betokens 
a badly mistaken idea regarding the function of supervision. 
Teachers and supervisors both are in part to blame. Attention 
has been focused on the administrative phase of the supervisor’s 
rating power, while his most vital function, improving the teacher, 
has been overlooked. 
Visits announced and unannounced. This topic is not 
an important one, once the true function of supervision 
is understood by supervisor and teacher alike. If super- 
vision is conceived in a spirit of helpfulness, it matters 
little whether visits are announced or unannounced. 
When supervision was inspection, and the teacher’s future 
depended on the outcome, the situation was different. | 
From the point of view of the teacher, visits are invited 
and uninvited. One of the best indications of the help- 
fulness of supervision is the number of visits-on-call. At 
least the attitude should be such that visits are welcomed 
and not feared. 
Entering and leaving the room. Obviously, the super- 
visor should enter and leave the room in such a manner 
as to cause a minimum amount of disturbance. The pur- 
pose of the visit is to help the teacher to better teaching, 
* William H. Burton, Supervision and the Improvement of Teaching, 
pp. 405-406.  
-P-A-G-E-83
VISITING THE CLASSROOM 65 
and not to break up the recitation by announcing his 
arrival. The mere presence of the supervisor creates a 
social situation difficult enough for the average teacher 
to overcome. What the supervisor really wants to see is 
teaching done under normal conditions. The manner of 
entrance of many supervisors makes this an impossibility. 
Nutt has well stated the situation as follows: °® 
The supervisor often has to enter the classroom after the 
beginning of the recitation. He should enter in such a manner 
as to attract as little attention as possible. The supervisor 
should not intentionally become the center of attraction as soon 
as he enters the room. The writer has seen a supervisor come 
bursting into the room in the midst of a recitation, interrupt 
the whole procedure to say, “Good morning, boys and girls,” 
and “Good morning, Miss X.” Then would follow a few minutes 
of animated consultation with the teacher or some stagy fussing 
around the teacher’s desk before finally settling down and allow- 
ing the teacher to go on with the work that had been interrupted. 
Presumably the only justification for such a cyclonic perform- 
ance was an attempt to create a social situation and teach the 
children good manners. The real effect, however, was that of 
making it apparent to everyone that the supervisor had arrived, 
and his majestic presence must be properly greeted and recog- 
nized before the work in hand could proceed properly. His 
show of enthusiasm and his fussing around before the pupils 
were all for effect. He wished to seem important, and to make 
his visit seem to contribute immediately something noticeable 
to the life of the school. The real fact is that he contributed 
little else than a diversion. Diversions may be good things 
occasionally, but much better devices than well-paid supervisors 
could be employed to create highly interesting diversions. 
The arrival of the supervisor, the place he occupied in the 
classroom, and his departure should all be in keeping with the 
first principles of technique; namely, that the supervisor should 
exist for the sake of the teacher and pupils. The greater the 
power and efficiency of the supervisor, the less conspicuous his 
presence needs to be in visiting the teachers in the classrooms. 
The person who resorts to making a spectacular display of his 
  
°H. W. Nutt, The Supervision of Instruction, pp. 201-203. 
   
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
performance of visiting has little to commend him, for he lacks 
valid means of making his work felt. In other words, it is just 
a form of bluffing to hide inefficiency. Here, as in most cases, 
the person who seems to do the least is usually doing the most, 
and vice versa. 
The position of the supervisor in the classroom, The 
supervisor should stand or sit in such a position as to 
have a good view of what is going on, at the same time 
appearing as inconspicuous as possible. Rooms best suited 
for visitation are those equipped with visitors’ chairs and 
an entrance at the rear where visitors may come and go 
without unduly disturbing the activities of the classroom. 
The supervisor who sits at the teacher’s desk has created 
a difficult teaching situation. The teacher is probably 
embarrassed, and the attention of the pupils drawn from 
the teacher and the lesson to the supervisor. A much 
better place is behind the class, at the rear of the room. 
The teacher should neither feel obliged to locate the ‘‘place 
in the book,’’ nor otherwise break the continuity of the 
recitation. A nearby pupil may very properly supply 
the supervisor with such information as he needs. Like- 
wise, the taking of notes often embarrasses the teacher 
and renders her work less effective. A check list is some- 
times a helpful device in recording specific observations 
inconspicuously. The supervisor should, however, upon 
leaving the classroom, fill in specific examples and other 
information to make the record complete. 
A report by the education committee of the Chicago 
Principals’ Club has the following statement to make on 
the place of the principal in the classroom: * 
A word might be said about the participation of the principal 
in the activities going on while he is in the room. The safest 
thing is to keep “hands off,” unless he is drawn very naturally 
into the proceedings. Then a well-placed question or comment   
* Chicago Principals’ Club, Bulletin No. 1, ‘‘Supervision,’’ 1923.
-P-A-G-E-85
  VISITING THE CLASSROOM 67 
may prove exceedingly suggestive and helpful. The alert teacher 
is often helped more on the side of method by such a question or 
comment in the actual schoolroom situation than she is by many 
discussions in teachers’ meetings. The skill of the principal is 
evidenced by his ability to make such a contribution without in 
any way belittling the teacher’s ability in the eyes of the class 
or making her feel a loss of confidence in herself. 
Records of visits. Most supervisors are agreed that 
some form of record is helpful. Whatever the form of 
the record, it should register the essentials of the visit 
with a minimum expenditure of time. Some supervisors 
use a card and a check list as follows: 
SuprERvisors’ Visit REcorD AND CHECK List 
Teacher 
Lesson 
Items Observed 
(Indicate numbers from check list here) 
Points of Strength 
Elements of Weakness

  Superintendent Charles A. Wagner has recommended 
the use of an observation pad combining with it the check- 
list idea. He describes the procedure as follows: ° 
These definite observations and judgments are made and re- 
corded on standard merits or excellences. This is quite different 
from forming a general impression and registering that in 
“recollection.”

Some principals and supervisors, upon their return to 
the office, follow the procedure of dictating or writing 
reports summarizing the recitations observed. A number 
of examples of this type of record will be found in the 
Twelfth Yearbook, Part I, National Society for the Study 
of Education. Several of these are given below: ® 
May 9, 1912 
Grade 7 
Mr. R. 
I visited the room several times, and saw parts of spelling, 
history, and arithmetic. In every case the teacher was hearing 
recitations, and it seemed that all the preparation necessary for 
such work as he was doing could have been made in half an hour. 
The spirit of the class was pretty good and they had the attitude 
of attention. There was, however, no genuine interest or any- 
thing to be interested in. 
In the spelling, rules and book statements concerning prefixes 
and suffixes were given by the class when called for, but there 
was left on the board without criticism or discussion the follow- 
ing list of words written by one girl: “sensor, migrator, interior, 
anchor.” 
In discussion later with Mr. R., I pointed out to him that a 
wise discussion of those four words would have been more valu-

able than anything he did in the class. The first word was 
misspelled; three of them, although they ended in or, did not 
show the use of that suffix; and the fourth, migrator, is not a 
word in common use. In making sentences using the suflix ness, 
the sentence “The sweetness of the apple is great” was not quite 
satisfactory to the teacher, but “The sweetness of the apple is 
good” was acceptable—showing how formal their thinking was. 
The history lesson was based on some papers which the chil- 
dren had prepared. It was a review—six weeks before the end 
of the year. The children had made lists of American and 
British victories and of American and British generals. All 
they did practically was to read from their papers—not even a 
discussion of relative values. 
In the arithmetic, before they took up their problems on the 
board, the teacher said, “We will take up again our development 
of the subject of customs and duties.” This consisted of the 
following questions: “What do you understand by customs and 
duties?” “Why only on imported goods?” “What kinds of 
duties are there?” “What do you understand by specific duties?” 
“What do you understand by ad valorem duty?” In each ease 
the children seemed to be trying to remember the definitions 
from the book, and the teacher was satisfied with that result. 
I spent an hour talking over this work with Mr. R. I pointed 
out to him that it was bare hearing of recitations, without interest 
or genuine content, and then I took up each lesson in detail and 
showed him one way in which it might be presented so that it 
would be of interest and value. I told him that I thought the 
children’s time was largely wasted, and that they must have been 
more or less bored by the work, and I tried throughout our 
discussion to make him see that good work requires time and 
mental effort in preparation. A large growth and improvement 
are necessary before Mr. R. is a satisfactory teacher.

Mr. R. (same as previous one) 
Arithmetic—The idea of percentage was well developed by the 
use of fractions. ‘The lesson was well planned and the steps 
logically presented. Class were all thinking and in good working 
order.

  72 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Grade 8 
Mr. W. 
I think Mr. W. is improving in his relationship to the chil- 
dren, and slightly in the quality of his teaching. He still shows 
irritation, however, and a tendency to lose his temper in situa- 
tions where he is largely to blame himself. I have pointed out 
to him that almost every loss of temper is a backward step, 
and makes it likely that he will say things to the children that 
approach the character of an insult, at least it would be so con- 
sidered by him if I should say such things to him as he says to 
the children, or if I indicated such an attitude toward him. 
I saw him teach a grammar lesson and a history lesson. So 
far as the quality of the teaching in the grammar lesson was con- 
cerned, it seemed to me that there was little to commend. It 
was purely formal and had no relation that I could see to any 
feeling of need on the part of children for the grammatical 
notion presented. I pointed out ways in which I thought that 
relationship might be made, and pointed out to him also the 
bearing that such work would have upon his problems of disci- 
pline. I suggested dramatization and other interesting compo- 
sition work which might be made the starting point for a good 
deal of his grammar work, especially by way of application. 
In his history work he seemed to me to raise a few genuinely 
vital questions. 
May 25, 1910 
Grade 5 
Miss G. 
My impression of Miss G. as a teacher is that she is generally 
weak, indecisive, and uncertain. Her preparation is not strong, 
nor is her organization, or questions, or ability in handling the 
answers of the children. I nevertheless think that in the first or 
second grade she may do work that would prove fairly satis- 
factory. 
Aprin 25, 1912 
Grade 3 
Miss G. (same as one before) 
I rarely have greater pleasure in a visit. When I first went 
in, Miss G. had about fifteen of her children; the rest had gone

to German. These in the room were reading to each other from 
a book which the teacher supplied, doing this most earnestly and 
seeming to be interested. Later, with this same group, the teacher 
was presenting a poor physiology lesson, but the children were 
working hard on it. 
Then I saw the rest of the class come in, in a most informal 
way, and yet with such perfect order in the best sense, and I 
was extremely pleased. ‘There were forty of ‘them, certainly 
not very clean, and rather poor, difficult-looking children, but 
they sat with bright looks and an attitude of expectancy which 
certainly spoke well for the teacher. They had a good language 
lesson in which all were working, and then they played a story 
which had been told well and with good spirit. I praised Miss G. 
for the kind of work she was doing, and talked over her physi- 
ology with her, showing how she could make it much more 
valuable and interesting. It is fine to see her succeeding and in 
so difficult a place. 
County Superintendent A. G. Yawberg of Cleveland 
describes his systems of reports as follows: 1° 
After the visits in any one building are completed, the superin- 
tendent makes a written report of his observations and sugges- 
tions, three copies of which are made, one for his own file, one 
for the principal of the building, and one for the teacher. This 
report is sent out within a few days, and may be followed by a 
further conference, requested by either the teacher or the 
superintendent.

1. The lesson plan. The plan is satisfactory from every point 
of view. The aims of the teacher and pupils are unusually well 
stated. The subject matter and the method are admirably worked 
out. This is one of the best lesson plans the writer has seen. 
2. General comments: (a) The technique employed was very 
successful. The pupils were led to discover the next steps with-

out being told beforehand by the teacher. Reasons for doing 
things were especially well treated. (b) The class was attentive, 
and the pupils showed skill in carrying into effect the directions 
developed as part of the project. (c) The idea of grouping the 
various phases of attractive clothing into one project seems a 
very good one. (d) Without doubt, this work as it is being 
carried on is a credit to the school and to the community. (¢) The 
following materials ought to be helpful in the department:

Chicago, Illinois (gratis); (2) the Homemakers’ Bulletin,

(4) Langworthy charts, United States Department of Agricul- 
ture, Washington, D. C. ($1 per set). 
The supervisor should not become a mere keeper of 
records. Care should be observed that the keeping of 
records of supervisory visits does not occupy the. major 
portion of the supervisor’s time. As has already been 
mentioned, few if any notes should be taken while the 
supervisor is in the classroom. The use of check lists such 
as are presented in previous chapters will assist the super- 
visor in organizing his thinking, and will direct his atten- 
tion to important features of classroom procedures. The 
records made following teacher visitation should be com- 
plete enough to guide him in the conference with the 
teacher, but should not assume such importance as to 
reduce him to the position of bookkeeper. 
Summary. In this chapter the routine factors pertain- 
ing to classroom visitation are summarized. The need for 
careful planning on the part of the supervisor is empha- 
sized. No detail directly related to success in the teacher’s 
work should be overlooked. Those factors that relate to 
the supervisor’s activities in the classroom, discussed in 
this chapter, are summarized below.*t

SUMMARY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
. Enter the classroom quietly, and disturb what is in progress 
as little as possible. 
. Do not rush across the room, shake hands with the teacher, 
and make a general’ commotion. A quietly nodded “Good 
morning” is less disturbing and just as useful. 
. Preferably sit in the back of the room, or at one side, rather 
than on a chair in front. You want to be a quiet and 
largely an unnoticed observer, and not the center of what 
is going on. Sit at the teacher’s desk or in front only if 
you expect to take charge of the class and conduct the 
lesson. 
. Make your presence in the room as little noticed as possible, 
and gradually train both teachers and pupils to go on with 
their work and pay little attention to your presence. 
. Appear to be an interested observer or listener, entering into 
the spirit of the class work. Do not sit with “a mask on” 
—bored, expressionless, sour—or leave the room with an 
evidence of disapproval. 
. After the novelty of your presence wears off, give attention 
to the teaching process. Try to analyze it. 
. Do not make notes on the lesson in a notebook or on a card 
while in the room, but do this outside after leaving. 
. If the teacher seems to be in difficulty, and needs help, quietly 
move forward and suggest, in an undertone, the right pro- 
cedure. Sometimes a question or two that changes the 
character and direction of the lesson may be all that is 
needed. If the teacher does not bring the lesson around 
right, it may be a good time for you to take the class, and 
yourself demonstrate a better procedure. 
. Always ask the teacher’s permission to break into a recita- 
tion, even with a question; or, if you desire to take the 
class, always let the pupils feel that you have full confi- 
dence in the teacher, and that you continually refer to her 
as in control. 
After a teaching demonstration for a new teacher it is usually 
best to leave the room to avoid any embarrassment to her 
in resuming charge of the class.

  CHAPTER V 
INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 
In Chapter II, ‘‘Studying the Teacher at Work,’’ the 
three dominant factors of the classroom—the pupil, the 
teacher, and the teaching—were analyzed. Chapter III 
discussed the technique of the supervisor in leading the 
teacher through conference to analyze, evaluate, and im- 
prove her own teaching procedures. Chapter IV sum- 
marized some of the general or routine factors pertaining 
to the study of teaching. It is the purpose of this chap- 
ter to present several concrete cases illustrating how 
eertain supervisors actually performed these activities— 
getting the facts, diagnosing the case, and applying proper 
remedial measures. 
The nature of the material to follow. The material to 
follow is composed of: (1) a statement of the general 
setting of the lesson observed; (2) a stenographie report 
of the lesson; (3) the supervisor’s diagnosis of the lesson; 
(4) a stenographie report of the supervisor’s interview 
with the teacher; (5) the teacher’s reaction to the inter- 
view; and (6) a brief analysis of the technique used by 
the supervisor. Note particularly in the study of the 
material which follows how the supervisor conducted him- 
self during the class period, how he diagnosed the case, 
what he said to the teacher, and the manner in which he 
said it. 
The interviews are not model interviews. It should be 
borne in mind that these interviews probably do not 
78
-P-A-G-E-97
  
INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 79 
represent the best or the poorest that these particular 
supervisors are capable of giving. Although the inter- 
views were made by successful supervisors according to 
public-school standards, they are not necessarily models 
to be followed. They are just interviews. Space does not 
permit a detailed report of the many things that really 
took place during the visit and interview which followed. 
It is assumed that the supervisor took the pains to obtain 
the necessary facts. 
Review the principles set forth in the preceding chap- 
ter before undertaking a study of these reports. Before 
undertaking the study of the supervisory reports to fol- 
low, review carefully the material on studying the work 
of the teacher and helping the teacher through confer- 
ence, as given in the preceding chapters. Review especially 
the ‘‘General Standards for the Improvement of Teach- 
ing’’; the outline forms, ‘‘Studying the Teacher’’ and 
“Studying the Pupil,’’ at the end of Chapter II; the 
material on ‘‘The Consultation With the Teacher’? and 
“The Technique of Criticism,’’ at the end of Chapter IIT; 
and the ‘‘Summary Statement,’’ at the end of Chap- 
ter IV. 
How the materials are to be used. The case studies 
reported may be made to serve three purposes: (1) A 
guide to the study and criticism of teaching (the reports 
show how certain supervisors in practice performed their 
functions). (2) A suggestive method of critically analyz- 
ing cases; (questions such as the following are answered: 
How would you diagnose the case? What would you say 
to the teacher?) (3) Source material showing present 
practice in classroom supervision. The critical comment 
which follows at the end of each report is by no means 
complete, and is usually restricted to one or two 
points.

An EiguTu-Grape Cuass iv Arr* 
I. Lesson Setting 
The Federation of Women’s Clubs desired to promote Garden 
Week. To do this a contest was inaugurated to obtain garden 
designs. The contest was opened to all pupils. 
1. Kind of school: The pupils are from good American homes 
offering greater opportunities than the average home. 
2. Teacher: High-school graduate; graduate from state normal 
school; one year at one of the best art schools; charming per- 
sonality, refined, retiring, but self-possessed. 
8. Learning conditions: Semi-basement manual training room, 
fairly well lighted, unattractive because of work benches 
and tools. Surroundings in general do not tend to develop 
a feeling for the beautiful through association except for a 
display of pupils’ drawings and color compositions. 
4, Class activity: A project upon which the pupils are working 
collectively at times and again individually. 
5: Children: The class consists of 30 pupils in Grade 8B. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: A part of the pre- 
vious lesson was devoted to explaining the purpose of the 
contest, and stimulating the pupils to design garden plans. 
7. Material used: Drawing paper 12 by 18, soft drawing pen- 
cil, and eraser. | 
II. Stenographic Report of the Lesson Observed 
Teacher. How many boys and girls have been thinking about 
the garden plans? [Many hands are raised.] | 
Teacher. William, you may tell us what we are going to have 
on our plot. Tell us everything. | 
William. House, walk, plans for garden, flowers. | 
Teacher. Yes, what else? 
Pupil. Garage or barn. 
Teacher. Yes, we will probably want a garage. What else? 
Pupil. A driveway out from the garage. 
Teacher. Yes, that is good.

INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 81 
Pupil. A bird fountain. 
Teacher. That would be pretty. What else? 
Pupil. A cement thing in the alley for ashes. 
Teacher. Yes, that is a good thing to plan on. 
Pupil. A red brick walk would look very quaint. 
Teacher. Yes. Now, boys and girls, remember that to begin 
with we must have the proportion just right. It may not 
seem so worth while to you now, but later on you will 
see that it is important. We have a lot 40 feet by 120 
feet. Your plot on paper measures 5 inches. The length 
is three times the width. Remember, class, 1 inch repre- 
sents 1 foot. On our papers we have a space 5 inches by 
15 inches. 
Teacher. Now, boys and girls, how can we imagine our plot? 
Pupil. Looking down on it. 
Teacher. Yes, show the shape of the house as you would see 
it from an aeroplane. How can we show trees? 
Pupil. Outline just the tops. 
Teacher. Everything goes within our lot line, 5 inches by 15 
inches. 
Teacher. Are there any questions? 
Pupil. May we shadow our trees? 
Teacher. Well, if you think that would look nice, you may. 
Pupil. We could have some shrubs by the porches. 
Teacher. Yes, we could. 
Pupil. Some gardens have pipes through them to water the 
garden. 
Teacher. All right. Now first measure and draw your plot 
on paper. Do not forget your names. [Pupils start to 
work. Teacher moves about the room answering ques- 
tions. As. teacher walks about the room, the pupils raise 
hands asking for individual help. Pupils measure their 
papers. | 
Teacher. Now, boys and girls, maybe you think these plots 
look narrow, but don’t bother about that. Perhaps you 
will need a space to put something else. We want those 
\ plans very plain, and to show just what is your idea. 
~. [Teacher helps several pupils individually.] 
Teacher. That looks very nice, Mabel. [Some of the pupils

Teacher. That is all right, Frank. [Teacher goes to different 
pupils, helps them, and answers questions. | 
Teacher. What did we decide would be a good space? 
Pupil. 5 inches by 15 inches. 
Teacher. Yes, a rectangle 5 by 15 inches represents our lot. 
[Teacher goes about the room again, and is kept busy 
answering individual questions of the pupils. Supervisor 
walks about the room looking at pupils’ work and giving 
individual help to pupils. Pupils are very much interested 
in making plans and are working busily. Principal enters 
room, walks about the room a few moments looking at 
pupils’ work, then leaves. ] 
Teacher. Pretend, boys and girls, that you are buying a lot 
40 by 120 feet. You are putting everything on this lot— 
house, garden, flowers, lawn, and everything. [Some of 
the children talk quietly to each other about their plans, 
while the teacher and supervisor go about the room look- 
ing at papers and giving help.] 
Teacher. Boys and girls, do you want your house to be as 
wide as your lot, or do you want some space on each side? 
Teacher. That is very nice, Allen, Where does your driveway 
come in? Show that. That is the way, John. Now you 
are coming to it. Our time is about up, boys and girls. 
Please put your names on your papers. Frank, will you 
collect the papers in your row? Catherine, you may 
collect the papers in your row. 
Pupil [showing paper to teacher]. Miss ......, is this the 
way? 
Teacher. Yes, Katherine, we will work on it next time. The 
time is about up, boys and girls. Now, children, we have 
a week to think about what we are going to do next time. 
We got a good start to-day. [Several pupils start to ask 
questions. | | 
Teacher. Some of us are rather slow. Aren’t your papers 
ready? Hand in your papers. Girls, get into line. Girls 
pass. Boys, get in line. Boys pass. Walk quietly, boys 
and girls. Gurls, let me see a better line.

III. The Supervisor’s Instructional Diagnosis — 
The project of making a garden plan will probably continue 
through several lessons before being completed. The pupils
-P-A-G-E-101
  
  INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 83 
were enthusiastic and encouraged by the teacher to tell of the 
things that they wished in their garden, thus offering an oppor- 
tunity to the pupils to express their individual ideas. As the 
pupils proceeded to work, they found difficulty in carrying out 
these ideas on paper. The teacher should have anticipated this 
difficulty, and helped the pupils to overcome it by illustrating on 
the blackboard, or by showing fine examples of garden plans, 
and, at the same time, discussing with the pupils the art prin- 
ciples involved in the arrangement of the house, garage, front 
yard, gardens in the back of the house, ete. The lesson as a 
whole did not stress sufficiently the great element of beauty. 
IV. The Supervisor’s Interview 
(Ten minutes between classes) 
Supervisor. What did you think of the lesson, Miss D....? 
Teacher. I thought the pupils were very enthusiastic. Some 
points I found they did not have clearly in their minds. 
Supervisor. What, for instance? 
Teacher. The size of the garden plot. They did not seem to 
understand what they were to do. 4 
Supervisor. Well, what could you have done to make them 
understand more clearly? 
Teacher. I should have given suggestions on the board. 
Supervisor. That would have been a good idea. 
Teacher. They could not visualize the plot. 
Supervisor. One point that could have been worked up a little 
more was the proportion. Do you think you could have gone 
along a little further with that, if you had used illustrations? 
Teacher. Yes, that would have been good. 
Supervisor. They did have the garden width, but they did not 
seem to know just how large to make the house. 
Teacher. No, that is true; we could have talked that up a little 
more. Really, we could have spent almost the entire half- 
hour talking about it. 
Supervisor. I liked the way you encouraged the pupils to tell 
their ideas. 
Teacher. They seemed to be at a loss to know just how to go 
about the plans. 
Supervisor. I think an illustration on the board would have 
helped.
-P-A-G-E-102
  84 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. Yes, I think it would have helped. 
Supervisor. The lesson as a whole was very well worked out. 
It showed that the pupils had thought about it. 
Teacher. Some of the children who have gardens at home know 
just how they should be, while others live in apartments. I 
tell them to imagine just what they would like to have. 
Supervisor. That is a good thing to develop their imaginations. 
Teacher. They are nice boys and girls. 
V. The Teacher’s Reaction to the Interview 
Nore: The teacher has an excellent attitude toward criticism, and 
frequently visits the supervisor’s office. The statement to follow is 
an attempt to give an accurate reaction to the interview. 
On March 19th the supervisor of art visited our eighth-grade 
class, which was beginning a lesson on garden-planning. The 
children were interested, and the lesson seemed to go well. 
Afterwards the supervisor asked me what I thought of the 
lesson. In that way she gave me a chance to give my opinion 
of it. Then she led me to make my own suggestions as to the 
improvement of the lesson. I like that, for it seemed to put us 
on a more friendly and helpful footing. I felt, however, that 
there was nothing very definite brought out that I could profit by 
in another lesson. The real help I received was that of encourage- 
ment. This to my mind is perhaps as vital as any kind of 
criticism, because it is just as helpful to know the good points 
as to know the bad ones. 
VI. Critical Analysis of the Interview 
Where there are a limited number of supervisors and 
many teachers, visits to individual teachers are few and 
far between. Under such conditions the interview, to be 
productive of permanent results, must be unusually skill- 
ful. Whenever possible, the teacher should be free for a 
more extended conference than is possible between classes. 
A review of the supervisory interview here reported indi- 
cates two particularly commendable features: (1) the 
drawing-out of the teacher (self-analysis) ; (2) the limita- 
tion of criticism to one major point. Many supervisors
-P-A-G-E-103
  INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 85 
err by overwhelming the teacher with her many short- 
comings. Probably the greatest weakness of the interview 
was the failure to develop in detail specific methods of 
using illustrations: (1) examples of pupils’ work; (2) 
garden designs from magazines; (3) the use of the black- 
board; (4) illustration from pupil experiences. An effec- 
tive method of follow-up is to forward to the teacher, 
following the interview, niaterials, pictures, samples, etc., 
illustrating concretely how the idea is to be put into 
practice.

II. Stenographic Report of the Lesson Observed 
The class passes into the cooking room. Each girl has a bag 
containing a cap and an apron. The pupils go to the tables and 
immediately put on their caps and aprons. The class is auiet and 
orderly. Each girl washes her hands after putting on the cap 
and apron. 
The teacher looks very neat and attractive in a white apron 
covering her entire dress. 
Teacher [bell for attention]. All right, girls, the time is up 
for washing your hands. [The teacher then calls the roll. 
Each girl answers complete or incomplete. This means 
that she has her uniform complete or incomplete.] 
Teacher. Just one girl absent, and one girl incomplete. This 
is the first time Mary has been incomplete all this term. 
We are going to repeat the lesson of last time. We are 
going to make the hot-water gingerbread again. What 
was the trouble with the gingerbread last time? 
Pupil. It burnt. 
Teacher. Why did it burn? 
Pupil. The oven was too hot. 
Teacher. What was wrong with the oven? 
Pupil. We did not have water in the pan. 
Teacher. What else was wrong? 
Pupil. We did not watch it closely enough. 
Teacher. Yes, we must watch the oven and we must place a 
pan of hot water in the oven. You forgot to do that 
last time. Last time most of our gingerbread was hard. 
What was the trouble? 
Pupil. Too much flour. 
Teacher. Yes, that means that our measurements were not 
correct. How do you measure flour? You do not pack 
it down in the cup, do you? What do you do first? 
Pupil. Sift it. 
Teacher. Yes. Suppose you want 14 cup of flour. How do 
you measure that? 5 
Pupil. You sift it first. 
Teacher. Yes, you must not pack it down. That gets too 
much flour. The recipe calls for % or 1% cup of sifted 
flour. All right, we are all going to remember that this 
time. Our recipe is on page 44. Dorothy, pass the recipe 
books. Girls, with what meal do we serve gingerbread?
-P-A-G-E-105
INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 87 
Pupil. Morning. 
Teacher. How many agree with that? 
Pupil. For supper. 
Teacher. All right, why do we think it would make a good 
dessert for supper? [Pupils raise hands. ] 
Pupils. Because we sometimes have soup for supper. 
Teacher. Is that a good reason? What is it about ginger- 
bread that makes it a good dessert for supper? Is it 
a heavy dessert? No, it is a simple dessert and not too 
rich for us to eat at night. It is all right for luncheon 
or supper. All right, has every one page 44 now? 
[Children turn to recipe in book.] 
Teacher. We are going to use one-eighth of our recipe to-day. 
What would be ¥ of a cup of molasses, Lillian? 
Lillian. Two tablespoons. 
Teacher. All right. Now the next measurement is 4 cup of 
boiling water. How much water, Virginia? 
Pupil. One tablespoon. 
Teacher. How do you know that is one tablespoon? Dorothy, 
how many tablespoons in a cup? [Dorothy hesitates. 
Pupils raise hands. | 
Pupil. Sixteen tablespoons. 
Teacher. All right; in 42 cup how many tablespoons do you 
have? 
Pupil. Hight. 
Teacher. How much flour? 
Pupil. Five tablespoons. 
Teacher. Put that down, five tablespoons. [This is said to a 
pupil at the board who writes down the measurements as 
_ pupils tell them.] 
Teacher. How much soda? Is there any girl here who does 
not know how to measure 4% of a teaspoon of soda? 
Next, 4% teaspoon of ginger. A few grains of salt. 
Melted shortening. How much of that? You would have 
¥% tablespoonful. That is a difficult measurement. All 
right, has everyone the measurements now? Irene, will 
you tell us how to combine the ingredients? 
Irene. First, take all the dry foods. 
Teacher. What are you going to do with those? 
Pupil. Sift them together. 
Teacher. Why, Elsie?  
-P-A-G-E-106
  eras Nem LS Se 
88 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Elsie. So that some of the flour will be in one place and not 
in another place. 
Teacher. In other words, you want the materials correctly 
blended. How will soda make your cake rise? Elsie, 
do you remember how we explained that last time? Who 
remembers? What did we use with soda last time? 
Baking powder is made up of soda and cream of tartar. 
All right, we must have something to take the place of 
cream of tartar. What takes the place? 
Pupil. Molasses. 
Teacher. Yes. What is in molasses to take the place of cream 
of tartar? Do you remember? Anybody? Do you re- 
member that we said there is acid in molasses. Acid reacts 
with soda. It takes the place of sour milk or cream of 
tartar. All right, have dry materials correctly blended. 
What do we put in next, Winona? 
Winona. Molasses and hot water. 
Teacher. Why hot water? 
Pupil. To thin the syrup. 
Teacher. All right. How do you combine the materials to 
make the gingerbread? 
Pupil. You put the molasses and water on the dry materials 
and all gradually so the mixture will not be lumpy. 
Teacher. What else do we put in? The melted fat the last 
thing. After we have everything together, what are we 
going to do? We have to have just the right thickness. 
How thick should the batter be, Opal? 
Opal. Just enough to drop from a spoon. 
Teacher. How are we going to prepare the pans? 
Pupil. First grease the pan, then a little flour. 
Teacher. How full should the pan be? 
Pupil. About one third full. 
Teacher. What is apt to happen if we have the pan too full? 
Pupil. It would take too long to bake, and it might run over 
the pan. 
Teacher. How are we going to tell when the oven is hot 
enough? 
Pupil. We can put a piece of paper in the oven, and if the 
paper is brown it is hot enough. 
Teacher. What kind of oven do we want? 
Pupil. Moderate oven. 
     
-P-A-G-E-107
INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 89 
Teacher. What kind is a moderate oven? 
Pupil. Not too hot and not too cold. 
Teacher. What else are we going to do to the oven? 
Pupil. Put in a pan of water. 
Teacher. All right, let’s not forget that this time. Now you 
two girls are housekeepers, and Winona, you be score- 
keeper. Any more questions? Remember, I am not going 
to answer a single question after the lesson starts. Let’s 
remember to work quietly, and remember about keeping 
the tables neat. [Children go to the tables, and begin to 
get out the utensils for working. ] 
‘Teacher. Girls, how much ginger do you want? [Children 
begin to work quietly. Teacher goes to child and shows 
how to level a teaspoonful of soda.] 
Teacher. Winona, what’s wrong with this measurement? 
[The teacher goes around to different pupils, observing 
their work. Two girls who have been appointed “house- 
keepers” do not cook, but choose two girls to cook for 
them. The one girl who has no uniform does not cook, 
but sits apart from the rest.] 
Teacher [to pupil]. How many teaspoons in a tablespoon? 
Pupil. Two? 
Teacher. Children, tell her. 
Children. Three. 
Teacher. Yes, three. [Teacher goes around among the pupils, 
watching their work carefully. The children are busy 
measuring their ingredients very carefully. The house- 
keepers get the pans ready for baking, light the oven, and 
put a pan of hot water in the oven. The teacher rings the 
bell for attention. ] 
Teacher. All right, girls, where do you want to put the pan 
in the oven? It is about time for you girls to test your 
oven. Girls, some of you have your batter too thin and 
‘ome too thick. What do you suppose is wrong? I think 
some have not been measuring correctly. [The girls go 
to the teacher with their bowls to show their batter. 
Teacher looks at the batter, and tells the girls whether it 
is too thick or too thin.] 
Teacher [to one girl]. Look at the board, and see how much 
water you must take. [The housekeepers test the oven 
with the paper.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  90 VISITING THE TEACHER Av WORK 
Teacher. Girls, how do we put our names on our pans? You 
girls ought to be ready in just a minute. It takes about 
. twenty minutes to bake our cakes. [Teacher rings me bell 
again for attention.] 
Teacher. All right, girls, all come up to the oven, fulesedl 
[Children go to the oven with their cakes to bake.] 
Teacher. On which rack do we want to put our cake first? 
Pupils. On the bottom first, then on the top. 
Teacher. All right then, girls. [Children put their pans in 
the oven. The teacher rings the bell for attention.] 
Teacher. To-day when you put your dishes away, remember 
your towels. Rinse them out in clean water, then put all 
the things back. Now, girls, which dishes do you wash 
first? 
Children. The glasses. [The children get the dish pans and 
begin to wash the dishes. The housekeepers wash the 
recipe off the board. They clean off the supply table and 
wash it.] 
Teacher. Girls, do not forget about washing out that lower 
drawer. [They are very busy cleaning off the tables, 
washing dishes, ete. The housekeepers give the girls Duteh 
Cleanser with which to wash the tops of the tables, The 
teacher tells them to use just a little, and shows them 
how much to use. The teacher goes around the room, in- 
specting the children’s work. The children work very 
quietly. The cakes are baking in the oven. The house- 
keeper rings the bell for attention and assigns tasks such 
as scrubbing the sinks, tubs, ete., to different girls. The 
children serub everything, wash towels, and leave every- 
thing immaculately clean. Teacher again rings the bell. 
She looks at the cakes in the oven.] 
Teacher. All right, girls, get your tables ready for serving. 
The cakes are ready to come out in a few minutes. [The 
teacher goes to the oven and tests the cakes. She rings 
the bell for attention. The children are anxious to see 
how their cakes are coming out.] 
Teacher. All right, girls, how are we going to tell when the 
cakes are cooked enough? Dorothy? 
Dorothy. You take a toothpick and stick it in the cake, and 
if there is dough on it, it is not done. 
Teacher. That is one way. Does any one know another way? 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
INDIVIDUAL_CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 91 
Pupil. You tap the top of the cake, and if it springs back in 
position, it is done. 
Teacher. Who has another way? Now let’s see if it is done. 
[The girls crowd around the oven to see their cakes. The 
teacher takes the little cakes from the oven.] 
Teacher. Please stand back, girls. Now all bring your cakes 
here just a minute. One girl wanted to know what was 
the matter with this cake. What is the matter with it? 
Do you remember before we put it in the pan, how it 
looked? I think this one was too thin. When the cake 
began to rise, there was not enough flour to hold it. [The 
teacher shows the girls another cake.] 
Teacher. Look at this poor little cake. It is burned at the 
sides. That is too bad. Look at this one. The oven was 
a little too hot. We can blame that. Here is one. What 
is wrong with this one? 
Pupil. Too much flour. 
Teacher. Let’s see. Whose cake is this? Do you remember 
when you were stirring this? Why did this one open on 
the top? 
Pupil. It baked a little too rapidly. 
Teacher. All right now. Let’s see, which one do you think 
is best? 
Children [pointing to one cake]. This one. 
Teacher. Now do you think when you make this at home you 
will get it right? 
Children. Yes, ma’am. 
Teacher. All right, let’s get our cakes out quickly. Girls, 
when you want to cut a loaf in half, how do you eut it? 
Pupil. Take a fork. 
Teacher. Why? 
Pupil. So it will not be soggy. 
Teacher. Yes, break it with a fork. [The children set the 
tables for serving. They take their cakes out of the pans 
and eat them. The teacher rings the bell for attention.] 
Teacher. Next time we are going to make banana custard. 
We are going to use eggs and milk. Look up all you can 
about eggs and milk before the next lesson. [The score- 
Keeper reads the scores. The children are given points 
for uniforms: Clean apron, 5; cap, 5; holder, 5; towel, 5.

Supervisor. Children, I want to tell you that I have seen very 
few cooking classes work so quietly. Do you always work 
so well? I think you must. Are you all happy? 
Children. Yes, ma’am. [Classes pass.] 
III. Supervisor’s Instructional Diagnosis 
The work for 6A classes is upon suitable food for growing 
children. The present unit of work was simple desserts suitable 
for luncheon or supper. The preceding lesson was the making 
of hot-water gingerbread. This lesson had not been entirely 
satisfactory and was repeated. The class apparently did not 
require any great amount of added stimulus in order to repeat 
the lesson, but if the teacher had asked some member or members 
of the class to relate the experiences of the last lesson and the 
decision to repeat the lesson, and had then added illustrations or 
word pictures presenting a new situation, the presentation of 
the new lesson might have allowed for more initiative and interest 
on the part of the children. Instead, the teacher opened the . 
lesson with, 
“We are going to repeat the lesson of the last time. We are 
going to make the hot-water gingerbread again.” 
Proper stimulation should have obviated also the many short 
questions in the early part of the recitation. In the assignment 
of the next lesson, the class might have been reminded of the 
unit of work under consideration, and given an opportunity 
to participate in the setting of the next task. The assignment 
should then have become the purpose of the class, rather than 
that of the teacher. 
The educational values of self-control were splendidly ex- 
pressed by the manner in which the children went quietly about 
their work, and by the manner in which the two housekeepers 
and the score-keeper performed their duties. The teacher 
appeared to be entirely outside of the situation and in the back- 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 93 
ground. The only reference made to conduct was, “Let’s remem- 
ber to work quietly and remember about keeping the tables neat.” 
Opportunity for self-appraisal was allowed. Additional train- 
ing in self-appraisal, however, might have been given in the 
following instances: Teacher. “Girls, some of you have your 
batter too thin and some too thick.” “I think this was too thin.” 
“Look at this poor little cake.” 
There was need for more questions of the type that the teacher 
asked just after these, “Which one do you think best?” 
On the whole the lesson was good. Everything was in readi- 
ness for the class, pleasant relations were maintained between 
teacher and pupils throughout the entire lesson, and a uniform 
level of courtesy was maintained. The children appeared happy 
and the teacher was ever ready to assist. Educational values 
were developed and good habits of workmanship were clearly 
shown. 
Iv. The Supervisor’s Interview 
Supervisor [to teacher]. Would you like to talk about the 
lesson, Miss N- 2? Let’s see what we think about the 
lesson, how it may be improved, its weak points and its 
good points. Do you remember the twenty points to be 
observed? [A check list of twenty points was placed in the 
hands of the teacher some time prior to the conference.] 
Preparation of the lesson: When you first started the 
lesson, you told the children you were going to have hot- 
water gingerbread. How would it have been if you had 
asked them what they were going to do to-day? Did they 
know last week what they were going to do to-day? 
Teacher. Yes, they did. 
Supervisor. Do you think it would have been a good idea to 
have had them tell what they were going to do to-day? 
Teacher. Yes. 
Supervisor, Why? 
Teacher. To see if they remembered their last week’s mistakes. 
Supervisor. Ask them why they are repeating last week’s 
lesson to-day. Was it their suggestion or yours that they 
repeat the lesson to-day? 
Teacher. It was my suggestion. They wanted to do it. 
Supervisor. Do you think it would have been a good thing for 
them to review the last week’s lesson? Do you think it 
would have tied this lesson to the last lesson?  
-P-A-G-E-112
94 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. Yes, I think it would. 
Supervisor, What was your purpose in this lesson? 
Teacher. Partly technique. Some can tell that the batter is 
too thick, others too thin. I thought they could have the 
same lesson the second time and have better results. 
Supervisor. Your purpose was that you wanted the children 
to desire better results based upon last week’s experience. 
Do you think the children to-day did have their purpose 
clearly in their minds, or do you think that they merely like 
the gingerbread and wanted to make it again? Do you think 
the purpose was clear in their minds, and do you think the 
purpose was accomplished to-day? 
Teacher. I don’t think it was entirely so. 
Supervisor. Do you think the real result was accomplished 
to-day? Do you think they had a more definite idea that 
right measurements, ete., are necessary to good results? 
Teacher. Yes, I think so. 
Supervisor. I was pleased when you brought them together at 
different times—when they were ready to put the cakes in 
the oven, then again when they were ready to take them 
out of the oven. I thought that was all very fine. I was 
wondering if they have all gone away with the idea clearly 
in mind that good results depend on certain things—good 
measurements, ete.? Do you think they have gone away 
with this idea clearly in their minds? 
Teacher. I am afraid I was a little bit hasty. 
Supervisor. One thing, about self-direction. I think their self- 
direction was very fine. The housekeepers gave out the 
materials, the girl kept the score card, the housekeepers 
directed other members of the class in various duties, Every 
girl seemed to know just what to do. I think their self- 
direction is one of their big points. The main thing is, 
through making gingerbread, these girls learned self-direc- 
tion. Now what about their self-control? I thought their 
self-control was fine. Are they always like that? 
Teacher. I thought you might think there was too much talking. 
Supervisor. No, I thought their talking was just social and 
nice, just enough—their self-control was really very fine. 
Self-appraisal—that was judging the gingerbread. Initia- 
tive—what do you think about the initiative in this lesson? 
Teacher. I think that could be criticized.
-P-A-G-E-113
  INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 95 
Supervisor. In what way? ; 
Teacher. I think that in the first part of the lesson I should 
have given them more opportunity to express themselves. 
I helped them a little more than usual. 
Supervisor. Did you tell them more than you usually do? 
Teacher. Yes, I think I did. 
Supervisor. Do you always tell them the number of the page, 
or do they find it themselves? 
Teacher. Yes, they do, but we have several different books, and 
the number of the page differs. 
Supervisor. Are the questions thought-provoking? What do 
you think about the questions you asked them? 
Teacher. I think perhaps they could have been improved. 
Supervisor. I think you gave them a good many short questions 
that required a short answer. Could you have given them 
questions that required a longer answer—one that would tell 
the whole story? Do you think you might have had one 
girl tell the whole story and see if the others agreed? Do 
you ever do that? 
Teacher. Yes, but I find that they each like to have something 
to say. 
Supervisor. That is all right. That is your technique. You 
may find it is better that way. There are so many ways to 
ask questions. The codperation was very fine among the 
girls. They all seemed to work together so nicely. Now 
about the responsibility. Certainly the housekeepers and 
the score-keepers took their responsibility very seriously. I 
thought those things were very well expressed. How does 
a teacher receive her class? If you were visiting a class 
what would be the very first thing you would look for in the 
teacher? 
Teacher. A pleasant smile, I guess. 
Supervisor. Do you have a definite time for them to put on 
their uniforms? 
Teacher. About five minutes is allowed them for that. 
Supervisor. The attitude of the teacher toward the pupils: I 
like your attitude with the children. You were very courte- 
ous, and I like that very, very much. You all seemed to 
be on the same social level. You gave them the courtesy 
that you expect from them. Are the questions thought- 
provoking? What would you think about that? That is 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
    96 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
difficult. Those questions have to be planned before the 
lesson. Had you done that at all? 
Teacher. I usually make out an outline of one or two questions 
that should be asked, then questions come up from the 
children. 
Supervisor. I was thinking of the first thing to say to the 
class to-day. I think that has a good deal to do with the 
whole lesson. Do you think it would have improved the 
lesson to have used illustrative material? For instance, 
have pictures from magazines of very good gingerbread, 
show it to the children, and say, “Children, what do you 
think of this gingerbread?” That might have added a 
little more interest to the lesson. What do you think of 
that? 
Teacher. I do use that idea as a rule. I have pictures mounted 
of different kinds of food. 
Supervisor. I think sometimes that very fact makes it more 
necessary to stimulate or motivate interest. That is the first 
thing a teacher can do—strengthen the purpose. Have the 
children good habits of workmanship? 
Teacher. Yes, they have. 
Supervisor. Do the children waste time? These children cer- 
tainly were busy every second. Were the practical results 
good? Was the lesson an improvement over last time? 
Teacher. Yes, it was. 
Supervisor. Does the class finish on time? 
Teacher. They did not quite. I do not have to hurry them 
out on Fridays, so that was my own fault. 
Supervisor. I think their self-control was splendid. I never 
visited a class in which they were more orderly or more 
quiet. The teacher is back of that, 
Supervisor. Did the class leave the room with a definite purpose 
for the next lesson? 
Teacher. We are making simple desserts. 
Supervisor. What might you have done in assigning their work 
for next time in giving them a definite purpose for the next 
lesson? 
Teacher. Sometimes we let them make just what they want to 
make. 
Supervisor. Do you think you could have asked them if they 
wanted to make banana custard?
-P-A-G-E-115
  INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 97 
Teacher. Sometimes we plan a group of things to make. We 
do not have time for all the things. 
Supervisor. You could have reminded them that the banana 
custard was one of the desserts they have previously wished. 
to make, and asked them if they wished to make it next 
time. Now please tell me, Miss , what you think of 
the lesson as a whole? 
Teacher. I think there was room for improvement. 
Supervisor. Can you take up any points of the lesson to 
analyze? 
Teacher. I think that I took too much initiative myself. 
Supervisor. Then you would say for one thing to allow more 
initiative? That would be expressed in the beginning of the 
lesson. Is there any other point that you thought of? 
Teacher. I could improve my part by allowing them more 
initiative—allowing them more chances to develop. 
Supervisor. You think probably you might direct your atten- 
tion to that type of teaching? Is there anything else you 
could have done? Would it be necessary to have stimulated 
more at the beginning of the lesson? Would it have made 
the lesson more interesting to the children? 
Teacher. Yes, when I have used pictures before, the children 
have enjoyed it. 
Supervisor. Probably the conclusion should be that the teacher 
should allow more initiative on the part of the children, 
and have more motivation on the part of the teacher. Think, 
“How shall I stimulate interest for the next lesson to allow 
them the greatest amount of initiative in doing this work?” 
You and I are working together for the same thing. You 
must help me and I must help you. 
Teacher. I am certainly glad to have these things suggested. 
One wants to get something new and different. 
Supervisor. Things of very great educational value were all 
expressed very well in your lesson. I am very much 
pleased with your work. I certainly have appreciated your 
codperation. 
Teacher. I certainly appreciate your help.   
V. The Teacher’s Reaction to the Interview 
The children were interested and worked steadily from the

  98 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
At the close of the lesson the supervisor asked my opinion of 
it. Then she led me to make suggestions as to the improvement 
of the lesson. In this way the weak points of the lesson were 
brought to light in a very friendly and helpful manner. The 
supervisor offered suggestions as to how the weak points might 
be strengthened. In my estimation, the encouragement given 
through her constructive criticism was of great value. 
Since the visit of the supervisor I am trying to utilize in my 
class work the suggestions given. I felt, however, had I observed 
the actual performance of how to handle a similar situation in 
an efficient manner, that these suggestions would have been of 
more practical value to me. 
VI. Critical Analysis of the Interview 
Both the diagnosis and the interview indicate a funda- 
mental understanding of teaching methods on the part 
of the supervisor. A highly developed technique of criti- 
cism is of little value when it is used to sell the teacher 
out-of-date methods. Methods to-day are characterized by 
their emphasis upon purposing, self-direction, self-control, 
and self-appraisal. The interview emphasizes throughout 
this point of view. 
From the interview it is quite obvious that a check list 
was used. A copy of this list follows: 
. How does the teacher receive her class? 
. Does the teacher begin work promptly? 
. How long does it take the class to wash hands and put on 
uniforms? | 
. Are materials (necessary for the day’s work) assembled 
and ready to pass out without waste of time? 
. What is the attitude of the teacher toward the pupils and 
of the pupils toward the teacher? 
. Does the lesson show evidences of careful planning? 
. Are the purposes or aims of the lesson clearly stated? 
. Are the questions thought-provoking? 
. What is the relation of the lesson to preceding lessons? 
. What illustrative material did the teacher use? 
. Have the children good habits of workmanship? RPSODOND oO Be ONE be

12. Do the children waste time? 
13. Are the practical results good? 
14. Is the class assembled to judge their results and form 
conclusions? 
15. Does the class finish on time? 
16. Is the class conduct controlled by pupils or teacher? 
17. Does the class leave the room with a definite purpose for 
the next lesson? 
18. What has been done to make the room attractive? 
19. Is the teacher’s personal appearance up to Home Eco- 
nomics standard? 
20. Note anything outstanding about room or in the work 
that you might apply with value to your own room or 
work. 
It is not easy to indicate the proper use of such lists. 
Teachers find them very helpful in their efforts at self- 
improvement. After studying the list a teacher will ask 
frequently for assistance. An excellent method to follow 
where the supervisor and teacher care to review the entire 
list is to discuss the list before the lesson begins. The 
teacher is then unconscious of criticism, and the two dis- 
euss freely the whole range of points to be observed. A 
common shortcoming of criticism is that the teacher is 
bewildered by her many failings. As a general rule, one 
major point is quite enough for one day’s discussion. 
Clearness of purpose or additional opportunities for self- 
direction according to this principle should form the 
subject of a single interview.

1. Kind of school: A new building drawing pupils from three 
schools, open nine weeks. The children are largely foreign: 
U. S. (white) 30 per cent; U. S. (colored) 21 per cent; 
Canadian, English, German, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, 
and Roumanian, 49 per cent. 
2. Teacher: High-school graduate; graduate of state normal 
school; taught in the system since graduation in 1916. Has 
a pleasing personality, very much self-possessed. 
3. Learning conditions: A well-lighted classroom, desks suited 
to most pupils. Each pupil is responsible for his own 
materials, such as books, paper, pens, ete. Twenty-minute 
period each day. 
4, Class activity: A regular day’s lesson in which teacher and 
pupils work together. 
5. Children: There were thirty pupils in the class. Part of the 
pupils were called out for other activities. 
II. Stenographic Report of the Lesson Observed 
Teacher. How many are taking new lessons this morning? 
[Seventeen hands raised.] 
Teacher. How many are repeating their lessons? [Hands 
raised. ] 
Supervisor. Why are you repeating your lessons? 
Pupil. I ean’t get the or in organization. 
Teacher. Roger, why are you repeating yours? 
Roger. I did not get a good g. 
Teacher. What was the trouble with the g? 
Roger. It was not on the line. 
Teacher. What two letters comprise g? What strokes do you 
use for g? : 
Sam. I cannot get g and z good. 
Teacher. What was the trouble? Who else is repeating the 
lesson? [Hands raised.] 
Teacher. What was the trouble? [Teacher and supervisor go 
to different pupils giving assistance on specific problems.] 
Supervisor. Who else is having trouble? Let me know if you 
get it. [This is said to a pupil who has asked for assist- 
ance, and help is given. The pupils continue busily 
working on their lessons while the teacher and supervisor 
go about the room giving assistance. ] 
Supervisor. Boys and girls, I want to show you this boy’s

INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 101 
difficulty. We each have to drive our own writing machine, 
and we each have to work out our own difficulties. This 
boy’s difficulty may help you. [Supervisor goes to the 
board and writes the word organization.] Organization 
is not as good at the end as at the beginning of the word. 
Why? [The pupil’s difficulty is in slant and lateral 
movement. | 
Pupil. The slant is not good. 
Supervisor. Yes. There are two ways of getting around that. 
The way I do is to get the weight off the wrist and write 
the word without stopping. Some folks write part of 
the word, then move the whole arm. The first way is 
generally the best. How many find the last part of your 
word or group of words not as good as the first part? 
[Many hands are raised.] 
Supervisor. How often do you have to move your paper going 
across the line? How many do not move yours at all? 
I ean write half-way across, then I have to move my paper 
with the left hand. Examine your own to see which you 
do. That is what these long words are given for. Ex- 
periment with your writing machine until you can write 
the -entire word with the same slant and write it easily. 
[This is done to emphasize lateral movement.] 
Pupil. I cannot make a B. Cannot make it look right, ; 
Supervisor. Make your B taller than it is wide. [Illustrates 
on the board.] The boy in the back seat, had trouble with 
this letter also. [Teacher and supervisor go to individual 
pupils giving assistance. 
Supervisor. Boys and girls, how many have had this experi- 
ence: you know the kind of letters you want your hand 
to make, but you cannot come anywhere near making that 
kind? [Many pupils raise their hands.] 
Supervisor. You must say, “See here, hand, I do not want 
that kind of work,” and try to control the hand. [This is 
done to emphasize codrdination. The pupils raise théir 
hands for supervisor to look at their papers. ] 
Teacher. How many boys and girls are ready for the test? 
[In order to emphasize the purpose of the tests, the fol- 
lowing is said :] 
Supervisor. How many want to practice a little while longer? 
Remember, you are experimenting with yourselves. You

have seen expert testers trying out automobiles for speed, 
ete. If anything is wrong with the car it is taken back 
to the factory to be fixed up. You people who did not 
pass the lesson yesterday had to come back into the writing 
garage and get fixed up. It may take you two days and 
it may take more. You do not need to take the test until 
you feel sure you can pass it. [Supervisor goes to the 
board.] 
Supervisor. Remember our room is a workshop—sometimes 
to make better spellers, sometimes better writers, and so 
on. This is what has happened. [Draws chart on board 
showing high rate and low quality, and low rate and high 
quality.] This is like a seesaw. Children, do you see 
what I mean? What we want is to have you balance rate 
and quality. Maybe you are high in one, and low in 
another. 
Supervisor. I would like to ask one more question. Where 
is the place to have our best writing? Where is it more 
important? 
Pupil. In all our writing. 
Supervisor. Yes, we do not want to put our writing away in 
a cupboard. We must have our writing good in every 
room in the building, and when we write outside of school 
too. [Pupils practice more on their writing. The teacher 
reports privately to the supervisor that this is the hardest 
of her classes to work with. Some of the pupils take the 
test, and some continue to practice. ] 
Teacher [to those taking the test]. Start. [The pupils write 
for three minutes.] 
Teacher. Time. [The pupils stop writing. Some raise their 
hands and show their papers to the teacher and supervisor. 
The supervisor helps many pupils. The supervisor holds 
up one paper to show to the pupils.] 
Supervisor. What would you score this paper? 
One Pupil. Sixty. 
Supervisor. Let’s look at sixty on the scale. When you are 
not sure of your scoring have five other people score it 
for you. Often, when I write, I ask somebody else to score 
my paper for me. 
Teacher. How many passed their test? [Fifteen.] How 
many did not pass in rate? 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 103 
Sam. I need one more letter. 
Teacher. Sam, you are doing better. 
Teacher. Everyone back in their seats quickly. 
Boy [showing his card]. I used to get all sixties. Now I get 
sixty-five and seventy. 
Supervisor. Boys and girls, you must show your codperation 
with everyone in the building by having good writing 
within school or outside of school. What quality would 
that be? Not less than sixty. Sixty means that you are 
just inside the door. Many will be able to go higher. 
Who remembers the lowest writing he ever had? 
Pupil. Thirty. 
Supervisor. What can you write now? 
Pupil. Sixty-five to sixty. 
Another Pupil. I could not read mine. Now I get seventy-five. 
Supervisor. How long has it taken you? : 
Pupil. Practice. 
Supervisor. Not only practice. Some can practice and it does 
not do any good. It is the kind of practice that counts. 
‘Who else can tell about their lowest scores? 
Pupil. Once I could not read mine. 
Supervisor. Tell how you have improved. It will help some- 
body else. 
Teacher. It is very gratifying to see how these pupils have 
improved in their writing. 
Supervisor. Remember, boys and girls, this is just the work- 
shop to help make you a better writer. 
III. The Supervisor’s Instructional Diagnosis 
Before beginning the lesson the teacher said: “I am pleased 
that you are going to see this class work for I feel that it is the 
one that I have the most difficulty with. They do not seem to 
get along so well and are not so enthusiastic as my other classes 
are.” With this in mind the supervisor took every opportunity 
to stimulate the pupils to have more of a purpose in their 
practice. 
The procedure of the entire lesson both on the part of the 
pupils and the teacher as well was especially well carried out. 
The effect of the maturity of the pupils compared with the 4B 
class previously observed was very noticeable.  
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Special attention was called to codrdination, advantage of 
lateral movement, mechanics of writing, whether improvement 
had been made, means of checking the scoring of their writing, 
and the use to be made of the ability attained. 
The teacher was self-possessed and very sensitive both to the 
needs of the pupils and to the effect of her teaching. She 
asked the supervisor to visit the next class which was excep- 
tionally large and doing such good work. 
IV. The Supervisor’s Interview 
Supervisor. Was there anything about the lesson that you 
wanted to ask me about? 
Teacher. There are a few particular cases. There is one class 
in the afternoon that I would like to talk to you about. 
A. few pupils cannot make the rate and quality after trying 
several times. 
Supervisor. Use your own judgment about that. Watch and 
see if each time they try a lesson they come a little nearer 
the goal. I would not keep them on a lesson more than three 
or four times. Let them go on to another lesson, and come 
back to the lesson they have not passed. Make special 
standards for those. Use your own judgment. There may 
be times when you will have to work with them altogether. 
Experiment. Keep watching the effect of your teaching. 
You can tell when you are not getting things across. 
Teacher. At first I tried board work, but now I feel that indi- 
vidual work helps them more. 
Supervisor. Getting the pupils to reason out things helps them 
more. 
Teacher. Certain mechanics are helpful. 
Supervisor. You have gone a long way in handling individual 
problems, and your group work is good too. 
Teacher. Some children are born writers. [Show example of 
beautiful writing on board.] 
Supervisor. Tell the children we cannot all be good writers, 
but we must do the best we can, and ask them to codperate 
by using their good writing throughout the whole building. 
Teacher. I am pleased to see the various individuals improve 
in their work. 
Supervisor. If you feel encouraged, tell them about it.

INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 105 
V. The Teacher’s Reaction to the Interview 
The two 6B classes of the Duffield School were visited by the 
supervisor of handwriting, Wednesday, April 20. 
The boys and girls will remember the visit, for the supervisor 
worked with the individual pupil instead of remaining in the 
front of the room and observing. 
The children greatly appreciate her suggestions, especially the 
moving of the paper with the left hand while writing long words 
such as organization, judgment, and frequently. 
Another good suggestion received was the comparison of a 
penmanship class with a garage. A new car is tested for speed 
and quality, and a new lesson is tested for rate and quality. 
VI. A Critical Analysis of the Interview 
The most striking characteristic of the supervisory pro- 
cedure here followed is the supervisor’s participation in 
the class discussion. Just what part the supervisor should 
take in the discussion has been an open question. What- 
ever is done should depend upon the particular situation 
at hand—the supervisor, the teacher, and the subject. 
Ordinarily the supervisor will not take part in the class 
discussion unless asked to do so. But the supervision of 
handwriting, organized as it is on the individual basis, 
offers a special problem. The situation gives an oppor- 
tunity for a highly desirable type of supervision in which 
the assistance is direct, objective, and impersonal. Hvery- 
one is thinking about the pupils. The teacher is not con- 
scious of being supervised. She has an opportunity to 
compare her devices with those of the expert. Both are 
absorbed in the improvement of instruction. The lesson 
offers an example of very effective supervisory par- 
ticipation. 
SuMMARY FOR THE SUPERVISOR 
A. Did the supervisor go about the matter of collecting informa- 
tion systematically?

iD: I. By analyzing the recitation into its major elements and 
studying each critically: 
(a) Did the supervisor note evidences of management, 
physical conditions, materials of instruction, and 
discipline? 
(b) Did the supervisor note evidences of the wise 
selection of subject matter? 
(c) Did the supervisor note evidences of the teacher’s 
knowledge of the mental processes involved in 
each of the several types of learning? 
(d) Did the supervisor note evidences of the proper 
teaching procedure? 
(e) Did the supervisor note evidences of technique 
of getting work done? 
(f) Did the supervisor note evidences of acceptable 
standards of attainment? 
II. By studying the teacher systematically : 
(a) Did the supervisor attempt to obtain information 
about the history of the case? 
(b) Did the supervisor attempt to obtain information 
about the teacher’s professional equipment? 
(c) Did the supervisor attempt to obtain information 
about the teacher’s physical equipment? 
(d) Did the supervisor attempt to obtain information 
about the teacher’s personal equipment? 
(e) Did the supervisor attempt to obtain information 
about the teacher’s social equipment? 
III. By studying the pupil. 
. Did the supervisor diagnose the case before applying remedial 
measures? 
I. Does the diagnosis conform to the facts of the case? 
II. Are the remedial measures proposed likely to succeed? 
. Did the supervisor provide a proper setting for the confer- 
ence? Conferences should not, as a rule, take place in the 
presence of the pupils. (For additional points see item 4, 
“Consultation with the Teacher,” at the end of Chapter III.) 
Did the supervisor show skill in eriticism? (For the charac- 
teristics of effective criticism see items on the “Technique of 
Criticism” at the end of Chapter III.) 
E. Was the conference successful as reflected in the improvement 
of teaching?

CHAPTER VI 
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING 
Composite case studies of teaching. In the preceding 
chapters we considered: (1) methods of studying the 
teacher at work; (2) methods of conferring with the 
teacher about her work, and (3) routine matters pertain- 
ing to classroom visitation. The purpose of this and the 
succeeding chapter is to continue, through the study of 
concrete cases, the discussion of supervisory methods of 
analyzing and commenting upon the teaching. The mate- 
rials used are similar to those reproduced in the preced- 
ing chapter, with the exception that the cases cited are 
composite studies rather than individual reports. The 
aim of the discussion is to portray as concretely as pos- 
sible the supervisor in action. 
As stated in the preceding chapters, the supervisor 
must know the teacher as well as teaching—her preju- 
dices, her personal peculiarities, and her emotional traits. 
It is not possible, however, in such case studies as are 
here presented, to take all of these factors into considera- 
tion. To state the situation completely would be an enor- 
mously complicated matter. The actual procedure has 
been to limit the analysis to a study of the teacher at 
work. 
It is difficult to obtain exact information about the 
teacher at work. It is not a difficult task for the 
average supervisor to find out, in a general way, what 
he is to do, but just how he is to do it is an entirely 
different problem. As in many other phases of educational 
109
-P-A-G-E-128
110 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
service, practice is far behind theory. The work of the 
supervisor is to improve teaching. He must carry on his 
work through the instrumentality of the teacher. The 
teacher cannot be helped unless the supervisor working 
with her is sympathetic and capable of analyzing cor- 
rectly the recitation observed. To do this he must see 
the underlying principles of teaching, must be able to 
offer suggestions applicable to the particular case, and 
must not deceive himself or the teacher by commenting 
on the lesson in high-sounding, pedagogical terms. Neither 
must he be led astray by trade devices. He must have 
““super-vision.’? He must see each recitation as a cross 
section of the particular teacher’s skill, and he must 
regard it as the physician regards his X-ray plate: a 
basis for active remedial treatment, if necessary, and for 
generous commendation, if deserved. 
In most recitations, as has been already stated, there 
are one or two outstanding features to which the atten- 
tion of the teacher should be directed. The great merit 
of. the third-grade recitation in reading reported on the 
pages following is undoubtedly its recognition of the dif- 
fering needs of two groups. The teacher knew, appar- 
ently, to what weaknesses the attention of the small 
group should be directed. She had not, however, devel- 
oped a technique that would enable her to keep two 
groups productively employed at the same time. She 
failed to provide for the small group practice exercises 
that were stimulating and interesting, as well as effective. 
These two points, that is, the recognition of individual 
needs, and provision of suitable group work, may well 
engage the attention of supervisor and teacher for some 
time. Through skillful questions and suggestions by the 
supervisor, the teacher should be led to formulate a 
statement of worthwhile results to accrue from this type 
of reading. She should then be led to convert these de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES seiblet 
sired results into clearly defined aims or purposes, one 
or more for each group. With the desired results well 
in mind and aims clearly stated, the teacher and super- 
visor should search for materials and tools through which 
these aims are to be realized, This involves finding for 
the one group interesting reading materials with the 
vocabulary difficulties which are to be remedied, and dis- 
covering productive reading exercises to engage the 
attention of the other group. It means also a discussion 
of effective types of drills, advisability of working out 
questions and study suggestions, and organization of the 
suggestions for blackboard or flash card use. The teacher 
should be led to see the necessity of knowing and taking 
into account the interests and experiences of children of 
that particular age group. Finally, she should be directed 
in the development of suitable exercises with which to 
determine the degree of success she has attained in accom- 
plishing desired results. Such definite, clear-cut, practical 
suggestions are the only ones that justify the overhead 
now being incurred through ‘‘supervision.’’ Unless the 
supervisor can do this type of diagnosis, and supply 
remedial measures that can be carried out, the time and 
effort of both teacher and supervisor are wasted.

How the case in reading was analyzed. In order to 
determine how supervisors would treat this lesson unit in 
reading, it was submitted to a number of persons inter- 
ested in elementary-school supervision. Some of these 
persons were field supervisors in a state department of 
public instruction. There were also in the group super- 
vising teachers, city grade supervisors, and graduate stu- 
dents of university classes in elementary supervision. 
Each supervisor was asked to assume that he had 
observed the lesson described, check it on the points indi-

cated in the score sheet, reproduced on page 117, using 
such descriptive words as necessary to give a brief evalu- 
ation of the procedures, and formulate what he would 
say to the teacher in assisting her to improvement. For 
the most part, the several supervisors attacked this task 
seriously, and the results should be typical of the kind 
of classroom supervision that teachers receive. 
1. Kind of school: City school in a community above the aver- 
age in culture. 
2. Teacher: High-school graduate who has taken county exam- 
inations, attended institutes, and attended one university 
summer session. She has no other professional training 
except that gained by several years’ experience of a varied 
nature and through professional reading. She is energetic 
and has a fair insight into modern standards of teaching. 
She would be considered an exceptionally stimulating teacher 
from many viewpoints. 
3. Learning conditions: ‘The morning session of a typical grade 
room. The room was comfortably heated and lighted. 
There was a slate blackboard with writing upon it, well 
placed and easily seen. Seats were non-adjustable, but well 
suited to children. The discipline was natural, codperative, 
and generally favorable to learning. 
4. Class activity: A review lesson in reading taught for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether the majority of class had 
mastered the selection, and to give needed individual help 
to a group of pupils who had been absent when the lesson 
was studied earlier in the year. 
5. Children: No one was below normal. About 25 per cent were 
somewhat above normal. There were thirty-five pupils in all, 
of whom the following were to receive special help: 
Roderick 
Robert 
Catherine 
George .. 
/ Willard 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: About two months 
previous to the lesson the children had read this selection t

orally, having had the usual phrase preparation. They were 
now about to complete the work of the 3B Grade, and had 
read both orally and silently several other third readers. 
No recent directed work had been done on the selection for 
the day. However, the books were in the children’s desks. 
7. Materials used: New Elson Brady, Book III, pages 18 to 20 
(Scott, Foresman & Co.). 
Wuy THE Razsir’s Tar, Is SHort 
Once upon a time the rabbit had a long tail, but now it is short. 
‘And this is how the change came about. 
A young rabbit one day sat on the edge of a swamp, looking at 
the juicy green plants on the other side. They were the only things 
to eat that he could see. So he wanted to go across the swamp, but 
he could not swim. 
Just then a lazy old alligator poked his nose above the water. 
“*T might ask him to take me across,’’ said the rabbit to himself. 
“<But I am afraid that he is too proud to carry me, because he can 
walk and swim, too. Perhaps I can get across the swamp by playing 
a trick upon him. I will try it.’’ 
“€You look warm, Friend Rabbit,’’ said the alligator. ‘‘Why don’t 
you come into the water? It is cool here.’’ Now the alligator knew 
very well that the rabbit could not swim. 
“IT am not warm at all,’’ said the rabbit, ‘‘but I am a little 
hungry. You see, there are a great many rabbits in the world. There 
are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them. So, of course, it 
takes a great many green leaves to feed us. Oh, yes, Friend Alli- 
gator, we are a very large and important family! There are many 
more rabbits than alligators.’?” 
‘‘How foolish you are!’’ cried the alligator, angrily. ‘‘ Why, 
there are thousands and thousands and thousands of alligators in the 
world! There are more than a hundred alligators ip this swamp! 
Can you find a hundred rabbits in the woods?’’ 
““Certainly I can!’’ said the rabbit. ‘‘I’ll count the alligators, 
and then you may count the rabbits. Call the alligators together. 
Make a line of them across the swamp so that I can hop out upon 
their backs and count them.’’ 
So the alligator called and called. Up from the swamp came the 
alligators, big ones, and middle-sized ones, and little ones. The old 
alligator made them into a line right across the swamp, just like a 
bridge. 
“‘Now count them, Friend Rabbit,’’ he said. ‘‘If there are not 
more than a hundred alligators here, you may eat me!’’ 
The rabbit hopped upon the alligator bridge. As he went from 
one to another, he counted them, ‘‘One, two, three, four, five, six,
-P-A-G-E-132
114 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
seven,’’ and so on up to a hundred. Yes! there were a hundred, even 
more than a hundred. 
But by the time he had counted the last alligator, of course the 
sly rabbit was on the other side of the swamp. 
“‘T'll call the rabbits together some other day, when I am not so 
hungry,’’ he called back to the old alligator. ‘‘Good-bye! Who is 
foolish now?’’ he said with a laugh. 
But the rabbit laughed too soon. For one of the alligators caught 
the end of the rabbit’s tail in his great jaws, and bit it off. 
And since that time, rabbits’ tails have always been short. 
The following phrases were written on the blackboard:

8. The lesson: The children looked up passively as the teacher 
stepped before them. They did not “sit up in order,” but sat 
informally as they might were there no teacher in the room. 
They were orderly but not particularly eager in their atti- 
tude. To meet this situation the teacher said, “Everyone 
may stand.” [Prompt response.] “Up on your toes.” 
[Satisfactory response.] “Stretch.” [Response.] “Be 
seated.” [Children sat up in good position ready for work.] 
Teacher. Now, boys and girls, you may take your readers and 
open to page 18. [Prompt response, readers open at 
once.] I would like to have everyone read this through 
as rapidly as you can. Roderick, Robert, Catherine, 
George, and Willard may come up here to the board with 
me, please. Bring your books. [Children pass to the 
board, and others begin work in a businesslike way.] 
Study these phrases, please [pointing to the first one]. 
Are there any words that you do not know? [Robert 
points to alligator in the second phrase. The teacher 
divides it into syllables by vertical lines, and with her 
hand covers all but the first syllable. She asks Robert to 
pronounce al. The usual process of helping a child to 
unlock a word is followed successfully, and Robert soon 
pronounces alligator.] What is an alligator?  
-P-A-G-E-133
  
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 115 
Roderick. It is a long flat thing with a tail that lives in the 
water [illustrated with gestures]. 
Teacher. Do you see them around here? 
Catherine. No, only in the park. 
Teacher. Read the next phrase. [The children need help in 
unlocking five words in the entire phrase drill. They are 
in each case required to codperate in pronouncing separate 
syllables and putting them together to form the word. 
All of the children work practically all of the time. The 
phrases are read as wholes as soon as the individual words 
are mastered. A few phrases that have given trouble are 
read twice. This exercise required eight minutes, and 
these children were then asked to go in a group to seats in 
the back of the room. The teacher then gave them the 
following directions :] 
Now, look at the first paragraph. See who can read it 
well. [She now turns to the children who have been 
reading silently, and who have in several cases finished 
the work and have been unoccupied for at least three 
minutes. ] 
Now, you children may take the notebook we used this 
morning, and I want you to write three good questions. 
Maybe I'll let you ask your questions by and by. Be sure 
to use the page next to. the one we wrote on yesterday. 
[Teacher then goes to back of room where the special 
group is seated.] What is the name of your story? 
[Class responds.] Who is ready to read? Robert. 
[Robert reads, but hesitates on juicy.] Look at it again. 
I am sure you know it. [Robert succeeds. After he 
has finished his reading, he remains standing while the 
teacher asks him questions on what he has read.] What 
did the rabbit do? 
Robert. He sat by a swamp. 
Teacher. What did he want to do? 
Robert. He wanted to cross the swamp but could not swim. 
Teacher. Did he cross the swamp? [Roderick volunteers to 
read, but hesitates on several words and receives help.] 
Tell us that again. [Roderick reads with fair success the 
third paragraph of the story.] Now you may all read to 
yourselves and finish the story. [The teacher now walks 
up and down the aisles, and inspects without comment
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
the questions written by the other children. She returns 
to the group.] Who is ready to read the paragraph he 
+ likes the best? [George reads the paragraph beginning, 
“How foolish you are!” and finishes the page. Catherine 
reads the material on page 20.] George, why did you 
read more than Catherine did? 
George. Because I liked the whole thing. 
Teacher. Children, put your work aside for recess. 
9. Comments: The entire lesson occupied twenty minutes. The 
teacher planned to correct the notebooks and thus obtain a 
check on the work the children had done at their seats, 
several of whom had finished long before the group exercise 
was completed. She stated that the final work on the selec- 
tion would be the reading of favorite paragraphs by all of 
the class for establishing standards in oral reading. She 
did not plan to make further reference to the questions 
prepared by the children, several of whom had been clever 
enough to turn to the back of the book and copy the ques- 
tions there provided instead of making up their own 
questions, as the teacher suggested. 
The evaluation sheet which is reproduced on the opposite 
page was used in analyzing the lesson. 
The material submitted by these supervisors was care- 
fully studied and classified as far as possible, with the 
following results: 
A. Analysis of Recitation 
I. Physical conditions for learning. There was una- 
nimity of opinion with regard to the physical conditions 
for learning. All agreed that the light, temperature, seat- 
ing, and working tools were satisfactory, and that the 
pupils were normal or superior. 
II. Immediate conditions for learning. The material 
was classified as a ‘‘study recitation,’’ or as material pre- 
viously studied in which the purpose was testing for 
mastery, practice, or drill. Two persons judged this to 
be a project lesson. One said that it was new material

for five of the pupils, but old material for the rest. Sev- 
eral classified it as a study recitation for five of the 
pupils, and drill material for the rest. The majority of 
those evaluating the material attempted to classify it by 
using such symbols as poor, fair, good. Relatively few 
checked the type of material presented. 
B. Evaluation of Procedure 
In evaluating the methods used by the teacher, three 
said they were poor; three, fair; two, good. Twenty-six 
stated that the system of distinguishing between groups 
was good, but the procedure in handling the groups was 
poor. One stated that it was good as far as it went. 
Another used the term ‘‘dictatorial’’ in describing the 
method. Still another said, ‘‘No method is used except 
in pronunciation.’’ 
Under ‘‘Accuracy and manipulation of tools’? four 
indicated ‘‘none’’; thirteen said ‘‘poor’’; five, ‘‘fair’’; 
seven, ‘‘good.’’ 
Under ‘‘Organization of material’’ four said that no 
organization was evident; sixteen stated that the organi- 
zation was poor; six called it ‘‘fair’’; two, ‘‘good’’; 
and fifteen, though commending the selection of difficult 
phrases, said that this was inadequate. 
The ‘‘Motivation’’ was scored by all the supervisors. 
Twenty-six described the motivation as ‘‘of the lowest 
type,’’ ‘‘for love or fear of the teacher,’’ ‘‘inferior,’’ or 
“‘lacking.’? Twelve called it ‘‘poor,’? but one person 
believed it to be satisfactory. 
The quality of English used by the teacher was con- 
sidered ‘‘fair’’ by most of the supervisors, whereas that 
used by the pupils was rated as good for their age and 
grade. 
“Interest shown by the pupils’’ was rated from ‘‘lack- 
ing’’ to ‘“‘good.’’ The most common expression was that 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 119 
interest was at a ‘‘low ebb’’ or ‘‘passive.’’ Thirty people 
stated that the initiative of the pupils was ‘‘misdirected’’ 
because they ‘‘copied’’ or ‘‘looked in the book for the 
questions.’’ The opinion was almost unanimous that no 
evidence was given of the organization of material, and 
that the assignment was ‘‘lacking,’’ ‘‘undetermined,”’ 
“not checked up.’’ 
C. Summary of Evaluation of Procedure 
There was, in general, a lack of well-defined purpose ~ 
or aim. That which appeared was vague, not clearly 
thought out, realized in part with the weak group, but not 
at all with the large group. The pupils were given an 
opportunity to cheat, the tools were inexpertly used, and 
no use was made of points gained. 
The teacher had not planned her work carefully, which 
was evidenced by her inexpert questioning. 
The lack of proper organization was pointed out as an 
outstanding weakness of the recitation. ‘‘Too much time 
was devoted to the small groups,’’ and ‘‘the majority of 
the class was left to solve its problems unaided.’’? Time 
was wasted because the teacher had no way of checking 
the work accomplished. 
Many of the supervisors commented on the lack of 
interest shown by the class, due in large part, as they 
thought, to the fact that the material was already known 
to the pupils and had been mastered. The outcome was 
not worth while, and there was a lack of motivation, 
except that aroused either ‘by love or fear of the teacher. 
No opportunity was provided for an evaluation of the 
subject matter. 
Bad habits of study were developed in the larger group 
in that there was no specific training in correct habits 
of work. The children learned to cheat and to simulate 
obedience outwardly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  120 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Little or no initiative was shown by the pupils except 
that, without direction, they made use of the questions 
in the back of the book. Such initiative as was in evi- 
dence was entirely misdirected. 
In commenting upon the review exercises, the super- 
visors commended the teacher for recognizing the need 
for word-study, and for varying the review to meet the 
needs of the two groups. It was the consensus of those 
evaluating the lesson that the phrase drill was not effective. 
The group did not master the phrases, and pupils of 
superior ability were not provided for. 
Among miscellaneous comments are the following: 
. Directions did not stimulate reflective thought. 
. She is after subject matter, not power or skill. 
. Children did not know what the goal was, 
. Teacher placed all emphasis on primary learning. 
. No place for evaluation of subject matter. 
. No insight into mental situations. 
. Need of physical exercise indicates that there was no antici- 
pation and pleasurable expectancy.

Suggestions Made by Supervisors to the Teacher 
Each supervisor who evaluated the recitation was asked 
to indicate the suggestions that he, as a supervisor, would 
make to the teacher. About one hundred different sug- 
gestions have been listed and classified. 
The first group of suggestions relates to the phases of 
the work that are to be commended. It includes such 
statements as the following: 
1. The division of the class into groups was good. 
2. The teacher showed an understanding of children’s nature 
by not hurrying them. 
3. Skillful work with the small group. 
4. Skill in finding out what phrases pupils did not know. 
5. Short physical training exercise good. 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 121 
6. Attempts towards effectively reviewing lesson good. 
7. Method of securing motivated reading with small group was 
sound. 
The weak points to which the attention of the teacher 
should be called center around the work of the larger 
group. 
1. Large group was unoccupied during the phrase drill. 
2. No challenge was presented to the large group since ques- 
tions were in the back of the book. 
3. A few of the large group cheated. 
4, No relation between assignment of the large group and the 
, aim. 
5. The children did not believe that the questions to be an- 
swered were of much importance. 
. No testing of the large group. 
. The large group did not enjoy the work. 
. The assignment was indefinite. OND 
The actual remedial suggestions that these supervisors 
would offer to the teacher are presented below. They 
cover a variety of topics, many of which do not permit 
classification. 
1. The Assignment 
(a) Give motivated assignments. 
(b) Make assignments of varying difficulty to the groups. 
(c) The assignment should be in the form of specific direc- 
tions or questions placed upon the blackboard. 
(d) Can you think of a better assignment? 
2. The Teacher’s Planning of Work 
(a) Plan class work and seat work carefully before com- 
ing to school. 
(b) Plan for developing the child’s initiative. 
(c) Develop plan of having pupils give to a paragraph 
one question which may be answered by one sentence, 
these sentences to be used as an outline of the story. 
(d) The teacher should plan her work in advance with 
definite goals previously set to be achieved.   
 
-P-A-G-E-140

supervisor. ) 
(f) How far ahead is the work planned? 
3. The Materials 
(a) More interesting material should have been used. 
(6) A new selection should have been used. 
4. Principles of Good Teaching that Should Be Evident

have a full quota of work. 
(b) Every lesson should contain one or two opportunities 
for the superior pupils. 
(c) Pupils should be taught some way of evaluating their 
own accomplishments. 
(d) Require only such work as you have time to examine, 
criticize, approve.

should include all pupils. 
(f) Children should be permitted to engage freely in the 
discussion of the lesson. 
(g) Definite standards of accomplishment should be set 
up. 
(h) Teacher should show the pupils her appreciation of 
their effort. 
5. Devices and Tools Suggested by Supervisors 
(a) Use pictures to explain such words as alligator. 
(b) Use the brighter pupils to help the slower. 
6. Illustrative Questions and Suggestions on the Teaching of 
the Lesson 
(a) Write a story like this one about a monkey and an 
elephant after reading this story once. 
(b) How many of the plants that rabbits like to eat did 
he see on the other side of the swamp? 
(c) There are several word pictures in this story. Find 
two. Draw them as the words make you see them. 
(d) Write a question which you think is based upon the 
most interesting part of the story. At the close of 
the recitation we shall select the best. 
(e) Have pupils choose favorite paragraph, and give rea- 
sons for choice.  
-P-A-G-E-141
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 123 
(f) Summarize the story by rapid drill. 
(g) Have groups work out plans for dramatizing story. 
(h) Questions should be read and answered in class.

form of review. 
(j) Have pupils find phrases in book by scanning to 
increase speed. 
(%) Make lists of words and phrases that tell “time,” 
“size,” “feeling,” ete.

(e) Was the plan well organized? 
(f) What was pupil’s method of getting questions? 
(g) How many of the class were stronger in any way when 
the lesson was completed than when it began? 
{h) What is your opinion about devoting a class period 
to a few, while the faithful attendants were merely 
being kept busy? 
(i) What good habits were you encouraging in the large 
part of your class? 
(j) What power was gained by their assigned work? 
(k) How was the smaller division better for the assign- 
ment?
-P-A-G-E-142
124 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
10. Miscellaneous Suggestions 
(a) Visit a demonstration school. Observe and compare. 
(b) Write a report of this lesson, analyzing its excellencies 
and defects, and defending your procedure. 
(c) Take a year’s vacation and go to school. 
(d) Make your lessons correlate with the child’s activities 
and life. 
General conclusion. In attempting to analyze this situ- 
ation, the great variety of suggestions made by the super- 
visors who participated again evidences the fact, stated 
elsewhere, that our supervisory theories are far in advance 
of our practices. It also reveals the need for use by our 
supervisors of definite criteria for judging teaching skill, 
in order that there may be more unity of judgment regard- 
ing remedial measures. The lesson following is also illus- 
trative of the need for more analytical study of the 
recitation by supervisors. 
AN ORAL AND SrtentT Reapine Lesson, Grape 2A. 
1. Kind of school: City school in residential section. 
2. Teacher: A high school and normal school graduate with five 
years of teaching experience in primary grades. She was a 
happy, orderly, stimulating teacher, a good organizer, able 
to control children easily, and created good working con- 
ditions without conspicuous effort; a woman of refinement. 
8. Learning conditions: A comfortable room during the middle 
morning period. The seats were uniform in size but com- 
fortable for the pupils. The heating and lighting conditions 
were satisfactory. The general tone of the room was con- 
ducive to industry and high standards of accomplishment. 
Stimulating assignments were on the blackboard. One sec- 
tion of the class was busily employed at their seats illus- 
trating a story which they were to read in class. 
4, Class activity: A combined silent and oral reading lesson. 
It was the only reading work done except sight oral reading 
in another class period. There were twenty-three pupils in 
the section. Those who were not called to recite in the
-P-A-G-E-143
  
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 125 
morning, the teacher planned to call on for sight reading 
in the afternoon. 
5. Children: The children were not sectioned for ability, but 
the entire group of forty pupils was regarded by the teacher 
as normal or a little above normal. No pupils were felt 
by her to be in need of special help, though she attempted 
to give some extra help to superior children. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: This class had spent 
eight months in studying second readers except for a short 
period early in the year when two first readers were read. 
About eight books had been completed either as sight read- 
ing or in the manner indicated by the lesson to follow. 
Daily lessons of fifteen minutes each had been conducted in 
phonies and phrases preparing for silent and oral reading 
of the type to be presented. Following this exercise the 
children were given seat work, other than a study of the 
lesson to be read. The class work was entirely advance 
study. 
7. Materials used: BincHam, Stories of Mother Goose Village 
(Rand McNally), pages 119 to 125 and page 191. 
Pre’s Trip To THE SKY 
Little Peg was the miller’s daughter. She was a cripple, you know, 
and had only one leg. But she was happy for all that. ‘‘ Because, 
even if I have not two legs,’’ said Little Peg, ‘‘I have two eyes, 
two ears, and two hands. That is much to be thankful for.’’ 
Late one summer day she was lying on the grass looking at her 
picture book. Not a truly true picture book like yours and mine,— 
oh, no,—but one much more beautiful. 
Peg’s picture book was the clouds; it had no end to it like yours 
and mine, but it was full of new pictures and new stories every day. 
Such a beautiful, wonderful, wonderful book! 
Sometimes she would see a picture that looked like the king’s 
palace, with great marble pillars and arches and steps. Sometimes 
she would see lions and tigers and elephants, or graceful white swans 
swimming on lakes of blue. Often she would try to look at King Sun 
himself as he smiled warmly upon her. 
Sometimes there would be woolly sheep, and wee, fluffy lambs; 
and again, galloping gray ponies or stately ships with golden masts 
and puffy, silver sails. 
Then there would sometimes be cloud ladies; and children—boys 
and girls with merry, laughing faces. They seemed always beckoning 
to Little Peg to come and play with them in cloudland.
-P-A-G-E-144
126 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
‘¢Oh, if I only could! ’’ she said, and then,—guess what? She fell 
asleep in the grass. 
While she lay there sleeping the Old Woman who swept cobwebs 
from the sky passed by. 
“‘Deary me,’’ she said, ‘‘the day has been too long for Little Peg. 
I believe I will take her to ride with me while I brush the cobwebs 
from the sky.’’ 
So she tucked her down into the basket, with only the top of her 
eurly head peeping out; then up, up, up, she sailed,—straight to 
eloudland. 
Peg could hardly believe it when she opened her eyes and found 
herself among the clouds. 
The Old Woman smiled and said, ‘‘How do you like it, my dear?’’ 
“‘Very, very much,’’ replied Little Peg. ‘‘How did you know I 
wanted to come?’’ 
‘¢Perhaps a bird or a fairy told me. We are passing through 
fairyland now, so listen, and I will tell you where they all live.’’ 
‘«That beautiful palace over there belongs to my lady, the moon. 
She is the queen of the heavens, and the sun is king. With them 
dwell all the light fairies of both day and night. They are a busy 
set, I can tell you,—these moonbeams and sunbeams which carry 
light to the earth. The large, gray palace with fluted columns is the 
home of the water fairies, another busy set. There dwell the snow- 
flakes, the rain, the mist, and the dew. 
‘¢They always dress in white or gray 
And keep the flowers fresh and gay; 
They wash the faces of trees and grass 
And throw a kiss to all they pass. 
**Sometimes they join their hands in a row 
And down to the earth with sunbeams go, 
They form a rainbow gay and bright 
And dance and sing with glad delight.’’ 
“*Yes, yes,’’ said Little Peg, ‘‘I have seen’ these fairies many 
times, though I did not know they lived in such a beautiful home. 
The stars, too, I have learned to love, watching them play hide-and- 
seek with the clouds. I have seen them march and form pretty 
figures like the Great Bear, Jacob’s Ladder, and the Sparkling 
Dipper. And best of all, I have seen them run a race,—pellmell down 
the Milky-Way Stream.’’ 
“*Yes, indeed,’’ laughed the Old Woman, ‘‘the star fairies are a 
merry troop. They are the Moon’s children, you know, and she has 
named them all, though, dear me, I cannot see how she ever keeps up 
with them. Why, she is even worse than the Old Woman Who Lives 
in the Shoe.’’

“‘But come, I have finished my sweeping, and Mother Goose will 
wonder what has become of me. Shut your eyes and count five, then 
open wide and you will find yourself.in the grass where I found you.’? 
And so she did. 
**Peg, Peg, with a wooden leg— 
Her father was a miller: 
He tossed a dumpling at her head, 
And said he would not kill her.’’ 
8. The lesson: The children have just finished the seat work 
which followed the phonies class, and the teacher has 
checked this by passing up and down the aisles. As she 
reaches the front of the room she begins. 
Teacher. A class, are you ready with Mother Goose Village? 
We are going to use the little chairs to-day. Class stand. 
[Children stand promptly; the teacher nods and they skip 
lightly to chairs placed a comfortable distance apart in 
two rows in the front of the room.] All right. [The 
children sit quietly, and look up into the teacher’s face 
confident that something interesting is going to happen.] 
What is our story about to-day? 
John. Peg’s Trip to the Sky. 
Teacher. Yes; and now we are going to turn to page 191 and 
find the little verse that tells about Peg. Who can find 
it first? [Children open quickly to the right place and 
work diligently. One hand is raised in a moment.] You 
found it first, Henry. The one who reads this funny little 
verse through first to himself may read it to me. What 
did her father toss at her head? [Henry finishes first.] 
Henry, you read. 
Henry. “Peg, Peg, with a wooden leg— 
Her father was a miller; 
He tossed a dumpling at her head, 
And said he would not kill her.” 
Teacher. Is not this a funny little verse? [Children and 
teacher both laugh with genuine enjoyment.] Now turn 
back to the story of Little Peg on page 110. We'll read 
this story to ourselves first. What was the matter with 
Little Peg? [Children work very energetically.] _Who- 
ever finds out first, don’t tell! [Teacher enters into the

128 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
spirit of the children’s problem in a whole-hearted way 
which enlists their entire codperation.] 
Dorothy. [Several hands have been raised and teacher finally 
nods to this child.] She was a cripple. 
Teacher. How do you know she was crippled? 
Dorothy. Because she had only one leg. 
Teacher. She was thankful for something. The one who 
finds out first, look at me. [Children look for less than 
a half minute when a dozen sit up and look at the 
teacher.] You may tell me, Charles. 
Charles. She was thankful for two eyes and two ears. 
Teacher. And something else. 
Marion, And hands. 
Teacher. Yes, that is much to be thankful for, too. Now who 
was Little Peg, Alice? [Alice reads first paragraph 
orally.] What kind of a picture book did Peg have? 
Read the next paragraph to yourselves. What was she 
doing one summer day? Where was she? The one who 
reads it over first can read it to me. [Class works rapidly,

the second and third paragraphs orally.] 
Teacher. Tell me what Peg’s picture book was? [Children 
look in books at once, and in an instant hands are raised.] 
Charles. It was clouds. 
Teacher. Did you ever see pictures in the clouds: you can 
see mountains, rivers, bridges, houses, and castles. [Chil- 
dren acquiesce with pleasure and enthusiasm.] Tell me 
in your own words just what kind of a book it was, 
Ruth. 
Ruth. She could see everything. 
Teacher. Read and tell me all about it. [Ruth reads the third 
and fourth paragraphs in a pleasing manner.] Now what 
did Peg see, Donald? 
Donald. Sometimes she could see lions, tigers, and elephants. 
Teacher. I am going to look the next time and see if I can 
see all those things. She saw something else? 
George [volunteering]. She saw the sun. 
Teacher. Let us read the last paragraph on page 120 to our- 
selves, and see what else she saw. [Children read rapidly 
and with good understanding. Barbara volunteers. ]

Teacher. Next page. Sometimes she could see something else. 
What was it? [Children read first paragraph on page 121

you know they were happy boys and girls? 
John. It says they had merry, laughing faces. 
Teacher. Now I am going to ask someone to read this hard 
page for you. Begin, “Sometimes she would see a pic- 
ture,” on page 120. [Child reads with very good under- 
standing as far as first paragraph on page 121.] After 
recess we will finish the story at our seats. 
9. Comments: This lesson occupied just twenty minutes. The 
class stood and passed to seats in good order without direc- 
tion from the teacher, and were dismissed for recess. On 
the blackboard were placed the following directions: 
Read the story of Peg clear through. 
Go back to page 124—copy the verses. 
Write a list of the things in Peg’s picture book. 
Draw cloudland, stars, moon, sun, and Peg’s basket. 
As soon as the children came in from recess they began 
work at once on unlined sheets of paper which had been 
placed on their desks by a pupil who had been chosen to 
do this. The results of the 30 minutes of work were very 
satisfactory. No pupil failed to show average technique 
and better than average understanding. 
A. Analysis of the Recitation 
I. Physical conditions for learning. Among the super- 
visors who reported upon the lesson it was manifestly 
difficult to find much difference of opinion concerning the 
physical conditions for learning. All of the supervisors 
considered the physical conditions satisfactory. 
There was some variation in the rating of pupils. They 
were called normal, superior, good, interested, and active.
-P-A-G-E-148
  130 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
One supervisor suggested that they should have been 
more carefully graded, as the forty pupils were not of 
equal ability. 
II. The immediate conditions for learning. The mate- 
rials used in the recitation were classified as new, and 
the method as the study-recitation type. Two observers 
thought that drill work was indicated because of ‘‘some 
oral reading motivated to a degree.’? Other comments 
were: ‘‘Real study is provided in which every child takes 
part’’; ‘‘A conventional study recitation, but evidently 
stimulating’; ‘‘The problem presented is the apprecia- 
tion of Peg’’; ‘‘A purposeful study recitation with a 
good problem to be solved, a good project, good questions 
to be answered, good foundation for mastery, evidence 
of excellent drill.’’ Several supervisors classified the 
material as both new and old, in spite of the statement 
that the work was entirely advance study for the 
elass, and that the seat work was given on other ma- 
terials. 
B. Evaluation of Procedure 
The method used by the teacher was classified as good, 
very good, excellent, superior. Such comments as, ‘‘Moti- 
vated questions for rapid reading,’’ ‘‘Interesting story to 
arouse interest enough to want more,’’ ‘‘The teacher is 
the center of the scheme,’’ were made. 
The accuracy of manipulation of tools was considered 
*‘skilled,’’ ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘very good,’’ ‘‘excellent,’’ ‘‘smooth 
work of its type,’’ ‘‘showing wise choice.’’ 
The organization of material was rated as ‘‘fair,’’ 
**good,’’ ‘‘very good,’’ ‘‘well organized.’’ 
Motivation was considered ‘‘satisfactory,’’ ‘‘good,’’ 
“‘very good,’’ ‘‘excellent,’’ ‘‘for study at seats fairly well 
provided.’’ 
The fertility of suggestion was ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘very good,’’
-P-A-G-E-149
    COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 131 
*‘excellent,’’ and ‘‘supplemented thought by saying what 
she would do.’’ 
The interest of the pupils was regarded variously as 
“good,?’ ‘‘keen,’’ ‘‘excellent,’’ although one person quali- 
fied his rating by stating, ‘‘ Animation was displayed and 
pupils doubtless interested.’’ 
Quite a difference of opinion was shown in the judg- 
ments of initiative shown by pupils. One ‘‘evaluator’’ 
said that there was no evidence of initiative. Others 
rated the initiative as ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘very good,”’ ‘‘excellent.’” 
Other comments were: ‘‘Initiative shown in speed in 
reading,’ ‘‘Perhaps in their drawing,’’ ‘‘Pupils volun- 
teered readily.’’ 
The organization of material by pupils was considered 
‘*fair,’’ ‘“‘good,’’ ‘‘very good,’’ ‘‘excellent.’’ One person 
stated that no opportunity was offered for organizing 
materials except in drawing. 
The assignment was judged to be well mastered. One 
person qualified this statement by adding, ‘‘from the 
teacher’s point of view.’’ 
The English of both pupils and teacher was considered 
good. 
C. Summary of Evaluation of Recitation 
One supervisor summarized his evaluation of the reci- 
tation as follows: 
This lesson is typical of the combined oral and silent reading 
that teachers are trained to conduct. It seemed to satisfy both 
teacher and pupils. It was faulty in that it kept inside of the 
book. The teacher failed to make Peg a real child by tying the 
story up with the pupils’ interests and experiences. She failed 
to grasp the real value of the selection to the class. It was 
acceptable in the drill phases of silent reading, inasmuch as it 
developed speed through answering definite questions. The 
material was worthy of different treatment, and the class was 
ready to do better thinking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  132 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Other summaries were of a commendatory type. The 
majority believed that the teacher had a definite purpose 
and that this purpose was realized; that the children 
expected an interesting lesson; and that they worked 
industriously with a specific aim. The individual work 
of the class was good. The assignment of seat work was 
well planned, definite, pleasant, thorough, with results 
checked up by a blackboard assignment. A few criticized 
the recitation because it was not organized around big 
topics, and said that the questions and answers were 
scrappy. One supervisor commented as follows: ‘‘I do 
not know how discriminating she is in regard to different 
kinds of reading matter to which she introduces pupils. 
She is capable of a higher type of work.’’ 
Another said, ‘‘The main objective of a silent reading 
lesson is appreciation, and these did!’’ 
D. Remedial Suggestions by Supervisor 
The following are typical of the suggestions that the 
supervisor would make to the teacher. Each one of the 
quotations given below represents the reaction of a single 
supervisor. 
The motive was a worthy one, and you accomplished what you 
set out to do. The class also accomplished what you expected 
them to do. Is there any way of approaching this subject matter 
from a different angle—one that would have a more vital bear- 
ing on their own lives and interest? There was a sense of values 
on the part of the class; they worked willingly and were pleased 
with their accomplishment, but to what extent was this dependent 
upon the teacher and her immediate influence? The organization 
of your subject matter was your weakest point—units were not 
in evidence; all parts were equally stressed; consequently, there 
was no organization on the part of the children. There was some 
evidence of physical initiative but little mental independence. 
You are a strong teacher and can make yourself more of a leader 
in your profession than you are. Broaden your outlook by visit- 
ing, reading, and attendance upon summer schools.
-P-A-G-E-151
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 133 
I surely approve of the methods used by this teacher. The 
lesson shows good preparation and planning. The work does 
not drag out but is welcomed and enjoyed by the entire class. 
What a privilege to have the small chairs for group work! I 
liked the questions used by the teacher. They stimulated thought. 
This on the whole is a splendid class recitation. The teacher’s 
native ability figures prominently here. She can use and knows 
how and when to use facial expression to control and to inspire. 
Her orderly habits are caught by the pupils. She is living the 
life of the children in class and in school—they feel it—the 
community reaps the benefit. As splendid as this recitation is, 
I think the teacher could strengthen the work and help create 
interest by occasionally reading a sentence or paragraph espe- 
cially well. Read for the child to deepen and clarify the thought. 
This teacher can do this beautifully. Her facial expression, 
coupled with her ability to hold words, to phrase, pause, read 
with speed, softly, ete., would challenge the little people to equal 
her. It would take scarcely no time and would put the finishing 
touch on expression which deepens the thought. I doubt the 
policy of asking children to read a verse orally as soon as they 
have read it through silently. Often, those who know or feel 
they can, will raise their hands before reading silently. To avoid 
this a check question should be first given. Several paragraphs 
chosen from different parts of the selection were read but there 
should be continuous reading of many paragraphs or of the whole 
selection. A finished reading of the whole or large parts will 
strengthen the work. 
They did a good piece of work. A little praise would be well 
deserved here. I would suggest that she give children a little 
more chance for self-expression. 
Rapid reading is not always a test of thorough reading. Is 
it wise to call on the pupils who read through the paragraph 
first to read it to the class? 
One supervisor proceeded as follows: 
Supervisor. What did you like best about your lesson? 
Teacher. The response of the pupils. I have tried to work for 
that. 
Supervisor. Very good. I am glad to see your results. You 
have a fine spirit in your room. Your pupils are industrious 
and happy. What do you feel was a weakness in the lesson? 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  134 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. I really don’t know—please tell me. 
Supervisor. There are two phases of silent reading: one, a 
mechanical practice to improve skills, the other, the use 
(unconsciously) of those’ skills (1) to get information for 
its own sake, (2) to read for enjoyment, and (3) to read 
for others aloud later. Each of these phases should receive 
its due amount of attention, but as your pupils are normal, 
the chances are that reading to find answers to definite ques- 
tions has been practiced until your pupils are sufficiently 
efficient. Their skill indicated this. This selection had many 
opportunities for developing appreciation. Did your method 
utilize them? 
Teacher. I am afraid not. How could I have done it? 
Supervisor. Suppose you had said, “Let us read this story 
through to see what it is about. You may have five minutes 
to read it clear through.” Wait for them, help them with 
hard words; then say, “Time is up. What is the story 
about?” Children will answer “a cripple,” ete. “What 
can you do that Peg could not do?’ Get answer. “Do you 
know any crippled children? I wonder if they would like 
this story, too?” Get answers. “What part did you like 
best? Read it aloud. Discuss these as to suggestions for us 
to use our eyes. Look out of the window and find cloud 
pictures if possible.” Have several read and discussed. 
“What other title could the author have used for this story?” 
Get answer. “Which is better do you think? Why?” 
I have tried to emphasize (1) the value of reading a story 
clear through to get the thread of the story, (2) a second 
reading for definite purposes (in this case appreciations 
because of similar experiences, probably.) A reconsidera- 
tion at the end of the whole selection—organizing its parts, 
as it were (in this case supplying a better title). Are these 
features of good study? Are your pupils not ready to begin 
to practice these higher skills of study on material as simple 
as this? 
Teacher. I believe I see how I can raise the level of their work. 
A critical evaluation of this recitation. It appears 
quite evident that the teacher had several definite pur- 
poses in mind. She was working principally for speed 
and comprehension. This she endeavored to obtain by 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 135 
asking questions and requiring pupils to read until they 
were able to give the answers. She worked for apprecia- 
tion of the humor in the story, and succeeded in her pur- 
pose. She attempted to combine with these purposes oral 
reading of an audience type. This is indicated by such 
directions as the following: ‘‘The one who reads it over 
first can read it to me.’’ This is not a true audience 
situation. The teacher succeeded, however, in getting 
good results, not because the pupils felt the necessity of 
reading well orally in order that the teacher might under- 
stand and appreciate the story, but because of her per- 
sonality and the desire on the part of the children to 
read acceptably to her. This method will succeed with 
second-grade children, though it might fail with older 
children. 
There is much to commend in the recitation, and little 
to criticize. The wise supervisor will comment upon the 
happy attitude of pupils and teacher. He will discuss 
with the teacher the uses to which such a selection may 
be put; the results for which the teacher is working; 
how the teacher may test the accomplishment of the 
pupils; seat work of a type that will supplement and 
further the class accomplishment; other selections suit- 
able for the purpose of this recitation; correlations of 
this recitation with language; the possibility of having 
the children read stories to unfortunate children at home, 
and how this may motivate oral reading in a separate 
elass exercise; other methods of improving the speed of 
reading; using a progress book or record card. The 
teacher may be told that the supervisor hopes to send 
others to observe her work, or she may be asked to teach 
a demonstration class before a group of second-grade 
teachers. 
The development of reading abilities. In addition to 
the development of certain fundamental reading habits
-P-A-G-E-154
  136 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
which are considered as the work of the first three grades, 
the teacher of reading should recognize her task of train- 
ing pupils in a number of reading abilities usually in- 
cluded in the general term comprehension. 
It is accepted by most teachers that through proper 
reading exercises pupils should learn to follow directions 
accurately as well as to comprehend and evaluate what 
they read. The girl who reads a recipe in a cookbook 
must be able to interpret and follow the directions given, 
otherwise her pie or cake will be indigestible. She must 
determine whether the directions given in the recipe are 
reasonably accurate or not. The boy who is making a 
toy airplane or a boat, guided by a blueprint or specifica- 
tions given in a book on ‘‘How to Do Things,’’ will meet 
disaster unless he has learned to interpret directions and 
to follow them accurately. 
Teachers of reading and those who compile reading 
books, realizing this, have presented problems and prac- 
tice exercises for the development and mastery of this 
special reading ability. Many attempts to use such exer- 
cises are of little value because too many unfamiliar prob- 
lems not directly related to the purpose of the exercise 
are introduced. In other cases teachers do not realize 
that such exercises should be graded in difficulty of 
thought as well as in vocabulary, and hence fail to obtain 
the results desired.

1. Kind of school: City school in a cultured community. 
2. Teacher: High-school and normal-school graduate with one 
year at the university and four years of teaching experience 
in elementary grades. Businesslike and stimulating. Has 
the happy faculty of securing a natural atmosphere in her 
room without undue freedom. Might be called by some a 
little too lenient. Able to control pupils without undue 
effort, if occasion demands.

8. Learning conditions: Comfortable room, morning period, 
adjustable seats which were fairly well adjusted, and black- 
boards which were clean. Class working as a whole, after 
a rather quiet manner. 
4, Class activity: A language game for the purpose of ear 
training in the use of saw, lying, and haven’t. 
5, Children: Forty-three pupils in group, eight and nine years 
of age, except one border-line slow pupil, twelve years old. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: This class had been 
in the fourth grade three and one-half months, following the 
work in Potter, Jeschke, and Gillet’s Oral and Written 
English, Book I, having completed approximately the first 
fifty pages of the book. This work had been supplemented 
by a great deal of outside work, furnishing opportunity for 
the use of oral composition. Also lessons had been given 
in appreciation of literature and in picture study. In the 
oral work of the past two or three weeks the teacher had 
discovered that several members of the class were habitually 
misusing the words noted above. This served as a motive 
for the lesson, and this need for work was brought to the 
attention of two pupils. 
7. Materials used: A newspaper or two; a near-life situation; 
teacher’s course, MreK AND WiLson, English To-day, Book 
I, page 121, “A Newspaper Game.” 
8. The lesson: The children are seated in order and very ex- 
pectant when the teacher begins the lesson. They have the 
attitude of pupils who anticipate a profitable exercise. 
Teacher. Any one in this room who sells newspapers? [One 
hand raised. Teacher nods appreciation.] We all know 
newsboys, do we not? [Children agree.] To-day we are 
going to play a newspaper game [displaying the news- 
paper]. All sit up straight. I am going to choose a nice 
newsboy, or it may be a girl. [Child chosen, who goes to 
the front of the room.] Now what would a newsboy say 
if he were going to sell a paper? 
John [from his seat, exactly as a child on the street would say 
it]. Journals for sale right here! 
Walter [from his seat]. Milwaukee Journals—right here! 
Teacher [to child in front of room]. Now I want you to walk 
back and forth as if you were selling papers in the street. 
When you see some one, leave some of your papers right
-P-A-G-E-156
  
138 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
here on the front seat and run to the person you are going 
to sell to. Now while he is gone some one will take the 
paper he leaves and put it in his lap. Then what will 
Harold say when he comes back? [Children answer, 
“Where are my papers?”] Then what will he do? [No 
response.] Could he not ask some one about it? What 
could he say? [Child answers, “Have you my papers?”] 
Let us all say that. [Children in concert, “Have you my 
papers?”] Then what would happen? [No response.] 
Could we not say “No, I haven’t your papers, but I saw 
them lying on John’s lap”? [Pointing to John.] Let us 
all say that. [Children repeat twice.] Now we are ready. 
Harold, go back and forth and sell your papers. [Harold 
stands confused and embarrassed.] Sell your papers! 
[Harold tries feebly but cannot say a word.] All right, 
we'll let you try later. Tom, you try. [Tom comes eagerly 
to the front, and shouts, “Journal for sale. Journal here!” 
He fails to leave any of his papers on the front seat. 
The teacher skillfully chooses a child to stand outside the 
door to be the buyer of the paper. Then Tom senses 
the situation, throws down his papers on the front seat, 
carrying only one to the customer. He makes the sale, 
and comes back to look for his papers. In the meantime 
the teacher indicates to a pupil that he is to take the 
paper and pass it to another child. The paper passes 
rapidly from child to child as they sit in their seats. All 
are in order as Tom enters the room.] 
Tom.. Oh, where are my papers? Ruth, have you seen my 
papers [in a truly distressed tone after looking around 
the room hoping to find his papers]? 
Ruth. No, I haven’t your papers but I saw them laying in 
Walter’s lap. 
Teacher. What is the paper going to be doing? 
Class. Lying. 
Teacher. Now these are the things I want you to be careful 
about—I saw it lying. [Ruth repeats correctly.] Go on, 
Tom. ’ 
Tom. Walter, have you seen my papers? 
Walter. No, I haven’t your papers, but I saw them lying on 
Junior’s lap. 
Tom. Junior, have you my papers?
-P-A-G-E-157
    
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 139 
Junior. Yes, I have your papers. [Teacher explains that 
Junior will be the next newsboy, and chooses Edwin to 
go outside. She tells Junior not to come back until she 
calls, “All right,” in order to give a little more time for 
the passing of the papers inside the room. The game 
continues without error and in a spirited manner until 
the fourth newsboy is chosen. During the search for the 
paper Mamie is called upon.] 
Mamie. No, I haven’t got your papers but I saw them lying 
on—— [interrupting in a kind way]. Now, class, what do 
you think about I haven’t got. What do you say, Jimmie? 
Jimmie. I hayen’t your paper. 
Teacher. Do we need got, class? 
Class. No. 
Teacher. No, we can get along without it. [One more news- 
boy is chosen. This time no errors are made by any of 
the pupils. During this part of the game, however, the 
children become very much excited and tear the news- 
papers that they were passing. The teacher rescues the 
torn sheets, refolds them so the game can go on, and 
tells the pupils they must be much more ecareful.] How 
much would you have to pay for this paper? 
Class. Three cents. 
Teacher. Then we cannot afford to tear them. We will try 
it only once more. [Another child is chosen who goes 
through the exercise with a grcat deal of spirit. No 
errors are made.] Now, what are we going to be careful 
about hereafter? We are going to say I saw unless we 
have a helper. Then we may say I have seen. You may 
all sit up tall. First person in each row collect the readers. 
Some rows are so nice and straight. 
9. Comments: There was no seat work following this exercise 
which occupied exactly twenty minutes. Three-fourths of 
the children participated in one way or another, though 
not more than one half of them had opportunity to give 
oral responses. All were thoroughly interested and took 
part mentally in the exercise. The teacher remained at 
the side of the room. The children became boisterous at 
times in the scramble to secure the paper and hide it in 
their laps. Several speech errors, which went unnoticed, 
were made during the exercise. The teacher was fully
-P-A-G-E-158
  140 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK. 
conscious that the children manifested lack of control. 
She attributed this to the fact that they had played but 
very few games of any kind in the classroom during the 
year. For convenience in passing, only one paper was 
left on the front desk, though it was referred to as “pa- 
pers.” 
A. Analysis of the Recitation 
Fifty supervisors, teachers, and graduate students in 
universities reviewed this recitation for analysis and 
evaluation. 
As has been noted in previous reports, the reactions 
of supervisors have varied widely. Most supervisors 
agreed that the physical conditions for learning were 
satisfactory. The exceptions to this statement were the 
suggestions for better adjusted seats and more news- 
papers for so large a class. 
The supervisors appeared to have much difficulty in 
determining whether the material presented was new or 
old. It is essential to know this, since the teacher’s treat- 
ment of the material depends upon the pupils’ familiarity 
with it. The class period is rarely used to carry on the 
study of old material. It is, however, quite evident that 
the lesson was a drill exercise to make automatic certain 
forms of expression. Some supervisors described the les- 
son as: ‘‘a problem to be solved,’’ ‘‘a socialized recita- 
tion,’’ a ‘‘project for better English,’’ ‘‘a poor study 
recitation,’’ ‘‘excellent new material.’’ 
B. Evaluation of Procedure 
1. The method used by the teacher was classified in 
a variety of ways, such as: ‘‘a game to get habitual use 
of correct English,’’? ‘‘a good one—not masters of it,’’ 
“‘teacher’s, not child’s, yet within his experience,’’ ‘‘drill, 
—good,’’ ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘not good,’’ ‘‘fair.’’ 
2. Accuracy of manipulation of tools on the part of
-P-A-G-E-159
    
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 141 
the teacher was considered ‘‘poor,’’ ‘‘fair,’’ ‘‘satisfac- 
tory.”’ 
8. The organization of material was classified as 
“around type sentences,’’ ‘‘fair,’’? ‘‘not complete,’’ 
““goo0d,’’ ‘‘not good.’’ 
4. In scoring motivation, one supervisor thought that 
the game was uppermost in the minds of the children, 
not the material employed; another found some evidences 
of motivation; a third felt that the need for such a les- 
son was sufficiently manifest to the teacher; others rated 
it as ‘‘fair,’’ ‘‘good.’’ 
5. In fertility of suggestion the work of the teacher 
was judged to be fair, average, good. One observer be- 
lieved that the teacher failed to bring prompt response. 
6. In measuring the accomplishment of the pupil the 
following estimates were given: 
(a) The interest shown by the pupils was generally 
rated as ‘‘good,’’ although two qualified this statement by 
saying that the interest was in the action and not in the 
subject matter. 
(b) The initiative displayed by the pupils was rated 
variously as ‘‘poor,’’ ‘‘not much,’’ ‘‘fair,’’ ‘‘some,’’ ‘‘not 
sufficient,’’ ‘‘none of high type,’’ ‘‘good,’’ and ‘‘much—in 
the activity of the game.’’ 
(c) The pupils were believed by some to have done 
nothing in organizing the materials. By others, organiz- 
ing materials was rated as ‘‘poor,’’ ‘‘slight,’’ ‘‘fair,’’ and 
“good.”’ 
(d) The pupils’ mastery of the assignment was de- 
seribed as: ‘‘not at all,’’ ‘‘fairly well,’’ ‘‘satisfactorily,”’ 
“‘no evidence here,’’ and ‘‘this will be tested later.’’ 
C. Summary of Evaluation of Recitation 
Every possible type of answer was given to the ques- 
tion, ‘‘Was the purpose of the teacher realized?’? The 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  142 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
purpose ‘‘was not realized,’’ ‘‘was not realized until near 
the close of the recitation,’ ‘‘was only partially realized,’’ 
“‘was realized for the present time, but repeated drills 
would have to be given to make its realization perma- 
nent.’’ Many supervisors stated that the drill was not 
effective because of insufficient repetition. One said, ‘‘ Her 
route was too long.’’ Another believed that the children 
who did not need the drill should have been exempted. 
The scramble to get papers and the boisterousness of the 
class offset the advantage of motivation in the judgment 
of many, and diverted the pupils from the real aim, which 
was ear-training in correct form of verbs. One critic said, 
“‘T see no evidence of real thinking on the part of the 
ehild.’’ Another, ‘‘No more than one-half of the class 
had an opportunity to, give oral response.’’ Another, 
“‘The children should make the corrections in English, 
not the teacher.’’ Others, ‘‘Freedom of action and ease 
of self-expression were developed,’’ ‘‘The situation was 
a real one,’’ ‘‘To me the situation was quite artificial. 
Newsboys do not sit up straight necessarily. People do 
not usually take and hand or pass on the papers.’’ 
D. Remedial Suggestions by Supervisors 
The following statements are typical of the suggestions 
that supervisors would make to this teacher: 
Purpose would be more completely realized by more compre- 
hensive study and use of desired words. I would suggest some 
written work based on these words mentioned in teachers’ pur- 
pose. Conduet of class is not a matter of serious concern in this 
exercise, but should be mentioned. 
Probably Potter, Jeschke, and Gillet provide for games similar 
to this. Do they? I find in their book that a good model lesson 
in playing games to fix correct forms is given. You are helping 
to make every pupil and yourself skillful in conversation. This 
is not an easy thing to do, but it is a great asset for those that
-P-A-G-E-161
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 143 
ean. I feel certain you should keep at it until you do it easily 
and artistically. Did you [to the teacher] choose the boy with 
news-selling experience to begin the game? Why is a good 
beginning so important? Do you ever take part yourself as a 
person playing the game? Is there any advantage in taking 
part? Do groups of children frequently prepare games to teach 
troublesome forms? What would the auditors learn from such 
an exercise? I shall be here soon again. What forms shall I 
prepare to teach through a game for you? 
In teaching the words saw, lying, and haven’t I would suggest 
that you [to the teacher] handle your material so that in teaching 
such words you go about it as follows: If you are using the 
“newspaper game,” lay the papers on the news-stand and ask, 
“Where are the papers?” Answer: “I saw them yesterday.” 
“Have you sold any papers?” “I haven’t sold any papers,” 
ete. Try this or a similar method in your language games and 
you will at once bring the aim of the lesson to the children, 
thereby arousing their interest in such a way that they will use 
initiative, ask questions, and give quick responses. Drill well. 
Allow the children original expressions using the words saw, 
lying, haven’t. 
You [to the teacher] should follow up this exercise with seat 
work. Write a story emphasizing particularly the problems of 
using correctly the words for study. Try to have the pupils exer- 
cise better self-control. Let the children criticize each other’s 
questions and answers after each sale instead of interrupting. 
See how many “sales” can be made in all. I would suggest either 
a different seating arrangement or a better adjustment of seats. 
By using the game, the errors which were to be corrected were 
submerged. The pupils enjoyed the playing of the game, but 
further than that, the lesson proved almost a failure. The idea 
of the drill is good, but it was not used to serve its purpose. Is 
it wise to ignore other grammatical errors which occurred during 
the lesson? I should consider a long time before using language 
games, and then be sure to choose the right kind. 
I would suggest using this lesson several times with intervals 
of a day or two between, and then test by the use of words in 
some other situation. As this was the first lesson of the kind, I 
would like to see one or two more before offering any other sug-
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
gestions. I would want to see if the teacher and pupils gained 
in skill in carrying this lesson or game out more wns and 
more quickly. 
Harold needed aid. There is no evidence that he was helped. 
It was a farce, I fear. The teacher repeated the child’s error, 
thus intensifying the impression of the child’s error. Teacher is 
undoubtedly intensely interested in making connections between 
child and life. In my estimation she needs very much construc- 
tive, purposeful supervision that will show her the great problems 
and how to find them. She seems to be making the device the 
eenter of the activity. 
I am glad to see that you [to the teacher] are attempting to 
correct the common errors in speech. Do you have your class 
list errors? [Explain how it may be interestingly done.] 
Haven’t you found it hard to break old habits of speech? We 
do have to go very slowly and make the work interesting, too. 
For this reason you would probably accomplish more by taking 
one word at a time, saw for example. Your newspaper game was 
good and with a few changes you could have a splendid drill on 
saw. I noticed by your summary that you considered only the 
word saw. Lying and haven’t were omitted. Why? Don’t you 
think that you could have asked a question which would have 
eaused your class to summarize for you? All young teachers 
are apt to do too much thinking for their classes. You have a 
large group. No wonder they were noisy! Did the entire class 
need this drill? Maybe those who didn’t could have been given 
some hard work to do! Children usually listen to games, but 
this would not have interfered with their work. I notice that you 
had no follow-up seat work. Yes, an interesting paragraph with 
the drill words would be good. Tell them to save me the correct 
papers to show to other children. Let me know how you succeed 
in eliminating errors in speech. I shall be most interested. 
Supervisor. Your idea of the language game was commendable, 
and this game, at first sight, seems very well suited to the 
need. What is your own judgment of how it served your 
purpose? 
Teacher. I think it developed into a physical-exercise game 
period—too much action and too little thinking. 
Supervisor. I would agree with you. The physical activity out- 
weighed the mental activity certainly. That might not always 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 145 
be a fault. Why did you fee’ that this was an error in this 
ease? 
Teacher. I felt that the class lost sight of what I was trying to 
teach, and thought just of getting the paper. 
Supervisor. Perhaps you are right. I would express it this 
way: There are definite things to do in putting a new habit 
in place of an old one. Can we state them? 
. Have a desire to form the new habit. 
. Use every opportunity to practice it. 
. Practice it consciously, thinking why we do it. 
Permit no lapses. 
. Overlearn it. 
. Use it frequently. Op Ope 
For how many of these principles did your lesson provide? 
Teacher. Probably one, No. 2. 
Supervisor. How could we have included the others? I would 
say in your introduction, write the correct forms on the 
board. Speak more of their value. Suggest that each pupil 
answer to himself. How could you reduce the physical 
activity? 
Teacher. By having a chosen pupil hand the paper to another. 
Supervisor. Yes, much better. The game is only a means to 
the end. Who should have given the summary at the close, 
teacher or class? 
Teacher. I should have required that of them. 
Supervisor. Could you plan a game for some of these errors 
[handing the teacher the unnoticed errors] and let me see 
it? You have shown a high degree of skill in other aspects 
of your language work. Let us develop skill in carrying on 
language games. Games have a legitimate place in drill 
work, but they must be only prominent enough to furnish 
the situation. The child needs to realize that the game is 
just to help him do the real thinking that is needed in 
forming a new habit. What further practice do you intend 
to provide for the use of this new habit? Be ready to 
answer that when I come in to see your lesson.

6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The past sixteen 
weeks had been given to the study of the United States, 
basing the work largely on the physical features. Con- 
siderable attention had been paid to the processes involved 
in the various industries. The dependencies of the United 
States were now being studied. The immediate lesson was 
introduced by asking the children what they knew of Alaska. 
This determined, they were asked if they would like to 
learn more about it. To stimulate their study, the following 
assignment was placed upon the board. Similar assign- 
ments had been used throughout the year. 
Problem: 
i Why was Alaska called ‘‘Seward’s Folly’? 
(a) Who was Seward? 
(b) What does folly mean [dictionary]?

8. The lesson: The teacher pulls down near the class a map 
showing the entire continent of North America. 
Teacher. Name the countries of North America. Go to the 
map and locate them. [Robert does this.] 
Teacher. Which one have we studied very carefully? Frank. 
Frank. The United States. 
Teacher. Will you locate Alaska for us? George. [Complies 
inaccurately.] Will you locate Alaska again for us, 
Richard? [Complies.] All right. What did we call 
Alaska? Ruth. 
Ruth. <A territory. 
Teacher. A territory. What might it become some day? 
Class. 
Class. A state. 
Teacher. If it becomes a state what will happen to our flag, 
Myrtle? 
Myrtle. We would have another star. 
Teacher. Then how many will we have? 
Class. Forty-nine. 
Teacher. We have a problem on the board this morning. 
Why was Alaska called “Seward’s Folly’? Who was 
Seward? And what did he do? [Looks around class 
and waits a moment until several hands are raised.] 
Arline. 
Arline. Seward was a Secretary of State in Lincoln’s 
Cabinet. He urged the purchase of Alaska. 
Teacher. To whom did this land belong? Carol. 
Carol. Russia. 
Teacher. Where is Russia? 
George. Europe. 
Teacher. Seward finally persuaded the United States to buy 
it. How much did they pay for it, Tom? 
Tom. $7,200,000. 
Teacher. Why did they call it “Seward’s Folly”? Why was it 
foolishness to buy this, Dorothy? 
Dorothy. It was all mountains and rough. 
Teacher. What would you call the mountains and the rough- 
ness of the land? 
Dorothy. The surface. 
Teacher. Tell us more about the surface of the land, 
Margaret.
-P-A-G-E-166
ee ee re enn 
148 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Margaret. In some places there were a lot of mountains and 
in other places it was level. 
Teacher. What mountain ranges reach into Alaska? Robert. 
Robert. Rocky Mountains. 
Teacher. Please locate the Rocky Mountain system, the posi- 
tion, on the map. [Richard does this quickly.] All right. 
Are there any important peaks in Alaska, Richard? 
Richard. Mt. McKinley. 
Teacher. Can you locate it? [Richard, who sits near the 
map, can see the name.] Just about where is it? Don’t 
look for the name. Another one. Ruth. 
Ruth. Mt. St. Elias. 
Teacher. Now locate it. Just about where? Don’t look for 
the names ever on the map. [Ruth points approximately 
to the right place.] Alaska has many voleanoes and much 
beautiful scenery, and I am going to let some one find 
out about a great discovery. There are three pamphlets 
on my desk that tell about this. George, Margaret, and 
Catherine may read about the pictures in the three books. 
They are very interesting. [These are cuttings from the 
National Geographic Magazine regarding volcanoes, hot 
springs, ete.] What great river flows through Alaska? 
Locate it on the map. 
Tom. Yukon River. [Pointed correctly.] 
Teacher. We'll come back to that and find out why it is so 
important. Is there any farming in Alaska? Cameron. 
Cameron. It’s too cold for farming. 
Teacher. Tell us something about the climate in Alaska, 
Dorothy. 
Dorothy. It was cold in the winter in the mountains, but in 
the summer it was warmer than we would think it would be. 
Richard [volunteering]. In most places in the northern part 
[pointing] there are Eskimos. Down here [pointing] 
there is some farming. 
Teacher. In what zone is Alaska located? George. 
George. In Frigid and North Temperate Zones. 
Teacher. If it is in two zones, what circle crosses it? Carol. 
Carol. Arctic [locating it when asked to do so]. 
Teacher. Locate the North Frigid Zone [done correctly]. 
About how much of Alaska would you say is in the North 
Frigid Zone?  
-P-A-G-E-167
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 149 
Vernon. About one-third. 
Teacher. About one-third. Now we have the reasons why it 
was called “Seward’s Folly.” Now we didn’t take what 
one? What was the one we forgot to talk about? [Class 
looks at the outline on the board and says, “Size.”] How 
large is Alaska? Margaret. 
Margaret. About one-fifth the size of the United States. 
Teacher. Did the United States need all of this land when they 
bought it? Arline. 
Arline. There was very much land in the United States at 
that time. They didn’t need this land. 
Teacher. They didn’t need this land. Now we've taken up 
the surface, climate, cost, and size. Did it turn out as the 
people expected? A big folly, a useless possession? 
[Calls attention to outline.] George. 
George. It did not. 
Teacher. Tell us some things that proved it was not a folly. 
George. The fishing. 
Teacher. Tell us about the fishing in Alaska. 
George. It was the most important thing. Every year thou- 
sands of salmon come up there. They just have to take 
them out of the water. 
Teacher. Tell us about the salmon fish. Does any one know 
about its size? Who'll take salmon fish for Monday? 
George, you may take it [after waiting to see that there 
was no response]. Where will you look for that? 
George. In a library book. 
Teacher. How will you know where to look for it after you 
get the book? 
Pupil. He might look for Alaska. 
Teacher. He might look for Alaska. 
Pupil. Look for salmon. 
Teacher. Look for salmon and for the exact pages to read. 
Find out how important salmon are in value. What about 
the fish? How valuable are they? [No response.] Let 
us look in our books and find out. [Pupils open their 
books and read quickly.] Close books. Arline. 
Arline. We get every year out of the salmon as much as 
Alaska cost us. 
Teacher. I have here some pictures that may be used for 
reports. Who would like them? [Hands are raised and
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
pictures are given to Tom, Dorothy, and Vernon. These 
are three Keystone stereographs dealing with salmon.] 
There is another thing very valuable in Alaska. Tom. 
Tom. Seals. 
Teacher. Tell us about seals. 
Tom. Some of the seals are used for sealskin coats, which 
cost several hundreds of dollars. We have had seven 
times as much money from seals as we paid for Alaska. 
Teacher. Another industry that will prove more important? 
Tell us about it. 
Arline. Gold mines. The men came up to work the mines, 
and it became more important than the fish. 
Teacher. What big gold mine is near Alaska, do you know? 
Richard. 
Richard. Klondike. In the northeastern part. 
Teacher. Locate it on the map. [Richard fails but George 
corrects it.| What river was used as a trail in reaching 
the gold mines? 
Class. The Yukon. 
Teacher. Now we have two reasons why the Yukon was im- 
portant. First, for the salmon fish, and second, to reach 
the gold fields. Why haven’t they railroads in Alaska to 
earry gold here and there? Margaret. 
Margaret. On account of the mountains. 
Teacher. What other industry have they? 
Class. Farming. 
Teacher. Locate farming regions on the map. [Pupil pointed 
to southwestern part.] Now we find something growing 
that may turn out to be of great value to the United 
States in future years. 
Class. Lumbering. 
Teacher. Who will take gold as a report for Monday? Let’s 
have two boys on that, because it is so hard. [Richard 
and Robert volunteer. They are given Allen, Industrial 
Studies of North America as a reference, and told to look 
in other places also.] Now, class, would you say that 
Seward committed a great folly in persuading the United 
States to buy Alaska? How many think he did? [No 
hands raised.] Is there any one in the class who has not 
a report now? [Six hands raised.] Arline, you may take 
the capital of Alaska. Myrtle, you may take the impor-
-P-A-G-E-169
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 151 
tant city of Fairbanks, and Frank, you may take Sitka. 
Ruth, Carol, and Cameron may each take one of these 
stereographs [handing them appropriate material on 
Alaska]. Every one has his lesson for Monday now. 
Does every one know where he is going to look for his 
topic? What book are you going to use, Frank? 
Frank. One of the books on the window sill. 
Teacher. If you can’t find it there, where? 
Frank. Encyclopedia. 
Teacher. You can always find it there. All ready, books 
closed. Ready for recess. 
9. Comments: The lesson occupied twenty minutes. It moved 
rapidly, though the teacher gave pupils opportunity to 
volunteer after each question before she called upon the 
next individual. The children were comfortable, alert, and 
conscious of the forward movement of the lesson, feeling 
that something worth while was happening. 
This exercise was submitted to a number of supervisors 
for analysis, evaluation, and constructive suggestions. 
Their evaluations are given below: 
oe wOnr . The purpose of the teacher was inadequate. 
. The problem did not touch the pupils at any point. 
. There was no desire on the part of the pupils to continue 
because of a felt need. 
. Pupils were getting facts, not power. 
. The organization of materials was that of the teacher, not 
the pupils. The teacher was too conspicuous, and held 
the center of the stage. 
. The teacher formulated all the questions and stated all the 
conclusions. The pupils did not have sufficient opportunity 
for participation nor for exercise of initiative. 
. The lesson developed into a question and answer type— 
the teacher “pumping” for everything she got. 
. There was no motivation. Too many facts and too little 
development. 
. Many questions were poorly framed—leading and sugges- 
tive of answers. 
. The order of procedure was not logical. 
. The lesson lacked thoroughness.  
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
12, The teacher showed skill in directing pupils to definite 
sources of information. 
13. The teacher illustrated very well the need for supplement- 
ing the author’s contribution. 
14. There was some evaluating done by pupils. 
15. A definite assignment was made. 
Remedial Suggestions by Supervisors 
One supervisor said: 
I would call attention to the necessity for providing situations 
to draw forth questions from the children—to provide discus- 
sions for free expression of thought. I would suggest that she 
be more careful of her English. 
Another offered the following suggestion: 
Why not lead the pupils to ask questions and organize facts? 
Would not the lesson mean more to the class if Alaska were 
compared with the other dependencies of the United States? 
Still another supervisor believed that the ‘‘high light’’ 
of a problem lesson comes when the pupil becomes 
teacher : 
I should first commend the interest and spirit of the class, the 
fact that the aim was clearly set up, and that the lesson went 
along effectively to the realization of the aim. I should ask if 
she did not generally prefer a single main question or problem 
for the lesson. I should say that her problem as selected seemed 
to work very well, and that she asked some good questions. 
I should then inquire if she had the children ask questions some- 
times, and what value she attached to pupils’ questions. I should 
ask her if she sometimes lets the pupils choose what topics they 
would like to look up, and if she sometimes lets the pupils dis- 
eover what topics should be looked up. I should ask her what 
she thought of this method: instead of her asking the next 
question at some point, for her to say instead, “What is the next 
question we should ask here?” letting the pupils find this question 
as well as the answer. I would suggest that this could be done 
occasionally. Gradually the pupils might ask more and the 
teacher fewer questions. The pupils could be led to discuss the
-P-A-G-E-171
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 153 
topics with each other, asking questions of each other part of 
the time. I should close by telling her it was an excellent lesson. 
The next supervisor said: 
I would suggest the following: 
1. A eareful study of the socialized recitation. 
2. The possibility of developing leadership through pupil par- 
ticipation in organized classes or groups. 
3. The value of thought-provoking questions. 
4. A visit to a school in which the socialized recitation and the 
project method have been highly developed. 
One supervisor suggested: 
1. Teacher needs to discover children’s capacity to carry a 
heavy load eagerly, and give abundantly, under proper stimulus. 
2. Teacher needs assistance in discovering problems that really 
touch the lives of the children and have fruitful issues. 
3. Teacher needs to organize her material in such units that 
she will cease to pelt the class with detailed questions upon which 
they learn to depend. 
4. The children need to be given skill in assembling and 
organizing material related to a topic, and further skill in pre- 
senting the complete unit to the class. 
The organization of material in terms of industries 
known to the pupils was suggested by another supervisor 
in the following statement: 
Your class seemed to be interested in the lesson and are 
eertainly well behaved. Since you had studied much about 
industries in the United States, would it not have been a good 
plan to attack the new topic from that angle? Since you are 
quite well supplied with material, do you think that the children 
could have used more of it than they did? We all learn to do 
by doing. These children are so anxious to please you; let them 
feel that they are of real assistance. They need to gain power 
more than information. The lesson was a question and answer 
type and really a test for information. Use thought questions 
as often as you can. You and your class might have worked out 
some such an outline as this:
-P-A-G-E-172
  154 . VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
eal—what waters Fishing ......... {iitecs- shee watare 
Market for 
Gold—where found— 
{ near what waters 
Industries 
Kinds of trees 
Means of transporta- 
Lumbering .....- tion 
Uses of 
Markets for 
Then you would have started on familiar ground, and, con- 
stantly relating the new knowledge, you could finally have it so 
tied up with their former knowledge that it would mean much 
more to them. They would also be more likely to remember it. 
You have a good opportunity for a socialized recitation Monday. 
I am glad to see you plan for it. 
The organization of the data around topics or questions 
in the minds of pupils was suggested by one supervisor. 
This supervisor indicated a way of starting the activity 
in the minds of the children as follows: 
I am, indeed, glad to see that you are providing well-worked- 
out central thoughts for the pupils to study toward. Your 
outline fitted the text very well. I was in hopes you would sit 
or stand at the side of the class and begin something like this: 
“Who can think of some of the things we ought to talk about 
before we discuss the first question on the board—something 
about Alaska not suggested by this outline?” This would start 
your class at once thinking beyond the text. It would require 
them to organize data around a topic or question in their own 
minds, and stimulate them to have independence enough to rise 
and state their own results of thinking [a most valuable activity 
to develop in our classes]. 
One or two supplementary questions on your part would clear 
the way for the discussion, but the activity would have started 
in the children’s minds; statements not valuable could have been 
culled out [this giving them practice in judging values]. Also 
many features of the work that are hazy in their minds are 
brought to light when they are required to use their information.
-P-A-G-E-173
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 155 
Then your lesson could have continued by having the topics dis- 
cussed from the board, but not from your questions—and you 
could have done that very skillful piece of work you did in intro- 
ducing the references for the following day. I am going to 
tell you that for every word a pupil uttered you spoke at least 
one and one-half times as many. For your type of lesson, what 
would you say about this? May I suggest a few things you can 
do to overcome this situation? 
1. Plan beforehand how you are going to start every lesson 
to shift the talking to the pupils. You can safeguard in advance 
at least the first five minutes of each recitation lesson. 
2. Stand at the side and nod without speaking to pupils who 
look as if they could go on. 
3. Make out the questions you expect to need in advance. 
See how few you can formulate that will cover the lesson material 
outside of that provided for in your written assignment which 
the pupils have. 
4, Learn to sit in the back of the room occasionally and be 
one of the group—a learner with them. See how much they can 
do without you. 
5. Read Branom, The Teaching of Geography. 
The criticisms and suggestions of the supervisors center 
around the following points: 
1. Pupils should ask the questions and organize the facts. 
2. Pupils should, often, choose the topics to be looked up and 
discussed. 
3. Socialization of the recitation. 
4. Thought-provoking questions. 
5. Ratio of pupil activity to teacher activity. 
In reality, this lesson, instead of being a problem, was 
largely ‘‘memory work with an improved organization of 
subject matter.’’ The selection and organization of the 
materials was the teacher’s, not the pupil’s. 
At the time when this lesson was presented reindeer 
meat from Alaska was being advertised and sold in cer- 
tain meat markets of the city. The papers were also full 
of statements concerning former President Harding’s trip
-P-A-G-E-174
  156 = =VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
to Alaska. His means of transportation, the places he 
visited, the industries he investigated, even the food he 
ate, were made familiar to every American reader of the 
newspapers. These presented two points of departure for 
a real problem. 
Chapter summary. In the earlier chapters many sug- 
gestions have been given to aid supervisors in analyzing 
accurately ordinary teaching situations, and to guide 
them in making vital remedial suggestions. In comment- 
ing upon the supervisors’ handling of the ‘‘case studies’’ 
given in this chapter, the authors do not intend to limit 
the acceptable analysis of these recitations to the brief 
treatment they have accorded to each, but rather do they 
desire to direct the reader’s attention again to the aids 
to analysis given in Chapter II, and to methods of help- 
ing the teacher discussed in Chapters III and IV. It is 
hoped that thoughtful study of these lessons as reported 
will reveal a finer technique of supervision in these par- 
ticular ‘‘cases’’ than has been secured from supervisors 
or suggested by the authors.

CHAPTER VII 
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES OF TEACHING (continued) 
The critical analysis of teaching. An earlier chapter 
gave in some detail the procedure for analyzing the work 
of the teacher. It was there stated that to be effective, 
analysis must be unbiased, accurate, and systematic. The 
purpose of this chapter is to present a number of con- 
erete teaching situations, with the supervisor’s criticism 
thereof, as well as a critical discussion of each. For pur- 
poses of this discussion the chapter is divided into two 
sections: (1) a critical analysis of the supervisor’s evalu- 
ations of teaching; and (2) problems and exercises in 
analyzing teaching. The principles applied in the analysis 
are those outlined in the second chapter of this book. 
I. A Orrrican Anatysis or THE SuPERVisOR’s EVALUATION 
or TEACHING 
Supervisors often fail to evaluate critically. Some 
supervisors do not know good teaching when they see it. 
Others have a pretty fair notion of what constitutes good 
teaching, in general, but have not developed the critical 
sense for details. The ability to evaluate teaching criti- 
cally is not a heaven-bestowed gift, but an ability that 
comes through knowledge and practice in the skillful 
observation of good teaching. A general comment, favor- 
able or unfavorable, is more or less worthless. Instead, 
say, ‘‘Your devices for saving time were particularly 
good’’; ‘‘The number of questions asked by the pupils 
158 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 159 
was certainly good to see’’; ‘‘The interest in getting the 
problem under way was quite unusual.’’ 
Before reading the examples to follow, turn to the gen- 
eral standards, pages 22-32, and reread them carefully. 
A History Lesson, Grapz 8B 
1. Kind of school: Medium-sized graded school in central part 
of city, drawing pupils from all types of homes. 
2. Teacher: High-school and normal-school graduate with 
varied experience over a period of six years. A stable, 
stimulating teacher who was able to bring out the best 
qualities of her class, and encourage them to put forth 
steady effort. 
8. Learning conditions: Morning period of a clear day; light~ 
ing, correct; temperature, favorable to work. The seating 
conditions recently adjusted to suit changing pupil needs. 
Class alert and ready for work. 
4. Class activity: A question and answer recitation on “cam- 
paign around Vicksburg.” 
5. Children: Sixteen pupils, two of whom were at least two 
years over age. Twelve were normal, and two were a little 
above normal, especially in their ability to memorize. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The past thirty-two 
weeks had been spent on United States history. One more 
week was to be devoted to the Civil War. The method used 
had been largely discussion and question and answer work. 
The pupils were led to understand the industrial develop- 
ment, and to trace economic reasons for conditions. 
Leadership and service had been emphasized whenever 
possible. Little time had been given to the details of wars, 
but pupils were helped to see how wars were planned, to 
follow large movements, and to estimate outcomes. Topies 
or questions had always heen given to guide the study. 
New problems or historical events were introduced with a 
study recitation. The assignment for the lesson follows: 
1. Why did Grant want to capture New Orleans? 
2. Be able to locate: 
(a) Forts Henry, Donelson 
(b) Shiloh 
(c) New Orleans 
(d) Vicksburg
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
3. Why did the South want to establish friendly relations 
with England? 
(a) How did this lead to the ‘‘Trent Affair?’’ 
7. Materials used: Blackboard, blackboard outline wall map. 
Reference books and varied texts. Each pupil had the 
privilege of owning any one of the following texts and bor- 
rowing one other: 
THWAITES AND KENDALL (Houghton Mifflin) 
Gorpy (Scribner). 
WoopBurNn AND Moran, Elementary American History and Gov- 
ernment (Longmans) 
Bourne anD Benton (Heath) 
8. The lesson: Class comes to attention without any direction 
from the teacher as soon as she steps to the front of the 
room and draws down the wall map over the assignment. 
Teacher. Books closed. Why did Grant take the Mississippi? 
What was the importance of the Mississippi at this time, 
Robert? 
Robert. Because if they got to the Mississippi they could 
easily transport their supplies. 
Teacher. Besides transporting supplies what else made the 
Mississippi so important? Picture the Mississippi. Can’t 
you picture the Mississippi? What did it do to the South? 
[Hands raised.] Richard. 
Richard. They couldn’t get out at all [meaning the South]. 
Teacher. Did it help them internally or externally? What 
states did it cut off, Ruth? 
Ruth. Mississippi. [Teacher says, “Watch out.’] Texas, 
California, Oregon. 
Pupils [protesting]. California and Oregon? 
Ruth. Kansas. [Teacher indicates that Ruth should sit.] 
Class. Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. 
Teacher. The South moved their supplies from Texas right 
north to what city? [No response.] What city has to 
have its burying ground above ground? What city is 
famous for that? 
Class. New Orleans. 
Teacher. Then if the North had the Mississippi River, what 
would it do to the South, George? 
George. It would cut off supplies from Arkansas and Texas, 
and would also give them a chance to get Vicksburg.
-P-A-G-E-179
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 161 
Teacher. We were to be able to locate Forts Henry and 
Donelson. Margaret, take chalk, and make a cross where 
you think Fort Henry is located. [Incorrectly done.] 
What has she forgotten to pay attention to, class? 
Class. The Tennessee River. [Pupil tries again.] 
Teacher. Who else will try? [Hands raised.] Vernon. 
[Puts cross in approximately right place for Fort Henry 
on the Tennessee River.] Now make a cross for Fort 
Donelson. [Correctly done.] Now we'll locate Shiloh, 
Florence. [Incorrectly done.] What river flows near 
Shiloh? 
Pupil [volunteering]. The Ohio. 
Teacher. No. 
Pupil [volunteering]. The Mississippi. [Hands raised.] 
Teacher. Dorothy. 
Dorothy. I think it is here on the Tennessee. That flows 
into the Ohio [locating it with reasonable correctness]. 
Teacher. Who can locate the Pittsburgh Landing and Chatta- 
nooga? [Volunteers.] Cameron. [Cameron goes to map 
and locates them in Kentucky on the Cumberland River.] 
Which way is the northern army logically going to move? 
Now where is Chattanooga? [Pupil hesitates.] Put it 
in Tennessee on the Tennessee River. [Child then cor- 
rects his error and locates both with fair correctness. ] 
What city did they have to capture before they got 
to Vicksburg? [Several hands are raised.] Robert. 
[Robert locates it correctly near the mouth of the Missis- 
sippi.] Locate the next place for us, Edwin. [He has 
trouble in finding the right state.] What is it? 
Edwin. Vicksburg. 
Teacher. Put it right here on the Mississippi River [helping 
him]. That opened what river, class? 
Class. The Mississippi. 
Teacher. Why do rivers play so important a part in any 
war, Mary? 
Mary. Because they transport troops easily. 
Teacher. What famous battle was fought over a river in the 
_ World War? 
Pupil. The Marne. 
Teacher. How many know what part rivers play in the for- 
mation of new countries to-day? George.
-P-A-G-E-180
  162 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
George. They make boundary lines. 
Earl [volunteering]. It’s an advantage to have natural 
boundaries. 
Teacher. Suppose this [pointing to land west of the Missis- 
sippi] belonged to France, and this [pointing to land 
east of the Mississippi] belonged to England. What would 
they both want to do? 
Class. Both would want to own the Mississippi. 
Teacher. Who can think of a similar river in Europe which 
two countries want, and one country lost a strip of a few 
miles between their boundary and the river? [Some one 
says, The Danube.] Yes, two countries wanted that, but 
this is between France and Germany. [Pupil says, The 
Rhine.] Yes [going to the outline map and explaining 
from the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, likening them 
to the Rhine and the Seine]. Now suppose this is France 
and this is Germany. Each wanted to reach the other 
country’s principal river. A long time ago France lost 
this little country of Alsace-Lorraine. Now she has it 
back again, but it figured in two wars. The same is true 
about the Danube. Bulgaria and Roumania both wanted 
the river. Now you see why the Mississippi was so impor- 
tant. Why did the South want to establish commercial 
relations with England? Why did they want to establish 
trade with England? [Topic 3 of the outline on the board 
under the map.] Isabel. 
Isabel. The South didn’t raise many crops, except cotton, 
rice, and sugar, and they wanted to get things from 
England. 
Teacher. How did they do it, Dorothy? 
Dorothy. They sent an ambassador over there to tell them 
that they wanted their trade. 
Teacher. We don’t call them ambassadors. We call them 
commissioners. Who were they? Russell. 
Russell. Mason and Slidell. 
Teacher. Why did they not reach England, Joseph? 
Joseph. They were captured by an American Union ship 
and taken to Boston. 
Teacher. What grounds did he have for taking them? 
Joseph. [No response.] I should think that would be an 
interesting thing. How would an American dare to 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 163 
take these men from the ship belonging to England, 
Dorothy? 
Dorothy. They took them as prisoners of war because we 
were fighting with the South. 
Teacher. What was the attitude of the Americans? [Six 
hands raised.] Vernon. 
Vernon. Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer, and he said we had 
no right to capture them because we did not allow it in 
1812, and we could not do it now. 
Teacher. I don’t want about Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln didn’t 
always express the views of the American people. Edwin, 
ean you tell? 
Edwin. The northern people were very much pleased, and 
Captain Wilkes was given a big banquet to celebrate what 
he had done. 
Teacher. There were a few who did not celebrate. Who was 
one, Isabel? 
Isabel. Lincoln. 
Teacher. Why did Lincoln claim it wasn’t right? 
Isabel. Because it was against international law. 
Teacher. What’s international law? Can you tell us, Russell? 
Russell. Neutral ships are allowed to sail freely. 
Teacher. What ship were they on? 
Russell. An English ship. 
Teacher. England said, “We are neutral, and you have no 
right to stop our ships.” Do you remember what argu. 
ment was used by Germany in the sinking of the Lusi- 
tania? 
Class. She carried contraband of war. 
Teacher. There is always apt to be a dispute about such 
matters. Now what was done with these two men, Mary? 
Mary. Set free. 
Teacher. They were not only set free but sent on their 
way to? 
Class [completing sentence]. England. 
Vernon [volunteering]. I don’t see how a ship has the right 
to go into a country and take the men. 
Teacher. Did we have any right to stop the men from the 
southern states going to England? Class. 
Class. No. 
Teacher. We can stop them in a way, that is, if they were

164 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
bringing supplies to the South, but we can’t stop ambassa- 
dors any more than England could have said, “We are at 
war with Germany, and the American ambassador cannot 
go to Germany.” How did we know how far out on the 
ocean we could stop ships carrying ammunition to the 
South, Clarence? 
Clarence. We could stop them when they got to the three- 
mile limit. . 
Teacher. Then a blockade can be how many miles out at sea, 
class? 
Class. Three miles. 
Teacher. After that it is called high seas and is free to all. 
No one can settle these affairs entirely. There is so much 
to the international law I could not answer all ques- 
tions. 
Vernon. Why did they send these men‘on their way to Eng- 
land after they stopped them? 
Teacher. We made an error. So we must try to make it all 
right. The South had established a vigorous trade with 
England. What did the blockade do, Joseph? 
Joseph. It prevented the ships from going out or in. 
Teacher. Did they blockade in the World War? 
Class. Yes. 
Teacher. Now where? 
Class. North Sea. 
Teacher. What did Germany use to try to enforce the block- 
ade, which we claim is really against international law? 
Joseph. 
Joseph. Submarines. 
Teacher. That’s what Germany tried to do. Now going back 
to our map. Logically where were we in the Civil War? 
[Class mumbles a confusion of answers.] I want lips 
still and something done. Remember that the Peninsular 
Campaign was a failure. Where was the next move, 
Joseph? 
Joseph. Georgia. 
Teacher. Why to Georgia, Earl? 
Earl. Because that’s where the capital was. 
Teacher. I thought the capital was in Virginia, Florence. 
Florence. Because Georgia had lots of ammunition and, 
though it had not improved as much, they had more
-P-A-G-E-183
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 165 
ammunition there, and the North knew that it would be 
an advantage to capture Georgia. 
Teacher. I want to know how they were going to get to 
Georgia? Were they there at Vicksburg? 
Class. Yes. 
Teacher. Margaret. 
Margaret. They could go down by the Gulf of Mexico. 
Teacher. That would mean a large fleet down there to trans- 
port all of our soldiers. I don’t think that would be very 
practical, do you? Mary, how are you going to get to 
Georgia. Suppose you were a commander, how would you 
lead them? : 
Mary. I would go over the mountains. 
Teacher. Where are the mountains? 
Mary. In Tennessee. 
Teacher. All right. You would move up to Tennessee. What 
would be the advantage of moving up to Tennessee? You 
must remember your soldiers have to be fed. Russell, 
you tell us. 
Russell. They would have more food, as the crops are good 
there. 
Teacher. What do we say? Near the source of ... ? 
Class. Supply. 
Teacher. You remember at the time of the Armistice Ger- 
many’s supplies were cut off, so you see there was nothing 
else to do but declare an armistice. The thing for every 
army to do was to keep near the source of supply. 
Another advantage, Joseph. 
Joseph. The South had taken refuge in these mountains, and 
they would conquer them there. 
Teacher. If they did this they would have the South sur- 
rounded on how many sides? 
Class. Three sides. 
Teacher. How had they surrounded the South on the east 
side? 
Class. By the blockade. 
Teacher. How do we know they went through Tennessee? 
Class. By the battles. 
Teacher. What are some of the battles fought around Ten- 
nessee? Vernon. 
Vernon. Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Lookout Mountain.
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. All right, Tennessee was taken, and then they moved 
down through what? Cameron. 
Cameron. Georgia. 
Teacher. What other advantage was there in moving down 
there besides the ammunition? Russell. 
Russell. They’ll have all those states cut off by themselves. 
Teacher. So they cannot send supplies to what? What city 
did they want to shut off, Dorothy? 
Dorothy. Richmond. 
Teacher. You see if they come down to Georgia they can’t 
secure supplies. Where was Lee? 
Class. Richmond. 
Teacher. From Tennessee through Georgia was the nearest 
cut to the sea. Was Grant up there? 
Class. Yes. 
Teacher. What was Grant trying to do? [Class cannot 
answer.] Close in. Close in, shut off Lee’s supplies. All 
right. Books aside. To-morrow we are going on with 
the eastern battles. Just trace them. Try to get through 
the last two years of the war. 
9. Comments: This recitation occupied thirty minutes. The 
children were eager throughout. The responses were well 
distributed. Practically all of the pupils seemed to follow 
the work intelligently. 
A Critical Study of the Supervisor’s Evaluation of the 
Lesson 
One supervisor gave the following evaluation: 
The teacher’s purpose was realized to the extent that problem 
solution was her aim. 
Good use of maps and supplementary material. 
Careful encouragement of pupil participation. 
Provision for habit of suspended judgment. 
The supervisor would make the following suggestions 
to this teacher: 
Study good questions, aiming to question so as to produce 
reaction on the part of the children, thus leading to questions 
and active thinking from the children.
-P-A-G-E-185
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 167 
It is evident that this supervisor sees a weakness in the 
lesson. Probably there are other weaknesses more funda- 
mental. Will the suggestions made produce the desired 
change in the teacher’s methods of teaching? Would such 
suggestions stimulate the teacher to go to the supervisor of 
her own accord for specific assistance with concrete situa- 
tions? 
Another supervisor makes the following suggestions to 
the teacher: 
You do too much talking. Ask questions so pupils must think 
the answers, and not be able to guess them as was done in 
several instances, such as “They were not only set free but sent 
on their way to... 2? Class?” Class answers, “Hngland”; 
and “Near the source of ... ?” Class answers, “Supply.” I 
would suggest that the class take some of the lead. They were 
helped constantly by you. They asked no questions themselves. 
Check up more definitely at the close of the period. 
This supervisor, too, sees a weakness of this lesson. 
Furthermore, she has made three specific suggestions 
based upon concrete evidence. There seems, however, to 
be no definite plan in mind for the evaluation of a recita- 
tion. Her suggestions were about things on the surface. 
The teacher might follow all of these suggestions and still 
fail in the teaching of history. A more vital considera- 
tion is, Did the teacher’s questions lead the class to see 
relationships, and to organize data about these sequences? 
A third supervisor evaluated this lesson thus: 
Since there was no aim by which this lesson could -be unified, 
the method, organization, and accomplishment are poor. The 
teacher showed vivacity and general good management in the 
externals of the situation. 
Her remedial suggestions were as follows: 
Decide upon what is possible for eighth-grade pupils to accom- 
plish along lines of leadership, service, mastery of story of
-P-A-G-E-186
    168 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
country’s development. Plan lesson around an immediate aim 
for the particular day which harmonizes with the large aim of: 
the course. Make method further this particular aim. Let 
pupils discuss the material chosen and then make their own 
outline, and let them propose topics for further study. Allow 
pupils more opportunity to do their own thinking and judging 
until they are able to take the initiative in a discussion. 
This supervisor has doubtless hit upon a fundamental 
weakness. But will the teacher understand her sugges- 
tions? The teacher would probably like to say, ‘‘But how 
am I to do all of these things? Will you come and work 
it out with me concretely in this particular case?’’ Con- 
sidering the actual performance of the teacher, how well 
fitted is she to rise unaided to the level of teaching im- 
plied in the supervisor’s suggestions? One of the com- 
mon failings among supervisors is that their suggestions 
are not accompanied by concrete applications. The 
teacher is bewildered and discouraged, and knows that 
something is wrong, but not how to correct it. 
Another supervisor commented as follows: 
Good points: Enthusiasm, attempt at comparison, reaching 
for cause and effect. Her purpose was to test the pupils’ knowl- 
edge of assignment, and in this she was fairly successful. 
Adverse Features: or eighth-grade pupils who had practi- 
eally a year of United States history, this type of lesson was a 
sheer waste of time—almost a total loss. Teacher too much in 
the foreground also. Poor technique of questioning. 
Remedial Suggestions: Can you think of one problem you 
might have set up for the class that would require all this body 
of information to answer? ‘The teacher should then be led to 
see that using material is a better drill than merely repeating it. 
This supervisor has grasped the main issues of the les- 
son. She sees its strong and weak features, but has not 
helped the teacher. Sweeping statements will wound the 
teachers, and condemnations will sting without stimulat- 
ing. Has the supervisor so analyzed the recitation that  
-P-A-G-E-187
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 169 
the teacher will grow in the technique of analyzing her 
own recitations, and thereby grow in power to improve 
her own methods when the supervisor is not present? 
Has the supervisor so stimulated the teacher that she will 
grow in professional zeal and the desire to become a real 
artist in the classroom? 
Another supervisor has approached the lesson from a 
somewhat different angle. The complete analysis of this 
supervisor is given: 
A. Analysis of Recitation 
I. Physical Conditions for Learning 
(a) Light: OK 
(b) Temperature: OK-Favorable 
(c) Seating: Favorable 
(d) Working tools: Varied texts; maps (partly 
sufficient) 
(e) Pupils: Normal except two exceptionally good 
at memory work 
II. Immediate Conditions for Learning 
(a) New material 
1. Study recitation 
2. Problem to be solved 
3. Project 
4. Questions to be answered 
(b) Material previously studied 
1. Testing for mastery of textual material: by 
question and answer and discussion 
2. Practice or drill 
B. Evaluation of Procedure 
I. The Material and Tools (Teacher) 
(a) Method used: Assignment known to pupils— 
expected to have answers ready 
(b) Accuracy of manipulation of tools: Skillful, 
except when map of Europe was not produced 
(c) Organization of material: By outline, chrono- 
logically, and around two questions 
(d) Motivation: Keen, by having specific questions 
and varied sources 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    170 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
(e) Fertility of suggestion: I should say fairly 
fertile 
(f) Quality of English used: Good 
II. Accomplishment (Pupil) 
(a) Interest shown: Better than average 
(b) Initiative displayed: Marked, by some pupils 
(c) Organization of materials: Teacher did it 
(d) Mastery of assignment: Very fine by some; 
fair by remainder from memory viewpoint 
(e) Quality of English used: Fair 
C. Summary (Here give a brief evaluation of the recitation. 
Was the purpose of the teacher realized?) 
I. This is a strong lesson in three respects: 
(a) A definite assignment was given. 
4b) Sources were available for data. 
(c) Location was employed to give reality to the 
history work. 
IL. The lesson could have been improved in four respects: 
(a) The teacher’s questions were not prepared in 
advance, and called forth scrappy answers. 
(b) The lesson wandered far afield from the plan. 
(c) The teacher did the organizing and raised too 
many of the issues. 
(d) The whole exercise was on the same level. Non- 
essentials were given the same importance as 
vital issues. 
D. Remedial Suggestions which you as a supervisor would make 
to this teacher. 
Supervisor. I wish to compliment you on three features of 
your lesson. [Gave them as above.] Has it raised any 
questions in your mind? 
Teacher. How can I keep this class to the theme of the lesson, 
and yet let them raise questions, which is one of the most 
important elements in good thinking. [This question was 
sent in by this teacher in the hope that some supervisor 
would answer it.] 
Supervisor. You have hit upon one of the problems I wish 
to talk over with you. That discussion of international 
law, while interesting, was unfortunate just here, because 
of the lack of information regarding the two conditions
-P-A-G-E-189
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 171 
which were not entirely parallel, and which led to a con- 
fusion of issues. I think the trouble lies in a feature that 
you can remedy. 
You have a definite outline for your pupils to follow 
in their study. You had a right to expect them to be able 
to discuss those topics, but you need to have ready always 
some more analytical questions that will stimulate thought 
beyond the textbook. These can be given after the 
assignment has been covered, or along with it, depending 
upon the nature of each. Such questions—4 and 5— 
should always involve the main issues of the lesson, and 
serve to aid the pupil more completely to organize the 
data furnished in the subject matter. These must be made 
thoughtfully in advance, and they practically comprise 
your lesson plan for the discussion period. By having 
had these you could have kept your discussion on one or 
two main centers. It would not have gone ahead of the 
assignment prepared by the majority of the class, as it 
did, thus falling into the hands of a few leaders. The 
questions raised by them, if off these main topics, could 
always be referred to a committee; or the individual asked 
to look them up and give the answer to the class, thus 
providing for independent thinking. 
Here are the supplementary questions I should have 
used in this lesson, because your assignment in the main 
called for gathering of data only. 
1. Let us picture the situation on our map at the time 
of the beginning of to-day’s lesson. Books are open, and 
each pupil is finding places and making a contribution, 
using perhaps white and orange chalk for north and south 
locations respectively. 
Let us see what this would have covered in your lesson 
assignment. Practically all the location work, classified 
as to north and south. Then you could call for the first 
question on the board: Why did Grant want to capture 
New Orleans? I believe you would have secured a more 
intelligent answer than you did. Meantime, do you not 
think a large number of questions would have been raised 
by the pupils regarding points which they had the data 
at hand to settle? 
2. “Why do rivers play so important a part in wars,”  
-P-A-G-E-190
172 
  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
and “Give examples,” are very appropriate questions, here, 
I think, but only after data are supplied. Do you see the 
reason for this? 
3. “Who can defend the position the North took in the 
Trent affair?” 
4, “Who will defend Lincoln’s position?” 
You will note that these questions keep discussion be- 
tween class members, and not between you and a class 
member. 
5. Make the changes in our class map caused by the 
events discussed in to-day’s work, thus bringing out big 
movements, and throwing details into proper perspective. 
6. Indicate what you think will happen next. Give this 
as a lead into the next day’s assignment. 
If you will try for a time putting your thoughts into 
a few well-formulated questions, you can tie together 
great historical movements, thus utilizing the detailed 
study by the pupils and strengthening their organization 
of data. You will find, I think, that most of the teaching 
problems you are meeting have disappeared. 
As soon as you have formulated your questions for a 
given lesson, with the pupils’ texts at hand, decide which 
ones are plainly answered by the data in the book. These 
can be used as the basis for the assignment which you will 
expect each pupil to prepare. Other questions will be 
suggested by the text materials. Often, several of these 
ean be unified into one or two problem questions with 
minor questions about each. The remaining questions 
that you have prepared will constitute your supplementary 
questions to be asked at the close of the discussion period 
or within it, according to their nature. The data for these 
questions must either be found in the tests, be given by 
the teacher or in a special report by a pupil, or be an 
outgrowth of the class discussion on related topics. 
By holding your class to the main lesson topies, by 
allowing their questions to be discussed in proportion to 
their common interest and real worth, and by setting goals 
of accomplishment so that each pupil feels the responsi- 
bility for completing the units of work on time, you should 
be able to utilize the fine class spirit you have secured to 
bring about a high standard of accomplishment in history.

Teacher. I see where I have been at fault. I have not put 
my time on planning vital features of my lesson. I have 
neglected the elements of good thinking. I know I can 
improve and.I will. [This response was secured from the 
teacher upon receipt of this analysis. ] 
A worthy analysis. It is evident that this supervisor 
had in mind a large number of the standards for the im- 
provement of teaching. He realized the importance of 
securing the teacher’s codperation, of getting the teacher 
to analyze her problem, and of making the conference 
forward-looking by giving the teacher a definite method 
for lesson-planning which solved this teacher’s major 
difficulty.   
      
A Spetiine Lesson, Grape 2 
1. Kind of school: City school in a community in which there 
are children from homes varying greatly in opportunity. 
2. Teacher: High-school and state-normal-school graduate with 
some university training in art. She has had four years of 
experience in teaching rural and graded schools, with one 
year of experience in primary work. Happy, stimulating, 
skillful in managing children, and seems to make every 
moment count. 
3. Learning conditions: A desirable room with seats well 
adjusted and lighting and temperature up to standard. 
The blackboards were attractively covered with work which 
was used in the recitation, and which was at the same time 
combined with well-executed drawings. The children were 
perfectly natural, free to sit or stand at will, but were 
controlled and took no undue liberties. They had just come 
in from a play period. 
4, Class activity: An advance lesson in spelling taken from the 
city list for the grade. 
5. Children: There were twenty-one pupils ranging in ages 
from seven to eight and a half years. None of them seemed 
to be below par mentally, though some of them were not in 
good physical condition. A few appeared undernourished. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The class had followed 
the work for Grade II as given in the Horn-Ashbaugh

Spelling Book (Lippincott), and had been given in addition 
the local list including the names of the streets, city build- 
ings, ete. Some words which the children had used in written 
composition and had misspelled were also used. The lesson 
reported was an advance lesson containing also a list of 
review words. 
7. Materials used: Blackboard; list of words; teacher’s plan 
book. 
8. The lesson: The teacher steps in front of the children and 
speaks in a stimulating way. 
Teacher. Now, children, take out pencil and paper. [Done 
at once.] Put pencils down and fold hands. I want you 
to think this afternoon about how these words sound. 
They sound like old friends some of them. They are new 
words I have never given you in spelling before. The first 
new word is br-ight [speaking it slowly and distinetly]. 
‘When you think you can spell it, raise your hand. [About 
twelve hands raised.] Walter. 
Walter. L-i-g-h-t. 
Teacher, That’s the old word. That’s light, Walter. Now 
spell br-ight. It’s just like light, except the first is 
different.

After each word she asks the children to think of its 
meaning.] Now, children, you may choose your partners 
for the test on these words. Be sure you know every 
word when I call time. 
9. Comment: Following the presentation given above, which 
occupied fifteen minutes, the pupils were allowed a similar 
period for group study. Forming in pairs the pupils die- 
tated the list of words. These they had copied on their 
papers while the lesson was in progress. The papers were 
taken to the teacher for correction, and the standings 
entered into the pupils’ individual record books (made in 
drawing class). Those children failing to get 100 per cent 
returned for further study. Every Friday a test was given 
on the work for the previous four days. This test was 
often a short dictation exercise involving review words. An 
accurate record of each individual’s misspelled words for 
diagnostic work was not incorporated in the spelling pro- 
gram except as stated above.

A Critical Study of the Supervisors’ Evaluation of 
This Lesson 
In the evaluation of this recitation by supervisors, 
fifteen specific features were either commended or ques- 
tioned by various individuals. It is interesting to test the 
validity of these statements by the principles of teaching 
spelling derived from scientific investigation. The sum- 
maries of their evaluations are given below, followed by 
statements of accepted principles of teaching taken from 
reliable sources. 
1. One supervisor, in her effort to help the teacher, 
emphasized the following point: ‘‘The new words should 
be presented in the ‘order of diffieulty.”’ 
It appears quite evident from a study of this recitation that 
the words bright and bringing presented less difficulty to the 
pupils than did buy and close. In both cases there was a familiar 
phonie element, and in the latter word an additional familiar 
syllable. The word buy was difficult because it was confused with 
its homonyms, by and bye. Close presented a pronunciation 
difficulty. It was confused with other words somewhat similar in 
form, but wholly different in meaning. 
Horn states, as one of the principles of word gradation, that 
those words that are most difficult should be presented in the 
more advanced grades." Nothing is said about carrying such 
gradation into any given day’s assignment. Such a gradation is 
no doubt sound psychologically, though of minor importance. 
2. Another said, ‘‘The teacher separated the words 
into syllables.’’ 
This is a sound psychological principle. Tidyman, in giving 
the successive steps of presentation, includes the visual and 
auditory presentation of the word in syllables, and the pro- 
nunciation of the word by syllables with a clear visual analysis 
of the letters of the syllables. However, there is a danger in 
separating the syllables to a marked degree in presenting the

178 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
word visually. Such a procedure is apt to alter the appearance 
of the word so that it is not recognized when presented in com- 
pact form. 
3. The use of the words in sentences was commended 
by another supervisor. 
Tidyman says that the use of words in sentences is important 
as emphasizing the practical utility of spelling, and as giving 
the child opportunity for practice.’ This is often expensive of 
time. If words are properly graded most of them will be 
familiar to the pupils. Some words should be presented in 
sentences in order to avoid confusion with homonyms and words 
somewhat similar in sound. In this lesson it was a waste of time 
to use the word bringing in a sentence whereas it was justifiable 
to present buy and close in this way. 
4, The successful phonetic emphasis in the presenta- 
tion of words was commended by some of the supervisors. 
This, also, is questionable. Experimentation has shown that 
children who learn to read by a phonic method seem to have no 
advantages in learning to spell. Horn states that, in general, 
one seems justified for administrative and other reasons in say- 
ing that the time of both pupils and teacher will be conserved 
by regarding each word as an individual problem. Any advan- 
tage on initial letters and vowels gained from phonics seems 
offset by tendencies to leave out silent letters and insert letters. 
On the other hand, Tidyman® says that the study of phonics 
directly aids the learning of spelling by giving a knowledge of 
the sound value of letters; by developing clear articulation and 
accurate enunciation; by correcting inaccuracies of speech; by 
strengthening the association between the common speech sounds 
and their literal equivalents; and by calling attention to the com- 
mon elements of words. However, he believes that a common 
mistake in spelling is in carrying the phonetic analysis of words 
too far. 
5. ‘‘The lesson is a combination of pre-test and pho- 
netic study plan,’’ said another.

*Ibid., p. 63.

COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 179 
It seems evident to-day that the pupils’ ability to spell all 
words should be tested before teaching. Pupils should not spend 
time working on words that they can already spell. Teaching 
each child all of the words in a spelling lesson involves a great 
waste of time. An experiment carried on by Horn and Ritter 
shows over 75 per cent waste of time would have resulted from 
teaching each child every word in the lesson. Horn concludes 
that better provision should be made to insure that each child 
work on his own special difficulties and on no other® 
A study of this lesson shows that there is no evidence that any 
pre-testing is given as a basis for selecting the words to be 
taught. Each word is taught to the entire group. 
6. ‘‘Too much oral spelling is permitted,’’ is the ver- 
dict of one supervisor. 
Whereas oral spelling is of value in providing new modes of 
- imaging and means of expression, visual presentation is superior 
to auditory presentation, and should precede it.’ Also, spelling 
should make free use of words in writing in as much as spelling 
is used only in writing situations. 
7. ‘Social instinct was used by permitting children 
to study in pairs,’? commended another analyst. 
8. ‘There was too little supervision and direction of 
study habits. The teacher marked the papers while the 
groups studied and tested,’’ said another. 
There is a possible value in making use of the partnership 
activity in testing. The value of this was greatly decreased, 
however, by having each group drill on the same list of words. 
Through testing in pairs the teacher should have provided each 
pupil with an opportunity for drilling upon only those words 
missed by him. This was not done. 
9. ‘‘The teacher did not supervise the study of the 
children at their seats.’’ Pupils when left to themselves 
are likely to use methods of study less economical than

    180 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
those directed by the teacher. Most children have not 
been taught methods of learning to spell. It is very 
important that they become habituated to correct meth- 
ods of study. Repeating the letters of a word over and 
over is no guaranty that the word sigs be learned cor- 
rectly. 
10. ‘‘The interest of the children was keen,’’ said sev- 
eral. ‘‘There was a maximum of pupil activity,’’ com- 
mented another. 
These are important. Keen interest and close attention are 
necessary in habit formation. There was probably too much 
pupil activity in this lesson. In most work a high degree of 
pupil activity is commendable. It must, however, be directed 
into paths of learning economical of time and effort. 
11. ‘‘There was no evidence of individual growth,’’ 
observed one. 
12. ‘‘Individual record books enabled children to keep 
a check on their own progress,’’ said several. 
One of the very best methods of focusing attention in acquir- 
ing any skill is to chart the progress made. Individual records, 
particularly when they are related to individual progress, 
strengthen the purpose to improve by making visible both goal 
and progress in attaining the goal. 
13. ‘‘No special help was given to poor spellers,’’ re- 
marked several. 
The three previous statements are manifestly contradictory, 
and represent the usual extremes of judgment exhibited by a 
group of supervisors concerning a piece of work. There is a bit 
of truth, however, in each statement. No special help was given 
to individuals except the unsupervised activities of the pairs. 
There is evidence of individual growth recorded in the spelling 
books kept by the pupils. These lists of misspelled words should 
be the basis for vigorous reviews, but, at the same time, more 
attention should be given to the study habits of the children. 
*The Eighteenth Yearbook, Part II, p. 60.
-P-A-G-E-199
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 181 
14. ‘‘The children were learning to think and con- 
sider before coming to a conclusion,’’ stated one. 
15. ‘‘The previous knowledge of the children was util- 
ized and organized,’’ remarked another. 
Children learned to classify the words according to their diffi- 
culties, to pick out familiar, unfamiliar, and difficult parts of 
words, and to associate these parts with similar parts of other 
words. But this was done, on the whole, in an uneconomical 
way. 
The fifteen extracts evaluating this lesson show how 
hazy are the ideas of many supervisors concerning the 
teaching of spelling. This teacher had thought over her 
problem, and had formulated a method. Supervisors, in 
order to improve the teacher’s work, must know the whole 
field of spelling, must be able to analyze the lesson accu- 
rately, and show the teacher wherein the lesson is uneco- 
nomical, and how to make her methods harmonize with 
the laws of learning. One supervisor did this in the fol- 
lowing way: 
There are some respects in which I believe you can save time 
and also improve results. 
1. You are really giving thirty minutes a day to spelling, when 
it is generally accepted that fifteen minutes is sufficient. Suppose 
you tested on Tuesday, because one person might as well dictate 
for a whole class; or by pairing the testing can be worked out 
individually. Is that not true? Then, you could score the papers 
and check on the original list every time a word was missed. 
This would furnish you with a relative difficulty chart for the 
week’s work. On Wednesday suppose you taught the first half 
of the misspelled words to the group who missed any of them, 
teaching them how to associate parts of words, how to image 
words, and, in short, how to study spelling. You are more con- 
cerned with the building of economical habits of learning how to 
spell any word than you are with learning this individual list 
—are you not? No one who does not understand the laws of 
learning can teach a child how to spell. Children cannot do this 
for each other. They can only test. Pupils who secured 100 per-
-P-A-G-E-200
182 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
cent on the test could drill each other very profitably on previously 
missed words. On Thursday teach the other half of the mis- 
spelled words, using approved methods of teaching them. (See 
textbook and Highteenth Yearbook, Part II.) On Friday test 
your entire class by the dictation method if you like this. This 
is very acceptable. This plan will leave Monday free for review 
as you now have it. 
2. You associated words alike phonetically in developing the 
new lesson. In the cases of buy and close this caused confusion. 
Scientific studies have revealed that our language contains so 
many exceptions to phonetic spelling that it is not always 
economical so to present them. Present the correct form of the 
word to the child as he is to visualize it, and then ask for review 
words with similar parts, if you so desire. Appeal to form 
rather than to sound. 
3. Have pupils keep for review a list of misspelled words 
taught to them a second time. Your relative difficulty chart will 
indicate the proper amount of time for each word. Do you see 
the advantage of this plan? 
4, I note that the children were tested in writing according to 
your plan, but study orally. 
We have reason now to believe that saying over the letters does 
not help the child to write words better. 
Should you not teach your pupils how to study by themselves? 
Do you think they would be helped by directions like the fol- 
lowing placed on the board or in a notebook? 
. Look at the word. 
. Pronounce every syllable slowly. 
. Look away or close your eyes. Try to see it. 
. Write the word. Check. 
Do this several times, if you missed it. 
. Test yourself on entire list, writing them after just 
peeping at them. 
7. Check carefully. Study again, if needed. 
5. I believe you can preserve the fine group spirit you have, 
continue the development of initiative, and save time by a 
procedure like the following: 
Stressing economy of time. 
Learning how to learn how to spell. 
Obtaining visual images in most approved ways. 
Giving relatively more time to hard words. Og pepe

An EneuisH Lesson, Grape 8B 
1. Kind of school: An American community above the average 
in general culture. 
2. Teacher: High-school, normal-school, and university gradu- 
ate. She has had one year of experience in intermediate 
grades, four years in high school, and one year in her 
present position. She is a quiet, skillful organizer, clear in 
presentation, especially gifted in securing individual re- 
sponsibility on the part of pupils. 
8. Learning conditions: A portable building, fairly well lighted, 
but dingy and unprepossessing in appearance. Slate boards, 
adjustable seats, and physical conditions made as favorable 
as possible with a jacketed stove for heating. 
4, Class activity: Differentiated work to meet special needs of 
pupils who had completed the course of study for the year. 
Several needed more work in certain topics. One group 
was preparing a play, several were engaged in group read- 
ing, some in individual reading, and the remainder were to 
receive help from the teacher in classifying clauses. 
5. Children: Twenty-four children were in the class. All but 
five were normal or better than normal. The remainder 
were over age, and English was a rather difficult subject 
for them. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The year’s work had 
consisted of a general language course involving reading, 
oral and written composition, grammar, and a little work 
in dramatics. To meet the needs of individuals and different 
groups the following activities had been provided: 
Dramatization: Several short plays suitable for Memorial Day 
were given to a group of six children who were to read them, 
and choose the most appropriate. They chose ‘‘A Homesteader’s 
Christmas’’ from Citizenship Plays by Hubbard. They chose 
their leader to direct the play, and had been at work for a week. 
Group Reading: Some of the pupils were found to be weak in 
the interpretation. One pupil, a little stronger than the others, 
was chosen from each group to lead. One group was reading a 
Story of Aladdin and of Ali Baba. Another was reading Moni, 
the Goat Boy. 
Individual Reading: A few individuals were reading independ- 
ently. One had The Golden Touch and another The Story of 
Robert E. Lee (chosen on basis of interest). 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  184 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Class Work: About ten pupils were to remain in the room for 
special help in grammar. 
In order to keep in touch with the work of the various 
groups, the teacher required weekly reports of the pupils. 
These were similar to the time sheet used in business, and 
stated the assignment for each day, what had been done in 
preparation, and what was accomplished during the class 
period. In all cases the teacher relied upon the integrity 
of the pupils to make out an honest report. 
7. Materials used: Miscellaneous books of varied nature such 
as the Instructor Literature Series (F. A. Owen Publishing 
Co.), single copies of library books, complete sets of classics, 
a variety of English texts, and a good deal of project work 
that involved general reading had been utilized to form the 
basis for this practical course in English. 
8. The lesson: The class comes in promptly, and the teacher 
indicates that there is to be a general discussion before the 
group work begins. 
Teacher. The first thing we shall do to-day is to listen to a 
report from the director of the play that our class is going 
to give. We must remember that the director will need 
help from the rest of us. We will see what he wants the 
rest of us to do. 
Donald. The name of our play is “The Homesteader’s Christ- 
mas.” One would think from the title that it was not 
appropriate to give at this time, but since this is the 
seventy-fifth anniversary of the state of Wisconsin we 
thought it would be nice to give something about its early 
history. The characters are: Bob, Robert, Florence, 
Edmund, and William [names of pupils who are taking 
the parts]. I don’t need any help just now but I will 
announce later when we need help. Monday morning we 
will give it before our class, and if there are any 
criticisms then we would like to have them given so 
that it would help the play. [This is given in a self- 
possessed manner, in a pleasing voice, and with consider- 
able dignity.] 
Teacher. Now the play group may go outside for rehearsal. 
[Pupils pass out quietly and practice under a shade tree, 
handing their English reports for the week to the teacher

as they pass her.] What other group leader is ready? 
[Joseph volunteers, and gives in a direct way, using good 
English, a four-minute report of the chapter they have 
been reading from Aladdin.] That was very well done, 
Joseph. [The teacher then asks two or three questions 
on the content of the story, asking other members of the 
group to give specific bits of information regarding the 
setting and the nature of the story.] Elizabeth, I would 
like to have a report from you on what you have been 
reading by yourself—one you would like to report on. 
[Elizabeth did not care much for reading when the term 
began. Now she gives a spirited report portraying the 
miser in The Golden Touch.] Now we have had fairy 
tales. Tell us what you like about the story of Robert E. 
Lee, George. 
George. The story starts out where his father died. He gave 
up everything to stay with his mother. When he grew 
up he went to Harvard and received very good training. 
He graduated with the highest honors from his class. 
Later he went to West Point and received high honors 
there. Finally, the Mexican War broke out. He was very 
famous as a scout. One time he got too near the Mexican 
line and was nearly killed. Then he fought in the Civil 
War. 
Teacher. Is there anything in particular about this man that 
you liked? 
George. One thing I liked was his character. He had feeling 
for all of his men. He wasn’t stuck up, he didn’t make 
them do things that seemed impossible. He always planned 
his things and consulted his generals under him, and before 
he set out on any expedition he asked if they thought it 
‘was wise. 
Teacher. Sarah, you may tell us about Moni, the Goat Boy. 
[Sarah begins a report but is stopped by the teacher after 
she demonstrates that she understands the story.] Now 
you who are reading may take your classics and go out- 
side of the building. Continue your reading and be ready 
with your reports. [These children settle themselves 
comfortably on the lawn, and in less than two minutes 
are working as hard as ever children did under a teacher.] 
The rest of us will discuss clauses. [Ten pupils are left

We say it does the work of an adverb, Robert. Then what 
does it modify?

[Teacher leaves the room to look after the groups in, 
the yard, and the pupils work industriously and inde- 
pendently while she is absent.] 
9, Comments: The period lasted forty-five minutes. During this 
time each of the groups had been profitably employed. At 
the first gong they came promptly to the classroom, handed 
in their materials, and waited in order for dismissal. The 
teacher stated that she would have their reports checked 
and ready for them on Monday. 
A Critical Study of the Supervisors’ Evaluation of 
This Lesson 
The reactions of supervisors to this recitation may be 
divided into three classes: 
1. Those who recognized a superior piece of work, but 
felt no urge to direct the activity of this teacher to higher 
levels of teaching. 
2. Those who recognized a superior piece of work but 
felt it incumbent upon them to make some criticisms.
-P-A-G-E-206

188 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
8. Those who really expressed keen appreciation of 
the outstanding high points, and at the same time gave 
constructive suggestions for improving less favorable 
features of the recitation—suggestions that would result 
in more efficient work on the part of the teacher, and 
at the same time spur her on to wider investigation and 
experimentation with the possibilities of group work. 
A report of the first type is given below. The super- 
visor has nothing to suggest except that he might do 
something to improve the physical conditions for learn- 
ing.

©. Summary (Here give a brief evaluation of the recitation. 
Was the purpose of the teacher realized?) 
I consider this an ideal recitation. The teacher’s method of 
grouping the pupils so that all pupils could be engaged in 
profitable activity was excellent. This was due to her organiza- 
tion of material, motivation, and fertility of suggestion. The 
interest shown by pupils and the mastery of the assignment show 
that the teacher realized her purpose. 
D. Remedial Suggestions which you, as a supervisor, would 
make to this teacher: The supervisor in this case could work 
on the improvement of physical conditions for learning. 
The second evaluation which is presented below goes 
a step further. A suggestion is made that all members 
of a group should be permitted to report. The teacher 
is criticised for not permitting Sarah to complete her 
book report. The formal grammar work is criticised as 
lifeless and abstract. No suggestions are given to make 
the work interesting, concrete, and purposeful.

C. Summary (Here give a brief evaluation of the recitation. 
Was the purpose of the teacher realized?) 
“The teacher’s purposes were several, and were, I believe, 
realized to a high degree. The group who were dramatizing 
showed progress as did the groups in reading and the individuals 
reading independently. The drill lesson in grammar showed that 
the purpose of teaching knowledge of adjective and adverbial 
clauses was fairly well realized.” 
D. Remedial Suggestions which a supervisor would make to this 
teacher. 
“Group leaders were called on for reports, and they gave well-
-P-A-G-E-209
        COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 
connected discourses on their progress. This privilege should 
extend to all members of the group, that all may get the advan- 
tages accruing from responsibility. Sarah’s report on Moni, the 
Goat Boy, should not have been stopped.” 191            
In the following evaluation the supervisor goes a step 
further and not only makes suggestions leading to a 
refinement of procedure on the part of the teacher, but 
suggests new ‘‘leads,’’? such as, having the children re- 
write stories for younger children, each pupil preparing 
a chapter, ete. This is made purposeful by the suggestion 
that these pupils may present their chapters at the open- 
ing exercises in some lower-grade room.

€. Summary (Here give a brief evaluation of the recitation. 
‘Was the purpose of the teacher realized?) 
“The teacher’s purposes were several, and were, I believe, 
realized. A superior piece of work showing keen insight on the 
part of the teacher, unusual amount of pupil responsibility, and 
a checking-up of definite accomplishment that would satisfy the 
most formal standards. The teacher’s method of grouping the 
pupils so that all could be engaged in profitable activity was 
excellent.” 
This type of work is to be highly commended in the 
hands of an exceptional leader. Even then it must be 
guided constantly, as this teacher evidently does success- 
fully. : 
Some of the group activities were rather loosely organ- 
ized, however. Loose work might be questioned, coming 
at the end of the school year as it does. 
D. Remedial Suggestions which a supervisor would make to the 
teacher. 
After commending this fine piece of teaching, the supervisor 
raised the following questions: 
1. Does the timid child get his chance? 
2. Can you give sufficient supervision of the reading group to 
determine their ability to comprehend, rate, lip reading, ete.? 
3. How long are the pupils in the different groups?             
  
-P-A-G-E-211
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 193 
4, How do you arrange it when one or more of the pupils need 
the help of the work of other groups besides the one in which 
he or they are working? 
5. How is the assignment made? 
6. Does the interest of the pupils “carry over” a whole week in 
the matter of their weekly reports? 
7. Would it not be better, perhaps, to get their reports checked 
and returned more quickly? 
8. Evidently you make a broad assignment, and allow the 
children to make divisions of that into days. How does this 
work? Do you find that pupils have correct methods for their 
procedure? 
The following suggestions were given: 
1. A great advantage is gained by having groups of from 
four to six. 
2. Some definite group use should be made of the reading, 
such as, a codperative telling of the story at the end for the class 
as a whole, or an improvised dramatization. It might be better 
to form not more than three groups, and have for each a grip- 
ping problem of as much importance as was the play. Children 
may rewrite the stories for younger children, each preparing a 
chapter, thus securing both reading and composition practice. 
They may then take part in the opening exercises of some lower- 
grade room, telling or reading the stories they have written. 
Individual needs can still be met by providing practice reading 
with questions for spare-time and home-work problems. 
II. Propuems AND EXERCISES IN THE CRITICAL 
EvauvaTions or TEACHING 
In the preceding section of this chapter several evalu- 
ations of teaching were critically analyzed. It will be 
the purpose of this section to reproduce a number of 
concrete teaching situations as practice exercises for the 
prospective supervisor in the evaluation of teaching. 
Before attempting to analyze these lessons, review the 
critical studies of teaching in this and the preceding 
chapter. Also reread the standards for teaching on 
pages 22-23. Keep in mind three major steps: (1) the  
-P-A-G-E-212
194 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
analysis of the recitation; (2) evaluation of the proce- 
dure; and (3) remedial suggestions which you as super- 
visor would make to the teacher. 
  An Arrrumetic Lesson, Grape 3A: 
1. Kind of school: A small, graded school in a section of city 
drawing pupils from the middle classes. A few of the 
children were transients. 
2. Teacher: A high-school and normal-school graduate. Has 
an even, pleasant voice; is quiet, but firm and sympathetic. 
She keeps up an even distribution of effort; she stimulates 
but does not force. 
3. Learning conditions: LEarly-morning period, comfortable 
room, seats well adjusted to physical needs of pupils. 
Boards plainly seen. No distraction in the room, as the 
pupils in the other section were busily at work. Atmosphere 
especially favorable for nervous pupils. 
4, Class activity: Test on previous work in combinations and 
advance work on problems without numbers. 
5. Children: Twelve pupils; all normal but one, who was ten 
years of age and undernourished. The remainder of chil- 
dren were seven and eight years of age. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The class had prac- 
tically two years of arithmetic including work in com- 
binations, number, sense-training, simple problems, and 
considerable written work in abstract arithmetic extending 
as far as multiplication table of 9’s. The immediate work 
preceding had been practice work with the Courtis Practice 
Tests, followed by special drill on combinations believed to 
be especially difficult according to a recent unpublished 
scientifie study. No special study had been given the 
material tested in preparation for the day’s work. It was 
to be used as a basis for individual study by pupils who 
failed in any of the combinations. 
7. Materials used: Blackboard; Wentworrs-Smira School 
Arithmetics, Book I. F. L. Cuapr, Tentative Study of the 
Relative Difficulty of Arithmetic Facts had been looked 
over by the teacher before giving the lesson. 
8. The lesson: While the teacher is giving directions to the 
other section in the room, she asks Marie and Maryls to
-P-A-G-E-213
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 195 
choose teams for the arithmetic contest. These pupils pass 
to the front of the room and call names alternately. Soon 
the children are standing in straight rows behind their 
leaders. As soon as the teacher is ready she indicates that 
they are to return to their seats and sit up with their pencils 
ready. Papers are passed quickly, and the following direc- 
tions are given: 
Teacher. Put the name of your captain at the head of your 
paper so when you exchange papers no one of your team 
will have your paper to correct. [Teacher writes Maryls 
and Marie on board.] Ready! Write what I give you, 
and put down the answer. [The teacher dictates the facts, 
using no notes, at the rate of six to the minute, always 
waiting until the children seem ready for the next one.] 
Ox 8; 7x6: 420515 1;9x4;7 x 9;:35-—75 845 
9x0; 5x6; 7x8; 15—6; 9 and 7; 8 and 4; 16—9; 
5x12; 42—7; 64—8. 
Now, attention. Let’s see your fingers. Lay your 
pencils down. Stretch them out. Pencils up. 56—8; 
14—5; 1—1. Those who are in Marie’s team stand. 
Hand your papers to some one in the other team. Ready, 
sit. Those in the other team hand papers to some one in 
Maryls’s team. [Children do this deftly and with no 
eonfusion.] Now, we are going to score. Watch care- 
fully now. [Teacher reads the facts given and the 
answers clearly and slowly enough for each child to work 
accurately.] Count up the number that were missed, and 
put the number at the top. If they didn’t miss any, you 
may just put zero. Captains, pass to the board. - Pass 
papers back. First we'll take Marie’s team. Stand in 
line. Ready. [Pointing to June.] The class is waiting 
for your score. [June hesitates.] How many were there 
in all? 
Class. Twenty-one. 
Teacher. How many did you miss? 
June. 21 less 6 equals 16.

Class. 19. [The remainder of the team follows the method” 
but answers correctly, and a column of numbers is written 
on the board. The second team does the same, and the 
teacher calls upon a pupil from the opposite team to add 
each column placed upon the board.]

Teacher. We had four one hundreds. Let us clap for the 
winners. [Lesson to this point has occupied fifteen 
minutes.] Now we are going to have some problems 
[using book in her hands]. Mary’s mother is trying to 
economize to save sugar. If she finds that she can save 
four pounds every month, how many can she save in 
eight months? Marie. 
Marie. She can save thirty-two pounds. 
Teacher. This is a picture of Nora. She is at the store 
[showing picture on page 50 of the book]. She has some 
eggs in her basket and buys some more eggs. How can 
you find the number of eggs she has then? Show me by 
going to the board and pointing. [Teacher steps to the 
board and makes the signs for addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division.] Albert and Ruth may try. 
[Both skip to the board and point to the addition sign.] 
If Nora knows the price of one grapefruit, how does she 
find the price of six grapefruit. [Although the teacher 
used the book, she was not confined too closely to it.] 
John and Marie, try. [Both point to the multiplication 
sign. The following five problems are given, and when 
No. 8 is tried the children fail to grasp what is wanted.] 
4. If Nora buys a pineapple and some oranges, how does 
she find how much she must pay for them?
-P-A-G-E-215
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 197 
5. If Nora finds that the prices of two pineapples are not 
the same, how does she find how much cheaper one pineapple 
is than the other? 
6. If you know the number of pupils in each of two 
schools, how do you find the number in both schools? 
7. When you buy something and give the dealer more than 
the price, how do you find how much change is due? 
8. If you are told the number of trees in each row in an 
orchard and the number of rows, how do you find the number 
of trees in the orchard? 
Listen, again. If you are told the number of trees in 
each row in an orchard and the number of rows, how do 
you find the number of trees in the orchard? Think of 
an orchard with apple trees in it. Have you been out 
riding and seen apple blossoms? Play you are the 
orchard, class. How do trees stand? [Children straighten 
up. It happens that there are three rows with four 
children in a row.] Sit when you know the answer. This 
is a row. How would you find out how many trees? [All 
sit but five] June. 
June. Times. 
Teacher. What do you call times? 
Class. Multiply. ‘ 
Teacher. How many trees have you, Wanda? [Wanda appar- 
ently is not paying attention.] 
Wanda. Twelve. 
Teacher. If you know the number of apples in one box and 
the number in another box, how do you find the number 
in both boxes? Stanley and Bernadine. [Stanley points 
to the multiplication sign and Bernadine points to the 
addition sign.] Which one do you agree with? 
Class. Bernadine. 
Teacher. Stanley, if you had 25 in one box and 10 in another . 
box how would you find the number of apples in two 
boxes? (Stanley points to the addition sign.] How do 
you always find the amount of two things? 
Stanley. Add. 
Teacher. Ready for the next one. [Here two similar prob- 
lems from local experience are given and correctly solved. 
This is followed by a two-minute discussion of the prices 
of eggs, oranges, flowers, butter, and candy. The articles 
on which there was disagreement are to be looked up for

to-morrow as the work is to be based upon “buying.”] 
You may take your readers, and open them to page 64, 
and take the questions at the end of the chapter. 
9. Comments: The attention was sustained throughout the en- 
tire lesson. The response was nearly 100 per cent. The 
variation in the ability of pupils to solve problems was small 
compared to that in their abstract work. At the close of 
the lesson the teacher had the entire class come to the front 
of the room and engage in a lively game for about two 
minutes. The lesson required thirty minutes. 
A Sprntine Lesson, Grape 5 
1. Kind of school: A small graded school in the outskirts of 
the city with pupils from various types of families of the 
average American community. 
2. Teacher: A high-school and normal-school graduate with five 
years of experience. She is energetic, thorough, logical, 
and makes pupils feel their responsibility for accomplish- 
ment. 
8. Learning conditions: Lighting satisfactory, from left and 
rear. Temperature comfortable. The seats were well 
adjusted to the needs of pupils, two rows being adjust- 
able seats. The entire class recited, hence there were no 
distracting influences. 
4, Class activity: Initial work on a list of twenty words for 
the coming week. 
5. Children: There were twenty-eight enrolled. All were nor- 
mal as far as could be determined, and at normal age for 
the grade. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The children had 
completed the work for the year in fifth-grade spelling, and 
were beginning sixth-grade work. There was no study 
previous to the recitation as this lesson marked the beginning 
of a new exercise. 
7. Materials used: Blackboard; dictionary; pen and ink. 
Horn-AsupavcH Speller (Lippincott); twenty words 
from the review list at the beginning of sixth-grade 
work, 
8. The lesson: The following list of words is on the board

9. Comments: The preparation for dictation occupied six 
minutes. The dictation, which was given slowly, governed 
by the speed of the class, required five minutes. The words 
were written in ink. The correction and completion required 
four minutes. During the writing of the words the mem- 
bers of the class maintained good writing positions with 
the exception of six or seven pupils who lapsed into finger 
movement. The work to follow is an individual study of 
all the words missed on Tuesday. On Wednesday those 
who studied Tuesday will be tested. On Thursday words 
missed the second time will be studied by those needing this 
help. On Friday the entire class will write the original 
list. 
A GzocrapHy Lesson, Grape 7B 
1. Kind of school: A city school in a part of the city with a 
varied population. 
2. Teacher: High-school and normal-school graduate with sev- 
eral years of experience in rural, intermediate, and upper 
grades. Quiet, patient, gently insistent on things being done 
in a prescribed way. This gives an appearance of for- 
mality to the work which is, perhaps, really not formal. 
. Learning conditions: Opening period of the afternoon, room 
comfortable and well lighted, discipline of the type that 
does not indicate strain, yet involving implicit obedience. 
Every pupil was given a chance to recite before individuals 
were called upon. 
4, Class activity: A study recitation on advanced work on the 
general geography of the United States. 
5, Children: A small section of eleven pupils, ranging in age 
from eleven to fourteen years, with the following charac- oo 
teristics: 
Sherman—normal but flighty Violet—repressed 
Eldora—immature; absent fre- Ray—(14 years old) uneven tem- 
quently perament 
Abraham—normal Lillie—Swedish; speaks English 
Joseph—slow; a plodder brokenly 
Walter—above normal Ldith—hbright, but not vigorous 
Jean—a superior child

States in detail. The class will spend the rest of the term 
on a detailed study of Wisconsin. The work for the day 
was an advance study of new material. 
7. Materials used: Tarr anp McMurry, Second Book, New 
Geographies (Macmillan) ; wall map of the United States. 
8. The lesson: The children are sitting in order ready for the 
lesson. They have just finished a study recitation in reading. 
Teacher. Where was our country first settled? Class. 
Class. Along the Atlantic coast. 
Teacher [going to the map]. Yes, along here on this long, 
narrow strip close to the ocean. You had this when you 
studied the thirteen colonies in fifth-grade work. Can you 
remember how wide this strip of land is? [Class cannot 
remember.] Generally speaking, how wide were the thir- 
teen colonies? Think of your fifth-grade geography, 
United States geography. Can you not remember in your 
history of the United States how one piece was added 
and another was added? There is a little bit on the next 
page (page 197 in text). We'll come to it again. Can 
you answer this? Just look at your map. The first thir- 
teen colonies, we call them, what? Class. 
Class. Original. 
Teacher. Yes, because they came first. What do you suppose 
kept them in this narrow strip? Why did they stay 
there, Abraham? 
Abraham. Because of mountains. They couldn’t get over 
them at that time. They hadn’t explored the other side. 
Teacher. It hadn’t been explored at all? Were they (the 
colonists) absolutely sure about that? Joseph. 
Joseph. They hadn’t been over very much, and didn’t know 
how much territory was on the other side. They couldn’t 
see over the mountains. 
Teacher. Suppose they took trips over? Ray. 
Ray. No pathway. 
Teacher. What was the first pass across those mountains? 
Where is it, exactly. Think of your United States 
geography. What was there that would make it a natural 
pass? Walter. 
Walter [going to map and pointing]. Right here a river 
flows west and makes two rivers join. 
Teacher. What two rivers are they?
-P-A-G-E-221
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 203 
Walter. Ohio. 
Teacher. How is the Ohio formed? Class. Go back to your 
maps and find it. If you don’t find it on the map of the 
United States, that is, the map occupying the double page, 
you will have to turn to another page. What two rivers 
form the Ohio River? They join and form one river right 
here at Pittsburgh. You can’t remember every river, but 
I want you to remember those two. You must learn to 
look things up for yourself. When you get into 7A and 
take history, you’ll have to do a lot of those things your- 
self. Sherman. 
Sherman. Allegheny. 
Teacher. What is the other? Violet. 
Violet. Monongahela River. 
Teacher. What page did you find that on? 
Violet. Page 64. 
Teacher. Figure 64. Find those two rivers, class? Look 
again. Which comes from the north? 
Class. Allegheny. 
Teacher. And it makes what river when they join? Class. 
Class. Forms Ohio River. 
Teacher. Years ago there was a little: fort there. Fort 
Duquesne. In what ways did they go west? What was 
the beginning, of transportation? 
Mary. By water. 
Teacher. Yes, we have transportation by land, and now by 
water, and also by air. Is anything going by air now? 
Remember I told you about the crate of eggs. Many of 
them were broken, but they must have come by air be- 
cause they were found out in the meadow. When the 
plane swooped down they must have dropped them. You 
remember where it was. Out near Lone Rock. Where is 
that? How many have heard of Richland Center? That 
is on the direct route from Chicago to Minneapolis by 
air. People who live there see airships often. They use 
airships to carry mail from New York to Washington 
every day. Now, what two ways of transportation have 
we talked about? Class. 
Class. Water and land. 
Teacher. At the time the thirteen colonies were along the 
Atlantic coast what did they have to depend upon?
-P-A-G-E-222
204 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WOR 
Walter. Boats. 
Teacher. That’s why they had such an important gateway 
there [pointing to Pittsburgh]. Natural gateway. We 
spoke about waterways following rivers, following the 
Ohio and following what other? 
Roy. Mississippi. 
Teacher. And from Wisconsin what rivers? Across the 
state. 
Class. Wisconsin. 
Teacher. Across the plains, what great branch of the 
Mississippi? 
Class. Missouri. 
Teacher. Then what great thing happened? Turn to your 
books, page 196, class. Steam. The invention of steam. 
Did you find something in your geography about Robert 
Fulton? [This has been given out as a special topic.] 
Now I am going to see what you can get by reading. 
Tell me what Miss Aldrich (city instructor in use of 
libraries) said about reading? Joan. 
Joan. This college girl Miss Aldrich told us about could read 
all right, pronounced the words; but she couldn’t get the 
thought out of it. 
Teacher. After closing the book, she couldn’t tell what she 
read. Joseph. 
Joseph. She read but couldn’t tell what she was reading. 
Teacher. See that you make pictures when you read. Take 
the first paragraph (page 196, Exercise 4). Give me the 
thought out of that paragraph. Remember, use just as 
good English as you can, and make us get your thought. 
[Class reads for two minutes.] Walter. 
Walter. At that time there was... 
Teacher. Thought I heard you say, “There was.” . 
Walter. At that time there were thirteen daily papers in the 
United States, and they,could not be sent by mail. Letters 
cost from twenty to sixty*five cents, and they only sent 
them once in a while... 
Teacher. Walter, you read on. I just want the first para- 
graph. You see you read more than that. I want you to 
read and think so that you can get up on your feet and 
give the important thought in that paragraph. I can’t 
expect you to tell every single sentence, but I do want 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
    COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 205 
you to pick out the main sentence. Has he given us that, 
class? 
Class. No. 
Teacher. Think before you give us a thought. Joseph. 
Joseph. It took two days to go from Philadelphia to New 
York, and six days to go from New York to Boston. 
[The teacher asks Joseph to go to the map and point 
out these places. A discussion of three minutes follows 
dealing with the difference in time to travel then and 
now. | 
Teacher. Read the next paragraph. Remember to think. 
Make pictures as you read. [Class reads for one minute. ] 
Joan. 
Joan. A century ago there were only thirteen newspapers 
in the United States. They could not send parcels by 
mail. 
Teacher. Why not? 
Joan. It took so long. It cost them six to twenty-five cents 
for letters to be sent. x 
Teacher. What does it cost now? [Class answers, “Two 
cents.”] Do you remember what letters cost during the 
World War? During the Civil War mail was a great 
deal more. I think that continued for ten years after- 
wards, before a letter could go for two cents. Next para- 
graph, Ray. 
Ray. A letter from the smaller towns couldn’t be sent to 
make it worthwhile. 
Teacher. Look at the difference now. Remember when we 
made our railroad maps and took pages from booklets 
we got from different countries. What did we notice 
about the different countries? 
Class. Foreign railroads. 
Teacher. Let’s go on to the fine print. Make pictures. [One 
minute is given.] Books closed. Let’s see what you 
picked out, Joseph. 
Joseph. In each year thousands of carloads of fruit are 
shipped to New York from California. If there were 
not railroads, the business would stop and the food 
wouldn’t last very long; and, by and by, they would be 
raising the price about two cents more in value on the 
wheat and corn and other food, and that’s why we had 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
206 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
to be very careful of the railroad tracks, so they wouldn’t 
have accidents. 
Teacher. Walter. 
Walter. If we didn’t have railroads we would starve, because 
if we can’t get food from one section we couldn’t get it 
from another. In western states we couldn’t get furniture 
or anything that we are making to them in the western 
cities. 
Sherman. If the trains stopped, they could use autos. 
Abraham. Because of all this traffic, people can live in cities. 
A lot of people live in the suburbs now on account of 
having railroads. It is a lot more healthful in the 
suburbs. 
Teacher. Two people were not ready to tell us a thing. 
Walter. 
Walter. If railroads stopped running, there would be famines _ 
all over. 
Ray. If railroads and things would stop as means of trans- 
portation, we wouldn’t be able to get anything from 
California. Everything would stop, and there would be 
a famine in the large cities in a couple of days, and food 
would run out, and prices would rise higher. [Teacher 
ealls on Lillie.] 
Lillie. I have about the same thing to say. [Sherman is 
ealled on but gives no response though he raised his hand. 
Teacher calls on Edith.] 
Edith. Every year there are carloads of fruit sent to the east, 
and if the railroads didn’t run the eastern states would 
not have any fruit and it would be very extravagant. 
Teacher. Years ago there were not so many people living all 
over the United States. Most of the people lived near 
the eastern coast. Did the water help them to get across 
over here [pointing to central United States]. 
Ray. Takes too long. 
Teacher. Yes, food would spoil. By our study this afternoon 
you have helped me to know better how to help you. 
What you want to do is to read and think. How many 
read a paragraph the second time? [Six hands raised.] 
Is your picture clear in your mind? If you can’t remem- 
ber what you read five minutes after you read it, you 
can’t remember it after you leave school. Now do you 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 207 
  know what to do? I am not going to take any more time 
on the United States this year. We will take a few things 
in the next chapter, and then study Wisconsin, and take 
it the way we did the United States; where it is, how large 
it is, and our cities. This will be largely review work. 
Then we'll begin to see what Wisconsin is noted for. 
First, in how many things? How do you think now 
you can find your material in this geography if it is to 
be found there? You can do it by thinking. If you don’t 
understand it, what are you going to do? 
Class. Read it again. 
Teacher. If a word puzzles you what will you do? 
Class. Look it up. 
Teacher. Don’t you think we can make a much better study 
of Wisconsin if we go at our reading in this way? To- 
morrow we will begin on the next chapter (page 198) and 
study to the bottom of page 201. I am going to ask 
you to take your books home to-night. In class to-morrow 
we will work on Wisconsin in a general way. I am 
going to see if you can improve on to-day’s lesson. Do 
you think you can? 
Class. Yes. 
Teacher. Put your books away. [The entire lesson occupied 
a little more than twenty-five minutes. ] 
9. Comments: Class began work in reading following this 
exercise. They seemed to grasp the idea that their methods 
of study needed to be improved, and seemed to regret that 
they did not satisfy their teacher. There was no special 
problem assigned for the direction of the reading work. 
Aw Arirumetic Lesson, Grape 8A 
1. Kind of school: A city junior high school with very favor- 
able environment. 
2. Teacher: A normal-school graduate with one year at the 
university and ten years’ teaching experience in high schools 
and junior high schools. A firm, substantial, clear thinker, 
direct in presentation. She challenged the bright pupils to 
do their best thinking. She was inclined, perhaps, to dis- 
courage the weaker pupils. 
3. Learning conditions: A portable building with one window 
in front, making work on blackboard difficult to see. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  208 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
material on the board was well placed and written plainly. 
Chair desks were well adjusted. The pupils gave every 
indication of complete codperation. The class felt the force 
of the teacher’s energy and enthusiasm for mathematics. 
They seemed to realize that the teacher felt that they, in 
several cases, were not particularly apt at the subject. 
4, Class activity: An advance lesson taking up review examples 
in negative quantities. 
5. Children: Twenty-four pupils ranging in age from thirteen 
to fifteen; apparently normal except one child who was 
older and who found mathematies difficult. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The class had worked 
about sixteen weeks with daily reviews of the fundamentals, 
following self-checking plans such as the Studebaker and 
Courtis Practice Tests. They had also had frequent thought 
problems involving all the ordinary uses of arithmetic in 
daily life. Besides this they covered during the past 
thirty-four weeks the work in general mathematics in 
Taylor AND ALLEN Junior High School Mathematics, 
Second Book (Henry Holt & Co.). The immediate unit of 
work studied was Chapter VI, “Negative Numbers,” extend- 
ing from pages 110 to 121. Six lessons had been given 
previous to the lesson reported. The children had been 
asked to prepare the examples and problems from 8 to 21 
on pages 120 and 121 and to bring them to class on 
paper. 
7. Materials used: Courtis Practice Tests and pupils’ individual 
record books; textbook (noted above) ; blackboard work. 
8. The lesson: The teacher begins with a drill on the Courtis 
Standard Practice Tests, calling the numbers indicating the 
various cards that individual children need for their day’s 
test. Each child comes rapidly to the front, takes his card, 
places it under the tissue-paper sheet in his record book, 
and sits in position ready for work. At the command, 
“Begin,” they start work. The cards range in difficulty 
from column addition through long division. After five 
minutes the teacher takes the reports, and the pupils record 
the results in their books. This exercise lasts about eight 
minutes, and is in every way in agreement with the Courtis 
Plan. Many of the pupils report that they are trying their 
eards for the third and fourth times, and the teacher sug-

gests that they make an especial effort to get them right the 
first time. The problems for the advance lesson are as 
follows: 
8. How old at death was Cicero who was born in the year 
106 B.C. and died in the year 43 B.C.? 
9. Socrates was born 469 B.C. Confucius died 478 B.C. How 
long before the birth of Socrates did Confucius die? 
10. What can be added to — 2a” to get —7x? To + 8a to 
get — 5a? 
11. By what can —a be multiplied to get +a? By what 
can — x be divided to get + x? 
12. What can be added to s—3 to get a? What can be 
added to +3 to get x? 
13. By what can —¥ & be multiplied to get x? 
14, What can be added to 2a—3 to get —3? To —7 to 
get 0? 
15.3—1—4—7=?2 
16. —a—a=? 
17. (—a) (—a) + 2a (—a) =? 
18. —2?— (—2)?=? 
19. %—2(—2z) =? 
20. 2+ (—a#) =? 
21, —3?-- (—3)?=2% 
Teacher. Are there any questions about the work for to-day? 
Harold. Number 18. 
Teacher. We will begin with number 18. Isabel, we'll let 
you take 18: —2*’— (—2)*=? [Isabel tries to explain 
it but does not have it right and cannot solve it.] Now, 
Mary, try. 
Mary. I think that — 2’?— (—2)?= 2. 
Teacher. How much is two times two [pointing to (—2)7]? 
Mary. Four squared. 
Teacher. Positive or negative. 
Mary. Negative. 
Teacher. Even powers of a negative quantity give a positive. 
Is that true, Isabel? 
Isabel. Yes. 
Teacher. Is that true, Clarence? 
Clarence. Yes. [Teacher writes (— 2)? on board. Also —2_ 
—2 
+4]
-P-A-G-E-228
210 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. Isn’t this an even power of a negative number? 
Let’s look at the first part of Number 17: (—a)(—a). 
What does (— a) (—a) equal? 
Class. +a 
Teacher. Do you all agree? [They agree.] Then, even 
powers of a negative quantity give a positive. Now 
let us look at the first part of Number 18: —2*. This is 
minus 2 squared; this [pointing to (—2)*] is the 
quantity —2 squared. Is there any difference? [Class 
is undecided, and after two or three minutes of scattered 
incorrect reasoning the teacher continues.] Let us go 
back to page 118, exercise 60. Look over carefully and 
see if you can find some problem in that exercise that 
will help us with this. [The children work individually, 
and the teacher goes among them to see if any one has 
found an example that contains a parallel condition. 
Finally several agree that number 10 will help: — 6(-+-7) 
—2 
After some discussion in which they secure the correct 
answer to number 10, the teacher continues. ] 
Let us look farther. Donald, have you discovered 
something? Something that has a minus sign? Let’s get 
away from number 10. Henry. 
Harry. Number 17: (—3)* [This is discussed and solved 
—3   quickly. ] 
Teacher. Let us get one with an even power. [Class soon 
discovers an example containing the quantity (—3)*.] 
‘What do you get as a result, Arden? 
Arden. Positive nine. 
Teacher. How did you happen to get a positive nine? 
Arden. Minus by minus gives a plus. 
Teacher. So much for that. [Teacher writes on the board 
—2— (+4) = 2] Now square —2. 
Class. —4. 
Teacher [writes —4— (+4) = ?]. Suppose I write it this 
way: —4

Class. Subtract. 
Teacher. What is the answer?

COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 211 
Class. —8. [Teacher writes answer to complete equa- 
tion.] 
Teacher. Any other difficulties? Thomas. 
Thomas. I didn’t get that one—the 19th: x—2(—2) =? 
[The same method is followed in giving assistance in this 
example, except that the children do not refer to problems 
on page 118. In this example the particular difficulty 
lies in the fact that the pupils cannot distinguish between 
minuend and subtrahend, and do not know which sign to 
change when one quantity seems to be larger than the 
other. Instead of referring to previous examples in the 
book, the teacher put several on the board, such as: 
  
  —4a —136ab 16ay 
22 16ab 10ay 
—6a2 —152ab Gay 
She does not, however, complete the solution of the 19th 
during class time.] 
Teacher. Any other difficulties? Donald. 
Donald. The 22nd. 
Teacher. Now read it. 
Donald [reading]. If a=—4 and b = 2 find the value of 
b—2a’d. 
Teacher [writes on board as Donald reads]. Can you solve it? 
What does a equal? 
Class. a equals —4. 
Teacher. What does b equal? 
Class. 2. 
Teacher. Now what does 2a’b equal? Donald. 
Donald. b equals 2. 
@ equals — 4. 
4 squared equals 16. 
2 times 16 equals 32. 
2 times 32 equals 64. Then minus b equals 62. 
Teacher. What does a equal? 
Pupil. a equals —4. 
Teacher. Then a square, positive 16. Now who ean finish? 
Pupil. Two times positive 16 equals positive 32. b equals 
positive two, and two times positive 32 equals 64. b equals 
2, and subtracting we change the sign of the subtrahend 
and add. Positive 62 is the answer. 
Teacher. Didn’t you say your result of 2a’b was positive 64? 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  212 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
[Writes on board.] You have a positive 64. b had the 
value of what? Positive 2. Change the sign of the 
subtrahend, and proceed as you would in addition. Have 
you any other questions? Now let us take another one 
just like it. [Teacher writes: b equals 4 
@ equals —8 
b—2a’b equals ?] 
Everybody at work. [Pupils work at seats, and teacher 
walks about room giving individual help for about five 
minutes.] Watch your signs, boys and girls. What did 
you get for the result, Edna? 
Edna. +28. 
Teacher. Check it again. [Teacher asks again for the 
answer. Several raise hands, and teacher goes to their 
seats and looks to see if they are correct. Finding that 
several have succeeded, she steps to the board and writes 
the following: 
11. b equals —16 
a equals 8 b—2a% = 2] 
If you finished the first, try the second. Remember, 
boys and girls, dealing with positive and negative num- 
bers, the larger number does not have to be the subtrahend. 
That’s the advantage of having positive and negative 
numbers. Clarence, what did you get for a result? 
Clarence. — 2,032. 
Teacher. We get all kinds of answers. Now we will jot down 
the assignment for Monday. Page 121, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 
and the 28th. Then I am going to put five problems on 
the board similar to two or three we have struggled with 
to-day. 
%. Comments: The teacher collected no papers. This might 
have been classified as an exploration lesson for at least 
half of the class who must have left the room feeling that 
they did not understand the day’s work. The assignment 
required about three minutes of the forty-minute period.

people own their own homes and pay considerable attention 
to school environment.

COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES. 213 
2. Teacher: A high-school and normal-school graduate with two 
years’ experience in upper-grade work, 
8. Learning conditions: A late-afternoon period in a comfort- 
able room in which the physical conditions had been made 
very satisfactory; lighting, temperature, and atmosphere of 
room were favorable. There was a feeling of responsibility 
for accomplishment of satisfactory results. The teacher 
mentioned “position” and “attention” several times. Written 
work on the board was difficult to read. 
4, Class activity: A written lesson in silent reading involving 
the following of directions, ability to interpret, and general 
knowledge. : 
5. Children: They were said by the teacher to be character- 
istically a slow grade. One pupil was a special patient for a 
nervous disease. The entire group was fairly accurate in 
movements, but slow. Uniform methods of passing papers, 
sitting, standing, ete., were conformed to with difficulty. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The children spent 
thirty weeks reading the Elson and the Bolenius Sixth 
Readers. The Lincoln Reader had been used for group 
silent reading, checked by written questions. About 90 per 
cent of the work had been silent reading, and about 10 per 
cent, oral reading of poems and dramatic selections. Six 
exercises somewhat similar to the one reported had been 
previously given. The material for the year had been 
exhausted, and the teacher was required to cast about for 
profitable reading work for the class. 
7. Materials used: The lesson was taken from page 29 of the 
Lewis AnD Rownanp Sixth Reader (John C. Winston Co.). 
The teacher alone had a copy of the book. The lesson 
material was placed upon the blackboard. The teacher 
dictated the directions. 
8. The lesson: The children were supplied with paper and pencil. 
The first ten minutes were taken by the teacher to explain 
the exercise. The following groups of words were written 
on the board: 
Name is John boy’s 
Books made of iron are 
The teacher asked the children to read the words, and to 
change them around so they would make sense. This was 
done. Then she asked them to decide whether or not the sen-  
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
tences were true, and showed them how to arrange the words 
true or false after numbers 1 and 2. Then she asked them 
to follow as accurately as possible the directions she gave. 
Teacher. Arrange your paper with your name on the first 
line and your grade on the second. [Pupils comply.] At 
the left side of your paper number the next ten lines 
from number 1 to number 10. [Pupils comply.] Here 
on the board [pointing] are ten groups of words which 
ean be rearranged into good sentences. When they are 
rearranged in their right order, some will be true and some 
will be false. Look at the first set of words. Do not 
write the words in their right order, but see what they 
would say if rearranged. If what they would say is true, 
write the word true after figure 1 on your paper, but if 
what they would say is not true, write the word false after 
figure 1. Do this with each group of words. [The chil- 
dren are given twenty minutes to work.]

Class. We get silk from a silkworm called the caterpillar. 
Teacher. True or false, class? 
Class. True. [The remaining five groups are handled in the 
same manner, except that for the last few only about five 
children volunteer to read the sentences. ] 
Teacher. The pupils in the back seats may stand and collect 
the papers. Let’s have all desks straightened up. Carl, 
stay after school and get the geography. Pass the waste- 
basket. The sooner we get in good position the sooner 
we will go. 
9. Comments: About one half of the class finished the exercise. 
All but one (the nervous pupil) completed at least four. 
The error reported on the second sentence was made by an 
especially slow pupil. The teacher stated that she intended 
to look over the papers and return them at a later date. 
She also indicated that she would give addifional exercises 
similar to this to furnish added opportunities for practice 
for those who had failed to complete this one. 
A GrocrapHy Lesson, Grape 6 
1. Kind of school: Rural school, enrolling about thirty children. 
A considerable number of these children lived in a small 
rural hamlet, and moved frequently. Only a few spoke 
English at home. 
2. Teacher: A high-school training-department graduate, with 
two years of university training and three years of teach- 
ing. Vivacious, clear-headed, a good manager, and would 
probably be considered a strong teacher. 
3. Conditions for learning: Large, old, frame building. Poorly 
lighted, with two windows directly in front, one row of 
single seats, and all the rest double seats with large ones in 
back and smaller ones in front, with occasionally a large 
seat between two small ones. Young children so seated

low-placed windows. No curtains over windows except in 
front where curtains were lowered to the half sash. Room 
badly defaced and walls dark and dingy. Only two panels 
of slate boards available. Very comfortable temperature 
and plenty of fresh air added considerable comfort. 
4, Class activity: Sixth-grade geography recitation on the 
Pacific States. 
5. Children: Varying in age and ability. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The past twenty-two 
weeks had been spent on the United States. The class had 
followed the textbook method in the material included be- 
tween pages 174 and 184 of Brigham anp McFariann, 
Essentials of Geography, Book II, for the past week. Con- 
siderable map work had been done, and children had drawn 
the section and had located the physical and political 
features mentioned in the material. They were now ready 
to review, and the teacher had assigned for the day’s lesson 
the first paragraph of the questions on page 184 under the 
heading, “Review by States.” 
7. Materials used: Text as above; wall map. 
8. Other materials available: Book of Knowledge, ALLAN, 
Industrial Studies of North America, CARPENTER, Geo- 
graphical Readers. 
9. The lesson: The children come to the front seats, and sit in 
good order, speaking directly to the teacher. There is no 
attempt to address or interest other members of the class. 
Teacher. What states make up the Pacific states? 
Alma. California, Washington, and Oregon. 
Teacher. Point them out, Lawrence, please. [Lawrence goes 
to outline map. Cannot find them.] Write the names on 
the outline map, Edward. [Edward does this, writing 
full names in the state, and spelling correctly.] They are 
all right. We have noticed that the coast line of the 
Pacific states is very irregular. What would you expect 
to find there? 
All. Many harbors. 
Teacher. How does the straight coast line affect the har- 
bors? 
George. They can’t get in, because there is no inlet. 
Teacher. What makes coast lines irregular? 
Edward. The land is sinking.
-P-A-G-E-235
  
COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 217 
Teacher. When the land is sinking, does the ocean form 
different harbors? 
Class. Yes. 
Teacher. Does it do this when the land is straight? [Chil- 
dren hesitate.] No, it does not. Compare the rainfall 
in the southeastern part of California with that in the 
northwest. 
Mary. There is more rainfall in the southeast. 
Teacher. More rainfall than we have here? 
Mary. Yes. 
Teacher. Why? 
Mary. It is mountainous. 
Teacher. What mountains run through California? Sarah. 
Sarah. Sierra Nevada. 
Teacher. Yes, the Sierra Nevada [pointing to map]. Here 
we are in the southeastern part of California. The rain 
comes from the Pacific Ocean. Can the rain get over 
the mountains? No. Then it is dry. How do they get 
rain for their farms? 
Lawrence. They irrigate. 
Teacher. Yes, by irrigation. What are the mineral products 
of California, Lawrence? 
Lawrence. Gold, silver. 
Edward. Cork. 
Teacher. Where do they get the cork from? John. 
John. Trees. 
Teacher. What fruit do you expect to find there, Alma? 
Alma. Oranges, apples, bananas. 
Teacher. What else? William. 
William. Almonds, cherries. 
Teacher. Are almonds fruit? What are they? Junior. 
Junior. Nuts. 
Teacher. Yes, a kind of nut. What are the farm produets, 
Lawrence? 
Lawrence. Wheat, vegetables, fruit. 
Teacher. What is San Francisco noted for? Betty. 
Betty. Factories and the Golden Gate. 
Teacher. What is the Golden Gate, William? 
William. San Francisco bay. 
Teacher. Yes, San Francisco bay, the largest harbor on the 
western coast. What is the capital of California?

shakes her head.] Steven. 
Steven. Los Angeles. 
Teacher. All right, find it. [Steven goes to the map and 
looks in northern California.] You are looking too high. 
What is that noted for? 
Steven. It is the metropolis. 
Teacher. It is the largest city in the state. What great in- 
dustry surrounds it? [Class shake heads.] The moving- 
picture industry, Hollywood. [The lesson to this point 
has taken fourteen minutes. ] 
Teacher. To-morrow we are going to review the state of 
Oregon from the questions on page 184. 
Aw Arirumetic Lesson, Grape 2 
1. Kind of school: City grade in the better section of a uni- 
versity town. 
2. Teacher: A high-school and normal-school graduate with four 
years of experience in teaching in primary grades. She 
was quick, alert, cheerful, and quiet in her dealing with 
children. Codperation was excellent. Children displayed 
considerable responsibility for their own success. 
3. Learning conditions: A well-lighted, comfortable room 
somewhat lacking in cheerfulness although very neat. The 
blackboards displayed well-spaced, plain writing which could 
be easily seen. Seats were adjustable and suited to pupils’ 
needs. The whole atmosphere was favorable to quiet in- 
dustry. <A reading lesson had preceded. 
4, Class activity: A group test for the purpose of determining 
individual needs in subtraction combinations. 
5. Children: These ranged in age from six to eight. They were 
normal for grade, and all were making satisfactory progress. 
About thirty were present. 
6. Previous work and day’s assignment: The class had spent 
about twenty weeks on the usual second-grade work. The 
addition and subtraction facts had been grouped for 
presentation according to the answers that they gave; that 
is, the children learned everything that gave the answer 
six, ete. Previous to this lesson similar testing procedure
-P-A-G-E-237
  COMPOSITE CASE STUDIES 219 
had been followed with the addition facts. In the exercise 
below, the combinations had been chosen apparently at ran- 
dom, though facts taught early in the year predominated. 
The day’s preparation had consisted of twenty minutes of 
group study the day before from cards exposed in the chalk 
tray. Since each card contained the answer on the reverse 
side, the pupils were able to test each other with accuracy. 
7. Materials used: A pack of forty-five commercially printed 
cards containing subtraction facts on both sides. The 
answers were on the cards so the children could check their 
own results during study. The teacher flashed the cards 
but also spoke the combination, sometimes using the term 
less, and sometimes take away. These cards were flashed at 
the rate of about four a minute. 
8. The lesson: Spelling paper is passed by the monitors. 
Every child is equipped with a sharp pencil. 
Teacher. When you are ready, sit up nice and tall. [The 
children have been asked to write the numbers from one 
to forty-five on the left edge of their lined paper so as to 
be ready to write the answers to the combinations as they 
are flashed. ] 
Doris. Should we fold our paper? 
Teacher. Fold it quickly then. Now we will have a nice 
straight row to put your numbers on. [Children fold 
the paper vertically about one-half inch from the edge to 
form a margin line.] All ready, boys and girls. Up nice 
and tall. Everybody up. Pencils up. [Children raise 
their arms and hold their pencils above their heads. The 
teacher exposes the first card.] Ten less five. Put down 
your answers. Six less five [exposing second card]. Nine 
less two [third ecard]. Five less two [fourth ecard]. 
Eleven less nine [fifth card]. Hight take away six [sixth 
eard]. Hurry up, Bobbie. [The following cards are

9. Comment: The lesson period of twenty minutes had passed. 
There was not time to expose the last few cards. The 
teacher stated that she would correct the papers and use 
them as a basis for further individual and group drills to 
perfect the work on that particular list of facts. In the 
subsequent work to be done, the remaining facts were all 
concerned with significant figures—no zero combinations 
were included.

CHAPTER VIII 
PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 
Conferences to be effective should follow a well- 
thought-out program for the improvement of teaching. 
Up to this point the discussion has centered around the 
single or isolated conference. Following the statement of 
the plan of the book in Chapter I, Chapter II told ‘‘what 
to look for’’ in the study of teaching; Chapter ITI, ‘‘what 
to say’’ in helping the teacher to better teaching; Chap- 
ter IV, how to organize classroom visitation; and Chap- 
ters V, VI, and VII illustrated procedures of analyzing 
and commenting upon teaching through the study of 
concrete situations. In these chapters the attention was 
centered upon the isolated interview. As a matter of 
fact, however, if supervisory conferences were merely 
isolated discussions of teaching, they would not be par- 
ticularly effective. Conferences ought to be planned for 
a period longer than a single day. The principal or 
supervisor, in practice, having once arrived at an esti- 
mate of the teacher’s ability by the procedures already 
given, should plan a long-time program of assistance. 
This program will in many cases be laid out in units of 
two or three weeks, or months, or even years. It is the 
purpose of this chapter to discuss as concretely as pos- 
sible just such long-time, supervisor planning. 
Follow-up conferences should be the outgrowth of a 
definite instructional policy. Just as the work of the 
classroom is consciously directed by aims, general and 
specific, so should the work of the supervisor be guided 
222
-P-A-G-E-241
  PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 223 
by objectives, real and worthy of attainment. Assuming 
that the supervisor’s general. objective is the improve- 
ment of teaching, to be effective it must be expressed in 
certain more specific objectives, and these in turn sup- 
ported by a series of definite activities by which they 
may be realized. The specific objectives constitute the 
instructional policy, and the activities by which these 
objectives may be attained comprise the follow-up 
program. 
Follow-up conferences should be characterized by 
definiteness of purpose. A vague desire to improve 
teaching will hardly suffice. The supervisor of this type 
depends upon the occasion for an inspiration. He enters 
the classroom ‘‘to supervise’? and comment upon such 
things as fall, by chance, before his eyes. He gives many 
or few suggestions, depending upon the course of the 
recitation. Once the suggestion is given, it is dismissed 
from his mind. He feels relieved, and visits the next 
teacher. If he has taken a number of courses in super- 
vision, or is otherwise favorably disposed toward the 
activity, he may visit many teachers during the day and 
feel that he has done much good. 
The most fruitful procedure is to set out to realize cer- 
tain very definite goals, such as ‘‘economy of time in 
classroom management,’’ ‘‘one hundred per cent partici- 
pation, concentration, and attention,’ ‘‘teaching by 
projects,’’ ete. In planning the work it is well not to 
have too many irons in the fire at any one time. A few 
clearly defined objectives are far more productive of 
results. 
Follow-up conferences should be characterized by con- 
tinuity of action. Each conference should be one of a 
series of discussions for the improvement of teaching, 
interspersed with many isolated interviews. The task of 
the supervisor is that of training teachers in service.
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
This training, to be effective, requires a long-time con- 
tact, concentration of effort, and continuity of action. A 
discussion of project teaching to-day, the socialized reci- 
tation next week, the teaching of long division the week 
following, will bear little fruit. The supervisor may 
profitably work with a teacher for an entire semester 
and emphasize but a single problem. In fact, those 
teachers who have shown the greatest growth in a year 
have centered their attention, under the careful guidance 
of a skillful supervisor, upon some single unit of 
instruction. 
An illustration will make this clear. Miss B. was 
considered by the supervisor to be the poorest teacher in 
the city. She was not interested in her work, resented 
suggestions, and taught no subject well. The supervisor 
aroused her interest in remedial work in third-grade 
reading. Together they tested the reading group, both 
orally and silently, and listed the individual reading 
defects of the pupils. A diagnostic sheet was prepared 
for the class, and special exercises were devised for each 
type of reading error. These drill devices were tried out, 
and some were eliminated as unsuitable. A large amount 
of special drill material was collected and used. Special 
tests were prepared to measure progress in overcoming 
each defect. Careful records of this progress were kept, 
and pupils were informed of their growth. By the close 
of the year this class had accomplished more in reading 
than any other third grade in the city. The teacher had 
a new lease of professional life, and had become not only 
an excellent teacher of reading but had grown tremen- 
dously in all phases of teaching. By centering attention 
upon one problem, and by continued study in a single 
field under the guidance of the supervisor, she had 
acquired certain fundamental principles of teaching that 
functioned in all of her work.   
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  
PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 225 
Follow-up work after visiting. Miss Olive Gray makes 
the following suggestion concerning follow-up work after 
the supervisor’s visit: + 
After the visit the supervisor needs (1) to meet the needs of 
the teacher visited and (2) to file in good shape for reference 
data of the visit. 
In meeting the needs of the teacher visited, it is well to write 
one or more follow-up letters subsequent to the visit. Use data 
recorded at the time of the visit, and make the letter stimulating 
and practically helpful. Sometimes it is well to ask the teacher 
to report at a given time the progress that shall have been made 
by that time with reference to some specific matters in which 
improvement is being sought. 
Often packages of material should be sent following the visit 
if the office is prepared to help in that way. 
A convincing report to the superintendent of the need of teach- 
ing equipment or of improved physical conditions often serves 
to bring this type of assistance to the teacher. 
The reference file when complete should include (1) notes on 
the observation; (2) a copy of the recommendations left with 
the teacher or sent in a follow-up letter; (3) recommendations 
made to the superintendent; (4) necessary data for supervisor’s 
reports; (5) a list of things to do or observe on the next visit. 
It is well to use a form to be filled in with specific observations 
during the visit or immediately afterward. : 
Visits after the first one should follow up matters that the 
records of the first visit show were regarded as important at that 
time. The recommendations that are made must accord with 
those made during the previous visits or else frankly announce 
a change in policy. 
TypicaL Fottow-Up Programs 
We shall next consider some typical follow-up con- 
ferences. Three examples of programs will be dis- 
cussed.

  226 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
1. Helping a teacher new to the school to adjust her- 
self to strange surroundings. 
2. Assisting a superior teacher with some experimen- 
tal studies of teaching procedure. 
8. Studying economy of time in classroom manage- 
ment. 
In order to get the first of these situations clearly 
in mind, the discussion will start with a conerete 
ease. 
1. Program for a teacher new to the school system. 
A teacher who had met with considerable success in a 
smaller school system, and who had acquired by hard 
study a technique of her own, was appointed to a teach- 
ing position in a large school system. She was assigned 
to a social-science room. She found the course of study 
new and the routine reports complicated. Teachers were 
expected also to use tests, formal and informal. The 
principal was a strong advocate of the project method. 
The teacher’s previous success had been due to her very 
charming personality, complete mastery over subject mat- 
ter, and excellent discipline. Her methods, highly praised 
by her former principal, although recognized as good by 
the new principal, were not in harmony with his ideas 
of teaching. 
The first semester. After a thorough diagnosis of the 
ease, the principal set about patiently but systematically 
to assist the teacher in making her adjustments to the 
new and difficult situation. Instead of attempting to give 
the teacher the total situation, that is, all of her short- 
comings at the first interview, he planned a series of 
conferences distributed over the entire year. The plan 
for the first semester was as follows:
-P-A-G-E-245
  PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 227 
Week First 
Problem: To acquaint the 
teacher with routine pro- 
cedures. Activity: The teacher was 
given a mimeographed copy 
of “Instructions to Regular 
Teachers.” This material con- 
tained essential information as 
follows: first day at school, 
regular school days, holidays, 
last day of semester, supplies, 
records, reports, teachers’ meet- 
ings, general management, ete. 
A conference of teachers new 
to the building was planned for 
the end of the first week. 
Second Week 
Problem: To acquaint the 
teacher with the course of 
study. (During the first week’s 
work the teacher gave the class 
the necessary reviews, and 
studied the individual possibili- 
ties of each pupil.) 
Third 
Problem: To acquaint the 
teacher with methods of han- 
dling problems of discipline in 
a large school system. (Prob- 
lems in discipline probably will 
not appear before the third 
week.) Activity: “The course of 
study in the social studies, 
Grades 1-6.” In the conference 
at the end of the week the prin- 
cipal explained how the course 
of study came into being, the 
larger objectives, and where 
materials might be found to 
make the course of study 
effective. 
Week 
Activity: Read: CUBBERLEY, 
The Principal and His School, 
Chapter XV. (The principal 
explained what he expects of 
the teacher in discipline, what 
assistance he could give, and 
other matters concerning dis- 
ciplinary cases.)
-P-A-G-E-246
228 
Problem: To acquaint the 
teacher with the general ad- 
ministrative and instructional 
policies of the principal. 
(Every principal has clearly in 
mind, if not on paper, the 
larger objectives for which he 
is striving.) 
  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Fourth Week 
Activity: The principal put 
into the hands of the teacher 
printed, mimeographed, and 
typewritten materials previ- 
ously distributed to teachers. 
He also placed in the hands of 
the teacher Some General 
Standards for the Improve- 
ment of Teaching (see pp. 22- 
32). 
Fifth Week 
Problem: To acquaint the 
teacher with the teaching 
standard of the building. 
(Many teachers fail because 
they do not know what is ex- 
pected.) Activity: Observation of the 
teaching of several teachers of 
the building. 
Sixth Week 
Problem: To introduce the 
teacher to a new procedure in 
method. Activity: The principal 
recommended the reading of 
one of the following: Kinpar- 
RICK, The Project Method; 
Teachers’ College Bulletin, 10th 
Series, No. 3; McMurry, 
Teaching by Projects; BRANOM, 
The Project Method in Educa- 
tion. 
Seventh Week 
Problem: To continue the 
study of the project method. Activity: The principal 
planned a demonstration of the 
project method for teachers 
new to the system (conference 
to follow).

Eighth Week 
Problem: To continue the 
study of the project method. Activity: The principal 
visited the teacher at work, and 
discussed informally some of 
the difficulties involved in mak- 
ing project teaching a success. 
Ninth Week 
Problem: To continue the 
study of the project method. Activity: The principal in- 
vited the supervisor of social 
studies to a conference on the 
project method. 
Tenth Week 
Problem: To continue the 
study of the project method. Activity: The principal 
planned a group conference 
for teachers new to the system. 
This was followed by individual 
assistance. 
Eleventh Week 
Problem: To continue the 
study of the project method. Activity: The principal 
planned for the visitation of 
other schools where the project 
method was in use. 
Twelfth Week 
Problem: To continue the 
study of the project method. Activity: The principal 
asked for a lesson plan de- 
veloped on the project plan. 
The principal planned a “be- 
fore teaching” conference.
-P-A-G-E-248

Problem: To continue study 
of the project method. 
  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
* Thirteenth Week 
Activity: The principal 
visited the teacher at work, and 
commended specifie evidences 
of progress. 
Fourteenth Week 
Problem: Test week. Activity: The principal 
placed in the teacher’s hand the 
booklet of directions and the 
mimeographed materials, ex- 
plaining how tests were to be 
given. 
Fifteenth Week 
Problem: Test week. Activity: The principal gave 
for teachers new to the system 
a demonstration of the method 
of giving and scoring tests. 
This was followed by indi- 
vidual assistance. 
Sixteenth Week 
Problem: To acquaint the 
teacher with the use of the test 
score. Activity: A group vonfer- 
ence was called for teachers 
new to the system to discuss 
results and the best methods of 
using results. This was fol- 
lowed by individual assistance. 
Eighteenth Week 
Problem: Semester reports. Activity: In a group confer- 
ence for teachers new to the 
system, the principal discussed 
the plan of marking, the form 
in which the reports were to be 
made, and matters pertaining 
to closing the semester’s work.
-P-A-G-E-249
  PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 231 
2. Assisting a superior teacher with some experi- 
mental studies of teaching procedures. The principal’s 
purpose was to develop a more effective procedure for 
teaching children abstract or general meanings. 
First Interview 
Activity: The principal 
told the teacher of some inter- 
esting experiments about which 
he had been reading. 
Second Interview 
Activity: The principal 
asked the teacher if she had 
seen a certain book, and added 
later that he had a copy which 
he would be glad to lend her. 
Third Interview Problem: To stimulate in- 
terest and create the proper 
attitude. 
Problem: To stimulate in- 
terest and create the proper 
attitude. 
Problem: ‘To stimulate the 
teacher to experiment. Activity: The principal told 
of his interest in experimenta- 
tion, commented upon the 
teacher’s superior ability, and 
raised the question, “Aren’t 
there some experiments that we 
could try together?” The 
teacher left the conference to 
think of possible experiments. 
Fourth Interview 
Problem: To focus the at- 
tention of the teacher on 
“acquiring abstract and gen- 
eral meanings.” Activity: Various problems 
were discussed. The principal 
told the teacher of a rather 
erude experiment that he had 
performed some years ago, and 
gave her a typewritten copy of 
the material.
-P-A-G-E-250
232 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Fifth Interview 
Problem: To plan ways and 
means of studying the acquir- 
ing of abstract and general 
meanings experimentally. Activity: Many possible ex- 
periments were discussed. The 
following short experiments 
were decided upon: (1) The 
relative effect of general dis- 
cussion, carefully directed 
studies, and familiar examples 
drawing upon the pupils’ per- 
sonal experiences; (2) the 
relative effect of definition pre- 
ceded by developmental exer- 
cises and definitions learned; 
and (3) the relative effect of 
definition followed by practice

viewed. 
Sixth Interview 
Problem: To familiarize the 
teacher with the experimental 
procedure. Activity: The principal 
gave the teacher a one-page 
piece of mimeographed ma- 
terial, “How to experiment,” 
and said, “If you have difficulty 
in planning the experiment I 
shall be glad to assist you.” 
Seventh Interview 
Problem: To study the 
teacher’s plan for experiment 
one. Activity: The principal had 
at hand a similar experiment 
illustrating amply the proper 
procedure. 
Eighth Interview 
Problem: To study the find- 
ings of experiment one. Activity: The teacher used 
two comparable groups, and re- 
peated the experiment in three 
different class periods.

Ninth Interview 
Problem: To study the find- 
ings of experiment two. Activity: The principal and 
teacher studied the findings to- 
gether, and the principal com- 
mended the teacher on the 
results. 
Tenth Interview 
Problem: To study the find- 
ings of experiment three. Activity: The principal and 
the teacher studied the findings 
together. The principal asked 
the question, “What conclu- 
sions can be drawn from the 
three experiments?” 
Eleventh Interview 
Problem: To formulate a 
general procedure for teaching 
children abstract or general 
meanings. Activity: The principal had 
at hand a copy of ParKEr, 
Methods of Teaching in High 
School; the teacher, a statement 
of her findings. The confer- 
ence consisted of comparing 
results, and drawing up a set 
of rules covering the best pro- 
cedure for teaching children 
abstract and general meanings. 
The principal merely remarked 
at the end of the conference 
that he would like to try out 
the principle. 
Twelfth Interview 
Problem: To plan a lesson 
applying best procedure in 
teaching abstract and general 
meanings. Activity: The principal 
worked with the teacher on a 
lesson plan. He commended 
the teacher on her experiment, 
and expressed a desire to see 
whether the plan would really 
work.

3. A study of the economy of time in classroom 
management. The principal’s purpose was to introduce 
time-saving devices into classroom management. The case 
is one of an inexperienced teacher. 
Step One 
Problem: To discover the Activity: The principal

PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 235 
mended the teacher upon cer- 
tain specific devices for saving 
time. At the close of the con- 
ference he told the teacher that 
he was making a study of use- 
ful devices for saving time, 
and asked if she would not 
assist by listing those that she 
used during a period of a week. 
Step Two 
Problem: To inform the 
teacher of other devices for 
saving time. Activity: The teacher had 
listed from her week’s study 
several effective devices. After 
commending specific points of 
strength, the principal gave the 
teacher a mimeographed copy 
of “The Organization of the 
Room for Work” (see p. 22), 
saying that he had found these 
items helpful. The principal 
also suggested that the teacher 
try some of the devices during 
the week, and return Friday 
for further discussion. 
Step Three 
Problem: To lead the teacher 
to discover strong and weak 
points in her own teaching. Activity: The principal 
opened the conference by 
allowing the teacher to tell of 
her experience in using certain 
of the devices. Then he said, 
“Which of these devices do you 
now use?” “Of those that you 
already use which do you use 
the most effectively?” “Which 
the least effectively?” At the 
end of the conference the

teacher was given a mimeo- 
graphed copy of “Objective 
Measures of Economy of Time 
in Classroom Management,” 
with the suggestion that she 
make some objective check on 
her devices, and return again 
at the end of the week for con- 
ference. 
Step Four 
Problem: To lead the teacher 
to discover four or five out- 
standing weaknesses in man- 
agement. Activity: The principal had 
at hand a typewritten copy of 
a similar study, made the 
previous year, of the economy 
of time throughout the entire 
building. The principal and 
teacher together studied the re- 
sults of the two reports. The 
principal recalled that other 
teachers had found practice on 
specifie devices helpful. The 
teacher suggested that certain 
devices be selected for special 
study. Five were chosen for 
particular consideration. (a) 
Time lost in passing and col- 
lecting papers; (b) time lost in 
checking absences and tardi- 
ness; (c) time lost in writing 
long lists of problems, words, 
ete., on the board during the 
recitation period; (d) time lost 
because materials, books, sup- 
plies, and equipment were not 
conveniently placed; (e) time 
lost in dictating outlines, lists 
of references, ete., which might 
have been supplied pupils in 
mimeograph form.

    PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 237 
Step Five 
Problem: To devise ways 
and means of saving time in 
passing and collecting papers. Activity: The teacher ex- 
perimented with several de- 
vices, but finally settled upon 
two. By the end of the week 
she had effected an actual sav- 
ing of five minutes average 
elass time daily through the use 
of more effective devices. 
The principal commended the 
teacher on her success. 
Step Six 
Problem: To devise ways 
and means of saving time in 
checking absences and tardi- 
ness. Activity: Procedure similar 
to Step Five.

and means of saving time lost 
because materials, books, sup- 
plies, and equipment were in- 
conveniently placed. Activity: Procedure similar 
to Step Five. 
Step Nine

Case Stupres or Fottow-Ur CoNFERENCES 
The first part of this chapter gave illustrations of the 
organization of conference work. Three examples were 
given: (1) Helping a teacher new to the school system; 
(2) assisting a superior teacher with some experimental 
studies of teaching procedure; (3) studying economy of 
time in classroom management. It is the purpose of 
this part of the chapter to report a concrete study 
of the follow-up conference. In the report to follow, the 
teacher was not new to the system, but relatively inex- 
perienced in the teaching of handwriting. The purpose 
of the visits was to establish certain teaching habits. 
Although the series of conferences did not extend over 
an entire semester, they accomplish the goal to be 
attained.

A 4A Crass In Hanpwrrrine? 
I. Lesson Setting 
1. Remarks: A regular lesson in handwriting, which consisted 
of a study period, a testing period, and checking period, 
was observed. The length of the period was twenty minutes. 
Pupils progressed at their own rate. Some pupils were 
on lesson two, some on lesson three, some on lesson four, 
ete. One child was on lesson thirteen. The entire set of 
lessons for this grade consisted of fifteen units. Pupils 
were stimulated to determine their own difficulties. 
2. Kind of school: A new building drawing pupils from three 
schools, open nine weeks. Children were largely foreign 
born: United States (white), 30 per cent; United States 
(colored), 21 per cent; Canadian, English, German, Hun- 
garian, Italian, Russian, Rumanian, 49 per cent. 
8. Teacher: High-school graduate; graduate from state normal 
school; taught in the primary grades until taking up the 
special work in handwriting this semester. A very good 
writer, interested in the work; a pleasant manner with 
the pupils; understood them and worked with them whole- 
heartedly. : 
4. Learning conditions: A well-lighted room; desks suited to 
most pupils; pupils supplied with books, paper, and pens. 
Twenty-minute period each day. The teacher had been to 
the supervisor’s office for assistance, and had asked to have 
a visit made to see her classes at work. 
5. Children: There were forty-five pupils in the class.   
II. The Lesson Observed 
Teacher. Boys and girls, we will practice part of the time this 
morning, then we will have a test. Captains, stand. Sam, 
you are too noisy. 
Sam. You told me I could be captain. [Captains pass pens and 
papers. | 
  
4The supervisory interview was conducted by Miss Lena Shaw, 
supervisor of handwriting, Detroit public schools. The lesson was 
taught by Miss Martha Grace, teacher, Detroit public schools.

  240 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. Be sure and get your materials ready first. [Pupils 
get pens and papers ready. Teacher stands in front of 
room. About two minutes’ time is taken by the pupils to 
get the material ready.] 
Teacher. Now let’s see what nice study papers I can have this 
morning. What is it, Sam? 
Sam. Ihave no paper. [Teacher gives some paper to Sam.] 
Teacher. What is it, Ella? 
Ella. What is to-day [meaning date]? 
Teacher. Now look on your score card, and see what day yester- 
day was. To-day is the thirtieth. [Pupils are busy writing.] 
Pupil. How do you make the u? [Teacher goes to the pupil 
and shows him how to make the w.] 
Teacher. All right, Jennie, you may ask the questions, and 
we will study our papers together this morning. [The pupils 
have been working on lessons. Jennie reads the following 
questions from the board: (1) Are your letters on the line? 
(2) Are your small letters the same size? (3) Are your 
letters the same slant? (4) Did you finish the last letter? 
Each pupil checks his practice after each question, and 
makes it C if he thinks it correct.] 
Teacher. How many have all C’s this morning? How many 
have all X’s? How many have two X’s? How many have 
three X’s? [Hands are raised.] 
‘Anna. My letters are not the same size. 
Teacher. That seems to bother most of us, doesn’t it? [Teacher 
goes to the pupil and assists her.] 
Supervisor. How many have written your lesson just the very 
best you can? Now write once more the very best you can. 
[The supervisor goes to the board, and shows the children 
how to write a. She also writes American on the board. 
One pupil has made a poor a in the last part of the word. 
Some of the pupils show their papers to the supervisor. 
She assists several pupils with their papers. To one pupil: 
“Oh, I like that so much better.”’] 
Pupil to Supervisor. I do not know how to make a Q. [Super- 
visor goes to the board, and shows the pupils how to make 
aQ.] 
Supervisor. Do you know what you are trying to do on your 
paper, boys and girls? You are trying to talk on your paper 
with your hands, and you want to talk very, very plainly.
-P-A-G-E-259
PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 241 
You know the kind of letter you want your hand to make, 
and you must say to your hand, “See here, hand, I don’t 
want that kind of letter, I want a good one.” [Pupils smile 
and go to work.] 
Supervisor. How many have written your lesson the best you 
can? That is half of the job. I wish you could plan how 
many of these words you could place on the line nicely. 
How many are working on the word quickly? How many 
are writing the words Detroit, Michigan? Write as many 
on the line as you think would look well. [The supervisor 
and the teacher move around the room, giving assistance to 
the pupils. Note: “Habits of work” is an important factor 
in the day’s lesson.] 
Pupil. It is hard to make the letter Z. [Supervisor goes to the 
board and shows the pupil just how to make the letter Z.] 
Supervisor. Make it just a little wider. Do you think that 
looks better? [The pupil tries to make Z on the board. 
The supervisor stays with the pupil to make sure the pupil 
corrects the error. The satisfaction on the part of the pupil 
when he makes it right is interesting. ] 
Supervisor [to class]. I like the way your capital letters stand 
out against your small letters, [Many children show their 
papers to the supervisor. ] 
Supervisor. Boys and girls, I want you to try and see how easily 
and quickly you can write this. Some people make such 
hard work of it. How many think they can write it easily 
now? [Children raise hands. This is done to have the 
pupils relax and sit in a good position.] 
Teacher. All ready for the test, boys and girls. [Pupils get 
their papers ready for the test.] 
Teacher. John, how are you going to sit when you take your 
test; not only when you take your test, but always? [John 
illustrates by sitting up in his seat.] 
Teacher. Start. [The pupils start writing busily. The teacher 
times the pupils while they write.] 
Teacher. Stop. [The pupils have written for three minutes. 
Pupils raise hands.] 
Teacher. Score your papers quickly, boys and girls. [The 
pupils score their papers, and show them to the super- 
visor and teacher to see if they agree with their judgment.] 
Supervisor. Boys and girls, look here just a minute. I saw this

girl counting each word in her work. She has four on the 
line and three whole lines. How many has she? How 
many counted yours,;in the same manner? [Hands are 
raised. Many other things are taught along with the writing 
lesson. ] 
‘Teacher. Boys and girls, pass your papers quickly and get 
ready to move. I am watching to see who works the fastest. 
Who is the captain in this row? Harold, are you captain? 
I like this row over here the best of all. [The pupils take 
up the papers of those who passed the lesson. The other 
papers are kept to be used in the study lesson the following 
day.] 
Teacher. Let’s not leave any papers around. [The supervisor 
compares papers with the writing scale.] 
Supervisor. How many are on lesson two? How many on 
lesson three? Have you been on the lesson very long? 
[This is not a part of the day’s lesson. It was recom- 
mended that special standards be given for pupils who could 
not pass a lesson in three or four trials.] 
Supervisor. Didn’t the girl who was working on Z get a better 
Z [looking at the work done by the pupil at the board]? 
Z is a letter we do not use very much, but we need it. [To 
teacher.] How many passed the test? 
Teacher. Twenty-eight pupils passed. [The teacher looks over 
the papers to check up the pupils’ scoring. The pupils pass 
out of the room.] 
III. The Supervisor’s Instructional Diagnosis 
The lesson was visited by the supervisor for two purposes: 
(1) to determine the degree to which the teacher had developed 
the proper procedure; and (2) to determine what phases of the 
lesson could be improved. The “Items to be Observed,” men- 
tioned above, were followed, and help was given to pupils at 
various stages in the lesson to strengthen that particular part 
of the work. 
A little confusion might have been avoided when the pupils 
started to work by leading them to assume more responsibility 
in the care of the material necessary to carry on the lesson. 
During the study period the supervisor was especially con- 
cerned with the habits of work developed in the pupils. Assist-
-P-A-G-E-261
  
PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 243 
ance was given to stimulate them to appraise their practice work 
for better arrangement of work and more fluency in writing. 
One outstanding problem was that of position. The pupils 
appeared to be rather tense in their work, and many pupils were 
sitting with their bodies badly slumped. 
There was evidence of dissatisfaction on the part of some 
pupils when they were not writing as well as they wanted to, and 
satisfaction when the objective was finally reached. The teacher 
aided those in the former group, and observed the work in the 
latter by way of checking the pupil’s judgment. The teacher 
might have used the board, and helped at once several pupils 
having the same difficulty, thus saving time. The questions asked 
the group were good, for they were problems common to all, 
regardless of the lesson being studied. 
The lesson as a whole was quite well worked out, and promised 
to bring about good results not only in writing but also in good 
habits of work, self-direction, self-appraisal, and codperation. 
IV. The Supervisor’s Interview 
Teacher. I wish I did not get nervous. 
Supervisor. You have not been working with these children so 
very long, have you? 
Teacher. No, about nine weeks. There are so many problems. 
I have so much trouble with the Z’s. I spoke to you about 
the arrangement of the lessons on the paper. In the lesson 
Detroit, Michigan they will crowd it if they try to put two 
on a line. 
Supervisor, You need to do more directing and stimulating in 
your x group [meaning the slower pupils]. What I wanted 
them to do after they had written the lesson well, was to 
plan how many words or groups of words should be placed 
upon a line. This develops spacing and appearance of the 
work. You have the procedure of the whole lesson worked 
out finely. Keep working to get a balance between indi- 
vidual and group instruction. 
Teacher. Just what do you mean by the group? 
Supervisor. You brought this out when the child asked all pupils 
to check after being asked the questions on the board. “Does 
the last part of the work look as well as the first part?” 
ete. You need to work a little more on position, When
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
you say, “Sit up straight,” ask the pupils, “Why do I ask 
you to sit up straight?” The children begin to think. You 
want them to get the weight off their hands. By sitting up 
straight the weight is taken off the hands. Ask them to 
experiment. Find out for themselves. Lead them to reason 
out what you mean. I would work on that. I think we 
need to do quite a little to promote better positions. 
Teacher. I wonder why it is hard to get the children to sit up 
straight? I feel the positions are not as good as I would 
like to have them. 
Supervisor. They want to see what their pencils are doing. 
Say to them, “See how easily you ean write this.” Get 
away from laborious writing. This trouble is general 
throughout the city, and I am working on it generally. 
Teacher. I have told the children that their arms are doing two 
. things—writing and holding up the hand. 
Supervisor. Get it as simple as you can. Stimulate them to 
get the hand to write easily. Some pupils may get a good 
deal of help by seeing you write on the board. They wish 
to see the movements you make while writing. 
Teacher. I encourage some children when they first start the 
lessons to bring each stroke down to the line. Do you think 
that helps any? I find that helps them to get better slant. 
Supervisor. Yes, I think some would be helped, but don’t let 
such writing become too angular. No two of them learn in 
the same way, so I would vary my suggestions and watch to 
see the reaction on the part of the pupils. The pupils score 
pretty well. Only two or three marked high. I would keep 
putting more responsibility on the captains, so that the 
material would be all ready to give out, and take as little 
time as possible. 
Teacher. How about the children who have finished the lesson? 
Do you have any objections to giving them the fifth-grade 
work? 
Supervisor. I would suggest that they write on the board some- 
time. Another way to do is to have them plan some lessons 
that involve thinking on the part of the pupils, such as 
writing the ten largest cities in order of size. Pupils may 
take as much time as they like to learn these. Tell them 
they are responsible for their time. Some may wish to read. 
Usually good writers like to write, and opportunity should 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 245 
be given them to do so as far as it is possible. I would 
not recommend taking the work of an advanced grade. 
V. A Lesson Observed Two Weeks Later 
Teacher. You know, boys and girls, Miss Shaw had such a nice 
visit last time that she is coming back again. Let’s have a 
better lesson to-day. Take your writing materials. Cap- 
tains come to the front. 
Captain 1. Does any one need pens? [The children who need 
pens raise their hands.] : 
Teacher. Just as soon as we have our materials assembled we 
can practice. [Some of the children begin to practice writ- 
ing. The principal comes into the room.] 
Pupil. Is my work spaced right? 
Supervisor [to pupil]. Yes, your words are well spaced. What 
is this letter [pointing to b]? Does that look like f? What 
is the difference between these two letters? f crosses on the 
line, and b does not cross. [The pupil is shown the differ- 
ence. He goes to his seat, and works upon the problem until 
he is satisfied with the results, then shows the same to the 
supervisor. Satisfaction is shown by his beaming face.] 
Pupil. How do you make j? 
Supervisor. I have to stop at the top of j, then make the rest 
of the letter. Does that help you? I have to stop and get 
my balance. I think about three words on a line would look 
nice. [This is done to show the pupils the units of motion 
involved in making the letter j and the word as well.] 
Pupil. I can’t make a q. 
Supervisor. Make your q like a. [The pupil is shown at the 
board. Many children come to the supervisor for help.] 
Supervisor. Boys and girls, I think it would be better if Miss 
Grace and I came to you. [The children go to their seats, 
and the supervisor and teacher go to the pupils individually, 
helping them at their seats. ] 
Supervisor [at the board]. Boys and girls, & is like h, only we 
must get it like this. [The supervisor at the board shows 
the children how to make the & and how it differs from h; 
also the units of motion involved in the performance.] 
Teacher. How many boys and girls are writing the word jump- 
ing? I notice you are having trouble with the j, and you 
make it taller than the rest of the letters. All the letters   
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  246 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
must be the same size, even the j. Should you make the j 
tall? [Teacher illustrates at the board.] 
Children. No, ma’am. 
Teacher. How tall should you make the j? 
Children. One-half space. 
Teacher. Yes, remember that. [The children show their papers 
to the supervisor and to the teacher.] 
Teacher [to one pupil]. Now is the j taller than, or the same size 
as, the rest of the letters? Now you must make your other 
letter come right even with that. 
Supervisor. This girl back here had the same problem. Get 
those tall letters real tall. [If pupils know that others have 
the same problem they are encouraged to try harder to see 
who can overcome the difficulty quickest. ] 
Supervisor [to pupils]. Yes, that is it. [To pupil who has over- 
come the difficulty.] That is fine. [To another pupil.] Try 
to do it more easily. [This is said to emphasize fluency in 
execution. ] 
Teacher. Boys and girls, let’s look for our mistakes together. 
[One pupil goes to the front of the room, and reads the 
following questions to the class. The class look at their 
papers and check while she reads. 
(1) Are your letters on the line? 
(2) Are your small letters the same size? 
(3) Are your letters the same slant? 
(4) Did you finish the last letter?] 
Teacher. Those who had all C’s may stand. Those who had 
one C may stand. How many had three @’s? Four (’s? 
[Pupils stand.] 
Teacher. All right, that was a pretty good lesson this morning. 
Now. how many had trouble with the first one? Anna, do 
you know anything that will help you? [Anna receives help 
at this time.] How many missed the second one? Not so 
many. Now try it again and see if every one can have 
four C’s. [The pupils are in a frame of mind to be helped 
when they are aware of their peculiar difficulty. Dismissal 
bell rings.] 
Teacher. Put your writing material away, quickly, boys and 
girls. I am going to see which row is ready first. [The 
children put material away very quickly.] 
Teacher. First row pass. Second row pass, ete.

‘PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 247 
VI. The Supervisor’s Instructional Diagnosis: Second Lesson 
Upon the second or follow-up visit the teacher was less nervous, 
and seemed very anxious to have the lesson observed, for she 
felt that she had in the meantime worked upon some of her 
standing problems. 
There had been much improvement on the part of the pupils 
in passing out materials, and the pupils had the spirit of 
codperation in the matter. The use made of the “captains” was 
a method worked out by the teacher. Few teachers use this 
method, however. 
Difficulties were illustrated by the teacher both at the board 
and at the pupils’ seats to show the units of motion involved in 
individual difficulties. Detailed explanations were also used by 
the teacher which indicated that she realized that pupils learn 
in different ways. 
The outstanding problems brought out by the supervisor in 
the first lesson and discussed in the first interview had been 
emphasized by the teacher. 
Opportunity was given in the interview to answer the questions 
and diseuss the problems mentioned by the teacher. The clocks 
were not working right so the‘time was shortened and only part 
of the lesson was given. 
VII. The Supervisor’s Interview 
Supervisor. Do you want to ask me anything about the lesson? 
Teacher [hesitating]. Well... 
Supervisor. I noticed the passing of material was done in about 
half the time that it took in the previous lesson. 
Teacher. Yes, I am trying to work that out better. The time 
is so short for the lesson that I need to have the work well 
organized. 
Supervisor. I think you use good judgment between the indi- 
vidual and the group work. I am wondering now if it would 
help them to give them a test for the purpose of showing 
them their progress at this time. Did you give them an 
initial test? 
Teacher. Yes, I did. I have put the scales on the board showing 
the children how many write a quality of 50, 60, ete. 
Supervisor. That is fine. Tell them that the standard of 50 
is within the reach of everybody in the room, but that is just 
being inside the door. Try to come into the room. [This
-P-A-G-E-266
  248 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
is done to develop the various abilities since many are able 
to exceed the standard.] 
Teacher. I write the names of those who are good writers on 
the board. 
Supervisor. Give those who have made just a little progress 
eredit too. Get codperation from every one. 
Teacher. In the fifth grade I have them study the score ecards 
at times. [The score cards aim to make careful use of 
figures, neat arrangement, and are an aid to determine rate 
of progress. | 
Supervisor. That is good. They can see what the score cards 
are really for. Once in a while have the children stand up 
and read their progress from the score cards: lesson one, so 
many trials; lesson two, so many, ete. 
Teacher. I have had the children discuss which lesson they had 
to stay the longest on. They show interest in those little 
things. 
Supervisor. Good. 
Teacher. I like teaching handwriting very well. I thought at 
first I could not get the pupils interested, but now I have 
no such difficulty. Something new and interesting is con- 
stantly coming up. 
Supervisor. Do you notice how they follow the laws of learn- 
ing? The children want to get the letters right. They ask 
for help. They feel a degree of satisfaction when they get 
the letters right, and then want to show their results to 
some one when they have succeeded. Your success in getting 
the pupils to want to write well has brought this about. 
Isn’t it interesting?

Pupil. What date is to-day? 
Teacher. This is the twenty-first. [The teacher goes around 
the room looking at the children’s writing materials.] 
Pupil. Are we going to have a test to-day? 
Teacher. We are going to have both practice and test. [The 
pupils start practicing, and the teacher and the supervisor 
go about the room looking at the pupils’ work.] 
Teacher. Do not fix your test papers yet, boys and girls. Go 
on with your practicing, and we will have the test later. 
Teacher [to one pupil]. All right, that looks very nice. What 
size should your w be? 
Supervisor. How many are on the old lesson? [Several pupils 
raise hands.] What was wrong? [Several pupils tell diffi- 
eulty.] Make your capital letters almost a space high. 
Does that help you? [Assistance is given to pupils. Pupil 
shows his paper to the teacher. ] 
| Teacher. That is better. I like it because it is taller. 
Teacher [to another pupil]. What is the matter with your g? 
Where should the g close? What is the matter with the top? 
Pupil. It is open. 
Teacher. Yes, it is open at the top. 
Supervisor [to pupil]. Are you working on a new lesson this 
morning? I like the way you are working it out. [The 
supervisor goes to different pupils and helps them.] 
Teacher. Slant your book the same way your paper is, then 
you can see better. [A pupil shows his paper to the teacher.] 
Teacher. I like this ur and this S. [Pupils come up to the 
teacher with their papers.] 
Teacher. You raise your hands, boys and girls, and I will come 
to you. = 
Teacher. Doesn’t that b look nice, now? Did you see the first b 
she made? This one is so much nicer. That is because she 
studied it. [The supervisor helps several pupils.] 
Supervisor. Did you fix these S’s, Sam? 
Sam. Yes, ma’am. 
Supervisor. They look much better now. 
Pupil. How do you spell birthday? 
Teacher. Look in your book, Anna. 
Teacher. Now get your papers ready for the test. [The chil- 
dren quickly get their papers ready for the test.]

Teacher. Stop. [The children stop work and raise hands. 
The teacher and the supervisor go to different pupils, look- 
ing at their work. The pupils go to the measuring scale 
on the board and score their own work for quality.] 
Teacher. Captains, collect the papers. Boys and girls, you must 
not be so noisy. We are making too much noise. We can 
do this more quietly. 
Supervisor. I want to ask how many passed the lesson this 
morning? All children who passed the lesson raise their 
hands. [Pupils respond.] 
Teacher. Get our desks ready to pass. [The supervisor looks 
over the papers. ] 
Supervisor. Where is Mary Alice? Will she please come here 
just a minute? [Mary Alice comes to the front of the room, 
and the supervisor shows her the mistakes on her paper.

class.] c 
Teacher, First row stand. [The children pass.] 
IX. The Supervisor’s Instructional Diagnosis: Third Lesson 
Upon the two previous visits a few definite problems to be 
worked upon by the teacher were stressed, the idea being to 
emphasize one or two difficulties at a time. 
During the third visit the lesson was checked by items listed 
in the “Items to Observe” in a regular day’s lesson, for the pur- 
pose of checking the degree in which the teacher had developed 
the entire lesson. 
This was talked over with the teacher. At the end of the 
interview she asked if she might have the items checked, saying 
she thought it would help her in all her classes. 
X. The Supervisor’s Interview 
Supervisor. Let us talk over the entire lesson. 
Teacher. The children seemed to be excited because they were 
switched from one lesson to another. They were going to 
write a Safety-First Letter to-day instead of having the 
regular lesson. [The children were to copy a letter empha-
-P-A-G-E-269
PLANNING FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES 251 
sizing safety regulations. These letters were to be taken 
home to the parents during Safety Week.] 
Supervisor. Do the pupils enter into the writing lesson whole- 
heartedly, and seem anxious to improve their writing? 
[The supervisor uses a check list as a summary of good 
teaching procedure (see “Items to Observe” following re- 
port of interview).] 
Teacher. Yes, they seem to. 
Supervisor. I questioned a number of those children, and they 
knew what they were working on. 
Was the writing material put away ready for instant use? 
Yes. 
Is the material handled quickly and in orderly manner? 
Yes, it was. In repeating a lesson do the pupils who have 
their test papers of the previous day try to determine the 
reason for failure, then try to overcome the difficulty by 
using the technique of study? 
Teacher. The papers were discussed at the close of the previous 
lesson. 
Supervisor. Do the pupils sit in a comfortable, healthful 
position? 
Teacher. Yes, many do, but not all. That is one thing I feel 
that I have not accomplished. I am working on this problem. 
Supervisor. Do the pupils ask for specific help? Yes. If the 
pupils do not, does the teacher see that difficulties are being 
overcome and improvement is being made by the practice? 
Yes. 
Supervisor. Do the pupils know the rate for the various lessons 
and their relationship to the standard quality for the grade? 
Yes. 
Supervisor. Appraisal of practice work. Most children had an 
idea of how well it should be done. 
Supervisor. Do the pupils have a purpose in taking the test as 
is shown by the spirit with which they respond when the 
opportunity is given for a test? 
Teacher. They seemed to feel the change in the lesson, but eae 
were eager to take the test. 
Supervisor. Have them feel that the test was just another form 
of practice. 
Supervisor. Is an opportunity given to those who are not ready 
to take the test to continue practice? 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
  252 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Teacher. I often ask them if they would like to continue prac- 
ticing, and allow them to do so if they wish to. 
Supervisor. Do pupils head their papers in orderly manner 
without assistance? 
Teacher. I am not satisfied with the way they are doing this, 
and I have been trying to improve this phase of the work. 
Supervisor. Their self-control was good. They talked a little, 
but not enough to bother. 
Supervisor. Achievement. Do a number of pupils pass a lesson 
each day? 
Teacher. Twenty-eight out of thirty-seven passed the lesson 
to-day. 
Supervisor. Do the pupils score their papers with a degree of 
accuracy? Let’s look over these papers, and see whether 
they are scored accurately. If they vary five points it does 
not matter, but if they vary ten or more we must develop 
their judgment. This one is not marked high enough. 
This one is marked a little too high. Nine of these are scored 
too high and two too low. 
Supervisor. Do the pupils keep their record cards in an orderly 
manner? 
Teacher. I was going to ask you about the record cards. Is 
there any objection to the children in the lower grades keep- 
ing their score cards with pencil? 
Supervisor. That is all right. 
Care of the material. Is the writing material put awayr 
in good shape ready for the next day’s lesson? 
Teacher. Yes, it was. 
Supervisor. If you get this unit worked out [referring to method 
involved in “Items to Be Observed], you have gone a long 
way. Use the table in your manual, and compare your 
progress with others in your city. You can do that with 
any of the classes. [Shows the teacher how to use the table 
in the manual.] 
Teacher. We have our final tests next week. 
Supervisor. I would advise that you make use of the tests so 
the pupils can find out what progress they have made in 
their work. 
Teacher. It is interesting to see some of the first lessons they 
have written, and compare them with some of their present 
work.

XI. Items to Observe: Explanation 
Handwriting Lesson, Grades 3B-3A 
In general, each day’s work may be divided into three parts. 
Below are given the outstanding items that should be emphasized 
in each division, and the order of procedure. 
In the third and fourth grades it is suggested that at the 
beginning of the term the “Special Practice Period” be given 
one day, the test the second day, and the “Scoring and Recording 
of Results” the third day, so that the pupils will become familiar 
with materials and technique. As soon as pupils become used 
to this procedure, the tests may be given more frequently.

XII. The Teacher’s Reaction to Interview 
The supervisor of handwriting made three visits in my fourth- 
grade handwriting classes. I consider each visit was enjoyable 
and helpful because of the fact that she found the good points in 
the lessons first, and then in a very tactful manner offered her 
criticisms which helped to increase my ability and interest. 
She observed that a great many children were having trouble 
with position. In order to correct this she gave as an illustration 
a boy on roller skates. While learning to skate he leans over, 
but when he has learned, he can skate standing straight. The 
children do not like to feel they are just learning to write, and 
will try to hold their bodies straight. By giving this illustration 
neither the pupils nor myself felt that we were being criticized. 
Since the supervisor’s interview I have tried to give my 
criticisms to the children in the manner in which she gave them 
to me, and I find they are more beneficial. 
To me a supervisor’s visit should have a threefold purpose: 
(1) To find some good in the teacher’s work; (2) to remedy her 
mistakes, and (3) to form a closer tie between the supervisor 
and the teacher so that they may work together harmoniously | 
for the improvement of instruction. 
XIII. Critical Analysis of the Supervisory Procedure 
It is not always wise or possible to complete all that 
needs to be said in one visit. Teachers, being human, 
when loaded with all of their shortcomings at once, 
become discouraged, and fail because of this. Further- 
more, from the standpoint of improving instruction, it 
is not possible to retain in mind any considerable num- 
ber of facts at any one time. The teacher here inter- 
viewed is a typical, successful instructor with certain 
imperfections in technique. Through a series of three 
conferences she has been given actual assistance. The 
conference might have covered a semester, or even an 
entire year, but the purpose was accomplished in the 
three visits made.

PRETEACHING CONFERENCES 
In the preceding chapters the supervisory conference 
was considered primarily from the point of view of 
after-visiting interviews. The recitation was visited, and 
the conference followed. But much effective supervision 
ean be done by the before-visiting conference. This is 
particularly true of work done with student teachers and 
with inexperienced teachers in the teaching corps. In 
this chapter we shall take up briefly methods of making 
conferences before teaching more effective: 
Conferences on specific techniques. There are two types 
of preteaching conferences: jirs®& the conference dealing 
with specific teaching techniques; and, second, the con- 
ference dealing with specific lessons. An excellent pro- 
cedure to follow in stimulating discussion of specifie 
teaching techniques is to place in the hands of the teacher 
a set of standards for judging and improving the quality 
of elementary-school teaching. In this connection review 
again the ‘‘Items to Observe’? in Chapter II. Several 
conference periods, for example, might very profitably be 
spent in a discussion of the characteristics of good teach- 
ing. The organization and sequence of such conferences 
is similar to the procedure for follow-up work discussed 
in the preceding chapter, and need not be discussed here. 
The second type,of preteaching conferences—dealing with 
a specific lesson—will be discussed somewhat more at length 
in the following pages.

PRETEACHING ‘CONFERENCES 261 - 
Conferences on specific lessons. Assisting teachers to 
make detailed lesson plans is one of the most important 
means of helping teachers to better teaching. Based upon 
the knowledge of the learning process, there are certain 
teaching procedures that need to be mastered. One of 
the surest means of accomplishing this end is to plan 
conscientiously, for it. Too much time is lost, even among 
experienced teachers, in trial and error methods of teach- 
ing. The principal, supervisor, or critic can save. many 
a teaching disaster by careful preteaching planning. i 
ea pcaing as antecedent performance. In dis- 
cussing experience and the place of ideas in work, Bobbitt; 
in speaking of the organization of shop work, stresses the 
importance of planning in learning. He writes as fol- 
lows: + i 
The practical performance of any task divides itself naturally — 
into two parts. First, there is the planning of the work: making 
decisions as to exact objectives.and as to the specific materials 
and processes to be employed. This task involves performance 
in imagination of the entire labor from incipiency to finished 
product. It involves marshaling all one’s science relative to both, 
objectives and processes; and drawing plans as dictated by the 
science. One must also test_out in imagination cach step in the 
series to see that everything fits into everything else, and that 
there is no contradiction, interference, or other obstacles. i 
Any complete task will serve to illustrate. Let us take the case 
of the boy in the machine shop who sets out to construct a gas, 
engine. He first constructs it in his imagination. This ante- 
eedent construction involves all of the parts, sizes, designs, and’ 
relations. In this way, without any risk or waste of materials, 
he may construct it over and over again, to see that there are 
no mistakes, no interference of parts, and no insurmountable 
difficulties. He may construct it in many ways, using different’ 
designs, sizes of parts, or proportions; and he may test out each? 
design in order to determine the working plan that seems best. 
For these antecedent labors, he must mobilize all of his science,,

and put it to work both in ‘he planning and the testing. His 
thought may be concentrated into a few hours or distributed over 
months. But when this antecedent construction and testing are 
satisfactorily accomplished and decision made, the more funda- 
/mental portion of the work is done. 
Lesson-planning clarifies the thinking of beginning 
teachers. In speaking of the value of lesson plans, Nutt 
emphasizes the importance of planning as a means to 
clear thinking: ? 
Finally, then, one may say that making detailed lesson plans 
clarifies one’s thinking, and gives a perspective, of teaching prob=~~ 
Jems that cannot be got in any other way. ‘One must get away 
from the generalities of pedagogical principles, and. get down 
to the specific details of actual procedure if he is to make any 
progress in becoming skilled and efficient in conducting the 
recitation. )A comprehension of general laws and principles is 
essential, but specific applications or exhibitions of these laws 
in particular acts, in the teaching of particular lessons, is the 
only process by which the teaching performance can be refined 
and rendered effective. The teacher who thinks in broad, general 
terms of pedagogy in planning a lesson will not discriminate 
sharply between the essentials and the nonessentials. Such a 
teacher may keep in the general direction, and may make a good 
deal of a show of the recitation performance, but he never knows 
surely and accurately when he has arrived. On the other hand, 
the teacher who commits his pedagogical ideals to definite subject- 
matter form, to definite forms of devices, and to systematic 
technique, will know quite accurately when he has accomplished 
a specific piece of work. . 
‘\ Daily and weekly lesson plans. There are two types 
of lesson plans: (1) the detailed, daily lesson plans usu- 
ally required of inexperienced teachers and student teach- 
ers in training institutions; and (2) the weekly lesson 
4 plan, suited more particularly to larger units of work 
‘and more experienced teachers. Weekly lesson plans, in .

consist of a statement of the topic, problem, or project 
about which the work is organized, with subtopics indi-

Teaching lesson-planning. Strayer, in A Brief Course 
in the Teaching Process, has summarized in an outline 
form the steps by which the principal, supervisor, or 
critic may lead inexperienced teachers and_ student 
teachers in training institutions to a realization of the 
importance of lesson-planning, and to a knowledge of 
the elements that enter into its composition. The out- 
line was designed primarily with the daily lesson plan 
in mind:* 
A plan for teaching lesson plans: Their importance andthe 
elements which enter into their composition, 
Teacher’s Aim: To show the importance of plan-making, and 
to indicate the elements that enter into the construction of a good 
plan. 
Preparation (which aims to get the problem before the class). 
How do you prepare for your day’s work? Do’ you think you 
would do better if you planned your several recitations somewhat 
systematically ? .

MeztHop oF PROCEDURE 
Do you ever grow tired of 
teaching the same subject over 
and over again? 
Why does a sermon out of the 
*‘barrel’’? lack in interest or 
power to inspire? 
Do you know a subject thor- 
oughly to-day because you once 
studied it? 
Why do different groups of 
children respond differently to 
the same material? 
Formulate three good ques- 
tions that you might use in teach- 
ing a lesson on the oak tree to 
second-grade children. 
Do you think you might have 
asked better questions if you had 
had time to think them over? 
What picture or other illus- 
trative material would you use in 
teaching this lesson? 
Do you think the children 
would gain by drawing a picture 
of the oak near by? 
When do you think you will 
have enough experience in teach- 
ing to be able to get along 
without making plans? 
[The questions in this part of 
the plan will be few. I should 
expect questions, suggestions, and 
discussions on the part of the 
class. I should probably use the 
blackboard to show the organiza- 
tion of subject matter as given 
under subject matter.]

Lesson Puans ror STupy, 
In the first section of this chapter a procedure for 
preteaching conferences has been given at some length. 
It is the purpose of this part of the chapter to repro- 
duce some concrete materials in the form of lesson plans. 
Principals and supervisors should not expect experienced 
teachers to develop such detailed plans, but inexperienced 
teachers and student teachers can profit greatly by care- 
ful paper planning before teaching. It should be empha- 
sized that the plans are not models but typical of the 
materials that principals, supervisors, and critics may 
expect of teachers.® 
1. Primary Progecr: “Puayina Storn’* 
Motivation. Children brought toys to school which had been 
received at Christmas. Interest centered in an Erector set and 
made all anxious to show their ability to make things. Then 
arose the question, “What kind of things?” “Toys.” “What 
shall we do with them?” “Play Store.” 
“What kind of store?” “The Brayton 5 and 10 Cent Store.” 
(From the name of the school.) 
“What signs shall we need?” 
“THE BRAYTON STORE; SPECIAL SALES; BARGAIN 
DAY; Price tags.” One child suggested printing them with the 
school printing press, so he took charge of the signs. 
“What toys or articles shall we make for sale?” 
The children suggested the following list: Kites, airplanes, 
trains of cars, sailboats, wheelbarrows, furniture, blocks with 
alphabet, rocking-horses, ducks, animals in barn, toy money, 
purses, drums, dolls, doll’s clothes, tin pails, rakes, hoes, spades, 
shovels, balls, rattles, combs, brushes, cups, saucers, hair ribbons, 
beads, telephones.

or A RULE 
Subject Matter 
Teacher’s Aim 
General: To teach fractions. 
Specific: The reduction of fractions to lower terms. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge: Children have used fractions and know the 
general terminology used. 
New Knowledge: They will learn that fractions may be re- 
duced to lower terms by dividing both terms by the same 
number. 
Sources and References 
Any standard arithmetic. 
Method 
[The lesson opens with a brief review of known terms, the 
children defining fraction, terms of the fraction, numerator, and 
denominator. ] 
“T have in my hand $1.00. How many cents in a dollar? 
Here is one cent. What part of a dollar is it? (14 99.) Then if 
one cent is 4499 of a dollar, how many hundredths in this fifty- 
cent piece? (5% 9 9.) [Writes this on board.] What do we 
usually call a fifty-cent piece, instead of 5% 9? (Half a 
dollar.) [On board, 5% 99 = %.] 
[Repeats for twenty-five cents, writing on board, 2549) = %4.] 
“We do not usually speak of fifty cents as 5% 99, or of twenty- 
five cents as 25499. Why? (Because one-half and one-quarter 
are easier.) Why easier? (Because the terms used are smaller.) 
Yes, we say that the fraction is in lower terms. Although the 
two fractions in each case [pointing to board] look quite different, 
you know that their value is the same. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
PRETEACHING CONFERENCES . 277 
“Which do you think would be the easier for us to use in our 
work in fractions, large or small fractions, those in higher or 
lower terms?” 
Pupil’s Aim. “To-day we are going to learn how to change or 
reduce fractions to lower terms.” [Drill on this.] 
QD) D&S &B Presentation. ‘Look at the circles and help me mark the parts. 
Into how many equal parts is the first circle divided? What, 
then, shall we call each part?” [Marks it 44. Repeats for other 
circles until all are marked as above.] 
“Let us see if we can find how many halves in four eighths.” 
[Children refer to proper figures, and teacher writes their answer 
on board, 4% = %.] 
[Follows the same process until the teacher has the following 
list on the board.] 
4~% 4 =¥ % = 5 ho=¥ 
“Look at this figure:” 
  “Into how many equal parts is it divided?” [Teacher writes 44 
at the side of each division.] 
[Then with colored chalk she divides it as below:] 
   
-P-A-G-E-296
  278 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
  “How many equal parts now?” [Writes 145 as children 
give it.] 
[With another colored chalk the figure is divided again and 
the small part marked 144; the colored lines should keep children 
from becoming confused, but if not, the teacher may use simpler 
figures. ] 
  [Then, proceeding as with the circles, the teacher gets from 
the children the following equivalent fractions, adding them to 
the first list :] 
aaa/s 42= % 
i= 1s = 
“Now, class, look back to the statement, 44 = 14. How do we 
know that the two fractions are equal? (Because they represent 
the same amount of space on two equal figures.) But can we 
always draw figures and compare spaces when we wish to know 
if fractions are of the same value or not? What must we do? 
Who can see another way to get 4 when % is given?” [Some 
pupil may know how to do this, or some bright one may see it 
quickly, but the majority will not, since this is a new process to 
them. The teacher must therefore lead dogmatically for a
-P-A-G-E-297

moment.] “By what must I divide 4 to get 1? Hight to get 2?” 
[Writes on board :]

[Proceeds in the same way with the rest of the list until she 
has the following on the board :] 
Ao=*# Tt 4+ 4=-% 4-H“ 4~=% Ra Ol Ho ae ei or OR 26 Ue 
21-8 str %- Rh Ahr ~~ % 
“Tf we had no figures to refer to, who could prove to me that 
4% still equals 44, even though we have divided the terms by other 
numbers?” [Some will see that the divisor in each case equals 1, 
or the teacher may lead them to note that fact. They know, of 
course, that numbers divided by one remain of the same value.] 
Comparison and Generalization. “Look back over all these 
fractions and tell me what we did each time.” [Teacher should 
probably take most of the individual cases and get the statement 
- each time that both numerator and denominator were divided 
by 2, 4, 6, or 5, as the case may be. The class should finally be 
guided to make the statement that in each case the terms of the 
fraction were divided by the same number, with the result that 
the larger fraction was made into a smaller one, or reduced to 
lower terms.]

3. Report or A History-Civics Lesson Inuustratine Review 
This lesson illustrates a good type of review in which old facts 
are recalled and used to teach a new definition. 
Subject Matter 
Teacher’s Aim 
General: To teach the United*States Constitution. 
Specific: To teach the definition of treason from the constitu- 
tion by means of reviewing the following circumstances: 
(1) Arnold’s treachery, (2) Charles Lee’s disobedience, (3) 
Aaron Burr’s conspiracy. 
Analysis of the Aim. 
Old Knowledge: The following paragraphs summarize the 
facts the pupils know about each case: 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
    280 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
1. Benedict Arnold won a reputation for bravery and skill in 
the Revolutionary War, but because of some irregularity in his 
life at Philadelphia, he was court-martialed and punished by 
being reprimanded by Washington. Later he was given command 
of West Point, and in a spirit of revenge began negotiations 
with Clinton for surrendering the plans of this fort to the enemy. 
The plot became known, and though Arnold escaped, his accom- 
plice, Major André, was captured, convicted on the testi- 
mony of three men, and hanged. Arnold fled to England 
but was despised by the English and remained an outcast all 
his life. 
2. Part of Washington’s army was under Charles Lee. On 
one occasion Lee was ordered to join Washington and refused, 
causing Washington to retreat or be captured. Again, when 
Washington was about to win a victory at Monmouth, Lee ordered 
a retreat, resulting in a defeat and rout. He was ordered to 
the rear, later court-martialed, and dismissed from the army. 
He was not convicted because of lack of evidence but suffered 
discharge from the army and disgrace in the eyes of his country- 
men. Papers were found eighty years later that would have 
convicted him. 
3. Aaron Burr was Vice-President during Jefferson’s adminis- 
tration and was a man of wealth and influence. He fought a 
duel with Alexander Hamilton, killing him, thereby losing much 
of his popularity and position. He fied to New Orleans for 
safety and there organized a military expedition that was to form 
a new government in the Southwest. Such a plan would have 
threatened the Union and was, therefore, regarded as disloyal. 
Aaron Burr was tried in court but was not convicted for lack 
of evidence. His disgrace was now complete. [Some of the later 
histories state that no one really knows what Burr was going to 
do and that he may have had no disloyal intentions. Pupils 
should discuss the conflicting evidence if it is found in their 
books. ] '

Method 
“Some time ago you learned a selection beginning: 
‘Breathes there a man with soul so dead,’ 
“T see you recall it. Who will repeat it for the class? Who 
is the author? What is the sentiment expressed? (Patriotism.) 
Rather the need for patriotism. Do you remember another author 
who was inspired by this stanza and based a story on the theme? 
(Hale, The Man Without a Country.) Who will give a very 
brief synopsis of this story? Does the story suggest any parallel 
case in history, that is, of a man turning against his country for 
a seeming wrong done him and then of his regret for his dis- 
loyalty?” [Pupils mention Benedict Arnold, Charles Lee, and 
Aaron Burr.] 
Pupil’s Aim. “To-day we will examine the cases of Arnold, 
Lee, and Burr to see wherein these men were disloyal.” 
Presentation. [In answer to questions from the teacher, the 
pupils state the principal points in the three cases, much as 
outlined above on the subject-matter side of this plan. The 
following summary was then organized on the board.] 
BENEDICT ARNOLD 
1. Offense. Aiding the enemy. 
2. Result. Found out and fled to England. Could have been 
convicted, as there were witnesses and evidence. 
8. Fate. An outcast from his own country. Scorned by many of 
the English. Died in poverty in England. 
CHARLES Lez 
1. Offense. Aiding the enemy. wy 
2. Result. Coeurt-martialed, but escaped conviction because of lack 
of evidence. 
3. Fate. Dismissed and disgraced. 
AARon BuRR 
1. Offense. Attempted to levy war. 
2. Result. Tried but not convicted because of lack of evidence. 
3. Fate. Lost high position, disgraced, and shunned. . 
Comparison and Generalization. “Make a statement showing 
wherein these cases were alike.. [Boil down to something like the 
following, ‘All aided the enemy or levied war, all were found 
out, and all suffered punishment.’]

“Now I am going to give you a word that means the commis- 
sion of these two crimes against one’s country. It is ‘treason.’ 
[Word is known, of course, in general but not exactly.] Define 
treason in terms of the cases studied. (Treason consists in aiding 
the enemy or levying war on one’s country.) 
“You say that all these men were punished. Do you mean 
legally punished? (No, they escaped because of lack of evidence 
and witnesses. In one case by flight.) Do you think we should 
insist on witnesses and complete evidence in the case of such a 
serious crime? [Some may think not, having their minds on the 
act against the country. Others will see that because of the 
seriousness it is well to insist on such safeguards. If they do 
not see it, teacher can easily develop.] 
“What else shows this to be a serious crime? (The way in 
which every one scorned those suspected, even when not con- 
wicted.) 
“What do you think should be the punishment? [Most of 
elass will probably say ‘death.’] 
“Open your books and read Section III of Article III of the 
Constitution and see if our idea of treason is correct. Wherein 
were we right? (In the type of offenses included, and in insist- 
ing on witnesses and evidence.) Wherein do we differ?” (In 
the kind of punishment.) [Teacher will have to explain carefully 
the phrases, ‘attainder of treason’ and ‘corruption of blood,’ 
which are contained in the section. ] 
4. A GrocrapHy Lesson Innustratine THE PropLem-SOLVING 
Process 
The subject-matter side is written out in some detail to illus- 
trate how the brief summary in the usual textbook must be 
supplemented. Good geography teaching necessitates much 
use of encyclopedias, bulletins, magazines, books, photographs, 
ete. 
It should be emphasized here that teachers do not ordinarily 
write out such detailed summaries of material. A few notes will 
usually serve to keep it in mind. However, if a teacher is con- 
sistently careless about preparing material, or is frequently at 
a loss for information while before her class, the supervisor must 
then insist on a few such detailed summaries until the difficulty 
is overcome.  
-P-A-G-E-301

Subject Matter 
Teacher’s Aim 
General: To teach the South American countries. 
Specific: To teach Paraguay. 
Analysis of the Aim 
Old Knowledge. Information about zone boundaries, wind 
system, rainfall distribution, ete. 
New Knowledge. The following is the content of the lesson: 
1. Location. Paraguay is an inland country lying between 22 
and 27 degrees south latitude, and bordered by Bolivia, Brazil, 
and Argentina. 
2. Surface. The surface is rolling and hilly, varying in alti- 
tude from 200 feet to a few ranges of 1,500 feet. The soil is 
very rich. The Paraguay River passes almost through the middle 
| of the country from north to south, joining the Parana River 
at the southern boundary. It has numerous important tributaries, 
and there are many other small streams and creeks, some of which 
broaden out into impenetrable swamps. 
3. Climate. It has a tropical climate. Roughly the country 
lies in the horse latitudes in fall and spring, there being little 
rain during those times. During the summer (our winter) it 
would lie in the Southeast Trade Wind Belt, and thus have con- 
siderable rain. In the winter (our summer) it would be in the 
path of the prevailing westerlies and there would be little rain. 
4. Vegetation. The country is highly favored by nature as a 
productive region. On the hillsides of the eastern part of the 
country there are dense forests containing over one hundred 
kinds of trees. These forests cover about one-half the total area. 
Much very valuable timber is cut, and many essences, oils, spices, 
and barks are also obtained. The western part is a broad 
meadow-land where hay and grain are raised and where there is 
much pasturage. 
Orange trees grow wild in the forests. Yerba maté is also a 
natural product growing without cultivation in the forest. 
5. Products. The forest produces: dye-woods, valuable timber, 
gums, indigo, India rubber, oranges, tannin, medicines, yerba 
maté. The cultivated products are: sugar-cane, tobacco, rice, 
mandioca, maize and corn, cotton of a very superior kind, grapes, 
oranges. Products of the meadows and pastures: hay and grain, 
eattle, horses, meats, ete. There are practically no mineral
-P-A-G-E-302
284 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
products at present but late reports indicate considerable mineral 
wealth in the country. 
6. Industries. A long series of wars, together with the poor 
type of labor available, has greatly hampered industry. 
(a) Herding. Cattle-raising is the leading industry and while 
it brings in much wealth now, it is capable of great development 
when transportation facilities are bettered and when refrigera- 
tion and packing plants are established. American capital is 
engaged in.the latter enterprise. 
(b) Agriculture. The government is encouraging agriculture 
to the best of its ability. It is also attracting colonists, and 
several new settlements have been established with people from 
Europe and Australia. 
Much more cotton would be raised if there was a better labor 
supply and if there were factories near by. Foreign freight 
rates are also very high. 
Conditions are ideal for the production of much rice, by means 
of irrigation. The government is interested and is importing 
Japanese experts to study the problem. At present much rice is 
imported. Lumbering is extensive and brings in much wealth. 
Tobacco is exported to Argentina and to Europe. The govern- 
ment is also encouraging this industry, which suffered much from 
the wars. 
(ec) Manufacturing is somewhat undeveloped. Much of it is 
the preparation of raw material for shipment to factories in 
foreign countries. There is manufacture of oils, essences, soap, 
spirits, cigars, brick and earthenware, some furniture, lace- 
making (a remnant of Spanish days). 
(d) Transportation and Commerce. There is a good harbor 
for river boats at Asuncion. Light boats can go up the tribu- 
taries also. 
There are four important wagon roads from the interior to 
Asuncion, and some miles of railroad, the most important being 
that between Asuncion and Montevideo. 
The chief exports are the things mentioned above under 
products and those in this section under industries. 
Imports consist of clothing, machinery, cutlery, tools, 
arms, ete. 
7. Cities. Asuncion is the principal city and need not be 
taught in detail, since some other more important South Ameri- 
can city should be presented in detail as a type. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  
PRETEACHING CONFERENCES 285 
8. People and Government. The people are Indians, Spanish, 
half-breeds, and a few Europeans. Their life, customs, costumes, 
etc., should be given in some little detail through reading. The 
government is of the usual South American republic type. 
Sources and References. Text, magazines, bulletins, pam- 
phlets, books of travel, encyclopedias, ete. 
Method 
Approach. “How many of you have had friends move away 
from here to make their home somewhere else? Did they go to 
another part of this country or to a foreign country? Did you 
hear them discuss why they left? What did they say? [Dis- 
cussion by class. Usual reasons will be lack of work, closing of 
mill or factory, father transferred to another office, climate does 
not agree with some of the family, to get better schools, 
etc., ete. ] 
“What did they say about the new place to which they were 
going? Why was it chosen? How did they find out about this 
place? [Let class give such discussion as they wish.] 
“Tf people were moving to a far-away foreign country they 
would have to be all the more particular in finding out about it. 
What are some of the things you or your parents would want 
to know about a country before going there? (Could we make 
a living? What businesses are carried on there? What kind of 
people would we have to live among? Is the country safe and 
healthful? Are there good schools? Is the climate favorable? 
ete., ete.) 
“Let us organize an outline of the topics upon which inquiry 
would be made.” [From informal discussion the teacher will 
organize on the board some such outline as the following.] 
Things to find out about a new country: 
Products Cities and Schools 
Industries Climate 
People Transportation 
Government [Others may be suggested] 
The list of topics may be organized on the board in any order, 
depending on the trend of class discussion. In teaching them, 
however, though there are several that might come first, a few 
should be studied in sequence. For instance, if the pupils decide 
to study products before climate and surface, they can be very 
easily led to see that the former depends upon the two latter.  
-P-A-G-E-304
  286 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
“Let us suppose we are going to move to Paraguay.” 
Pupils’ Aim. “Let us find out if Paraguay would be a good 
place to make a home.” 
Sub-Aim for Unit 1. “Let us see if Paraguay has a desirabl 
climate.” ‘ 
Inspection and Inference. “Step to the map and locate Para- 
guay for the class.” (It lies between 22 and 27 degrees south 
latitude, and is crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn.) What does 
that tell you? (That it lies partly in the Torrid and partly in 
the South Temperate Zone, and, other things being equal, it would 
have a tropical climate.) 
“What other facts can you tell from the latitude in regard to 
the climate?” (That in the fall and spring the country will lie 
in the horse latitudes and that there will be little rain.) 
“What else? (That in their summer it would lie in the belt 
of the southeast trade winds and would therefore have consider- 
able rainfall.) There is another fact you must know before you 
ean tell how much rain these winds would give to the country. 
(The surface features.) Turn to the relief map and see if you 
can tell how the surface affects the rainfall. (The land rises 
gradually toward the north, which means that the winds gradually 
rising would distribute considerable rain over the country.) 
There is still another fact in this case that will affect the amount 
of rainfall. Who sees? (Paraguay is not next the sea. The 
breezes must pass over part of Brazil first and would thus have 
less moisture to bring to Paraguay.) 
“What would be the conditions during the winter? (Zhe winds 
would be the prevailing westerlies and there would be little rain.) 
“In addition to regulating the rain, these winds would affect 
the temperature. How?” [Let class tell as above how each wind 
would affect the temperature. ] 
“Let us then summarize what we have found out about the 
climate of Paraguay.” [Some such paragraph as the following: 
Paraguay has in general a tropical climate, warm even in winter. 
It is an inland country with no direct sea breezes but deriving 
considerable benefit from those that reach there after crossing 
part of Brazil. Greatest rainfall during their summer, from 
October to May. Less rainfall in winter.] 
Verification. “Open your books to pages — to — and also 
to the rainfall, wind, and relief maps and see if we are right 
about this. See if we have overlooked anything.” [There has
-P-A-G-E-305
  PRETEACHING CONFERENCES 287 
been some verification, of course, during the lesson by means of 
syllogistie proof and through the O.K. of the teacher placed upon 
certain statements. ] 
“What were we to find out to-day? (If Paraguay has a 
desirable climate.) Do you think it has? Would you like to 
live there as far as the climate is concerned?” [Some will, and 
others will not.] 
* * * * 
“What is the problem on which we are working? (To see if 
Paraguay would be a good place in which to make a home.) How 
much of this problem have we worked out? (We have found 
that the climate of Paraguay would be quite desirable to some 
people, while others might not like it.) Yes, and even with 
those who did not like the climate, there might be a reason for 
going to the country. What do you think it might be? (They 
could make a good living easily.) That is something every one 
would wish to know. Upon what would that depend? (What 
the people did there.) And what would that be determined by? 
- (The soil, the products, other natural resources, capital, etc., etc.) 
Sub-Aim for Unit 2, “Let us see if Paraguay has many valu- 
able products. 
Inspection and Inference. [Recall facts in regard to surface 
and climate.] “What would you expect to find in the heavily 
watered, hilly region to the east? (Forests.) That is right. 
How would they differ from our forests? (Very dense and would 
have different trees.) [If the class knows the general nature of 
tropical forests, let them infer the kinds of trees. Otherwise 
open books and read. Teacher will list the forest products on 
the board: Hard woods, dye-woods, India rubber, gums, indigo, 
yerba maté, wild oranges. She must explain about the last two.) 
“What else is often found in hilly or mountainous regions? 
(Minerals.) [Little is said in geographies about this, and teacher 
will have to tell that although there are few mineral products as 
yet, late reports indicate some mineral wealth.] 
“What is the nature of the western part of Paraguay? 
(Valleys, broad meadows, and some swamps.) Would those 
valleys be likely to have rich soil? (Yes, the heavy tropical 
vegetation would have built it up and the many rivers and streams 
would have brought more from the hills.) What then might be 
the nature of the products? (Hay and grain, sugar cane,
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
tobacco, rice, mandioca, maize, cotton, etc.) [Teacher lists them 
on the board and the class verifies by looking in the book.] 
“There is another use to which valley and meadowland is often 
put. (Raising cattle and horses.) Yes, that is one of the biggest 
industries of the country.” 
Verification. “Look at this list of products on the board. 
Open your books to page —, and some of you may use these 
geographical readers, pages — to —. Read to see if we have 
any products listed which are not mentioned in the books. Also 
if we have omitted any. 
“What is our problem again? (To see if Paraguay would be 
a good place in which to make a home.) What bearing does 
to-day’s lesson have on this? (We were to find out the products 
of Paraguay in order to see if they would provide an oppor- 
tunity to make a living.) Do you think these products would 
provide enough industries so that most people could find work 
suited to them?” (Probably so.) “That will be our aim then, 
for to-morrow.” 
Sub-Aim for Unit 3. “We shall find out what industries there 
are in Paraguay.” 
* * * * 
[The next unit on industries, others on commerce and trans- 
portation, the people and their customs, the government, etc., 
should be developed in much the same manner. 
In closing, a final summary should be made, summing up the 
points that would make Paraguay a good place in which to make 
a home, and those that would not be so favorable. ]

    CHAPTER X 
FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 
The study of the experiences of others helpful. In 
the discussions that preceded this chapter we laid down 
most of the fundamental principles that should govern 
the conference procedure. Many concrete situations were 
reported. For the most part, however, attention was 
focused upon the general principles of supervision to be 
derived from a study of such cases. But there arise in 
supervision many teaching problems, each presenting 
new and unsolved difficulties. In many ways each case 
is a law unto itself. ‘‘What to say’’ and ‘‘how to say 
it’’ will vary from situation to situation. In this sense 
each supervisory problem is individual. After years of 
experience one learns to place each new problem in its 
proper category and to proceed with reasonable assur- 
ance of success. It is only by trial and error processes, 
fraught with frequent failure and disappointment, that 
one evolves a working procedure. This process, however, 
ean be greatly shortened by the study of the experiences 
of others. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to bring together in 
concrete form the experiences of supervisors successful 
in dealing with difficult, everyday, supervisory problems. 
The cases reported are those that have actually arisen 
in the regular routine of school work, and the solutions 
are those judged to have succeeded. The cases have been 
gathered from supervisors of varied experience and from 
widely scattered localities. The material is of interest 
295  
-P-A-G-E-314
  296 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
not only because of the specific solutions suggested but 
also because of original data indicative of prevailing 
standards of supervision. The material may be taken 
prima facie and studied for whatever values it has in 
offering solutions to difficult problems in supervision, or 
it may be made the basis of a critical analysis of super- 
visory practices. Although the list of studies is not 
exhaustive, the studies are typical of those recurring in 
the average school system and should be suggestive to 
experienced and inexperienced supervisors alike.

Case. This case involves a very attractive twenty-year- 
old girl teaching her first school. She was graduated 
from a normal school and later from the state university. 
Her scholarship was average. At the opening of the 
school year she was assigned to an elementary school 
to fill a temporary vacancy made by the resignation of 
a failing teacher. She taught for one week (a difficult 
position), became ill, and was out of school until the 
first of October. On October 1 she was assigned to a 
permanent position as relief teacher in another elemen- 
tary school. She was given a scattered program, includ- 
ing literature, reading, and play classes. She failed. 
The children did everything imaginable. There was no 
attention. Every one talked at once. A common expres- 
sion among the children was, ‘‘I ain’t got that.’’ Books 
were thrown about the room. The teacher was colorless 
and lifeless. There was no planning or awareness of 
problems. She had very little to say, and had no interest 
in improvement. The central office was notified and the 
principal asked for her dismissal. 
A representative visited the teacher in November and 
a second representative December 4. The teacher was 
asked to come to the office for assistance. She did not

| FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 297 
come at once but did later. A visiting critic was sent 
out twice, who taught for her, discussed teaching pro- 
eedure, and suggested that she see the supervisor. This 
she did only after being repeatedly urged to do so. As 
a last resort the teacher was transferred to another ele- 
mentary school with a recommendation that she be dis- 
missed. 
Solution. In analyzing this case the following facts 
were brought out. The girl had met with a very grave 
personal disappointment during the last weeks at the 
university. Added to this came failure in certain subjects 
which were not completed until the summer term. Fur- 
thermore, this was her first position of responsibility, 
and she did not realize the dangers to be encountered in 
bridging the gap from training school to regular class- 
room teaching. 
The children were just those of good American homes, 
but the teacher was at a disadvantage because her prede- 
cessor had been of unusual merit. Unfortunately, the 
classroom was next door to the principal’s office. The 
teacher was always conscious of the fact that the prin- 
cipal could hear, and never felt quite free to speak to 
the pupils as she would have liked. The pupils slipped 
from her control the very first day. The principal did 
not give assistance and, as a matter of fact, did not 
appear until it was too late to help. The children even 
continued their festivities in the principal’s presence. 
The teacher did not feel that if the necessary steps were 
taken she was likely to get support from the principal, 
and she soon assumed an attitude of impertinence and 
disrespect for the principal. 
Then came the assignment to a new school. Before her 
arrival at the new school she held several conferences 
on her own initiative with the supervisor, first on Decem- 
ber 7 and second on January 11. Just before taking the

  298 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
new position, which was in a newly organized school, she 
and the supervisor planned a term’s work and then 
worked out one unit in detail. The supervisor explained 
how other teachers had difficulty and were now succeed- 
ing. The supervisor also discussed various types of les- 
sons while the teacher took notes. Several pamphlets were 
given to her to read. 
In her new position the teacher succeeded. When vis- 
ited by those who had known her in her previous posi- 
tion she was rated from ‘‘average’’ to ‘‘good.’? The new 
principal rated her ‘‘good.’’ The s supervisor upon vi visiting 
the room found 100 |-interest,-and 
no rder. osewho_know the teacher say that her 
facial expression has changed and interest in life is 
greater. At an April “ “‘Cadet meeting’’ she was literally 
on the very edge of her chair, and attracted attention by 
her alertness and whole-hearted participation in the meet- 
ing. She offered many excellent suggestions and was 
thoroughly alive in every respect. 
In looking for causes the girl told her own story. She 
was again in good health and there was no excellent 
teacher to follow. The pupils were from middle-class, 
foreign-born homes. On her arrival at the new school 
the principal remembered meeting her sister who was a 
very successful teacher, and dropped the remark that an 
official of the college had commended her leadership in 
college. She felt immediately that she was all right, 
probably there was some chance yet. The teachers of the 
building also displayed an excellent attitude toward the 
principal. They were also very considerate of those new 
to their school. ‘‘I just had to succeed,’’ said the teacher. 
The school, in moving from the old building to the new, 
was introducing a new administrative organization. The 
new teacher had experience (the others had not) in the 
new type of organization. She knew something that the
-P-A-G-E-317
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 299 
other teachers didn’t know and her services were wel- 
eomed. The teacher showed social leadership and later 
was given an opportunity to manage the social affairs of 
the school. 
The principal was very helpful and held a meeting 
every day during the first week of school to indicate 
danger and procedures. She was definite in explaining 
all assignments, details of organization, management of 
hall duty, room order, courtesy, promptness, ete. At the 
principal’s first visit to the room the teacher ‘‘froze up,’’ 
but not long. On the second visit the principal took the 
elass ‘‘tactfully’’ to tell a story that she had been read- 
ing. Incidentally what the principal did was to illustrate 
a principle of teaching. Without discussion the teacher 
got the point and was using the correct procedure on 
the third visit. The teacherthen-askedfor assistance in 
lesson-planning-—(Lesson-planning—had—been discussed in 
teachers’—meetings.) Help was given. The pri principal 
suggested that the long, cumbersome plans that the 
teacher had been taught to use in college be dropped, 
and that short, usable plans be introduced in their 
place. 
Gradually the teacher grew in courage and in skill. 
Recently the principal received a letter of appreciation 
from the girl’s mother. Kind, helpful, sympathetic super- 
vision had not been without its reward. 
2. Helping an Inexperienced Teacher 
Case. Some time ago an immature girl directly from 
college was assigned to my building as a B-first teacher. 
Despite the fact that the required amount of time was 
spent in training-and-that-she was by no -dull, 
she seemed <a ee the

She had the further advantage of a splendid heritage,
-P-A-G-E-318
300 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
as her mother was a brilliant woman and had been a 
teacher. 
‘When the busy days incident to the opening of school 
had passed, and an opportunity to help presented itself, 
disorder reigned supreme. It seemed impossible that the 
mechanics of the room could be reduced to such a chaotic 
condition in so short a space of time. 
Solution. The day that I visited the room the teacher 
was telling a story. Hoping to be of some assistance I 
sat down at her desk and quietly attempted to find the 
book containing the story. The desk was in a very dis- 
orderly condition, and the book was not in evidence. 
The same condition prevailed in the closet, and the 
teacher had not the slightest idea where to find the 
book. 
At the close of school, with my help, the desk and 
closet were reduced to an orderly condition. The next 
morning attention was centered upon the desks of the 
pupils, general appearance of the room, passing to class, 
returning to seats, and dismissal. 
Later, with the use of as many devices as possible and 
with the best technique at my command, the story was 
presented to an interested group. This was followed by 
the suggestion that the lack of interest exhibited when 
the story was told at first was due to imperfect plan- 
ning, to the fact that the story was told without ges- 
tures, change of expression or voice, without questions, 
or any of the numberless devices or points of technique 
that tend to hold the interest and attract the attention 
of little children. 
Results. As this teacher was very timid and easily 
discouraged, her training required an infinite amount of 
patience, tact, and sympathy. At the close of the school 
year I could conscientiously mark her a B teacher. At 
the present time her rating is B-plus.

3. Providing for Individual Differenc 
Case. When the principal visited the room, hé~found 
sixth-grade children reading orally a poem entirely tn- 
suited to the grade and type of children. _The teacher 
had a good record; in fact, she had been given a higher 
grade because of good work. The visit showed clearly 
that the teacher had no idea of the problems confront- 
ing her, no grasp of subject matter, no practical knowledge 
of adolescent children, neither had she any idea of the 
mechanics _of silent reading, nor any hold upon the 
situation. — ea 
Solution. The principal talked over the lesson with 
the teacher and the most salient features were discussed 
in an endeavor to cover each feature impersonally and 
constructively. Group work was suggested as a means of 
providing for individual differences. After two or three 
conferences on the subject of silent reading, the teacher 
was left for several days to find herself. Then the work 
in silent reading was again observed, and it was evident 
that the class had been divided into groups without rhyme 
or reason. Methods were again gone over, books on the 
teaching of silent reading were suggested for study, and 
several chapters discussed by principal and teacher to- 
gether. Plans were made to group the children on the 
basis of scores made in a reading test. The principal was 
present when the test was given, and assisted in dividing 
the group and in diagnosing individual cases. 
| An opportunity was given the teacher to visit a well 
organized silent-reading recitation taught by another 
sixth-grade teacher in the building. Supervision con- 
tinued at intervals. 
Result. Improvement is noticed. The teacher is 
growing in control of method, subject matter, and 
discipline.

4, Disciplinary Troubles 
Cas¢. An inexperienced teacher of music had some 
trouble with discipline in her school chorus. There were 
about 100 pupils, boys and girls, in the chorus. The 
teacher spent two or three minutes of each meeting in 
checking the roll. She also spent at least one minute 
after each song in choosing the next song. 
Solution. The principal suggested that some reliable 
student mark the attendance at each meeting, and that 
a definite program of songs be planned before the meet- 
ing started. These suggestions were followed and prac- 
tically all the disturbances stopped. 
ce When the pupils were kept busy, they did 
not think about getting into mischief. 
5. The Teacher Who Needed Supervision 
Case. A young normal-school graduate with two years 
of teaching experience in an inferior system came to 
teach the third grade in a very progressive school. She 
had really gone backward since graduation, and although 
she had been highly recommended, the superintendent 
was very much disappointed in his first visit to her room. 
The previous superintendent who cared little for class- 
room work gave her no help in her crucial years. 
Solution. The superintendent began by obtaining the | 
codperation and friendly feeling of the teacher. He made 
a few suggestions in a constructive way. Through con- 
tact with other teachers, demonstration teaching, and 
intervisitation, he awoke the desire in this young lady 
to improve. Then she asked the superintendent for help. 
This created an ideal supervisory situation and he helped 
her by advice, by suggesting professional reading, by 
studying concrete materials, ete. 
Results. The teacher rapidly became one of the best 
in the system.

6. The Supervisor Who Took Charge of the Class 
Case. In spite of the fact that the class was an un- 
usually good one and the teacher especially prepared for 
geography, the work started quite unsatisfactorily. The 
teacher’s plans—reatt —well;~the_class_was_organized~for 
socialized work, assignments were definite, but-there was 
no interest. Carelessty-given reports fell upon deaf ears. 
Listlessness_prevailed. The greatest difficulty lay in the 
fact that the inexperienced teacher didn’t sense the gen- 
eral Puan She was quite confident that everything 
was ‘‘as good as could, be expected.”’ Conferences. helped 
little. Suggestions for stimulation_and_lively class dis- 
eussion, I felt, were accepted as evidences of a fussy 
principal. Having been a good student, she was begin- 
ning to feel very sensitive and much unappreciated. So 
I decided upon a surprise attack. She needed help, but 
needed to forget she was being supervised. 
Solution. I dropped into the class, started a discussion, 
and in the midst of it asked the pupils if they realized 
that the New Europe they were studying was splendid 
material for a play. It took that lesson and the next 
to lay plans. The idea of a play once adopted, a big 
map of cut-out countries was planned, songs and dances 
from music room and gymnasium were called for, a 
search for victrola selections was started, interest ran 
high. The new atmosphere caught the teacher. The play 
was planned to be given for the parents at the end of 
the term. It was a big undertaking. They realized they 
had to work hard to get the geographical background. 
Result. I think the project has been very much worth 
while for both the pupils and the teacher. She and the 
class are now working together. The teacher accepts sug- 
gestions as aids to better teaching. Her work is satis- 
factory.

fhe Teacher Failed to Discover Reading Deficiencies 
of Slower Pupils 
Case. Miss A. was a first-grade teacher in a county 
system. She had special ability in the teaching of music 
and oral reading. She e- gave a largé part of her time to 
the oe bright “pupils, “a and could- ‘show off’’ her 
tage. She was rated as one~-of th ict “best. teachers in the 
village school, yet she could not_get results from the aver- 
age and below-average pupils. This was not discovered, 
however, until the end~of-the first year. 
Solution. At the beginning of the second year the 
supervisor applied objective measurement. The oral 
reading of each first-grade pupil was measured by means 
of the Gray oral-reading tests. In the February test 
eleven out of a class of twenty-five pupils made no score 
whatever. 
‘The pupils were then checked by using sight-reading 
lessons in the primer. When the pupils could see. the 
pictures, they read entire pages. When the pictures were 
covered from view they read, but not what was on the page. 
This teacher did not have to be told that she had empha- 
sized expression and memory reading. She asked the super- 
visor to come again in four weeks and see what she could do. 
Results. After two visits the number of pupils who 
could not read was reduced to five. The test laid the 
basis for proper teaching.   8. Discipline and Poor Teaching

-P-A-G-E-323
FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 305 
Solution. In a conference with the teacher the super- 
visor suggested that they take the lesson as taught, 
analyze it in terms of the principles of teaching involved, 
and as each difficulty arose suggest a measure of improve- 
ment. 
With the idea that interest would lead to self-activity, 
a series of drill problems were provided for the more 
advanced pupils, each to proceed at his own rate. A 
blackboard graph to show the number of problems com- 
pleted by each child was used to stimulate interest and 
effort. 
For those children who failed in long division alto- 
gether, special exercises were planned. Those whose 
failure was due to a lack of knowledge of multiples were 
provided with multiple cards and tested singly. The 
eards on which each child failed were left with him for 
study, and he was allowed to return to the drill prob- 
lems in long division as soon as he had mastered multiples. 
This method provided for the individual growth of the 
children. 
Those children making mistakes in subtraction, which 
was a case of lack of skill in connecting old knowledge 
with a new experience, were cared for similarly. 
Through a series of conferences the power to analyze 
difficulties and provide for individual differences was 
mastered by the teacher. 
Results. The teacher’s problem in discipline disap- 
peared. 
9. The Teacher Who Failed to Adapt Teaching to the 
Needs of Slower Pupils 
Case. The organization of classes on the basis of mental 
tests has brought various problems. One of these“is the 
failure of not-a—few-teachers to adjust themselves either 
wholly or in part to the different groups of children.
-P-A-G-E-324
  | 
306 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
This teacher had under her direction a group of B-2 
children—very dull or border-line cases. She knew that 
the class was of very inferior mentality, but the idea that 
- she must put into operation a new type of machinery 
did not occur to her. 
Solution. After several weeks of vain effort to adjust 
herself, the teacher appealed to the principal for help. 
The principal spent one entire day with her, and listed 
the things that appeared to him to be in need of change. 
He then suggested that she study her children individu- 
ally, and classify them into groups on a basis of both 
mental ability and social habits. After the teacher had 
done this the principal asked her to forget the fact that 
the children were in the second grade, and try to think of 
them as being five or five and one-half years of age men- 
tally. Together the teacher and the principal planned mate- 
rials that were suitable to the children’s mental level, group 
by group. Before long all of the children were working 
happily upon something within the range of their 
ability. 
Results. The teacher’s attitude toward the class soon 
changed completely, and the work proceeded along normal 
lines without the friction and spirit of unrest that pre- 
vailed earlier in the term. 
10. The Teacher Who Failed Fifty Per Cent of the Class 
Case. The sixth-grade teacher sent a class of fifteen 
mid-year promotions into the departmental work of the 
seventh grade. After two weeks the two teachers in 
charge of this work made the startling announcement 
that seven of these pupils were unfitted for the work 
and must return to the sixth grade. The teacher of the 
latter class immediately appealed to the superintendent. 
Solution. The superintendent took the pupils’ names, 
heard both sides of the story, observed the class work, went
-P-A-G-E-325
FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 307 
to his records, and then gave tests to the seventh-grade 
classes. 
Results. The data revealed that one pupil in the group 
had been a special problem, but that the remainder of 
the pupils were well able to handle the seventh-grade 
work. 
11. The Teacher Who Was Assigned Too Much Work 
Case. A certain teacher persisted in assigning too much 
work in Latin. The class exercises were for the purpose 
of testing how well the pupils had studied the assign- 
ment. The result was that about one-half of the class 
failed. 
Solution. During four forty-minute visits the superin- 
tendent observed practically no explanations of difficult 
grammatical constructions. He had a conference with the 
teacher, and pointed out in a kindly way the difficulty 
as he saw it. The teacher insisted that the children were 
‘‘dull.’? Whereupon the superintendent proceeded to 
give some mental tests. The class was above the average. 
The teacher doubted the validity of the test results, 
but she did not offer any argument to support her 
position. 
The superintendent then informed the teacher very 
frankly that he would in two months give some achieve- 
ment tests to obtain the results of her work. Nothing 
more was said. 
The tests were given as the superintendent directed, 
and the class made a good showing. (On previous 
tests practically none of the pupils were able to 
answer.) 
Results. Scientific, objective proof which the teacher 
could not rebut showed that she was wrong. The super- 
intendent made her right. This is not a good policy 
every time, but it worked here.
-P-A-G-E-326
308 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
12. A Change in Method Needed 
Case. A majority of the teachers in this school system 
used a method of teaching phonics that involved all pos- 
sible phonetic sounds and combinations. After a demon- 
stration was given illustrating a. different method of 
phonic instruction, many teachers were still loathe to 
give up their present procedure. 
Solution. The supervisor worked with a group of 
younger teachers who were willing to try a usable system 
of phonics based on a minimum list of phonetic com- 
binations derived from the tabulation of ten primers, 
ten first readers, ten second readers, and ten third 
readers. This minimum list reduced itself to fifteen com- 
mon phonograms and three simple rules. 
The supervisor then initiated an experiment in twenty 
buildings. For six weeks one group of teachers taught 
phonies by the simpler method and another group con- 
tinued to teach in their own formal way. At the end 
of the period a stiff pronunciation test was given to 
pupils of both groups. 
Results showed that children taught all possible pho- 
netic sounds and combinations had to rely on memory 
alone to aid them in pronunciation tests, whereas other 
pupils applied their knowledge of the fifteen families or 
the three simple rules. Children of the first group found 
it a mental impossibility to recall all phonetic combina- 
tions of the common English words. The results showed 
a decided gain for the second group over the first. 
Results. The teachers were convinced, and wanted to 
use the more economical method. 
13. A Conservative Becomes a Progressive 
Case. In a system of about 500 elementary pupils, one 
of the teachers had taught a certain fourth grade for a 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 309 
greet many years. The superintendent was new, but 
found in an early visit that although the teacher’s dis- 
cipline was good, her methods were out of date. The 
teacher felt certain that long experience justified the con- 
tinuance of these methods, and it was evident that she 
intended to keep by them. 
Solution. Not wishing to have trouble with such an 
old ‘‘resident,’’ the superintendent sat down to study out 
the situation. He finally decided upon a self-survey of 
the system, using a number of standardized tests, espe- 
cially in reading, spelling, and arithmetic. 
The results indicated that this grade was well below 
in most of the things. tested. When the results were 
posted on the bulletin board, considerable discussion fol- 
lowed. The teacher in question apparently had a battle 
with herself, but after a few days she appeared at the 
office, rather quiet and meek, and asked for aid in rais- 
ing her class standings. Of course, this was the opening 
wedge, and by using care and tact the superintendent 
introduced her to newer methods and ideas. S 
Results. From a conservative of the old type, she soon 
became progressive and gained a new interest in school 
matters. 
14, Peaceful Penetration 
Case. In a large city school, the head of the depart- 
ment may be a person of long years of teaching experi- 
ence, but an ardent devotee of the traditional. Such was 
this case. The problem was one dealing with a highly 
cultured, highly intelligent, and very positive-thinking 
head of the English department. The case was solved by 
kindly, tactful, and sympathetic contacts. 
Solution. The principal began by holding frequent 
informal chats with the person in question. The principal 
spoke incidentally but frequently of some of the latter-
-P-A-G-E-328
  310 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
day ideas and practices in the teaching of English, the 
most of which were characterized by the head of the 
department as ‘‘bunk.’’ Finally, one day, the principal 
suggested that as a mere matter of curiosity the English 
department ought to try out certain suggestions relative 
to home reading and methods of administering the same, 
as given in the 1917 Bulletin of the Bureau of Educa- 
tion on the ‘‘Reorganization of English.’’? In talking to 
the department head, the principal gave the impression 
that he doubted the efficiency of the department’s meth- 
ods. By frequent tactful talks during the year the prin- 
cipal gradually influenced the method of teaching of the 
department head in question. 
Results. At the close of the year the department head 
was enthusiastic about new methods and materials. 
15. A Social-Science Lesson 
The teacher of social science presented more than an 
ordinary challenge. Each member of this sixth-grade 
glass, which was supposedly making a study of France, 
was supplied with a copy of Essentials of Geography, 
Book II. These books lay open on the desks while bored 
owners were entertaining themselves in various ways in- 
stead of following the oral reading of one of their num- 
ber. The teacher assisted with pronunciation of unfamiliar 
words and occasionally referred to a wall map. 
At the close of school that day a request for a con- 
ference, which the principal so dreaded, came from the 
teacher. There seemed so little in the lesson to commend. 
The first question put to the teacher was how she rated 
her lesson. To the principal’s surprise and relief her rat- 
ing was identical with the principal’s. Here was some- 
thing to commend. The teacher’s realization of the situa- 
tion made it possible to make changes in organization 
and method more easily and quickly. When asked the 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
  
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 311 
reason for the present condition, she ascribed it to in- 
attention of pupils. Causes of inattention were then dis- 
cussed. The teacher was led to see that it was frequently 
due to inefficient presentation of the subject matter, but 
in defense said she had undertaken the teaching of social 
science in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades because no 
one else had been willing to do so. 
The principal then offered to assist her in reorganizing 
and building up a technique that would make her work 
more satisfactory to herself and helpful to the children. 
It was suggested that the teacher and the class make an 
outline of topics or a list of problems to be studied. Then 
the class was broken up into groups with a chairman for 
each group who worked on a special topic that was of 
interest to him. The members of each group would be 
given an opportunity to tell about their findings later. 
This method provided a motive for work, an opportunity 
for service, leadership, and codperation, besides making 
it possible to cover a wider field. 
Then came the question of how to secure material. 
Books of which the teacher had known nothing were 
found in bookeases and closets. The teacher visited the 
public library and also requested the children to bring 
books from home. After several days had passed, another 
visit was made by the principal. At this time chairmen 
were taking charge of groups and the teacher was in the 
background. There were many references in the pupils’ 
reports to books read. There was substantial evidence 
that the books were being used. 
Later, material from the Children’s Museum and the 
Department of Visual Education was used. 
Finally, many of the children, on their own initiative, 
went to the library and returned with books from which 
they wished to report to the class. Pictures brought by 
pupils were mounted and used as occasion arose. 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  312 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
By the end of the year the geography classes presented. 
an interested group of children, developing in leadership, 
codperation, self-direction, and self-appraisal, with a 
teacher who, though failing at first, was now doing work 
of at least average quality. 
16. The Supervisor Taught 
Case. The teacher used worn-out methods of teaching 
reading. Hach child had the same book. The reading was 
largely oral, and the pupils read one by one with fre- 
quent rereading of paragraphs. The children not only 
failed to get the story but were restless and inattentive. 
Solution. The supervisor took the class, turned to a 
new story, and after giving the brief setting needed, 
asked the children to read portions silently to see who 
could find the answers to certain thought-provoking ques- 
tions which the supervisor gave them. The reading be- 
came a sort of game, the children became alert, and a 
new atmosphere seemed to pass over the class. The super- 
visor called the children’s attention to the fact that they | 
could read more rapidly without lip movement. She also 
showed them that they could get the story just as well by 
reading rapidly. 
After class she talked the work over with the teacher, 
explaining to her the different types of reading material 
and the several methods of procedure. The supervisor 
suggested that each lesson be carefully planned; also that 
the method of teaching fit the type of lesson taught. She 
then recommended several books on methods of teaching 
reading. Among these was Stone’s Oral and Silent 
Reading, which contains type lessons and _ readable 
discussions of reading lessons. Many conferences fol- 
lowed. 
Results. The teacher became greatly interested in the 
great variety of efficient methods of teaching reading,
-P-A-G-E-331
  
FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 313 
and became eventually an exceptional teacher in that

17. The Principal Introduces More Socialization 
Case. A class of subnormal boys were studying local 
geography. The topic of the day’s lesson was ‘‘ Public 
Buildings and How to Reach Them.’’ On the board were 
listed the names of the important buildings of the city. 
In the hands of the pupils were city maps of the folding 
variety. The type of recitation was much as follows: 
Teacher. Ben, how would you go to the City Hall? 
Pupil. I would take a Jefferson car west, transfer north on 
Woodward, and get off at Fort Street. 
The teaching, day in and day out, was obviously of 
the question and answer type. 
Solution. The principal suggested the socialized recita- 
‘tion. The teacher was willing to use this method, but 
thought it impossible with this type of pupil. However, 
the class was divided into groups and set to work upon 
specific problems. Each group selected one building 
for intensive study. They gathered available materials 
‘such as post cards, pictures, clippings from current 
‘papers, and books in the school library, some of which 
were the results of school projects developed in other 
classes, 
The pupils as a result not only learned to recognize 
buildings, but were informed concerning the offices and 
the kind of business conducted in buildings to be 
visited. 
Resulis. The results were very marked. There were 
greater pupil participation, keener interest, and increased 
knowledge not only of the location of each building but 
of its use. Each boy evidenced a responsibility in develop- 
ing and presenting his contribution to the work.

New Method _ / ra oe

any years. Her method of teaching was mold 
ciplinary with very negligible results. The supervisor 
visited her and tried to ‘‘put across’’ the idea of group 
spelling, pupils grouped according to ability, pupils as 
leaders, progress from group to group, ete. The teache 
could not grasp such a radical departure, and the supe 
r, perceiving 1] this, went to the principal, carefully 
reviewé plan, Fr eid nal ede terete eerie: et 
Solution. The principal waited for the teacher to come 
to the office, which she did at the first opportunity. She 
told the principal what the supervisor had suggested, but 
confessed that she did not know how to go about it, and 
feared that her attempt would result in a great deal of 
confusion. 
The principal proposed that they work out the first 
lessons together, and then carefully reviewed the steps of 
procedure. The teacher and the principal arranged to 
give a preliminary test before making the groupings. The 
next day the principal visited the class, explained the 
plan, and carefully impressed upon the children, largely 
for the benefit of the teacher, each step of the study pro- 
cedure. The following day the principal again visited the 
class and acted as leader for the poorest group while the 
teacher took the middle group and a bright pupil took 
the best group. By this time both teacher and pupils 
were enthusiastic. 
Results. The plan was carried on very successfully 
throughout the term. 
           
   
      19. The Question-and-Answer Method 
Case. A 6A class in geography. A teacher of aver- 
age ability, conscientious, and with the right attitude 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 315 
toward suggestions. She had professional training, but 
had no conception either of group work or of individual 
differences in children. The question-and-answer method 
prevailed, and the usual range of material consisted of 
the regular text and one or two supplemental texts. 
Solution. The first step was to discuss with the teacher 
the opportunities for productive work and real growth 
when pupils were given the chance to advance at their 
own level of achievement. The teacher was able offhand 
(from her knowledge of their work) to group the chil- 
dren into bright, average, and slow sections. There was 
a discussion of the best method of interesting the chil- 
dren in the idea of group work and getting from them 
their suggestions concerning the method of procedure, 
leaders, material, etc. Here the teacher must wisely guide 
and suggest, prevent aimless talking, etc., without impos- 
ing her own judgment. 
Daily conferences between the principal and the teacher 
were necessary to talk over each new step—how best to 
proceed, how to anticipate difficulties. There was also a 
discussion after each lesson. As the work proceeded, many 
problems arose. A few of these are listed: 
. Launching the group idea; choice of leaders 
. Guiding timid and officious leaders 
. Sources of material and how to make the best use of it 
Conferences with leaders about their plans, delegating work, 
checking on contributions of members of group in both study 
and recitation periods, ete. 
. Evaluating material (within comprehension) 
. Supervision of slower groups 
. Work expected from groups 
. Use of outlines, indices, dictionary 
. Developing sense of responsibility in leaders and coworkers. Bw 
OCONAMN 
Results. Although results were far from brilliant, there 
was a marked growth in the teacher’s work and in the
-P-A-G-E-334
316 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
development of desirable qualities in many of the chil- 
dren. There was a real test of the work. The principal 
asked the teacher to give a demonstration lesson in which 
each type of work was given. Attention was focused upon 
pupil participation, attention, concentration, sense of 
responsibility, ete. The group of principals who observed 
this lesson rated the teacher as on the whole most satis- 
factory. 
20. The Teacher Who Opposed the Testing Program 
Case. The principal attempted to launch a testing pro- 
gram but discovered a teacher, fifteen years in the service, 
in opposition. The teacher was quite influential in the 
community and without her support the program might 
have failed. 
The class had been divided into three sections, and this 
teacher was in charge of one of them. 
Solution. Monroe’s ‘‘Silent Reading Test’’ was given. 
to two of the sections, and after a diagnosis of the con- 
ditions remedial teaching was begun. Practice tests were 
given from time to time, and by the mid-term examina- 
tions it was found that these two sections were well in 
advance of the third section. 
Results. The teacher was convinced, much against her 
will, that tests were of diagnostic value. She now realized 
the advantages of tests and became a strong advocate of 
this type of work. Although the testing program was 
delayed for the greater part of one year, the cause 
was won. 
21. The Teacher Who Used University Methods 
Case. A young man, a university graduate, was assigne 
to teach social science in an upper grade. His academic¢| 
background was more than adequate. His knowledge o 
children and of method was, however, very meager. Hi 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 317 
idea of teaching was to teach subject matter; and his 
idea of method was to use question and answer. He used 
also a modified form of the lecture method. 
Solution. The supervisor’s problem was to arouse the 
teacher’s interest in modern methods, and give him a 
vision of pupil activity, of purposeful teaching, and of 
socialized activities. The supervisor 
1. Invited the teacher to attend regular group meetings on the 
teaching of social science. 
2. Held a number of conferences on specific teaching problems. 
3. Planned with the teacher a long list of purposeful activities 
through conferences before and after teaching. 
4, Had the teacher observe skillful teaching showing clearly these 
points. This was preceded and followed by discussions. 
5. Planned readings correlating with the points emphasized. 
Results. The teacher showed a change of attitude 
toward method, subject matter, and their relation to each 
other in the teaching process; a greater faith in the ability 
of pupils to purpose, plan, execute, and judge; and a 
desire for further understanding and use of twentieth- 
century methods of teaching. 
22. The Teacher Is Stimulated to Organize Work on 
Unit Basis 
Case. The teacher had received little training in the 
technique of teaching, although he was master of the sub- 
ject matter; namely, cabinet-making. Too much serap— 
pieces of work that were ruined in the process of fabrica- 
tion—was in evidence. The problem persisted. 
Solution. The supervisor visited the room and found 
the waste extensive. At the end of a conference, how- 
ever, the supervisor asked the teacher if he had any 
special difficulties. The teacher immediately told of the 
difficulty with waste materials. The supervisor then said, 
“IT will tell you how to handle this problem if you will  
-P-A-G-E-336
318 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
first tell me how you keep record.’? The method used 
was for the teacher to go around the shop while the boys 
were at work and inspect the progress made. 
After thinking a minute, the supervisor offered some 
suggestions for the organization of work: ‘‘Give each 
pupil a definite amount of work to do, perhaps a single 
operation. When this is done have it brought to you for 
approval and for further instructions.’’ 
This stimulated the teacher to think about better organ- 
ization, and later led him to organize the work on the 
unit basis. Each job was divided into progress units. For 
each unit completed, one credit was entered on the record 
book opposite the pupil’s name. The grade earned de- 
pended upon the number of units done, within commer- 
cial tolerance. Although the principal’s original idea 
was considerably modified, the plan was an almost perfect 
check on the pupils’ work and reduced ‘‘scrap’’ to a 
minimum. 
Results. The idea of having definitely indicated points 
of progress known to both teacher and pupil became this 
teacher’s fundamental philosophy of teaching. 
23, Assisting the Teacher to Diagnose Individual Diffi- 
culties : 
Case. The case is that of a 6A teacher whose teaching 
of arithmetic was very poor. She floundered about, not 
seeming to know just what her difficulty was nor how to 
remedy it. 
Solution. The first thing done was to test the class, 
using an intelligence test, td ascertain whether the pupils 
were properly placed. Then an arithmetic test was given 
to obtain more information about the pupils’ understand- 
ing of the fundamental operations. This showed that about 
25 per cent of the group were weak on zero combinations 
and fractions. Each case was diagnosed and the difficulty
-P-A-G-E-337
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 319 
explained to the children. The teacher and principal 
worked together. Much drill suited to the needs of the 
class was given. A daily graph of the program of the 
class was kept on the board. Individual graphs were kept 
by the children. Interest soon waxed high. 
Results. Of the class, 80 per cent exceeded the score 
for their grade in the final test, 18 per cent were average 
for their grade, and only 2 per cent failed to attain it. 
Their interest never waned, and now, after the pupils 
have reached the Junior High School, they are still keep- 
ing individual graphs, although not required to do so. 
24. The Teacher Who Repeated Questions 
Case. An arithmetic class receiving dictation problems 
from an inexperienced teacher furnishes the setting. 
There was constant repetition of problems by the teacher 
and waving of hands on the part of the children who 
failed to copy problems correctly even after a second and 
third dictation. 
Solution. The report was given by the teacher. The 
supervisor listened for several minutes, and then quietly 
asked, ‘‘Could they get the problems with one reading ?’’ 
The teacher did not know the answer to this question at 
the time, but it took very few lessons for her to discover: 
1. That she had been wasting class time. 
2. That she had been training children in inattention. 
3. That she had been doing unnecessary talking. 
Results. In the first place, the question called for an 
answer. The teacher was too inexperienced to be sure of 
the answer at the time, but the question resulted in con- 
siderable reflection in after days. To this day she can 
never repeat words during spelling dictation, or give a 
direction a second time, that from somewhere in her sub- 
conscious mind does not come the question, ‘‘Could they 
get it without repetition?’’
-P-A-G-E-338

25, The Teacher Who Repeated Pupils’ Answers 
Case. The principal found Miss A, one of his teachers, 
repeating every answer given by the pupils. She would 
say, ‘‘yes,’’? and then reword the answer. 
Solution. The principal visited the class, counted the 
times that the teacher repeated the answers, and then 
called for a conference. The teacher was surprised but 
maintained that repeating answers was ‘‘no harm.’’ 
She admitted, however, that questions should be 
thought-provoking, and promised to refrain from say- 
ing ‘‘yes’’ and ‘‘no’’ and from repeating the pupils’ 
answers. 
Results. The result was a revelation to the teacher. 
Pupils failing to receive the usual ‘‘yes’’ to a partly cor- 
rect answer looked in doubt, and immediately tried to 
reword their answer. Although the pupils were at first 
somewhat lost because of the lack of assistance from 
the teacher, the new plan added interest and the work 
improved. : 
26. The Teacher Who Talked Too Much 
Case. A certain principal found his teachers talking 
ay pee Sey eae slag See te | 
é€ ith this fact. The principal was desirous of more 
pupil activity: 
Solution. The principal borrowed a stop watch from 
the athletic director, and visited the classes of his talking 
teachers with the stop watch in hand. On leaving the 
room the principal noted by his own watch how long he 
had been in the room and by the stop watch how many 
minutes the teacher had talked. The two gave him the 
percentage of talk. Some teachers ran as high as 60 
per cent. 
Results. The teachers were convinced, and listened 
readily to corrective suggestions.

27. The Class That Used a Family Comb 
Case. (The story is told by an elementary-school prin. 
cipal.) The room, a first grade, was the cleanest I have . 
ever seen, and every pupil in the room was so immacu- 
late that the effect was almost startling to visitors, espe- 
cially if they had first visited other rooms of the building. 
The teacher’s influence on the children was so great that 
the parents of the children would not dare send their 
little ones to school in clothes not strictly fresh. 
It happened one day that I was in the cloakroom when 
the boys passed through from recess. At the far end of 
this room, just at the door to the classroom, was a small 
table on which was a mirror. I noticed that all of the 
boys stopped at this table, and upon investigating I found 
that there was a comb there. Each boy took the comb 
and ‘‘slicked’’ down his hair! Something needed to be 
done. 
Solution. I did not dare say anything directly to the 
teacher. She would have spent her night in bitter tears. 
That was her temperament. So after thinking over the 
matter I decided to call a conference of the first-grade 
teachers in the building to talk about changes in the 
health curriculum. At this conference we drew up cer- 
tain habit goals which we wished to establish for the 
children. A suggestion of mine, coming right after the 
‘individual toothbrush’’ suggestion of one of the teachers, 
was, ‘‘An individual comb. A family comb is almost as 
bad as a common toothbrush.’’ 
Results. Two days later I visited the teacher men- 
tioned. The comb had disappeared, and the boys were 
“‘slicking’’ down their hair with their fingers. 
28. Disciplining a Gymnasium Class 
Case. A gymnasium teacher had trouble with disci- 
pline. She was bright and well trained, but young, in-
-P-A-G-E-340
322 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
experienced, and lacked self-confidence. The situa- 
tion demanded prompt, vigorous, but careful super- 
vision. 
Solution. I (the principal is reporting) proceeded as 
follows: I asked the teacher to come to my office for a 
conference about materials for the course. 
In this conference I tried to show: 
1. In detail what was to be done. 
2. The necessity of athletic skill and training on the part of the 
teacher to win the respect of the boys. 
. The desirability of keeping something doing constantly. 
. The undesirability of constantly using shrill blasts of the 
whistle to get attention. 
5. The need of securing attention before giving commands or 
directions. 
. How to select the social leaders of the group. 
. How to motivate the work through a field day the following 
spring in which the pupils were to compete. IB o9 NO 
Results. As a result the teacher worked out a scoring 
system or card, the items of which were to count in 
selecting participants for field-day events. This did much 
to clear up the difficulty. The teacher’s technique, poise, 
and confidence were greatly improved, and the work went 
forward successfully. 
29, The Teacher Who Needed a Complete Overhauling 
Case. Miss A was a departmental teacher of arithmetic 
in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades of a medium-sized 
grade school. i ina city of 12,000. She was a normal-school 
<perience vigorous, ener- 
    
  Sohution, The Loltvat: had nee been in site system long 
until the principal discovered through personal observa- 
tions and through complaints that she was giving too 
much and too difficult work. The teacher was perfectly
-P-A-G-E-341
FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 323 
willing to learn, but somewhat difficult to teach. The 
principal showed her objectively that 70 per cent of her 
children were not getting the work. The principal then 
took an assignment made by the teacher and put the chil- 
dren to work on it, with the result that it took them twice 
as long to complete it as they had time for the work. 
The teacher had difficulty in making her assignments 
simple enough for the pupils to understand. She over- 
eame this by actually checking with the class. By means 
of supervised study she learned something of the actual 
amount of work that pupils could do in a given amount 
of time. 
After the teacher had learned how to make an assign- 
ment—how long and how definite—she was ready for 
some of the finer points of teaching. The principal and 
teacher then took up systematically the following prob- 
lems: class attention, time the teacher talks, time elapsing 
between asking the question and designating the pupil 
to respond, special drill technique, use of blackboard in 
assignments, special drill periods for weak pupils, num- 
ber of pupils offering to respond to questions, ete. There 
were many conferences, each on a specific item of teach- 
ing. The teacher also read magazine puiclee and books 
on her subject. 
Results. At first the progress was slow; afterwards, 
very fast. At first the principal did a good deal of the 
work. Later he merely suggested. The results were en- 
tirely satisfactory. 
30. The Teacher Who Objected to Supervision 
Case. I (the principal) attempted to help a teacher of 
Social Science. Her attitude toward supervision was 
antagonistic, and she informed me that she would not 
teach under observation. I tried very hard to change 
her ideas of a supervisor, and to show her that a prin-
-P-A-G-E-342
  324 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
cipal is truly anxious to help the children through the 
teacher. 
Solution. She had some very good ideas about teach- 
ing civies through an organization in her classes whereby 
committees representing all the departments of city gov- 
ernment functioned in the school. Most of her ideas I 
gained by talking with her in the hall, the office, or 
standing at her door. I encouraged her in every way to 
work out her plans, helped her to obtain materials, 
arranged visits for the classes to city departments, went 
with her and her pupils to court, ete., in all of which I 
found it quite necessary to visit her room frequently. 
In time I gained her confidence, and she invited me 
to sessions of her court, which were truly impressive. I 
know that she was liberated from the old notion of super- 
vision. I quite agree that to liberate teachers supervisors 
must be courteous directors, skillful suggestors, inspira- 
tional leaders, subtle pathfinders. This is certainly an 
ideal for principals to work toward. 
Results. At any rate this teacher has done some espe- 
cially good work, and has contributed some really con- 
structive ideas to the Social Science department. The 
outcome for her was promotion to a more responsible 
position. 
31. A Teacher Tells How He Was Improved through 
Supervision 
Case. I had just graduated from the Indiana State 
Normal School and felt that I knew all there was to be 
known about the art of teaching. My first job was in a 
little school in Oregon. The first difficulty to overcome 
was the semi-ill feeling of the people toward conceited 
“‘Hasterners.’’ By my acts unintentionally I came in for 
my share. Second, I had done all my teaching in a 
medium-sized school, and my teacher training, too, so
-P-A-G-E-343
FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 
I was not able at first to adjust myself to a school of 
fifty pupils. Third, having been brought up by myself 
I did not understand children as I should. 
Solution. After a short while the superintendent called 
me into his office, and after a pleasant chat said: ‘‘I 
have never seen a first-year fellow able to do as well as 
you have, but you still have something to learn. There 
is no question about your knowing your subject matter. 
You could, however, improve along other lines.’’? Then 
he proceeded to tell me of the feeling of the people 
toward those from the East, what he considered a proper 
attitude to take, and gave me helpful points on how to 
adjust myself. He also caused me to realize that school 
boys and girls are not mature people. 
Result. All was said in such a fatherly and friendly 
way that I went away smiling, something hard for me 
to do, and as a result I did better work and gained the 
good will of all. Mr. will always have a place in 
my memory as the man who started me out right. 
32. The Helpful Principal 
Case. In a certain small elementary school a begin- 
ning teacher failed to make the students understand 
arithmetic. 
Solution. The principal observed her carefully for 
about two weeks, at the end of which time he very tact- 
fully drew her into a conversation about her work. It 
was so well done that the teacher herself outlined her 
difficulties. She knew her failing, but did not know how 
to remedy it. She asked him for help. The principal in 
no way criticized her, but through his pleasant way she 
saw that she could trust him to help her. She was frank 
and honest with herself and with him, and asked for all 
the help he could give her. The principal assisted as 
follows:

anged for her to visit another teacher in the building. 
vw. axv vue teacher’s suggestion the principal taught her class 
several times. 
4, The principal arranged individual conferences with pupils who 
needed help. 
5. Each pupil was studied, given work he could understand, and 
led on step by step. 
Results. Proper teaching habits were established. 
33. Mastering the Fundamentals 
Case. In a certain elementary school there was a second- 
grade teacher who was a literary genius and a writer of 
fairy tales and children’s stories. The children were held 
spellbound by her tales. Even the parents worshiped 
her and awaited eagerly the time when their children 
would reach her room. But the third-grade teachers 
dreaded the promotion of these very pupils. For several 
years the teachers to whose lot these children fell had 
to do double work the succeeding semester. The pupils 
were not prepared in the minimum essentials. 
Solution. A new principal was appointed. After sev- 
eral visits to Miss A’s room, he was greatly worried 
about her careless methods of teaching the three R’s. 
How to approach her with helpful criticism was a prob- 
lem. Finally he hit upon a plan. He asked each teacher 
to send him a list of the spelling words that her pupils 
had learned the previous month. Of these he selected 
twenty-five words for each grade and gave a test. Tests 
were marked and room percentages posted. Miss A’s 
pupils ranked lowest. She was astonished and dismayed! 
For several days she stayed in her room silent and down- 
hearted. Then one day she appeared before the principal, 
entreating him to show her how to teach spelling. 
After a long talk the principal took from his library 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES _ 327 
several books on methods of teaching and handed them to 
Miss A. 
Results. The standard of her room was raised decidedly, 
and her classes, once dreaded by the third-grade teachers, 
are now anticipated with great joy. In fact, the com- 
bination of talent, charming personality, and good teach- 
ing has given her a standing above her coworkers. 
34, Training a Tradesman 
Case. A tradesman became an instructor in a part- 
time school of 100 teachers. He was a thorough mechanic, 
but did not appreciate that teaching mechanics required 
an additional technique. He belittled scientific methods 
of instruction, did not see the value of a well-thought-out 
course of study, and saw nothing in professional training. 
His honest conviction was that his trade knowledge was 
sufficient. His classes were not well conducted. Disci- 
pline was poor and the instruction was inefficient, scat- 
tering, and unorganized. It was evident that he had 
many good qualities, but was never helpful in his attitude 
toward professional training of teachers. 
Solution. The policy adopted at first by the supervisors 
was one of gentle persuasion and suggestions in regard 
to the handling of certain matters, followed by the syste- 
matic pointing out of plans for improvement. 
After a period of trial it was manifest that this treat- 
ment was not effective. A new plan was devised. A group 
meeting of several trade teachers was planned, in which 
each one was to make a contribution concerning methods 
of teaching. The supervisor assigned subjects upon which 
they could prepare papers. He gave the teacher in ques- 
tion a subject dealing with the professional improvement 
of teachers. As the conference approached, the teacher 
began to perceive his lack of information. He began to 
make inquiries, but obtained such piecemeal information
-P-A-G-E-346
  328 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
from several sources that he could not formulate a com- 
prehensive plan. 
Results. In despair he turned to the supervisor for 
help. A series of discussions followed in which the super- 
visor gave him a brief course of teacher training. A 
very presentable paper grew out of it. When the round 
table took place, the teacher showed great interest in 
the discussions, was commended for his contribution, 
and then humbly admitted that his eyes had been 
opened. 
35. A Good Teacher Was Made Better 
Facts. An elementary evening-school teacher, rated A 
by both the day- and night-school principal, and whose 
classroom would stand the test of interest, concentration, 
and participation, was found giving incorrectly three of 
the basic phonetic elements of the English language. 
She was an experienced teacher, and had indulged in this 
error for a number of years without any apparent adverse 
results. 
Problem. To bring to the teacher’s consciousness a 
recognition of this activity as an error in such a manner 
that a desire to correct it would be developed at the 
same time. 
Solution. Individual conference. The supervisor dis- 
cussed various activities of the class work, commending 
specific excellences such as choice of material, snappy 
recall, ete., and leading quickly to a general discussion 
of the tendency toward inaccuracy in the pronuncia- 
tion of phonic elements. The supervisor first men- 
tioned some errors made by teachers she had observed, 
and then the specific ones made by the teacher of this 
ease. (This was a conference between the supervisor and 
teacher, not a monologue by the supervisor.) At this 
stage the teacher was in a receptive mood, and a lively 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  FAILURES AND SUCCESSES 329 
discussion with pertinent questions on her part was evi- 
dence of a real desire to correct her errors. 
Results. At a succeeding visit of the supervisor the 
teacher with pride was using the elements correctly. 
Heretofore her attitude toward phonic analysis had been 
that of one who had mastered those simple devices and 
was bored by the discussion. Now she was enrolled in 
a course with the idea of perfecting herself along this 
line, and she became an authority among her fellow 
teachers on correct enunciation. A warm fellowship has 
developed between the teacher and supervisor. A good 
teacher was made a better one through supervision. 
Summary. The preceding cases, typical as they are 
of the problems met by supervisors wherever they may 
be, are illustrative of the complexity of the work of 
supervision, of its highly specialized demands upon the 
supervisor, and of the rich returns. in teaching service 
when successful methods are used. 
Too much, therefore, cannot be said in urging super- 
visors to study each teacher in her particular teaching 
job. Each presents a special opportunity for expert ser- 
vice both to the individual and to the school system. 
Much can be done to raise teaching levels through teach- 
ers’ meetings, reading of professional books, and the like, 
and all of these are necessary and effective in promoting 
unity of purpose in the school system. But none of these 
will ever take the place of classroom visitation, together 
with thorough and verified diagnosis made to function 
by effective conference with the teacher upon her specific 
needs and abilities. 
That sympathetic leadership extended in conference 
which makes the teacher respect and desire to consult 
the supervisor is alone worthwhile. In addition, the 
reciprocal benefit to the supervisor of a personal acquaint- 
ance with the teacher, together with the resultant im-
-P-A-G-E-348

  CHAPTER XI 
REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR TYPES OF FAILURES OTHER THAN 
TEACHING TECHNIQUE 
Remedial measures in supervision. The discussion up 
to this point has centered around cases of inferior teach- 
ing technique. The lack of control over the technique 
of teaching, however, is only one among many causes of 
poor teaching. Many other factors, such as the lack of 
effort, lack of knowledge of subject matter, lack of initia- 
tive, lack of physical ability, ete., contribute to the failure 
of teachers. It is the purpose of this chapter to study 
some of these less frequently mentioned causes of poor 
teaching, and suggest remedial measures for them. 
Why teachers fail. A questionnaire study based upon 
281 replies reported by Sherman Lettler gave a list of 
causes of failure among elementary-school teachers, as 
shown in the table on page 332:1 
The diagnosis is important. In an earlier chapter 
much was said about diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is 
fundamental to remedial measures. Assistance is effective 
only when the type of failure is clearly discerned. As 
a matter of fact, the remedy is often easily discovered 
when the exact cause of the difficulty is located. Sup- 
plementing the data presented in the table, ‘‘Causes of 
failure among elementary-school teachers,’’? a number of

teaching records were consulted to discover additional 
information about why teachers fail. These causes were 
grouped under the following headings which we shall 
eall types. The list is given with a consideration of its 
diagnostic value:

Type 11 REMEDIAL MEASURES 333 
Lack of control over the technique of teaching. The 
teacher may be totally ignorant of the science of 
teaching or unable to apply its principles. She does 
not know how to teach. 
Lack of ability to maintain order and discipline. The 
teacher fails to command attention. The room is in 
confusion. 
Lack of mastery of subject matter. The teacher does 
not know her subject. This difficulty appears more 
frequently on the high-school level. 
Lack of intelligence. The teacher lacks native ability 
to cope with the situation. 
Lack of effort. Hither because of lack of physical 
energy or constitutional dislike for work, the teacher 
fails. She fails to make the necessary preparation; 
she fails to care for routine matters; she fails to put 
forth tle effort necessary for success. 
Lack of initiative. The teacher does everything that 
she is told to do but does nothing more. She is en- 
tirely incapable of acting upon abstract principles. 
Lack of adaptability, The teacher fails to adapt 
herself to the principal, the other teachers, the com- 
munity, or the pupils. She is a potential trouble- 
maker. She may be good enough in her classroom, 
but she fails to establish proper relations with the 
rest of the building. She is individualistic, generally 
disgruntled, and antagonistic. 
Lack of common sense. The teacher fails to size up 
the situation. She lacks the good judgment to see 
that certain things are out of place. She moves 
either too rapidly or too slowly. She is always in 
difficulties. 
Lack of physical ability. The teacher is in ill health, 
acknowledged or concealed. She may be nervous, 
irritable, or otherwise disagreeable. She may lack 
the physical energy to do good work. 
. Lack of standards. The teacher does not know what is 
expected of her. She is perfectly capable, but does 
not know prevailing standards of teaching. 
. Lack of ability to carry on. The teacher becomes dis- 
couraged at the attitude of the principal, poor work

of pupils, ete. She looks continually for new and 
better pastures. 
Typp 12. Lack of singleness of purpose. The teacher has too 
many outside interests—real estate, family, social 
obligations, ete. She is not willing to share with 
others the many extra burdens and assignments of 
the school. 
Typr 13. Lack of sympathetic understanding of pupils. The 
teacher fails to get the pupils’ point of view. She 
has the wrong attitude. She has lost all recollections 
of the pleasures, wishes, and hopes of childhood. 
She is out of sympathy with those things that chil- 
dren love and cherish most. 
Typr 14. Lack of social background. The teacher fails because 
of a limited social background. The éommunity and 
the children are rich in social experience and are 
aware of the difference. The children laugh at her. 
Typg 15. Lack of knowledge of what pupils can do. The teacher 
does not know what to expect of pupils. She has no 
notion of difficulty levels. She does not know what 
is difficult to the child. She lacks standards of 
judgment. 
Typx 16. Lack of personality. The teacher lacks foree—spiritual, 
social, and physical. She fails to radiate life and 
enthusiasm. : 
Typp 17. Lack of moral standards. The teacher is not honest 
with herself and with other teachers. She fails to 
show moral stamina in her many personal relation- 
ships about the school. 
RemepiaL Measures 
Obviously, to offer solutions for all cases would lead 
one into practically every field of human knowledge. 
The task, however, though difficult, is not impossible. 
There is already available, although often inaccessible, 
considerable literature in the fields of psychology, soci- 
ology, and education, which is applicable to such prob- 
lems. It is not, however, the purpose of the writers, 
were they possessed of the necessary knowledge, to sug-
-P-A-G-E-353
  
REMEDIAL MEASURES 335 
gest detailed training programs and solutions for all of 
these cases. Furthermore, the procedure for solving diffi- 
cult teaching cases has been amply illustrated in the 
foregoing chapters and may be applied to other types 
of failures. To discuss these several problems specifically 
would lead one far afield and into the consideration of 
many means of training other than the constructive 
criticism of teaching. The following discussion of remedial 
measures for each type of failure is based partly on 
experience, partly on the returns of a questionnaire from 
supervisors of instruction, and partly on psychological 
principles applied from other fields of learning. 
The paragraphs are in no sense complete treatment 
but should serve as a basis for further analysis and 
study. 
Type 1. Lack of Control over the Technique of Teaching 
This type needs no further discussion here. How to 
study the work of the teacher, how to help the teacher, 
and how to plan follow-up conferences and preteaching 
conferences has been discussed in the preceding chapters. 
In general, the procedures applied there to the technique 
of teaching apply to this and all succeeding types of 
failures. : 
Type 2. Lack of Ability to Maintain Order and Discipline 
1. Remember to tell the teacher that good discipline 
is a by-product of mental alertness. To keep the class 
mentally alert observe the following maxims: 
(a) Begin the class exercise with vigor and promptness; e.g. 
with a brief group test in which all participate. 
(b) Strive to keep each member of the class busy during the 
entire period; for example, have extra work ready for 
those who finish before the others. 
(c) Have some system of holding every member of the class
-P-A-G-E-354
336 
(a) 
2. 
  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
responsible for all that takes place during the class period; 
for example, use the plan of requiring each to pass judg- 
ment upon what is said by the one reciting. 
The teacher must hear all and see all that is happening 
in the class all of the time (Colvin). Learn to look at 
the class instead of at a single individual. 
Remember to tell the teacher that, if punishment 
must be used, the following maxims of discipline are 
important: 
(a) 
(0) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
(9) 
(h) 
(i) 
(9) The teacher should always strive to enforce the control 
of his class by indirect means. Keep the work going 
and expect obedience to rule. 
If direct control is necessary, punishment should be 
avoided whenever results can be accomplished by other 
means. Try to remove the cause for disorder rather than 
punish for it. 
When punishment is necessary, it should be administered 
with vigor. Be reasonable, but be thorough and make sure 
that you really punish the pupil and not make him a 
martyr in the eyes of his mates. 
Artificial punishment should strive to combine in itself 
all of the advantages of natural punishment, at the same 
time avoiding its obvious defects. 
Punishment must impress the offender as having a moral 
implication. He must realize that the wrongdoing is 
what merited the punishment. 
The teacher should administer his own discipline as far as 
possible. 
The teacher should discuss his disciplinary problems 
frankly with principal, supervisor, or critic. 
The most effective form of punishment is social in char- 
acter; i.e. the pupil senses that he has violated the rights 
of others in some way, or has, through his act, lost for 
the time his group privilege. 
In dealing with cases\of discipline the teacher must act 
with decision and promptness. If too long delayed the 
cause is forgotten by the pupil. 
As a rule it is not wise to punish the group for the con- 
duct of the individual (Colvin). 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
  
REMEDIAL MEASURES 337 
8. In determining what is to be done, the teacher 
should be guided by such commonly accepted principles 
as the following: 
(a) The punishment should be adjusted to the offense, the 
motive behind it, and the pupil. 
(b) The punishment should be fair and just to a reasonable 
pupil and closely associated with the offense. 
(c) Unless a frank talk and an admonition are considered 
sufficient, which may be the case with certain first 
offenders, the punishment ought to cause the pupil some 
real discomfort. 
(d) Avoid using threats, school tasks, taking away earned 
marks, personal indignities, sarcasm, ridicule, or in- 
ordinate punishment as penalties. 
(e) Among desirable means are deprivation of privileges, 
isolation, restitution, public apology, appeal to public 
opinion, reports to parents, assignment to a special class, 
corporal punishment, suspension, and, in extreme cases, 
expulsion. 
(f) Do not give any decision or administer any punishment 
impulsively. The attitude toward the offender is impor- 
tant. Punishments should be impersonal, distinct, delib- 
erate, and decisive (Cubberley). 
4. Remember to tell the teacher that discipline is 
closely related to the economy of time in classroom man- 
agement: Does the teacher start the class exercises on 
time? Does the teacher collect and distribute papers 
with a minimum loss of time? (See the ‘‘Items to 
Observe,’’ pages 11-13, for a complete list.) 
5. Cubberley has summarized as follows the procedure 
for strengthening the teacher in government: 
(a) Give her very practical suggestions for improvement out 
of your own experience as a teacher. 
(b) Caution her to make few rules, but having made a rule 
to insist upon a reasonable compliance with it. 
(c) Caution her against making rules involving definite pun- 
ishments for misbehavior. The pupils may decide that

  VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
the fun is worth the pain. Punishments should come as 
surprises. 
Caution her to say what she means and to mean what she 
says. Do not try to discipline a school with a continual 
volley of don’ts; do not tell pupils twice; do not try to 
bluff the American boy; and do not be bluffed by him. 
Do not let her start out either too severely or too easily. 
The one leads to the martinet, and the other to the easy, 
moush, “golden-ruler” who soon forms an easy mark for 
the mischievous and unruly pupils. If she learns from 
the first to keep cool, to be sympathetic, but to temper 
her kindness and sympathy with firmness and at times 
with the exhibition of a little “nerve,” few pupils will 
eare to bother her long. 
Try to keep the beginner from worry and despondence. 
She needs all her energy for her teaching problems. 
When you visit the room be careful to let the pupils see 
that you refer continually to her as in control. Never 
eriticize her before the pupils. 
Use your influence to build up in her class a kind of pride 
in the success of that particular class. Stress the fact 
that class comparisons are made, and show the pupils 
what they need to do to bring their room up. They will 
usually respond. 
Show the teacher that her strongest ally is public opinion 
within the schoolroom itself. If she assumes that the 
offender is on one side against the other pupils and her- 
self, this alignment is likely to be a strong factor in her 
favor. 
Remember that a well-taught school is usually an orderly 
school, and strive most of all to build up the teacher in 
teaching skill. In particular, show her how to strengthen 
the mechanized routine of the school. Have her grasp the 
idea that she is there primarily as a teacher, and that if 
she teaches well the discipline will be reduced to a 
minimum. 
Locate the weak points in her control, and give her maga- 
zine articles or a book to read which will be helpful to her. 
Give her a few half days for visiting, and let her see other 
teachers at work who do not have her defects. If there is 
a demonstration teacher or a training teacher employed by
-P-A-G-E-357
  
REMEDIAL MEASURES 339 
the school system, arrange for her to visit the teacher and 
offer help. 
Type 3. Lack of Mastery of Subject Matter 
1. Convince the teacher of her lack of subject matter. 
Carefully check all misstatement of facts, and point out 
the contrast between her knowledge and an acceptable 
standard. 
2. One of the most effective devices for overcoming 
teaching difficulties due to the lack of control over sub- 
ject matter is to require detailed lesson plans. The pro- 
cedure is outlined on pages 262-294. 
8. Plan an extensive reading course for self-improve- 
ment in subject matter. 
4. Suggest that the teacher attend evening-school 
classes, summer school, or enroll in correspondence 
courses. 
5. Sometimes when the teacher is well trained in one 
field and not in another, the matter can be handled 
administratively by dividing the work among two or three 
teachers, allowing each to teach those subjects for which 
she is best prepared. 
Type 4. Lack of Intelligence 
Of course, as a rule, because of the selective process 
going on in the school system through which the teacher 
has come, only those of average ability and above will 
ever reach teaching positions. One supervisor suggests, 
“The supervisor should investigate other lines of work 
into which the teacher can profitably enter, confer with 
her, and make an earnest effort to initiate her into an- 
other line of work. If this fails, a recommendation that 
she be dropped must be made.’’ Another supervisor says, 
“‘This deficiency is well nigh impossible to overcome. If 
convinced that the handicap is a permanent one, the  
-P-A-G-E-358
  340 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
supervisor should ask to have the teacher replaced.’’ An- 
other suggested a like procedure: ‘‘The only possible 
course is to eliminate the teacher. In two cases that fell 
under my observation, the teachers were given clerk- 
ships.’’ 
Type 5. Lack of Effort 
The two factors-contributing chiefly to lack of effort 
are lack of interest and lack of energy and vitality. 
1. A lack of interest is sometimes due to a lack of 
driving, motive force in teaching. All achievements are 
based upon interests and desires. The strength of the 
desire is measured by the feeling of the value of the goal 
to be attained. If that value is appreciated, purposing 
and planning to attain the goal will follow. 
The mere explaining of a given course of action is not 
an effective means of bringing teachers to realize its 
value. Interest is more easily aroused when tangible 
results are observable. 
The results of standard tests that show the standings 
in other classes are ofttimes effective in bringing a teacher 
to a realization of her shortcomings. 
Placing such a teacher in a group of thoroughly alert 
and interested teachers is effective, for social pressure 
from one’s immediate associates is a powerful influence 
upon action. 
The opportunity to the seemingly uninterested teacher 
to do a special piece of experimental work in the field in 
which she is nearest to success has frequently changed her 
entire attitude toward teaching. 
Frequent objective measurements of pupil progress 
and of teaching technique serve to help such a teacher 
to maintain interest over a period sufficiently long to 
really cause a permanent change. For example, show 
pupil attainment in subject matter month by month by
-P-A-G-E-359
  REMEDIAL MEASURES 341 
means of graphs. Measure objectively certain items of 
teaching technique and graph the results, such as time 
consumed in routine matters of management: October, 
25 per cent; November, 22 per cent, and December, 20 
per cent. 
Visit frequently the teacher who lacks interest, and 
let her tell about her successes in pupil achievement and 
in teaching devices or plans. 
Ask her to take part in the general building adminis- 
tration, and be sure that she is made to realize that her 
full support is required to make the school a success. 
Be very sure that the teacher who manifests lack of 
interest is given all of the required tools with which to 
work so that there is no opportunity for excuses on her 
part. 
Make sure that such a teacher is held strictly to the 
demands of the school in regard to all routine matters, 
and give special attention to her advance plans to safe- 
guard her from failure whenever possible. 
Interest can be stimulated by appealing to: (1) the 
sense of rivalry, (2) fear of physical or social discom- 
fiture, and (3) such instincts as mental activity, curiosity, 
the collecting instinct, manipulation, communication, and 
cooperation. 
2. If the teacher lacks energy and vitality: 
(a) Suggest a thorough physical and medical examination. 
(b) Suggest specific health habits. 
(c) Suggest, if the case warrants, that health is not merely 
a matter of “keeping well.” Through the force of 
physiological habits most individuals work far below 
potential working levels. 
Praise every show of robust attempt at work, and 
express confidence in the teacher’s ability to achieve. 
Bring the teacher into association with the ambitious, 
peppy, live-wires of the teaching group. Enthusiasm 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
  342 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
and energy is contagious. Work sympathetically; strive 
to convince the teacher that you have her welfare at 
heart. 
Type 6. Lack of Initiative 
1. Initiative is at least nine parts interest. Arouse the 
teacher’s interest in things. In this connection reread 
the section on ‘‘Lack of effort.’ 
2. Stimulate the teacher to see problems. Set the 
example by adopting the experimental attitude. Stimu- 
late the teacher to try all kinds of experiments. Motivate 
the work as explained in Type 5. 
8. The lack of initiative may be a matter of lack of 
capacity. Deal with concrete situations as suggested 
under Type 4. 
4. Have the teacher visit teachers with marked reso- 
lution, versatility, and individuality. Sometimes the 
spirit is contagious. 
5. Work out a course of reading, telling of the con- 
tributions of teachers to the improvement of teaching. 
6. Failing to stimulate the teacher, (a) transfer to 
subjects where least damage will be done; (b) place 
in the hands of the teacher a carefully planned course 
of study. 
Type 7. Lack of Adaptability 
1. The lack of adaptability is a social disorder. It may 
manifest itself in many different directions. Ascertain 
first the specific directions in which the tendency is 
evidenced. 
2. Analyze the case into its specific elements, and 
deal with each element separately. 
8. A plain discussion of the situation is often help- 
ful. Remember that an individual may be adaptable in 
one direction and quite inadaptable in another. To say
-P-A-G-E-361
  REMEDIAL MEASURES 343 
that an individual does not adapt himself may not be 
true. 
4. Maintain an attitude of helpfulness. The teacher 
may be quite as anxious as the supervisor to do the right 
thing. Most people do right as they see it. 
5. Occasionally utilize social pressure from the imme- 
diate associates of the offending individual. 
6. One supervisor suggests, ‘‘Such a person is self- 
centered and hard to work with, but a good friend may 
do much.’’ 
7. ‘If she is still young, she may be helped; if be- 
yond forty, it is doubtful if she can be permanently 
helped. If the former, a frank talk with the teacher 
pointed with specific examples is valuable. Encourage the 
teacher to keep a score card of her own deficiencies of 
this particular type. She can only be led to help herself.’’ 
Type 8. Lack of Common Sense 
Type 8 is a difficult but a rather ordinary type of 
shortcoming. It would seem that the difficulty is in part 
temperamental, and in part due to inexperience or faulty 
training. Many individuals do not know how to conduct 
themselves in a given situation because they have not had 
sufficient experience in dealing with similar situations. 
The learning period can be shortened by making avail- 
able to them the course of action of others in such situ- 
ations. In part the shortcoming is the result of faulty 
analysis and generalization of past experiences. One 
may react to a given situation over and over again with- 
out being aware that the reaction was not wholly suc- 
cessful. The experience goes by without analysis and 
consequently without improvement. Just because a teacher 
does not have the knack of doing the proper thing at 
the proper time does not mean that the difficulty is con- 
stitutional. Counsel with the teacher. Lead her to see  
-P-A-G-E-362
  344 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
the full consequences of her action before acting. Try 
to assist her to form friendships with well-poised people 
of her own age who will help her to consider before she 
acts and to judge her acts as a basis for subsequent be- 
havior. Occasionally a case of this kind is traceable to 
overwork, rundown physical condition, ete. Such physical 
factors seem to limit the field of marginal ideas and there 
is a consequent limitation of judgment. 
Type 9. Lack of Physical Ability 
See section on physical ability, Type 5, and the diag- 
nostic materials, Chapter II. 
Type 10. Lack of Standards 
Many an inexperienced teacher will reply, and honestly, | 
when criticized for poor work, that she thought she was 
doing acceptable teaching. Common as this shortcoming 
is, the remedy is simple enough. Give the teacher a 
standard to go by: (a) through demonstrations of accept- 
able teaching done in the building; (b) through the study 
and development of suitable lesson plans; (c) through a 
study of the standards for the improvement of teaching; 
(d) through opportunities to observe expert teaching. 
Type 11. Lack of Ability to Carry On 
Many individuals have this fault. As a matter of fact, 
most individuals have it to a certain extent. Once the situy 
ation is discovered, the solution is to give encouragement, 
Not only speak encouragingly about the situation but help 
the teacher to make the situation an encouraging one. 
Very few individuals can carry on any considerable 
length of time without an expression of interest and 
appreciation from some source. The principal, super- 
visor, or critic should above all things be a source of 
inspiration to those with whom they work. Occasionally
-P-A-G-E-363
  ee Teer 
REMEDIAL MEASURES 345 
one discovers a case where the difficulty is constitutional. 
It appears usually during the latter part of the year in 
the form of a request for a transfer to different work 
within the building or to another school within the 
system. Probably the best procedure then is to ‘‘point 
out squarely and frankly her deficiencies and encourage 
her to cultivate a hopeful attitude. Lead her to see that 
the ‘rainbow chaser’ seldom arrives at the coveted goal.’’   
      
Type 12. Lack of Singleness of Purpose 
Failures of this type are rather common. Some indi- 
viduals are always in financial embarrassment, either real 
or imagined. Others are interested in money-making but 
do not care to hazard everything in a business venture 
and consequently teach as a certain source of income. 
It is usually not to the interest of the school to have 
teachers selling insurance, dabbling in real estate, and 
working on Saturdays and Sundays at odd jobs. Other 
types of this difficulty are those where the responsibil- 
ities of the home are great, where social engagements 
are pressing, ete. Usually if the work is satisfactory the 
situation is overlooked. To take this course is to miss 
the point. The teacher should be led to feel that the 
privilege of doing her work is paramount to all other 
interests. Lead her to see the full consequences of a 
divided interest, and insist upon the teacher’s giving at 
least a sufficient portion of the day for the average school 
needs. 
Type 18. Lack of Sympathetic Understanding of Pupils 
1. Remember that education is not merely a matter 
of ‘‘book learning.’’ Appeal to the teacher to give her- 
self and her experience to the children. 
2. Suggest that the teacher read books of child life, 
such as Canfield’s Understood Betsy, Walpole’s Jeremy, 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
346 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, War- 
ner’s Being a Boy, ete. 
8. A mastery of a book such as Norsworthy and Whit- 
ley’s Psychology of Childhood is helpful. 
4. Give the teacher responsibilities where she will be 
brought frequently in touch with the children outside 
the classroom. 
5. Suggest that the teacher spend an occasional play 
period with the children of her room. 
6. Try to lead the teacher to see the point of view 
of the child. 
7. Urge the teacher to know her pupils personally and 
individually. 
8. Suggest that the teacher follow the practice of hay- 
ing at least one pupil each day tell her some interesting 
experience—a ball game, a sleigh ride, ete. 
9. Suggest that the teacher visit the parents. See chil- 
dren as parents see them. 
10. Select as a companion and friend some younger 
individual full of life, enthusiasm, and hope. 
Type 14. Lack of Social Background 
Many failures are traceable to social shortcomings: 
(1) poor manners, (2) unsuitable dress, (3) errors of 
speech, (4) lack of knowledge of social practices, ete. 
As a rule these deficiencies are regarded as sacred and 
personal, and consequently not discussed. The tradition 
being so, any diseussion of social shortcomings must be 
done most tactfully. 
1. Lead the teacher sincerely to feel that you have 
her interest clearly at heart. 
2. If the situation permits, point out tactfully the par- 
ticular shortcoming and suggest the remedial measures. 
3. Suggest study and attention to matters of dress, 
speech, manners, ete. 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  REMEDIAL MEASURES 347 
4. Urge and assist the teacher to enrich and broaden 
her social contacts. 
5. Urge her to read, study, and travel. 
6. Urge her to companionship of the desired type and 
to attention to social activities. 
Type 15. Lack of Knowledge of What Pupils Can Do 
The best solution of a situation of this type would seem 
to be to get the facts. Study with the teacher (1) typi- 
eal assignments, (2) the average time spent on the 
assignments per pupil, (3) the average mastery level per 
assignment. Suggest that the instruction be adapted to 
the ability of the individual pupils by assigning extra 
work for those who finish group assignments. 
Type 16. Lack of Personality 
Personality is a general term used to include most of 
those intangible qualities that give forcefulness and effec- 
tiveness to individuals. Probably it is the total effect of 
many things acceptably done. Although it is true that 
personality is enriched through travel, study, and com- 
panionship, improvements are probably specific. At least 
as far as the school is concerned, concrete suggestions are 
most effective. 
The following have been used successfully : 
1. Cultivate erect posture. 
2. Look at your class a moment or two before speaking to 
them. 
. Look directly at persons when addressing them. 
. Work as rapidly as efficiency will permit. 
. Dress the hair more becomingly. 
. Wear colors (when appropriate). 
. Study your physical type and be sure your dress capitalizes 
_ your type. 
. Know at least one topic of general interest well enough to 
talk about it with confidence.

9. Make yourself take an active part in social life. 
10. Act the part of a dynamic person until you become one. 
Type 17. Lack of Moral Standards 
The comments of three supervisors cover the situation: 
1. ‘‘A well-nigh impossible handicap and if deeply 
rooted should be cause for dismissal.’’ 
2. ‘‘Miss B was of this type. She was transferred to 
a principal who took interest in the case, and promptly 
checked any tendency to error. The girl has overcome 
past deficiencies.’’ 
8. ‘‘Such a teacher needs to be confronted with her 
misdemeanors, probably by the principal, and shown 
specifically what she must do in order to be acceptable 
as a member of the teaching corps.’’

  CHAPTER XII 
PROBLEMS IN THE CRITICISM OF TEACHING 
In the preceding chapters most of the methods in com- 
mon use in supervision were described both generally and 
specifically. Instructors charged with the training of 
superintendents, principals, grade and departmental 
supervisors, and critic teachers in the theory of supervi- 
sion may care to test the effectiveness of their teaching 
or may desire to bridge the gap between theory and 
practice through the study of conerete cases. The case 
method is by no means new. The best law schools, the 
medical schools, and the military schools have used suc- 
cessfully the case method of training. It is the purpose 
of this chapter to list for study and analysis a number 
of cases as reported by experienced supervisors. 
The procedure recommended to students is as follows: 
1. Study the data carefully. 
2. List the known facts. 
3. List conditions not stated, a knowledge of which is necessary 
for a complete solution of the case. 
. List facts known or assumed in your solution of the case. 
. State your diagnosis of the case. 
. Outline remedial measures. 
. Cite scientific evidence or practice to support conclusions. Noopyp 
Case 1 
A teacher of history had the idea that children should 
be paid for all the work they did. She kept her grade 
ibook open, and as she asked pupils questions based on 
349
-P-A-G-E-368
350 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
memory of the text, she marked the answer in her book 
on a basis of 1 to 10. Children complained that they 
“‘Inew the lesson but couldn’t recite’’ because they were 
afraid. A conference with the teacher failed to change 
her plan. She honestly felt that her method was a valu- 
able device in teaching, for, as she said, ‘‘It made for 
thoroughness.’’ She resented the ‘‘interference.’’ 
1. How would you proceed with a case of this type? 
2. What would you say to the teacher? 
3. How would you word the comments that you have to offer? 
4, What would you do, first, second, ete., until the difficulty is 
overcome? 
Case 2 
Two teachers had been given charge of writing in the 
third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade rooms. Although the scores 
in the initial tests approximated the city median, it was 
clearly evident after five weeks’ work that the writing 
in several of the rooms was not up to the standard. The 
children were not purposing, their habits of work were 
not good, and there was little self-appraisal in the prac- 
tice work. 
1. How would you proceed with a case of this type? 
2. Outline your solution step by step. 
Case 3 i 
A superintendent found on going to the records of 
the previous year that his teachers had varied greatly 
in grading. The grades when graphed and compared with 
a normal curve were greatly skewed. Frequently a given 
class which was graded high in one subject was graded 
low in another. It was evident that there was no uni- 
formity of grading among the teachers. The superin- 
tendent carefully graphed the yearly averages for the 
classes in arithmetic. After school started he gave tests
-P-A-G-E-369
  PROBLEMS IN CRITICISM 351 
to several classes and collected the papers. These were 
numbered and passed out again for teachers to grade. 
A careful graph of the grades assigned to these papers 
showed great variation! Graphs made for the previous 
year’s work were also presented. Very little was said. 
Several copies of reports covering similar experiments, 
namely, those of Monroe and Starch, were distributed. 
A third meeting was called a week later at which there 
was a general discussion of the findings and personal 
conclusions. 
1. Do you agree with this superintendent’s method of handling 
the case? 
2. What are the elements of strength and the elements of weak- 
ness in his procedure? 
3. How would you, as superintendent of schools, have handled 
this case? 
Case 4 
The case is one of a second-year cadet teaching in 
grades 2A and 3B. In spite of poor quality of teaching, 
she made a’ splendid personal appeal to pupils and 
accordingly had little disciplinary difficulty. The pupils 
were quiet but often unoccupied. The teacher’s lesson 
showed very meager preparation, and her plans were 
mere schedules of work to be done. There was a lack 
of stimulation and little purposeful activity on the part 
of the pupils. The lessons were a series of isolated tasks. 
Repeated conferences and discussions only placed the 
teacher on the defensive. Supervisors called in for help 
made little impression. 
1. What do you think was the teacher’s real difficulty? 
2. Why in your judgment did the supervisors’ conferences 
make little impression? 
3. How would you proceed with the case were you called in 
as consulting specialist after the supervisor had failed?
-P-A-G-E-370
  352 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Case 5 
A teacher had failed and as a result was transferred 
to another building. She went to the principal and told 
her that she thought she would resign and take up some 
other line of work. The teacher was very much discour- 
aged and felt that there was no hope for her. She said 
that she had been told so many times by her former prin- 
cipals that everything she did was wrong, that she felt 
that she would not be able to do any better in her new 
work. Her English also was very poor and her scholar- 
ship below standard. The principal, feeling that the 
teacher was young, and being otherwise favorably im- 
pressed, wanted to help her. 
1. What would be your diagnosis of a case of this sort? 
2. What procedure would you, as principal, pursue? 
Case 6 
The teacher’s chief interest was in hand work. As a 
matter of fact, she took all her time for this work, at 
times leaving her own room in order to help other pupils. 
The room suffered. Frequently when the principal vis- 
ited the room no teacher was found in charge. Her 
pupils, compared with two other third-grade classes in 
the building, were poor. The teacher’s attitude toward 
supervision was good, but she persisted in her interest 
in hand work and art. 
1. Was this teacher a failure? 
2. How would you, as principal, proceed with a case of this 
type? 
Case 7 
A teacher came to the superintendent asking for a 
transfer to ‘‘any other room’’ in the system. She had 
no complaint to make against the principal. He had in
-P-A-G-E-371
  PROBLEMS IN CRITICISM 353 
no way interfered with the work. Upon inquiry it was 
found that the room conditions baffled the teacher and 
that the pupils were apparently poorly prepared. The — 
room was largely one of below-normal children. 
1. What should the superintendent say to this teacher? 
2. What would you, as principal, say to the teacher on being 
informed of the teacher’s difficulties? 
3. In case the teacher remains in the building, how would you, 
as principal, proceed with the case? 
Case 8 
A certain otherwise well-qualified teacher had the habit 
of nagging pupils—a-whining attitude. This antagonized 
the pupils. One pupil somewhat older than the others 
told the principal of the difficulty. The principal, be- 
cause of the teacher’s high scholastic standing, was 
anxious to retain her. Because of the temperamental 
nature of the teacher he was at a loss how to proceed. 
1. What should the principal say to the pupil? 
2. How would you, as principal, proceed with a solution of the 
case? © 
8. Report in detail your initial interview with the teacher. 
Case 9 
A third-grade teacher failed to get good results in read- 
ing. The discipline was good and the attitude of the 
pupils toward the teacher, excellent. Most of the pupils 
who were called upon to read, read poorly, and few 
pupils were sufficiently interested to follow what was 
being read. The supervisor visited the room and found 
the percentage of attention very low. 
1. What was this teacher’s difficulty? 
2. What would you, as supervisor, say to the teacher at the 
end of the recitation? 
3. What step would you take to help this teacher to better 
teaching?
-P-A-G-E-372
  354 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
Case 10 
This teacher had a habit of lecturing most of the study 
period and recitation period. Furthermore, he talked in 
a monotone. He was, however, earnest and well educated. 
His zeal for the subject overcame his better judgment. 
He was trying to teach too much in one period. He had 
taught a little in a normal school and felt rather proud 
of his reputation. The pupils plainly were not succeed- 
ing. They even complained to the principal and super- 
visors that the teacher talked too much. The principal 
made kindly suggestions, but to no avail. Finally the 
supervisor was called to help out. 
1. What information would you like to have before proceeding 
with a solution? 
. Why do you suppose that the principal had failed? 
. Outline your first interview with the teacher. 
. What other steps would you take to overcome the difficulty? He

Case 11 
A young man, just out of a college of liberal arts, was 
engaged to teach history. His training was good in sub- 
ject matter but poor in methods of teaching. He was 
likable, a ready speaker, and did most of the talking in 
the class. The better students got along fairly well, but 
the average and slower ones had a difficult time. The 
teacher used college methods. 
1. What are college methods? 
2. What would you say to the teacher after your first visit? 
3. What procedure would you follow in making this young man 
an acceptable teacher of history? 
Case 12 
A married woman who had taught in the second grade 
for sixteen years gave too much phonics. The third-grade
-P-A-G-E-373
PROBLEMS IN CRITICISM 855 
teacher complained that the children were word-readers. 
The second-grade teacher had always been very consid- 
erate of the welfare of her children, was kind to them, 
and consequently had many friends in the community. 
The principal visited her room and was very much 
chagrined at her methods of teaching. He was called to 
his office before the close of the recitation but left a note 
on the teacher’s desk saying that her methods were poor 
and that she should try to improve them. 
1. Was the teacher’s method of teaching poor? 
2. What conditions should the principal expect to find on his 
next visit? 
3. What will be the probable reaction of the teacher to the 
note? 
4. Do you consider the principal’s procedure effective? 
5. How would you handle a similar case? 
Case 13 
The principal of an elementary school of 250 pupils 
was fully convinced after several visits to a certain 
eighth grade that the teacher was using methods of 
teaching considered good a generation or so ago. The 
only redeeming feature was her discipline. The teacher 
was somewhat of a leader in the school, and the prin- 
cipal was anxious to convince her of her deficiencies 
without antagonizing her. 
1. What procedure would you recommend? 
2. What should the principal say to the teacher in the first 
conference? 
3. Outline the procedure that you would consider most effective. 
Case 14 
A beginning teacher showed evidence of poor prepara- 
tion. There seemed to be little organization in the work 
of the class. Although the teacher was very attractive
-P-A-G-E-374
  356 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
personally, and the discipline in the classroom fair, the 
work was poor. The principal discovered after some 
investigation that this teacher was very popular socially 
and spent many evenings at the theater, dance, ete. He 
was anxious to help her become a successful teacher. 
1. How should the teacher be approached? 
2. What should the principal say in the initial interview? 
3. How would you, as principal of the school, handle the case? 
Case 15 
A young normal-school graduate with the regular 
amount of practice teaching was assigned to a first-grade 
room. Her instructor in the training school had developed 
a very elaborate reading technique which the teacher 
attempted to follow. This seemed to lead to difficulties. 
Her work was formal, notwithstanding the modern train- 
ing that she had received. The principal felt that some- 
thing would have to be done to assist the teacher. 
1. What should the principal say to the teacher at the end of 
his first visit? 
2. What was the probable difficulty of this teacher? 
3. What procedure should the principal pursue? 
Case 16 
A teacher of the old order with fifteen years’ experi- 
ence made serious objection to the use of standardized 
tests. She referred to standardized tests as ‘‘fads’’ and 
as devised for advertising and enriching the makers. She 
condemned the tests because they did not measure the 
“finer, more intangible results that come from good | 
teaching.’’ The other teachers of the faculty were largely 
influenced by the attitude of this one teacher, and were 
themselves entirely ignorant of standardized tests and the 
development of the whole testing movement. This teacher 
|
-P-A-G-E-375

was an effective barrier to the introduction of any testing 
in the school. 
1. How would you, as principal of the school, handle such a 
case? 
Case 17 
An immature girl, directly from a kindergarten training 
school, was assigned to a two-session kindergarten position 
in a well-equipped school. In spite of the fact that she had 
had excellent training and came with superior recommen- 
dations, she seemed unable to apply her knowledge to meet 
the present situation. 
After two weeks had elapsed the principal visited the 
room and found the children doing whatever they pleased. 
The teacher appeared unable to guide their energies into 
purposeful activities. There was no kindergarten super- 
visor in the school system. 
1. What were probably the teacher’s specific shortcomings? 
2. What advice would you give to the principal in handling 
such cases? 
3. What course of action would you recommend in this par- 
ticular case? 
Case 18 
An inexperienced teacher of music had trouble with 
discipline. The noise of the pupils was such that it 
was difficult to make her directions understood. Although 
the teacher brought books from a storeroom which was 
immediately adjoining the classroom, the class was in 
an uproar before she could return. Order was obtained 
only after several attempts. Usually before a song could 
be chosen the class was again in disorder. The teacher 
finally appealed to the supervisor for assistance.

Case 19 
An experienced sixth-grade teacher found her class 
poor in spelling. She gave them thorough drill, kept a 
number of the pupils after school, and did all that she 
eould to improve their work. Their written work was 
continually poor. 
1. How would you diagnose this situation? 
2. How would you proceed to remedy the situation? 
Case 20 
An eighth-grade teacher experienced difficulty in arous- 
ing in her pupils interest in American history. She was 
herself very much interested in the subject. The pupils 
studied the lesson, answered the teacher’s questions with 
fair success, but put forth little independent effort. Most 
of the pupils made a creditable showing on monthly exam- 
inations but soon forgot most of what they had learned. 
The teacher was discouraged and made an appeal for 
assistance. 
1. What was this teacher’s difficulty? 
2, What remedial measures would you suggest? 
. Case 21 
A grade supervisor began her work in a city system 
where the superintendent had previously depended upon 
supervising principals for direction and improvement of 
teaching. This supervisor found that although a modern 
system of primary reading was in use, the accomplish- 
ment in the amount actually read in the first grade was 
far below that of surrounding cities. 
The pupils of the schools were of American and foreign 
parentage, depending upon the location of the school. 
They varied greatly in their ability to make progress in 
reading. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
  PROBLEMS IN CRITICISM 359 
The supervisor sent a questionnaire to fifteen cities of 
approximately the same size as the one in which she 
worked, and ascertained their standards of accomplish- 
ment. 
The findings were tabulated and given to the teachers. 
Upon the basis of these tabulations there was proposed 
to the teachers a very reasonable median, maximum, and 
minimum accomplishment expressed in terms of books to 
be completed for both 1B and 1A Grades. At the same 
time, each building was supplied with sets of the supple- 
mentary readers selected in part with reference to a 
common vocabulary. The proposed advance in the require- 
ments for average and strong pupils reached the teachers 
before the beginning of the second semester. They were | 
asked to send to the supervisor reactions to the plan and 
suggested modifications. 
Of the thirty teachers of Grade 1, all but one accepted 
the plan and began at once to group their pupils upon 
the basis of their progress. One experienced and capable 
teacher expressed her honest opposition to the change. 
She said that it was better for children to know one book 
thoroughly in the 1B Grade than two or three books super- 
ficially, and that she had found from experience that 
children read better in later grades when thoroughly 
grounded in the fundamentals. She did not believe in 
sectioning, and when she promoted a class one child knew 
as much as another. This teacher continued to follow her 
plan during the second semester. 
1. Was the supervisor correct in assuming that the standards 
might with profit be changed? Why? 
2. Was the supervisor’s method of going about the matter of 
changing standards a good one? 
3. How should the supervisor proceed with the teacher who was 
not convinced? 
4. Outline the procedure in detail.

Case 22 
A state supervisor visited a mature teacher for the first 
time. The teacher had just been placed in the position. 
The school was organized on a departmental basis, and 
the teacher was responsible for the work in English in 
the seventh and eighth grades. The class period was sixty 
minutes in length. Although the teacher had taught in 
a small school system in which the language arts—read- 
ing, spelling, handwriting, and language—were taught as 
separate subjects, she was very much at a loss to know 
how to proceed in the new situation. There was no de- 
tailed course of study. She had merely taught grammar 
to both seventh- and eighth-grade pupils for the first six 
weeks. 
As the supervisor greeted her, the teacher said, ‘‘Oh, 
will you take this class and will you tell me what to do? 
What am I to teach these pupils and how can I do it 
all in one hour a day and still have them study part of 
the time?’’ 
1. Should the supervisor take the class? Explain. 
2. What can the supervisor do to be of most assistance to this 
teacher in the hour at his disposal? 
3. What solution would you recommend for this case? 
Case 23 
A beginning teacher, who was graduated from a normal 
school that afforded opportunities for practice work in 
the grades, was placed in the fourth grade of a school 
in the manufacturing section of an eastern city. The prin- 
cipal also was new, and the pupils were children who 
spoke a foreign language at home. Many were retarded 
because of language difficulties. There was a detailed 
course of study, and the organization of the school sys- 
tem was very complete. 
Almost at the very beginning this teacher met serious
-P-A-G-E-379
  PROBLEMS IN CRITICISM 361 
difficulties in discipline, notwithstanding the fact that the 
normal school regarded her class control as excellent. 
These pupils were different. The principal’s word had 
little more weight with them than that of the teacher. 
The teacher resigned at the end of the fourth week and 
begged to be allowed to go home. 
The grade supervisor came to her aid and urged her 
to try one more month of teaching. The supervisor 
praised her grasp of the many details of the school sys- 
tem and her well-organized lesson plans. The supervisor 
offered to teach from the teacher’s own plans on Monday. 
The supervisor met with hearty response from the 
pupils. She treated the teacher as a coworker and in- 
eluded her in every activity. The day passed with almost 
perfect codperation on the part of the pupils. The next 
day they were as bad as ever. The supervisor returned 
and sent the teacher to visit an experienced teacher with 
similar problems. The supervisor continued to visit for 
a few moments each day for a week or so to say a few 
words of encouragement. The teacher gradually grew in 
ability to meet the situations. The principal, too, had 
offered suggestions to this teacher to aid her in her dis- 
cipline. However, the suggestions given by the super- 
visor were seldom in agreement with those of the prin- 
cipal. The teacher learned to depend upon the supervisor 
and therefore came to regard the principal as an amateur 
like herself. 
1. Was the method used by the supervisor justifiable? Give 
reasons. 
2. How should the supervisor have planned her activities to 
strengthen the principal’s hold upon the situation and upon 
this teacher? 
3. What should the principal have done to win this teacher’s 
confidence? 
4. Is this case a typical one? Why?

Case 24 
A supervisor was convinced that a certain method of 
teaching spelling was superior to that used by a group 
of recent graduates from a very progressive normal school. 
The supervisor had no objective proofs for her opinion, 
but she felt that theoretically it must be so. She called 
a building meeting and expressed interest in the vast 
amount of scientific data now available in the field of 
spelling. She outlined the two methods of spelling, com- 
pared them in the light of recent investigations, and 
asked for volunteers to try her plan. 
About one-half of the teachers were willing to try it. 
She asked the remainder of the teachers to continue their 
present methods. She then outlined a plan for computing 
the percentage of correctness in spelling for a three-month 
period for each grade. | 
The principal of the building was in hearty accord 
with the supervisor and gave direct supervision to the 
experiment. 
The outcome on a standard test was a decidedly higher 
percentage of correctness for those classes that had fol- 
lowed the supervisor’s plan. The teachers who had fol- 
lowed the normal-school plan were convinced of the 
advantages of the supervisor’s method. 
1. Was this supervisor justified in discrediting the teaching 
plan of a normal school on the basis of one experiment? 
Why? 
2. Were these teachers strengthened or weakened in their desire 
for professional growth by this experience? Explain. 
3. What should be the supervisor’s next step in improving the 
teaching of spelling in this city?

Case 25 | 
A child was transferred from one 1A Grade to another 
in the same city. His reading and word-study were

regarded as very good. The teacher who received the 
child felt that he could do only fair 1B work. The child 
was known to have passed the intelligence tests with 
credit. The supervisor was called to decide his place- 
ment. 
1. What questions did this raise in the supervisor’s mind? 
2. What should be done with the child? 
3. What measures should be taken to insure the greatest benefit 
to the school system from this incident? 
Case 26 
A dependable teacher of experience, who had received 
her training before the days of silent reading, was teach- 
ing reading in the good old-fashioned way. The pupils 
read orally every day, one after another, around the class. 
They then told briefly what they had read, or asked 
others to do so. 
The supervisor wished to change this teacher’s notion 
of reading. She asked her to read Germane and Germane, 
Silent Reading, and report her reaction at the time of 
the next supervisory visit. 
1. Did the supervisor make the right beginning in solving this 
teacher’s problem? 
2. What steps will she need to take to bring this teacher to an 
intelligent use of modern teaching methods? 
Case 27 
A mature teacher in a junior high school had taught 
algebra and arithmetic for about ten years in this same 
room. She had always had the pupils copy certain

rectly in the first place. 
The teacher also sent the pupils to the board to work, 
and passed about giving help when needed. The pupils

were not to erase any work until the teacher had seen it. 
She had never used standard tests nor had she self-check- 
ing practice sheets which would enable pupils to progress 
at their individual rates. ‘ 
  1. How should the supervisor proceed to esis this teacher 
of the need for a change of method? 
2. How can the supervisor make the teacher proficient in the 
use of these modern tools which provide for individual 
differences ? 
3. What actual materials should this teacher have at hand for 
the day’s work? 
Case 28 
A supervisor entered the room of an experienced third- 
grade teacher. The room was literally a maze of lanterns 
hung on wires, of paper lace curtains, of booklets illus- 
trative of each elementary subject, and of drawings posted 
in every conceivable place. The separate pieces of the 
display were each very well planned and well executed. 
The teacher had worked hours to put these up artistically 
and harmoniously. 
As one became accustomed to the waving mass over- 
head and the completely obscured side walls, one began 
to appreciate the great amount of labor involved in keep- 
ing it in order. There was a sand table, too, and a great 
many cards tacked up bearing such messages as ‘‘I 
saw it.’’ | 
The teacher waited for the praise of her room which 
she felt one could not help expressing. 
1. What would you say to this teacher? How? 
Case 29 
The teacher, a graduate of a one-year normal course, 
was teaching her second year in a small rural schoolhouse 
which had the essential furnishings for an acceptable |   
-P-A-G-E-383
PROBLEMS IN CRITICISM 365 
school. She had not attended the county institutes nor 
any of the group meetings. Her twenty-two pupils were 
uniformly below grade, although they seemed to be nor- 
mal children. She was indifferent to suggestions. She 
did not keep her plan book up to date. She made no 
detailed assignments. Notwithstanding these facts, she 
had a fine personality and was in many respects an 
individual who was acceptable to a majority of the 
families in the district. She was in vigorous health. 
1. What can the supervisor do to stimulate this teacher to do 
her duty by the children? 
2. Would you consider this a hopeless case? Probably the 
supervisors could utilize their time to better advantage by 
overlooking the case. What would you suggest? 
Case 30 . 
This teacher was strong in leadership, knew good teach- 
ing, and had sufficient experience as principal of a two- 
room graded school to be fairly well grounded in the 
subject matter of the elementary school. She did accept- 
able work with very little effort. She had about thirty- 
eight pupils in four grades, and had done nothing to 
provide for individual differences, better grading, ete. 
On occasions she did a high grade of teaching. Often 
the work was mediocre or poor. Her general attitude 
toward the pupils was dogmatic and at times severe. 
They obeyed her, but they did not like her. 
1. How would you diagnose this case? Why has a condition 
such as hers been described? How would you proceed to 
remedy the situation? 
Case 31 
An experienced, vigorous, sixth-grade teacher with 
forty-two pupils insisted upon teaching language to 6A’s 
and 6B’s all in one group.
-P-A-G-E-384
366 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
This teacher maintained that language was language, 
and that a half-year graduation was not necessary. ‘‘ All 
pupils should be taught how to speak correctly, how to 
write correctly, and to know the parts of speech,’’ de- 
clared this teacher. The detailed course of study of the 
city was disregarded, but this teacher really secured very 
definite and valuable outcomes from the method that 
she used. 
1. What is your reaction to this situation? 
2. What action, if any, should the supervisor take?

CHAPTER XIII 
SUPERVISORY TYPES 
If supervisors might see themselves as others see them, 
supervision would doubtless be improved. As a summary 
to that which has gone before, the following descriptive 
discussions of supervisors are offered. The material is 
grouped under three headings: (1) modus operandi; 
(2) modus judicandi; and (3) modus discendi, repre- 
senting the three distinct factors in supervision: mode 
of work, technique of criticism, and method of teaching. 
I. Mopvus Oprranpt 
1. The Swivel-Chair Artist 
The title is suggestive, and to make the picture com- 
plete he should be a corpulent gentleman (or lady) who 
loves a big easy chair. He gets his ideas from class re- 
ports and reports from teachers, parents, or pupils. If 
he has a love for detail, he spends long hours over statis- 
tical reports, test scores, and tables of cost. He divides 
his time about equally between clerical detail and con- 
ferences. If the teacher wants assistance, she goes to the 
office. If reports indicate that she is in difficulty, she 
is called to the office. The teacher is expected to have 
mastered the technique of teaching or to be able to mas- 
ter it by herself. 
1The idea is by no means original. The material has been taken 
largely from the writings of Taylor, Kelley, and Morgan cited below. 
367
-P-A-G-E-386
  368 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
2. The Inspectional Type 
The supervisor comes bustling into the room in the 
midst of the recitation (it is apparent to every one that 
he has arrived), interrupts whatever is going on to say, 
“Good morning, boys and girls’’ and ‘‘Good morning, 
Miss Brown.’’ Then follows a few minutes of animated 
consultation with the teacher or some stagy fussing 
around the teacher’s desk before he finally settles down 
to work and allows the teacher to go on with the work 
that has been interrupted.2 He plans to ‘‘make the 
rounds’’ every day, spending a few minutes in each 
room. He may just walk in, give the room the ‘‘once 
over,’’? and walk out. There is usually a sigh of relief 
from the trembling teacher when he is gone. He con- 
ceives his job as that of an inspector. If the teacher’s 
work is poor he makes note of this fact or reports it 
to the superintendent. He does not give assistance. If 
he is a supervisor of several buildings, he has a regular 
schedule. When the work goes well, he visits fifty or 
sixty schools per week. 
3. The Sympathetic Helper 
He enters the room quietly, just as inconspicuously as 
possible. There is a feeling of gladness on the part of 
the teacher and pupils at his coming. He does not frown, 
take notes, or interrupt. He is there to help. Often he 
finds it necessary to spend many patient days of study and 
reflection before he is certain of the cause of difficulties. 
II. Mopus Jupicanp1r 
1. The Destructive, Cynical Type 
“There is an utter absence of any sense of humor. 
There are no jokes, no pleasantries, no geniality, no kind- 
  
Nutt, The Supervision of Instruction, pp. 201-202.
-P-A-G-E-387
SUPERVISORY TYPES 369 
liness, no charity, no fellow-feeling, no amiability, no 
generosity, no sense of the luxury of doing good. But 
there is plenty of ill nature, venom, rancor, hardness of 
heart, intolerance, inhumanity, and cruelty. Teachers 
squirm and writhe under the sharp task of the super- 
visory tongue, which seems to delight in the pain it 
inflicts. . . . He is the nagging, fault-finding supervisor 
who magnifies errors out of all proportion, and fails to 
discover and to reward merit. He is the bore of any 
school, for he discourages the teacher, carries gloom 
wherever he goes, and blasts ambition and initiative.’’ 
Above all, he is brutally frank. He knows exactly what 
he wants, and how each subject is to be taught. He has 
definite, set notions of teaching. However cut and dried 
his methods, they are to be follewed. There is no 
room left for originality, personality, or experimenta- 
tion.® 
2. The Optimistic Impressionist 
He is the good-fellow type. He gives you a warm greet- 
ing and asks about the family. He bubbles over with 
optimism. He is enthusiastic about everything that you 
do. He ‘‘throws a glamour of moonlight over the un- 
lovely facts of life, and makes actual defects appear 
as objects of beauty and delight. He is blind to defect, 
and calls poor work good, deceiving himself as well 
as the teacher under his charge. Everything is ‘sun’ 
and represented in mass without distinct form or feature. 
Such criticism is too vague to be efficient, too obscure 
to carry conviction, too superficial to be of any 
value.’’ *

pp. 1-8. 
“Taylor, loc. cit.
-P-A-G-E-388
  370 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
3. The Constructive, Codperative Type 
“Both the teacher and supervisor have a mutual under- 
standing, a mutual confidence in, and a mutual respect 
for each other. The teacher understands when the super- 
visor enters the room that he is not coming in to find 
fault, or to inspect, or to see that some pet hobby or 
some special method of teaching is being put into prac- 
tice.’’®> Such criticisms as are offered are given tactfully, 
considerately, and with a spirit of helpfulness. The atti- 
tudes of both teacher and supervisor are highly profes- 
sional. Although thoroughly scientific in spirit and pro- 
cedure, it is truly human. Such supervision recognizes 
merit, and helps the teacher to eliminate errors and 
develop what is true and beautiful. It offers assistance, 
but is not dogmatic. It says to the novice, ‘‘There is a 
method that works. Try it or devise one of your own 
that is just as good.’’ It has all the desirable elements 
of the ideal supervisor. It fosters the morale of the teach- 
ing force, sets up an attainable goal, and shows the way 
to reach it. It is fair and just, kind and thorough. It 
gets results and makes for happy teachers and happy 
children.° 
III. Mopus Discenpr? 
1. The Disciplinary Method 
Instructional materials are organized in terms of sub- 
ject matter. Assignments and recitations are in terms of 
textbooks, or textbooks supplemented by similar material

School Board Journal, June, 1924, p. 54. * Taylor, loc. cit.

Card Ratings,’ Detroit Public Schools, January, 1923, pp. 10-12, and

SUPERVISORY TYPES 3871 
presented by the teacher. The teacher attempts to pre- 
digest the lesson, and believes the amount learned depends 
largely upon her efforts in presentation and explanations. 
The pupils are expected to learn the lessons assigned. 
The recitation consists in having the children give back 
what they have learned. The teacher usually follows the 
question and answer form of recitation. Little oppor- 
tunity is given for discussions and judgments by pupils. 
Much dependence is placed upon repetition, review, and 
drill. Results in terms of knowledge, disciplinary values, 
and the habits of obedience and industry are emphasized. 
There is complete teacher control and almost perfect 
attention because of the discipline maintained. Respect 
and obedience are obtained from the children, 
2. The Socialized Method 
The efforts of the teacher are consciously directed 
toward obtaining and holding the children’s interest. 
Although the instructional materials are organized largely 
in terms of subject matter, the work is supplemented by 
a rich variety of activities. The presentation is usually 
by the topical method with much supplementary material. 
Learning by doing is emphasized. The recitation is so- 
cialized. There is more freedom of movement, more 
democracy in discipline, and teacher domination is sup- 
planted by delegation of work to groups with group 
responsibility. The characteristic feeling of teacher and 
pupils is one of comradeship. Although the teacher is in 
the background, she is always mistress of the situation, 
skillfully supplementing here, adding a shade of mean- 
ing there, and guiding the group masterfully from day 
to day. The recitation is no longer a period for reciting 
facts but for codperative learning through discussion, 
organization, and generalization—a work period under the 
teacher’s direction. Drills and reviews are less in evi-
-P-A-G-E-390
Re Re er TE eT RTC ep ae Oe ean Ree oIO MINT ee eee ae ee 
372 VISITING THE TEACHER AT WORK 
dence. Results are no longer measured wholly in terms 
of knowledge but also in terms of judgments and social 
relationships. However, the goal of both the pupils’ and 
the teacher’s work is, primarily, learning. 
3. The Purposing Method 
Class work is markedly divided into phases, part 
teacher controlled, part pupil controlled. The teacher is 
in control only during the periods of stimulation and 
reflection. Pupils are in full control during periods of 
activity, and the teacher merely assists as called upon. 
Pupils’ activity consists of the planning, executing, and 
judging essential to the accomplishment of their pur- 
poses. Lessons are set and appraised by the pupils. Class 
work and’ disciplinary control are almost completely so- 
cialized in spirit as well as in form; that is, they are 
organized and administered by the group for their own 
benefit, and not by the teacher for the benefit of the 
teacher’s plan. The use of questions, directions, ete., by 
the teacher as a means of recitation almost completely 
disappears. Emphasis is placed on purposing, on achieve- 
ment of purposes, on improvement of standards of achieve- 
ment, and on the development of ideals as the essential 
outcomes of the education process, and not on results in 
terms of knowledge and skill. There is very little learn- 
ing in the sense of committing to memory. Desirable 
knowledges and skills are acquired only as by-products 
of their use as means to ends. There is much pupil- | 
directed reference reading and much use of rich supple- 
mental material. However, functional use, not logical 
sequence, determines selection and organization of subject 
matter, so that the children in any class draw freely 
upon every subject and field that may be needed in 
carrying forward an activity; that is, content and order 
of lessons are determined almost wholly by purposes and
-P-A-G-E-391
SO ER SY on ede SUEY. Oe STO ERT oa a es Oe ee Ce ye he, aren eee 
SUPERVISORY TYPES 373 
subject matter. Divisions give way to classifications on 
the basis of activities. There is complete acceptance by 
the children of purposes as their own, of responsibility 
for direction of activity, and of the teacher as a co- 
operating member of the group. Almost perfect free- 
dom of expression is the rule, and pupils appeal for 7 
assistance to the teacher as to an equal.
